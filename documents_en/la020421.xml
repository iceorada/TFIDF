<DH>EMBATTLED DREAMS: California in War and Peace, 1940-1950,
By Kevin Starr, Oxford University Press: 386 pp., $37.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID RIEFF</AU>
<BD>David Rieff is the author of such books as "Los
Angeles: Capital of the Third World," "The Exile: Cuba in the Heart
of Miami" and the forthcoming "A Bed for the Night: Humanitarianism
in Crisis." He is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For ambition, narrative drive and breadth of research across the
disciplines from culture through politics and demography to agronomy
and water management, no recent project of American historical
writing comes close to Kevin Starr's mammoth, multi-volume "Americans
and the California Dream." For three decades, Starr has been
anatomizing the rise of California from marginal frontier society in
the 1850s to its present economic and social centrality on the
American scene. It is a magnificent accomplishment. Today, it is no
more possible to think intelligently about California without having
read Starr than it would have been, a generation earlier, to have
done so without having read Carey McWilliams. "Embattled Dreams:
California in War and Peace, 1940-1950," the latest installment of
Starr's great project, is particularly resonant because the period
described in these pages is the one in which the California of today
was shaped.</LD>
<TE>   Starr writes with extraordinary authority, and yet the definitive
quality of his work paradoxically serves to conceal the eccentricity
of his approach. For Starr is not writing history in the classical
sense of the term. Not for him the cold distance of a great European
historian like Fernand Braudel, for whom the facts were everything
and whose approach was to think in centuries. Nor is Starr motivated
by political commitments and social idealism, as was McWilliams.
Rather, Starr is a cultural historian obsessed with one big idea: the
making and remaking of California's identity. For him, material
reality is principally shaped and directed by a people's and
societies' deepest aspirations, rather than, as both Marxists and
neo-liberal globalizers have customarily believed, the other way
around. "One can follow the process of materialization," he wrote in
an earlier volume of the series, "forward from vision or metaphor to
physical fact or decode a physical object back to its original
metaphor. In each case my emphasis remains on the social and the
symbolic context of the dreams which were materialized."</TE>
<TE>   The reliance here on the language of the literary critic rather
than the historian is emblematic of Starr's approach. His California
is a world of will and ideas, and the figures he has focused on, from
Gertrude Atherton to the Hollywood Ten, really are the unacknowledged
legislators of those ideas. Put another way, Starr's project all
along has been at least as concerned with the California of the
imagination as with the California of fact and has assumed that
realities do begin in dreams. Indeed, that, for Starr, seems to be
one of the principal lessons of the California experience over the
last 150 years. It is less a question, as the slogan has it, of
California's needing men to match its mountains and more one of the
mountains' being, at least metaphorically, products of the way
Californians interpreted them.</TE>
<TE>   So it is no mere authorial conceit that the word "dream" appears
in each of Starr's titles. Rather, the idea of the dream is the
template, the master idea, into which Starr fits all his material.
This is not to say that his account of California is triumphalist. To
the contrary: Starr is at least as good a narrator of nightmares as
he is of the beauties, successes or accomplishments of the California
experience. Like McWilliams, Starr is sensitive to California's long
history of race prejudice and writes about it with fierce
indignation. And, long before such an observation became the
conventional wisdom in California, he was insisting that the
ascendancy of what he called an "Anglo-American ideology" in
California from the late 19th century through the 1960s was only
temporary and that other peoples, above all Mexicans and Mexican
Americans, were destined to reassert themselves. Nonetheless, for
Starr it is the internal visions that come first, whether for good or
for ill, and implicit in his argument has been the conviction that,
whatever the injustices and exclusions of the past, the golden
California dream could become a reality for all races, equalizing our
aspirations with those of Mexican immigrants to Okies.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere have the strengths and weaknesses of this approach been as
visible as in Starr's latest volume, "Embattled Dreams." The
importance for California of the period between the beginning of
World War II and the beginning of the Korean War can hardly be
overstated. It was the pivotal moment in the state's economic
development, as Starr is at pains to point out. Although by the 1930s
agriculture was no longer the linchpin of the California economy,
World War II was the defining moment for industrial California, the
time when the California elite no longer saw agriculture as playing
the lead role in the future. It was then that the state became, as
Starr puts it, America's "Arsenal of Democracy, training ground,
staging area, and port of embarkation" for the war in the Pacific.
The federal government spent $35 billion in the state between 1940
and 1946, 1.6 million Americans moved to California to work in
defense-related industries, and millions more came to do their Army
training. And, as Starr shows, the economic structures that were
created to fight World War II provided the basis for another wartime
economy in which California would play a lead role and on which it
would come to rely: the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   All of this is recounted by Starr with great verve. And he is even
more interesting on the way the war transformed the lives of nonwhite
Californians and of women, both white and nonwhite. Despite the cruel
tragedy of the internment of Japanese Americans which he narrates
with subtlety and compassion, and to which he gives a historical
context that is rare in discussions of the subject, Starr largely
concludes that for most groups the war was an emancipatory
experience. California's Mexican Americans were, as he puts it,
"de-barrio-ized," while a similar process took place for Chinese
Americans. And women who had worked in factories and shipyards would
never be able to return to the roles they had played before. In
anatomizing these developments, Starr offers powerful support for the
view that the groundwork for the vast social transformations that
America experienced in the 1960s was actually laid in California
during World War II. To be sure, as Starr notes in passing, some of
these same processes were taking place elsewhere in the country, but
he is not wrong to put California at their center.</TE>
<TE>   In this sense, as in a number of others, this is the first of
Starr's books to deal with a California recognizable to most people.
Many of the principal figures and stories Starr evokes in the
book--Earl Warren, Richard Nixon, the Zoot Suit riots, the
anti-communist investigations in Hollywood--still resonate and, of
course, the essentially suburban California of today was born in the
era Starr chronicles in "Embattled Dreams."</TE>
<TE>   And yet for all of the undoubted strengths of Starr's approach,
the book is oddly miscellaneous: a sometimes glorious, sometimes
tragic pageant, in which Starr moves from story to story, imposing no
particular order on his narrative beyond--or so, at least, it often
seems--its own interest. Sections on freeway construction, race
relations, Hollywood gossip (the book goes on, at some length about
the war service, or lack of it, of well-known stars of the era),
industrial development and the careers of political leaders, above
all Nixon and Warren, succeed one another at a somewhat dizzying
pace.</TE>
<TE>   Starr's reluctance to impose any more exigent structure on the
book is somewhat unsatisfying; the reader looks in vain for some
contextualization. To some extent this has been a problem for all of
Starr's books, but it seems particularly acute in this installment.
For example, the effects of the anti-communist investigation in
Hollywood are described to rich effect, but the larger questions of
what that great quarrel was about seem of little interest to Starr.
Indeed, only when he discusses racial issues does Starr seem willing
to get off his anecdotal plinth and don the motley of the social
historian in the full sense of the term. And yet, in fairness,
Starr's approach is of a piece with the argument that he has made
since he began his great project: As he put it, "my technique is
story, narrative--suggestion rather than explanation, the elusive
over the quantifiable." In the case of California in the 1940s,
Starr's method may also appear to consciously echo his claim that in
this period "the inner landscape of California--which is to say,
California as a shared social and imaginative identity--had been
fast-forwarded into futurity even beyond the state of acceleration
brought about by the Gold Rush."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, it is much harder for a historian to write with
assurance about the present than about the past, and it would be
unfair to fault Starr for refusing to be more definitive. But for all
its extraordinary qualities, there is something unsatisfying about
"Embattled Dreams," as if the whole of the book were less than the
sum of its parts. Again, the problem is not so much with Starr's
interpretation of events or people. It is true that his somewhat
hagiographical account of Warren attributes to this complicated and
ambiguous figure much of what is admirable about California's
political culture--"a knight of non-partisanship," Starr calls him,
citing the characterization of a contemporary observer. He also
associates Warren and his family with all that is seductive about
California's lifestyle, to the point of waxing romantic about
Warren's daughters, whom he describes as "golden California girls,
middle-class royalty from a middle-class state." All of this is
certainly open to debate and will doubtless draw the ire of many
historians. Rather, this miscellaneous quality, the suspicion that,
in the end, all of these stories carry the same weight, that they
are, in the end, just stories, makes Starr's book, for all its myriad
virtues, less profound and, in the end, less important than it might
otherwise be.</TE>
<TE>   McWilliams comes to mind. Starr is infinitely more learned about
California than McWilliams ever was, and his books will certainly be
more valuable to both researchers and students. And yet McWilliams'
writings on California are unforgettable. The main reason for that is
not that he was always right--it is possible to be a conservative and
still admire the leftist McWilliams--but that he was impassioned.
There is nothing wrong with dispassion. But in Starr's case,
dispassion is married to a commitment to storytelling, which is
passionate or it is nothing. And it is this contradiction that
prevents "Embattled Dreams," which is a very good book, from being a
great book.</TE>

<DH>THE MIND OF EGYPT: History and Meaning in the Time of the
Pharaohs, By Jan Assmann, Metropolitan Books:  514 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN FAGAN</AU>
<BD>Brian Fagan is the author of numerous books, including
"The Rape of the Nile: Tomb Robbers, Tourists, and Archaeologists in
Egypt." His most recent book is "The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made
History 1300-1850." He is a professor of anthropology at UC Santa
Barbara.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grand sweep of ancient Egyptian civilization encompasses 3,000
magnificent years. The Egyptians themselves were well aware of the
antiquity of their civilization. Egyptian priests at Naukratis in
Lower Egypt chided the Greek sage Solon when he talked history with
them in 530 BC. "You Hellenes," they tartly reminded him, "are but
children," and they were right.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty dynasties of pharaohs span these 3,000 years, achieving
three apogees of magnificence. The Old Kingdom was the age of
Pyramids (circa 2550 BC), the Middle Kingdom a time of high artistic
and religious achievement (circa 2000 BC) and the New Kingdom (1570
to 1070 BC) the time of Egypt's imperial glory. The great traditions
of Egyptian civilization endured another millennium, to be finally
submerged under the dictates of Rome and the beliefs of Christianity.</LD>
<LD>   Ancient Egypt exercises a powerful fascination. We live in close
familiarity with the ancient Egyptians, with the best-known pharaohs,
Cheops, Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Theirs is the face of ancient
Egypt, which is turned toward us, recovered from inscription and
papyrus and with the archeologist's spade. But there is a hidden
face, too, that of the infinitesimal changes, unnoticed by those who
experience them and visible only to the analytical gaze of the
historian.</LD>
<TE>   In his magnificent "The Mind of Egypt," Jan Assmann likens humans
to spiders, who act within the invisible webs they have woven: webs
of interaction among themselves and worlds of meaning whose horizons
define action, experience and remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   He asks what meaning Egyptians obtained from their own
constructions of their history. How did they incorporate the legacy
of the past into the present? Assmann examines patterns of continuity
and disruption. Assmann writes: "The old remained present; it never
became alien in the sense of representing something left definitively
behind."</TE>
<TE>   Using three approaches--archeological, mythic and epigraphic or
iconographic--Assmann takes us on a chronological journey, starting
with the formation of the unified state in about 3100 BC, and going
through the three great kingdoms. He ends in the late period with the
final whimpers of Egyptian civilization. The archeological and
pictorial evidence for the beginnings of Egyptian civilization
chronicles campaigns of military conquest that unified competing
city-states into a single civilization.</TE>
<TE>   The famous myth of Horus, the falcon god of Upper Egypt, uniter of
the two lands, and Seth, ancient master of Lower Egypt, symbol of
chaos, depicts them locked in deadly combat, then reconciled as the
two lands become a unified kingdom. The reconciliation of Horus and
Seth legitimizes conquest as a way of creating a world of order.
Unification became the central canon of Egyptian civilization during
the Old Kingdom, which lasted until 2150 BC.</TE>
<TE>   Assmann also identifies the fundamental dichotomy between mud
brick and stone, the latter becoming the material for monumental
edifices (and hence for immortality), the former the building
material for the living. This symbolic conjunction between the state
and immortality began in the Old Kingdom with the pyramids and other
masonry edifices.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the First Intermediate Period of about 2150 BC, when the
state fell part and chaos reigned at a time of drought and political
instability. Former provincial governors ruled their domains like
pharaohs. The life-giving Nile flooding became a mere dribble; food
riots erupted. In places, we are told, one could walk across the
river dry-shod. Assmann shows how the collapse of established order
became embedded in the Egyptian mind.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle Kingdom began with another process of unification,
followed by a great cultural apogee of civilization, which defined
the timeless and definitive expression of Egyptian
civilization--connective justice in the hereafter--into the Late
Period. The Middle Kingdom kings introduced three new ideas, derived
in part from the earlier centuries of chaos, disunity and famine: the
ruler as the son of god, the importance of loyalty and the value of
achievement.</TE>
<TE>   The provincial warlords of the chaotic centuries had practiced
patronage in exchange for loyalty. The Middle Kingdom pharaohs, who
reestablished the unified state, elevated patronage to a religious
ideology, according to which faithful adherents enjoyed success in
this world and eternal life after death. The pharaoh became a good
shepherd protecting his sheep from the wolves of chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The New Kingdom began in about 1570 BC with wars of liberation.
Thousands of Asian immigrants, many of them artisans and traders, had
flooded into Lower Egyptian towns during the prosperous Middle
Kingdom years. When succession disputes engulfed the court in Upper
Egypt in about 1640 BC, Hyksos chieftains took control of Lower Egypt
and ruled as divine pharaohs. An able ruler named Ahmose finally
routed the Hyksos in 1570 BC. His victories brought a new element
into Egyptian life: external menace, which accounts in part for the
aggressive foreign policies of Egypt's imperial pharaohs. The sun god
Amon-Re,  the dynamic force of life, creator of all deities, presided
over a state in which war and religion were inextricably linked.</TE>
<TE>   Assmann describes the wrenching effects on Egyptian culture and
religious beliefs of the heretic ruler Akhenaten, who abolished the
cult of Amon-Re and espoused a purer form of sun worship, that of the
solar disk, Aten. His experiment was short-lived. Amon-Re was
restored to favor at his death in 1335 BC. The disruptive reign of
Akhenaten fostered a break with tradition, bringing new literary
idioms and an emerging personal piety, wherein the past was the
immediate expression of the will of god.</TE>
<TE>   The strengths of ideas of Egyptian statehood were so strong that
its civilization endured for more than a millennium after the
collapse of the New Kingdom in 1070 BC. The complex meanings of the
Late Period brought new forms of religious life that related to time.
A new symbolism of passing time, as if the leaders, far more than
their predecessors, knew how transitory their world was, as if the
profound presence of the past that surrounded them reminded and
sensitized them to the fact that everything was ephemeral.</TE>
<TE>   Through the Greco-Roman period, cultural amnesia fostered by the
sheer weight of imperial dominance threatened the integrity of
Egyptian civilization as a coherent system of meaning. Pharaonic
Egypt fell silent in the late 4th century, when hieroglyphic writing
disappeared in the face of Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   But, thanks to the work of the Egyptian-born Greek priest Manetho
in the 3rd century and others, Egypt remained in the cultural
awareness of many later civilizations. Assmann points to the
compelling impressions left by pyramids and other monuments, to
biblical and classical texts that described Egypt as a living
culture. As he rightly argues, it is wrong to write of historical
oblivion until Jean-Francois Champollion deciphered hieroglyphs with
the aid of the Rosetta Stone in 1822, as many Egyptologists and other
authors, including this reviewer, have assumed.</TE>
<TE>   Assmann has looked closely into the mirror of the ancient
intangible with telling effect. Every student of early civilization
has something to learn from these pages, which will help cure us of
intellectual myopia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Mind of Egypt'</TE>
<TE>   History has two faces, one turned toward us, the other averted.
The face turned toward us is the sum total of event and remembrance.
It is history recalled by those involved in it, as shapers or
witnesses, doers or sufferers. The hidden face of history is not what
we have forgotten, but what we have never remembered, those products
of imperceptible change, extended duration, and infinitesimal
progression that go unnoticed by living contemporaries and only
reveal themselves to the analytic gaze of the historian.</TE>

<HD>Four Questions for Kevin Starr</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What interests you about writing history?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: I'm interested in telling stories, in capturing those
moments when the internal imagined experience intersects with social
reality. Individual lives give this experience context. I have to be
adept at telling the tale and using the factual record. I have to be
particularly choosy about which facts I get to keep.</LD>
<LD>   Q: What aspect of California history interests you most?</LD>
<TE>   A: I find the more I come up to the present in this series, the
more I recognize people I knew and the more I remember events I saw
as a child. I was born in 1940; that's really the world that shaped
me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Who is the most surprising character in California history?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'd have to say Henry J. Kaiser, who had an eccentric Wizard of
Oz personality. He was able to reconcile the world of business with
the world of social responsibility: workers' rights, pensions and
housing. He was a titanic figure. I think we'll come to value him
more and more in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is your favorite place in California?</TE>
<TE>   A: Room 200 in the California State Library in Sacramento. I've
been the state librarian going on eight years, a post in which I have
the privilege of serving the people of California. I have always
wanted to be in public service. This role is an honor and a challenge
to which I bring all my past lives and skills, as a historian, a
teacher and a Californian.</TE>

<AU>VIVIAN GORNICK</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is the author, most recently, of "The
Situation and the Story: The Art of Personal Narrative."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writers of personal narrative--that is, of memoirs and essays--are
often accused by readers who meet them of not sufficiently resembling
their own narrators. This happened a lot to George Orwell. The
persona that he created in countless books and essays--that of Orwell
the involuntary truth speaker, an essence of democratic decency--was
something genuine that he pulled from himself to serve his writer's
need to be witness to the politics of his time; yet it was hardly his
ordinary, everyday self. Orwell was a man often at the mercy of his
own mean insecurities. In life he could act and sound ugly
(revisionist biographies now have him not only a sexist and an
obsessed anti-communist but possibly an informer as well). Readers
who met him at dinner could be disconcerted.</LD>
<TE>   It's a problem for everyone who writes this kind of nonfiction:
being both yourself and not yourself on the page. In 1972, I went to
Egypt, under contract, to write a book about middle-class Cairenes.
The Egyptians were warm, nervous, volatile. It had always been my
style as a journalist to "be myself"--that is, to speak freely and
provocatively and make a story out of the response I got--and I knew
that here in Cairo I had, as well, to act naturally. But my
full-blown, unmediated self--at the time I was on the barricades for
radical feminism every minute that I was conscious--put most
Egyptians off rather quickly. To do my work, I'd have to put a lid on
it.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, I found that if I responded to this instead of to
that, kept habitual judgment to myself, asked fewer leading
questions, remained absorbed when bored or restless, I was able to
get on quite well. More than quite well. As I brought myself steadily
under greater control, I felt myself seeing and hearing differently.
I started enjoying the difference, even cultivating it.</TE>
<TE>   Then an astonishing thing happened. The difference became an
identity inside of which I began to live. In time, this identity
became my instrument of illumination: It told the story of Egypt I
wanted to tell. A few months after the book was published, a woman at
a dinner party said accusingly to me, "You're nothing like the woman
in the book!" Later in the evening she said, "I take that back ....
You're something like her." But the discrepancy disturbed her. She
clearly had wanted to have dinner with the narrator of the book she
had read, not with me.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no one stopped reading Orwell because he'd been a
disappointment in the flesh. Actually, he was even more a joy on the
page if you had met him. There, his voice came through as one richly
in service to an intelligence that was consistently clarifying and
reliable. The reliability made the Orwell narrator trustworthy. The
trustworthiness was irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   Now, here's a distinction worth making between the fictional
narrator and the nonfictional narrator. The fictional narrator can be
and often famously is unreliable; from "The Good Soldier" to "Remains
of the Day," the unreliable narrator in a novel serves a writer's
deeper intention. The ignorance or cunning or self-deception of such
a narrator is often key to the larger tale's being told. But this
conceit will never work in nonfiction. Duplicate that unreliable
narrator in a memoir and you have literary disaster. The nonfiction
narrator has many of the rights and responsibilities of the fictional
one but does not have the right to be unreliable. To the contrary, it
must always persuade the reader that--to the best of its ability--it
is speaking truth.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking truth, of course, is sometimes a tricky affair, having
more to do with what a memoirist intends than with what he or she
actually says. Take Thomas De Quincey, one of the most neurotic
narrators in English literature. In "Confessions of an English
Opium-Eater," he purports to tell us the real, true story of how he
came to be addicted to opium. The prose is thrilling, and for the
longest time we do not question anything De Quincey tells us. Yet
much that is described begins to seem puzzling, not adequately
explained or accounted for. We soon realize that the narrator is not
coming clean. We can see what he himself cannot bear to look at
directly. At the same time, De Quincey shows us the consequence of
what he has lived through with such power that, reading between the
lines, we are moved by the narrator's inability to stare down his own
terrible anxieties. The sheer cleverness of the account of his
downfall--the self-deluded explanation for why he remained so long in
the gutter--bears intimately on this very incapacity. What is
important is that De Quincey lets us see--clearly and
unmistakably--what he himself cannot. He falls in with prostitutes,
thieves, traveling strangers whom he might describe variously as
pathetic, suspicious, treacherous; but clearly these people are often
mothering him, furthering his adventure, ensuring survival. We never
feel that he is lying to us. It is this that makes him--in a large,
rueful, touching way--a reliable reporter. We cannot forgive the
nonfiction narrators who, in lying to themselves, also lie to us.
Those are the narrators we declare unreliable and theirs the memoirs
we judge untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   I remember once teaching Lillian Hellman's "An Unfinished Woman"
at a small state university. My students were intelligent and
responsive, but they hadn't a clue as to who or what Hellman was (or
Dashiell Hammett or the Cold War, for that matter). They came to the
book with no opinions, preconceived or otherwise. And they didn't
like it. As Hellman is a skillful writer with a compelling sense of
narrative, I was surprised and asked why. The narrator didn't inspire
confidence, they said. Essentially, they didn't believe her. What do
you mean? I asked. Do you think she's making things up? No, they
replied, but they didn't think things had happened the way she was
telling it. Why? I pursued. "She always comes out looking good," one
blurted out. "It's as if she wrote it to let you know she's better
than the people around her," said another. "Yeah," they all chorused.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the writing had struck them as self-serving.
Self-serving is the kiss of death. Once a piece of writing feels
self-serving, the whole project is under suspicion. This was what had
made Hellman an untrustworthy reporter to her young readers. It was
doubly startling for me to reread "An Unfinished Woman" through their
eyes. I remember being as enraptured as everyone else when the book
appeared. "Ruthlessly honest," we all thought, agreeing with the
adoring reviews. Now, 20 years later, I saw what the students saw,
and I no longer found it honest: That's what you call a middle-brow
success, at one with its moment but unable to stand the test of time.
The students were right. She was not reliable. Edmund Gosse was
reliable, Orwell was reliable, on occasion even Colette was reliable,
but Hellman was not. Mary McCarthy had been wrong to accuse Hellman
of lying. It hadn't mattered where she put the ifs, ands and buts
(that is, whether she was idealizing her life or not). It mattered a
great deal, though, that she seemed to be speaking in service to
nothing larger than her own small self.</TE>
<TE>   Which leads us to the real obligation of the nonfiction narrator:
She or he must be speaking about something, something beyond one's
own small self. In fact, one's own small self is never the subject:
It is always--and only--the means of engagement with a subject beyond
the self. A perfect example of a writer who understands the principle
very well--and who succeeds and fails admirably at it--is Joan
Didion.</TE>
<TE>   For Didion, ordinary everyday anxiety is an organizing principle.
Out of it she has created a depressed quivering persona that serves
her talent wonderfully and has achieved some of the finest essays in
American literature. In her novels the anxiety is always in danger of
becoming the story rather than serving the story--and there, in my
opinion, she fails dismally. But in the essays, in which a subject
beyond the self must be intersected--migraine headache, the Black
Panthers, California and the American Dream--Didion's gorgeous nerves
are, more often than not, brought under brilliant control. It is in
this form that her existential nervousness is developed with such
artistry that insight transforms--and literature is made--through the
naked use of the writer's emotional disability.</TE>
<TE>   The history of the nonfiction narrator is long indeed, reaching
back at least to classical Greece and Rome in the West (Seneca and
Plutarch) and to 10th century Japan in the East (Lady Murasaki's
"Tale of Genji," Sei Shonagon's "Pillow Book"). The more one reads of
memoir and essay, the more easily one sees what a major contribution
this narrator has made to the literature of the world. As the
centuries have worn on, and the very idea of the self has undergone
profound change--from whole to fragmented, familiar to alien, real to
surreal--the reliable narrator in nonfiction has kept pace,
reinventing itself with a strength and a resourcefulness that are
quite remarkable.</TE>

<HD>Being There</HD>
<DH>FRANKLIN FLYER, A Novel, By Nicholas Christopher, Dial
Press: 322 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day of the 1929 stock market crash, a young man climbs to the
roof of a New York skyscraper. Unlike the ruined investors soon to
jump from such heights, he exudes optimism and freedom. A gust of
wind snatches off his yellow fedora and swoops it through a window of
a neighboring building. Tracking it down, he finds it in an empty
office, along with a photo of a woman whose face--seemingly a
composite of many faces--will haunt him the rest of his life.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholas Christopher's fourth novel opens with these images, as
visual as frames in a comic book. We can see the young man
silhouetted against the sky, the plunging view to the street, the
yellow hat on its unerring course, the enigmatic picture. The novel's
characters are sketched quickly and, as it were, with a broad brush;
the action is compressed and, as in comics, freighted with fatality
and symbolism. Those for whom the 1930s and '40s are memories as well
as history will know what kind of comics inspired Christopher. "Terry
and the Pirates" and "The Phantom" are examples: quasi-realistic
action mixed with romance and trademark elements, such as the
Phantom's skin-tight suit, that alerted us that the protagonist,
however much he resembled an ordinary human being, was, in fact,
something quite different: a hero.</LD>
<TE>   On the surface, Franklin Flyer (named for a passenger train whose
crash he survived at birth) is an exemplary young American of his
time: bright, talented, handy with his fists, an inventor and a
patriot. It's the trademarks that reveal him to be more and less than
that--the name, the yellow fedora, the faithful cat (survivor of an
Antarctic shipwreck) who accompanies Flyer through all his adventures
and whose night vision prompts him to develop infrared technology for
the military in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher ("A Trip to the Stars") allots one chapter of this
novel to each year from 1929 through 1942. Each chapter, like an
individual comic book in a series, is a self-contained episode but is
linked to the others.</TE>
<TE>   Comics require fine craftsmanship, and the episodes (in Argentina,
in Ku Klux Klan territory, in Mussolini's Italy, in Vichy France) are
admirably concise. Through his choice of method, Christopher lets us
tap into moral certainties about a bygone age (Fascists are bad,
isolationists are fools) and, as in "Ragtime" and "Forrest Gump,"
allows his fictional characters to mingle with historical figures,
from actress Rita Hayworth to OSS chief "Wild Bill" Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   As a hero, not just a person, Flyer escapes one tight spot after
another as he battles Nazis and their sympathizers for control of the
world's supply of zilium, a rare but indestructible metal that the
Axis seeks to make its forces bulletproof. His career advances in
near-magical leaps. With profits from his first patented invention, a
machine that jiggles a paint can to mix the paint, he buys a firm
that publishes adventure comics, of course, with titles such as
"River Detective" and "Diamond Courier."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the charm of "Franklin Flyer" is its nostalgia for the era
of the individual tinkerer, before the war made technology the domain
of vast organizations. Flyer goes to the library, reads up on "vacuum
tubes, cathode rays, the conductivity of metals and the evolution of
the electron tube filament," and voila! He makes a key contribution
to David Sarnoff's pioneering work on television.</TE>
<TE>   Only Flyer's love life is dogged by misfortune. Searching for the
woman in the picture, he has relationships with Narcissa, a
self-destructive jazz singer; Pamela, a beauty disfigured by
jealousy; Persephone, an editor at his firm who has an unsettling
knowledge of ancient Egyptian lore; and Agnes, an OSS agent who leads
him into his most dangerous adventure. Along the way, he discovers
that he has a daughter, Leda--another mythological name--whose
fatherless childhood has mirrored his own.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Christopher gives Flyer a full complement of motivations
and vulnerabilities, as if he were a person and this were a realistic
novel. We tend to overlook this because the action is so fast and
because we're so sure, on account of the trademarks, that he's a
hero.</TE>
<TE>   Like zilium--which is imaginary and, as ultimate weapons go, no
match for the atomic horrors the real world of the '40s was
brewing--Flyer can't quite escape the world of the comics, even when,
in the novel's mystical conclusion, Christopher wants him to.</TE>

<HD>The Wild One</HD>
<DH>RIDIN' HIGH, LIVIN' FREE: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories,
By Ralph "Sonny" Barger With Keith Zimmerman  and Kent Zimmerman,
William Morrow: 260 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HERBERT GOLD</AU>
<BD>Herbert Gold's nonfiction books, "Haiti: Best Nightmare
on Earth" and "The Magic Will: Stories and Essays of a Decade" have
been reissued with new material.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonny Barger, founder of the Hells Angels, along with his
collaborators, Keith and Kent Zimmerman, authors of last year's
memoir, "Hell's Angel," begin this scrappy sequel--a collection of
tales both true and possibly partly true--with a story about Richard
Charles "Gypsy" Anderson, R.I.P., and of what "put the zap in his
head." The zap was put there by the Marlon Brando motorcycle movie,
"The Wild One," back in 1954.</LD>
<LD>   I, too, four-eyed novelist and boy husband, saw "The Wild One"
under ideal circumstances when I stumbled into a we-never-close
triple-feature fleabag movie house on Woodward Avenue in downtown
Detroit. After the movie, in the men's room (don't worry), I watched
a posse of mini-Brandos admiring themselves and their leather jackets
in the mirror. They also wanted to be motorcycle hoods, although they
looked more like Sal Mineo than Brando. I just wanted to be a writer.</LD>
<LD>   Besides Sonny, Anderson is the hero of this book, dying of liver
and kidney disease after beatings, overdoses and staying up late
couldn't kill him. The stories emphasize pride in tattoos, patches,
treasured cycles and "rat-packing," which is a form of group (let's
not say "gang") battering of someone who commits an act of disrespect
or is caught considering such an act. Hells Angels prefer the word
"club" to "gang."</LD>
<TE>   When I interviewed Sonny for Rolling Stone magazine a couple of
years back--it doesn't seem right to call him Mr. Barger, even in
this dignified venue--he expressed ironic detachment from the murders
and other distressing incidents that seemed to gather in his
presence. He served jail and prison terms for various offenses. He
allowed to a history of substance abuse, such as the cigarettes that
led to cancer of the larynx, but what about that other stuff? Rumors?
A philosophic shrug. People pick on the Angels because that's how
people are, but the Angels are really just a kind of, oh, fraternity
of like-minded, frequently oppressed lads who ride demufflered
motorcycles, as Sonny suggests here, "to clear their heads, feel the
wind, and experience freedom." It's the American way, as the American
way should be.</TE>
<TE>   Later in "Ridin' High, Livin' Free," Sonny expands on this
philosophy by telling the story of movie star fellow traveler, Steve
McQueen, who "wanted to break away from the plastic Hollywood
lifestyle. He yearned to expand his mind and simplify his life."</TE>
<TE>   He bought motorcycles and airplanes. He fell for a model. They
rode together. "He loved the effect beer had on him in the mile-high
altitudes of Colorado." He also loved what he called his "vitamin C
pills." He was at a "serious spiritual juncture in his life. McQueen
craved stability and peace of mind." With the help of his loving new
wife, he pursued this goal relentlessly, growing his hair long. "The
couple would ride motorcycles, drink beer, shoot guns, and play with
the coyotes." At his death, he left a collection of cycles, planes,
funky dwellings and knickknacks, although his wife had insisted on a
new washer-dryer.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasis on McQueen's expanded mind is significant because it
indicates the inner life of these rough boys. They have borrowed a
warrior picture of themselves, livin' free and ridin' high, and they
play out their lives in roles that can give losers the sense that
they are not losers. Sonny was their leader because he was and still
is media-savvy, charming and energetic, despite his present
infirmities. He has reached the age of nostalgia. His memory is
pretty good and his mind is pretty inventive.</TE>
<TE>   He still rides; he retains his street credo. There is a warmth in
his tribute to McQueen: "His favorite thing in all the world was to
hang out with the boys, chug beer, and check out bikes." Some of the
stories and photographs in this book give a sense of being mined from
"Hell's Angel." When I asked Sonny about that, he sometimes expanded
nicely and sometimes looked puzzled: "Where'd they get that? Maybe
from my sister."</TE>
<TE>   It's fun to listen to romantic tales of hell-and-heck-raising by a
man now in his mid-60s, settled down in a ranchette near Phoenix,
where he served his last sentence in a federal pen, with a pretty
young wife who rides, a preteen stepdaughter who also rides, a few
heart attacks and a cancer surgery behind him and memories, memories.
He raises Old Glory on his flagpole every morning and takes it down
at sunset, folding it reverently against his bosom.</TE>

<DH>ANTHONY BLUNT: His Lives, By Miranda Carter, Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux: , 590 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS</AU>
<BD>Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and
the Nation, and the author of, most recently, "Letters to a Young
Contrarian."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If I declare an interest in this book, I also confess a tiny
resentment. As far as I know, I was by a narrow margin the first
person to name Sir Anthony Blunt, in print, as the long-sought
"fourth man" of Soviet penetration in the British Secret Service. I
did so in the New Statesman in 1979, narrowly beating (allowing for
discrepant deadlines and publication dates) the editors of the
satirical magazine Private Eye, who get the credit in Miranda
Carter's book and elsewhere. This may seem a petty way of approaching
a major scandal, but the struggle to publish an open secret was and
is an important key to understanding the surreal world in which Blunt
rose, flourished, prospered--and ultimately fell like Lucifer. I knew
that Sir Anthony was the culprit, but had I simply published the
fact, I could have been exposed to a very serious suit for libel. I
could also have involved myself in breaking the Official Secrets Act,
which defines almost all public information in Britain as state
property.</LD>
<TE>   However, the Fleet Street press had got wind of the fact that the
guilty man's name had five letters, began with B and belonged to a
person who had been at Cambridge University in the 1930s. At least
one blameless don--a man named Donald Beves--had been extensively
calumniated in The Times (of London) for no better reason. (Oddly
enough, the author of the original rumor was a journalist with the
equally suspect name of Andrew Boyle, who produced a sensational book
titled "The Climate of Treason.") A climate of something more like
witch-hunting had resulted. There seemed no good reason to allow this
to go on, since the British authorities had known since 1964 that
Blunt had been an agent of the KGB. So I went ahead and ventilated
the name, body-guarding my disclosure with various careful phrases
about how Sir Anthony was innocent until proved guilty and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   What a relief it was when Margaret Thatcher rose in the House of
Commons a short while afterward to confirm what the establishment had
so long kept to itself. Her statement had one very important feature,
which is missing from Carter's "Anthony Blunt: His Lives," and indeed
from most accounts of the Cambridge spy saga. Seeking to explain how
it was that so many double agents had infiltrated British
intelligence, she said that in 1939 and 1940, there had been some
rather hasty recruitment to meet the Nazi menace, and a few rather
dubious characters had therefore slipped through the mesh. This was
in fact, in the guise of an excuse, an enormous admission. It
involved conceding that, until almost too late, the establishment
spymasters had been either indifferent to Hitler or somewhat
sympathetic to him.</TE>
<TE>   That ugly but plain fact, with its corollaries, had provided the
future traitors with their justification as well as their
opportunity. Kim Philby, the most successful mole of all time, had
pretended to be a Nazi sympathizer in order to get himself recruited
by MI6. He had gone to Spain to report glowingly from the Franco side
and joined the pro-Hitler Anglo-German League. His collaborators, Guy
Burgess and Donald Maclean, were not so flamboyant in their deception
but were motivated by a similar hatred and contempt for an upper
class that had been so collusive with fascism throughout the 1930s.
Until his death in 1995, one of the most successful of the British
double agents, John Cairncross, lived unprosecuted in France, where
he was an acknowledged expert on Moliere, Racine and Corneille. He
was distinctly proud of having sent the Soviet Union wartime
information about tanks and other materiel, which is credited by
historians with having helped the Red Army to win the Battle of
Kursk.</TE>
<TE>   Since most of us do not wish that the Kursk salient had fallen the
other way, nobody has ever quite nerved himself to call Cairncross a
traitor. However, the relatively idealistic Cairncross was one of
those with access to the crucial codes known as "Enigma," and it has
been speculated, most notably by British historian and former
intelligence officer Hugh Trevor-Roper, that anyone sharing these
with Stalin at the wrong moment could have ended up, even if
unintentionally, also sharing them with Hitler. Cairncross' name,
incidentally, was given to the British authorities by Blunt as part
of the plea bargain by which he saved his own skin. I am stressing
this macro-political dimension because Carter, in what is a mostly
excellent case study, has chosen to concentrate almost exclusively on
the interior psyche of her subject. Without the inconveniences of his
second career as a spy, Blunt might well have become internationally
recognized as an art critic. His work on Nicolas Poussin, though
challenged by subsequent art historians, certainly assisted in
establishing the seriousness with which that painter is now taken.
(Blunt's insistence on the primacy of the aesthetic trumped all his
other loyalties: He could never bring himself to praise Picasso's
"Guernica" even when the party line might have mandated otherwise.)</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the word "loyalties" in that last sentence is too
generous. What Carter suggests is that Blunt, through various
lifelong mechanisms of denial and concealment, succeeded in making a
mockery of the very idea of loyalty. The perfect spy (to annex a
phrase of John le Carre's) is likely to be someone wounded in
childhood and made accustomed to coldness and deceit. Sometimes, but
not as often as the cliches--or prejudices--of the convention
suggest, such a person will be a homosexual with a certain innate
"tradecraft" of oblique signals and dual identity (neither Philby nor
Cairncross, however, was gay.) Blunt's own evolution--spoiled
mother's boy, precocious student, intellectual snob, art collector,
raging queen--is almost a caricature of the genre, and it is Carter's
achievement in "Anthony Blunt: His Lives" to have promoted it above
the commonplace. She makes excellent use of Blunt's boyhood
friendship with the poet Louis MacNeice, who shared his 1930s
anti-authority views (and supplied a connection between him and the
Auden-Isherwood school) but who distrusted his nihilism and his lofty
scorn for lesser mortals.</TE>
<TE>   For Blunt, Stalinism was another form of elitism. Carter
illustrates the point by lavish description of the wild and bohemian
life lived by Blunt and his louche set, from the fringes of
Bloomsbury through the years of devil-may-care London blitz partying.
Barely a literary name of the period is omitted, and even those who
later disapproved (like Malcolm Muggeridge) seem to have accepted the
invitations. The giddiness of all this affects the author, who
permits herself sentences like this one: "Why Blunt went from
talent-spotter to double agent, passing information to a foreign
power--for there was no question in 1940 that he was working for
anything other than the Soviet Union, with whom Britain was at
war--was a question even he could never satisfactorily answer."
"Anything" becomes "whom," and Britain is at war with the wrong
country: The wilderness of mirrors becomes a cracked syntax, but on
with the show. One still gets the point that people in the treason
trade did not consider themselves bound by ordinary rules. And in
that respect, at least, they shared something with the Establishment
they claimed to despise.</TE>
<TE>   When Blunt was first secretly arraigned for his treachery in 1952
and '53, it was hastily agreed that, in return for a full confession,
he should be allowed to keep his job as curator of the queen's art
collection. (Only when this deal became public was he stripped,
ridiculously and vindictively, of his knighthood.) It seems thinkable
that he also had some inconvenient knowledge of the royal family's
Nazi connections; this cupboard is so full of old bones that it is
hard to assemble a skeleton with them. At any rate, the British
ruling elite was quite content to keep a prominent mole as a kind of
pensioner in order to avoid scandal and, only when the scandal became
uncontainable, to throw him to the wolves.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's closing chapters, on the hysteria and mobbish
self-righteousness that followed, are perhaps her best. Two insights
are latent in this book, though they are sometimes not quite apparent
even to its author. The first is that the Cold War had a private
logic of its own, in which those engaged in covert action had more in
common with one another than they cared to admit. The second--itself
overlaid by the Cold War--is the fact that men like Blunt joined "the
struggle" after the Hitler-Stalin pact and, in some ways, because of
it rather than despite it. This book is the record, not of a
subversive--let alone of a revolutionary--but of an empty, resentful
cynic who had a bad instinct, but an instinct nevertheless, for
staying on the winning side.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to Book Review,
is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The
Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Tom Cruise gay? Is Jamie Lee Curtis a hermaphrodite? Did Cass
Elliot choke to death on a ham sandwich? Was Charles Manson an agent
of the FBI?</LD>
<LD>   All of these questions are asked--and answered--by Paul Young in
"L.A. Exposed," an exercise in mythmaking and myth-breaking that is
more earnest than its title suggests. Each of the 130 or so entries
in "L.A. Exposed" is presented in a lurid tabloid-style layout, but
the text is purely ironic: Young is a self-appointed debunker, and he
delights in deconstructing the elaborate folklore that has attached
itself to Los Angeles and its more celebrated and notorious denizens,
ranging from Fatty Arbuckle to Bugsy Siegel to the Hillside
Strangler.</LD>
<LD>   "Some call them rumors or hearsay, others call them urban legends
or myths, and others still call them gossip or tall tales," writes
Young. "I wanted to explore those narratives that are everywhere and
nowhere at the same time; those narratives that guide us through the
streets when we wander, spark everyday conversations, and fuel our
imaginations, anxieties, and premonitions."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, "L.A. Exposed" is a study in fear and loathing. A great
many of the rumors, for instance, betray an acute and pervasive sense
of homophobia among stargazers in the mass media. Jim Morrison, John
Travolta, David Geffen, Keanu Reeves and Rod Stewart are among the
celebrities whose sexual orientation and sexual practices have been
the subjects of overheated speculation, all of which may say more
about the gossip-mongers than about the stars whose exploits, real or
imagined, are their stock in trade. "Scandal," writes Young, quoting
critic Richard de Cordova, "is the primal scene of all star
discourse."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, by way of example, Young traces the persistent rumors about
Cruise--Is he gay? Is he sterile? Or is he merely celibate?--to a
catty but surely jesting remark by one of his former wives, Mimi
Rogers, who once cracked that their marriage ended because Tom was
thinking of becoming a monk. "[H]e thought that he had to be celibate
to maintain the purity of his instrument," she told Playboy in 1990.
And, though Young concludes that there is no evidence that Cruise is
gay, he argues that Cruise himself has stoked the controversy by
protesting too much that he isn't. "The vehemence of Cruise's denial
of homosexuality," Young points out, "can be measured by the size of
his libel suits."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the urban legends in "L.A. Exposed" are more famous than
others. I had never heard the rumor that "Fidel Castro appeared in
numerous Hollywood movies before his career as Cuba's Communist
dictator" until I read Young's book. (The rumor is false, according
to Young.) And some of the questions that Young asks in print are not
actually answered: He concedes, for instance, that we still don't
know with certainty who killed the mysterious woman known to
reporters of the late 1940s as the Black Dahlia.</TE>
<TE>   Young's most common finding, not surprisingly, is that any given
rumor is "purely speculative" or "not likely" or "almost certainly
false." That's his conclusion about the reports that Richard Gere
used a gerbil as a sex toy, that Charles Manson was an FBI operative
and Santa Ana winds move some of us to murder, as Raymond Chandler so
famously asserted in the short story "Red Wind." "In fact, from 1978
to 1998," writes Young, "the homicide rate actually went down during
the months of peak Santa Ana activity."</TE>
<TE>   Only rarely is an urban legend shown to be true. The Japanese
Imperial Navy did, in fact, shell an oil storage facility in Goleta
on Feb. 23, 1942. Nuclear waste is actually buried on the site of the
Barrington Recreational Center in Brentwood. And Barney's Beanery in
West Hollywood displayed a sign that coarsely excluded gay patrons,
although the owner insisted that it was only a joke and later took it
down.</TE>
<TE>   Now and then, Young suggests, truth is even stranger than fiction
when it comes to an urban legend. He entertains a series of
provocative theories about the death of Elliot, a member of the Mamas
and the Papas: "Did the mob get revenge? Did she squeal on the wrong
guys? Did a drug dealer have her killed?" None of the theories can be
proved, but on one point he is utterly sure of his information: "What
is known however is that she didn't choke to death on a ham
sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. Exposed" is so provocative, so intriguing and yet ultimately
so smart and so sensible that it is tempting to pick up and almost
impossible to put down. Even when he is expertly defusing a myth or
legend, Young passes along some tidbit that is nearly as intriguing
as the one he has just proved false. Young insists that the rumor
that Curtis was born a hermaphrodite is "almost certainly false," for
example, but he reports that Joan of Arc, Eva Braun and Elizabeth
"Black Dahlia" Short all suffered from the so-called androgen
insensitivity syndrome that causes some female infants to be born
with male genitalia.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what Young has collected in "L.A. Exposed" is a matter of
lively interest far beyond the city limits. But he insists that Los
Angeles is a place that "revel[s] in rumors, hearsay, and gossip,"
and he traces the tradition all the way back to the native
Californians and the Spanish conquistadors who told tall tales about
one another. "Los Angeles remains the most imagined city in the
country," he argues, "one that was born in myth and nurtured on
celluloid."</TE>
<TE>   A far more benign vision of Hollywood is conjured in "The Keystone
Kid" by Coy Watson Jr., a man who was born into the movie business in
1912. His family was living in a community called Edendale, north of
Echo Park Lake, where the first motion picture studios in Southern
California were already in operation and where the neighbors included
Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Mabel Normand, Marie Dressler and
Arbuckle.</TE>
<TE>   "[N]early everything that happened in Edendale had something to do
with the motion picture business," Watson recalls. "When we passed
Aaron Street, we spoke to the cowboys who had ridden their horses to
congregate at the corner... each hoping to get a call to work in a
picture." The going rate, he reports, was "$1.00 for each man and
$2.00 for a horse!"</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of Watson's family found work in the movies, whether
as bit players or stunt riders, assistant directors or prop handlers.
His father was among the very first special-effects men and animal
trainers in Hollywood. "Little Coy" was only 9 months old when he was
cast in his first role, commanding $5 for a day's work in a silent
flick starring a young actor from New York named Lon Chaney. Watson
appeared so often in Mack Sennett's series of "Keystone Cop" comedies
that he was dubbed "the Keystone Kid."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 18, Watson had appeared in 65 motion pictures,
ranging from "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" to "Puttin' on the Ritz,"
and the filmography for the Watson siblings exceeds 1,000 movies.
"The Five Watsons," as the Watson brothers styled themselves, ran a
1928 trade paper advertisement for themselves; they ranged in age
from 1 to 16. Their message: "All Real Motion Picture Troupers in
PICTURES!" Although all of the Watson brothers eventually came to
earn their living as photographers, the family was honored with its
own collective star on Hollywood Boulevard in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The whole saga is washed in the honey tones of nostalgia. "I have
labored to write some true, simple, everyday stories of my boyhood,"
explains Watson, "a remembrance of the early days of filmmaking."
"The Keystone Kid" is an authentic, intimate and endearing memoir of
the movie industry in its pioneering era, an account that allows us
to see what Hollywood was like for those men, women and children
whose experiences are overlooked by gossip mongers and even film
historians.</TE>

<DH>POWER PLAYS: Win or Lose--How History's Great Political
Leaders Play the Game, By Dick Morris, ReganBooks: 360 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW H. MALCOLM</AU>
<BD>Andrew H. Malcolm, a former foreign and national
correspondent, editor, government and campaign spokesman, is the
author of such books as "Final Harvest" and "The Canadians." He is a
member of the Times' Editorial Board.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's baaack--again.</LD>
<LD>   And this time Dick Morris is full of political advice from dead
people--dead politicians, actually. You remember Morris. He's died
too, several times, politically. There were the times he consulted
for both sides of the political aisle (and may or may not have
detailed that for clients). And there was that tabloid expose with
the prostitute just as Morris' client, President Bill Clinton, was
accepting the Democratic nomination in 1996. Mere momentary setbacks
in modern politics. Clinton valued Morris' advice so highly that he
later smuggled him into the White House to share his expertise in
secret, keeping it quiet even from devoted official presidential
staff. And Morris' polls told the president he should vacation in
Wyoming. So he did.</LD>
<LD>   Today, as living proof that scandals may perish but flamboyant
celebrities in modern America never die and never fade away, the
repackaged Morris resides on the Fox News Channel, where he dispenses
political opinion, candid advice and sometimes accurate
prognostications to viewers who aren't paying for any of it.</LD>
<TE>   "Power Plays," his fifth book, is a clever idea, cleverly titled
and cleverly outlined--clever like one of those book ideas, book
titles and book outlines from Judith Regan at HarperCollins which, by
golly, according to Morris' acknowledgments, it indeed was. The
outspoken Regan, you may recall, dispenses her own opinions on her
own show on Fox, which, like HarperCollins, is owned by Rupert
Murdoch. So you see the strategic political connections in this book
on political strategies. No coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   In this book, Morris examines some moves by politically great and
not-so-great men. (Apparently Regan's outline did not include
detailed mention of female political leaders such as Britain's
Margaret Thatcher). In a fairly breezy style suitable for television,
Morris breaks his examination of political strategies into six
categories: Stands on Principle, Triangulation, Divide and Conquer,
Reform Your Own Party, Using New Technology and Mobilizing Your
Nation at a Time of Crisis. Whether Morris is the best-qualified
person to examine political principles might make good shouting
fodder on "The O'Reilly Factor," which also happens to appear on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   You'd better like politics and history to read "Power Plays."
You'll see some patterns you may or may not have noticed: How Winston
Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan held
to their principles, lost, suffered political exile and returned,
possibly repackaged, to triumph in a changed society while Woodrow
Wilson, Barry Goldwater and someone named Al Gore all failed. Except
we might need another epilogue if, in coming months, Gore's latest
repackaging gains "traction" (a favored expression of political
consultants).</TE>
<TE>   Written for a generation that gets its news from TV and the Web,
Morris' sections on how Churchill and FDR crafted political intimacy
and support through this newfangled thing called radio are
enlightening. But perhaps Morris' best sections deal with
triangulation, a process in which a politician confounds his
opposition and neutralizes its supporters by co-opting its issues
while protecting his standing among his own political supporters.</TE>
<TE>   American journalism too often treats politics as a mere spectator
sport full of duplicity, rather than as the machinations of
participants in a complex democracy reflecting through their
maneuvers the complex and often conflicting and hypocritical feelings
of inattentive voters. Understanding these professional strategies
sheds light on our democracy's inner workings and on how we can be
manipulated. Since open attacks on opponents can ricochet, it's just
as effective politically to lure opposition supporters or simply
weaken their fervor by seeming to adopt some of their stands.</TE>
<TE>   Under Morris' guidance, triangulation worked brilliantly for
Clinton, a Democrat who took his own carefully publicized micro-steps
to appear to address Republican values and issues such as welfare
reform, budget deficits and crime while not thoroughly abandoning the
Democratic agenda. Without Morris' advice, Republican Nelson
Rockefeller's bids in the 1960s to reach moderates and liberals,
while not strengthening his conservative standing, spelled doom for
his GOP presidential aspirations. But Republican George W. Bush, an
astute student of politics even before his high school election as
chief cheerleader, could talk throughout his 1999-2000 campaign about
education and compassion to reach moderates while still emphasizing
tax cuts for his base. Or consider Francois Mitterrand, the socialist
French president in the 1980s who nationalized industry and, when it
was clearly failing, appointed the hard-right conservative Jacques
Chirac as premier and gave him full rein. Chirac proceeded to rapidly
privatize industry and within two years erase the need for himself
while correcting Mitterrand's mistakes for Mitterrand. As that other
noted Fox personality, Homer Simpson, would say, "D'oh!"</TE>
<TE>   Morris also admiringly examines Lincoln's repackaging of himself
from fervent abolitionist to fervent unionist who could accept
limited slavery to realist who would free slaves if it would help win
the Civil War. Wilson, on the other hand, failed miserably to push
the League of Nations because he never effectively linked its success
or existence to the future of his own nation.</TE>
<TE>   All this can provide historical context for a nation whose
collective political memory might go back to what's-his-name, that
Georgia governor before the movie actor. But you better not be an
idealist reading "Power Plays," and you'd better not think that
anyone on this planet does now or has ever done anything other than
relentlessly pursue power for its own sake. Many voters might see
Lincoln or Truman as doing something because they believed it was
simply right.</TE>
<TE>   To Morris and many of his consulting ilk for hire, doing that
right thing is humorous and naive but just might suggest an opening,
if it polled properly. Issues to them are merely valuable bargaining
chips to offer, withhold and, most of all, maneuver around for
tactical advantage in lining up sufficient segments of voters to win
in the current election cycle. Mini-steps are preferred as political
symbols because there's no end product requiring delivery. Finally
resolving any issue is unwise; it deprives your side of a valuable
tool for the next cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "Power Plays" teaches some interesting political lessons from the
past. But the real insight for most of us in this book is might be
the inadvertent warning window it provides into the wily minds of
professional cynics like Morris who have infiltrated our political
system and now know us so much better than we know ourselves.</TE>

<DH>HOME OF THE BRAVE , By Allen Say, Houghton Mifflin: 32 pp.,
$17</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>Duane Noriyuki is a staff writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was 36 years old when I learned that my mother played the violin.
It surprised me at first, as I had never considered her particularly
musical. But now that I look back, I recall watching her dance at
ritual of obon  in kimono and obi, moving in concise, repetitive
steps around and around to the music, tilting her head as her eyes
followed the graceful movements of her hands against the nighttime
sky.</LD>
<LD>   She mentioned the violin in a discussion of war. I had asked what
the most difficult thing was to leave behind when she and her family
were forced out of their Yuba City home and imprisoned during World
War II. She said it was her violin, and then described how her
parents, farm laborers, had paid for it in monthly installments and
sold it for almost nothing before stepping onto a bus, then a train
and, eventually, the unfamiliar, barren terrain of Camp Amache in
southern Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, whenever I envision her as a young girl, I see her with
the violin, and in my mind, I hear a mournful song. I heard it again
as I read Allen Say's "Home of the Brave."</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't so bad, my mother said of internment, except for the
wind and cold, the lingering taste of dust. They lived in a hastily
built shack, but the truth was that the house they lived in before
the war was not much better. I never understood how such an
experience could be not so bad. Perhaps it has to do with my mother's
Buddhist faith, which defines the world as a place of suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Shikata ga nai (it cannot be helped). These are my mother's words.
It is a familiar phrase to the 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry
who were imprisoned in 10 camps built in remote areas of the nation's
interior. It is what they said to one another behind barbed wire in
harsh winter and ruthless summer, the slow passage of seasons of war.
Shikata ga nai. How could they not say more?</TE>
<TE>   I would not have expected that a book for children would provide a
truer meaning of the phrase. Say, the son of a Korean father and
Japanese American mother, wrote "Home of the Brave" after attending a
retrospective of his work two years ago at the Japanese American
National Museum in Little Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   While at the museum, Say, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal for
"Grandfather's Journey," was also entranced by "Common Ground: The
Heart of Community," an ongoing exhibition about the history of
Japanese Americans, including photos and artifacts from internment
camps. "I stared and listened," he writes in the epilogue. "And what
I saw and heard turned into yet another personal journey. This is
that story."</TE>
<TE>   It begins on the bank of a river. The central character, a man of
Japanese ancestry, first listens to the river, then enters it in his
kayak, whereupon he is thrust into rapids, then down a waterfall into
darkness, stripped of vessel, helmet, paddle, life jacket, all means
of controlling destiny.</TE>
<TE>   It is an unlikely beginning to a provocative, dreamlike tale, but
Say's storytelling, when at its best, tends to be wonderfully
unpredictable, well beyond the narrow realm of adults. In "A River
Dream" (1988), he wrote of a street turning into a river. In "The
Sign Painter" (2000), an amusement park with a towering roller
coaster appears like a mirage on an isolated desert butte.</TE>
<TE>   Like those ordered into the camps, the man suddenly has no control
over his journey, and Say takes giant leaps from one page to the
next. From darkness the man discovers a ladder leading to light and,
as he climbs, he reaches a moon-like desert, where he sees two
children alone in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   They are two young girls with name tags hanging from the collars
of their coats. Say's illustration of the girls is based on a 1942
Dorothea Lange photograph of a Hayward-area family. The
black-and-white photograph, capturing lives in turmoil, became one of
the defining images of the internment process.</TE>
<TE>   "'What are you doing here?' he asked.</TE>
<TE>   'Waiting to go home,' the girl answered.</TE>
<TE>   'How did you get here?' he asked.</TE>
<TE>   'From the camp,' she said.</TE>
<TE>   'And where is your home?' he asked.</TE>
<TE>   They did not answer."</TE>
<TE>   The man leads the girls through a dust storm to the camp, where he
discovers traces of his ancestors and more children seeking to return
home. The man also encounters Native American children similarly
displaced and living on a reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Say's use of darkness in the portrayal of childhood innocence is a
poignant interpretation of what children, whatever their culture,
must feel when so tiny and scared and far from where they long to be.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most haunting illustration in the book is of a group
of interned children, "one large body with many eyes." Each wears a
name tag as they stand in front of cold, bare mountains and darkening
sky.</TE>
<TE>   Then, all at once, the small mouths opened.</TE>
<TE>   "Take us home," they chanted.</TE>
<TE>   The children scatter as watchtower guards order them to disperse
and chase them into the darkness with beams of light. The man loses
sight of them and returns to the river, where he falls asleep. When
he awakens he sees Native American children who have found his kayak.
He may leave, but they cannot.</TE>
<TE>   The journey ends prodigiously and poetically as he and the
children watch a cloud of internee name tags magically whisk and
swirl into the sky like paper birds.</TE>
<TE>   "'They went home,' said a child.</TE>
<TE>   'Yes, they went home,' the man said.</TE>
<TE>   And the children nodded."</TE>
<TE>   Young readers or listeners will have questions, foremost among
them: "Why were the camps created?" "Why were reservations created?"
For some, the story may serve as an introduction to social injustice.
I have read the book as both father and son. When I read it to my
4-year-old daughter, who is named after my mother, she commented on
the children.</TE>
<TE>   "They look like me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   I did not address issues of race, the fact that her grandmother
was imprisoned in such a camp. We will reach that point later,
perhaps when she is old enough to read the letter of apology my
mother received from then-President George H.W. Bush in 1990. It was
included with a check for $20,000 in restitution.</TE>
<TE>   "We can never fully right the wrongs of the past," Bush wrote.
"But we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious
injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II."</TE>
<TE>   Say delivers the same message, using different words. My mother,
too, uses different words.</TE>
<TE>   Shikata ga nai. I have a better understanding now. I hear strength
and courage and darkness, a sense of quiet desperation I didn't hear
before. The phrase is written in the confused, fearful eyes of lost
children, regardless of their culture, in the power of an angry river
and the mournful song of a violin. It is written in tears my daughter
has not yet cried.</TE>

<LD>CRADLE TO CRADLE: Remaking the Way We Make Things</LD>
<LD>   By William McDonough and Michael Braungart</LD>
<LD>   North Point Press: 208 pp., $25</LD>
<TE>   "This book is not a tree," write William McDonough and Michael
Braungart. It looks like a book, but it feels different. It's heavier
than the average paperback, the pages are whiter (and resist
dog-earing!), and it is waterproof. "It celebrates its materials
rather than apologizing for them." This book is made from plastic
resins and inorganic fillers. It is recyclable by conventional means.
It can be "circulated infinitely in industrial cycles." It is also
good-looking, stylish even.</TE>
<TE>   "Cradle to Cradle" is about eco-efficiency, designing materials
and products that can be recycled not just once but again and again,
about the intertwining of the biological metabolism on Earth and the
technical (man-made) metabolism. Unlike eco-efficiency models of the
past, McDonough and Braungart are not proposing a return to smaller
scale, no-growth industry. They propose designing industries "to get
bigger and better in a way that replenishes, restores, and nourishes
the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   They call for an end to the "us against nature" design based on
grids and walls and hedges. We have a right to be here, they claim,
without shame. We are part of the ecosystem. As for the "throw-away"
culture, "away has gone away."</TE>
<TE>   But "Cradle to Cradle" is not all philosophy. Braungart is a
chemist, and McDonough is an architect. Reading about their practical
solutions to environmental problems is tremendously inspiring.
McDonough redesigned the Ford factory in Dearborn, Mich., for
example, so that many offices and public spaces were open to the
outdoors and full of light.</TE>
<TE>   He has designed rooftops for buildings in urban areas that are
covered with grass and other plants instead of concrete, serving
drainage and energy-saving purposes. The two are working on finding
substitutes for what are called "X-substances," those chemicals that
resist being broken down and are therefore poisonous and polluting,
like mercury for thermometers and the chemicals used in leather
tanning. The realization is slowly dawning that we have the talent
and creativity and even money to live eco-efficiently. What lingers
after reading "Cradle to Cradle" is frustration that change is not
happening faster.</TE>

<TE>   A DESERT CALLING</TE>
<TE>   Life in a Forbidden Landscape</TE>
<TE>   By Michael A. Mares</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University Press: 320 pp., $29.95</TE>
<TE>   The word "desert" comes from the Latin word desere, meaning to
abandon. Michael A. Mares, a field biologist, has spent decades in
deserts around the world searching for new species.</TE>
<TE>   In "A Desert Calling," he describes the marvelous adaptations some
of these species make to survive in the desert. The kangaroo rat, for
example, uses its forepaws to sift through the sand, uncovering an
average 60 seeds per second, which it buries in various seed banks
that account for the frequent clustering of desert blooms. Mares
describes rodents with such refined hearing that they can detect the
wing beats of owls at night, squirrels that can live without water
for a month and the fierce northern grasshopper mouse, which eats
scorpions and other mice. In Argentina, he studies vampire bats, rats
and peccaries; in Patagonia, penguins and vicuna and lamas; in Iran,
jerboas, cavies and hyrax.</TE>
<TE>   Mares loves the desert and his work; even a day in the Chaco
desert in Argentina, when temperatures reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit
in the shade and birds began dropping from the trees, cannot jar his
deep respect for this environment.</TE>

<TE>   WHERE THE RIVER BENDS, A Memoir</TE>
<TE>   By Barry Raine</TE>
<TE>   Ontario Review: 150 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Barry Raine thinks he behaved like a coward, but any time a person
turns to face a horrible memory like this one, he is proving
hisbravery. In 1981, Raine was 19, a sophomore in college. One night,
he went to a local park in a good neighborhood with his brother Paul
and two friends, Catharine and Alex. They sat on the banks of the
Mississippi. Catharine played guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a man approached them and demanded money. He appeared to
be drugged and behaving strangely. He had a gun. He forced them all
to lie on the ground, raped Catharine and violently kicked Raine and
Paul in the groin. Alex was able to run away and get help. This
terrible event leaves Raine feeling guilty for not "saving" Catharine
and confused about race relations. (The rapist was black and the
victims, white.) Each of the victims comes away with a different set
of hurdles to jump so that life can go on. Catharine's hell is
different from Raine's, but this is his story.</TE>

<DH>NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY GUIDE TO MARINE MAMMALS OF THE

BAJA, By Tamara Eder, Illustrated by Ian Sheldon, Lone Pine Press:

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD ELLIS</AU>
<BD>Richard Ellis is the author of "Aquagenesis: The Origin
and Evolution of Life in the Sea."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before whales achieved their current position as the primary objects
of environmental concern, there was no such thing as a field guide to
whales. There was no need for one, because nobody cared about the
difference between, say, a blue whale and a sperm whale.</LD>
<LD>   Most people, if they thought about whales at all, probably
conjured up an image of the creature that swallows Disney's
Pinocchio: a square-headed thing with too many teeth and a water
fountain spouting from its head. This changed dramatically in the
early 1970s, when the world learned that industrialized whalers were
killing whales all over the world, at a rate that made the Yankee
whalers (such as those portrayed in "Moby-Dick") seem like amateurs.</LD>
<LD>   In order to "save the whales," it was important to show people
what they looked like and, furthermore, that there were significant
differences in size, color and habits among the 70-odd species of
whales, dolphins and porpoises.</LD>
<TE>   In Bermuda in 1970, Katy and Roger Payne made the first recordings
of the haunting songs of humpback whales. Seven years later, Jim
Hudnall's beautiful photographs of Hawaiian humpbacks, the first
photographs ever taken of wild whales underwater, were published in
Audubon magazine. People were then aware that whales were enormously
graceful creatures and, at least in the case of the humpbacks, that
they were singers too.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, I did the illustrations for an Audubon magazine article
called "Vanishing Giants," about the imperiled state of the world's
great whales. Because there were hardly any photographs of living
whales available, I drew and painted all the whale species and, in
the 1980 "Book of Whales," I did more or less the same thing. I did
it again in 1982 for "Dolphins and Porpoises."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, there appeared "The Sierra Club Handbook of Whales and
Dolphins," which contains color paintings by Larry Foster of all the
cetacean species and a lot of black-and-white photographs. The Sierra
Club book is small and designed to be taken aboard ship in your
pocket to facilitate the identification of whales and dolphins at
sea, and the editors assiduously avoided running any illustration
across the gutter, so no matter how big the actual whale is, the
illustration or photo is restricted to one page.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the "National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of
the World," which leaves these publications in the dust and gasping
for air. The jacket shows a common dolphin, undoubtedly chosen
because it is one of the loveliest of the dolphins, with its complex
color pattern and exaggerated dark eyes. (The more familiar
bottlenose dolphin is just plain gray.)</TE>
<TE>   The only name that appears on the cover--front, spine or back--is
that of the illustrator, Pieter Folkens, which is rather curious
because the book was written by four marine mammal experts: Randall
R. Reeves, Brent S. Stewart, Phillip J. Clapham and James A. Powell,
all of whom are respected authorities and are as well known in the
right circles as Folkens. Indeed, Reeves is one of the authors of
"The Sierra Club Handbook of Whales and Dolphins" and also "The
Sierra Club Handbook of Seals and Sirenians," published in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Folkens' illustrations, the book contains 418 color
photographs, all showing the marine mammals in their natural
habitats. (There are four pages of photo credits, identifying some of
the world's foremost nature photographers.) Some photos show the
whales and dolphins at the surface, while others are underwater shots
that show the animals in the medium in which they spend most of their
time.</TE>
<TE>   So it is not surprising that the writing is lucid and engaging,
the science is impeccable, and the photographs are more than worth
the price of admission, some of them so beautiful they can make you
weep, including the photograph of the Yangtze River dolphin, the most
endangered cetacean in the world, down to fewer than 100 individuals.
Look at the spectacular photographs of sperm whales and bowheads,
species that were not photographed until recently. And then gasp in
delight at the photograph of the fluorescent pink humpback dolphin
with its black baby.</TE>
<TE>   There are few pictures of the rare beaked whales--in this book or
anywhere else--so Folkens' excellent illustrations have to suffice.
For the first time outside the scientific literature, there appears a
picture of Longman's Beaked Whale, which has long been a subject of
cetological mystery and controversy. For years, Indopacetus pacificus
was known only from two skeletons, one found in Somalia and the other
in Queensland, Australia. A pair of photographs of unknown beaked
whales was published in Robert Pitman's 2002 article in the
Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, and it was suggested that these might
have been the mysterious beaked whale that Pitman describes as
"perhaps the largest animal left on the planet that has not been
positively identified in the wild."</TE>
<TE>   That there is a large animal, maybe 20 feet long, that until
recently has never been seen by human beings is a humbling thought
and one that should make us question the entire concept of whaling.</TE>
<TE>   The illustration of Longman's Beaked Whale stretches across a
double-page spread, as do all of Folkens' whales and dolphins except,
for some reason, the white-beaked dolphin. The phocids (earless
seals) are usually shown lying horizontally, also cross the spread,
but each otariid (eared seals) resides on a single page, probably
because they are portrayed more upright and, if they were laid out
across two pages, they would fill the spread completely.</TE>
<TE>   What difference does this make? Only that the size range of the
animals covered in this book is enormous--from the 100-foot blue
whale to the 3-foot marine otter--and while it would obviously be
impossible to show them in scale with one another, it is slightly
disconcerting to see that the pan-tropical spotted dolphin (8 feet, 5
inches long) is portrayed at the same size as a right whale (60 feet
in length).</TE>
<TE>   The designers recognized this and solved the problem by opening
each major section ("Eared Seals," "Baleen Whales," "Ocean Dolphins,"
etc.) with a spread that shows all the animals in that section in
scale with one another. For every species there is an illustration,
photographs when available and a box that gives the size at birth,
maximum adult size and weight and life span, when known. Also, each
species description has a little map, showing where the species is
found in the world's oceans or rivers.</TE>
<TE>   As if to show how popular field guides to whales have become, Lone
Pine Press of Renton, Wash., has published Tamara Eder's "Whales and
Other Marine Mammals of California and Baja." It's not really in the
same class as the Audubon guide, and it's full of mistakes, such as
this definition of amphipods: "A group of shrimp-like creatures,
including krill, that are the primary food of many whale species."
Amphipods are not at all shrimp-like, the group doesn't include krill
and only a few whale species eat amphipods. Here's a correct
definition, from the Audubon guide: "Crustaceans belonging to the
order Amphipoda. Amphipods are a food source for some baleen whales."
Eder's is sort of a kids' book: It has a section called "Whale Tales
&amp; Record Breakers," with the answers to such questions as "Which
whale has the most teeth?"</TE>
<TE>   But if you're looking for an accurate, up-to-date, beautifully
designed, well-written guide to whales and other marine mammals, go
for the Folkens but don't forget Reeves, Stewart, Clapham and Powell:
They wrote it.</TE>

<DH>THE NEWS ABOUT THE NEWS: American Journalism in Peril, By
Leonard Downie Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser, Alfred A. Knopf: 294 pp.,
$25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>David Shaw writes about the media for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS News and the Philadelphia Inquirer were once among the crown
jewels of American journalism. Through the early years of television
and well into the 1980s, CBS even styled itself the Tiffany of
American network news organizations: the home of Walter Cronkite, Dan
Rather and Mike Wallace, the broadcast gold standard for serious
national and international news, with bureaus across the globe,
manned by the best correspondents in the business. The Inquirer, from
1975 to 1990, won 17 Pulitzer Prizes for labor-intensive stories on
such important local and national issues as police brutality, massive
deficiencies in the IRS processing of tax returns, a secret Pentagon
budget and corruptions and incompetence in the Philadelphia court
system.</LD>
<LD>   But as Leonard Downie Jr., executive editor of the Washington
Post, and Robert G. Kaiser, a longtime Post reporter and editor, note
in their unsettling new book, "The News About the News: American
Journalism in Peril," although it is extraordinarily difficult to
build a great news organization, it is "tragically easy to
disassemble" one.</LD>
<LD>   "Bad things can happen to good newsrooms," Downie and Kaiser say,
and over the last decade or so, an industrywide push for
ever-increasing profit margins has made many bad things happen at
CBS, at the Inquirer and at other newspapers and television stations
large and small.</LD>
<TE>   Rather and Wallace are hanging on at CBS, but Cronkite retired 20
years ago, at 65, and most of the best correspondents have either
followed him or gone to other networks or other endeavors; most of
the bureaus have been shut, and CBS is now "the least ambitious of
the three networks," Downie and Kaiser say.</TE>
<TE>   At the Inquirer, top editors and reporters have quit in alarming
numbers, frustrated and enraged by repeated cutbacks in staff and
news space dictated by the profit demands and budget-cutting of its
parent company, Knight Ridder.</TE>
<TE>   "Most American corporations would be thrilled with a 10 percent
profit margin," Downie and Kaiser write, "but most newspaper
proprietors consider a 15 to 20 percent profit from their monopoly
businesses a minimal sign of good health." Many insist on 25% to 30%
or more.</TE>
<TE>   Those margins can be difficult to achieve without damaging the
news-gathering effort, even in good economic times. In bad times,
when advertising revenue plummets--as it did in the early 1990s and
as it has done even more precipitously during the last 16 months or
so--it is virtually impossible to have both high profit margins and
high journalistic quality. But having repeatedly promised Wall Street
bigger and bigger profit margins, the media moguls say they must
fulfill those promises or risk losing the big institutional investors
whose defections can send stock prices into a nose dive.</TE>
<TE>   In a shortsighted effort to avoid that, most newspapers "have
shrunk their reporting staffs, along with the space they devote to
news, to increase their owners' profits," Downie and Kaiser say.
"Most owners and publishers have forced their editors to focus more
on the bottom line than on good journalism. Papers have tried to
attract readers and advertisers with light features and stories that
please advertisers ... and by de-emphasizing serious reporting on
business, government, the country and the world."</TE>
<TE>   The expectations and recommendations of Wall Street stock analysts
have become more important to today's press barons than debates in
Congress and famine or genocide abroad, so in an attempt to retain or
regain an increasingly fragmented audience, they've presided over the
tabloidization and celebrification of their news organizations. It's
all O.J. or all Princess Di or all Monica Lewinsky or all Gary Condit
all the time.</TE>
<TE>   Downie and Kaiser make clear that they are exempting the Post--as
well as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal--from their
scathing indictment of contemporary journalism. At those three
papers, they say, the news staffs have "never been more talented, and
their journalism ... never been more ambitious."</TE>
<TE>   Downie and Kaiser also praise the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas
Morning News, and they cite significant recent improvements in the
Portland Oregonian, Raleigh News &amp; Observer and New Orleans
Times-Picayune.</TE>
<TE>   "America's very best newspapers," they say, "all have made
handsome profits, and have steadily broadened the scope and improved
the quality of their news coverage." So why, they ask, haven't more
owners of news organizations noticed this and acted accordingly?
Instead of dumbing down their content in an effort to regain readers,
why haven't they made their newspapers better--more comprehensive,
more authoritative, more concerned with the important issues of the
day, at home and abroad? Why is it that "none of the fashionable
experiments of the eighties and nineties to try to win new readers
for papers included increasing the emphasis on foreign or national
news"? Downie and Kaiser ask. Why haven't the leaders of today's
media conglomerates realized that high-quality journalism can lead
to--rather than undermine--significant profits?</TE>
<TE>   Why indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Downie and Kaiser don't directly answer those
questions. Nor do they address another equally interesting set of
questions. Consider these facts: The audience for the three evening
network news programs in this country plummeted 40% from 1981 to
2001, even as network executives increasingly supplanted serious news
with audience-friendly technological gimmickry and superficial
news-you-can-use formats. But "[a]ll over Europe," they write, "big
audiences tune into prime-time newscasts, many of them much more
serious and richer in content than any American television news
broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   Ninety pages later, Downie and Kaiser drop a similar--and
similarly intriguing--factoid: Surveys, they say, show a "steadily
declining number of Americans who said they 'enjoy keeping up with
the news.' ... Comparative surveys showed that Americans were, on
average, much less knowledgeable about current affairs than the
Germans, French or British, for example."</TE>
<TE>   Again, the obvious question: Why? Is it something intrinsic to
their (and our) culture(s)? But American journalists are fond of
saying that we have the best, fairest and freest news organizations
in the world, and our news organizations certainly do have the most
freedom from overt government censorship; our 20th century tradition
of objectivity rather than blatant partisanship has certainly led to
a more evenhanded approach to the news than that practiced in many
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   But what have we done with our freedom and our fairness? Is it
possible that news organizations in Germany, Britain and France--to
use Downie and Kaiser's examples--have helped create and nurture an
appetite for serious news while most of the oh-so-free-and-fair news
organizations in this country have been--to use one of the authors'
favorite words--"pandering" to the basest instincts and lowest common
denominator in their audience, thus depressing a lively interest in
substantive news by emphasizing celebrities, scandal and
sensationalism in a headlong rush for short-term profits?</TE>
<TE>   Downie and Kaiser don't examine this issue or its implications.
But they have written a valuable and alarming book nonetheless. They
give specific example after specific example of newspapers'
sacrificing quality for profitability. They go inside WRC-TV in
Washington to illustrate the pressures and tensions inherent in local
TV news (singling out Los Angeles as "America's capital of tabloid
TV" along the way). And they report the discouraging--and
discouraged--observations of anchors Rather at CBS, Peter Jennings at
ABC and Tom Brokaw at NBC, which ultimately paint a bleaker picture
of the evolution-cum-decline of network news than do the authors' own
words.</TE>
<TE>   Assignments at CBS, Rather says, used to be made "strictly and
entirely on the basis of, 'Do we think this is important enough
and/or interesting enough to cover?' Nobody said, 'Well, it costs too
much and we can't afford that.'" But profits, which were mentioned
"once a year" when he took over the anchor chair in 1981, are now
talked about "at least every day and most days more than once," and
those discussions inevitably lead to ignoring certain stories that
should be covered.</TE>
<TE>   "The News About the News" is not unrelievedly depressing. The
authors do point out that news organizations across the country have
provided superb and conscientious coverage of the events of Sept. 11
and their aftermath and that newspaper sales and network news
audiences have grown substantially as a result. Moreover, they say,
anxiety about the Internet's replacing newspapers is likely to prove
as unfounded as were earlier fears about television's replacing
newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Television has replaced newspapers as the source of news for most
people, but in the process, television has made the better newspapers
even better. It's forced them to work harder, to give readers not
just the news but the how and the why of the news, to provide the
depth and context and perspective that television cannot--or will
not--provide.</TE>
<TE>   So far, many newspapers--and many television stations--have
reacted differently to the Internet. They've tried to compete with
the Internet on its terms, racing into print or on the air with
unconfirmed reports that often prove inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   Will that change as the Internet continues to evolve and as
traditional news organization learn to adapt to its challenge? Will
the newfound gravitas that emerged in the aftermath of Sept. 11
continue even as the images of that horrible day begin to fade from
memory?</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to answer either of those questions definitively.
But Downie and Kaiser are certainly right when they speak of the
"obvious and palpable" benefits to our society of a return to more
serious news coverage and more rigorous news values. "The United
States will be a better place," they say, "if its citizens can get
from the news what they need to know to govern themselves effectively
and improve their lives."</TE>

<DH>REAL TIME: Stories and a Reminiscence, By Amit Chaudhuri,
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 192 pp., $21</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHASHI THAROOR</AU>
<BD>Shashi Tharoor is the author of "The Great Indian
Novel" and, most recently, of the novel "Riot."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the world of letters has begun paying more attention of late to
Indian writing in English, the time has certainly come to pay tribute
to its astonishing diversity. Gone are the days when Indian novelists
could be lumped together as "Midnight's Children," heirs to Salman
Rushdie's triumphant insertion of the larger-than-life histories and
myths of the subcontinent into the canon of English literature.</LD>
<LD>   Now they paint on a broader canvas, or on several, with an output
ranging from sly comedies of manners to rodomontade reinventions of
history, from the soaring fantasies of magical realism to the
meticulously observed depiction of daily life in contemporary India.</LD>
<LD>   Amit Chaudhuri made that final category virtually his own in three
slender novels, which an American publisher finally issued in one
volume, the well-received "Freedom Song," in 1999. His new
collection, "Real Time," is marked by the same languid love of detail
and absence of drama.</LD>
<TE>   The book's subtitle, "Stories and a Reminiscence," is slightly
misleading. Many of the pieces in this volume are not stories but
ruminations, and the reminiscence appears as 26 pages of blank verse,
charming but literal in its evocation of the author's childhood ("To
write about it in verse/ is to make palpable to myself the
experience"). But "Real Time" nonetheless showcases many of the
strengths and limitations of Chaudhuri's writing.</TE>
<TE>   As one might expect, several of the author's tales are not short
stories so much as slices of life, tenderly evoked in abundant
detail. Some are unabashedly autobiographical, and one is a somewhat
vainglorious meditation on the author's celebrity as a writer,
redeemed only by its closing sentence: "There are a few who spit on
me, because they think I am not worthy."</TE>
<TE>   But aside from two whimsically playful reinventions of episodes
from Hindu mythology, "Real Time" is a symphony in one register. It
conjures a middle-class urban Indian world with precise and loving
evocations of place and setting--complete with a litany of
untranslated Bengali words and Indian brand names (Britannia
biscuits, Larsen &amp; Toubro, Limca).</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhuri's writing is touched by a rare delicacy of description
("the heat had just ebbed into a cloudy, dream-like vacancy") and a
keen sense of the unwritten, unspoken rules that govern human
relationships, particularly in a society in which so much is dictated
by the expectations flowing from age, caste, gender and economic
class.</TE>
<TE>   He understands better than most how people are complicit in their
own elisions. But nothing much happens in Chaudhuri's fiction; in his
books, in a curious reversal of the uncertainty principle, the act of
observation does nothing at all to the objects being observed.</TE>
<TE>   So the writing is key. While it would be unfair to any writer to
speak of a "typical" paragraph, it is useful to consider one that is
fairly representative of Chaudhuri:</TE>
<TE>   "'She just finished her bath,'" said Anjali (who was wearing a
light brown salwaar kameez herself), cheerfully announcing, in medias
res, the progress of an episode that concerned us all. 'Say hello to
Mohon jethu and Romola mashi. Is it jethu or kaku?' she asked,
looking at me, distracted. She looked pretty after the bath that she
herself had had, and the brown salwaar kameez was rather lovely. I
looked at her and gave her a smile of recognition you sometimes give
someone with whom you spend almost every hour of the day."</TE>
<TE>   There, in five sentences, is the distilled essence of Chaudhuri:
the patience with details so unremarkable that other writers might
not have deigned to notice them; the consciousness of the importance
of precisely delineating relationships ("jethu" and "kaku" are
Bengali designations for uncles older and younger, respectively, than
one's father); the simple innocence of the narrator's use of
language, which masks a deeper insight into the nature of human
feeling. This kind of writing will move some and exasperate others;
in this collection of stories, both reactions are unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   Is a gift for observation and empathy enough in a writer of
fiction? In the title story, about a couple who go to a wake for a
young woman who committed suicide by throwing herself off her
parents' balcony, there is an unsatisfying sense of possibilities
raised and not explored. The absence of either dramatic tension or
resolution affects most of the stories, some of which, such as "The
Party," are delightful vignettes but little more. A couple of the
pieces appear to have been tossed off rather lightly and do not seem
ready to be anthologized.</TE>
<TE>   Chaudhuri's insights are often interesting, but they are sometimes
spelled out in an over-expository fashion, so that in some cases the
explanation becomes the essence of the story, as it does in "The Old
Masters," whose last two sentences sum up the point for the reader
with an explicitness rendered all the more curious by the author's
refusal to even hint at the purpose of some of his other pensees.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no doubt about Chaudhuri's intelligence or
seriousness of intent. Many of the stories are elaborate tributes to
literacy itself, that striking product of the miscegenation of
British words and Indian sensibilities which found its first and most
passionate welcome in the author's native Calcutta. Names of writers
and titles of books proliferate on these pages:Chaudhuri depicts a
world peopled by Bengali intellectuals whose "first question ... in
an English accent tempered by the modulations of Bengali speech" is
"Are you profoundly influenced by Eliot?"</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere there is a lovely image of two children, one educated in
Bengali, the other in English, reading side by side, companionably
sharing "worlds that could not be translated into each other."</TE>
<TE>   That is the true measure of Chaudhuri's place in the Indian
literary firmament. As he writes of one of his characters, "Calcutta
is his universe; like a dewdrop, it holds within it the light and
colours of the entire world." "Real Time" reveals a genuine talent
performing in a minor key.</TE>

<LD>Question: Why did you write this book?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: During the retrospective show of my work at the Japanese
American National Museum in Los Angeles, I had the opportunity to see
its exhibition of the World War II internment camps in the United
States. Some facts and numbers were familiar to me--more than 120,000
Japanese Americans interned in 10 camps in six Western states--but
now the statistics took on a human face and voice. I stared and
listened. And what I saw and heard turned into yet another personal
journey. This is that story.</LD>
<LD>   Q: Do you worry that this subject is too difficult for children?</LD>
<TE>   A:  My handling of this subject is mere intimation of the
nightmare that real children were forced to watch and endure. It's a
tame story in our violent world. I'm a war child myself, so I saw the
war through a child's eyes. My story indicts the adult world because
it's children who suffer most.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What surprised you most as you grappled with this still-raw
chapter of our history?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am surprised that so many people--especially young
people--don't know about this dark chapter of recent American
history.</TE>

<DH>HELL TO PAY, By George P. Pelecanos, Little, Brown: 288
pp., $24.95 BLACK WATER, By T. Jefferson Parker, Hyperion: 384 pp.,
$23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Scott defined the novel as a fictitious narrative accommodated
to the ordinary train of human events, which is why novels, in their
18th and 19th century heyday, were social novels. Then they became
literary novels characterized by form, not content, their primary
virtue being inaccessibility. The major remaining representatives of
old-style novels are detective stories, mysteries and thrillers,
which still tell tales of action "accommodated to the ordinary train
of human events."</LD>
<LD>   George P. Pelecanos does this very well, and his "Hell to Pay" is
a terrific thriller, a rip-roaring read. It is also a mine of
information about cultures and subcultures in our land, specifically
in Washington, D.C., where its action detonates an anthropology of
black, brown and white lore, a topography of investigative
activities, a geology of street and off-the-street crime in
bombed-out-looking venues where handguns are snagged as easily as
milk, where two out of three murders go unsolved, where politicians
can be bought and sold as easily as T-shirts featuring
computer-generated photographs of murder victims.</LD>
<TE>   That's the least we expect from a master of mayhem. The sociology
of consumerism is thrown in as an extra. At the top of current
comforts figures our long-standing addiction to cool hoopties like
the Audi S4 and snazzy BMWs. We also get a product placement guide:
Heineken, Bud, marijuana, Ecstasy, New Balance, a Canon AE1 camera
with a digital zoom, Yamaha speakers, a People Finder browser (a
database of Westlaw) and, of course, canned music.</TE>
<TE>   It may not come as breaking news, but, in the popularity stakes,
CD culture has overtaken car culture. Soul, gospel, slow jam, jazz,
rock, rap, bebop, hip-hop and the rest are cited every sixth or
seventh page, sometimes more than once. They mark not race or class
but generation, not good or bad but young or old, and people grow old
fast these days.</TE>
<TE>   Beside such stage-setting, plot comes as an afterthought. Yet the
plot too is intricate, fast-cut, fast-moving, compelling and
perfectly satisfying. It concerns a passel of investigators hunting
first a runaway teenager, then some evasive killers who demonstrate
that small-time bad guys can be just as bad as big-time bad guys,
although tawdrier. All the time the investigators (that is, the good
guys) try to keep their anger in check, their violence in neutral and
to remember that there is room for decency, love, friendship and, in
the end, salvation, even in D.C. That's what one wants to think, and
perhaps it's true. Even if not, the voice of Pelecanos--raspy,
brutal, vivid, moving--is one not to forget.</TE>
<TE>   Each day is the first day of the end of your life. For pretty Gwen
Wildcraft in T. Jefferson Parker's "Black Water," her 26th birthday
proves just that. For Gwen's husband, Archie, an Orange County
Sheriff's deputy, it takes a bit longer. Detective Sgt. Merci Rayborn
investigates. A year before, Merci arrested a fellow deputy for a
murder of which he was innocent. Now she faces the apparent corpse of
another cop and that of his wife in what looks like a murder-suicide.</TE>
<TE>   But Archie, despite a bullet in his head, is still alive; and the
case turns out to be far more complicated than prosecutors panting
for easy scores like to think. Rayborn is determined to get things
right this time, and it turns out that many wrong things and many
wrong people compete for the investigators' attention: Russian
gangsters riding the law in the service of lawlessness; easy money
made from miracle drugs ("Somebody turned twenty grand and snake
poison into two million in less than a year, she figured fraud.");
worst of all, Archie, discombobulated by the bullet in his head but
free and mobile, sets off to catch the creeps who offed his happy
wife and happy life. Merci is all for crime and punishment but by the
proper authorities, whom Archie no longer trusts. It all works out in
the end, though not quite as you might expect. But enough happens in
very few days to fill months of action, and the suspense keeps us
alert for the next thunderbolt.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, meanwhile, writes at the top of his form. He walks us
through scene-of-crime procedures and through the uncertainties left
standing when they are done. He juggles skeins of emotions (if you
don't like sentiment, introspection and reflectiveness, this is not
your kind of book) and lets them make sense even when they don't. And
he never forgets that, as his namesake, Thomas Jefferson, almost
said, the reader's attention must be refreshed from time to time with
the blood of vics and perps. "It is its natural manure."</TE>

<DH>SPIES, A Novel , By Michael Frayn, Metropolitan Books: 264
pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD ZIMLER</AU>
<BD>Richard Zimler is the author of "The Angelic Darkness"
and "The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making a story out of the past may be the best chance we have of
putting it into a sensible order, complete with causes, patterns and
consequences--an order that can, depending on our storytelling
skills, help orient us in the present. To novelists, this often means
returning to childhood to explore those wonderful, tender and cruel
moments that started us on the path to ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   "Spies" opens with Londoner Stephen Wheatley returning home after
an absence of 50 years to the quiet neighborhood where he lived
during World War II, when the threat of German bombing prompted a
diffident and troubled young boy to spend his days imagining
dangerous and heroic adventures. A mysterious floral scent draws him
back, and this shifting borderline between smell and memory is
something that Michael Frayn explores throughout the novel.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen's reminiscences soon turn to his only childhood friend,
Keith, who conceives and directs their adventures together; wherever
Keith leads, our narrator warily follows. Stephen also ends up paying
the price for their mischief, giving their relationship a sadistic
edge, especially as Keith shows no interest in the troubles that
Stephen encounters with adults or even any sympathy for his emotional
conflicts.</LD>
<TE>   It's a promising start, particularly for readers interested in the
great hidden lives of children, except that Frayn soon makes it clear
that he prefers to use his keen powers of observation to
painstakingly portray everything from toys to furniture rather than
to explore the inner lives of his two central characters. It's as if
he's hoping that we'll get to know them--and care about their
escapades--from what their houses look like.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "Spies" seems about to take off when Stephen tells
us that Keith pronounced "six simple words" that immediately turned
their world inside out, but 20 more pages of physical description and
characterizations of peripheral characters follow. What was meant to
be suspenseful ends up as artificial and irritating; we are only too
aware that the author is making us wait to find out what dramatic
line changed their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Keith eventually suggests that someone from one of their families
has betrayed England's war effort, and the rest of the novel follows
the two incipient spies as they stealthily investigate this
possibility. Intriguingly, the clues they soon turn up prompt them to
begin to believe their own construct. Simple scribblings become coded
messages, and neighborhood outings made by their parents become
missions coordinated by enemy strategists. Their small world becomes
fraught with second meanings.</TE>
<TE>   The most engaging parts of the book offer us a close look at
Stephen's different layers of anxiety and fear--at the possibility of
being caught by those being spied on, at finding clues seeming to
confirm that there's a secret agent in their midst, at failing to
fulfill his cruel friend's expectations of him. These emotions ought
to have become the driving force of the novel, but again and again
the author's intrusive descriptions--and Proustian observations about
memory--take all urgency and delight from his tale.</TE>
<TE>   Frayn's characterization of Stephen's memory also becomes more and
more implausible, useful mainly so that the author can say something
about the act and art of narrative. Stephen remembers the most minute
details about room decor, facial expressions and clothing, but he
cannot recall the key moments in that summer's adventure--what he
said during a confrontation with Keith's mother, for instance, or
when it was that a policeman arrived at a possible crime scene. It's
meant to be a comment on the unreliability of narrative and memory,
but it ends up making Stephen an insincere and unsympathetic
storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   The ending is a disappointment. In an effort to tie up the loose
ends he's left over the previous 250 pages, the author resorts to
sleight-of-hand revelations reminiscent of a 1940s crime novel, in
which, for example, the private eye concludes that the Japanese
princess was really a Korean transvestite and her fan a treasure map.
It's unnecessary because anyone interested enough in the emotions of
a boy in wartime London to buy this book isn't going to care whether
there's a clever surprise ending that ties everything up in a neat
little package.</TE>
<TE>   If only Frayn had had more confidence in us--that we don't need
photographic inventories of living rooms or mysteries strung out over
several chapters to keep us turning the pages of an insightful story.
Indeed, if the most simply told and convincing parts of "Spies" were
tied together, they would undoubtedly make a very compelling and
disturbing 120-page novella.</TE>

<LD>It is 6 a.m. in Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   Reiko Sudo, director and chief designer for one of Japan's leading
fabric innovators, NUNO Studio, has finally found time to return a
call. With an 8-year-old son at home and nonstop demands at the
office, the wee hours of the morning are her own, uninterrupted time,
and she is awake, though slightly jetlagged after returning from a
business trip to the United States the day before. With a small laugh
she says, "My most creative time is between 2:30 and 6 in the
morning."</LD>
<LD>   Starting today, some of the fruits of that creative drive will be
on display in "Tradition and Innovation: Contemporary Textiles from
the NUNO Studio, Tokyo" at the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural
History. The show features a selection of the remarkable textiles
that have put her company on the A-list of craft and fashion
cognoscenti--fabrics with metallic coatings, flocked paper, puckered
and ripped surfaces, or simply patterns that are at once familiar and
richly mysterious. In the latter category are designs that have been
made by such surprisingly humble techniques as burning with gas jets
or spray-painting.</LD>
<TE>   In the U.S., NUNO is best known through group museum exhibitions,
such as 1990's "Color, Light, Surface" at the Cooper-Hewitt National
Design Museum in New York and 1997's "Structure and Surface:
Contemporary Japanese Textile Designs" at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York. But the current show, organized by the University Art
Museum at UC Santa Barbara, focuses solely on her studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the inherent beauty of the fabrics themselves--not on the
body but as art--is why they've been so exhibited by museums," says
Marla Berns, director of the Fowler, who was director of the
University Art Museum when the show was conceived. "The techniques
they've used to achieve these results are also really interesting."</TE>
<TE>   There are certainly other fabric designers in Japan, says guest
curator Lynn Gibor, a frequent visitor to that country, "but I think
NUNO is the most influential and I'm inclined to say the most
innovative."</TE>
<TE>   NUNO (which means "fabric" in Japanese) was co-founded by Sudo and
Junichi Arai, a textile designer, in 1984. At the time, it was a
small workshop, and Sudo did everything from design to sales and
distribution. Three years later, when Arai left the company, Sudo
took the helm. "That was the starting point for me," she says.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of the Musashino Art University in Tokyo, Sudo, now 48,
recalls studying a variety of media at school, including clay, metal,
wood, plastic and textile. "They wanted you to try everything," she
says. "Then at the end of the second year, you got to choose the
medium that best expressed your thoughts." Sudo chose textile and
industrial design.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, she had been inspired by innovations in textile
designs seen in publications and books--including work by
U.S.designer Jack Lenor Larsen as well as work being produced in
Japan. Sudo's initial goal was to make one-off painted kimonos. "But
I realized there was this very expressive way to use fiber," she
says. "It was really more conceptual work."</TE>
<TE>   This was the spirit she brought to NUNO. At the beginning, she had
just two employees, and, she says, "I thought it would be much nicer
that we work together, more like a team." That is how Sudo has run
her enterprise, open to suggestions from all the workers, who also
take part in the subsequent development.</TE>
<TE>   "I have 12 staff members, and everybody has to do
everything--that's the NUNO concept," she says. "Have ideas, help in
[developing] the fabric, packing, even selling. We're still small."
As director, she decides which ideas to pursue and how assignments
are made.</TE>
<TE>   NUNO headquarters are in the upmarket area of Roppongi in Tokyo,
with a retail store next door that sells bolts of NUNO fabrics as
well as a limited selection of ready-made clothing in simple cuts.
(There are nine other outlets throughout Japan.) NUNO also has a
workshop in Kiryu, a traditional textile town two hours north of
Tokyo that has been revived by a renaissance in Japanese fabric arts.
Mass production is farmed out to more than 40 mills all over Japan,
and Sudo is continually on the hunt for mills that can produce
textile to the studio's exacting specifications.</TE>
<TE>   It was perhaps most difficult to find a mill for "Stainless Steel
Gloss," in which polyester fabric is pressed between rollers and then
splatter-plated with powdered chrome, nickel and iron to give it a
metallic sheen. NUNO experimented until it could combine the metals
and the fabric in such a way that the finished product would remain
pliable to the touch. When the studio began developing the fabric in
1989, the team went to an automotive company for help with applying
the metal powders. Later, a textile mill agreed to install the
special equipment necessary to coat the fabric.</TE>
<TE>   NUNO fabrics are unusual not just in their materials, but also in
the way they are woven and treated to create texture and pattern.
Some methods are traditional, such as shibori, or tie-dying.</TE>
<TE>   To create a desired pattern, fabric is pinched, wrapped, knotted
or rolled and then dyed, so that some sections are exposed to color
and others are not. However, NUNO takes everything a step or two
further. In "Bubble Pack," a bulk-crimping technique shrinks the
fabric around the pinched areas, so that they stand up from the rest
of the crimped cloth.</TE>
<TE>   This crimping effect was popularized by the fashion designer Issey
Miyake, who has treated whole garments to the process. In some cases,
NUNO also uses the crimping method alone--as in "Origami Pleat," in
which careful hand-folding is followed by heat pressing, which
creates a triangular, origami-like pattern in the cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Although pleating is not new in Japanese textiles--it is essential
in the creation of hakama, men's traditional baggy pants--the complex
pleating and folding in NUNO fabrics can only be achieved with a 20th
century fiber, polyester, which takes especially well to
heat-pressing. It's not just any polyester, however. Sudo points out
that Japanese polyesters she uses are sometimes as expensive as silk.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned with the character of the material, what we can
do with it," she says, which means NUNO is always looking into new
fibers. For instance, Sudo's team has been considering the
possibilities of a fiber developed recently in the United States.
"Last year we got government money to do research into material made
from corn that is biodegradable."</TE>
<TE>   Making NUNO fabrics, based on craft ideals, tends to be
labor-intensive and often requires handwork. In "Feather Flurries,"
the worker must stop the loom in mid-weave and insert feathers
(peacock and guinea fowl) into pockets that have been formed between
two layers of translucent organdy silk. In "Scrapyard," lengths of
rayon are laid out by hand over rusty iron plates, then left to sit
for up to a week as the rust transfers a reddish-brown mottle to the
cloth. (Similar pieces are also made with rusty barbed wire and
nails.) Sudo is still having trouble finding a mill to produce this
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   The Fowler exhibition features 30 samples of NUNO cloth in a
display by installation designer Mayu Yoshikawa. An entry is created
by lengths of cloth hanging from the ceiling on either side, creating
a passageway that leads to "Scrapyard" and includes the rusty metal
plates used to create it. The next, larger gallery will feature more
samples, along with a short video about their fabrication and an area
where the fabrics may be handled.</TE>
<TE>   With the ongoing development of new fabrics and the desire to
expand markets--on April 12 NUNO opened its newest outlet, in Aoyama,
another area of Tokyo--Sudo will not be able to attend the opening of
the NUNO show here. "Sometimes it's a little chaotic," she admits.</TE>
<TE>   While her attention to craft is profoundly Japanese, Sudo says she
does not consciously adhere to principles of Japanese aesthetics. "Of
course I am Japanese, and I grew up in a very traditional countryside
in Japan--Ibaraki prefecture," she says. "Is there any connection?
Maybe to some kind of wabi sabi?" Wabi sabi refers to a Japanese
ideal that emphasizes simple, austere beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally don't try to be Japanese [in my work]," she says.
"In the past, fabrics helped to reflect the reality of the
era--showing power, family status and so on. People ask me, why do
you keep making new textiles? It's because I care about our time, we
live in the now, and I want to be in the now."</TE>
<TE>   For her, that means using any material and every bit of knowledge
accumulated over the centuries. Organic, man-made, metallic, "high
technology, low technology, we can equally use them [all]," she says.
In the end, though, "some part involves the human hand, and that's
what's interesting."</TE>

<DH>The game's changed, but agent Phil Gersh is still at it
after more than 60 years. Oh, the stories he can tell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES DENNIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his more than 60 years as an agent, Phil Gersh has had a host of
famous clients, among them David Niven, Fredric March, Mary Astor,
Lee J. Cobb, Gloria Grahame, Dorothy McGuire, Zero Mostel and James
Mason. But the agent is perhaps best known for his handling of
Humphrey Bogart in the 1950s, an association that led to some of the
actor's most memorable screen roles.</LD>
<LD>   If the '40s had revealed the tough-guy, existential hero of
"Casablanca" and "The Big Sleep," it was during the '50s that
Bogart's versatility was revealed in such films as "The African
Queen" and "Sabrina." Making that transition wasn't easy, Gersh
reveals with a memory for detail that belies his 90 years.</LD>
<LD>   "Bogey was a very decent guy," Gersh says. "Very loyal. He had the
same lunch every day between films at Mike Romanoff's: two scotch and
sodas, an omelet, French toast, some milk and then, at the end,
coffee and a brandy. In those days, everybody drank.</LD>
<TE>   "This one particular lunch, we didn't have a future commitment for
him. This was after he'd won the Oscar for 'African Queen.' He turned
to me and said: 'Kid, no scripts. You didn't bring any scripts.' I
said, 'Next week, I'll have three scripts for you next week.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bogart shook his head and told Gersh: "You didn't bring any
scripts. Nobody wants me." "The insecurity! You see, those actors
were used to the old studio system and having a contract 40 out of 52
weeks. They'd do four, five pictures a year."</TE>
<TE>   Gersh knows a thing or two about working hard-- he's still at it
every day. He's one of the last links between Hollywood's golden age
and the corporate-owned movie business today. Where agents today
communicate via cell phones and Palm Pilots, Gersh is an
old-fashioned hand-holder.</TE>
<TE>   He flourished at a time when movie stars turned up at premieres in
mink coats and gorgeous gowns, when driven producers like Darryl
Zanuck and Sam Goldwyn gambled their studios and life savings to make
the movies they wanted, and talent was swapped at all-night card
games among producers and agents like Myron Selznick, Leland Hayward
and Charles Feldman, who were as colorful as their more famous
clients.</TE>
<TE>   "You can set your watch by him going by on his way to work every
day," says actor-director Richard Benjamin, a Gersh client who lives
down the street from the agent and his wife of 57 years, Beatrice.
(The couple are well-respected art collectors and donated a
significant part of their collection to the Museum of Contemporary
Art in 1989.)</TE>
<TE>   Gersh hasn't lost his verve for the business--or his bluntness in
assessing the current Hollywood scene. "There's no executive control
in the movie business anymore," says the wiry, silver-haired Gersh,
whose voice still carries the cadence of his native New York. He's in
the Beverly Hills office of the Gersh Agency, which he runs with
Leslie Siebert and his sons Robert and David. Today, the Gersh
offices in Beverly Hills and New York employ 50 agents. The present
client list includes Tobey Maguire, David Schwimmer, Marcia Gay
Harden, Deborah Messing, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Arquette, Seann
William Scott, David Arquette and Catherine Keener.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil still works as an agent," Siebert says. "But most important,
he's our leader, the one we turn to for advice and feedback for what
we're doing with the company."</TE>
<TE>   In the past 50 years, where his contemporaries were swallowed up
by bigger agencies or simply closed their doors, how has Gersh
managed to survive and thrive?</TE>
<TE>   "He's very smart about the business," Siebert says. "He knows how
to adapt to it. People like myself and his sons understand today's
business and keep it up to speed. He's had many offers to buy him
out. But this business is his passion, his life. He'll never give it
up."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there have been some failures along the way. Kirk
Douglas fired Gersh when the actor failed to win the title role in
the 1959 epic "Ben-Hur," despite the agent's campaign to win him the
part, which went to Charlton Heston. But Gersh survived in the often
brutal world of Hollywood agents.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Baum, a longtime agent and one of the founders of Creative
Artists Agency, has known Gersh for years and feels the key to his
long-lasting success is "his honesty, decency and hard work."
DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg calls Gersh "an unsung hero.
He's a man of great taste, an extraordinary quality to have as an
agent."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent visit to his office, Gersh shakes hands with a
vise-like grip. It's casual Friday and Gersh is dressed in a green
sports shirt and sharp-looking trousers.</TE>
<TE>   "The actors now can call all the shots in terms of compensation,
when they want to start the picture, even who the below-the-line
people should be," says Gersh, who clearly remembers when things were
very different.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1930s, Gersh came to Los Angeles from New York to
attend UCLA. After graduation, he went to work for his
brother-in-law, agent Sam Jaffe, for $15 a week in the mail room of
his agency. "But I didn't stay there long," says Gersh, his green
eyes twinkling. "I felt it wasn't that big an agency."</TE>
<TE>   His first client was Mark Robson, an old fraternity brother from
UCLA. Robson had been an editor at RKO, who made the move up to
directing. Through Robson, Gersh met and signed some other young
directors at the studio: Robert Wise, Richard Fleischer and Joseph
Losey. "I got lucky with them," Gersh says, "and got a reputation for
representing hot, young directors."</TE>
<TE>   When Ray Stark (an agent at that time who would later become a
producer) left Charles Feldman's rival agency, Famous Artists, Gersh
replaced him and persuaded Feldman to run the two agencies as a
co-venture. Years later, Gersh bought out the Jaffe Agency partners
and changed the name to the Phil Gersh Agency.</TE>
<TE>   He enjoys talking about the old days, when deals were made on golf
courses and tennis courts, not corporate boardrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to play tennis at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club," Gersh
recalls. "Billy Wilder used to play there. I knew him quite well. He
was starting 'Sabrina' at Paramount and I slipped a script to Bogey
without Billy knowing. I wanted to get him [Bogart] away from
stick-em-up Louie with the gun [roles]. Billy phoned and said: 'Phil,
you're a good tennis player but you don't know nothing about
casting.'"</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, after Cary Grant turned down the role of Linus
Larrabee, Wilder phoned Gersh and asked him to arrange a meeting with
Bogart. They met at Bogart's house. Wilder brought his co-author,
Ernest Lehman (later to became another Gersh client). They sat and
drank for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   "He [Bogart] could hold his liquor. And if somebody didn't drink,
he suspected that person." (Asked how he managed to keep up with so
many renowned drinkers, Gersh confesses that he pretended to drink
much of the time.) Finally, Bogart told Wilder: "If you shake hands
and say you're going to take good care of me, I'll do the picture."</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of shooting, a very unhappy Bogart phoned his
agent late in the day and told him to get over to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "Now bear in mind, William Holden and Audrey Hepburn [the two
other stars of 'Sabrina'] are very good friends of Billy's," Gersh
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Bogart's the outsider. So I drove over to Paramount and Bogey
said to me, 'I don't have to put my hairpiece on. Every shot is from
the back of my head.'" Gersh assured Bogart he'd straighten matters
out. He took Wilder aside on the set and told him to get another
actor for Linus. Gersh's unhappy client was going home and taking his
hairpiece with him.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder called Gersh and promised him things would be different.
"He started giving him front shots," Gersh says, smiling, still
pleased at the happy resolution half a century later. "And Bogey had
to put on his hairpiece."</TE>
<TE>   With another '50s classic, William Wyler's "The Desperate Hours,"
Gersh had to intervene again on Bogart's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "Bogey called Spencer Tracy from my office--they were buddies--and
said, 'Spence, let's do one together. You can have first billing.
It'll be fun.' Tracy hemmed and hawed and finally didn't do it. Gersh
put another of his clients, Fredric March, into the role.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh had negotiated a clause in the actors' contracts prohibiting
Bogart and March from working after 6 p.m. One afternoon, an unhappy
Bogart phoned his agent and summoned him to Paramount. Gersh arrived
at 5:30 and discovered Bogart running up and down stairs on the set
of the house where his escaped-convict character was holding March
and his family hostage.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh says Wyler had trouble telling actors what he wanted. At
first Wyler told Bogart he was going too fast up the stairs, then too
slowly, then "too phony." Bogart got angry and threatened to go home.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh cautioned his client not to walk out before his contractual
quitting time. Instead, he took Wyler aside and told him Bogart was
having trouble with how fast the director wanted him to go up the
stairs. Gersh suggested Wyler demonstrate the run for the actor.</TE>
<TE>   Wyler paused, then shouted out to the crew: "It's a wrap."</TE>
<TE>   By the next year, Bogart was dying of cancer. Gersh remembers his
last visit to the actor's home.</TE>
<TE>   "He weighed 90 pounds," Gersh recalls. "They had to bring him
downstairs in the dumbwaiter. But when he saw me, he asked, 'Where
are the scripts, kid?' I told him they were out in the car. With
offers attached."</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime client was David Niven. Gersh worked on producer
Mike Todd for six months to get Niven the role of Phileas Fogg in
"Around the World in 80 Days." Todd had wanted Cary Grant, but when
he proved unavailable, Niven--who had been languishing in bad movies
and TV guest spots--got the role. Following this resurrection of
Niven's movie career, Gersh got him the "Separate Tables" role of
Major Pollack, the fraudulent, if also sympathetic, war hero and
masher, a huge stretch for the debonair light comedian, which
ultimately won Niven his only Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "So now he was a major star," Gersh says. "We were friends. Had
lunch together. But one night at Jean Simmons' house, Bert Allenberg,
a big agent at William Morris, gave David a sales pitch." Gersh
recalls Niven's reaction: "'How can I leave Phil?' Niven asked.
'Don't worry,' said Allenberg. 'Gersh will get over it.'</TE>
<TE>   "So in front of his business manager--he wouldn't see me alone--he
fired me," Gersh recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is, David called Allenberg on Wednesday and his
secretary was in tears. 'Mr. Allenberg was at Danny Kaye's last
night. He had a major stroke, and he's dead.' I said to myself, 'God
punished him.'"</TE>
<TE>   Niven never returned to Gersh and, years later, he described the
incident at his own expense in the second volume of his memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh is asked if he ever takes clients back after they leave him.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him the story about Lauren Bacall wanting to come back,"
says Siebert, who clearly loves this anecdote.</TE>
<TE>   Gersh considers the story, then tells her: "Nah. She's still
alive." And so is Phil Gersh.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not retiring. Once you turn it off," says Gersh, tapping the
side of his head, "you're dead. I exercise and I have my vodka. And I
have a good time."</TE>

<HD>The New Apples of Dad's Eye?</HD>
<DH>After learning her traditional father is hooked on 'Sex and
the City,' a daughter examines their relationship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three thousand miles away, not far from the aqua waters of the
Atlantic, lives a 64-year-old Cuban man who is getting to know his
daughter in an unconventional way.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the man, who has lived his life surrounded by women
(five sisters, a wife, two daughters and two granddaughters), has
found the time to wrap himself up in the lives of four new women. I
imagine this must have occurred accidentally, probably because he
failed to change the channel after his favorite show, "The Sopranos."
What is unthinkable, even now that I've had time to digest it, is
that my dad has gotten hooked on "Sex and the City," a show in which
the main character is a 35-year-old writer chronicling her quest for
the One.</LD>
<LD>   In episode after episode of the HBO series, Carrie Bradshaw
(played by Sarah Jessica Parker) and her three girlfriends leave
little to the imagination. They discuss their sex lives; they feel
empowered when they can have sex "like a man"--that is, without
emotional attachment. Yet they look for lasting love.</LD>
<TE>   Simply put, nothing in Carrie's Manhattan world remotely matches
my dad's Miami lifestyle. My father, Republican and Catholic, is as
old-fashioned as they come. No one has taught me more about
commitment and devotion. In his world, family comes first. It is from
observing the way his wife and daughters have always been the
priority that I have come to expect the same from my potential
partners.</TE>
<TE>   These are values I cherish, but it wasn't always easy. Growing up
in the United States meant being exposed to modern ideas,
individualistic ideals and huge dreams--things that often clashed
with the conservative mores of my Cuban relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Not that my father raised us to be submissive housewives.
Education is a top priority in Cuban culture. I recall many
conversations in which my father said it was important for us to earn
college degrees so we would never have to depend on a man.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing how my life is turning out, I have often wondered if he was
clairvoyant--if somehow he knew his younger daughter was setting out
on a path that would require her to be self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me back to my father's new favorite show. Single
women in their 30s all over the country tune in to "Sex and the City"
because it so precisely captures what it's like to be a strong,
independent, self-confident woman in today's America. We relate to
one or all of the women, contemplating while we watch, "Which one am
I?"</TE>
<TE>   There's even a "Sex and the City" Fabulon Quiz on the Web
(www.hbo.com/gl/quiz1.swf) to help women sort out which character
they most resemble: Samantha (Kim Cattrall), the carefree public
relations diva who takes pride in sleeping with men all over
Manhattan without falling in love with them; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon),
the tough, jaded attorney who doesn't believe in love; Charlotte
(Kristin Davis), the hopeless romantic and conservative art dealer.
Or Carrie Bradshaw, the newspaper columnist whose internal monologues
narrate the show.</TE>
<TE>   I don't live in Manhattan, but L.A. isn't exactly Fantasy Island
when it comes to finding your soul mate. I'm 33; I'm single; I have
many girlfriends in that demographic. We could not live without each
other. I am a clotheshorse. I love shoes. I am a social butterfly.
And I'm a writer. So it's Carrie to whom I can relate the most.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it seems, my father does too.</TE>
<TE>   This came up while I was having a routine telephone conversation
with my mother and he grabbed the other extension. He wanted to know
if the "Sex and the City" season was over. He explained that he
thought he missed the season finale, but when I uncomfortably assured
him he had seen it, he was relieved and hung up.</TE>
<TE>   As my mother continued her story, that last episode of the HBO
show ran through my mind. Dios mio! My father was watching when
Samantha caught her boyfriend in a graphic oral sex moment with
another woman. My father was watching when Charlotte went after her
first post-divorce sexual partner. My father was watching when
Miranda had her baby with the man she does not plan to marry by her
side. And my father was watching as Carrie contemplated having sex
with her ex-boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   How did this happen? I didn't think my father was the kind of man
who could handle--much less enjoy--this type of TV program.
"Pornography!" I can hear him saying. Yet he is watching. The same
man who taught his daughters to resist sexual pressure in high school
by saying "you do not want to be the ball that gets tossed around
from guy to guy in your school" is using Carrie and company as a
window into my world.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I've even discussed this with Papi--the man who was
stunned into a few days of silence when my sister, 27 and married for
five years, announced she was pregnant, thereby revealing that, yes,
she was having sex.</TE>
<TE>   I haven't worked up the nerve to ask what he sees in Carrie. He
and I have talked a lot about marriage and commitment this past year,
about the way two people with joined hearts and minds can complement
each other and create one fulfilling life for both.</TE>
<TE>   Many men no doubt watch the show for the sex, seeking to
understand what women want and how they want it. I don't believe my
father is one of them. I think he tunes in because Carrie and her
friends represent the conundrum that is completely foreign to a man
who has loved the same woman since he was 15: Why is finding love
suddenly so challenging?</TE>
<TE>   This is not a topic that comes up frequently or easily for either
of us. Many fathers and daughters feel awkward discussing sex. Our
uneasiness is about so much more. He doesn't want to torment me with
warnings of a ticking clock or, worse, remind me of the pain I've
overcome.</TE>
<TE>   More important, I think, he doesn't want to reveal his pain. A man
who lost everything to Communism, spent 18 months in prison because
of his politics and re-created his life in a foreign land at 30
doesn't tend to dwell on his emotions--especially if he thinks his
feelings might hurt someone else. So we read between the lines.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, every once in a while this past year, he has shared a few
questions that nag him: Why has it been so hard for his younger
daughter and many of her friends to find good men? Why do seemingly
kind men come and go so quickly? Doesn't anyone value commitment
anymore? Has the world changed that much?</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, it has. In my father's day, gender roles were defined. The
focus for couples was more on "we" than on "me." He was raised by a
dedicated and committed man who lived for his wife and seven
children. Women did not intimidate men, and men did not run from the
women who cared about them.</TE>
<TE>   These days, education and opportunity have made us believe we
should always be reaching, always striving, never settling.
Relationships are like cars we trade in for the next best model.
Nobody wants to compromise or adjust to make relationships stronger.
Somehow, we've all come to believe that out there, somewhere, is one
person for each of us who will make our dreams come true, without
requiring effort, introspection or internal change.</TE>
<TE>   If this makes little sense to me, what must cross the mind of my
Old World father when he envisions his little girl living alone?
Having him in my life has kept me believing in the immensity of love,
even as his wisdom carried me through the crushing losses of two
special relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it hurts me to know that the man who has loved the same
woman for 49 years is questioning truths he considered absolute. In
typical fashion, he doesn't burden his daughter with such worries.
Instead, my mother says, he turns to the next best thing to find his
answers: Carrie Bradshaw.</TE>

<DH>With their nonconformist music, female Mexican artists have
become a pop force to reckon with.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the list of the top five best-selling Latin artists last year in
the United States, there's only one woman. She's from Mexico, and
she's No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Paulina Rubio, a sexy pop singer with blond hair and fluffy
material, outsold salsa heartthrob Marc Anthony, mariachi monarch
Vicente Fernandez and L.A. banda bad boy Lupillo Rivera, according to
year-end sales reports from SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   Rubio, however, represents only the most visible--and critics
would say, most disposable--faction of female performers who have
emerged as a significant force in Mexico in the past decade or two.
Indeed, market-savvy artists such as Rubio and Thalia, another
high-gloss commercial creation, tend to steal the spotlight from a
swelling movement of lesser-known but more challenging artists who
haven't drawn mass-media attention.</LD>
<TE>   Chances are you won't see Mexico's most rewarding female artists
on Spanish-language television or hear them on commercial radio. They
don't have major-label contracts and only rarely travel here on tour.
But the number of independent female performers making original and
nonconformist music in Mexico is approaching critical mass, according
to fans, promoters and independent labels that have given many of
these alternative artists a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "Women are defining alternative Mexican music today, much the same
way male rock groups like Cafe Tacuba did in the 1980s," says Betto
Arcos, host of "Global Village," a world-music show on Los Angeles
radio station KPFK-FM (90.7). "Their music is different, it's good,
and it needs to be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City-based Opcion Sonica, an independent label founded 15
years ago, has capitalized on the trend with a series of three
compilation albums called "Mexican Divas." The albums focused
attention on Mexico's eclectic roster of female performers working in
styles from medieval chants to electronica, They include top names
such as Ely Guerra and Lila Downs, who got her start on the label.
Downs and Guerra, along with Julieta Venegas, are among the handful
of women who have recently broken away from the alternative pack to
win higher profiles and international followings.</TE>
<TE>   But the diva collections also contain works from a group of
talented women still laboring in relative anonymity south of the
border. They range from the outlandish performance art of Astrid
Hadad to the cosmopolitan jazz vocals of pianist Iraida Noriega to
the hilarious, irreverent cabaret parodies of Liliana Felipe.
Southern California audiences will soon have a chance to see some of
these performers in person for the first time. From Wednesday through
Oct. 24, several artists on the compilations will appear in a series
of monthly concerts titled Mexican Divas Night Live at L.A.'s Mayan
nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has so many female artists nowadays that the diva
collections feature as many as 14 tracks without repeating an artist,
and they keep introducing new talent with every volume. The albums
sparked collaborations by artists who had previously worked on their
own. They include Noriega and singer-songwriter Magos Herrera, who
during their L.A. appearance plan to perform a rare type of
indigenous song from Michoacan called pirecua, which was originally
created for female duet and often combines Spanish and native Indian
tongues.</TE>
<TE>   For the series, "the hope is to try to demystify what Mexican
singers are about," says Arcos, who is helping publicize the events.
"They don't just sing boleros and rancheras. They don't just sing
dance music. We also have women who use their music to make a
statement. In Mexico, women are finally being allowed to do their own
thing rather than being just a token in a man's band."</TE>
<TE>   It may seem odd, at this late feminist stage, that Mexican women
are still obliged to grapple with stereotypes about their place in
society and the music business. But many people still cling to
notions about the subservient female and the dominant male in Mexican
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Even prominent Mexican American writer Richard Rodriguez, in an
interview on National Public Radio's "Fresh Air" this month, helped
reaffirm the myth of Mexican women as passive and long-suffering
martyrs. In Mexico, Rodriguez generalized, men are sentimental about
mothers but cruel toward women, and "casual about their betrayals of
the wife." The Mexican male's main mission, he continued, is to have
sons "who are as dreadful" as their fathers.</TE>
<TE>   Machismo may be alive and well in Mexico, but you'd have to look
high and low to find a modern Mexican woman who would sit still for
it. If you missed that point, you haven't been listening to the voice
of Mexico's female singers.</TE>
<TE>   In Felipe's wickedly satirical "Mala" (Bad), today's spurned and
mistreated woman comes across as outright scary, even in translation.</TE>
<TE>   Bad as censorship, as a hairless garbage mouse/ Bad as misery or a
thief in the house/ Bad as the signature of Santa Anna / Bad as
taking a stick to your nana/ Bad as strychnine, bad as cold soup/ Bad
as a spider, bad and blood-thirsty/ Bad as order and decency.</TE>
<TE>   The song, done as a spoofy ballroom danzon, ends with a flourish
and a twist: "Bad, bad, bad, bad/ But hey, fellas, what a pretty
girl."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has always produced excellent music by fine female artists,
from the lilting tropical boleros of Tona La Negra to the weepy
rancheras of Amalia Mendoza. But it's the tragic figure of Lucha
Reyes (1906-1944), with her raw, gutsy style and revolutionary
persona, who has served as the key inspiration for today's most
daring and provocative performers, including Hadad and Felipe.</TE>
<TE>   Another model for modern divas was Consuelo Velazquez, one of the
first prominent female composers working in what was then an all-male
songwriting club. Her standard "Besame Mucho" is included on
Noriega's beautiful 2001 album "Efecto Mariposa" (The Butterfly
Effect). It's a sultry song of desire and abandon that was considered
scandalous in its day, says Noriega, who admires Velazquez's
determination to compose from the heart as a flesh-and-blood woman.</TE>
<TE>   It all seems tame by today's pop standards in Mexico. Yet the
early work of these female pioneers paved the way for the overt
sexuality of Rubio and the raw lustiness of rocker Alejandra Guzman,
who will be queen of next Sunday's Fiesta Broadway, the annual
festival in downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Most modern female pop performers in Mexico project a strong,
independent image. The problem, some critics say, is that
high-profile stars such as Rubio and Guzman allow their sexuality to
be exploited for commercial gain. The new wave of alternative female
artists, on the other hand, offer more substance than their pop
counterparts. Many write their own songs and arrangements, and play
an instrument.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, these women have coalesced into a definable though
unruly counterculture. They are not joined by ideology, and they
don't share a single genre. They can be either folkloric or
avant-garde. They sing in Spanish or English or even dead medieval
languages, as in the case of singer and researcher Jaramar Soto of
Guadalajara. Some, such as Noriega, resist being tagged as feminists.
Others, like Felipe, identify themselves as lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   What unites them is an underdog spirit of survival as artists,
despite feeling shut out by Mexico's monopolistic music industry.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, the story of pop music for the past 30 years has been
inextricably tied to the story of Televisa, the national TV monopoly
that operated like an old-fashioned political machine. Until
recently, the network had such a tight control on the mass media that
it virtually dictated pop music tastes. Pop stars were created out of
whole cloth by the Televisa hit-making machine. Rubio and Thalia both
emerged in the 1980s from the teen group Timbiriche, manufactured by
the network.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of the Televisa monopoly, musicians saw themselves as
either in or out. And if you were out, says Noriega, you were
nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is not Paulina; the problem is all the people behind
the scenes who put brakes on everybody else," says Noriega, 30, who
started her career at 17. "I'm not saying there should be no
Paulinas. I'm saying it's valid for people to hear us too. There's a
whole lot of artists here in Mexico who are doing very beautiful
work, with a lot of depth, honesty and commitment."</TE>
<TE>   The women of Mexico's contemporary diva movement--including
veterans Cecilia Toussaint and Eugenia Leon--carry on the Lucha Reyes
tradition of boldly asserting themselves as women and artists. They
don't want to sell their looks. They want the public to accept them
as whole women, with ideas and convictions as well as passions.</TE>
<TE>   They had the talent, but until recently they lacked the means to
showcase their creativity. That's been changing in Mexico, with more
labels and more places to play, such as colleges and cultural
centers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our work is to expose this talent and take it as far as it can
go," says musician Ana Ramirez, who runs the L.A. branch of the
Opcion Sonico label along with her husband, Felix Mejorado of local
Spanish rock band Felix and the Katz. "We have to educate the public
that our culture has more to offer, because otherwise nobody will
ever hear about all these jewels."</TE>
<TE>   As exposure increases, so do audiences. Ely Guerra, for example,
sold out a Sunday show at West Hollywood's Key Club following a week
of local appearances earlier this month. Her success was seen as a
sign that Latin music lovers are hungry for pop alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for every public success there are a dozen private setbacks.
Guerra and other alternative artists confess to moments of self-doubt
when they could see no options and find no outlets for their art
within the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us who survived that dark period became stronger," says
the husky-voiced Magos Herrera, whose elegant 2000 album "Orquideas
Susurrantes" (Whispering Orchids) has strong Brazilian and Afro-Cuban
influences. "It was like a test of your vocation.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stuck it out, it was because you really wanted to be a
musician. And so it created somewhat of a cultural elite, artists who
became very demanding of themselves and of each other. It was like
our way of reaffirming our commitment to do the best work we could
do."</TE>

<TE>   Mexico's Alternative Divas</TE>
<TE>   The three volumes of "Mexican Divas" are a good sampler of
Mexico's alternative female artists. Here are other albums by some of
the women who will appear in the "Mexican Divas" concert series in
Los Angeles in upcoming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Some titles may be hard to find, but try Amoeba Music in Hollywood
and Tower outlets. Also, consult the Opcion Sonica label at
www.opcionsonica.com.mx.</TE>
<TE>   Eugenia Leon, "Que Devuelvan," Discos Cabaret. Backed by the tasty
Danzonera Dimas, Leon interprets the biting, satirical, inventive
songs of Liliana Felipe, including the title cut, which demands that
politicians return what they stole, down to the "the pesos and
centavos."</TE>
<TE>   Jaramar, "A Flor de Tierra," Opcion Sonica. A gorgeous, authentic
collection of Latin American roots music in the elegant style of
Jaramar Soto. Fresh takes on standards such as "Malaguena" and such
unusual choices as "Caras Lindas," a Puerto Rican salsa standard done
in a slow-tempo, Afro-Peruvian arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Magos Herrera, "Orquideas Susurrantes/Whispering Orchids," Opcion
Sonica. In this poetic work, the soulful singer-songwriter offers a
blend of song by herself and others, a few tinged with tango and
bossa nova touches.</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia Toussaint, "Cecilia Toussaint," Producciones al Vapor. A
probing, complex set from a pioneer of the new diva movement,
tastefully produced. The rocker has been nominated twice for a Latin
Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   Iraida Noriega, "Efecto Mariposa," Opcion Sonica. The jazz
pianist-vocalist, who is of Cuban and Mexican descent, offers
bilingual interpretations of Latin and American standards, including
an unusual, improvisational version of "Besame Mucho."</TE>
<TE>   Cabaret 2000, "Three Mexican Cabaret Divas," Discos Cabaret. A
sampling from Leon, Felipe and performance artist Astrid Hadad. Opens
with Felipe's wickedly satirical "Mala" and includes occasionally
X-rated lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magos Herrera and Iraida Noriega open the Mexican Divas Night Live
series Wednesday at the Mayan Theatre, 1038 S. Hill St., L.A., 8 p.m.
$20 in advance, $25 at door. (213) 746-4287.</TE>

<HD>When You Can Believe the Hype</HD>
<DH>Tempted to tune out while the media praise an artist
incessantly? Alicia Keys and Norah Jones prove that buzz isn't
necessarily overkill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Prince, U2 and Nirvana have in
common, in addition to their success and influence?</LD>
<LD>   They were all labeled "Hype"--with a capital H--early in their
careers.</LD>
<LD>   That term continues to surface every time a new artist receives
what appears to be excessive media attention.</LD>
<TE>   Think Alicia Keys last year and Norah Jones this year.</TE>
<TE>   Keys, the young R&amp;B singer from New York, generated so much media
heat that her debut album entered the sales chart at No. 1, raising
immediate suspicions among many pop fans. The success, they assumed,
was record company manipulation--master marketing by J Records' Clive
Davis, the executive who also helped launch Janis Joplin and Whitney
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The label did do a superb job of positioning the gifted singer,
from setting up classy showcase performances to choosing the right
single ("Fallin'") to promote to radio programmers. But Keys' talent
made it all work.</TE>
<TE>   Excited about her potential, the media leaped on her story before
the album hit stores. The momentum continued through her Grammy wins
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Whispers of hype are now beginning to circulate around Jones, a
young, Texas-based pop singer whose debut album on Blue Note Records
has soared into the Top 50 on the national chart. I wasn't immune to
the suggestions. It was easy to be wary when Jones' name popped up
repeatedly in print weeks before her album was released. I even
resisted the album at first because I wanted to make sure I wasn't
being swept along by the critical enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until I accidentally caught Jones' performance on the
Jay Leno show that I started warming to her intimacy and command. The
fact that I'm not alone in thinking she has a chance to be a major
figure means you are going to see a lot about her--and maybe you'll
find yourself instinctively putting up your hype guard.</TE>
<TE>   In an era of media overkill, it's only natural to be skeptical
when something sounds too good to be true--and until you check out
the music, it's hard to tell which highly touted artists are
genuinely worth attention. The danger is letting the media attention
close your mind to exciting new arrivals, including, in the rock
world these days, such passionate bands as the White Stripes, the
Hives and ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. This is
especially true at a time when media space is increasingly devoted to
pop music despite a scarcity of acts worth that attention.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a sobering look at the marginal nature of pop
hit-makers these days, check out the list of 100 best-selling albums
last week. I couldn't fully recommend more than seven, and I wouldn't
want to read about more than a dozen.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder the media get excited when genuinely talented
young stars such as Keys and Jones come along?</TE>
<TE>   When the same faces keep reappearing in print and on TV, the
suspicion is that record company publicity machines are at work--as
opposed to the natural buzz that follows the arrival of underground
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this thinking grows out of the belief that labels have
more power than they actually do in influencing media coverage. In
truth, most of the so-called hype we see is simply media enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Merlis, who was the longtime head of publicity for Warner
Bros. Records before opening a private PR firm last year, says a
publicist's most valuable tool in encouraging members of the media to
write about an artist is the testimony of other journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "A writer can listen to me talk all day and night about how much I
like a new artist, but the writer knows I get paid to say it," he
says. "If I can quote someone who isn't paid, such as someone from
another publication, that holds a lot more weight. One of the most
effective things we can do is use the genuine enthusiasm of the media
to get other media interested."</TE>
<TE>   The textbook story of media excitement perceived as hype occurred
in 1975 when Bruce Springsteen appeared simultaneously on the covers
of Time and Newsweek. It was a revolutionary moment because the
magazines then typically put pop figures on their covers only once or
twice a year--and usually it was cultural sensations along the lines
of Bob Dylan and the Beatles, not some virtually unknown musician.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Appel, an ambitious manager who represented Springsteen in
the '70s, remembers the excitement of seeing Elvis Presley in 1956
and the Beatles in 1964 on the covers of such celebrated magazines as
Life and Look. It was his introduction to both acts, and he raced out
to buy their records.</TE>
<TE>   Appel had such faith in Springsteen that he thought the young New
Jersey rocker could have the same impact if he was on the cover of
national magazines.</TE>
<TE>   So when Newsweek and Time requested interviews for small stories
upon the release of the "Born to Run" album, Appel said no. The only
way he'd let them talk to Springsteen was if they put his picture on
the cover. It was a ridiculous demand, and executives at Columbia
Records, Springsteen's label, told Appel so. The magazines refused
the demand, and the label felt Appel's crazy idea had blown its
chance for valuable national exposure. To everybody's surprise,
however, Newsweek and Time editors became so intrigued by
Springsteen's potential that they reversed themselves and put him on
the cover.</TE>
<TE>   The cries of hype were immediate, and they could have killed the
career of a lesser artist, but Appel figured Springsteen's talent was
strong enough to eventually win over doubters, and he was right.</TE>
<TE>   Most experienced publicity and marketing specialists in the
industry know it's a fine line between buzz and hype, and they try to
avoid crossing it.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to generate just enough exposure so that fans are
turned on to an artist, but not so much so that fans feel they're
being bombarded and force-fed," says Larry Jenkins, senior vice
president of marketing and media for Columbia Records. "Every so
often, the media respond en masse to an artist beyond anyone's
expectations and that response feeds on itself and evolves into
hype."</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Schneider, whose L.A.-based MSO public relations firm
represents such acts as Alanis Morissette, David Bowie and Tom Petty,
also stresses the danger of too much media attention. "Artists should
pursue artistry. The ones who chase celebrity will inevitably suffer
from hype."</TE>
<TE>   Record companies throw millions annually into publicity to keep
trying to update artists' images in an era when audience loyalty is
extremely low.</TE>
<TE>   Bryn Bridenthal, who is head of publicity at DreamWorks Records,
whose roster includes such highly touted newcomers as Nelly Furtado
and Rufus Wainwright, says the ultimate distinction between hype and
buzz often depends on whether the artist delivers. "If I'm Paul
Revere running through town saying, 'The British are coming, the
British are coming,' and the British don't come, that's hype. But if
the British do come, it's a different story. The same with pop music.
If the artist delivers, nothing else really matters."</TE>

<DH>While nudity in other areas of our culture has become
ho-hum, on the stage it still holds the power to shock, amuse,
titillate--and make us think.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The evening sticks in Jerry Mitchell's mind as an example of how
full-frontal nudity in live theater can actually be, well, "a family
affair."</LD>
<LD>   It was a performance that Mitchell, a veteran Broadway
choreographer, saw while sipping sangria in a provincial Spanish
town, at an outdoor stage under a dreamy moonlit sky--"the most
magical night of my life." A tongue-in-cheek version of the biblical
story of creation, it featured not one, but two Adams and Eves,
bouncing around in the buff. At one point--"I kid you not," Mitchell
says--the two Adams started "shaking each others' penises, and every
time they did, a sound would go, 'Bd-ringg! Bd-ringg!'" Meanwhile the
all-ages audience pointed and shrieked with laughter.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, you'll find much more outrageous and explicit stuff just by
surfing the Internet, flipping on cable TV or cruising your local
suburban cineplex, says Mitchell, who's choreographing "The Full
Monty," that mostly PG-rated homage to blue-collar male bonding that
opens Wednesday at the Ahmanson Theatre. But seldom, Mitchell
believes, can these other media match the visceral energy, the human
expressive potential, that nudity packs in live theater.</LD>
<TE>   "I think nudity on stage is much more powerful than nudity in
film," he said during a rehearsal break. "And it's different in
different countries. We are a much more uptight society about being
naked than Spain, than London even, than Amsterdam for sure. Yet look
at any advertisement and how do we sell underwear, how do we sell
socks, how do we sell perfume, how do we sell anything in this
country? It's by having a naked body next to it. It's such a
different kind of aesthetic here."</TE>
<TE>   Nudity in theater can wear many different masks. It can be
revolutionary or regressive, powerful or pointless. It can be comic,
erotic, heroic, subversive, insightful or just plain god-awful. It
may be as old as the art of theater itself, a vestigial remnant of
ancient tribal rituals designed to sublimate or stoke primitive
passions. In 1st century Rome, female mimes frequently stripped for
the pleasure of onlookers. In the 19th century, naked actors posed in
tableaux vivant re-creations of classical paintings and sculptures,
shielding prurient interest with the fig leaf of art.</TE>
<TE>   Several decades later, those performers' descendants (of both
sexes) are tossing away their underwear and inhibitions on stages in
Los Angeles, New York and around the world. In David Hare's "The Blue
Room," which closes today at the Pasadena Playhouse, a roundelay of
couples in various stages of undress probe the perilous intersection
of sex and power. On Broadway, a stage adaptation of "The Graduate"
recently opened to a round of Bronx cheers, after an earlier West End
version left London's male critics in a lather. And after premiering
two years ago at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, "The Full Monty" is
still charming the pants off New York and London audiences with its
story of six unemployed Buffalo steelworkers who resolve to earn
quick cash by making like Chippendales dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, actors are getting naked. And whenever that happens,
the artistic stakes go up; the creative temperature rises. The stark
presence of an actor au naturel tests the invisible boundary between
performer and audience, flirts with the danger zone where empathy can
turn to embarrassment and seduction to squeamishness--or vice
versa--in the flicker of a bare thigh, the flash of a breast.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, live theater may be one of the last bastions of
meaningful nudity left in American culture. In Hollywood movies and
on cable television, naked bodies have become as pervasive as
minivans--and, consequently, about as exciting. The explosion of
triple-X Web sites, the spread of video porn to suburban living rooms
and the slither (or, if you will, the grueling forced march) of sex
and sexuality up Main Street and down every back alley of popular
culture have caused nudity to gradually lose much of its physical and
symbolic potency.</TE>
<TE>   But in live theater, nudity still matters. There, it still exerts
the power to shock, titillate, unnerve and, occasionally, overwhelm.
When nudity in live theater is used effectively, it communicates to
an audience on a rare, heightened level of intimacy. It can take on
metaphorical rather than literal shadings, which veil the human body
even while mercilessly exposing its every bulge and blemish. Contrary
to appearances, or audience expectations, sex is sometimes the last
thing that nudity in live theater is really about.</TE>
<TE>   "Nudity has become symbolic of sex, or a metaphor for sexual
activity, in contemporary movies, which then tend not to explore
sexuality very well," says playwright David Henry Hwang, whose 1988
Tony-winning drama, "M. Butterfly," turned a male character's
full-frontal display into a spectacular revelation about
cross-cultural deception and denial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as though because we can show nude bodies [in film and TV],
that becomes the metaphor, or the stand-in, for any more complicated
investigation of what nudity is," Hwang continues. "I think that's
why, in a funny way, nudity has a greater impact on stage, because
we're to some extent relating with and empathizing with and
interacting with a live person on stage who is exposed to us, and
therefore it can be more powerful, and also more distracting and more
embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, stage nudity has been harnessed to a variety of
metaphorical conceits and aesthetic strategies. To grasp nudity's
narrative, symbolic and pictorial possibilities, consider how
differently it's used in shows as varied as "Hair," "Wit," "Angels in
America," "Equus," "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," "Love!
Valour! Compassion!," "Six Degrees of Separation" and "Naked Boys
Singing," the wildly popular gay musical revue that originated at the
Celebration Theatre in Hollywood and is nearing the third year of its
off-Broadway run.</TE>
<TE>   Even a show in which nudity is pretty much the entire point, like
the erotic musical revue "Oh! Calcutta!," can be seen as a commentary
on America's shifting sexual mores during the late 1960s and '70s.
(When it closed in August 1989, "Oh! Calcutta!" was the
second-longest-running musical in Broadway history.)</TE>
<TE>   Add to this mix, if you dare, the raw, confrontational,
thematically rich performance art of Karen Finley, who often performs
in the nude. Or that of L.A.-based Ron Athey, who deliberately
abstracts his naked body by piercing, mutilating, stigmatizing and
fetishizing it, transforming his muscular physique into a contested
space on which elaborate metaphysical struggles are symbolically
enacted. To some viewers, Athey's performances bring to mind baroque
depictions of St. Bartholomew, or a Renaissance Christ in the throes
of agony/ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   "My work is about schisms and neuroses and spiritual dilemmas, so
eroticism as such is not a big part of it," Athey says. "You could
say it's the opposite of some of the gay theater one sees: It's
desexualizing the body."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Charles Livingston, managing artistic director of
Celebration Theatre, which produces work by and about gay men and
lesbians says that the not-uncommon use of male nudity in gay plays
reflects "a comfort level of sensuality" among gay men "that straight
men aren't allowed to have."</TE>
<TE>   "That gives our writers more freedom and our audiences more
freedom to accept [nudity] on stage," he says. "The danger is that a
lot of gay men who aren't necessarily theater lovers but who go to
the theater if there's a nude man on stage, [think] that's what gay
theater is."</TE>
<TE>   Perceptions of nudity are not only culturally conditioned; they
also lie in the eye of the beholder. Athey has several theories on
this. "I think people that are heavily tattooed aren't naked, and I
think people with heavily muscled armature aren't naked," he says.
"If there's no hair and the skin is monotone, there's still genitals,
but there's not that stark raving nakedness. It's not the vulnerable
body. I still equate nakedness with vulnerability."</TE>
<TE>   Even veteran performers may want to reach for a loincloth when
making their nude debut. When he starred as the Marquis de Sade in
the 1996 Geffen Playhouse production of "Quills," Howard Hesseman
says, the hardest part was getting naked for the first time. "I must
credit my wife with giving me the courage to say, 'Just do it; the
sooner you do it, the better. Then you can leave whatever it means to
expose yourself totally, physically, you can start leaving that in
your dressing room, in the wings. You don't have to bring it on
stage.'"</TE>
<TE>   During performances, Hesseman says, he was so intently focused on
stage business--hitting his marks, synchronizing dialogue and
movement--that "it was almost stripping by the numbers. I just forgot
about the fact that I was nude."</TE>
<TE>   There were, however, a few instances "when I moved downstage and
sat on some steps that extended out from the apron to the center
aisle of the Geffen Playhouse. And I was peripherally aware of people
in those seats. My sense of them was always that they were rearing
back and slightly away as I approached," says Hesseman, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Director Jack O'Brien, who has shepherded "The Full Monty" from
his home base at San Diego's Globe Theatres to Broadway, London and
now L.A., says the initial experience of stripping "is a big thing"
for the show's cast. But, he adds, "nobody in any of the companies
has come into it grimly, saying, 'I don't want to do this.'"</TE>
<TE>   "On some level, they do want to do it, which is also very
interesting," O'Brien says. "There may be, sleeping inside all of us,
a baby exhibitionist sort of struggling to get out. And that's, of
course, part of an actor's makeup anyway, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   There's little doubt that nudity sells seats, whether it's
highbrow, middlebrow or no-brow: Jude Law in Cocteau's
"Indiscretions" on Broadway in 1995, or "Jeff Stryker Does Hard Time"
at a West Hollywood playhouse a few years back. But without adequate
artistry, theatrical nudity may be all cheese- or beefcake and no
bun.</TE>
<TE>   Take the recent Broadway opening of "The Graduate," an adaptation
of the 1967 film about a confused ex-college student's sexual
peregrinations. In his review of the play, New York Times critic Ben
Brantley led with a dismissive two-word sentence: "Twenty seconds."
That, Brantley noted, was the amount of time that actress Kathleen
Turner appears stark naked as the wily Mrs. Robinson--the only
noteworthy feature in a yawner of an evening.</TE>
<TE>   Compare this with the reaction to another 20-second nude interval,
in Margaret Edson's drama "Wit," which won a Pulitzer, a Tony
nomination for its star, Kathleen Chalfant, and later was adapted for
cable with Emma Thompson in the lead. "Wit," which premiered at South
Coast Repertory in 1995 and was produced at the Geffen in 2000,
concerns a middle-aged English professor who uses John Donne's
ecstatic poetry to buffer herself from the ravages of cancer. At the
very end she slips out of her hospital gown and walks naked toward an
enveloping light, the last of her intellectual defenses stripped
away, at peace with her human destiny. Usually, the part of the
audience that isn't sobbing breaks into wild applause, as much for
the actress' courage and generosity as for the scene's lyrical
perfection.</TE>
<TE>   At its least effective, theatrical nudity can be a distraction at
a crucial moment. When Hwang was writing "M. Butterfly," he says, one
early draft didn't include the famous nude scene in which Song
Liling, a Communist male spy impersonating a female Chinese Opera
performer, reveals his true identity to his male French-diplomat
lover by stripping. (The play, incredibly, is based on a true
incident.)</TE>
<TE>   Hwang says he was mindful of a comment made by the show's
director, John Dexter. Referring to the mid-century stage idol Alfred
Lunt, Dexter said: "If you have a penis here and you have Alfred Lunt
here, everybody's always looking at the penis." "I think John's
comment speaks to the dangers of nudity," Hwang says dryly.
Ultimately, though, he decided to include his coup de theatre because
he believed that "the diplomat's belief in Song as a woman was so
incontrovertible that he needed to be slapped with unassailable
evidence."</TE>
<TE>   As often as not, theatrical nudity is about physical and emotional
vulnerability, a psychological as well as physical disrobing of
character. "Baring it all doesn't just necessarily mean taking off
your clothes," says "The Full Monty's" Mitchell, who conceived,
directed and choreographed the lucrative fund-raiser "Broadway
Bares," a comedy burlesque performed annually for the AIDS charity
Broadway Cares. "It means letting people see it all--not just the
genital area, but the whole soul."</TE>
<TE>   It's ironic that the minimal, blink-and-you'll-miss-it nudity in
"The Full Monty" has earned the show a risque reputation. In
historical terms, "The Full Monty" might almost be seen as
leapfrogging back before 1968, when "Hair" sent Broadway into a tizzy
by ending Act 1 with nearly its entire cast in the buff. "Hair," of
course, sought to capture the zeitgeist of the rebellious,
let-it-all-hang-out '60s, when sex was openly politicized and
cavorting naked in the mud at Woodstock was a form of agitprop
exhibitionism.</TE>
<TE>   Where "The Full Monty" makes something akin to a political gesture
is in drawing attention to the nude male body, a subject more
typically the provenance of avant-garde artists and photographers
than of big Broadway musicals. In "The Full Monty," the male
characters have been stripped of their jobs, their dignity--the
accouterments of masculine identity. Metaphorically, they're already
naked because they've lost the trappings of what writer Susan Faludi
("Stiffed") has called "masculine utility," the vestments that
career, marriage, fatherhood and a defined social role have
traditionally conferred on men.</TE>
<TE>   The characters' triumph lies in finding a way to convert their
disempowerment into an occasion for emotional growth and connection.
These hulking guys are humanized by experiencing, for once in their
lives, what most women (and, the show implies, many gay men)
experience every day: being judged on the basis of their outward
appearance. The men of "The Full Monty" rise above those limitations
of the flesh. For the men of "The Full Monty," Mitchell says, "nudity
suggests freedom," the freedom "to accomplish anything."</TE>
<TE>   The gender role-reversal that animates "The Full Monty"
underscores the difference that still exists between onstage male and
female nudity. "Female nudity is as old as the hills. We've been
muses for men for eons," says actress CCH Pounder, who recently took
part in a symposium on "I think nudity in women is so tied up in
fertility and reproduction that it does have a different connotation.
A man's nudity is always a much more vulnerable thing."</TE>
<TE>   For Pounder, those differences were encapsulated in a trip she
once made with some female friends to a male exotic dance club. "Most
of us were fairly prim and proper, but by the end everybody was
having a grand old time, even if you weren't participating, just the
voyeurism," Pounder recalls. "It was just a scene of sheer, raucous
joy, of women screaming and emboldening themselves as they approached
these G-strings. It was such a turn of events."</TE>
<TE>   Male nudity, of course, has long ceased to be a novelty in
so-called "gay theater," a term that's become increasingly slippery
since the mainstream success of plays like Tony Kushner's "Angels in
America" and Terrence McNally's "Love! Valour! Compassion!" For a
time, in the early- to mid-1990s, male nudity in gay-themed plays
practically seemed compulsory, a reaction, some say, to the
conservatism of the Reagan-Bush years and the devastating toll of the
AIDS epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   "AIDS, I think, made a lot of gay men feel ugly physically,"
Celebration's Livingston says. "Not only our bodies were being
beaten, our spirits were as well. It was the thought that sensuality
had been so degraded by those first years of AIDS that we needed to
break free of it."</TE>
<TE>   Conventions of nudity in gay theater remain different from those
where the implicit viewpoint is heterosexual. "The roots of [nudity]
in gay theater came from a very wonderful place, a very honest place:
'I wanna see, it's taboo, let's do it!'" says playwright Oliver
Mayer, whose "Blade to the Heat," produced at New York's Public
Theater and the Mark Taper Forum, probes issues of cultural identity,
hidden homosexuality and the psychological depths of male violence
among a group of boxers in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, I think there was a great reason to get naked in
gay theater," Mayer goes on. "One thing I hate about straight
theater--'highball-on-sofas theater'--it's all about layers of
civilizing talk. It's not active. If anything, people just put more
and more layers of protective stuff on themselves. A lot of it's
language. I don't want to write plays like that."</TE>
<TE>   When Mayer decided to include a nude shower scene in "Blade to the
Heat," he says, he was consciously creating an erotic spectacle for
straight as well as gay viewers. "I wanted to show him in his
altogether to a large audience that I know, after 15 years in the
theater, is a white audience and a privileged audience," he says. "I
confess on one level to the prurient side: I knew they'd get excited.
I knew it would be exciting, celebrating, and in a deeper way that it
would be something they'd never seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, when the show was staged in Mexico City, the director
used nudity not for erotic effect but as a blunt political instrument
to "pummel his culture," Mayer says, not disapprovingly. "Everybody
got naked all the time [in that production]. The gods of Latin
culture signified like crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In politics and art, nudity and issues of free expression have
long been joined at the hip. Ever since the days of the first
Christian emperors of Rome, the political powers that be have tried
to keep a lid on staged nudity. According to the Cambridge Guide to
the Theatre, the emperor Justinian mandated that mimes, tumblers and
acrobats wear drawers, and the medieval church's ban on public nudity
meant that the Adam and Eve of the mystery plays had to wear
"form-fitting doeskin."</TE>
<TE>   Although the political dust-ups of the '80s and '90s that pitted
Sen. Jesse Helms against performers like Finley and Athey have
subsided--due in part to the fiscal denuding of the National
Endowment for the Arts--1st Amendment issues surrounding nudity and
sexual expression haven't gone away.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are living in a period of regression in those areas in
many ways," says Arthur Allan Seidelman, who directed "Hair" for the
Reprise! series last June at Brentwood's Wadsworth Theater. Citing
the conservative politics of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, Seidelman
says, "We're constantly battling the forces of discontent, the forces
that think the human body is corruption."</TE>
<TE>   "Good" theatrical nudity may continue to be hard to define, but
most of us think we know it when we see it. And through repeated
exposure, rather than feeling blase, we may gradually become more
comfortable in our own skins.</TE>

<DH>New series honor Swedish director Mauritz Stiller and the
influential Cahiers du Cinema critic-filmmakers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles cineastes should be in celluloid heaven for the next few
weeks with the arrival of two major retrospectives highlighting the
work of several influential European filmmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA Film and Television Archive's "The Golden Age of Mauritz
Stiller" features 10 films from the long-neglected Swedish silent
film director. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's "A 50th
Anniversary Tribute to Cahiers du Cinema" emphasizes the early years
of the French film magazine as well as more contemporary French
directors that the publication has influenced.</LD>
<LD>   Seventy-four years after his death, Stiller is finally getting the
renewed attention he deserves. For years, he was best known as the
director who made Greta Garbo a star when he cast her in his 1924
"The Atonement of Gosta Berling, Parts I and II." The success of that
film bought them both to Hollywood. Garbo flourished; Stiller
floundered.</LD>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury, when he was given a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame in 1960, his name was inscribed as "Maurice Diller." The
mistake wasn't corrected until several years later.</TE>
<TE>   From World War I until the mid-'20s, the Swedish film industry
flourished, influencing European and American directors in style and
subject matter. But Stiller has taken a back seat to the other noted
Swedish director of the period, Victor Sjostrom. Unlike Stiller,
Sjostrom had several successes in the U.S., including the 1926 MGM
film "The Wind," with Lillian Gish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a rediscovery of Stiller happening right now
which is partially being promoted by the Swedish Film Institute,"
UCLA programmer David Pendelton says. "This retrospective was done in
London and is traveling around the States."</TE>
<TE>   The series kicks off Saturday at UCLA's James Bridges Theater with
three of Stiller's earliest films, 1916's "Love and Journalism" and
"The Wings" and 1917's "Thomas Graal's Best Film."</TE>
<TE>   Andreas Ekman, Swedish consul general in Los Angeles, says Stiller
and Sjostrom are household names to film fans in Sweden. "There are
some films that are part of our heritage like 'Sir Arne's Treasure,'
which is an adaptation of a book. Also another one of Stiller's
adaptations is the 'Gosta Berling' story, which actually brought
Greta Garbo to fame. These adaptations were done in a very dramatic
way."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Finland of Russian Jewish heritage, Moshe Stiller fled to
Sweden after he was drafted into the czar's army. Changing his name
to Mauritz Stiller, he distinguished himself as a stage director and
actor. In 1912, he began working in film. His films ranged from
delightful comedies like "Thomas Graal's Best Film" and the sequel,
"Thomas Graal's Best Child" (1918)--both starring Sjostrom--and
1920's "Erotikon" to such dramas as 1916's "The Wings," which subtly
explored homosexuality, and "Sir Arne's Treasure" (1919), a haunting
tale about an orphaned girl who unwittingly falls in love with the
man who murdered her foster family.</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish Film Institute has restored all films in the
retrospective. Because all but the silent "Graal" comedies have
Swedish titles, UCLA will have a translator at the screenings; Robert
Israel will provide live musical accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   Pendleton sees Stiller has a precursor to Swedish director Ingmar
Bergman, who came to fame in the '50s. "They are both people who move
back and forth very well between farce and sort of comedy of manners
to psychological drama to self-reflecting filmmaking. Sjostrom has
long been this figure who is respected because he is part of film
history. But looking at these Stiller films, they in some ways seem
fresher and more contemporary to us now, particularly because there
is much more humor in his work."</TE>
<TE>   Because his films were visually striking and often funny, it's
hard to believe he couldn't find a home in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have conjectured that Stiller didn't work well in the
Hollywood hierarchical studio system with big budgets," Pendleton
says. "He was somebody who came out of smaller Stockholm theater
circles, more like an impresario or entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   Stiller died at 45 in 1928. His "Hotel Imperial" is the only film
that still exists from his four-year stint in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Since Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Lo Duca and the renowned critic
Andre Bazin created Cahiers du Cinema (Book of Cinema) in 1951, it
has been one of the most influential film publications. The magazine
was an offshoot of Revue du Cinema, published by Jean-Georges Auriol
and two Parisian film clubs, Objectif 49 and Cine-Club du Quartier
Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Horak, a UCLA film professor and curator of the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum, believes Cahiers "may be the most influential
film magazine in the history of films that there is because, first of
all, a number of younger critics who initially started publishing in
Cahiers became very famous filmmakers like Francois Truffaut,
Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol.
When they started writing in Cahiers, they were writing already with
the idea they would become filmmakers."</TE>
<TE>   The festival, which is based on a longer series presented by the
Film Society of Lincoln Center, showcases the films of Godard
("Breathless"), Truffaut ("Day for Night"), Chabrol ("Les Bonnes
Femmes"), Rohmer ("My Night at Maud's"), Rivette ("Celine and Julie
Go Boating"), as well as work by the directors they championed:
Jean-Pierre Melville ("Le Doulos"), Jean Renoir ("The Golden Coach"),
Jean Cocteau ("Orpheus") and Robert Bresson ("Pickpocket").</TE>
<TE>   The festival concludes with two films from the 1990s: Andre
Techine's "Wild Reeds" and Olivier Assayas' "Irma Vep." Both
directors have been influenced by Cahiers.</TE>
<TE>   The young Turks who originally wrote for Cahiers were particularly
interested in American cinema, and came up with the "auteur" theory
of filmmaking. "The auteur theory stated the director was the most
important creative force in this communal process of filmmaking,"
Horak says. "Films of value should not be judged by their script or
their literary contents but in fact by their visual style."</TE>
<TE>   The critics singled out American filmmakers who worked in such
genres as westerns and film noirs "that have consistent styles
despite the fact that they get lots of different scripts," Horak
says. "They named as their primary evidence people like John Ford and
Howard Hawks and Hitchcock too."</TE>
<TE>   They came down particularly hard on French filmmakers involved in
"cinema of quality"--movies that emphasized the script.</TE>
<TE>   "Formerly, directors who had been held in high esteem like Julien
Duvivier or Rene Clair were suddenly out, and other directors who had
been neglected by the critics like Jean Renoir were in," Horak adds.
"Of course, most importantly, they said there needs to be room for
new directors, and they meant themselves."</TE>
<TE>   In part, the Cahiers writers could study so many American films
because France was deluged with U.S. work after the country was
liberated from the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, they were able to put large amounts of films
into the market, films that long ago had made their money in other
countries," Horak says. "So the critics were able to see four years
of production in one fell sweep, so they were able to see trends
other American critics had not seen because you had seen them day to
day."</TE>
<TE>   The magazine changed focus in 1968, says Marsha Kinder, chairman
of critical studios at the USC School of Cinema-Television. "There is
a movement away from that auteur theory and a movement toward
politicizing cinema," she says. During this time, for example, Godard
became a Maoist and proclaimed in Cahiers that the 1957 Doris Day
musical "The Pajama Game" was the perfect Marxist musical.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was that you really needed to engage with ideology, and
all cinema was political,'' Kinder says, "even the most delightful
musical cartoons."</TE>

<LD>If you had a successful play, you should not fuss with construction,
Alfred Hitchcock told Peter Bogdanovich about resisting the
temptation to "open up" the film version of "Dial M for Murder"
("Making Friends With Claustrophobia," by Hugh Hart, April 14).</LD>
<LD>   That is certainly consistent with Hitchcock's MO in a number of
his other films in which a confined atmosphere was significant in
achieving his trademark suspense and edgy unease. Among these are
"Rebecca" (set in Manderley), "Lifeboat" (cited by Guillermo del
Toro), "Rope" (set in a New York City apartment), "Rear Window" (also
set in a Manhattan apartment) and "Psycho" (set at the Bates Motel
and house). Other Hitchcock films with a confined construct include
"Spellbound," "Notorious," "The Paradine Case" and "The Birds."</LD>
<LD>   Hart's sidebar listing single-set movies that provided great
acting opportunities could have included two additional Humphrey
Bogart films--"The Desperate Hours" and "Key Largo"--and a number of
films featuring tours de force by any actor who ever appeared in a
movie set aboard a submarine or an ocean liner.</LD>

<HD>Harold Williams and the Getty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many perfectly valid criticisms one can make of various
decisions Harold Williams made during the 17 years he presided over
the Getty as chief executive ("Art for Architecture's Sake," by
Nicolai Ouroussoff, March 31).</LD>
<LD>   The site and the architect are certainly both fair game. But
Ouroussoff's assertion that "Williams also led the fight to transform
the complex into a complex of art-related activities, relegating its
collections to secondary status" is simply ludicrous. First, there
was no fight: Williams presented his recommendations in 1982, and the
board accepted them. Second, when Williams assumed the reins, the J.
Paul Getty Museum had three collections: a highly regarded collection
of French decorative arts, a good collection of Greek and Roman
antiquities, and a paintings collection that was a laughingstock.</LD>
<TE>   By the time he retired, there were four new departments; two of
them, the manuscripts and photography collections, are considered to
be among the finest in the country. The once pitiable paintings
collection grew to be more than respectable, with the addition of
literally dozens of first-rate works by major artists--Mantegna,
Pontormo, Fra Bartolommeo, Correggio, Brueghel, Rembrandt, Van Gogh,
Cezanne, Monet, Ensor, among many others. Ouroussoff may find the
Getty's collections disappointing--it has plenty of shortcomings, to
be sure--but not because Harold Williams was anything other than
fully committed to making them as good as they could be.</TE>

<TE>   Ouroussoff might have included the Beyler in Basel, Switzerland,
not for any grandiose architectural qualities, but for its attention
to the environment. Its collection of 20th century art is housed
under a roof that not only regulates light admission, but also
controls fluctuating temperatures at the gallery ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   This building and other environmentally sound architecture is the
subject of an exhibition titled "Ten Shades of Green," showing
through June 30 at the Orange County Museum of Art in Newport Beach.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Memento," David R. Ginsburg suggests that Harold Pinter
originated the story-told-backward gimmick in his 1978 play
"Betrayal" (Letters, April 14). Well, kudos for knowing that, but,
um, no. No less than George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart used the device
earlier in their bittersweet romance "Merrily We Roll Along," which
opened on Broadway in the fall of 1934, and was recently musicalized
by the equally distinguished Stephen Sondheim and George Furth.</LD>

<LD>I found Don Heckman's piece regarding young jazz singers and their
ever-growing younger audience of great interest and quite on target
("The Search Is On," April 14). A lifelong musician, I have watched
my three sons' interest in music evolve over the past few years. My
oldest, at 14, is the pianist in his high school jazz band. The
contemporary landscape of popular music inspires little but boredom
in all but the dullest of the young--hence the present state of the
business.</LD>
<LD>   I must concur with "The Great One," Mr. Dylan, in his
extraordinary interview with Robert Hilburn, which appeared
previously in Calendar. Architecture might very well be an
interesting option for the creative young person, given the artistic
quality of today's pop music artist.</LD>
<LD>   As one who spends a great amount of time in the company of young
musicians, including my son's associates and Righteous Brother Bill
Medley's incredibly talented daughter, McKenna (of whom we will hear
much), I really can't imagine an intelligent young person aspiring to
be Britney Spears or the lead singer of Staind.</LD>
<TE>   My son, for one, is more drawn to interesting intervals than
interesting tattoos, smoking techniques or breast implants. And he
knows who Tony Blair is as well.</TE>

<TE>   I'm surprised Don Heckman did not mention one of the best female
jazz singer-piano players on the current scene: Patricia Barber. So I
guess I'll have to. She's hip, cool, intelligent, moody, swinging and
smoky-sounding, in the Annie Ross-Sheila Jordan tradition. Barber has
them all beat, including Diana Krall. I wish that she would come to
L.A.</TE>

<DH>Through dance and costumes, a South Korean shaman seeks
community harmony 10 years after the L.A. riots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Kim Kumhwa was born in 1931 in Hwanghae-do, a province now in
North Korea, her maternal grandmother had a dream in which she saw a
dragon rising toward the sky--a sign, the family believed, that the
coming baby would rise to greatness. Such a premonition led everyone
to believe that the coming baby would be a boy. Kim's gender was a
surprise, but the premonition played out.</LD>
<LD>   Kim is now one of South Korea's most famous shamans--celebrating
rituals that are part of the country's folk religion and central to
its music and dance traditions. She travels the world with a group of
performers to re-create selected rituals known as kut (pronounced
coot). Indeed, Kim was granted Living National Treasure status in
South Korea in 1984. Next Sunday, she and 11 other shamans and
performers will arrive at L.A.'s Lafayette Park for a ceremony meant
to promote community harmony and reconciliation in observance of the
10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots.</LD>
<LD>   The kut will include colorful costumes, flags, offerings,
elaborate ritualized movement and improvisation. It is meant to
provide repose for the souls trapped in the chaos of the riots as
well as good fortune for those who survived.</LD>
<TE>   Kim's last appearance in the United States was in 1982, to observe
the 100th anniversary of South Korean-American relations. Speaking by
phone via translator from her home in Seoul, the 71-year-old notes
that she has performed rituals for everything from assuring
successful fishing to the exorcising of evil spirits, but that the
Los Angeles kut is a first.</TE>
<TE>   The riots, she says "were reported in a large way here. One of the
things we pursue is reconciliation and bringing people together in
village harmony. It will be a first time I'm [doing] a kut for that
purpose in the United States. All kuts, especially village-scale kind
of kuts, are the things we pursue.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a year," she continues, "we go to the DMZ to placate the
bereaved souls who died in the Korean War, and also to pray for
unification with the North. Praying for this kind of thing requires
that people set their hearts straight and also their han--a grudge or
frustration that builds up because of conflict of one's own
unreasonable ambitions. It causes problems and harms yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Kim was initiated at the age of 17 into her role as a mudang, or
shaman, by her grandmother, also a mudang. Her path to shamanism
began, she says, when she was 11 and came down with a serious illness
that she says "turned out to be a form of possession."</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the hospital. My body only started to improve when I
began to recognize that maybe I was being called to be a shaman," she
says. "At first I cried a lot, being scared and unaccepting of what
was happening to me, but when I resigned myself to my fate, and my
grandmother initiated me, it was like becoming a new person."</TE>
<TE>   This new Kim found immediate success as a beacon of spirituality,
performing the trance-induced kuts, which date back several thousand
years. After war broke out in 1950, Kim fled south, eventually moving
to Seoul in 1965. In 1972, she won the National Folk Art Competition,
vaulting her to prominence as a major shaman.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who has a son and two grandchildren, has also initiated
nearly 50 shamans in a country where she says there are about 20,000
ritual healers. Besides performing thousands of small, private
rituals over the years, Kim also appears in shows for the general
public in South Korea 10 to 12 times annually. Other recent stops
include Germany, Australia and China.</TE>
<TE>   Kim is renowned for one rite, the chaktu, or knife dance.
Barefoot, she balances on the sharp side of 2-foot long-blades and
turns 360 degrees. Her trance state is supposed to protect her. But,
having performed the ritual for 55 years, she admits she has been
hurt three times.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get ready to go on the knives, I invite the spirit. As I'm
on the knives, there's a sense that some other power has come in me
and is holding me on them--holding me up from them. When that is
severe, I sort of run upon them and am elevated up there that much
faster. Sometimes, when I don't get the sense that I'm being pulled
along, I actually do feel a sense of fear. But when I do get up on
the knives, I'm OK and give special thanks afterward."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Tangherlini, an associate professor of Korean folklore at
UCLA, has seen Kim perform numerous times, both in South Korea and in
the States.</TE>
<TE>   "Korean shamanism is both visually exciting and engaging," he
said. "There are startling juxtapositions, enthusiastic dancing with
soulful, mournful singing. It's obvious why Kim is a national
treasure when you see her perform. She invokes the spirits with
remarkable skill. I think it's great she's coming to L.A. If you
wanted to do an event that will help promote the healing between
communities, she would be right there at the top of my list."</TE>
<TE>   Korean arts devotee and former director of development at the
Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and at KCRW radio,
Lauren Deutsch is responsible, along with Anaheim-based South Baylo
University, a school of acupuncture, for bringing Kim and company to
Los Angeles. Deutsch, who met Kim in 1991 and has made many sojourns
to South Korea to see her perform, believes in the importance of
ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old times, when there was discord in the community, people
would go to the village shaman and say, 'We're having village
disharmony.' This is the foundation of most cultures, when medicine,
spirituality and art were inseparable--when art was potent, and we
respected the art of healers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a way to observe the anniversary of the L.A.
riots and understand more about tolerance," Deutsch continues. "I
thought it would be terrific to bring Kim and her group here. I hope
that L.A. gets a good party."</TE>
<TE>   As for Kim, who is in robust health and jogs every morning, she
feels that the spirits she invokes--in earth, in heaven and
particularly in nature--are all little gods. When asked if she has
plans to retire, she says matter-of-factly, "I can't answer that
question. I've got to keep at it and go until I don't have to
anymore. But it's really not up to me."</TE>

<HD>The Hives Break Out With a Unique Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The buzzing around the Hives--the neo-garage punk band from Sweden
that has drawn some of the strongest major-label interest of the
year--has taken on a new tone with word that the band was joining the
Warner Bros. Records family.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a surprise that Warner Bros. got the band. Chairman and
CEO Tom Whalley has established the company as an aggressive force
since coming over from Interscope Records last year.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise is the arrangement through which the Hives come to
the Burbank firm: a one-time partnership with independent L.A. punk
label Epitaph Records, which had licensed rights to the group's 2000
album, "Vini Vidi Vicious," from Swedish label Burning Heart Records,
and also owns U.S. rights to the next album.</LD>
<TE>   While it's not uncommon for independent labels to make deals with
major labels for bands that outgrow the indie world, it's
unprecedented for Epitaph, the launching pad for the Offspring and
the home of Rancid and Bad Religion.</TE>
<TE>   Even when Epitaph was white-hot with the Offspring and Rancid in
the mid-'90s, label owner Brett Gurewitz steadfastly turned down
offers of all sorts from major labels, and turned his back on
millions of dollars in the process--including offers from Whalley at
Interscope.</TE>
<TE>   "I first met Brett through dealing with him when he had the
Offspring and talked about buying his company," Whalley says.</TE>
<TE>   But the two became friends and remained in touch over the years.
When the Warner executive got wind that Gurewitz might actually
entertain offers for the Hives, he jumped. The Hives have become a
big hit in England with their witty, biting rock and have recently
started to get breakthrough airplay at key U.S. rock radio stations,
including L.A.'s KROQ-FM (106.7).</TE>
<TE>   "I had been hearing about the Hives for a while," Whalley says. "I
really wasn't paying that much attention to them but had heard about
them having a lot of success in England. When I heard Brett was
looking for a partner, I grabbed their albums and thought they
sounded amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Whalley called Gurewitz, and before he knew it, the two were on a
plane to Sweden to explain the new arrangement to the band.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised, because Brett was fiercely independent,"
Whalley says. "Over the years he's always said, 'No, not interested.'
I was shocked he said yes."</TE>
<TE>   Gurewitz, who opted to let Whalley speak for him for this story,
had not really had a band in such demand since the Offspring and
Rancid, and feared a repeat of the episode when the Offspring bolted
Epitaph for a deal with Columbia Records.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he wanted to go through that situation again,"
Whalley says. "And the Hives had moved into a situation where a major
can put up the money and manpower and relationships that we have with
radio programmers and retailers that are different than what an indie
has. That's the conclusion he came to."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the Hives (who play the Roxy May 27 and 28) will not
be on Warner Bros. Records. Instead, the 2000 album and a next album
will be stamped with the logo of Sire Records. The company, a part of
Warner Bros. in the '70s, '80s and '90s, was the home of the Ramones,
Talking Heads, Madonna and the Smiths, but was deactivated last year
following several corporate restructurings.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked to the band about who we were and the history we have
here," Whalley says. "And [Warner executive] Jeff Ayeroff said, 'See
if they'd be interested in the Sire logo.' They're big fans of the
Ramones, and that label represents that early era of punk. Then
there's Epitaph, which was key in the big '90s punk world. And
Burning Heart has been the top punk label in Sweden."</TE>
<TE>   POPPING FRESH: A recent Mitsubishi ad campaign gave a huge sales
boost to techno act the Wise Guys' 3-year-old song "Start the
Commotion," reaffirming the fact that music in commercials sends
people to record stores. Now a new Mitsubishi spot featuring a woman
in the passenger seat moving her body in the limber, "popping" dance
style of the '70s is sending people hunting for a song as well. But
they're not finding it.</TE>
<TE>   "Days Go By," by English dance music trio Dirty Vegas, hasn't been
released in the U.S. and won't be until sometime in late May, in
advance of the group's debut album on Capitol Records due June 18.</TE>
<TE>   "Some free advertising is great," says Steve Smith, the group's
vocalist. "We've gotten e-mails from friends all across the States
going, 'We can't believe your track is in the commercial.'"</TE>
<TE>   The song was released as a single in England last year but came to
Mitsubishi's ad agency, Deutsch L.A., by happenstance when a video
for the song was included on a reel sent by a director.</TE>
<TE>   "The campaign started as little pieces of pop culture," says
Vincent Picardi, senior vice president and creative director of
Deutsch L.A. "We noticed people would be singing in their cars, so we
did that one [with the Wise Guys song]. Then we thought about
karaoke, but that didn't work and we went to people dancing in cars.
We did some research, found that popping was coming back in England,
and a director had a popper in his video--and that's where we saw the
Dirty Vegas clip."</TE>
<TE>   Smith says the band welcomed the opportunity for exposure and the
fee it was paid, but the trio also liked the aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd seen the previous campaigns," he says. "It's not so much on
the car but more on a vibe, the scene itself."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: A new OutKast song, "Land of a Million Drums," will
be the first single from the soundtrack to the upcoming live-action
"Scooby Doo" movie. Shaggy and MxPx both do versions of the theme
song, and the album, due June 4, also includes a new duet, "Thinking
About You," by Solange (sister of Destiny's Child's Beyonce Knowles,
who co-produced the track) and St. Lunatics' Murphy Lee....</TE>
<TE>   With Blink-182's guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker
having finished their Boxcar Racer side-project album, Barker has
teamed with Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong for another venture, the
Transplants. They're working on an album with plans to release it and
tour in the fall.... "L.A. Law" actress Michelle Greene has recorded
a debut album of original songs, focusing on her mother's Mexican and
Nicaraguan roots. Titled "Ojo de Tiburon," the album is June 11 due
from Appleseed Records.</TE>

<LD>   A man (Val Kilmer) sits beside a duffel bag of money and plays a
trumpet as flames consume the room around him in the opening scene of
"The Salton Sea," a noirish thriller that traverses a Southern
California underworld where nothing is as it seems. The ensemble cast
includes Peter Sarsgaard, right with Kilmer, Deborah Kara Unger,
Vincent D'Onofrio and Adam Goldberg. Opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Also: Superficial Seattle television reporter Angelina Jolie

<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   In her six-part "Chicanos: The Spirit of Aztlan," award-winning
Southland choreographer Gema Sandoval depicts the mythical homeland
of the Aztecs--and by extension the origin of much of Mexican
American culture. Inspired by a 2001 exhibition at the L.A. County
Museum of Art, this full-evening epic traces the evolution of
Mexicano identity from pre-Columbian times to contemporary
California. It will premiere Saturday at the Japan America Theatre in
downtown L.A., performed by Sandoval's Danza Floricanto/USA. Below:

<TE>   Marcia Rodd stars as the upright Southern Jewish matron and Lance
E. Nichols plays her chauffeur in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer
Prize-winning play, "Driving Miss Daisy." The play follows their

Light Opera of South Bay Cities, it opens Friday at Hermosa Beach
Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   James Conlon makes his Los Angeles Philharmonic
subscription-concert debut this week with a Russian program that
includes the suite from Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" that
he recently recorded. The 52-year-old American conductor is familiar
from his summer Hollywood Bowl visits from 1978 to 1980, but he has
since concentrated his activities in Europe--principally at the opera
companies of Cologne and Paris. Besides excerpts from
"Khovanshchina," his program offers the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto
with soloist Sarah Chang.</TE>

<TE>   Director John Moore jumped from commercials to features with the
old-fashioned action-adventure "Behind Enemy Lines." Owen Wilson
plays a hotshot navigator stationed on an aircraft carrier in the
Adriatric, where the U.S. is enforcing an international cease-fire in
Bosnia. But he and his pilot (Gabriel Macht) see something they
shouldn't during a Christmas Day fly-over and are shot down. Gene
Hackman plays the carrier's admiral. The militarily authentic film

<LD>   BADLY DRAWN BOY</LD>
<LD>   "About a Boy"</LD>
<TE>   ARTISTdirect Records/</TE>
<TE>   XL Recordings</TE>
<TE>   Damon Gough nearly ruined the goodwill and momentum generated by
his stylish 2000 album debut, "The Hour of Bewilderbeast," with a
subsequent series of erratic, often exhausting live shows.</TE>
<TE>   But the Englishman should regain our attention and respect with
this soundtrack collection (due in stores Tuesday), which recaptures
the understated charm and gentle insights of the first album--and
then some.</TE>
<TE>   Gough, who calls himself Badly Drawn Boy after a British cartoon
strip, didn't just rummage through his record collection to find
tracks that reflect the mood of the film--often the norm these days
when putting together soundtracks.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote nine songs and assorted instrumental passages for the
film, which is based on a novel by "High Fidelity" author (and
sometime New Yorker pop critic) Nick Hornby.</TE>
<TE>   The music is likely to remind you of the winsome strains of
Elliott Smith and the folk-period Paul Simon, but the best of these
tunes--including the sweet optimism of "Something to Talk About" and
the unshakable beauty of "Donna and Blitzen"--confirm that Gough is a
singer-songwriter of the top level.</TE>
<TE>   Although not billed as a follow-up to "Bewilderbeast" (that album
is due later in the year), "About a Boy" has a warm, personal edge
that qualifies it as such. A lovely work.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   ELVIS COSTELLO</TE>
<TE>   "When I Was Cruel"</TE>
<TE>   Island Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   So the Mercurial One had enough of ballads and Burt Bacharach, and
decided to get back to his rockin'-er roots with the help of longtime
collaborators Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas. Let the rejoicing
commence, because such selections as the kinetic "Tear Off Your Own
Head (It's a Doll Revolution)" make this stripped-to-essentials
collection (due Tuesday) an even more proper throwback to Costello's
late-'70s literate punk-new wave than 1994's "Brutal Youth" was.</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, he himself notes the preponderance of distorted
tremolo guitar, which pulses darkly through the shambling,
Dylan-esque title track and other numbers. But you can't entirely go
home again, and, really, who would want him to? All of Costello's
crooning years have honed his voice, making it more confident and
less strained, so agile that it has more punch than ever.</TE>
<TE>   And boy, does the ever-clever wordplay-meister punch. He turns
history and music 'round together in the thrashy-melodic "45,"
whispers a wry tale of mutual deception on "Spooky Girlfriend" and
vividly describes bittersweet on the airy "Tart." All this brings
back flashes of yesteryear, but our 21st century Elvis no longer
explodes with youthful rage. Rather, he slow-burns, muting fury with
amusement.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the angry buzz of "Daddy Can I Turn This?" cuts, but it's
the ballad "Alibi" that drips with magnificent disdain and reproach
for how we rationalize our transgressions. As fine as the music is,
it's Costello's voice, running breathlessly up and down the scale,
that gets the message across.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   CEE-LO</TE>
<TE>   "Cee-Lo Green and</TE>
<TE>   His Perfect Imperfections"</TE>
<TE>   Arista</TE>
<TE>   As a member of Atlanta's Goodie Mob and the larger Dungeon Family
hip-hop conglomerate (which includes hip-hop visionaries OutKast),
Cee-Lo has always included gospel, rock, rap and funk sensibilities
in his work. After venturing beyond the hip-hop world by appearing on
Santana's blockbuster album "Supernatural," the genre-bender emerges
with a knockout collection of his own.</TE>
<TE>   In the album (due Tuesday), Cee-Lo reaches out to rap fans ("Big
Ole Words [Damn]"), funk followers (the single "Closet Freak") and
rock aficionados ("Live [Right Now]") in consecutive cuts, showing
his artistic range. His jazz ("Base Head Jazz") and folk ("Country
Love," with Blues Traveler's John Popper on harmonica) offerings add
more styles to Cee-Lo's potpourri.</TE>
<TE>   Cee-Lo's clever lyrics about life's idiosyncrasies, his love for
music and the beauty of relationships breathe even more life into
this musically rich album. In "Young Man (Sierra's Song)," Cee-Lo
explains how the practice of referring to women in derogatory terms
can shoot ripples of pain through generations. This type of
commentary, insightful but never preachy, makes Cee-Lo a welcome
voice.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   ASHANTI</TE>
<TE>   "Ashanti"</TE>
<TE>   Murder Inc./Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   The next queen of hip-hop soul? Ashanti Douglas' debut album may
have topped the national sales chart, but don't be too quick to
depose Mary J. Blige. Sure, the 21-year-old singer-dancer-actress has
pricked up ears as the featured vocalist on Ja Rule's No. 1 hit
"Always on Time" and Fat Joe's almost equally monstrous "What's Luv?"
And her own chart-topping first single, the
he's-rotten-but-I-love-him "Foolish," has a reasonably enjoyable,
sparkly, modern soul-pop vibe.</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti's breathy, cooing vocals are well suited to the mellow
mood of this collection. She co-wrote everything except the solely
self-penned, extremely lightweight "Thank You." But the subjects
(breakups, booty calls and believe-in-your-dreams) and the production
are strictly Cliche City. Despite the seductive intimacy of her sweet
voice, "Ashanti" has nothing more substantial than that to prop up 17
tracks of essentially the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, several strictly unnecessary between-track skits take
a turn for the ugly with the "Fight" scene preceding "Over" (which
comes complete with ominous thunderstorm sounds in the mix).
Returning the favor, Ja Rule appears on "Leaving (Always on Time Part
II)," which at least creates some interesting textures with strings,
buzzing bass and acoustic guitar.</TE>
<TE>   --N.N</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2 Susana Baca, "Espiritu Vivo," Luaka Bop. The album's title,
which means Living Spirit, could refer to the chilling events that
haunted this vibrant recording, made in New York in the days
immediately following Sept. 11. But it also applies to the ancient
soul of Afro-Peruvian music, which takes on new life through Baca's
exquisitely enriched versions. The classic "Toro Mata" gains depth
and mystery with new choruses and eerie electronic embellishments,
while the celebratory "Se Me Van Los Pies" stirs up an unexpected
spell like a frenetic street rumba. Although it seems
self-consciously global at times, at the expense of some true criollo
flavor, this work stands as a shining, progressive contribution to
the genre.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   *** Brute, "Co-Balt," Widespread/Supercat. The members of
Widespread Panic who back Vic Chesnutt in this occasional
collaboration almost manage to make this most eccentric
singer-songwriter sound generic. Not that mainstreaming the cult hero
into John Hiatt territory is a bad career move. Besides, Chesnutt's
typically acerbic and sympathetic dispatches from the margins of
society carry their usual disquieting wallop and off-the-wall
originality. Chesnutt plays the Knitting Factory Hollywood on
Saturday to open the club's weeklong "Beat Fest."</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Eddie Palmieri "La Perfecta II," Concord Picante. Palmieri's
latest (due Tuesday) is partly a reprise of the pianist's glory days
fronting La Perfecta, the 1960s octet that stormed New York's
Palladium and set the stage for the salsa explosion of the 1970s. The
concept caught fire when performed live recently. On record, though,
it doesn't go beyond accomplished nostalgia, captured in a sparkling
recording. Six of the 11 tracks are new but predictable Latin jazz
compositions. Clearly, salsa's former enfant terrible needs to start
misbehaving musically again.</TE>

<LD>   DO I HEAR A WALTZ?</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena Playhouse production</LD>
<TE>   Fynsworth Alley with Varese Sarabande</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it helps to lower expectations. Since the initial
production of "Do I Hear a Waltz?" in 1965, its critics--including
two of its creators, lyricist Stephen Sondheim and librettist Arthur
Laurents--more or less consigned it to the scrap heap in their public
comments.</TE>
<TE>   So it wasn't too surprising that the 2001 revival at the Pasadena
Playhouse was better than many musical theater aficionados expected.
It hardly could have been worse than they expected.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the recorded score of the Pasadena version of "Do I
Hear a Waltz?," do I hear its faults?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but they're less apparent than they are in the
theater--again, because expectations are lower for a recording than
they are for a complete theatrical experience. We don't feel we have
to get so caught up in the plight of American tourist Leona Samish,
who is alone in Venice and tempted to have an affair with a married
stranger, if we can't actually see her or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Just on the basis of the music, the second half of the score by
Richard Rodgers and Sondheim is about five times more interesting
than the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the Moment" and the title song look back honorably to
Rodgers' better scores. "We're Gonna Be All Right" and "Perfectly
Lovely Couple" look forward to the jaunty-sounding but ironic lyrics
of the Sondheim musicals to come. "Everybody Loves Leona," which was
cut from the original production but restored for a 2000 production
in New Jersey and also used in Pasadena, looks back glancingly at
Mama Rose in "Gypsy" and forward to the Elaine Stritch character in
"Company."</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena cast--led by Alyson Reed, Anthony Crivello and Carol
Lawrence--sounds in character as well as in good voice, backed by
Steve Orich's 21-piece orchestra. The production's director David
Lee--better known as a co-creator of "Frasier"--wrote the informative
liner notes.</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   PINAFORE!</TE>
<TE>   Celebration Theatre production</TE>
<TE>   Belva Records</TE>
<TE>   Seldom is an L.A. cast album released while the show is still
playing, but that's the case with "Pinafore!," which opened in
September at the Celebration Theatre and has been extended several
times.</TE>
<TE>   Before listening to the "Pinafore!" CD, I glanced at the liner
notes for a recording of the original "H.M.S. Pinafore." The operetta
was the subject of "a spate of heavily adapted" American versions in
its early years, I learned, but more recently, it "has proved more
immune than other Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations to modernizing
trends."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that was then and this is now. "Pinafore!" adapter and
director Mark Savage kept most of the Sullivan score and even most of
the titles of the individual songs, but he radically changed most of
Gilbert's lyrics and character names.</TE>
<TE>   The ship in this version is part of the "separate but equal" gay
navy set up in response to the failed "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
The captain's son is a transvestite who has successfully convinced
his supposedly straight lover that he is a she. Yet the captain wants
to marry his offspring off to Sen. Barney Crank of Maryland, the
admiral of the gay navy.</TE>
<TE>   Savage aims his darts at politically correct liberals instead of
the usual right-wing targets of gay satires. Liberals are
automatically accorded the same privileges in the gay navy that
Englishmen were in the original, thereby making them fair game for
Savage's pen. In addition to suggesting that one ostensibly straight
character is really gay, Savage also suggests the opposite about
another character--which flies in the face of what happens in most
dramatizations of gay issues.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, this probably isn't a show for people with no
interest in gay culture--or indeed, with no interest in Gilbert and
Sullivan. Both groups may well not understand half of the jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The recording comes with a complete text of the lyrics, which
makes joke-appreciation even easier than it is in the theater. And it
preserves the multi-octave-spanning performance of R. Christofer
Sands as the transvestite, plus the performances of the amiable
Michael Gregory as the captain and Debra Lane as the secretly
troubled Bitter Butterball (as opposed to the original's Buttercup),
and the occasionally forced sounds of Christopher Hall as Dick
Dockstrap (as opposed to the original's Ralph Rackstraw). Ron Snyder
is the superb musical director.</TE>

<TE>   SO FAR...</TE>
<TE>   Susan Egan</TE>
<TE>   Jay Productions</TE>
<TE>   Susan Egan's first solo CD is called "So Far ..." because it takes
us through songs from some of the key roles she has played in her
career so far. However, in her song selection, she took care not to
repeat any of the numbers she previously recorded for her most famous
role, Belle in "Beauty and the Beast." So there are some less
predictable but sterling choices here.</TE>
<TE>   Because Egan was raised in Seal Beach and performed many of her
formative roles in the Southland, the selections may be more
predictable to locals than they are elsewhere. Her liner notes
identify where she sang some of these, from high school choir ("Much
More" from "The Fantasticks") to post-"Beauty and the Beast"
appearances with the Blank Theatre Company ("Tom" from "Hello,
Again"), at the Hollywood Bowl ("A Wonderful Guy" from "South
Pacific") and at the Mark Taper Forum ("Sooner or Later," originally
from "Dick Tracy," later from "Putting It Together").</TE>
<TE>   Wherever she sang them, the songs reflect a wide range, and Egan's
clear timbre and winsome style are evident throughout. The album
begins on an emotional high--"The Story Goes On" from "Baby," which
Egan's notes reveal was her audition song for "Beauty and the
Beast"--but the songs then take us through many other moods. The only
questionable choice is one that she reveals was dictated to her by
her producer, John Yap--"Just for Tonight," from "They're Playing Our
Song," which doesn't add much.</TE>
<TE>   "Beauty and the Beast" fans will be glad to hear that the show
hasn't been completely overlooked--Egan sings "A Change in Me," which
was added after she left the cast and after the cast album had been
recorded.</TE>
<TE>   *1/2</TE>
<TE>   ALL OF MY LIFE HAS LED TO THIS</TE>
<TE>   Louise Pitre</TE>
<TE>   LML Music</TE>
<TE>   Louise Pitre became a star in "Mamma Mia!" and may be nominated
for a Tony Award for it. Her performance was certainly one of the
best things about the ABBA musical, at least as it appeared last
spring at the Shubert Theatre in Century City.</TE>
<TE>   Her debut album, "All of My Life Has Led to This," isn't on the
same level. It showcases her vocal range at its weakest as well as
its strongest.</TE>
<TE>   Pitre is at her best in big, passionate numbers like "The Winner
Takes It All" from "Mamma Mia!," which she performs here in French as
well as in English. She makes quite a soulful production out of
"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby to a Dixie Melody," of all things. She performs
a couple of her own songs in French that conjure up world-weary
feelings about the vulnerability of love.</TE>
<TE>   But when she sings more delicate or sweeter fare, her voice is
ragged. She sounds like a singer who hasn't been able to make the
transition very well from big hall to recording studio.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   A QUIET THING</TE>
<TE>   Stan Chandler and Kirsten Benton</TE>
<TE>   LML Music</TE>
<TE>   Here are two singers who made the transition from theater to
studio exceptionally well: Stan Chandler and Kirsten Benton.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler, one of the original stars of "Forever Plaid," has become
one of Southland musical theater's most reliable leading men in
recent years. Benton hasn't achieved quite as high a profile, but she
has been in a number of smaller productions.</TE>
<TE>   In their liner notes for "A Quiet Thing," they write that they
discovered their voices were beautifully matched and then discovered
that their personalities were too--they're now married.</TE>
<TE>   The album's title is taken from the Kander-Ebb show tune. Pitre
sings the same song on her album, but here it's much more
appropriate, for Chandler and Benton know how to tone down the
belting and achieve an album that is truly a quiet thing--but also a
thing that shimmers from the purity of their harmonizing.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler's high range, well known from "Forever Plaid," here
launches the album with an ethereal version of the Lennon-McCartney
"I Will," which is then blended with Benton on "Maybe I'm Amazed."</TE>
<TE>   A more ambitious combination unites Sondheim's "Not a Day Goes
By," the Kander-Ebb "Sometimes a Day Goes By" and Jerry Herman's
"Time Heals Everything."</TE>
<TE>   Songs by Billy Joel, Lyle Lovett, Babbie Green and Rodgers and
Hart also appear.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Ellis' amusing arrangement of "Hey There" from "The Pajama
Game" reunites the four original Plaids as the doo-wop backup for
Benton's expert handling of the main melody--if there had been a
female Plaid, this version of the song could have been in "Forever
Plaid."</TE>
<TE>   Everything goes down smoothly, thanks in part to musical direction
by Scott Harlan and orchestrations by Steve Orich. The mellow
quotient is so high, it could become excessive. You almost feel as if
you've joined the couple on their honeymoon. But the album is only 41
minutes long. The singers-producers knew when to stop.</TE>
<TE>   **1/2</TE>
<TE>   MY FAVORITE THINGS</TE>
<TE>   Boston Pops Orchestra</TE>
<TE>   RCA Victor</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rodgers would have celebrated his 100th birthday in June,
so you'll hear a lot about the master melodist this year. The Boston
Pops Orchestra has recorded "My Favorite Things" (release date is
Wednesday), a mostly orchestral compilation of mostly familiar
material, but with a few less predictable items.</TE>
<TE>   Two tracks are billed as recording premieres--"March of the
Clowns" from "The Nursery Ballet" and the Paul Whiteman symphonic
version of "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" from "On Your Toes." However,
chances are that if you're at least, say, 30 years old, you've heard
the material within these selections in similar arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   John Williams' big-band arrangement of "The Surrey With the Fringe
on Top" jazzes up a song that's one of the most square in the Rodgers
oeuvre. Don Sebesky more conventionally arranged "Grant Avenue" and
"I Have Dreamed," the latter of which is one of the album's three
vocals, featuring the excellent Jason Danieley, best known for his
role in "The Full Monty" in San Diego and New York.</TE>
<TE>   The other vocals are experiments that don't pay off: country stars
Martina McBride in the album's title song and, worse, Collin Raye in
the title song from "The Sound of Music."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Lockhart is the conductor, and the orchestra sounds
terrific.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<LD>Southern California doesn't have the jazz singularity of New York
City. There can only be one Big Apple. Nor, for that matter, does it
have the territorial identity of some other cities--Chicago and
Kansas City as fountainheads of jazz-blues, New Orleans as the
genesis of it all.</LD>
<LD>   But Los Angeles does have Central Avenue, with the decades of
music and culture associated with that storied thoroughfare. It also
has jazz artists whose abilities are second to none. Do they get the
attention East Coast artists receive? With the exception of such
well-established national artists as Herbie Hancock, they generally
do not. So it's not surprising that many gifted young players, born
in the Southland, feel they must spend a few years in Manhattan to
institute some sort of connection to, and visibility in, the jazz
establishment.</LD>
<LD>   All of which makes it difficult for the many talented, mature
artists who live in the area. Record deals are difficult, if not
impossible, to come by--even more so in the current state of the
recording business. A remarkable number of players--many of whom are
gifted enough to be fully competitive with major name artists--have
had to display their wares on small record labels or by releasing
their own albums.</LD>
<TE>   How good are those often obscure CDs? Here's a sampling of some
current releases:</TE>
<TE>   Peter Erskine, Alan Pasqua, Dave Carpenter, "Badlands" (***1/2,
Fuzzy Music). The long-term relationship of these three veteran
artists shows in every beautifully integrated note of this superb
album. At first glance, the trio seems to have taken on a somewhat
daunting task--in terms of audience receptivity--by offering a
program consisting almost exclusively of originals by the members.
(The sole exception is the standard "You and the Night and the
Music.")</TE>
<TE>   But the selections--five by Pasqua, two each by Erskine and
Carpenter--unfold with such engaging musicality and the performance
level is so high that any question regarding the unfamiliarity of the
material becomes irrelevant. The interaction among the three players
is stunning, with Erskine's percussion and Carpenter's bass work
serving as integral musical elements rather than simple rhythmic
accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces have distinctly atmospheric qualities. Several of
pianist Pasqua's works--especially "Surrender" and "Daddy, What Is
God's Last Name" (with the latter sounding in places like a melodic
inversion of the former)--resonate with classical references. At its
best, the playing, individually and collectively, is a definitive
model of how far this classic instrumentation has come since the days
of the Bill Evans trios.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Mayer, "Full Circle" (***1/2, Reservoir Records). It's an
utter mystery why Mayer, 63, has not had a more visible career--even
though the pianist has recorded or performed with everyone from
Jackie McLean and John Coltrane to Chet Baker and Freddie Hubbard. A
consistently inventive player with a rich harmonic imagination and an
innately upbeat sense of swing, he is always a pleasure to hear. On
this album, perhaps because he was stimulated by recording in the
energetic surroundings of his native New York City with bassist Rufus
Reid and drummer Victor Lewis, he plays with even more density and
texture than in his local gigs.</TE>
<TE>   The album is filled with lofty achievements, among them a
beautifully harmonized rendering of "Stolen Moments" and a pensive
version of J.J. Johnson's "Lament." In a more upbeat vein, there are
highly energetic, rhythmically in-the-pocket romps through "Night and
Day" and "Falling in Love." Here too, echoes of Bill Evans are heard,
especially in Mayer's loose, swinging rendering of "I Should Care."
In this case, however, the association is not surprising, since Evans
and Mayer were in New York in the late '50s, exploring similar
musical territory, with Mayer eventually replacing Evans in the Tony
Scott Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Cunliffe, "The Bill Cunliffe Trio Live at Bernie's" (***,
Groove Note). No, the title does not refer to an appearance at a
mysterious Southland jazz venue. "Bernie's" is actually Bernie
Grundman Mastering Studio, a virtual Los Angeles shrine to record
mastering, but never before used for an actual recording. "Live"
identifies the process, in which pianist Cunliffe, with bassist Darek
Oleszkiewicz (sometimes known as Darek Oles) and drummer Joe La
Barbera, recorded live to disc. (There were actually dual
simultaneous recordings--an analog version for an eventual LP
release, and a digital version for CD and Super Audio CD).</TE>
<TE>   The upbeat tone of the album is set early in a groove-driven
version of Duke Ellington's "Satin Doll," followed by an unexpectedly
high-voltage reading of Evans' melodious "Waltz for Debby" (done in
4/4 rather than waltz time) and continuing with a brisk "The Way You
Look Tonight."</TE>
<TE>   But the most interesting aspect is the far-ranging choice of
material.</TE>
<TE>   In the mischievously titled "Amusing Paramours," Cunliffe
disguises a familiar standard by building his own tune on the chords
of "My Funny Valentine." Other numbers rarely heard in a jazz
setting: Rod McKuen's "Jean" and John Lennon's "Imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most interesting of all is the manner in which Cunliffe
captures the lyricism in a movement from Samuel Barber's "Excursions"
and the pensive qualities of his own "Ireland," honoring English
composer John Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Ferguson, "Jazz Union" (***, jazz/a/sance Records. Visit
Southland jazz clubs for a week or two, and it's very likely that
Ferguson--one of the area's A-list drummers--will be on stage at one
place or another. His popularity traces directly to his versatility
and his capacity to adapt to different musical settings. "Jazz
Union," his debut album as a leader, has similar strengths.</TE>
<TE>   There is, first of all, an attractive choice of repertoire, from
Johnny Griffin's funky "Callitwhachawanna" to a sensual arrangement
of Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life" revolving around Ferguson's soulful
mallet drumming. Oliver Nelson's "Black, Brown and Beautiful"
features well-crafted segments in which Louis Van Nelson's soprano
saxophone floats over Trevor Ware's bowed bass line.</TE>
<TE>   Each tune benefits from the surging rhythms of Ferguson's
percussion. The album peaks in the final track, "Spirit of Higgins,"
a stirring group improvisation dedicated to another great Southland
jazz drummer, the late Billy Higgins.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Baker, "Askew Two" (**1/2, Ranch Cabin Records, P.O. Box
1018, Glendale, CA 91209). Baker is a jazz rarity--a female bassist.
Her resume lists dozens of gigs and recordings in a variety of genres
with artists ranging from blues performers Willie Dixon and Lowell
Fulson to jazz artists Ricky Woodard and Oscar Brown Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The core of her second CD is the trio that includes pianist Phil
Wright and drummer Billy Paul. Baker's generally solid bass playing
is well displayed in the way she delivers the melody of "I'm
Beginning to See the Light" and an upbeat rendering of "Broadway" (in
which she has the opportunity to display a walking-bass style deeply
influenced by her teacher, the late great Red Callender).</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights include the guitar and vocal work of Earl
Alexander on "I Could Write a Book" and Baker's original "Earthquake
Blues," Suzanne Spinoza's lovely vocal rendering of another Baker
original, "Rain Dance," and Baker stepping up to the microphone to
sing a spirited version of "Sometimes I'm Happy."</TE>

<LD>In 1892, when the Czech composer Antonin Dvorak arrived in New York
to head the National Conservatory of Music, no one could say what
American music was. Typically, American classical composers studied
in Germany and wrote in a German style. But for Dvorak, a Bohemian
nationalist, the authentic voice of a new land was contained in the
songs of African Americans and Native Americans, and he wrote his
"New World" Symphony to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   The influence of America in that work, Dvorak insisted, could be
felt by anyone with a nose. "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" insinuates its
way into the first movement, and the poetic rhythms of Longfellow's
"The Song of Hiawatha" inspire later sections. But the "New World"
can just as easily strike the modern listener as token Americana
dressed up in European symphonic finery. A politically correct nose
smells appropriation not assimilation and certainly not authenticity.
Issues of appropriation, assimilation and authenticity are currently
being discussed at a weeklong Dvorak in America festival hosted by
Pacific Symphony in Orange County. It concludes Wednesday with the
"New World" Symphony combined with "Hiawatha."</LD>
<LD>   But the questions Dvorak raises also lie at the heart of much,
much more. Twentieth century music was launched with controversies
about assimilation; the 21st century continues to grapple with the
consequences.</LD>
<TE>   The way of nature is hybridization, contemporary dean of
multicultural California music Lou Harrison, likes to say, and
music--sonic sponge that it is--is a prime example. At the turn of
the last century, venturesome composers looked to borrowing as a way
to create something new. Debussy was bowled over by the metal gongs
and interlapping rhythms of the Javenese gamelan orchestra he heard
at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Mahler made room for street and
country sounds, and the ethnic Jewish music that pervaded his youth.
A little later, Bartok was fixated on Hungarian folk music, and
Stravinsky manipulated primitivistic Russian folk song. Then Leonard
Bernstein celebrated American popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   Now no one thinks twice about the melding of a culture or two. And
three CDs released in the last few weeks are giddy examples of
multiculturalism run amok. There is Yo-Yo Ma's exhilarating "Silk
Road Journeys: When Strangers Meet." It brings together 24 musical
"strangers" from places like China, central Asia, India and America.
John Williams' entrancing "The Magic Box" finds the classical (and
occasionally pop) guitarist in an easygoing jam with African
musicians. Meanwhile, the Kronos Quartet--been there, done that when
it comes to world-music collaboration, in "Caravan" (which explored
central Asia) and "Pieces of Africa"--has moved on to Mexico in its
sensationally inventive and joyous revel "Nuevo."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as influential as Debussy, Mahler and their compatriots
were at expanding classical conventions 100 years ago, and as
successful as the three new CDs are sure to be in this age (each is
probably headed up the Billboard charts), it would be naive to claim
that we are part of one happy world with music as its Esperanto.
Stravinsky's "primitivism" initially caused a riot; Bernstein's pop
influences were sneered at. In today's climate, too much assimilation
can lead to loss of identity. Too much agreement is not meaningful
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a Palestinian oud player, Khaled Jubran, had
angry words about the limits of assimilation for the Tel Aviv
newspaper Ha'aretz. Trained at the Rubin Academy of Music in
Jerusalem and now head of the department of Arabic music and theory
at the National Palestinian Conservatory of Music in Ramallah, he was
once known for his collaborations with Israeli musicians.</TE>
<TE>   But looking back, he now complains he was not being heard as an
individual. And he resents that when he performed alone, he was
invited because he was "exotic."</TE>
<TE>   "Some say music is an international language. It isn't," Jubran
told the Israeli newspaper. "It's the most culturally dependent thing
I know. Beethoven is German, and Debussy is the embodiment of
Frenchness ... and Abdul Wahab is Egyptian. Music has never brought
hearts closer. Certainly not the hearts of two nations that despise
each other."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, all Jubran wants is to be left alone. "We are the
Third World--there is poverty and leaders who are dictators. But when
the West comes with its money and cameras, the Third World starts to
go crazy and preens itself and tries to satisfy the other side. You
want to do something really effective? OK, let me first be who I am.
After that we'll be together."</TE>
<TE>   The multiyear, multinational Silk Road Project, with Ma as its
lead player, is precisely the kind of collaboration that could make a
Jubran suspicious. Its stated mission is to make music a means of
cooperation and understanding between cultures. For funding, it
relies upon the Aga Khan Foundation, Ford Motor Co., Siemens and Sony
Classical. It is a commercial venture: The new CD is being heavily
promoted, and the project, in one form or another, has been on the
road all over the world for a year and a half (a week of Silk Road
events began in Berkeley on Friday; Carnegie Hall is next; then it
lands in Seattle and in early summer at the Smithsonian Folklife
Festival in Washington, D.C.). The restless Ma has a track record for
trivializing what he champions, leaping from one crossover
bandwagon--tango, bluegrass, early music, sentimental movie music--to
another.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the CD shows that the Silk Road Project is genuinely
discovering what musical cultures have in common. Ma chose well when
he tapped Dartmouth ethnomusicologist Theodore Levin, author of an
illuminating book, "The Hundred Thousand Fools of God: Musical
Travels in Central Asia (and Queens, New York)," as the project's
artistic director. In his extended visits to Tashkent, Bukhara and
other parts of Uzbekistan as well as Tajikistan, Kyrgysztan and
Kazakhstan, Levin discovered over and over that musical traditions
are artificial solids made from fluid material. One revelation in
fluidity and never-ending assimilation: The beginnings of formal
Arabic music theory, in the 10th century, and the style of Arabic
performance handed down through the centuries may well have their
origins in Greek musical texts translated into Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "Silk Road Journeys" celebrates such commonality by including
cosmopolitan musicians with a wide range of interests and a
consistently high level of virtuosity. Iranian composer Kayhan
Kalhor, Azerbaijani composer and pianist Franghiz Ali-Zadeh, Chinese
pipa player Wu Man will already be familiar to Kronos followers. One
Chinese composer in the mix, Zhao Jiping, wrote the music for the
films "Farewell My Concubine" and "Raise the Red Lantern." Such eager
virtuosos offer composers of all stripes a world of possibilities.
The main impression of the CD is that almost anything goes, whether
it is new music by Silk Road composers, traditional music, Western
classical music reinterpreted or anything in between.</TE>
<TE>   Ali-Zadeh, for instance, re-creates with astonishing naturalness
native Azerbaijan music in a duet for cello and prepared piano, an
instrument invented in Seattle in 1940 by John Cage. The CD ends with
a spirited rendition of a Renaissance Italian madrigal played on Silk
Road instruments, and the sound is closer to that of period Western
instruments than to modern Western ones. The results, like Levin's
research, stand notions of authenticity on their head.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Williams' friendly African guitar safari is really no
adventure at all. With pioneers such as Paul Simon and Kronos, we've
long known how well Western and African musics get along. The
international musical language of pop, and before that jazz, has its
deepest roots in the African soil.</TE>
<TE>   Both CDs display admirable mutual trust and respect (to say
nothing of gainful employment) among the participants. The Silk
Roadies have the benefit of Levin's scholarship about what links
these cultures. Williams has the benefit of building on long-broken
ground. The collaborators are friendly strangers, not suspicious
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   But even in these best of circumstances, such arranged musical
marriages are still too artificial to give the likes of Jubran much
comfort. There is no escaping that Ma and Williams, though hardly
cultural imperialists, nevertheless appear to give other cultures the
"benefit" of their gorgeous, plush tones. There is no escaping the
sonic--and celebrity--glamour they add to their projects.</TE>
<TE>   Is there no means by which fragile identities can remain fully
intact through the process of cultural mediation? Yes, and that is
where Kronos' "Nuevo" comes in, as does a surprising side effect of
Dvorak's trip to America.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Dvorak's influence on America was mostly lamentable
appropriation, leading as it did to the creation of an American
"Indianist" school, leaving a legacy of such kitsch as Charles
Wakefield Cadman's "In the Land of Sky Blue Water." But it also
spawned one American original, Arthur Farwell, a composer and music
collector whose work was on the Dvorak in America program Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Horowitz, the festival's artistic consultant, calls Farwell
"the first composer of prominence to articulate the idea that it
wasn't enough to be an American composer without thinking about what
that meant. An American composer had to consciously sound American."</TE>
<TE>   Farwell was the Indianist who put real thought into what that
meant. And although mostly forgotten today and thought of as
something of a crank in his own day, he actually sowed the seeds for
such projects as "Nuevo."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the other Indianists, he didn't dress up the sound of a
Native American war dance with pleasant Viennese harmonies. He was an
outright preservationist who attempted to be true to the spirit of
complex work. Horowitz calls him the "American Bartok."</TE>
<TE>   Farwell's interests extended beyond Native American music. On a
1904 lecture tour, Farwell, who was born in Massachusetts in 1872,
visited Los Angeles, where he met Charles Lummis, a journalist who
had become obsessed with recording the Spanish songs of old
California on wax cylinders.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to these trailblazing efforts in field recording,
Farwell discovered a sensuality and formal freedom entirely different
from the American folk music he knew. Rather than try to Anglicize
the Spanish songs into the traditional boxy phrase structures of
American song, he astutely transcribed the recordings and published
the songs in the collection "Spanish Songs of Old California."</TE>
<TE>   Although Farwell died in obscurity in 1952 and his music awaits
revival, his influence pervades our lives--he helped found the
Hollywood Bowl, and he spent a year in Berkeley, where he had an
impact on the fledgling studies of world music there that would later
influence composer Henry Cowell (who would go on to influence
Harrison) and whose own extensive efforts at combining global styles
makes him the father of the world music movement.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit of Farwell pervades "Nuevo," as the Kronos Quartet, in
one of the most exciting and original recordings of its
ever-venturesome career, takes the next important step in viable
cultural intermarriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Nuevo," a panoramic view of Mexican music during the past 100
years, is a riotous festival of individuality. Kronos' members have
always sought out music that was new and unusual to their ears, the
stranger the better, and "Nuevo" celebrates otherness in every
possible meaning of the word. The CD selections are not musics that
get along with each other--they range, after all, from mariachi to
Silvestre Revueltas to TV show themes to Juan Garcia Esquivel's
lecherous ping-ponging bachelor-pad soundtracks from the 1950s to
Carlo Garcia, a one-armed street musician who plays "Perfidia" on a
buzzing leaf with such haunting sweetness that it breaks your heart.</TE>
<TE>   What we find on this compulsively listenable CD is no attempt at
explanation, and no sign of collaboration in the usual sense.
Instead, it's pure, unconditional love. Kronos, giving its voice over
entirely to the needs of each piece, insists that we love music
whatever its form--avant-garde experiment, raucous pop or the
saccharine soul of 101 Strings.</TE>
<TE>   Behind much of "Nuevo" lies the arrangements of Osvaldo Golijov.
Ever more, this Argentine-born American composer is coming to
represent, along with Chinese-born American Tan Dun, the hope for a
new global music of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Listen to an original piece for string quartet and marimba he
contributes to "Nuevo." "Festival for the Holy Mother Guadalupe" is a
dreamy, spectral music overlaid with a 1970 field recording of an
Indian ritual made in the town of Chamula. The strings contribute a
warm, spiritual voice, heir to Dvorak. The rolling marimba adds a
more conventionally Mexican flavor. The field recording makes it seem
part of the real world, while the Indians' quiet religious ardor also
takes it out of this world.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, "Festival for the Holy Mother Guadalupe" will provide
the soundtrack for a new theater piece-video that Peter Sellars is
developing for the Vienna Festival. Sellars sees it as an examination
of the American war in Afghanistan, and makes use of awesomely
demented texts on American cultural aggression by the late French
avant-garde writer and theatrical revolutionary Antonin Artaud. And
so the world circles back to the Silk Road via an improbable journey
through Mexico, California, France and Vienna. With its radically
demonstrative embrace of Mexico's music in "Nuevo," global music has
turned a corner that leaves the concepts of assimilation,
authenticity and appropriation back in the previous century. Where it
leads no one knows.</TE>
<TE>   But don't even think about turning back.</TE>

<HD>It's the Other Football Season</HD>
<DH>Colleges: Spring practice could help some teams answer
serious questions before they break camp for summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM DIENHART</AU>
<BD>SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The calendar says spring, but the pressure of another season already
is in the air around Boston College's Tom O'Brien. His daunting task
is to find a replacement for running back William Green, who left
college a year early after ranking second in the nation with 155.9
yards rushing per game.</LD>
<LD>   O'Brien knows he doesn't have another Green on campus. But he does
have three players who, among them, might be able to meet the
standards of the Eagles' traditionally strong rushing attack. O'Brien
is counting on junior Derrick Knight, junior Horace Dodd and
sophomore Brandon Brokaw.</LD>
<LD>   All three bring something different to the field. Knight is the
fastest and most experienced. Dodd, a transfer from Penn State who is
getting reacclimated to the position after playing defense his last
year in State College, is a slasher. At 6-3, 240 pounds, Brokaw is
the biggest of the trio. He has excellent vision and good north-south
skills. For now, Knight is running No. 1, but expect Boston College
to use all three this fall.</LD>
<TE>   "We won't modify the offense," O'Brien says, "but we won't have a
guy carry it 25 to 30 times a game like Green. You may see two
players share the load and each carry 15 to 20 times a game."</TE>
<TE>   The tailback competition at Boston College is one of several
important position battles around the nation this spring--the best of
which are taking place on the offensive side of the ball:</TE>
<TE>   * Auburn quarterback. The Tigers have concluded spring drills but
are no closer to determining their starter. Senior Daniel Cobb, who
began his career at Georgia, and sophomore Jason Campbell will resume
their battle in August. In the spring, inconsistency plagued both.
Physically, there's little difference between them; both are
strong-armed and athletic. Whoever starts won't be asked to do too
much through the air because Auburn wants to pound foes.</TE>
<TE>   * Illinois quarterback. Juniors Jon Beutjer and Dustin Ward are
fighting to take over for record-setting Kurt Kittner. Beutjer, a
transfer from Iowa who started four games for the Hawkeyes, is
playing catch-up in learning the offense after sitting out last year.
What he lacks in knowledge compared with Ward, the long and lean
Beutjer makes up for in superior skills. Beutjer has a slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   * LSU quarterback. If the Tigers want to repeat as SEC champs,
they must find a replacement for Rohan Davey. Sophomores Matt Mauck
and Marcus Randall, both good athletes, are tussling for the job.
Expect Mauck to win the spot based on his experience. You also can
expect LSU to be unable to attack downfield as it did with Davey
because neither Mauck nor Randall throws particularly well.</TE>
<TE>   * Maryland quarterback. The departed Shaun Hill wasn't physically
gifted, but he limited mistakes and always put the Terrapins in
position to succeed. Those will be the marching orders for his
successor, who will come from the triumvirate of Chris Kelley, Scott
McBrien and junior college transfer Orlando Evans. Kelley, a 6-2,
200-pound sophomore, is one of Maryland's most decorated recruits
ever, but he has been beset by injuries. Nevertheless, the
ultra-competitive Kelley is in the lead and figures to win the job.</TE>
<TE>   * Michigan running back. The Wolverines weren't able to fill the
void left by Anthony Thomas last year, so the search continues.
Redshirt freshman Kelly Baraka, sophomores Tim Bracken and David
Underwood and junior Chris Perry are in contention. The foursome
offers a blend of speed and power. Baraka and Bracken have the
wheels; Perry and Underwood are built to move the pile. B.J. Askew
also returns, but he has been moved back to fullback after getting
considerable time at tailback in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * Notre Dame quarterback. The Irish have only a few spring
practices under their belt, so junior quarterbacks Carlyle Holiday,
Jared Clark and Matt LoVecchio are just beginning to implement the
intricacies of new Coach Tyrone Willingham's West Coast offense. One
thing is certain: The quarterback who is best able to instantly
analyze a defense and find the open receiver will have the best
chance to start. Those close to the program say there's no
front-runner at this point, which means a decision on a starter
likely won't be made until late August.</TE>
<TE>   * Ohio State running back. With Jonathan Wells gone, there are
plenty of carries available in the Buckeyes' backfield. For now, it's
a four-way race among sophomores Lydell Ross and Maurice Hall,
redshirt freshman JaJa Riley and true freshman Maurice Clarett, who
already is on campus after graduating early. Expect a committee
effort in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee running back. The choice among Jabari Davis, Cedric
Houston and Derrick Tinsley might not be made until the fall, when
it's possible coaches will develop some type of rotation. Another guy
in the picture is fullback Troy Fleming, who has looked good working
out of a one-back set in the spring. If a No. 1 guy had to be
identified today, coaches would tab the bullish Davis, who has run
with purpose all spring.</TE>
<TE>   For a handful of major programs, position battles aren't the No. 1
issue this spring. Adjusting to the teachings of new coordinators is.
Some switches were more significant than others:</TE>
<TE>   * Auburn. Tiger Coach Tommy Tuberville changed both
coordinators--and his team shared the SEC West title last season!
Sort of gives you an idea of the type of pressure Tuberville is
under.</TE>
<TE>   With Noel Mazzone gone and Bob Petrino on board from the NFL,
where he coordinated the Jacksonville Jaguars' offense, look for the
Tigers to employ more two-back, two-tight-end sets after mostly
featuring a one-back look under Mazzone. Auburn wants to get more
physical and pound the ball with its cache of strong running backs,
which includes Carnell "Cadillac" Williams, Ronnie Brown, Chris
Butler and Casinious Moore. Something is needed after the offense
ranked 73rd in the nation last year in yardage per game.</TE>
<TE>   Under Gene Chizik, who takes over for John Lovett after running
Central Florida's defense, the Auburn defense will become more
aggressive and attack more after allowing 349 yards per game in a
read-and-react scheme in 2001. Chizik will use a 4-3 set to feature a
talented corps of linebackers led by Lemarcus Rowell and Dontarrious
Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   * Clemson. Lovett arrives from Auburn to run the defense. He'll
employ an aggressive scheme that will feature more blitzing and
attacking than former coordinator Reggie Herring used. It should lead
to improvement for a unit that ranked 71st (390 yards per game) in
2001. Lovett, who will have eight returning starters, figures to have
a big impact on the secondary, which has been a weak spot in recent
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Mississippi. It's an annual struggle at Ole Miss to find big
guys to stuff the run. Last year, the Rebels were 105th in the nation
in rushing defense, allowing 214 yards per game.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Driesbach has arrived from TCU to attempt to stop the
bleeding. He'll use a 4-2-5 alignment that will allow the Rebels to
walk safeties Matt Grier and Von Hutchins toward the line. If Ole
Miss, which initially hired Herring (before he bolted to become an
assistant with the Houston Texans), can't outmuscle foes, it will try
to outnumber them at the point of attack.</TE>

<HD>Late Recruits Can Put Teams Over Top</HD>
<DH>College basketball: The spring signing period takes a back
seat to early commitments, but coaches know value of recruiting
year-round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DECOURCY</AU>
<BD>SPORTING NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the spring signing period still were a big deal, it's unlikely the
biggest recruiting news of the week would have been made by a
prospect who can't sign a letter of intent for another seven months:
junior point guard Brandon Cotton of Detroit committed to Michigan
State.</LD>
<LD>   Recruiting analyst Dave Telep says if it weren't for club
tournaments that must be scouted, he figures he could squeeze a
vacation into the first few weeks of April.</LD>
<LD>   But spring's importance to those who follow recruiting and its
importance to college teams are different matters. Late additions
were crucial to some of last season's most successful teams,
including Pittsburgh (Ontario Lett), Kent State (Antonio Gates),
Oklahoma (Ebi Ere) and Connecticut (Emeka Okafor).</LD>
<TE>   Several of this spring's recruits also figure to affect their
college teams next season--one way or another:</TE>
<TE>   * Kelenna Azubuike, wing, Kentucky: Azubuike is a terrific
student, is bright and engaging and probably is an underrated player.
That is, if you don't include Azubuike's family members among those
doing the rating.</TE>
<TE>   They have talked openly about the possibility of Azubuike entering
the NBA draft out of high school since his junior year at Victory
Christian in Tulsa, Okla.</TE>
<TE>   That was one reason Azubuike was rated in the 30s and 40s among
high school seniors and was not chosen for the McDonald's
All-American Game. Prep scouts thought the NBA talk was laughable and
were bothered by what they perceived as me-first plays attempted
merely to show off his talent.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky has had no shortage of players whose regard for their
skills exceeded reality, whether it was Keith Bogans thinking he was
an NBA player or Rashaad Carruth believing he did not need to follow
instructions to get playing time. Azubuike could compound that
problem or alleviate it. He's not a great shooter, despite a 39.1
scoring average as a senior, but he is a promising passer who could
create plays for teammates.</TE>
<TE>   * Aaron Spears, power forward, Illinois. Last summer, Spears was a
doughy, 6-9, 280-pounder who struggled to move against quicker
opponents. He since has lost nearly 40 pounds and averaged 27 points
and 15 rebounds for Chicago's Dunbar High.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a great set of hands," says analyst Van Coleman of the
FutureStars recruiting service. "If you add hops and movement to
that, Spears gives Illinois something they don't have: somebody who
can go inside and use his body."</TE>
<TE>   Recruit Kevin Augustine is a great shooter but needs time to grow
into a big man's body. Returnees Brian Cook and Nick Smith are not
overpowering. Spears gives the Illini some weight up front--but,
fortunately, not too much.</TE>
<TE>   * Andre Iguodala, shooting guard, Arizona. Though he signed in the
fall with Arkansas, Iguodala became available when he was released
from his commitment after Razorback Coach Nolan Richardson was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Iguodala joins Hassan Adams of Westchester to form the best pair
of freshman wings in any program. Though he sometimes struggled to
score as a junior at Lanphier High in Springfield, Ill., Iguodala
emerged as a superior athlete and jump shooter during the Nike
All-American Camp and was essential to the Illinois Warriors'
national AAU championship.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's primary problem will be finding time for those two and
fellow freshman Chris Rodgers given that young perimeter players
Salim Stoudamire and Will Bynum and senior Jason Gardner already are
in place.</TE>
<TE>   * Ricky Clemons, point guard, Missouri. Wesley Stokes proved
during his sophomore year what he already had proved as a freshman:
He's a terrific backup. He is a high-energy player whose value begins
to decline if asked to play more than 20-22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes can work to change that this off-season, but he'll have to
improve plenty to hold off Clemons, who averaged 18.2 points, 7.5
assists and shot 39.5 percent from 3-point range for a 26-6 team at
the College of Southern Idaho. With all the Tigers will have going
for them next season they can't afford to miss at the point.</TE>

<HD>Top-Seeded Teams Not Always Clear Favorites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WILBON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never before have the top seeds in the NBA and NHL had more reason to
fear for their playoff lives from the very first night of the
postseason.</LD>
<LD>   The best team in the NHL, the Detroit Red Wings, which is a squad
loaded with at least a half-dozen future Hall of Famers, is already
down two games to the eighth-seeded Vancouver Canucks.</LD>
<LD>   Just days into the Stanley Cup playoffs, perhaps it's best to
dismiss the notion that there's a favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, in the NBA the Sacramento Kings may be the No. 1 seed,
but they've drawn the toughest out imaginable in the Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the playoffs lack in greatness, they should more than
make up for in suspense. It's as easy to make a case for the No. 6
seed in the NHL's Eastern Conference--New Jersey--as it is for No.
1-seeded Boston.</TE>
<TE>   If Allen Iverson returns, it's as easy to make a case for the No.
6 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference--Philly--as it is for No. 1
seed New Jersey, most of whose players have little if any playoff
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Who in his right mind can actually pick a favorite in the NBA's
Eastern Conference with any confidence?</TE>
<TE>   You want to pick the Nets? Based on what, one impressive regular
season? Based on Jason Kidd, who's won exactly one playoff series in
seven NBA seasons?</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey's first-round opponent, Indiana, made the playoffs only
because the Milwaukee Bucks played like mutts over the last month,
but the Pacers could certainly win this series. The Pacers have the
proven playoff star (Reggie Miller) the Nets don't have, and what
appears to be an advantage in the frontcourt (Jermaine O'Neal, Brad
Miller, Ron Artest, Jeff Foster). Just when it looked as if the
Pacers were going to finish the regular season as the most
disappointing team in the league, they won five consecutive and are
starting to look like the team I picked two months ago to win the
Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Detroit won its division and is the No. 2 seed, do we
really think a playoff-tested team such as Toronto, having won 12 of
14, is incapable of beating the Pistons, who have about as many
playoff-tested players as New Jersey? Any and every team in the East
could go to the Finals, including Charlotte, and wouldn't that be a
great story line considering the NBA could announce any day now that
the Hornets will be moving to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics could be back in the Finals for all we know. Every
game should be dramatic because every team legitimately thinks it can
win the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Since not a single one of the NBA's Eastern Conference teams could
crack the top six out West, let's immediately move to the West. First
postseason declaration: The Spurs, though they won the Midwest
Division, will struggle with a young, athletic, go-for-broke Seattle
team. It's never good for a rookie (in this case Tony Parker) to be
matched up with crafty, cantankerous Gary Payton.</TE>
<TE>   The only disappointing thing about the West is the way the seeds
played out. Wouldn't you love to see Dallas against the Lakers in the
second round so we could see Don Nelson employ his run-and-gun
strategy against Shaq?</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that Nellie's attempt to score 120 points a game
against L.A. is both seriously flawed and totally brilliant. Nobody's
going to beat the Lakers the straight-up, traditional, half-court way
so why not do something radical? Instead, though, we'll probably get
Sacramento vs. Dallas in the second round and the Lakers licking
their lips for another shot at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   If we really want to see the Lakers tested, the toughest road
would have them going through Portland, Dallas and then Sacramento,
which now cannot happen. But presuming the top four seeds advance in
the West, we at least will be treated eventually to Lakers vs. Kings
or Lakers vs. Dallas in the Western Conference finals, the de facto
NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   What can derail the Lakers in their attempt to threepeat?
Injuries. L.A. will have suffered a major blow if Robert Horry--he
saves his best for the playoffs every year--has to miss any time
because of an abdominal injury he suffered Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers of Shaq and Kobe ought not be mentioned with the Bulls
of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen because the Lakers spent so much
time laboring through the regular season, as if it were a necessary
evil. Even so, the Lakers should be safe as long as Shaq and Kobe
remain healthy. Opening against Sacramento or San Antonio on the road
would mean little in the way of a disadvantage. "I just found out
today we finished two games better than we did last year," Shaq said
Wednesday night. "The only teams we had problems with were the lesser
teams, who aren't in the playoffs. It's party time now."</TE>
<TE>   No team in the NHL can feel that good about its chances, not the
defending champion Avalanche, not the No. 1-seeded Red Wings. Only
five points separated the second-seeded team in the West, Colorado,
from the eighth-seeded team, Vancouver. Wednesday night in the
playoff openers, two underdogs--Vancouver and Carolina--won on the
road. Vancouver, after beating Detroit in Games 1 and 2, is now
undefeated in its last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Islanders, having righted themselves the final three
weeks of the season, look to have as good a chance of getting to the
Stanley Cup finals as Boston or Philly.</TE>
<TE>   What this amounts to even more than usual is looking into your
crystal ball and correctly picking which goaltender is going to be
the hottest between now and the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Will it be Detroit's Dominic Hasek, whose desire to win a
championship before retiring led him to Detroit, but who has been
deep into the playoffs only once (1999)?</TE>
<TE>   Will it be Colorado's Patrick Roy, who says he had his best
regular season in years and should be fresh from not going to the
Winter Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   Will Felix Potvin be able to lead the L.A. Kings past Colorado,
which ought to be bolstered by the return of Peter Forsberg?</TE>
<TE>   Will Boston's Byron Dafoe hold his own against Montreal's Jose
Theodore?</TE>
<TE>   Is Toronto's Curtis Joseph ready to reach the Finals for the first
time in his career?</TE>
<TE>   Can New Jersey's Martin Brodeur stay on a roll from the Winter
Olympics straight through the playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in June a big championship party will commence.</TE>
<TE>   I like Colorado and New Jersey to make the NHL's half, the Detroit
Pistons and, once again, the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA.</TE>

<LD>Dean Kuipers' article indicates a new creativity emerging in Japanese
popular music ("Made in Japan," March 31). This is both a welcome
sign and perhaps no big surprise. Although I am an artist living in
Tokyo (and previously a New York-based electronic music composer), I
am not familiar with this music. But I found it significant that with
both Buffalo Daughter and Cornelius, the word "nowhere" figures
prominently, ostensibly in the sense that their latest music is not
borrowed from other music from anywhere in particular, that it is
more original (and that this is newsworthy).</LD>
<LD>   Painting may reveal a deeper significance to this reference.
Traditionally, Western art has always been about somewhere,
pioneering such "realisms" as Renaissance perspective, chiaroscuro's
dramatic solidity, or Impressionism's naturalistic light and color.
Japanese painting traditionally has never felt obligated to defer to
"reality" in such a sensible, imitative manner. The featured
"subject" might just as likely be the part of the paper the artist
didn't touch. But more than being merely blank, such areas could more
accurately be characterized as a dynamic void, a nothing that is
charged with creative possibility.</LD>
<TE>   Japanese artists arrive bearing music from nowhere, and critics
laud the originality. That much of modern Japanese culture is
imitative is not news. That the Japanese are a creative, highly
unique people shouldn't be news. Much labeled as "imitation" is
symptomatic of a general westernization of the world. And while this
globe is becoming smaller, more the same everywhere, it also feels
less complete, less balanced in its predominantly outward focus.
Right about now, music from nowhere sounds pretty good to me.</TE>

<HD>Building Inner-City Equity</HD>
<DH>A decade after the L.A. riots, a new financial order is
directing more investment dollars to low-income areas as nonprofit
groups act as intermediaries between capital and communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major development in the 10 years since the Los Angeles riots is
that everyone connected with the economy of the inner city--bankers,
businesspeople, church groups and economic development
organizations--has gone from promising charity to directing capital
investment for small- business expansion and homeownership for the
poor.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhoods torn by riots a decade ago may not show dramatic
improvement yet, but more capital investment and mortgage financing
have become available to low-income areas in the last few years.</LD>
<LD>   The efforts are serious business: Institutional investors, private
equity firms and other big players are finally beginning to invest in
minority businesses and urban areas, and are expecting market rate
returns. Government programs are pushing the new approach, but mostly
it results from the need to invest the funds in enormous pension and
individual retirement accounts that swelled in the economic and stock
market booms of the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   As a consequence, a new financial order is taking hold in the
inner city. If such investments, only now beginning to gain momentum,
create new homeowners and help minority entrepreneurs, Los Angeles
and other areas of Southern California will tell a different story 10
years hence--if a 20-year anniversary is marked to recall the days of
rage and violence of 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, trends are mostly up. Homeownership has increased very
little among low-income residents of South-Central Los Angeles,
partly due to a sheer lack of available housing.</TE>
<TE>   But mortgage loans are on the rise from major banks and savings
associations--fulfilling their government-mandated duty to lend in
distressed areas, with help from such church groups as FAME
Renaissance Center, the development arm of the First African
Methodist Episcopal Church, and West Angeles Development Corp., the
economic assistance effort of the West Angeles Church of God in
Christ, and from nonprofit organizations such as Operation Hope and
the Greenlining Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The church organizations educate poor families about applying for
and maintaining mortgage loans and establishing good credit ratings.
Homeownership is doubly important to the inner-city economy because a
residential property can be used to raise capital to start a
business.</TE>
<TE>   In the area of business creation, minority entrepreneurs and urban
areas are getting more respect from investors these days. There are
ambitious programs, including a $1-billion effort led by state
Treasurer Philip Angelides and the state's public pension funds to
make capital available to inner-city businesses and real estate
projects.</TE>
<TE>   The "emerging market" of America's inner cities has become a
fashionable subject, from the think tanks of Harvard Business School
to Southern California's Milken Institute, which is working with
development organizations in Los Angeles. Basically, economists see
large populations in the nation's central cities as investment
targets with fewer risks than projects in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional investors are organizing funds to invest in and lend
to minority-owned companies. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for example, raised
a $77-million fund four years ago for home mortgages and business
investments. Now it has attracted investors to a new $159-million
fund for investments and loans to minority businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Yucaipa Cos., the private equity investment firm of Los Angeles
supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, is authorized to invest $200 million
of California Public Employees' Retirement System funds in low-income
communities. Yucaipa recently hired former President Clinton to
advise it on such investments, which are eligible for tax breaks
under the federal New Markets Tax Credits program that became law
during Clinton's term.</TE>
<TE>   The companies of Earvin "Magic" Johnson are investing more than
$200 million in shopping center projects in Southern California and
nationwide. Former basketball great Johnson also is a co-owner of
Founders Bank of Commerce, now the largest African American-owned
bank in the country after the merger in 2001 of Los Angeles' Founders
Bank with Boston's Bank of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to "more capital on the table for minority
entrepreneurs and a greater openness to lending to minority-owned and
urban-area businesses," says Brian Argrett, managing partner of
Fulcrum Capital Management, a 10-year-old Culver City firm that has
brought about $40 million in equity investments to small local
companies.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean poor neighborhoods are suddenly booming.
Nationally, less than 2% of the $2 billion a year in private equity
investments by pension and mutual funds goes into minority
neighborhoods. And Los Angeles trails even that average.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a huge gap here in Los Angeles between supply and demand
as it relates to equity capital targeting minority enterprises,"
Argrett says.</TE>
<TE>   Early Investment in Projects Hard to Find</TE>
<TE>   Developer Chris Hammond, who built the Chesterfield Square
shopping center, the first major center to open in South-Central Los
Angeles in a decade, says investment at early stages of inner-city
projects is hard to come by because many financial firms find high
returns more easily elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   And Bob Gnaizda, president of Greenlining Institute, a San
Francisco-based nonprofit backed by church and civic groups,
complains that environmental and bureaucratic municipal restrictions
are causing a severe housing shortage in Los Angeles, keeping renters
who can afford to buy from achieving homeownership.</TE>
<TE>   Still, compared with 10 years ago--or with the decades following
the Watts riots in 1965--the region's inner cities offer a more
dynamic story.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis Gordon is an example. A former officer of Founders Bank,
Gordon and fellow banker Peter Barash set up a small-business
investment company in 1997 to give advice on capital access and
financial management to minority businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, entrepreneur Mike Archibong brought them a chance to
acquire Chemrich Laboratories Inc., a 30-year-old Los Angeles firm
that was doing $1.4 million in annual sales making private-label
equivalents of popular remedies, such as Pepto-Bismol, Ny Quil and
Robitussin, for 7-Eleven and other convenience chains.</TE>
<TE>   With $1 million in financing from Fulcrum Capital and Merrill
Lynch, and their own investments, Gordon and Barash bought Chemrich.
"It's a business with upside potential," Gordon explains, because
Chemrich's former owner hadn't wanted to expand the business, "and we
are forced to grow because we have interest to pay and [investment]
returns to make."</TE>
<TE>   A tiny firm such as Chemrich, which with 15 employees operates
below the radar screen of the larger suppliers to big grocery chains,
exemplifies the needs of minority-owned firms and the difficulties of
investing in them, Gordon says.</TE>
<TE>   "Most finance companies won't take the time and trouble to deal
with such small companies."</TE>
<TE>   Those difficulties are one reason major banks failed so badly in
their attempts to get money to local stores and businesses in the
wake of the 1992 riots. Gordon, who worked at Founders Bank in those
days, recalls "heady times."</TE>
<TE>   "We would have meetings with major lenders at 7 in the morning
until 9 at night, trying to come up with projects and financing," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   But not much happened because potential borrowers weren't big or
sophisticated enough to qualify and major lenders weren't flexible
enough to make the loans.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, large investment companies, such as Shamrock Partners
and Yucaipa, often have targets beyond the capacity of most
inner-city firms. Yucaipa, for example, is looking to invest $10
million to $25 million in bigger companies, such as minority-owned
auto parts suppliers. Shamrock is looking to invest $2 million to $10
million in short-term financing in real estate projects in Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Such investments will help boost the general availability of
capital in underserved communities.</TE>
<TE>   But for small companies, the flexibility and expertise of local
banks, church organizations and investment companies such as Fulcrum
Capital are needed as go- betweens.</TE>
<TE>   "Access to capital is often a function of sophistication and
relationships," says Argrett, who has degrees in law and business
administration from UC Berkeley. He cites Si-Nor Inc., a trash
removal and recycling company in which Fulcrum, along with Merrill
Lynch, has invested several million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   When Fulcrum came in contact with Si-Nor two years ago,
entrepreneur Silas Ugorji, an immigrant from Nigeria, had
trash-hauling operations in several states and $4.9 million in annual
revenue. But he had no financial relationships beyond checking
accounts in a number of banks.</TE>
<TE>   So Fulcrum Capital partners went with Ugorji to major bankers,
showed Si-Nor's financial statements and business plan and arranged
more reliable financing. Today, the firm, based in Rialto in San
Bernardino County, has grown to $14 million in annual revenue and is
contemplating acquisitions for further growth.</TE>
<TE>   Ugorji now owns about 75% of his company, and Fulcrum and its
institutional investment partners own about 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "We bridge the gaps between minority-owned companies and today's
capital markets," Argrett says, referring to the vast amounts of
private investment capital available in the U.S. financial system.</TE>
<TE>   A shift has occurred in recent years that directly affects
inner-city economies. Banks, for many reasons, have had to cut back
lending to all borrowers, Argrett says. But private equity investing
has "exploded" because of the growth to trillions of dollars in
individual retirement accounts and employee 401(k) accounts. As
investment companies have managed those accounts, private equity
investing has reached into every corner of economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, more capital has been made available to
minority-owned businesses with increased emphasis on the requirement
that they operate profitably and earn returns on that capital.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing Role for Church Organizations</TE>
<TE>   And that new financial order has elevated the importance of church
development organizations such as FAME Renaissance that act as
intermediaries between capital and the communities.</TE>
<TE>   FAME Renaissance runs a business incubator, teaching business
skills to potential local entrepreneurs, at its headquarters, a
once-derelict building that the organization has restored on West
Adams Boulevard. FAME Renaissance manages $5 million in venture
investments entrusted to it by Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Walt Disney Co. and
other companies, and has invested in three small firms, says the Rev.
Mark Whitlock, a onetime Wells Fargo banker who is now executive
director of FAME Renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   FAME Renaissance and similar church-related organizations also
operate as mortgage brokers and bankers, helping to secure 250 to 300
home loans a year.</TE>
<TE>   Progress may be slow, but a lot of changes are occurring, says
Linda Griego, the entrepreneurial restaurant owner who headed Rebuild
LA, or RLA, in the straitened mid-'90s after the initial post-riot
enthusiasm faded. RLA had little funding at that time, so Griego put
the organization to work identifying all the businesses that existed
in Los Angeles' many communities.</TE>
<TE>   The result was the creation of groups of entrepreneurial business
owners in food processing, apparel, plastics and biomedical
instruments manufacturing so they could lobby City Hall as
collectives and gain greater access to capital.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in a tour of the area that was torn by violence and despair
a decade ago, Griego sees home purchases by Latino immigrants
establishing family capital and new stores opening on side streets
between South-Central Los Angeles' long and still distressed
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   She cites Mercado La Paloma, an abandoned warehouse near 37th
Street and Grand Avenue that has been restored as a covered market
for small merchants by Esperanza Housing, a nonprofit organization
that renews apartment houses by serving as a bridge for tax
credit-assisted investments in affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   That combination of investment and entrepreneurial enterprise,
with an assist from government and nonprofit institutions, is truly
rebuilding L.A. today and will make it a more prosperous place in the
decade to come.</TE>

<LD>Drug users, panhandlers and other hangers-out used to cluster at dusk
outside Park's Liquor in South-Central Los Angeles, forcing Marai
Rodriguez to close her nearby building supplies store by 5 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "I was afraid to leave any later," Rodriguez said.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the liquor store is gone--one of an estimated 200 liquor
outlets burned during the 1992 riots. Rodriguez expanded her business
into its space, becoming part of a trend that has seen at least 40
former liquor outlets replaced by other businesses.</LD>
<TE>   The shift was driven partly by an economic downturn in the early
the 1990s and partly by the fears of some owners to rebuild. But it
was given a big push by community pressure and City Hall, which
imposed new requirements, ranging from reduced operating hours to
mandatory deployment of security guards, on many of the liquor stores
seeking to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   State figures show there now are 526 alcohol retailers in a
40-square-mile area of South-Central L.A., down from more than 660
before the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Citywide, the number of liquor retailers dropped by 15%, compared
with a 20% drop in South-Central L.A., an area bounded roughly by
Washington and El Segundo boulevards, Alameda Street and La Brea
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The new businesses include burger joints, shoe stores and used-car
lots, but views vary on the economic effects of the change. Although
one supermarket brought in more than 150 jobs, many of the new
businesses provide only a few jobs for area residents, and some of
the former owners see the conversions as more like "coercions" that
forced them out of business.</TE>
<TE>   But some shops, including Hogar's Building Materials &amp; Custom
Cabinets owned by Rodriguez on South Broadway, report increased
revenue. And to community activists and political and religious
leaders, fewer liquor stores have meant an improved quality of life
for individual neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, these neighborhood leaders say, watering down the
liquor trade leads to less crime and a chance to attract better
commercial developments to an economically depressed area.</TE>
<TE>   "What those 40-plus businesses are not generating is public
nuisance problems in the neighborhood," said Karen Bass, executive
director of the South-Central Los Angeles-based Community Coalition
for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, which headed efforts to
reduce the area's liquor outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't trying to solve the employment issue. We were trying
to reduce the nuisance problems that contribute to crime and deter
positive economic development," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Community activists describe many of the burned outlets as
"problem markets," stores that sold fortified wines, drug
paraphernalia, individual beers and cups with ice. Others had sofas
and lounge chairs in their parking lots, essentially creating outdoor
bars.</TE>
<TE>   "Problems like loitering, drug trafficking, public drunkenness,
public urination, violent fights, those kinds of activities are not
taking place in front of Smart &amp; Final," said Bass, referring to the
discount grocer that replaced a liquor store in the 3600 block of
South Vermont Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   But the burned-out store owners see themselves as victims, used as
scapegoats to take the blame for the deteriorated conditions in some
South-Central L.A. neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the stores that were burned out served a purpose in the
community," said Elliott Birnberg, president of the Southern
California Beverage Merchants Assn. "They were little markets for
people who didn't have the mobility to drive to the larger stores."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 50 stores selling spirits reopened in South-Central
L.A. after the unrest, with stringent operating conditions attached.</TE>
<TE>   The Community Coalition takes credit for keeping 150 stores out by
creating a climate in which scores of owners didn't even apply to
reopen. The group also rallied neighbors in affected areas to appear
at City Hall to oppose many of the reopenings and support such city
measures as a plan by City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas to waive
sewer hookup fees for new coin-operated laundries, Bass said.</TE>
<TE>   At least seven of the sites reopened as laundries--a needed
service but one that generates few jobs and is generally not as
lucrative for the owner as a liquor store.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most successful new or expanded businesses is Hogar's.</TE>
<TE>   A year after the embers cooled, Rodriguez used $140,000 in savings
to take over the site of the burned-out liquor store and an adjacent
check-cashing business.</TE>
<TE>   The growth spurt doubled the store's size, allowing her to add
products, hire two more workers and boost her revenue by "at least
100%," she said. "Now I'm able to close at 7 during the summer."</TE>
<TE>   At an erstwhile liquor store turned laundermat in the 5600 block
of South Normandie Avenue, business is so-so, "enough to keep the
place running," said the local handyman and unofficial manager who is
known to locals as T.C.</TE>
<TE>   Where C&amp;M Liquor once stood, children now play arcade games. A few
feet away, their parents use the washers and dryers.</TE>
<TE>   As with Hogar's, the demise of the liquor store was used to expand
an existing business, a smallish coin-operated laundry .</TE>
<TE>   "There's not so much hanging out now," said T.C., who declined to
give his full name. "Every now and again, but it's unusual. It's
nothing like it was before."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police reports show only one reported crime in that
block this year, compared with 14 in the same period in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Isabella Ko, whose husband, David, took over operation of the
laundry after the unrest, said the money coming in from the business
is "not a lot, is not so good." But running a self-serve operation
gives her more time to care for her children, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For Jin Hyuk Chang, business now is about double what it was when
his Western Square Liquor at Slauson and Western avenues was torched.
But that's at least in part because he moved.</TE>
<TE>   Chang, president of the Korean American L.A. Riot Victims' Assn.,
wanted to reopen at his old location. But community opposition and
city-imposed operating conditions pushed him out of South-Central
L.A. He now operates Big Mac Liquors in Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that [original] store had potential," Chang said. "I
really thought I could build up the business."</TE>
<TE>   The city Planning Commission wanted Chang to cut five hours from
his workday and bring in a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Legally, they let me open the store, but economically no, I
cannot," Chang said. "That's why I have to go somewhere else. I don't
have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   But he says business in his new site is better than it was in
South-Central L.A. The store is one-third larger than the previous
one and takes in twice the daily gross.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen members of the association, formed by store owners
uprooted by the riots, have returned to South-Central L.A. and still
sell alcohol, Chang said. "They are surviving, hanging on."</TE>
<TE>   With a hint of resignation he added, "I'm better off here."</TE>
<TE>   And Johnny Chu, owner of Johnny's Clothing in the 8800 block of
South Western Avenue, hopes he will be better off now that a
full-service supermarket, Superior Super Warehouse, has opened across
the street, replacing a small store that activists said relied
heavily on liquor sales.</TE>
<TE>   Superior is one of only 12 full-service supermarkets to open in
South-Central L.A. and the surrounding low-income areas from 1992 to
2002, according to a draft study by the Occidental College Urban &amp;
Environmental Policy Institute. But 10 stores have closed, so the net
gain is two, said Amanda Shaffer, the study's author.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 160 full-time employees, Superior is one of the
largest employers to take over a burned-out liquor site. Beer, wine
and alcohol account for make up less than 3% of sales, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Chu and Superior shoppers say the grocer has been a shot in the
arm for the ailing area. Chu said the store has yet to send spillover
traffic into his store, but he remains hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, a lot of stores were not open," said Chu, whose original
clothing store at Vermont and Manchester Avenue burned down during
the riots. "Now this is open. More traffic. ... I think South-Central
is building now."</TE>

<HD>Hospitals Seek Cures for Nurses Shortage</HD>
<DH>Health care: Many are using bonuses and other incentives to
woo new workers, often to the dismay of veterans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ronan Umali is the kind of nurse the health-care industry wants to
help ease its chronic staffing shortage. He's young--27--in a rapidly
aging profession, and male in a female-dominated field that women are
leaving in droves. His eagerness to help with any task quickly won
over his fellow nurses on Five South, a medical-surgical unit at
Kaiser Permanente's Woodland Hills Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for Five South, Umali will be gone in a matter of
weeks. He will be working at a Maryland hospital and, after that, at
a hospital in Honolulu.</LD>
<LD>   Umali is a traveling nurse who works in three-month stints. He
gets his assignments through a San Francisco-based medical staffing
services company aptly called Across America.</LD>
<TE>   "I get a housing allowance. I get a free rental car, free air
fare. They pay for everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Umali exemplifies the rapid changes overtaking the nursing
profession as hospital companies seek creative ways to cope with the
high turnover and shortage of qualified nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The big chains are paying signing bonuses for these traveling free
agents of the industry, raiding one another's staffs and helping
nurses repay their student loans in exchange for a commitment of as
little as three months of work.</TE>
<TE>   They say they are attacking the staffing problem by providing
funding for training programs and nursing school faculty;
scholarships; better working conditions, equipment and pay; and more
convenient continuing education.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital operators also are using technology and redesigning
hospital wards to change the way nurses work. Kaiser, for example,
has designed Five South to make the patients' beds closer to the
nurses stations to minimize walking and reduce fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's second-largest hospital
operator, is giving nurses short-range mobile phones to help improve
communications and is conducting pilot studies of computerized
order-entry systems and electronic medical records. It also is
providing mentors to recent nursing school graduates during the
crucial first 90 days on the job, when nurses are deciding whether
they can handle the work.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all competing for the same pool of nurses. That's always
been true but more so now," said Alan Ewalt, executive vice president
for human resources for Santa Barbara-based Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Some Say Hospitals Created Shortage</TE>
<TE>   But many veteran nurses say the hospitals are going about it
wrong. Their anger can be seen in a lawsuit filed this month by the
United Nurses Assn. of California against Tenet, charging that the
company provides inadequate staffing of registered nurses and
violates California labor laws by failing to pay for work breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Many regular staff nurses--most of whom have not seen a bonus or a
student loan forgiveness package, much less free air fare or rental
cars--say the hospitals and managed-care companies created the
shortage and are wasting millions of dollars annually paying inflated
salaries to temporary nurses while members of the hard-working rank
and file struggle along.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of taxpayer health dollars are wasted on vacuous
retention schemes that really go nowhere," said Rose Ann DeMoro,
executive director of the California Nurses Assn., the most vocal and
aggressive of the industry's labor groups. "What they are doing now
is putting beautiful paint on a rusted-out car."</TE>
<TE>   In Umali's case, all those perks may not be enough to keep him in
nursing long term. He says he plans to open his own medical staffing
company in a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   More than 126,000 nurses are needed to fill vacancies nationwide,
according to the American Hospital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That problem will only grow worse over time, said Dr. Peter I.
Buerhaus, professor of nursing and senior associate dean for research
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Buerhaus said the shortfall in
registered nurses will reach 450,000 by 2020 as the 78 million baby
boomers age.</TE>
<TE>   Taking inflation into account, since 1993 wages for nurses have
declined every year except 1998 and 2001, he said, and that has
driven more veteran nurses out of the field. The managed-care
emphasis on shorter hospital stays means that nurses see more
patients each day. Patients who are admitted for longer periods tend
to be the sickest ones who need the most attention.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Younger Nurses in the Work Force</TE>
<TE>   Buerhaus said the current nursing shortage began in 1998 in
intensive-care units. Many of the youngest nurses had opted to work
there and in emergency rooms, and they experienced early burnout.</TE>
<TE>   "They were fresh. They were bold. They didn't know any better," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of registered nurses younger than 30 has dropped 41%
since 1983 to less than 10% of the work force, Buerhaus said. The
average age for nurses is 43.3, and that will increase to more than
50 in the next eight years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer people are going into the profession, and those who do seem
to be wary of a long career in the field. Nursing school faculties
also are aging and diminishing, leaving too few people to teach even
if interest in the profession were rejuvenated.</TE>
<TE>   Marie J. Cowan, dean of the UCLA School of Nursing, said the
nursing shortage is particularly acute in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already working below the margins," Cowan said. "There are
too few educational slots to teach an adequate number of nurses, and
the rest of the country is already having a hard time attracting
people to the profession."</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by Watson Wyatt Worldwide said salaries for "hot
skill" jobs in the health-care field are increasing at a dramatic
rate. But the pay increases are not reaching everyone.</TE>
<TE>   An American Hospital Assn. survey of U.S. hospitals found that
about four in 10 are paying signing bonuses. Three-quarters of those
bonuses to registered nurses are in the $1,000-to-$5,000 range, and
some go as high as $15,000. In one case, a nurse received $10,000 for
a six-month commitment, the survey found. Bonuses also are being paid
to persuade nurses to take the least-favored work shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Competition Is Driving Salaries Higher</TE>
<TE>   More than half the hospitals are using temporary agency or
traveling nurses, with some filling as much as 6% of their staffs
with nurses who travel from post to post. Three-quarters of the
hospitals that hire traveling nurses pay them 20% more than they pay
regular staff nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals are competing with other facilities that require
skilled nursing care. In one instance cited in the survey, a hospital
was forced to raise salaries 15% to compete with facilities that
provide long-term care.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of wage pressure is unavoidable, Tenet's Ewalt said. He
said his company could hire 1,000 nurses today and still be short of
its needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We know every year it will be more expensive, but it's very
difficult to come up with a cost estimate," he said. "Our focus is
heavily on retention, and we're doing a lot of things to measure
employee satisfaction."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, which runs 116 hospitals in 17 states, including 33 in
Southern California, says that this year it is holding its hospital
administrators accountable for reducing turnover rates by tying their
performances to bonus packages.</TE>
<TE>   But Tenet, like other hospital chains, is facing disgruntled
nurses and charges of unfair labor practices at some of its
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Stoddard, 48, a nurse at Tenet's Sierra Vista Hospital in
San Luis Obispo, said: "Wages are not at all close to local cost of
living. It's very expensive to live here, and people are leaving the
area because they can no longer afford it. Nurses come here to apply
for jobs, look at the wages, look at the cost of housing--and they
leave. Tenet could afford to pay more."</TE>
<TE>   Nurses who work for other hospital chains also complain about
mandatory overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, you have to get over the notion that you can go home
when your shift ends," said DeMoro of the California Nurses Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Many also grouse about being shifted to wards for which they are
not trained. Some of the issues, including reducing the number of
patients for which a nurse is responsible, have been addressed in
California by the state's new minimum staffing law.</TE>
<TE>   But the hospitals know they must do more.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter Health, Northern California's largest care network, says it
has created RN Agenda, a program to improve satisfaction and quality
of work life; enhance compensation and benefits; expand opportunities
for career growth, continuing education and training; and tout the
nursing profession in elementary and secondary schools, according to
Ken Buback, Sutter's vice president for human resources.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital Ward Shows Challenges Ahead</TE>
<TE>   One place in which the struggle to retain and recruit full-time
nurses is on sharp display is Kaiser Permanente's Five South. Some of
its best-trained registered nurses have been promoted to other duties
and are rarely involved in direct bedside care.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nurses on Five South is someone who might be every
hospital's archetype: a 48-year-old bedside nurse who is not burned
out; who has no interest in promotions; who gets cards, phone calls
and chocolates from former patients; and who mentors nursing school
graduates in their first days on the job.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine Grandchamp is rarely at a loss for words, but she
doesn't have many when asked about what it will take to recruit more
people to the nursing profession and then get them to stay on the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," she said. She added that when she visits
elementary school students on career day, "they always ask me why I
didn't become a doctor instead."</TE>
<TE>   Five South looks more like a traditional intensive-care unit than
most hospital wards because it's designed with a central nurses
station and without long hallways. Patient rooms surround the
station, enabling nurses to monitor their patients without long
walks.</TE>
<TE>   An electronic voicemail system eliminates the need for paperwork
reports or face-to-face contact between nurses at shift changes. The
nurses use voicemail to listen to overnight nurses describe each
patient's night on the ward. Electronic prescription drug machines
eliminate trips to the pharmacy and the familiar sight of a nurse
walking with the ward's medications in small cups on a tray.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser has its work cut out for it, even in units such as Five
South, which were designed to make life as easy as possible for
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Yelina Kochergin, a 29-year-old native of Russia, gets tuition
reimbursement and full benefits from Kaiser Permanente even though
she works part time, putting in 40 hours every two weeks as a bedside
nurse. Kochergin, said Grandchamp, who served as her mentor, is the
kind of nurse the hospital needs full time.</TE>
<TE>   But that's just not in the cards, Kochergin said. "I need time to
recuperate. I don't think I would want to [work] full time because of
the stress level, dealing with patients' families."</TE>
<TE>   Other registered nurses assigned to the unit are no longer
involved in direct patient care.</TE>
<TE>   Verna Palanas, for example, has become the charge nurse; among her
other duties, she assesses the workloads of the nurses on her shift
and decides who has the least needy patients and can take on the
newly admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Another registered nurse, Stacy Silver, has become a case manager.
Silver spent much of a recent day trying to ensure that a newly
discharged patient would get home care.</TE>
<TE>   Grandchamp tirelessly worked through an "easy" day on the unit.
There were no medical emergencies, very few new "admits" and most of
the patients were progressing nicely. She displayed the energy that
helped her raise five children before deciding to become a bedside
nurse at 41.</TE>
<TE>   "I love bedside nursing. I try to lead by example," she said. "The
other nurses know I love my job."</TE>
<TE>   For many of those who have left the stresses of bedside nursing,
the jury is out on whether they might go back.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Burger, 51, a Kaiser Permanente nurse in Santa Rosa,
Calif., now works as a diabetes case manager, a job "that allows you
to have reasonable hours."</TE>
<TE>   Burger said she would consider a return to bedside nursing "once
the California staffing ratios are implemented."</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't know," she said. "I like having weekends off."</TE>

<HD>For Investors, Inertia May Be a Costly Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One law of physics doubles as a standard rule of personal finance:
Inertia is a strong force.</LD>
<LD>   The inclination, or outright desire, to leave one's investment
portfolio as it is usually trumps any urges to make change. In other
words, what you have, you're likely to keep, for better or worse.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it is all for the best. Warren Buffett, who knows a
thing or two about generating and keeping wealth, has said the best
time to sell a stock is "never." The idea is that it's smarter to bet
on companies growing and prospering in the long run than to trade in
and out of them, trying to catch short-term peaks and valleys in
stock prices while incurring trading costs and taxes.</LD>
<TE>   But last week brought more reminders that never selling also can
be hazardous to a portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, one of the greatest American technology brands of the
post-World War II era--Polaroid Corp.--proposed ending its bankruptcy
proceedings by selling its remaining assets to an investor group for
$265 million.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, if approved by the Bankruptcy Court, would mean that one
of the so-called Nifty Fifty blue-chip issues of the early 1970s
would be a total loss to shareholders. As recently as 1997, Polaroid
still was a $60 stock. On Friday it was trading for a nickel.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, major telecom-company shares initially rallied
from what had been multiyear lows, only to fall back into a tailspin
Thursday and Friday--leaving battered telecom investors to ask once
more, "Where's the bottom?"</TE>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies, which hit a record low of $3.80 on Monday,
shot up to $4.60 by Wednesday, a 21% gain from the low. By Friday the
stock was back to $4.29.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Group, which hit a 10-year low of $4.77 on April 11,
rallied to $6.51 by Wednesday, but by Friday was at $5.98 at the end
of regular trading on Nasdaq. Late in the day, the No. 2
long-distance company cut its forecasts for 2002 sales and revenue,
sending the stock price down to $5 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Since telecom and technology stocks peaked in 1999 and 2000, many
investors have held on because they believed, and perhaps still
believe, that the sectors are bound to come back eventually. All the
way down in these stocks--from Lucent's record high of $77 and
WorldCom's peak of $61--some investors who've stayed put have taken
comfort in the idea that they're in for the long haul, which has a
certain noble sound to it.</TE>
<TE>   The lower the stocks have gotten, some investors also have used
the argument that "there's no point in selling now, because I've
already lost so much. How much worse can it get?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that you can lose every dime in some stocks, as
Polaroid seems intent on demonstrating. Sometimes, what's down
doesn't come back, ever.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, someone who bought Lucent at, say, $50 a share in 2000
might not care all that much about the remaining $4.29 a share they
have to lose, should Lucent go the way of Polaroid.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a psychological cost in holding onto stocks that
already have lost the bulk of your capital. They can become huge
distractions within a portfolio. The time you spend worrying about
whether and when the stock will rebound can keep you from focusing on
other (better) investment ideas and decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Finance professor Hersh Shefrin, in his book "Beyond Greed and
Fear" (Harvard Business School Press, 2000), writes about the
psychology of investing and how people typically react to financial
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Most people, Shefrin writes, face "loss aversion"--that is, "they
have great difficulty coming to terms with losses." One result, he
writes, is that "people are predisposed to hold their losers too
long."</TE>
<TE>   Shefrin quotes from a brokers' manual written in 1982 by Leroy
Gross: "Many clients ... will not sell anything at a loss. They don't
want to give up the hope of making money on a particular investment,
or perhaps they want to get even before they get out. The
'get-evenitis' disease has probably wrought more destruction on
investment portfolios than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   If you paid $50 for Lucent, the stock would have to appreciate
more than tenfold from its current price to get you back to
break-even. Even if that is possible, a key question is how long
would it take. Five years? Ten years? Could your money, and time, be
better spent in that period?</TE>
<TE>   Even when stocks like Lucent don't go to zero, history shows that
collapses on the scale of those experienced in tech and telecom often
lead to long periods when the shares are simply dead money. The
companies may recover, but many investors remain suspicious, and
reluctant to bid aggressively for the stocks. Besides, more exciting
business concepts may be beckoning.</TE>
<TE>   What vexes individual investors perhaps more now than ever is the
feeling of not knowing who to believe about technology and telecom
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The opinions of Wall Street analysts have been discredited over
the last year as the inherent conflicts of interest within big
brokerages have been illuminated: Is an analyst being honest in a
stock recommendation, or is the tout aimed at securing investment
banking business from the subject company?</TE>
<TE>   Professional money managers who own the stocks have opinions, but
they, too, have an ax to grind in recommending them.</TE>
<TE>   As for executives of tech and telecom companies, in many cases
they have been as surprised, or more surprised, than Wall Street by
the plunge in demand for tech goods and services. Last week,
cell-phone giant Nokia Corp. cut its forecast for phone sales this
year. That pattern seemed all too familiar to Nokia investors: The
firm repeatedly had to cut its sales estimates in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   If the "experts" have few good clues when the tech and telecom
sectors will recover, and how substantial the recovery may be, small
investors may feel that they're completely in the dark about what to
do with the stocks.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, that also levels the playing field: Your guess
is as good as anyone else's.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with that reality, many investors with steep losses in tech
or telecom shares may continue to choose inertia as a response (or,
rather, choose not to overcome the inertia that is the norm in
portfolio management).</TE>
<TE>   But if the paper losses on your stocks consume the time you spend
focusing on your portfolio, try to imagine yourself unburdened by
those losses and able to concentrate on new opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   There is no guarantee that you will avoid selling your losers at
their precise low point. But neither is there any guarantee that by
holding on you will recoup much of what you've lost so far.</TE>
<TE>   Rethinking the response to natural portfolio inertia applies to
more than just investors who've suffered major paper losses. Despite
the prospects for an economic recovery, the backdrop for stock prices
is far different from what it was in the bull-market years of the
late-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Then, peace was breaking out all over, energy prices were down
sharply and the federal government was projecting budget surpluses
into perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   All of those trends now have reversed, in varying degrees. They
may not make or break individual stock prices, but the way they're
going they aren't confidence-builders for the market overall.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, investors who haven't changed much in their
portfolios over the last two years should be asking more "What if?"
questions about the economy and the markets, and how their portfolios
might fare depending on how those questions are answered.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have built a diversified collection of investments
(U.S. and foreign stocks, Treasury and corporate bonds, cash, and
hard assets such as real estate or gold), a portfolio review might
show that little or no action is required--i.e., inertia is fine.</TE>
<TE>   But investors who have thought about diversification only as an
interesting concept may well find that inertia now has become a very
dangerous force.</TE>

<HD>Earth Could Use Friends Like Abbey</HD>

<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>

<DL>MEXICAN HAT, Utah</DL>
<LD>This is Abbey country. And Ed is on my mind.</LD>
<LD>   Edward Abbey died 13 years ago this spring. It's no coincidence
that since his passing, the American conservation movement lost some
of its grit.</LD>
<LD>   During Abbey's lifetime, environmentalism was an ideal broadly
claimed, including by many who had no right to.</LD>
<TE>   Today, environmentalists are a special-interest group. The very
word "environmentalism" has, by the repetitious accusation of its
enemies and the aloofness of its friends, come to signify class and
culture conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, we permit the phrase "opposition by environmentalists"
to signify a regressive, not progressive, stance in our civic
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Abbey was the foremost conservationist
writer/philosopher of his age. He was a desert rat and a Westerner.</TE>
<TE>   As I hike through these mysterious rock lands he called home, I
ponder his lesson: Living in harmony with our surroundings is not an
elitist idea.</TE>
<TE>   "If America could be, once again, a nation of self-reliant
farmers, craftsmen, hunters, ranchers and artists, then the rich
would have little power to dominate others. Neither to serve nor
rule: That was the American dream," he wrote in his journal.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, environmentalists count among their bitterest foes
most of those groups Abbey listed.</TE>
<TE>   Abbey accomplished two things in his soaring personal encounters
with the Southwest and open spaces: His books such as "Desert
Solitaire" and "Down the River," along with his rompish novel "Monkey
Wrench Gang" raised our consciousness and challenged our consciences
about our diminishing frontier and the misguided tunnel vision of
those who plunder resources without regard to sustainability. And
more important, he made his case, not for the sake of the
environment, but on behalf of humankind.</TE>
<TE>   Nature, he frequently wrote, would correct its own imbalances over
time. The things he hated, like Glen Canyon Dam, would ultimately
perish. But would people survive to celebrate the day? Would they be
happy and free along the way?</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Abbey was a humanist. His wit and his gusto for
living were unbounded. He made conservation joyous.</TE>
<TE>   No one has filled his shoes, and too few have tried.</TE>
<TE>   As a consequence, the environmental movement has drifted away from
humanism. There are the die-hards who call Abbey their inspiration.
And for them, omitting those drawn to eco-terrorism, we can be
thankful. We need people willing to commit wholly. But other
environmentalists have become too much like a clique, too narrow, too
stern, too effete, too urban.</TE>
<TE>   How ironic: Two people who drive a VW and seek peace and quiet on
a hike are accused of being "elitists" by the pair who drive a 15-ton
RV with satellite dish, air-conditioning, whirlpool spa and a brace
of off-road vehicles in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Through their organizations, environmentalists have the attitude
of furrowed-brow bureaucrats. They "work the system," they do not
change it. Too many facts, not enough soul. Their loudest arguments
are not always the right arguments. They are celebrity-struck. And
they are glum.</TE>
<TE>   They see themselves as selfless but are often seen as selfish.</TE>
<TE>   I am one of them. I have made all those mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I'm thankful for Ed.</TE>
<TE>   He gave us words to live by: "Orthodoxy is a relaxation of the
mind accompanied by a stiffening of the heart."</TE>
<TE>   Edward Abbey was contradictory, xenophobic and polemical. May we
forgive him these flaws. That's because Abbey's exuberant defense of
freedom, the freedom to enjoy life, was more lasting than his
failings. Read Abbey and you'll realize why we use the word "nature"
when we speak of our "human nature." He reminded us that saying "no"
was not enough.</TE>
<TE>   He was a populist, that kind of elitist we can trust. In this
crowded world, he inspired us to say "yes." There is a reason, yes,
for preserving what is left of wild Utah and Alaska and California
too.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, a reason for clean water and fish in the rivers and ancient
forests, for healthy rangelands and for beaches where the water won't
make you sick. There is a reason, yes, for living in balance with
nature.</TE>
<TE>   The reason isn't the environment. It's us.</TE>
<TE>   Snobs? They're the ones who don't care about us, only themselves.</TE>

<HD>Standing Up to a Coup--and to Tio Sam</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can say one good thing for the right-wing political hacks that
President Bush left to oversee U.S. policy toward Latin America while
he and other top administration officials focused on the Middle East.
When last weekend's coup d'etat in Venezuela happened, they didn't
mess things up as badly as they might have.</LD>
<LD>   That's a backhanded compliment, but it does run counter to the
conventional wisdom about Washington's reaction to the brief,
tragicomic circus in Caracas that left at least 15 people dead.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has been widely condemned for not coming
out as quickly or firmly as it should have in favor of democracy when
the controversial--but legitimately elected--President Hugo Chavez
was briefly deposed by a faction of the military.</LD>
<TE>   A populist who boasts of his admiration for Fidel Castro, Chavez
was replaced as president for less than 48 hours by Pedro Carmona, a
civilian business leader. Carmona was ousted, in turn, after he tried
to dissolve the Congress and fire the Supreme Court. Since being
restored to power, a presumably chastened Chavez has pledged to seek
reconciliation with his opponents rather than revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The rap against Bush's Latin American policy team starts with the
fact that they were in contact with Carmona and other coup plotters
beforehand, although there is no evidence they encouraged them. Then,
once the coup was underway and other Latin American nations
immediately condemned it, Washington was hesitant. The diplomatic
damage caused by that delay was compounded when some administration
officials suggested that Chavez brought the coup on himself.</TE>
<TE>   So what that the criticism is valid. It also gives political
appointees such as Otto J. Reich, deputy secretary of State for Latin
America, and Roger Pardo-Maurer IV, the Pentagon's top bureaucrat for
Latin America, credit for more clout than they really have.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the coup, political activists who follow Latin
American affairs were spinning conspiracy theories on Web sites. They
all stressed Reich and Pardo-Maurer's ties to Nicaragua's Contras
when the Contras were backed by the Reagan administration. Add the
fact that Reich is a former lobbyist for Mobil Oil, which does
business in Venezuela, and is also an anti-Castro Cuban who
apparently never met another anti-Castrista he didn't like and you
have the makings of a juicy conspiracy theory.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the reality is far more prosaic--though still
worrisome. The lame U.S. reaction to the coup reveals that--with the
exception of Mexico--Latin America policy has been left to ideologues
or incompetents who haven't a clue when faced with a crisis in which
the facts are in shades of gray.</TE>
<TE>   A top Latin American diplomat who was involved in monitoring the
Venezuelan coup told me the problems his government had with
Washington ended when "we got the grown-ups"--National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of State Colin Powell--"to pay
attention."</TE>
<TE>   "They were distracted with the Middle East. But when they finally
came around, they did all the right things," the diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   He also describes a scenario that took place during the coup that
should be encouraging, even to those who assume nothing important
happens south of the border without a wink or a nod from the colossus
of the north.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat was in Costa Rica at a meeting of the 19-member Rio
Group of Latin American nations when news of the Venezuelan coup
arrived. Within hours, the attendees had approved a resolution
threatening to sever diplomatic ties with Venezuela unless the
country's democratically elected president was restored to power.</TE>
<TE>   "I know none of us care much for Chavez," Mexican Foreign Minister
Jorge Castaneda told the group, according to my source. "But a coup
d'etat is a coup d'etat, and we must all condemn it." The notoriously
arrogant Mexican diplomat proceeded to cajole and lecture the meeting
until the anti-coup resolution was complete.</TE>
<TE>   So if the bad news about Venezuela's abortive coup is that the
U.S. government hemmed and hawed while democracy was on the line, the
good news is that the Latin Americans themselves now have leadership
with the gumption to face down military coups, whether or not Tio Sam
is there to back them up.</TE>

<LD>After years of fruitless negotiations, God has been forced to take
legal action against his most cherished creation: the human race.
Apparently angered by countless negligent invocations of his name,
the formerly all-caring Supreme Deity threw in the towel and chose
the option of last resort. A statement of claim was filed in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York, between God,
a.k.a. Allah, Jehovah, Brahma, the Supreme Being (hereinafter
"Plaintiff") vs. The Human Race.</LD>
<LD>   Nature of Action:</LD>
<LD>   Plaintiff brings this action against the inhabitants of the planet
Earth for slander, negligent misrepresentation and breach of
contract:</LD>
<TE>   Whereas the leaders of those Defendants known as Roman Catholics
have fraudulently invoked the Plaintiff's name in the defense of
certain priests guilty of sexual misconduct with children.</TE>
<TE>   And whereas certain adherents of the religion known as Islam have
justified suicidal airplane and bombing attacks as being sanctioned
by the Plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   And whereas certain followers of the Jewish faith have justified
illegal settlements and military incursions in occupied territory by
appealing to his name.</TE>
<TE>   And whereas some devotees of Hinduism have justified arson and
murder on behalf of the Plaintiff.</TE>
<TE>   And whereas countless national leaders have claimed support from
the Plaintiff for various wars, campaigns and aggressions.</TE>
<TE>   And whereas most of the Defendants have breached their tenancy
contract with the Plaintiff to care for their earthly premises and to
abide by certain terms (see Schedule A--Golden Rule, Ten
Commandments, et al.).</TE>
<TE>   Now therefore:</TE>
<TE>   The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants are guilty of slander,
libel and negligent misrepresentation. Furthermore, the Defendants
are guilty of breach of contract and landlord and tenant violations.</TE>
<TE>   Wherefore the Plaintiff seeks specific damages in the amount of
$2,324,000,000,000 for required repairs to the planet Earth as
detailed in Schedule B.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore the Plaintiff seeks general damages in the amount of
$3,435,000,000,000 for loss of reputation and punitive damages in the
amount of $6,000,000,000,000 to dissuade Defendants from future
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Wherefore, the Plaintiff prays for (1) relief in the amount of
$11,759,000,000,000, (2) an order in the nature of prohibition that
the Defendants be prevented from invoking the Plaintiff's name or, in
the alternative, (3) a declaration from this Honorable Court changing
the Plaintiff's name to Larry.</TE>
<TE>   If you fail to oppose this action, judgment may be given in your
absence and without further notice to you.</TE>
<TE>   Issued By: U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New
York</TE>

<HD>'We People of Faith Stand Firmly With Israel'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH REED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This past week Israel marked the 54th anniversary of its birth with
ceremonies filled more with solemnity than celebration. And yet for
Israelis there is always hope in the very fact of survival. For many,
there is no greater proof of God's sovereignty in the world today
than the survival of the Jews and the existence of Israel.</LD>
<LD>   This truth explains in part why Christians and other conservative
people of faith stand so firmly in their support of Israel. But, as
it turns out, that is only part of the story, and the fuller
explanation is more complex and interesting.</LD>
<LD>   The evangelical movement swept the U.S. during the 19th century,
building robust denominations and projecting evangelical social
values, while simultaneously spawning social reform movements for
temperance, anti-slavery, settlement houses and orphanages.
Throughout this period, reconstituting a modern Jewish state remained
a remote concern at best, and sojourns to the Holy Land by American
Christians were rare.</LD>
<TE>   Following World War II and the shocking revelations of the
Holocaust, all this changed. Christians joined the humanitarian
impulse to support the creation of Israel out of the British mandate
in the Middle East. Few could deny that such a state was a moral
imperative in a world whose lexicon now included names like Auschwitz
and Dachau. Stigmatized by historical anti-Semitism in Europe,
renounced as "killers of Christ" by the medieval church, haunted by
the hoofbeats and horrors of the Russian pogroms, hunted down by
Hitler's Gestapo and shipped to death camps, the Jews who sought
refuge in the modern state of Israel needed no theoretical argument
for a homeland of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Christians, meanwhile, saw support for Israel through the prism of
a proud tradition that included Corrie ten Boom and Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, who sacrificed their own lives while resisting Nazi
tyranny and protecting Jews from the Holocaust. The depth of such
feeling in the Christian community is difficult to overestimate.</TE>
<TE>   I recall as a child my mother participating in a Methodist Bible
study in which she read the works of Bonhoeffer and other Christians
who resisted Hitler, passing on a formative lesson that standing up
for my faith meant defending the right of Jews to practice theirs.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, this humanitarian impulse became inextricably
linked with geopolitical reality. As some Arab states allied
themselves with the Soviet Union, the Middle East stood at a crucial
crossroads in the larger global struggle between communism and
democratic capitalism. Outnumbered and outflanked by the armies of
Arab neighbors--many armed with Soviet weaponry--Israel bravely stood
alone in a region that had known military conflict for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   This is still true today. Israel is the only genuine democracy in
the region and remains one of the most reliable allies of the United
States. The shared democratic values and common strategic interests
of Israel and the U.S. have engendered a deep bond that transcends
the domestic politics of either nation and survives the triumph and
tragedy of diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's Middle East policy embodies this bond. He has
condemned the inhumanity of terrorism, called Yasser Arafat to task
for his failure to contain terrorism and decried the use of violence
by both sides. It is unlikely that Bush's policy will alienate
religious conservatives, as they are sophisticated enough to
recognize that the president's own moral impulse is balanced by the
demands of statecraft.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, support for Israel derives from the simple fact that its
land was cradle of both Judaism and Christianity. Prior to 1967 when
Israel gained control of East Jerusalem, access to Jewish and
Christian holy sites in the old city was difficult. Regardless of
one's eschatology--and there are as many theological strains as
denominations--there is an undeniable and powerful spiritual
connection between Israel and the Christian faith. It is where Jesus
was born and where he conducted his ministry.</TE>
<TE>   I still recall my first visit to Israel, when I awoke at dawn in
my hotel and walked out on the balcony to watch the sun rise over the
ruins of the ancient temple of Jerusalem. At that moment, I saw
Israel's struggle for what it should be for all the world's
citizens--a struggle to maintain free and open access to the holy
sites of the world's faiths, a struggle to build a beacon of
democracy and hope in a region that has for too long known bloodshed
and hatred.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment, that hope is greatly challenged. But as Golda Meir
once remarked, "Pessimism is a luxury that a Jew can never allow
himself. May I say more broadly, today pessimism is a luxury none of
us can afford."</TE>
<TE>   Meir rejected pessimism, and so must we. Her optimism--the
touchstone of her faith--can bind Christians and Jews together when
the world's events seem to counsel futility, not only in opposing
terrorism, but in building a better world for future generations.</TE>

<KH>WELFARE</KH>
<HD>New York Program Wrong Model for U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGY WALLER</AU>
<BD>Margy Waller is a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution Urban Center and former senior advisor for welfare and
working families to President Clinton.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress has begun debating the reauthorization of welfare, and
President Bush has made his preference clear: He wants a New York
City workfare-type program to become the national model.</LD>
<LD>   Back in 1998, then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that every
adult or head of household still on the rolls in the year 2000 would
be working for a welfare check. He hired Jason Turner, then-Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson's welfare administrator, to accomplish this task
for New York City. In an attempt to achieve the mayor's goal, Turner
created the largest workfare program in the country .</LD>
<LD>   Under the Turner program, recipients first attended a 30-day
job-search program. If, by the program's end, they hadn't found jobs,
they were placed in workfare positions created by the city, doing
things like cleaning parks and subways. Most assignments did not
require or develop marketable skills. Many welfare recipients who
were in education programs were forced to quit school in order to
fulfill the work requirement. The program sparked lawsuits over
whether workfare participants were entitled to health and safety
protections, and there is fairly strong evidence that the program
displaced many paid city employees.</LD>
<TE>   On their face, the numbers out of the New York program looked
good. Since 1996, New York City's welfare caseloads have declined by
50%. Almost immediately, tightened regulations kept many applicants
off the rolls. By late 1998, only 25% of those seeking welfare were
found eligible, a marked decrease from the time of Mayor David N.
Dinkins, when 75% of applicants qualified. But the success of a
welfare program cannot be judged by caseload numbers alone, and the
Giuliani administration consistently refused to release the kind of
data that would make rigorous analysis and evaluation possible.
Little is known about long-term employment outcomes of participants,
nor about what has happened to people who were forced to leave the
rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when his deadline for all welfare recipients working neared
in late 1999, Giuliani proclaimed the program's success. This despite
the fact that when members of the city council and the press analyzed
what little data were available, they found that only about 15% of
the caseload was actually participating in workfare.</TE>
<TE>   What were the other recipients doing? Some were waiting for the
city to give them a work assignment, and nearly 30% were unavailable
for work because of bad health. Many others were working in the
private sector, but earning so little they were still eligible for
welfare assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Research elsewhere in the country also raises questions about the
effectiveness of workfare. In Washington state, where more than one
model was tried, a transitional program that paid actual wages to
participants had a positive impact on their later earnings. The New
York City-style work-for-welfare model, though, was ineffective. The
state ultimately discontinued the workfare program after evaluating
its results.</TE>
<TE>   But the lack of evidence to support New York City's strategy
hasn't kept it from being a focal point of federal policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Turner is a favorite on the congressional hearing circuit,
where he prescribes the New York City model as the right plan for the
rest of the country. Thompson is President Bush's Secretary of Health
and Human Services. Turner's top aid in New York, Andrew Bush,
directs the Health and Human Services office that administers welfare
block grants. And the president's plan for welfare reauthorization,
"Working Toward Independence," bears a strong resemblance to New York
City's workfare program.</TE>
<TE>   While welfare caseloads in most states began to rise last year as
the economy weakened, the overall caseload decline since federal
welfare reform in 1996 is dramatic, with millions of former
recipients now working. Over time, the vast majority of welfare
recipients do work, and most of them leave welfare altogether. Still,
welfare exists in part to ensure the health and safety of families
when the head of household is unable to work temporarily. Thus, it is
the nature of churning welfare caseloads that at any time a large
number of people are not working because they are waiting for
assignments, caring for sick children, lacking transportation or any
one of a long list of legitimate reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposal sets an impossible standard for states to meet.
It is estimated that only 30% of those now on welfare in New York
City--in the program that serves as a model for the
administration--would qualify under the narrow guidelines in the
administration's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The president's proposal isn't about helping welfare recipients
get and keep good jobs. As welfare rolls have declined, less than
half the money flowing to states for welfare is being spent on
welfare checks. As recipients have transitioned to work, more is
being spent on child care, transportation and training--supports that
can help people achieve long-term independence. If states have to
spend resources on creating make-work jobs for a New York-style
program, such supports will collapse.</TE>
<TE>   State and local officials have made it clear they prefer to
maintain--even increase--their flexibility in deciding whether
recipients are making progress toward work. In California, state
officials, responding to a survey by the National Governors Assn.,
said the president's proposal would "significantly limit state
flexibility to design programs that move families from welfare to
work." Moreover, additional work requirements--and the additional
child care they will necessitate--won't come cheap. Last week, the
nonpartisan California legislative analyst's office reported that the
state would have to spend an addition $2.8 billion over the next five
years to implement the proposed workfare program--tough news in the
face of a projected $15 billion state-budget shortfall. The state's
survey response added a plea to federal policymakers: "Resist the
urge to fix what isn't broken."</TE>
<TE>   By last count, one-third of the remaining national caseload was in
just 10 urban counties. Local officials in those places need and want
a menu of options to help families help themselves. They want the
flexibility to invest in training, child care and transportation, so
poor parents will be able to leave welfare and poverty for good.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials are among those opposing the new work
mandates in the president's proposal, estimating implementation would
cost $257 million. The county's chief administrative officer, David
E. Janssen, told supervisors that the victims of the proposal would
be children and families.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, Commissioner Verna Eggleston, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's new head of the Human Resources Administration, has a
similar perspective. In recent testimony, she said, "HRA needs
maximum flexibility from federal and state levels to allow us to
tailor our programs to meet the needs of our clients, where our
clients are.... It is clear that the 'one-size-fits-all' approach to
service delivery will not work."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some members of Congress are marching to the
president's tune--a lack of evidence to support his proposal
notwithstanding. The march is a fast one, too. House Republicans
moved last week to pass legislation that includes the Bush workfare
model, and they hope to have a vote before the end of May. The Senate
plans to begin hearings before Memorial Day. A bill must be passed
and signed by the president before the current law expires at the end
of September.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should listen to local program operators and state
officials--not the architects of the president's proposal, who seem
to be promoting what they think they implemented in New York City,
not what actually happened there. And not what the numbers show us is
needed there--or anywhere.</TE>

<LD>After the National Academy of Sciences published a study last week
concluding that Argentine ants are thriving in Europe and California
because of cooperation, we thought of an editorial holding up the
two-millimeter marvels as role models for all the tall ruffians
swaggering around these days in the Middle East and other epicenters
of human folly.</LD>
<LD>   Then we met the ants.</LD>
<LD>   While genially swapping workers and sharing information about food
sources with close kin, Argentine ants, it turns out, don't cotton to
strangers. Thrusting up on their rear legs, they spray non-kin with
toxic venom, then tear their heads and legs to shreds.</LD>
<TE>   Their phenomenal ferocity and strength (scaled to human size an
Argentine ant would be able to lift more than a quarter of a ton)
have enabled them to eliminate 90% of rival ant species in the
Mediterranean region. A smaller Argentine ant network--a series of
nests and tunnels stretching merely from Oregon to Mexico--has caused
ecological havoc in North America too, decimating the ant species
that some lizards, butterflies and other creatures depend upon for
survival.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that ants have much to teach humans. They have
come to outweigh all the big game in Africa and all the whales in the
world's oceans because they have achieved a level of social
cooperation far more sophisticated than anything dreamed up by
Confucius, Karl Marx or Adam Smith.</TE>
<TE>   But as much as we would have liked to cling to our original
editorial premise, we have to admit that peacemaking does not appear
to be the ants' forte.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After the shocking ease with which the Sept. 11 hijackers sailed
through airport security, President Bush and Congress moved swiftly
to upgrade air safety. In November they created the Transportation
Security Administration and set a Dec. 31, 2002, deadline for
screening all checked baggage. But the can-do mood turned sour in
Congress last week when transportation officials declared that the
deadline was "crushing" and said their budget estimate for this year
had soared from $2.4 billion a few months ago to $6.8 billion,
including funds to increase security employees to 72,000 from 32,000.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has certainly made safety improvements since it took
over air security in February. According to Deputy Transportation
Secretary Michael P. Jackson, the notoriously sloppy airport security
firm Argenbright will be almost completely replaced this week. But
inefficiencies and clunky management plague the agency. Kenneth M.
Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, acknowledged
to Congress that the agency wasn't able to explain how it had spent
the $2.4 billion that Congress already appropriated. It has hired
only two clerks to handle $250 million a month in bills and is unable
to verify the accuracy of its accounts.</LD>
<TE>   The biggest financial and security problem that the agency faces,
however, is deciding what kind of baggage-checking system to
construct. Ideally, it would install the most sophisticated machines,
which cost $1 million each and use a process called computed
tomography, much like CT scanners in hospitals, to check for
explosives. But not enough of these truck-size machines can be
manufactured in time to meet the Dec. 31 deadline, and installing
them involves extensive remodeling of airports, including
strengthening floors. The machine's readers need elaborate training
or the error rate soars. The inspector general's office has found
that CT machines already in place sometimes sit idle because
employees have ambiguous instructions.</TE>
<TE>   The other option is to use some CT machines together with
so-called Trace machines that cost $45,000 each. The Trace machine
can sniff out tiny particles of explosives but doesn't scan the
inside of a bag. It requires hand searches if an alert sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials believe that the most sophisticated
system would ultimately be less costly because it would required
fewer people to operate. But the agency has not devised a coherent
plan for where the equipment should go first or how long the project
would take. A combination of the two makes more sense in the short
term. And the safety agency should put more focus on a low-tech
project, matching every single checked bag with a person who boards a
plane.</TE>
<TE>   Starting up a new security agency in the aftermath of Sept. 11 was
a huge undertaking, and no one expected it to be without glitches.
Now, however, the agency must shift from a throw-money-at-the-problem
approach to a more sustained plan.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As springtime creeps its slowly warming way up and across northern
North America, much has changed at the three devastating crash sites
of 9/11--in New York City, at the Pentagon and in rural Pennsylvania.
The snows have melted. So have the shock, the despair, the shattered
assumptions, the incoherent fears. A nation still cleaning up is
savvier, more guarded, quicker to appreciate. Repairs have begun. The
resolve is emerging, like the brave faces of yellow daffodils that
shatter winter's gray. What hasn't changed are 9/11's nightmarish
visions: four silver airliners eerily soaring into three huge
buildings and a rolling field of grass where a little girl named
Marissa once played so safely.</LD>
<LD>   Today, pained pilgrims walk to one side of lower Manhattan to
obtain a small, free ticket for a 10-minute viewing. Then they trek
back across the island, up a worn wooden ramp covered with mementoes
and memorial graffiti to an impromptu open-air cathedral dedicated to
curiosity, closure, compassion--something different for each visiting
congregant.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly a million people have walked, shuffled, hobbled, wheeled,
prayed and cried their way to this public precipice. These days, even
at noon, chilly April shadows still cloak the modest, elevated
viewing stand that New Yorkers call simply The Site. As they move
toward the railing, eagerly curious, respectfully subdued even in New
York, suddenly It spreads out before them: a vast, square cement
coliseum, its depths inappropriately bathed in sunshine--16 acres of
cramped Manhattan weirdly wide open, over 700,000 square feet, more
than four large city blocks empty, void, gone, like the nearly 3,000
lives they contained. Big is too tiny a word.</TE>
<TE>   This scene of death and destruction is surprisingly noisy. Drills.
Air hammers. Horns. Sirens. Immense trucks beep-beeping backward.
Whistles. Diesels struggling into motion. Subway trains rumble the
ground once again. And then, incongruously, a squadron of vacuum
cleaners screams to life as workers spring-clean the tombstones and
grounds of adjacent St. Mark's Chapel, where President-elect
Washington also visited and prayed so many years ago. A few blades of
grass survive there, and the sparrows are back, chittering and
chasing each other through the still-barren branches.</TE>
<TE>   For long, silent minutes the visitors stare into and around the
gaping cavity, its depths and ragged margins. Then they look not at
each other--not yet--but up at the signs, flags and protective
drapings adorning surviving structures and the torn papers still
dangling from trees. Slowly, almost surreptitiously, they begin to
take pictures--to prove the hole is there and they were too. They
scan the graffiti: I miss you Angel. May your souls stand as tall as
the towers in Heaven. Joey Never Forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   There's no distinct smell at ground zero anymore. But there is a
distinct presence. Or a memory of one. "Ladies and Gentlemen," the
policewoman suddenly says in surprisingly loud tones for a wake,
"please begin to leave so the next group can enter." Slowly, some
still looking back, visitors move one after another toward the exit
ramp away from It, down through another long, tall canyon of
mementoes and prayers. They're quite quiet and quite composed, these
people from so many places--until they're asked, one after another,
why they came and what they're thinking.</TE>
<TE>   And then the tears flow. One after another.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Bumper Crop" [April 14] was interesting as far as it went, but the
real story was overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   Focusing on the minor environmental concerns of raising fish in
man-made fish farms and the need to use various antibiotics and
chemicals misses the point of why this effort has to be done in the
first place.</LD>
<LD>   It is yet another example of our society's tendency to take the
easy way out and work on effects, which in this case is a shortage of
fish, than the real story, which is the rapidly growing strain that
overpopulation is forcing on Earth's finite resources.</LD>
<TE>   The depletion of our natural fisheries through overfishing is only
one in a long litany of overpopulation problems such as overcrowded
schools, parks, roads, freeways, etc.</TE>
<TE>   As we move into the summer season and the since-time-immemorial
natural cycle of increased water usage, it would be enlightening to
read serious and salient articles on "Overpopulation Causes Water
Restrictions" instead of the same old "Water Shortage Causes
Restrictions" headlines and non-stories.</TE>
<TE>   The plain and simple truth is that Earth has no shortages; it has
only what it has. The population growth from 1 billion people to more
than 6 billion in only 150 years has started to take its toll on
Earth's limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   Mother Nature is trying to tell us something. Hopefully we will
listen.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your revelation about the conflict of interest in Merrill Lynch
analysts' recommendations does not surprise me ["E-Mails Open New
Probe of Analysts," Market Beat, April 14].</LD>
<LD>   In the 1960s, I was the treasurer of an investment club. As such,
I received the touts from our stockbroker along with the monthly
statements. Out of curiosity, I kept track of those recommendations
over a period of two years.</LD>
<LD>   My analysis showed that if we had done the opposite of what the
broker recommended, we'd have been well ahead.</LD>
<TE>   A deeper study indicated that if we'd received the recommendations
six months earlier and bought the stocks (there were never any
recommendations to sell), then we'd have done well if we'd sold them
when we really did receive those recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   This convinced me that the brokers had bought some stocks at one
time and then, some months later, touted them to their clients so
they could unload them at a profit.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, that broker was Merrill Lynch.</TE>

<HD>Best Education Plan Depends on Course Taken by College</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Question: My husband and I would like to help our grandchildren put
aside money for college. We are getting ready to retire and are not
rich by any means, but would like to be able to give birthday and
Christmas presents to each of them. What is the best type of
investment for us to purchase for them that will not take away from
any financial aid for which they might apply?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. Different
colleges have different approaches to financial aid, and schools are
just beginning to grapple with the ramifications of some of the newer
plans, such as 529 college savings plans.</LD>
<LD>   But chances are good that 529 plans will be treated more favorably
than other ways of saving, such as custodial accounts or Coverdell
Education Savings Accounts (formerly education IRAs), said Joseph
Hurley, a certified public accountant and 529 plan expert.</LD>
<TE>   Most colleges will treat 529 accounts as the asset of whoever
contributed the money. When the contributor is the parent, the
college will expect only a small portion of the account--typically
5.6%--to be contributed for education expenses each year, Hurley
said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, custodial accounts and Coverdell accounts typically
are considered to be the student's assets, and the student will be
expected to contribute 35% of those accounts each year.</TE>
<TE>   If the grandparents open and fund the 529 accounts, it's possible
the asset won't be counted because many colleges ask only about
parent and student assets, he said. On the other hand, some colleges
count every dollar of distributions from 529 and other plans,
regardless of who contributed the money, and reduce financial aid
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a complete discussion of this issue, check out the
latest edition of Hurley's book, "The Best Way to Save for College"
(2002, Bonacom Press). You also can learn more about 529 plans at
www.collegesavings.org, a Web site run by the treasurers of the
states that offer the plans.</TE>
<TE>   As you probably can tell, no one can predict what the financial
aid picture will look like when today's toddlers reach college age.
If recent trends are any indication, much of the available financial
aid will be loans--not grants or scholarships. So chances are that
each dollar you put aside for their educations will spare them a
dollar or more of debt, rather than cost them "free" money.</TE>
<TE>   Living, Bypass Trusts Can Offer Tax Savings</TE>
<TE>   Q: I understand the differences between a living trust, which is
designed to avoid probate, and a bypass or credit shelter trust,
which is designed to reduce potential estate taxes. My husband and I
have wills that establish bypass trusts upon our deaths. Our new
financial advisor associated with one of the big brokerage houses
said we should have a living trust as well. Our attorney recommends
we stick with the bypass trust but said he would be happy to make the
change if it would make us "feel better." Other than the probate
issue, how does one determine which type of trust to use?</TE>
<TE>   A: You didn't say where you live, but your attorney's attitude is
extremely distressing if you live in a state with high probate costs,
such as California or New York. There are a few reasons not to have a
living trust, but most people who have enough money to worry about
taxes, and who live in costly probate states, should have one.</TE>
<TE>   You can have both a living trust and a bypass trust. What the
living trust replaces is your will. All the provisions that are
currently part of your will would be incorporated in the living trust
document.</TE>
<TE>   First, a few definitions. A living trust is designed to avoid
probate, the court process that otherwise follows death. In states
such as California, probate costs typically eat up 3% to 4% of the
total value of the estate.</TE>
<TE>   Probate also is a public process, so anyone can check court
records to see how much money you had, who your creditors were and
how you distributed your estate. Living trusts allow you to avoid
those costs and keep the details of your estate plans from the public
eye.</TE>
<TE>   Living trusts do not, in themselves, reduce estate taxes. But most
living trusts have provisions in them to create other trusts after
death, such as bypass trusts, that are designed to cut down on future
estate taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Bypass trusts work by setting aside an amount of money--typically
equal to the prevailing estate tax exemption limit--when the first
spouse dies. (This year the limit is $1 million, so if one of you
died this year, $1 million of your assets typically would be placed
in the trust.)</TE>
<TE>   This money is allowed to grow during the surviving spouse's life,
and transfers free of future estate taxes to the heirs, typically the
children, when the surviving spouse dies.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not sure whether you should have a living trust, your
best bet may be to hire an attorney who specializes in estate
planning. This is a difficult and complex field that probably
shouldn't be left to the good old family retainer. Your local bar
association can offer you referrals to certified estate-planning
specialists.</TE>

<HD>Your Tax Return Is Filed; Time to Look at Next Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be the last thing you want to think about after dispensing
with your annual tax chores, but it's time to do a little tax
planning for next year's filing season.</LD>
<LD>   "Whenever people finish filing their returns, they put them aside
and don't think about taxes for another year," said Bob Scharin,
editor of Warren, Gorham &amp; Lamont's Practical Tax Strategies. "But
right after you've done your return is the best time to try to reduce
your tax for next year."</LD>
<LD>   A completed tax return practically bristles with planning ideas,
Scharin said. Simple things, such as looking at your marginal tax
bracket, will tell you whether it's wise to consider tax-favored
investments--municipal bonds, for instance.</LD>
<TE>   Doing a thorough review now can save thousands of dollars in tax
later.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly because the Tax Code is riddled with income
thresholds that bar higher-income filers from taking full advantage
of credits. Careful planning can allow many taxpayers to manage the
income level that matters--adjusted gross income--to get more of
these income-contingent breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other individuals may find that either their tax
bracket or their investment strategies warrant changes that could
prove rewarding--at least for tax purposes.</TE>
<TE>   You can start the review yourself, even if you use a professional
to prepare your return. Here's how.</TE>
<TE>   Start With the Kids</TE>
<TE>   For the estimated 50 million taxpayers with children, a place to
start is with the child tax credit, one of 20 income-contingent tax
breaks for individual filers. Are you losing part of this break
because of how much you earn? Here's how to find out:</TE>
<TE>   Multiply by $600 the number of dependent children younger than 17
that you listed on the 1040 tax form you filed this year. Compare
that number with the figure on line 48 of the form--the child tax
credit.</TE>
<TE>   If the child tax credit you claimed is less than the result you
calculated, your credit amount was reduced because your income
exceeded a certain threshold. Specifically, you lose $50 for each
$1,000 that your adjusted gross income exceeds $55,000 when single,
or $110,000 when married, filing jointly.</TE>
<TE>   Your goal is to find "before-the-line" deductions--these are
expenses that are deducted before adjusted gross income is
calculated--that you can take advantage of to lower adjusted growth
income (that's the figure on line 33 of your 1040 form).</TE>
<TE>   Contributions to 401(k), 403(b) and 457 retirement plans, alimony
payments, deductible student loan interest and certain work expenses
are likely candidates for before-the-line deductions. Make sure
you've deducted all you're entitled to in each of these areas. If you
aren't contributing the maximum amount to a retirement plan, for
example, you'd be wise to boost your savings level.</TE>
<TE>   Education Costs</TE>
<TE>   If you're paying expenses for a member of your household to attend
college in the next few years, and your adjusted gross income is a
little more than $41,000 if single or $82,000 if married, revisit the
before-the-line deductions. Those income thresholds determine whether
you can claim either the Hope tax credit, which can reduce your
income tax by as much as $1,500 annually, or the Lifetime Learning
credit, which can reduce your tax by as much as $1,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Each $1,000 in income above the threshold--$2,000 for married
couples--causes the taxpayer to lose 10% of the applicable education
tax credit.</TE>
<TE>   The AMT</TE>
<TE>   Is there a figure listed on line 41 of your 1040 form? If so,
you've been caught by the alternative minimum tax.</TE>
<TE>   The AMT kicks in for taxpayers who have unusually high deductions
for state taxes, medical expenses or large profits on investments. If
you regularly trigger the AMT, your best bet is to seek professional
tax advice about better managing certain types of income and
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Tax Bracket</TE>
<TE>   One last item to check on your 1040: line 39, which lists your
taxable income. Taxable income determines your tax bracket, which is
the tax rate that applies to your last dollar of income. (This also
is known as your marginal tax rate.) There are six federal income tax
brackets this year, ranging 10% to 38.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The higher your tax bracket, the more likely you are to benefit
from tax-deferred or tax-efficient investments.</TE>
<TE>   Investment Gains, Losses</TE>
<TE>   Now that you know your tax bracket, turn to Schedule D of your tax
return, where you listed profits and losses on your investments.</TE>
<TE>   If you did little trading last year but still generated
substantial capital gains, it's possible that you're invested in
mutual funds that pay little attention to taxes. It may make
sense--both to save taxes and boost your total return--to look for
funds that generate fewer taxable gains.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, funds now are reporting after-tax returns in their
prospectuses, so searching for a tax-efficient fund is easier than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   If the gains in your portfolio came from active trading--an
activity you like and intend to continue--you may want to look at
variable annuities.</TE>
<TE>   Annuities allow people who already have invested the maximum
amount possible in tax-deferred retirement plans (such as a 401(k) or
individual retirement account) to save additional money on a
tax-deferred basis.</TE>
<TE>   The costs associated with the annuity structure--it is a form of
insurance policy--makes them inadvisable for most investors. But
investors in high tax brackets who trade frequently may save taxes by
putting those investments in an annuity.</TE>
<TE>   Did you have more capital losses than you could legally claim as
deductions on this year's tax return? If so, those capital loss
"carry-forwards" can be used to shelter profits on the sale of other
securities--maybe those tax-inefficient funds you were going to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, people who invest in income-oriented securities, such
as bonds and real estate investment trusts, may want to consider
whether their tax bracket is high enough to suggest investing in
tax-free municipal bonds instead.</TE>
<TE>   How can you tell? Look at what is known as the taxable equivalent
yield, which is what you'd have to earn on a taxable investment to
beat the tax-free return on a municipal bond. For taxpayers in high
marginal brackets, the taxable equivalent yield on a municipal bond
is sometimes significantly greater than comparable taxable yields.</TE>
<TE>   To calculate your taxable equivalent yield, divide the municipal
bond's tax-free yield by the inverse of your combined state and
federal tax rate.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if you pay 38.6% in federal tax and 5% in state tax,
your combined rate would be 43.6%. The inverse of 43.6% would be
56.4% (1 minus 0.436), or 0.564.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, on a municipal bond with a tax-free yield of 5%, your
taxable equivalent yield would be 8.87%, or 5 divided by 0.564.
That's considerably better than the current taxable yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which is about 5.20%</TE>

<LD>Fed Decides Against Raising Interest Rates</LD>
<LD>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled that it probably
will be a few months before the central bank considers raising
short-term interest rates, despite the economy showing signs of a
recovery that ordinarily would prompt inflation-dampening rate
increases.</LD>
<LD>   Greenspan's willingness to permit rates to remain low, to continue
performing their growth-spurring work, stems from a virtual absence
of inflation and deep doubts about whether the economy's recent
revival is durable.</LD>
<TE>   Although the country has done considerably better in recent months
than most people had predicted, many economists wonder what will keep
it growing. Consumers, who confounded forecasters by continuing to
buy cars, clothes and houses during the recession, may be tapped out.
Many executives are still hung over from the business investment
binge of the late 1990s, and so are reluctant to expand hiring and
production.</TE>
<TE>   The result, according to Greenspan: "The strength of the economic
expansion that is underway remains to be clarified.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS to Hike Health Insurance Premiums</TE>
<TE>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System approved a 25%
increase in health insurance premiums for next year. CalPERS'
decision will be closely watched by health plans and health-care
purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   The premium increase would be the largest for the pension fund
since at least the late 1980s. It was a stark acknowledgment that
even a powerful buyer such as CalPERS--the nation's second-largest
purchaser of health insurance--was helpless in the face of spiraling
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, health insurance premiums went up by more than double
digits in the last two years, after relatively moderate increases or
flat rates in preceding years.</TE>
<TE>   Firing by Vivendi Exec Sparks French Protests</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Marie Messier, chairman of Vivendi Universal, fired one of
his key executives, touching off street protests in France, political
sparring and potential strikes against the nation's largest media
conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   Even Prime Minister Lionel Jospin became involved and suggested
that France's broadcast regulatory agency yank Canal Plus' right to
broadcast in France because of Messier's decision to sack Pierre
Lescure as head of Europe's largest pay TV broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin called into question Vivendi's commitment to French cinema,
alluding to growing criticism of Messier for betraying the nation's
culture by buying Los Angeles-based Universal Studios and moving his
family to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Some media watchers in France worry that Messier will turn the
company's pay-television service into a tool of American culture.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's ability to manage the company as well as its financial
performance are expected to be on shareholders' minds this week when
Vivendi convenes its annual meeting in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Fails to Settle Obstruction Charge</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firm Arthur Andersen failed to settle a criminal charge
of obstruction of justice last week after negotiations broke down
with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen now will go to trial May 6, facing one count of
obstruction of justice for destroying documents sought in the federal
investigation of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to settle a class-action lawsuit against the firm also
failed, and attorneys involved in the case said they expect little
movement on that front until late June or early July, when the U.S.
district judge hearing the case is scheduled to make a key ruling
concerning other defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andersen continued to disintegrate, losing several
dozen audit clients last week. The firm has lost at least 10% of its
audit practice.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to sell its tax practice, which generates more than $1
billion in revenue, to Deloitte &amp; Touche. Individual offices and
practices nationwide are negotiating their own mergers with rival
firms.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital Slashing Costs, 7,000 Jobs</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co.'s huge financing arm is eliminating 7,000
jobs and slashing costs by $1 billion this year, raising more
questions about the unit's stalled growth and the potential effect on
GE's overall performance.</TE>
<TE>   The job cuts, which equal 8% of the 90,000-person global work
force of Stamford, Conn.-based GE Capital Services, also come as GE
Capital is struggling to grow in the face of the weak U.S. economy,
which has affected most of GE's major businesses.</TE>
<TE>   This month, GE said its overall first-quarter revenue was flat
compared with a year earlier, which sparked a sell-off in GE.</TE>
<TE>   GE Capital generates more than 40% of the revenue and profit for
the conglomerate, providing financing for a broad range of
industries, from automobiles to aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   TRW Rejects Northrop Bid, but Will Share Data</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Corp. enhanced its unsolicited offer to acquire
TRW Inc. for $6.7 billion and TRW again rebuffed it. But for the
first time, TRW left open the possibility of negotiating a deal with
its defense rival.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that some analysts believe bolsters prospects for a
merger of the two companies, TRW directors agreed to share nonpublic
financial documents with "interested parties," including Northrop,
subject to confidentiality agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the directors essentially put TRW up for sale, but
because it appears that Northrop is the only bidder, the move mainly
would benefit the Century City-based defense contractor. TRW
directors had steadfastly refused to open the company's books to
Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a federal court judge granted TRW's request to delay a
special shareholders meeting that Northrop planned for Monday.
Northrop said it would challenge U.S. District Judge John Manos'
order that the meeting be delayed until May 3.</TE>
<TE>   HP Nearer to Buying Compaq After Vote</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co. inched closer to finalizing its controversial
$19-billion bid to acquire Compaq Computer Corp. after it announced
that 51.4% of voting shareholders cast their ballots in favor of the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary tally of proxy votes showed 837.9 million shares in
favor of the merger and 792.6 million against it.</TE>
<TE>   The tallies, compiled by proxy certification firm IVS Associates,
come less than a week before a Delaware judge is scheduled to hear
arguments in a lawsuit filed dissident HP director Walter Hewlett,
who is seeking to stop the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and legal experts said Hewlett faces an uphill fight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, HP disclosed that federal investigators opened
inquiries into reports that it may have improperly pressured Deutsche
Bank and Northern Trust Corp. to vote in favor of the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmetic Drug Botox Gains FDA Approval</TE>
<TE>   Botox, the popular drug that temporarily removes "frown lines" and
other facial wrinkles, was formally approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for cosmetic use.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will allow its manufacturer, Irvine-based Allergan
Inc., to start an advertising campaign to convince Americans they can
look younger and less worried with a few small injections.</TE>
<TE>   Not since the male sexual dysfunction drug Viagra was approved has
a drug attracted as much attention.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1.6 million Botox procedures were performed in the
United States last year.</TE>
<TE>   Botox, a sterile, purified form of the toxin that causes botulism,
has been on the market since 1989 as a drug to treat several muscle
disorders of the face. But in recent years, cosmetic surgeons have
been using the drug to remove frown lines and wrinkle by temporarily
paralyzing--and thereby relaxing--facial muscles.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Seeks to Revoke Lab License at Specialty</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is seeking to revoke the laboratory license
of Specialty Laboratories Inc., one of the nation's largest providers
of specialized medical testing, and has ceased payments under
Medicare and Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   Permanent revocation of the license, scheduled to take effect
Monday, could jeopardize the Santa Monica-based company's survival.
Specialty said it would appeal the revocation, which would not take
effect until the appeal is completed.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street analysts said they expect Specialty to survive
and come into compliance, but added that it is vital for the company
to keep its license.</TE>
<TE>   By week's end, the company's stock had finished at $9.50, up 19
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>I agree with your April 16 editorial on the health insurance crisis,
but I would take this one step further: The escalating cost of health
care affects not only the working poor but also those who are on the
brink of retirement but not yet old enough to receive Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   My husband and I have maintained an individual health-insurance
plan for several years so that we would be certain of health-care
coverage when my husband decided to retire a few years early. Just
two months ago our premiums were raised by over 60% and, what's
worse, our benefits were reduced. This was the second increase and
reduction in benefits within nine months.</LD>
<LD>   We may not have been categorized as the "working poor," but now we
are among the "insurance poor," paying out more than $8,000 a year
with huge deductibles and co-payments of up to 40%.</LD>

<TE>   It is time for the state government to take action before our
Titanic health-care nonsystem sinks. I have read the nine proposals
to expand coverage, been to one of the public symposiums and examined
the economic and qualitative analyses. You state that fixing the
problem will "cost money." Yet the most striking thing to me is that
the three major overhauls, all single-payer plans, not only fix our
health-care system properly but also save between $4 billion and $8
billion as compared with current spending.</TE>
<TE>   Those on the Internet can view the proposals, analyses and other
documents at http://www.health careoptions.ca.gov.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sponsoring health insurance through employers is a relic of wage
controls from half a century ago. People who are not employed still
need health care, and the system is difficult to buy into
individually, particularly if you or a family member has ever been
sick.</TE>
<TE>   What if we built a voucher program? Taxes would be raised slightly
to include the cost of a minimal health insurance policy. Everyone
would be entitled to a voucher good for a bare-bones health policy,
which he could take to the insurer of his choice. Insurers might be
asked to offer a choice of a high-deductible PPO-type plan or a very
basic HMO for this voucher. Then employers or individuals could
upgrade this plan if they chose.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance companies would get larger participation. Doctors,
hospitals and clinics would have fewer uncollected debts from the
uninsured, which are then paid by the rest of us. Children, the
self-employed, retirees, part-time and temporary workers and
small-business employees would all be covered by this system.</TE>
<TE>   It would cover people between jobs, people working for new
businesses and parents who want to stay home with the kids. Taxes
would go up slightly, but employers and individuals would realize an
equivalent savings in their health premiums.</TE>

<LD>Three cheers for John Balzar's April 17 commentary, "Charging to the
End of Paradise," protesting the Bush administration's plans to make
permanent the charging of "recreational" fees to visit any wilderness
area that is maintained by the U.S. Forest Service. Not enough people
are aware of this encroachment on the free use of public land, which
we have already paid to buy and maintain, and of the rapid
commercialization that goes along with fee-for-use.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, there are many more important issues to be concerned about,
issues dealing with our security, health, finances and the
proliferation of violence at home and abroad, but ready access to
wilderness sites for recreation and enjoyment of nature is of real
value to all of us.</LD>
<LD>   Those who care about the wilderness will be taking note of the
June 15 national protest date. Will the Bush administration be
listening?</LD>

<LD>"An Rx Against Violence" (editorial, April 14) accurately depicts the
landscape of treatment for mental illness in California. It is like a
train wreck with bodies scattered and left to die.</LD>
<LD>   As a person with mental illness I pray that AB 1421 passes. While
I am recovering and now working, not so many years ago I was homeless
and crying out in my own pain, "Don't touch me." Should I ever become
that ill again, I hope AB 1421 will be available to help me if I am
too sick to help myself.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Belief So Deep, Priest Scandals Can't Shake It," April 17: May
I diffidently suggest that all concerned agree on the following?</LD>
<LD>   * Betrayal of the Catholic Church's ethics, by no matter how many
of its priests, obviously doesn't shake the faith of devout lay
adherents or, of course, that of blameless clerics. Surely it can be
taken for granted that any faith, in any circumstance, survives in
the hearts of its followers no matter how many blasphemies are
committed against it, or by whom.</LD>
<LD>   * In the current situation, the major crime is, overwhelmingly,
the cover-up. Human weakness caused this crisis; to deal with it via
concealment and payoff is deliberate wrongdoing by the standards of
any faith, to say nothing of the requirements of civil and criminal
law.</LD>
<TE>   Norman Hudis</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years ago I left the priesthood in order to get
married. In all this time I have been proud of my service as a priest
and enjoyed sharing with friends and co-workers about what it was
like to be a priest in the difficult yet rewarding life of working in
parish ministry.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first time in my life I am embarrassed to tell people
that I was a priest. I am angry and feel betrayed by the cardinals
and bishops who have allowed the good name and work of priests to be
smeared by protecting bad ones. It is as if they believed that the
worst priest was more important than the best layman.</TE>
<TE>   And that, I think, is the heart of the problem. They believe that
the shepherds of the flock are more important than the sheep. Look at
Cardinal Bernard Law, who recently went to Rome to receive advice and
consultation about whether he should resign as cardinal of Boston
("Cardinal Is Backed by Vatican," April 17). The opinion of the
Vatican is more important to him than the opinion of the people in
his diocese.</TE>
<TE>   I will always love the church for the good it brings people, but I
can no longer respect these leaders.</TE>

<LD>Re "Create Work Policies Fit for a Mom," Commentary, April 16: As a
27-year-old married and child-free-by-choice woman, I fear that women
who are still under the delusion that they can have both a career and
raise a family will ruin all the progress the women's movement has
made in my lifetime. A woman who chooses to have children and remain
in the work force must understand that, ultimately, either her career
or her relationship with her children will suffer. Furthermore, a
woman should not expect her employer to support her choice to have a
child beyond the employer's legal obligations.</LD>
<LD>   In this day and age, motherhood is a choice, best made after
careful consideration of the permanent and dramatic impact motherhood
will have on a woman's life and future. Pressuring a woman to
procreate because her fertility is declining is deplorable. It is far
better to regret not having children than it is to regret having
children. After all, statistics show that the greatest danger to a
child under 5 is his or her parents.</LD>

<LD>The political crisis in Venezuela is not a local problem but an
international one, especially for the U.S. ("Venezuela's Strange
Days," editorial, April 17). Hugo Chavez has declared openly his
anti-U.S. ideas and his intention to turn Venezuela into a country
that will enjoy the brotherhood of nations with leaders like Fidel
Castro, Saddam Hussein and Moammar Kadafi. Since Chavez got into
power, Venezuela has started to exchange oil for technical and
intelligence support from Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. needs to act in order to find out the real intentions
that this new enemy of democracy has in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez was elected president of Venezuela democratically. But as
soon as he got into power things started to be different and, with
his dictatorial political style, Chavez intended to transform the
country from a free, democratic nation to a "Castro-like" island. He
is dividing the country, creating the potential for civil war. The
Bush administration has been busy taking care of the crisis in the
Middle East, perfect timing for Chavez and Castro to do as much as
they can to accomplish what they already have in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Leonardo Lugo</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. government officials discussing with conspirators the illegal
removal of the democratically elected president of Venezuela ("U.S.,
Venezuelans Discussed a Coup," April 17) brings back shameful
historical memories of an interventionist U.S. This political
behavior fails to understand that democratic institutions should
always be supported and protected--and not only when it is convenient
to some obscure tactical interest. There is nothing more important to
U.S. security than a democratic hemisphere. President Chavez is the
product of a democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should remember this and respect the will of the
Venezuelan people.</TE>
<TE>   Nestor Fantini</TE>

<TE>   I used to think a belief in democracy would be a prerequisite to
holding elective office in this country. Sen. Trent Lott's appalling
statement that he doesn't "have a problem" if the Bush administration
encouraged a coup against the democratically elected government of
Venezuela shows this not to be the case.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that a man who clearly doesn't subscribe to one of the
most basic, fundamental precepts of our republic can rise to the
position of Senate minority leader points to the moral bankruptcy of
the Republican Party itself. Lott and those who support him ought to
be ashamed of themselves.</TE>

<LD>Re county Supervisor Gloria Molina's illegal retaining wall and
swimming pool, April 17: As much as we may want to believe that
Molina and her husband will be required to pull permits for the
swimming pool or bring the retaining wall up to code, we all know
this will die on the vine. The $3,000-plus in fees and fines
associated with the wall went unpaid and so will this.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles operates under two systems--one for the common citizen
and another for the Gloria Molinas. If you don't believe this is so,
why wasn't the previous retaining wall fine collected? Even Patt
Morrison knows this is going nowhere and made light of it in her
April 17 column.</LD>

<TE>   It is a shame that there is such a double standard: Citizens who
are not members of the City Council or the Board of Supervisors would
have to tear down a wall that was built without a permit and that
does not meet the requirements of the Building and Safety Department,
and they would have to pay the fine and fees.</TE>
<TE>   Is the city taking steps to collect the $3,710 from Molina? Has
she pleaded poverty?</TE>

<HD>Eat, Drink and Be Married at the Ballpark</HD>
<DH>From coast to coast, couples are shirking tradition,
choosing instead to tie the knot in stadiums.</DH>

<LD>In the season for baseball and brides, some couples are opting for a
double play: At Dodger Stadium, the ring bearer presented the bands
in a baseball mitt. At Camden Yards in Baltimore, the best man threw
a ceremonial first pitch. At Comiskey Park in Chicago, bridal parties
posed for pictures at home plate. At Edison Field in Anaheim, at
least one couple married in the park's Hall of Fame, surrounded by
team memorabilia.</LD>
<LD>   Most stadiums have not actively advertised their parks to the
bride and groom, but the construction of newer fields with nicer
facilities and a trend toward nontraditional ceremonies have made the
ballparks attractive to some as wedding diamonds. Not all stadiums
are eager to play ball--Yankee Stadium is a reluctant sport--but many
are happy to make alternative use of their fields on days not
committed to Big League play.</LD>
<LD>   Couples who marry at a ballpark are often returning to the place
where they first met or had their first date. Some stadium employees
do it for the convenience. Others simply seek a unique venue to host
their own opening day. "People are looking for something different,"
says Genia Larson-Moore, director of sales and catering at Coors
Field in Denver. "The ballpark offers something that everyone loves
from every generation."</LD>
<TE>   As she well knows. One day after the 2000 baseball season at Coors
Field, her boyfriend asked her to accompany him to home plate. (Both
worked for the stadium at the time.) There, he threw her a fastball.
The scoreboard read: "Genia, my love, will you marry me?" When she
said yes, the couple decided that "it didn't make any sense to go
anywhere else" for the wedding, Larson-Moore, 25, recalls.</TE>
<TE>   At their August ceremony, the couple hosted cocktails for 250
guests in the outfield. The wedding and reception followed in a
picnic area just outside the playing field.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that my wedding is going to be the talk for a long time,"
Larson-Moore says. And some couples step up to the plate for that
very reason.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about doing what Emily Post says anymore," says Randie
Wilder-Pellegrini, executive producer and president of Cordially
Invited, Inc., in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Couples are planning less conventional and more personal
ceremonies, preparing the reception meal with family recipes and
creating table decorations with baby pictures, for instance. In
keeping with this trend, event planners have seen couples move away
from places where ceremonies have traditionally been held--churches
or hotels--and choose locations that have more meaning to them.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a yearning on the part of engaged couples to have
their wedding ceremony express themselves," says Lisa Hurley, editor
of Special Events magazine. "Every element of the event articulates
who those people are."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, when Susie and Brad Byers met for a blind date at Dodger
Stadium, they weren't sure they'd get to first base. Five and a half
years later, they went all the way. The couple, who describe
themselves as being "more jeans-and-T-shirt than shirt-and-tie,"
wanted a traditional church wedding but not the traditional ballroom
reception. At their November reception in the Dodgers Dugout Club,
the caterer served Dodger Dogs alongside roast turkey breast. Tiny
baseball bats and gloves dotted the icing on their three-tier wedding
cake. And "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" played as the Cypress couple
took to the dance floor for the first time as husband and wife. "It
was traditionally untraditional," says Susie Byers, 29.</TE>
<TE>   Since Levy Restaurants took over Dodger Stadium in 2000, the
ballpark has hosted about five weddings and 100 receptions at its two
restaurants, says Christine Wilson, sales manager at Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The upscale Stadium Club, with its white table linens and light
wood paneling, overlooks right field. Only season ticket-holders can
access the restaurant, which seats about 400, on game days. The
Dugout Club, located behind home plate, is decorated with Dodger
memorabilia, including the private photo collection of former team
president Peter O'Malley and the 1988 World Series trophy. Neon blue
lights and plush velvet chairs complete the decor.</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field, home of the Anaheim Angels, hosted about a dozen
weddings and receptions in its two restaurants and Hall of Fame last
year, according to Nick Julian, premium service manager at the field.
The Diamond Club features outdoor dining behind home plate, while the
club level Knothole Club offers a view of the field.</TE>
<TE>   Reception fees range depending upon stadium, party size and menu.
At Comiskey Park, for example, there is an $8,000 food and beverage
minimum. Wrigley Field has a $4,000 minimum. Renting home plate for a
wedding can cost anywhere from $1,000 (Coors Field) to $5,000 (Dodger
Stadium). Renting the entire field can start at $25,000. Some
stadiums will introduce the bridal party on the Jumbotron or bring in
the stadium organist to play the wedding march for additional fees.
At Edison Field, couples can set off fireworks for about $1,500 a
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Most stadiums only hold events when the home team is out of town
or during the off-season. This season alone, Larson-Moore, who books
weddings at Coors Field, has more than a dozen weddings and
receptions scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   With the events, stadiums can keep staff employed throughout the
year, says Bob Adolfson, vice president of national sales for
Aramark, which provides food and beverages for 13 baseball stadiums,
including Edison and Coors fields. The events are also an additional
source of revenue, which can be particularly important for some of
the newer fields.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium has not yet hosted any weddings, but 2-year-old
Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco markets the field for a variety of
other events, including birthdays, business conventions and bar
mitzvahs. (One of its most expensive packages: a night on the field
with dinner along with a movie screened on the Jumbotron at a cost of
$150,000.) "We're open to do it," says Stephen Revetria, director of
sales and marketing for the park, "because we have a mortgage to
pay."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, though, is such a fan.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Stadium, perhaps the most famous baseball stadium in the
world, will host weddings and other events; however, officials there
"frown on it," says Joel White, of concessions and hospitality. "It
sounds like a very cute thing, but when you get down to it, it's not
our business .... We're not a catering hall, we're a baseball park."</TE>
<TE>   For Sherri Hoffman and Bill Whipple, Dodger Stadium is even "holy
ground." The sanctity of the field made it the only place for the
Pasadena couple to sanctify their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   During their November 2000 nuptials, the wedding party donned
Dodger blue and yarmulkes with the team's logo. Baseball bats held
the Jewish chuppah, or bridal canopy, above home plate. Dinner, in
the stadium's Dugout Club, started with hors d'oeuvres of peanuts and
pigs in a blanket. And guests received Dodger baseball bats and
balls--imprinted with the couple's wedding date--as favors.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't a whole lot that we didn't include," Hoffman, 46,
says on a recent Saturday before she and Whipple, 51, head out to the
ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who never miss a home game, met at the stadium; their
season tickets were next to each other. Reserve level. Aisle 11. Row
V. They still sit in the same seats.</TE>
<TE>   "How many times do you go back to where you were married?" Hoffman
asks. "We go back 81 times a year. Please, with season playoffs, 90
times. It's where we belong. It's home."</TE>

<HD>The Old College Try</HD>
<DH>Good grades? Not enough. An upscale school goes to bat to
give its students an Ivy League edge.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Marlborough School brought 51 girls to Yale and got them an hour with
a dean. He enticed them with the university's world-class drama
program. He boasted about its expert professors. He even talked up
the sailing team.</LD>
<LD>   Then associate admissions dean Rob Jackson hit the California
girls with this: Yale receives 15,000 applications each year, and "we
only have so much space here."</LD>
<LD>   As the high school sophomores and juniors filed out into the rain,
undaunted, for a private tour, their chaperons ducked upstairs with
Jackson to try to secure some of Yale's "space" for Marlborough's
seniors.</LD>
<TE>   Yale was just days away from mailing its acceptance letters to
members of the current senior class. Steve Burnett, a college
counselor at Marlborough, and Jim Skrumbis, the high school's
principal, knew Jackson had three hours to shrink the "admit" pile by
22 applicants. They wanted to persuade him to keep Marlborough's
files in the stack. After all, there's not much value in a prep
school that prepares students for elite colleges but can't get them
in.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting last month in Jackson's office lasted 45 minutes.
Burnett and Skrumbis walked out knowing, mostly, which Marlborough
applicants Yale would admit. They were pleased. "We made a pretty
good case," Burnett said.</TE>
<TE>   Not every high school gets that access, and not every college
allows it. But for college preparatory schools like Marlborough, such
meetings are part of an admissions strategy that is sophisticated,
successful and far more personal than at just about any public
school.</TE>
<TE>   These private schools hire counselors away from college admissions
offices. They take packs of students across the country to visit
campuses. And they parlay any advantage, any connection, to get their
graduates admitted to the nation's most coveted universities.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of it is about the girl--who she is and what she
does," Skrumbis said. "We pride ourselves on working the margins."</TE>
<TE>   At Yale, striding through a Gothic building that looked more
suited for a church than the university's athletic department,
Skrumbis got a head start on promoting next year's seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "Should we go put in a pitch for Cameron?" he asked Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron Washington, a junior at Marlborough, ran 400 meters in
55.6 seconds at a meet in California last year. Skrumbis and Burnett
figure that talent, on top of good grades, will be Cameron's hook
when she applies next year to super-selective colleges. If the track
coaches want her, the admissions deans probably will too.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the real deal, so keep your eye on her," Skrumbis told one
of Yale's coaches, who seemed a little surprised to see the
prep-school pitchmen all the way from California. "She's an
outstanding student. We're an outstanding school."</TE>
<TE>   Some decry that sort of advocacy by private schools as unfair
lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Marlborough sophomore Danielle Koffler, an ice-skater who wants to
attend a college with a rink, sees it differently. "You could kind of
say we have an advantage," she said. "But that's also what we're
paying for."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Marlborough focuses so intensely on its students' higher
education because the school's reputation depends on it. Tuition and
fees for next year total $20,100, and getting students into college
goes a long way toward justifying that. Not community college. Not
even certain state universities. But a "name college," one that ranks
highly in guidebooks and looks smart on a sweatshirt or a sticker on
the family SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Like the universities where it sends its graduates, Marlborough is
selective. Surrounded by mansions in Los Angeles' Hancock Park, the
113-year-old school starts in seventh grade. Four hundred girls
applied this year for that grade's 85 spots.</TE>
<TE>   Marlborough's 530 students get small classes, highly qualified
teachers, a variety of extracurricular activities and courses that
range in the upper school from contemporary poetry to multivariable
calculus.</TE>
<TE>   The package also includes a college counseling staff dedicated to
placing the school's graduates. Two counselors work at this
full-time, year-round, and an assistant works with them to track the
paperwork and hold students to deadlines. A third counselor, the
school's admissions director, is committed part-time. All three
counselors have experience on the other side--evaluating applications
in college admissions offices.</TE>
<TE>   Marlborough gets students thinking seriously about college by 10th
grade, a full two years before they apply. In the fall, the girls
take a preliminary entrance exam--the PSAT. To identify the type of
college they want, many sophomores, plus a few juniors, pay $1,600
for the school's spring-break tour of Eastern campuses. (Students are
close enough to California campuses to visit them on their own, the
counselors figure.)</TE>
<TE>   This year's Eastern itinerary crammed 18 campuses into seven days.
For girls seeking city life, the group stopped in Philadelphia at the
University of Pennsylvania, in New York at Columbia and NYU, and at
several campuses in Boston. For those interested in a women's
college, there was Barnard. For a taste of smaller, quieter schools,
Pennsylvania's Lafayette College, where Burnett once worked in
admissions, and Connecticut College were included.</TE>
<TE>   A whirlwind college tour is a rite for thousands of high school
students. Usually, though, their parents, or maybe a tour company,
lead the march--not their counselors and principal. As Marlborough
traveled last month, at least three other Los Angeles prep schools
were on the road too: Brentwood, Harvard-Westlake in Studio City and
Campbell Hall in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Free from their parents, at least on this trip, Marlborough's
students didn't have to ask how much the tuition was. They didn't
need to test the locks on the dormitories. And they could openly
declare certain things to be really cool, like the flier in an NYU
dorm advertising "weekly discussions dedicated to the exploration of
sexual bondage, power relationships, sadomasochism, and pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say Marlborough's girls were easily impressed. They
are smart, articulate and confident, and they know what they want
from college--everything. "I'm Ingrid, and today I'm interested in
psychology, English, Spanish and music," one girl told an admissions
officer, joining a chorus of would-be singing lawyers and dancing
mathematicians.</TE>
<TE>   In the private tours and information sessions arranged by their
counselors, the girls asked question after (often esoteric) question,
recording the answers in their steno pads.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have a fencing team?"</TE>
<TE>   "Has your Tel Aviv study abroad program been put on hold?"</TE>
<TE>   "Are the rare books in the library only available to English
majors, or are they open to everybody?"</TE>
<TE>   The wet, chilly Northeastern weather was not the turnoff the
sun-loving Californians expected. After all, sophomore Molly Tobin
pointed out, "You get cute clothes when you're in a cold climate."</TE>
<TE>   At Yale, where Molly fell "completely and utterly in love," the
admissions office opened early to accommodate Marlborough's schedule.
The Ivy League university admitted four seniors from Marlborough
during its early-decision period and was passing judgment on 11 more.
A month before the school's college tour, Marlborough's director of
college counseling, Susan Lewandowski, flew east to personally lobby
for the school's girls at Yale and several other universities.</TE>
<TE>   Not all colleges welcome such visits, however. Princeton's
admissions officers, for example, ban high school counselors from
their offices and do not accept their phone calls. Any communication
must be written.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just always operated on the principle that if we aren't able
to provide particular opportunities for all of the schools from which
we receive applicants (over 5,000 schools in a given year), we
shouldn't provide them for any," admissions dean Fred Hargadon wrote
in an e-mail to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Yale's doors are more open.</TE>
<TE>   "We interact with all kinds of counselors, and we do it often,"
said Richard Shaw, the university's dean of undergraduate admissions.
"I don't think that's giving them any significant advantage when that
goes on. It just means we're communicating." (His staff does not
communicate, however, with the growing field of independent
counselors, who are not employed by schools and charge students for
advice.)</TE>
<TE>   Among public high schools, those in well-to-do suburban districts
tend to have college counseling offices most similar to the prep
schools'. But they are juggling the needs and files of hundreds more
students. They can only marvel at the time their private-school
colleagues can devote to their students--and the access colleges
afford them.</TE>
<TE>   "They pick up the phone and say, 'This is what I've got from my
spring crop. What do you think?'" said Cynthia Martini, one of two
college counselors for the 1,000 juniors and seniors at highly
competitive Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's fair or unfair. That's the way of life,"
Martini said. She would like to tell more admissions officers about
Sunny Hills, where students were accepted this year to Yale and
Stanford. Unlike private-school counselors, however, Martini can't
visit a campus unless the college pays her way or she happens to be
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Marlborough cannot be sure what difference its counselors'
advocacy makes, but the school can show off an impressive list of
colleges that have accepted its students. The week after
Marlborough's group visited New Haven, Yale admitted four more
girls--a total of eight, or nearly 10% of Marlborough's Class of
2002. This year, 45% of the seniors who applied to Ivy League schools
were admitted, and the UC system took 90% of Marlborough's
applicants. Other highly selective colleges, such as Northwestern,
Vassar and Wesleyan, admitted 76% of the Marlborough students who
applied, according to counselor Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, this was "our best year ever."</TE>
<TE>   Now Marlborough is concentrating on the juniors--track star
Cameron and her classmates. The girls are attending workshops to
learn how to write compelling, persuasive essays. Their counselors
will write letters of recommendation over the summer. And until the
spring of 2003, the school will continue "working the margins."</TE>
<TE>   At Brown University, two stops after Yale, Skrumbis persuaded
Cameron to introduce herself to the track coach leading the
question-and-answer session. As she shook the coach's hand, Skrumbis
volunteered Cameron's best time.</TE>
<TE>   "Sub-55, 400 meter. Great student," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Walking back to the bus, Skrumbis patted Cameron on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "There you go," he said. "You're making all kinds of connections.
Good for you."</TE>

<LD>"The Girl Who Cried Monster"</LD>
<LD>   by R.L. Stine</LD>
<LD>   Once there was a girl who loved to scare her little brother Randy
with monster stories. But one day she meets a real monster, and it's
hungry! Too bad she's told too many monster stories for anyone to
believe her. Too bad the monster knows who she is and is going to eat
her! To find out who the monster is and what happens next, buy the
book at any bookstore or borrow it from your public library. I would
recommend this book to anyone who likes scary and adventurous
stories.</LD>

<HD>Still Mourning for a Lost Neutra Landmark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First we would like to commend you for the excellent article by Kathy
Bryant ("When a Neutra Landmark Becomes a Tear-Down," April 11). When
Bryant reached us, we did not fully have a chance to put our point of
view across, and we would like to make the following comments:</LD>
<LD>   We had no prior relationship whatsoever with the buyer, Richard
Rotenberg of Hopkins, Minn. We feel totally deceived by Mr.
Rotenberg, who told us he was just going to do minor alterations to
the house and bring it up to earthquake standards. If we had known
the truth, we never would have sold him the house. He was well aware
of the fact that it was a Neutra house.</LD>
<LD>   It had been our sole desire to protect the house when we sold it.
That is why we hired Sotheby's realty and added one of the L.A.
experts in vintage houses to help with the sale, and why we put a
price of $850,000 above the appraised value of the house.</LD>
<TE>   We cannot overstate how devastated we are by this loss. This house
was in pristine condition. To our knowledge, it was the last
remaining Neutra house built and lived in by the original owners.
Nothing was changed or modified since it was built in 1962. Tours by
every museum in the country came through. Many came expressly to
Rancho Mirage to see the house.</TE>
<TE>   To think that a wanton act of violence to this house in one day
could destroy what the family for 40 years has tried to protect is
very sad.</TE>
<TE>   In the last six months, we have lost my mother and sister, and my
wife's father, all of whom spent many years of pleasure in this
house. In many ways, the loss of the house is the cruelest and most
senseless death of all.</TE>
<TE>   JIM and LAURA MASLON</TE>
<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   Jim Maslon is the son of Luella and Samuel Maslon, who
commissioned the Neutra home in Rancho Mirage, which was torn down in
March.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Luckily the Maslons' art collection didn't come with the house, or
we would be reading about some amateur painter that decided that a
Matisse or Lichtenstein would make a great canvas to paint over, or
that a Henry Moore sculpture could be ground up for gravel.</TE>
<TE>   What a tragedy and loss for architecture.</TE>
<TE>   DAVID ROSE</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While I was distressed to read of the destruction of the Maslon
House, I was equally distressed to see all of the blame placed on the
new owner, Richard J. Rotenberg. Some responsibility falls on the
shoulders of Samuel and Luella Maslon for not making any provisions
in their estate to protect the building they created and supposedly
loved.</TE>
<TE>   There are many things the Maslons could have down in their
lifetime to prevent the "architectural terrorism" that occurred in
Rancho Mirage. Having the building declared a historic landmark
usually keeps away people who would do it harm. They could have made
a provision in their wills that the house could be sold only to
someone who would live in it. A variety of alternatives existed for
the Maslons other than to do nothing and hope that nothing bad would
happen to the building. When you care about architecture, you need to
protect it, not hope others will read your mind after you are dead.</TE>
<TE>   RODNEY KEMERER</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what's worse--the mind-set that destroys the unique
and irreplaceable or the city government that permits it. If you
don't like or can't appreciate something, don't buy it.</TE>
<TE>   What a dark and depressing legacy for a city once so bright and
beautiful. The true mirage in this wealthy desert city is Neutra's
once sublime Maslon House, now a murky image in the minds of those
lucky enough to have seen it.</TE>

<HD>Maybe Some Men See Marriage as a Bad Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank goodness we have government-funded, ivory-tower intellectuals
such as James Q. Wilson ("Scholar Examines the Decline of Marriage,"
April 10) to explain that young black men eschewing marriage "results
from an unholy trinity of the legacy of the Enlightenment, slavery
and an African family structure...." An ignorant soul such as myself
might have thought that American families (largely nuclear until the
introduction of welfare laws in the 1950s) and our work ethic were
being torn apart by high income taxes (higher still for two-earner
married couples), a 13% Social Security tax and a society where
divorce papers are as close as the nearest office supply store. Not
to mention a quick waltz through court, followed by child support and
alimony laws guaranteeing freedom for the ex-wife and poverty income
levels for all.</LD>
<LD>   Silly me. I thought the reason many young men are loath to
approach the altar is that they know a bad deal when they see one.</LD>

<HD>A Curious Theory About Children's Development</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, little Junior is driving you crazy, running from window to window
in the mall, badgering strangers in the grocery store, peppering you
with questions in the car. Take heart. You may have a rocket
scientist on your hands.</LD>
<LD>   According to a new study of links between personality and mental
ability, children who are outgoing and adventurous as toddlers have
substantially higher IQs by the time they are preteens.</LD>
<LD>   Call them "stimulation seekers" rather than troublemakers and it
all makes sense. "Children who go out and explore, engage in
conversation, socialize with other kids, create a kind of enriched
environment for themselves," explains USC professor Adrian Raine,
co-author of the study, published last week in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.</LD>
<TE>   "Curiosity, far from killing the cat, can make for a much brighter
bunch of kittens."</TE>
<TE>   Raine's team of researchers studied children growing up on the
island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. They observed them at age 3,
noting how readily they ventured away from their mothers to explore
new toys, how friendly they were to research assistants, how much
conversation they initiated, and whether they played with other kids.
At 11, they tested those same kids again, using IQ tests, school
exams and tests of reading ability, motor skills and attentiveness.
The kids who were most active and gregarious at age 3 registered IQs
12 points higher at age 11. The difference held for both boys and
girls and did not vary by income, ethnic group or family background.</TE>
<TE>   Do curious kids wind up brighter because they learn more by
engaging with the world? Or does the same combination of traits that
makes them inquisitive also make them smarter?</TE>
<TE>   That, researchers don't know. But they do know that getting even
the littlest children involved in physical activity actually seems to
raise their IQ scores.</TE>
<TE>   "We were brought up to think you have a fixed set of brain cells
and they never grow," Raine said. "Now we know that physical exercise
alone leads to the creation of new brain cells. It seems teachers
have known naturally what's good for kids: Get out in the fresh air,
get that blood pumping around in your brain."</TE>
<TE>   But even Raine admits that the concept of "intelligence" is
neither static or narrow, and IQ does not predict a child's future.
The research measured traits most linked to success in the lives of
adults, "but there's so much more we want for our kids than for them
to all grow up to be doctors or lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   As the mother of three girls who were shy and sensitive as
toddlers, I'm wondering what this really means. Because my daughters
weren't rambunctious at 3, should I write off thoughts of the Ivy
League?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not, Raine says. "Just because they're not racing
around, doesn't mean to say the child is doomed to low intelligence."
But it might mean that parents ought to think about ways to encourage
their children to "engage their environment."</TE>
<TE>   "Children today are really like a protected species, not allowed
to go anywhere, to take chances. We're very cautious about letting
them out. In the past, when I was young, we'd hang out after school
with our friends, play games in the street, explore the neighborhood.
Kids today get home from school and sit in front of the TV. We may
have to do a little more to cultivate their intellectual curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't require expensive classes, organized play dates or
interactive computer games. "How many people are taking their kids
out to explore these beautiful mountains we have around Los Angeles?"
Raine says. "Or taking them on a walk and just talking about what you
see?"</TE>
<TE>   Raine is about to see for himself what real life will do to his
theories. He just became a new father to twin boys, 3 weeks old, with
"radically different personalities."</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the first couple days, we could see differences in their
temperaments," he said. "One was so alert, attentive, engaging. The
other was so peaceable and passive. He doesn't even cry when he's
hungry, like 'I don't really want to bother you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Both boys will be encouraged, he says, "to go out and do things,
to explore for themselves, to think creatively. I'm going to try
really hard to encourage their independence."</TE>
<TE>   I wish the good professor well. And I hope he doesn't forget his
own advice the first time there's a meltdown in the parking lot, with
two rambunctious, creative, independent--and very bright, no
doubt--little boys, refusing to stay in their car seats long enough
for daddy to get them home.</TE>

<LD>The Armory Center for the Arts reopened its doors last weekend with a
three-day festival celebrating the completion of a nine-month
renovation. The project, at a cost of $2.4 million, was more than
just a face lift for the onetime home of the National Guard.
Innovative architects Donna Vaccarino and Aleks Istanbullu have given
the 1932 Pasadena landmark a whole new look by reconfiguring the
existing space and adding 6,800 square feet for expanded arts
programs.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a combination of engineering and magic," Armory executive
director Scott Ward said in welcoming the local political gentry and
artists to the opening reception. More than 600 guests turned out for
the April 12 event, which included specialties from local restaurants
and a preview of "New Works, New Spaces," the rejuvenated gallery's
first exhibit, which showcases works by 11 Southland artists.</LD>
<LD>   Among the works: an "ARTS" sign at the entrance created by Wade
Convay from a bullet-riddled metal wall once used for target
practice; a display in the former ammo-storage vault by artist Tamara
Fites titled "U-Store-It," and a chandelier concocted by Lorraine
Cleary with prisms of assorted breast prostheses filled with
hair-styling gel.</LD>
<TE>   Guests included Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and state Sen. Jack
Scott (D-Altadena), armed with the requisite proclamations, and
Armory board president Harvey Knell and his wife, Ellen. Among
artists checking out the scene were Jirayr Zorthian, Bruce Richards,
Helen Pashgian, Eileen Cowin, Gifford Myers and Steve Galloway.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the crowd: Wendy Munger, Lena Kennedy, Maureen and Robert
Carlson, Phoebe and Lawrence Wilson, Susan and John Caldwell, Elisa
and Eric Callow, Martha Williams, Stephen Kanter, Connie Lue, Percy
Clark, David Banis, Carolyn and Scott Cutler, John Dale, Sally and
Bill Hurt, Wesley Jessup, Jeanette O'Malley, Ginger Krueger, Buff
Magaw, Joan and Jeffrey Palmer, Peggy Phelps, Rhonda Stone, Carolyn
and Craig Watson and Rosamund Felsen.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, there was an opportunity to make art at the center
using a Lincoln Town Car donated by attendee Dianne Magee: the
vehicle became the Armory's official pop-mobile when it was painted
with psychedelic colors by young festival-goers.</TE>

<TE>   New Directions</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of New Directions for Women, a residential treatment
center for alcoholics, celebrated its 25th anniversary with an
afternoon tea and a salute to co-founder Muriel Zink.</TE>
<TE>   The Costa Mesa-based center, which includes the new Pamela Wilder
Family Home for women and their children, was the first facility in
Orange County to offer gender-specific treatment, executive director
Jan Christie said during the event at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point.
"Statistics show this is the most effective way to treat women
because they're more likely to explore core issues when men aren't
present," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Zink, 84, tells women alcoholics they are "not guilty for having a
bona-fide disease, but they are responsible for what they do about
it. New Directions gives them the help they need."</TE>
<TE>   The April 10 event sponsored by the facility's Las Socias
Auxiliary raised about $10,000. Proceeds will be used for programs
and services.</TE>
<TE>   Guests also included event chairwoman Lynn Penoyer, Linda
Collister, Lyn Wilder, Allison Wilder, Faith Strong, Cecilia Nott,
Ruth Stafford, Maryanna Jeppe and Allison Carracino.</TE>

<TE>   Race Preview</TE>
<TE>   Lush tropical plants and the festive sounds of a steel drum
provided the backdrop for the "Life Is One Long Weekend" benefit for
the El Viento Foundation at Tommy Bahama's restaurant in Newport
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 guests sipped rum drinks, sampled island fare and bid on
auction items to help raise funds for the foundation, which was
established in 1997 by Jack Shaw and Ellen Shockro of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The organization provides underserved schoolkids with the chance
to participate in marine activities and education programs while
earning credit toward community college scholarships. "If they stay
with the program, keep their grades up, we pay their tuitions," Shaw
said. "This is our way of helping break the cycle of poverty."</TE>
<TE>   The April 13 event was held in conjunction with the upcoming Tommy
Bahama Newport to Ensenada Yacht Race. The foundation is the
beneficiary of the April 26 race, board member Ralph Rodheim said,
who estimates the events will raise $15,000 for El Viento.</TE>

<HD>Clue to Kiddie Show Host: College Will Be a Lot Different</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC OLSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Burns is leaving "Blue's Clues." If you're the parent of a
preschooler, that's a shock. One of the best kiddie shows on
Nickelodeon is losing its host, and there's no guarantee that his
replacement will have a clue.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently Steve didn't want to be another Mr. Rogers, who's been
entertaining kids on PBS since the invention of slippers. Maybe Steve
cringed at the idea of someday zipping up a cardigan over that green,
striped shirt.</LD>
<LD>   So he's leaving after six years--the character will go off to
college, is the story--and the folks at Nick Jr. are working on the
transition to Joe, who will take over April 29. They realize we
parents have to break the news to the little ones, so they've posted
suggestions on the show's Web site. Ideas include making a pretend
phone call to Steve at college, writing to Joe to welcome him and
visiting a local college so our youngsters can get a taste of what
awaits Steve.</LD>
<TE>   Like I'm going to grab my 3-year-old and go stand in line at the
UCI bookstore. The Nick Jr. people should worry less about our
transition and more about Steve's. College may be a harsh change for
someone used to spending every morning playing with Mr. Salt, Mrs.
Pepper and a two-dimensional puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Academically, Steve is in for a jolt. The questions on the Western
Civ test are going to be a little tougher than "Why is Blue angry at
the soup?" and they won't come with three clues, either. He'll also
need a bigger notebook. When the economics professor starts filling
the white board with supply-and-demand graphs, that palm-sized pad
won't be so handy-dandy.</TE>
<TE>   Studying won't be easy for Steve. On the show, he could just open
any book and "skidoo" into its pages, immersing himself in the
content. Someone had better tell him you can't do that with
"Moby-Dick." And on exam day, he can' t count on help from his
thinking chair. No, he'll be sitting at one of those plastic seats
that are the source of so much student unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond classes, Steve's social life will also be shaken up. For
one thing, he can't wear that same striped shirt every day. Someone
at Nick Jr. should help him expand his wardrobe, and if he won't wear
solids, then he should at least switch to jerseys. One big upside:
Now that he's off the show, he can join the rest of us and wear a
SpongeBob SquarePants shirt.</TE>
<TE>   If he's living in a dormitory, Steve will have to get his mail
with more restraint. It was cute on "Blue's Clues" when he sang and
wagged his "tail" every time the mail came, but when he sees letters
in his dormitory mailbox, he'll have to control himself. If he does
that mail jig in the dorm, the other students will flee. Anyway,
isn't it time this guy got online and ignored snail mail like the
rest of us?</TE>
<TE>   The haircut has to go, too. It can be shorter or longer, but that
'tweener look is good for just two things: hosting a kiddie show or
running for James Traficant's congressional seat. Above all, Steve
will have to stop talking to furniture. How's he going to keep a
roommate if he keeps nagging tables?</TE>
<TE>   So, Steve, it's time for "so long." You have some major adjusting
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But the folks at Nick Jr. don't have to worry about us and Joe. No
matter who hosts "Blue's Clues," we know the concept won't change.</TE>
<TE>   The program will still emphasize problem-solving and logical
thinking, and it will still fit perfectly into the Nick Jr. lineup
with shows such as "Dora the Explorer" and "Little Bill," gentle
half-hour programs that teach sharing, thoughtfulness and friendship.</TE>
<TE>   So what will we do if Joe's a real dud? In the spirit of "Blue's
Clues," here are three clues: Tom, Jerry and a hammer. Right. We'll
switch to Cartoon Network!</TE>

<AU>LAILA AL-MARAYATI</AU>
<BD>Laila Al-Marayati is a Los Angeles physician and
spokesperson for the Muslim Women's League.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While in Monterey last week, I was drawn to a mural alongside a bike
path. It depicted the history of the region, starting with images of
the Native American tribes indigenous to the area and continuing from
there. Looking around, I saw no one who resembled the members of
those early tribes, long wiped out by disease, starvation and the
abuses of early California settlers. It suddenly occurred to me, as a
Palestinian American, that some day, years from now, my history and
heritage could be reduced to images on a wall for tourists to
admire--in Jerusalem, perhaps. Renewed attempts by the Israeli army
in recent days to eradicate whole villages in my father's native
Palestine made me wonder if the mural before me foreshadowed the
future.</LD>
<LD>   Back in my hotel room, I turned on the television for the latest
updates. On every channel, pundits justified Israeli incursions into
the West Bank. The resulting slaughter got barely a mention. The
Israelis are acting in self-defense, the commentators said. If
Americans were subject to suicide bombings within their borders,
wouldn't they do the same? But these rationalizations have become an
endorsement of collective punishment.</LD>
<TE>   Today, most Americans do not believe that the decimation and
expulsion of entire Indian tribes in response to "terrorist" attacks
against wagon trains was justified. But, as one caller to a
syndicated radio program suggested, since we're not about to give
anything back to the Indians, why should the Israelis be expected to
return stolen land to the Palestinians?</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because we live in a different time and place. The U.S.
government could not massively displace Native Americans now, in a
time of blanket media coverage, international and civil rights law.
We would become worldwide pariahs for committing such egregious human
rights violations against an indigenous population. Fortunately for
expansionists, such pressures were not at play 150 years ago. America
is what it is, and now we draw pictures on the wall, set up special
museums and publish politically correct textbooks to tell the truth
and lament the sins of our forefathers. Revenues from lucrative
casinos notwithstanding, many of today's Native Americans struggle
with poverty, alcoholism, joblessness and other social ills. Attempts
at reparations have been woefully inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting in Washington, D.C., a pro-Israel conservative once
told me that the Palestinians just have to accept defeat, because in
this world, "there are winners and there are losers." In other words,
the sooner the Palestinians admit that they have lost, the better.
Let Israel annex the West Bank and Gaza Strip and confine
Palestinians to reservation-like towns. Eventually, curious onlookers
from Israel and elsewhere could come to observe the "natives" in
their "natural habitat," sample their cuisine, maybe volunteer in
social-service or education programs and leave satisfied with
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, perhaps, fits of consciousness-raising might
result in books about the deliberate Israeli destruction of
Palestinian society. Scholars and collectors would covet Palestinian
embroidery, which has an appeal similar to the fine artifacts made by
American Indian tribes. Preserving and valuing artifacts would be
seen as proof that Palestinian contributions were finally being
recognized. Superficial celebrations of Palestinian culture would
masquerade as displays of respect for the Palestinian people,
absolving Israelis of the responsibility to do anything meaningful
and truly conciliatory, like enabling Palestinian families to return
to their homes (for which they have legal deeds) in places like
Haifa, Jaffa or Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians today are resisting attempts to transform them into
an anthropological curiosity. It seems like time is not on their
side. Illegal settlements continue to be built on their land. The
institutions of civil society are being dismantled or destroyed as
Israel has reoccupied the West Bank and Gaza, and the U.S.
government, unwilling to seriously pressure Israel, acts as an
accomplice to the crime. Even U.S. Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell's recent visit ended without condemnation of Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's goal of bringing the Palestinians to their
knees to force a surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Like their Native American counterparts, the Palestinians are a
proud people who will fight until the bitter end. They will use
whatever means they have at their disposal, with no champions other
than each other. Perhaps this conflict will end like others before
it, where the stronger party subjugates the weaker into complete
submission.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps not. Today, satellite television and the Internet
expose these current atrocities to the world in real time. In
response, people of conscience who reject apologists for the brutal
Israeli occupation, people who refuse to accept the "inevitable"
defeat of Palestinian resistance and realize that the loss of a
people diminishes us all, must intervene and make a difference. Maybe
this time the history books will tell a different story, and, instead
of showing my children pictures of their ancestral homeland, I will
be able to take them there.</TE>

<HD>What's Missing? A Strategy for Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI ALPHER</AU>
<BD>Yossi Alpher is former director of the Jaffee Center
for Strategic Studies. He co-edits bitterlemons.org, an
Israeli-Palestinian Web-based dialogue.</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell failed to achieve a
cease-fire and to restart a peace process between Israelis and
Palestinians last week, because none of the three key
leaders--Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat and, yes, President Bush--has a realistic
strategic commitment to peace.</LD>
<LD>   Powell registered some important achievements. He appears to have
persuaded Syria to restrain Hezbollah's provocative attacks against
northern Israel. He successfully launched the idea of a future
regional or international conference to discuss the groundbreaking
Saudi peace initiative. And his very journey signifies that the
administration is beginning to take its megapower responsibilities
more seriously and abandon its hands-off attitude toward the violence
in the Middle East. President Bush now has one foot in the arena.</LD>
<LD>   But if the U.S. is going to try to move Arafat and Sharon onto the
peace track, it will have to work harder.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat has no strategy for peace. He seeks to delegitimize Israel
as a Jewish state, and he relies on extreme violence to achieve this
aim. Arafat, together with much of the Arab and Muslim world and a
few European leftists, fully equates deliberate Palestinian targeting
of Israeli civilians--we now have documentation of his deep
involvement in the detailed planning of suicide bombings--with the
regrettable civilian casualties caused by legitimate Israeli acts of
self-defense. There is a weighty moral-equivalency issue here, which
puts the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--along with America's war in
Afghanistan--on the cutting edge of the clash of civilizations.</TE>
<TE>   But there is more to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than
terrorism. There is also a conflict over land that pits an
anachronistic Israeli occupation and settlement strategy against a
Palestinian war of liberation. Here we encounter Sharon's lack of a
strategy for peace. Over the past three decades, Sharon has managed
Israel's settlement policy with the clearly articulated goal of
preventing the emergence of a demographically and geographically
contiguous Palestinian state. In parallel, in his attempt to
eliminate Arafat and dismantle the Palestinian Authority, Sharon
seeks to fragment and humiliate the Palestinian leadership and
replace it with docile, collaborationist leaders.</TE>
<TE>   We've been down this road with Sharon before, when he was minister
of defense: in Lebanon in 1982, and when he set up the abortive
Village Leagues Palestinian leadership in 1981 and then watched as
all the Palestinian leaders he appointed resigned or were
assassinated. Sharon's latest grand design is again destined to
collapse like a house of cards. It took Israel 18 years to climb out
of the Lebanese morass. How long will it take to repair the strategic
damage Sharon is currently wreaking?</TE>
<TE>   The current Israeli military offensive is justified and has been a
success at the operational level. The Israel Defense Forces have
decimated genuine terrorist concentrations. Israel has nothing to
apologize for if Palestinian civilians and their houses were caught
tragically in the destructive battle at the Jenin refugee camp; the
Palestinians knew perfectly well that they were living in the world's
top terrorist base for suicide bombers. But at the political level,
the Israeli operation is a failure. Arafat is widely seen as an
embattled hero. Israel has lost support worldwide, its economy has
been severely traumatized and Israeli-American relations are frayed.
Worst of all, the human suffering caused by the operation will
produce a new generation of Palestinians dedicated to fighting
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In view of Sharon's and Arafat's lack of strategic will to move
forward politically, Powell will need more than good intentions to
succeed. He will need clout in the form of a presidential decision to
exert more U.S. pressure on Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and he will need to seek out and encourage additional
Arab and European pressure on Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon will have to be pushed to allow for the immediate
introduction of a significant political element into cease-fire
negotiations, and he must withdraw Israeli forces from areas occupied
during the recent fighting, including from Arafat's compound. He will
have to signal to the Palestinians that negotiations, when they
resume, will touch on all the issues abandoned when the violence
started.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat will have to be pressured to abandon violence convincingly,
in deed as well as in word, and to refrain from bringing to the table
positions that delegitimize Israel, like the right of return for 1948
Palestinian refugees and the denial of a binding Jewish link to the
Temple Mount.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure on Arafat should involve the withholding of vital funds,
coupled with threats to cut all ties with the PLO and its leadership
and close down its diplomatic operations worldwide. As for Israel,
U.S. public diplomacy may suffice: The Israeli public traditionally
frowns upon an Israeli leader who spoils relations with the country's
only strategic ally.</TE>
<TE>   Pressures of this nature will only be exercised when President
Bush concludes that he has no alternative but to place his other foot
in the arena as well and fully commit Washington to the task of
ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This will happen only when
the entire administration accepts that its broader goals in the
region--and particularly the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq--are
contingent on Israelis and Palestinians moving toward peace.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the task will be far from simple. A commitment by Bush
will not change the fundamental negative strategic concepts of Arafat
and Sharon. Only Palestinians and Israelis, most of whom are indeed
prepared to compromise for peace, can change their respective
leadership, and this may take time. Yet, meanwhile, we are
backsliding helplessly toward uncontrolled escalation and chaos.
Disaster in Jerusalem and Ramallah will not be an isolated event in
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that only the U.S. can begin to reverse the process.</TE>

<HD>The Rules of Engagement</HD>
<DH>To bomb any Afghan target deemed "sensitive," commanders in
the field must get permission from officials in the U.S. Welcome to
the new age of military micromanagement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a senior fellow at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in
Washington and an adjunct professor at the U.S. Air Force School of
Advanced Airpower Studies. He is also a consultant to a number of
nongovernmental organizations.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When bombing began in Afghanistan last year, Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld retained the right to personally approve attacks on any
and all "sensitive" targets. By the second day of bombing, approvals
by Rumsfeld had proved unworkable, and authority over sensitive
targets was handed down to the Florida-based commander in chief of
the U.S. operation, Army Gen. Tommy Franks. In November, Franks got
permission to delegate it a half-step further down--to a staff
operations officer in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   But at no time, even today, has the ostensible commander of the
air war, who is based in Saudi Arabia, had the authority to attack
the broad array of targets classified as "sensitive" without prior
approval from Washington or Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to the new age of micromanagement.</LD>
<TE>   For many in the Bush administration, the Afghanistan war has been
an unqualified success. But what's happening now in upper reaches of
the Pentagon gives new force to the old saying that you learn more
from defeat than from victory.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to "lessons learned," Operation Enduring Freedom may
prove to have been a dangerous victory. That the war's many-layered
control system likely got in the way of a far more decisive outcome
may be forgotten: What will be remembered is simply our quick routing
of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that victory, questions about micromanagement are
apparently unwelcome at the top--despite the fact that most of the
senior Taliban leadership, as well as the bulk of Al Qaeda forces,
got away.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to hear about the cost of having battlefield
decisions made on the other side of the world by busy officials who
have no direct feel for what is happening. Complaints are dismissed
as military petulance or--worse--as uniformed officers challenging
civilian control.</TE>
<TE>   If the issue of micromanagement is not addressed, however, the
future cost could be high. The control system employed in the air war
in Afghanistan will shape the system used next time. And carrying
that system forward against a far more capable foe like Iraq could
have a high price, both in reduced military effectiveness and in risk
to American lives.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is ripe with irony. Up to now, micromanagement of
combat has been associated primarily with Vietnam, when President
Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, spent hours poring over maps to
personally select targets for U.S. warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans vowed to leave the fighting of subsequent wars to the
professionals. The first President Bush did just that, developing a
control system for the air war in Desert Storm that protected wider
national interests but trusted uniformed military in the field to
make targeting decisions.</TE>
<TE>   What is happening today, as one senior officer put it, is "back to
the future," a return to the Vietnam-era distrust of military
commanders and excessive involvement by Washington in daily
decisions. His concerns about micromanagement were shared by a number
of senior Defense Department and military officers interviewed for
this piece.</TE>
<TE>   The high degree of Washington oversight is reflected both in
highly classified "rules of engagement" and in presidential
directives governing Operation Enduring Freedom, some of which I have
seen, while others have been read to me or described in detail by
senior officials with access.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that, with ultimate target approval lying
half a world and many time zones away, numerous decisions on
launching attacks got bogged down until it was too late. Also, with
the CIA's Predator reconnaissance drones sending real-time imagery to
both the air command center in Saudi Arabia and to U.S. Central
Command (CentCom) in Florida, time-consuming discussions back and
forth were almost inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem was that the CIA, Florida and CentCom all thought
they were choking the chicken," one exasperated officer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post, for example, reported a case in which Air
Force targeters had identified a column of Taliban reinforcements
moving over open ground, but CentCom worried that the movement seemed
so obvious it might be a trick. As the Rules of Engagement were
written, that was enough to scuttle the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Rules of engagement are formal documents that outline when, where,
how, why and against whom force may be used. They also spell out
restrictions on its use because of political, diplomatic or legal
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   These rules are some of the most closely held elements of any war,
since knowing our rules of engagement can help an enemy. Some are so
sensitive that they are only conveyed to a commander in person or by
secure telephone.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces generally operate under the so-called Standing Rules
of Engagement, the basic directives first issued by the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff in October 1994, and revised in January 2000. The
standing rules state that all U.S. forces "will comply with the Law
of War during ... armed conflict, no matter how the conflict may be
characterized under international law." In addition, further rules
are promulgated for each theater, and even more specific ones are
developed for individual operations.</TE>
<TE>   A recent internal Pentagon memorandum dealing with the formulation
of rules of engagement, for example, notes that attacks on certain
targets or the use of particular weapons may be restricted "so as not
to needlessly shame or antagonize the enemy, tilt allied or U.S.
public opinion in a particular direction or escalate hostilities."</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, according to senior officials, special rules of
engagement were shaped by the administration's desire to avoid giving
the impression that the United States was attacking Islam as a whole.
The rules also reflected concern that destruction of Afghan
infrastructure could contribute to civilian suffering after the war.</TE>
<TE>   No one I've interviewed questioned these concerns. Senior
commanders understand that war can affect wider U.S. interests. And
no one questioned the appropriateness of having civilian authorities
make policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   What many senior officers do question is whether meeting these
valid concerns required a cumbersome control system that impeded the
military's ability to achieve other U.S. goals--including greater
damage to terrorists and their supporters.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, senior warfare commanders feel that--based on their
training and on lessons learned in conflicts from Vietnam through
Desert Storm to the former Yugoslavia--they can be trusted to make
decisions about "sensitive targets" on their own. That operational
freedom, they argue, would have allowed U.S. forces to hit legitimate
targets faster and with better results.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, while the nominal commander of the air war was in Saudi
Arabia--in close contact with the fast-changing situation in
Afghanistan and with the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine units
delivering air power in the region--decisions had to wait upon
officials thousands of miles away in Florida and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   To understand how broad the "sensitive" target category was,
consider the first special rules of engagement issued for Enduring
Freedom. Called Serial 1 and issued by the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff on Oct. 6, the day before the bombing began, these
rules defined "sensitive" targets as "infrastructure," including
electrical power systems, roads and industry--ordinarily the primary
targets in a war.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive targets also included any associated with Taliban
leadership that might have "political implications." Attacks on
mosques were banned, even if they were being used for military
purposes by the Taliban or Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   After a draft of these restrictions circulated in late September,
the White House added the provision reserving final decisions on
sensitive targets to Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   For many senior officers, all this is a reversion to the mistrust
and micromanagement of Vietnam. The political and other concerns
reflected in the rules were not necessarily different from those of
the Clinton years. But many senior officers had expected better of
the new Bush team.</TE>
<TE>   Since Vietnam, these commanders pointed out, training on the laws
of war has become a major element at every level of the armed forces.
And over time, a system of centralized command for joint air
operations has developed.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the Persian Gulf War, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf
praised then-President George Bush for allowing the military to
"fight this war exactly as it should have been fought." If Gen.
Franks made such a statement about the second President Bush, many of
his most senior commanders would respond with rueful smiles.</TE>

Colombia.</BD>
<DL>CARACAS</DL>
<LD>In the early days of April, the coming coup against Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez was an open secret. On the night of April 9,
near the offices of the state-run oil company where thousands of
Venezuelans had gathered to demand Chavez's resignation, a man
approached me. "The table is set," he said mysteriously.</LD>
<LD>   He introduced himself as retired Gen. Manuel Andara Clavier. He'd
served as inspector general of the armed forces until 1994, when he
stepped down. He said he headed a group of retired military officials
who opposed Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything is set for the military to let the president know he
can't push this country to spill blood," he said. He then handed me a
Venezuelan flag and recommended I call him after his predictions came
true.</LD>
<TE>   Two days later, Chavez was arrested, and Pedro Carmona, head of
Fedecamaras, the nation's largest business group, declared himself
interim president, promptly suspending the constitution, disbanding
the National Assembly and removing the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning, my telephone rang. "See, I told you the
table was set. You should have called me, and I could have given you
more details," Andara Clavier said.</TE>
<TE>   But he hadn't anticipated the next course. Fewer than 48 hours
after he was deposed, Chavez returned to power on a wave of support
from the nation's poorest citizens, confirming Venezuela's place as
one of the hemisphere's most polarized countries.</TE>
<TE>   That the coup and counter-coup happened so rapidly is a reflection
of the deep divisions and resentments most Venezuelans feel these
days. In a country where more than half of the citizens are
impoverished, where the economy is in shambles and where huge
protests have become daily occurrences, it is no surprise that people
harbor deep ambivalence about their leaders--especially Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Himself the leader of a failed coup in 1992, Chavez was elected
president in 1998 by an overwhelming majority of Venezuelans,
particularly the poor, who felt betrayed by a two-party system that
turned a deaf ear to their complaints. The fiery populist vowed to
lift his followers out of poverty. He railed against the United
States, criticizing Washington's "savage neoliberalism," and
maintained close friendships with Libyan and Cuban leaders. But in
recent months, his popularity had plummeted to below 40%, as many
Venezuelans lost faith in his ability to solve the problems he railed
against. And so, Venezuela's business and political elite seized the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   In the days leading up to the first coup, my interviews with
political, business and military leaders were frequently interrupted
by urgent telephone calls about "transitional governments" or the
actions of military police. The day before Chavez's arrest, my
interview with the former president of the state-run oil company,
Gen. Guaicaipuro Lameda, was interrupted by his aide. "It's a family
member, you have to talk to him," the assistant said nervously,
handing Lameda a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the general refused, but the aide insisted. "I see.
Thank you," Lameda said into the phone after a pause. After hanging
up, he told me the call was from an officer who was present when an
order was issued to send the military intelligence police after him.</TE>
<TE>   Lameda knew the inside workings of the presidential
administration, having resigned last February to protest Chavez's
autocratic management style. He assumed Chavez was sending the police
to prevent him from appearing on television later in the day, when he
planned to appeal to the military to choose sides in the growing
tensions between Chavez's supporters and his opponents. The general
insisted he was not advocating a coup, but acknowledged that Chavez's
opponents were hoping to attract ever-greater numbers of protesters
to their demonstrations. Then the president might have to crack down,
and the military would be forced to decide whether or not to enforce
Chavez's orders.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Carmona called for a large protest march in Caracas
the next day. In a speech to an estimated 200,000 protesters, he
urged the demonstrators to march to Miraflores, the presidential
palace where Chavez supporters had turned out to express their
loyalty. "There is no going back," Carmona said.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters I talked to that day hadn't turned out to force a
coup. To a person--engineers, housewives and laborers alike--they
said the country's economic situation was unbearable. Some bystanders
were skeptical, though, that protests can solve anything. "How do I
know what comes next will be any better?" asked a dishwasher. "I'm
not happy with Chavez, but I don't trust them [the marchers],
either."</TE>
<TE>   Violence erupted soon after the marchers arrived at Miraflores. In
an address from inside the palace, Chavez called for calm. All the
nation's privately owned television stations broadcast his speech, as
required by law, but they split the screen with images of marchers
being pummeled by troops outside the palace. Then Chavez announced he
was shutting down TV stations opposed to his government because they
had failed to comply with broadcasting guidelines. Suddenly,
television screens went blank.</TE>
<TE>   The next 24 hours were chaos. The streets were vacant; sporadic
shooting could be heard. On cable television and radio stations, 46
military leaders denounced the violence and the president, whom they
blamed for the deaths of at least 15 protesters that day. They said
they no longer would recognize Chavez's authority.</TE>
<TE>   It was at this point that the United States behaved shamelessly.
Make no mistake about it: Chavez is a tough guy to admire. His foot
is forever finding its way to his mouth. His are the politics of
anger, of capitalizing on Venezuela's deep social divisions to pit
rich against poor, while offering few solutions. Still, he was the
democratically elected president of Venezuela, and the U.S. should
have condemned his illegal overthrow.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the U.S. officials shed no tears over Chavez's
ouster, even suggesting that he had brought it on himself, but when
Chavez returned to power, U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza
Rice lectured him on the need to "respect constitutional processes."
She said this after Carmona, whom the U.S. applauded, had virtually
suspended the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   In Venezuela, there is widespread belief among Chavez supporters
that the U.S. was involved in the coup. It is a belief some Chavez
opponents are eager to promote.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the first coup, three men approached me at an
anti-Chavez protest. Learning that I was a journalist, they told me
they were part of a conspiracy to oust Chavez. "We can't give you our
names," said one of them, who wore his baseball cap backward. They
then told me that, over the next three days, a high-ranking official
from each of the branches of the armed forces would come out against
the president. I asked them if they thought the United States would
support a coup. The man with the baseball cap took it off and turned
it around so I could read the words on its front: "President George
W. Bush." He smiled and walked away.</TE>
<TE>   While Chavez may or may not win the next time he runs for office,
he still retains a strong base of support, particularly among the
nation's poor, a reality the U.S. cannot ignore without risk. Sitting
outside a makeshift bar in the western hills of Catia, a Chavez
stronghold, Luis Manzano, 42, denounced the violence but insisted
that both Chavez and his political party will go on. "I still support
my president and commander-in-chief Hugo Chavez," said Manzano.</TE>
<TE>   His words were repeated by dozens of "Chavistas" in Caracas'
barrios. Chavez was the first president who spoke to the poor, they
told me: He said he was one of them. He was not ashamed to be a part
of the "pueblo" in a country where European-sounding names and light
skin are often coveted.</TE>
<TE>   If Chavez was naive in believing that his support among the poor
could protect him from plots to oust him, his opponents were equally
naive to believe that those supporters were powerless to stop his
overthrow. Now both sides will be more wary. But it's unlikely that
the recent upheaval will have any long-term effect other than to
widen the divide between the classes.</TE>

<BD>Los Angeles journalist Gale Holland surveys the
right-wing and left-wing press each month for Opinion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember after Sept. 11, how we all were going to get along? Well,
somebody forgot to tell the ideologues the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Right and left political fulminators are at it as usual, this time
railing about dueling volumes on the U.S. bestseller lists. It's an
odd moment politically, when diatribes from both the right and left
are flying off bookstore shelves. There are the conservative tomes:
Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly's "No Spin Zone," former CBS
correspondent Bernard Goldberg's "Bias," an exploration of liberal
media slant, and Sept. 11 victim Barbara Olson's anti-Clinton "The
Final Days." The abundance of riches from the right is "enough to
take your breath away," Stanley Kurtz, in the right-leaning National
Review Online, exulted.</LD>
<TE>   But left scribes have been tapping those keys as well: There's
David Brock's "Blinded by the Right" and Michael Moore's "Stupid
White Men." Even Kurtz had to concede they're out there: "The Left is
back--and it's mad," he wrote. By April 7, the New York Times
bestseller list looked like a right-left horse race: "White Men," by
lefty populist Moore (of "Roger and Me" fame), was at No. 1, "Bias"
followed at No. 3, with "Blinded" close on its heels in the No. 4
slot. Coming up on the inside rail were "Shakedown," an investigative
biography of the Rev. Jesse Jackson by conservative gadfly Kenneth R.
Timmerman, and right-wing populist Patrick J. Buchanan's
anti-immigrant broadside "The Death of the West."</TE>
<TE>   One suspects that the popularity of these books has less to do
with ideological fervor than with the modern taste for World
Wrestling Federation-style smack-downs. Moore's pre-Sept. 11
"Thief-in-Chief" diatribe, which his publisher unsuccessfully tried
to water down, features an open letter asking Bush whether he is a
functional illiterate, whether he is a felon and whether he is
getting the drug and alcohol counseling he needs. In "Bias,"
Goldberg, a middle-aged, conservative white guy, describes his former
employer: "If CBS were a prison ... three-quarters of the producers
and 100% of the vice presidents would be Dan [Rather]'s bitches."</TE>
<TE>   Whether raucously entertaining or just cranks, these authors are
catnip for right and left magazines and Web sites, not the least
because most of them feature a sexy subtext of betrayal. "Blinded"
author Brock is the former American Spectator "investigative" writer
who smeared Anita Hill as "a little bit nutty and a little bit
slutty." His Troopergate/Gov. Clinton sexcapades story smoked out
Paula Jones, leading indirectly to the Clinton impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   Now in "Blinded," Brock tells us that Hillary Rodham Clinton was
right about the "vast right-wing conspiracy"--and he was its hit man.
Brock's apostasy has been a long time coming: He first apologized for
his Hill hit piece in 1997, and he has published several magazine mea
culpas since. The big question now is who do you believe? Brock, the
right-wing hit man? Or Brock, the born-again penitent? Robert L.
Borosage, in the liberal American Prospect, comes down squarely on
the side of the new Brock, insisting he has something more important
to say than I'm sorry.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'vast right-wing conspiracy' against Clinton isn't news,"
Borosage wrote. "More important is what Brock describes in passing:
the ... arrangements that enable the right to drive the political
debate."</TE>
<TE>   The right's relative hush on Brock's book suggests that he's
telling the truth, Michael Tomasky said in the leftist magazine The
Nation. "My hunch is that they hope they can bury it with their
silence," Tomasky wrote. "That tells me that David Brock, while no
longer right, is, in fact, right as rain."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Tomasky just hasn't been reading the right right writers.
While there have been few, if any, point-by-point refutations of
Brock's book, the right has missed no opportunity to impugn the
conservative turncoat. National Review editor William F. Buckley Jr.
implied that Brock was unreliable. "The new book turning, apparently,
this way and that, on this and that, redefining the Brockian view of
things," the mandarin conservative dean sniffed.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative media watchdog L. Brent Bozell III savaged Brock and
Bill Clinton in the same breath. "Clinton earned his bad reputation,
and Brock has cemented his with this sloppy, bitter, vengeful little
book," Bozell said on his Web site mediaresearch.org. Bozell failed
to disclose, however, that the conservative foundations that funded
Brock's anti-Clinton assault also help keep his own Media Research
Center afloat, mediawhoresonline.com, a watchdog group, noted.</TE>
<TE>   But it took one of Brock's former colleagues, former American
Spectator managing editor Wlady Pleszczynski, to sign a real
poison-pen review: "Even Brock wouldn't have been awestruck by
Brock--badly stooped shoulders, pasty complexion and a formless mouth
that's been lying too long," Pleszczynski sniped on the conservative
site americanprowler.org. "Old friends worry about Brock's future. I
don't. Yasser Arafat is bound to need a new spokesman."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's "Bias" is also a betrayal, of the media that gave him a
professional home for 28 years. Eric Alterman, MSNBC commentator and
Nation columnist, led the anti-Goldberg charge. "A number-one
best-seller is indeed an impressive accomplishment for a clumsily
written screed whose author never even bothers to prove his thesis,
much less attempts to convince anyone who does not already know the
conservative secret handshake."</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Nunberg, in American Prospect, took on Goldberg's claim
that conservatives are labeled more frequently than liberals because
of a lefty media bias. A database search of 20 major U.S. dailies, he
wrote, revealed that "the average liberal legislator has a better
than 30% greater likelihood of being given a political label than the
average conservative does." Ditto liberal actors, judges and
columnists.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, though, that however you cherry-pick the groups,
there's no way to make the survey come out as Goldberg claims it
should, where conservatives are systematically labeled more than
liberals are," Nunberg concluded. "If the media wind up labeling
liberals somewhat more than conservatives, that's chiefly an
indication of how phobic they've become about charges of bias from
the right."</TE>
<TE>   The right, however, sees "liberal bias" and "media" as redundant
terms. National Review Online's Jonah Goldberg (no relation) said he
hadn't yet read "Bias," but that's OK, because he "pretty much know
what it's going to say.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is everybody knows that Dan Rather is an egomaniacal
liberal. Everybody knows that the major news networks lean to the
left," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Alterman, however, pointed out that the self-same Goldberg (Jonah,
not Bernard) just signed on as a regular commentator at CNN, the
network GOP leader Tom DeLay calls the "Communist News Network." And
not everybody on the right is on board the pro-"Bias" train.
Executive editor Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard, perhaps still
clinging to those warm, fuzzy, let's-all-get-along feelings of the
recent past, mused that the book's main argument has been undercut by
the media's response to Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd never have guessed from "Bias" (written months before Sept.
11) that Dan Rather would emerge as the war on terrorism's leading
media supporter," Barnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore and Buchanan are populists who dwell on the outer fringes of
their respective left and right camps. Not surprisingly, the attacks
on them have come from their more mainstream ideological allies.</TE>
<TE>   The ubiquitous Jonah Goldberg accused Buchanan of mirroring the
identity politics of the left.</TE>
<TE>   "Buchanan's new book ... spends an awful lot of time talking about
how European-Americans, by which he means white Christians (Asian,
Hispanic and African Christians don't count) are being besieged by a
tidal wave of cultural, political and demographic trends," Goldberg
says. But then he admits he has not finished Buchanan's book, either,
which raises a question: Is Goldberg a reading lightweight, or are
the current political screeds not all that entertaining?</TE>
<TE>   Even Moore's critics concede "Stupid White Men" is a good read.
"Biting satire," according to Ben Fritz of spinsanity.org, a
left-leaning, but equal-opportunity GOP/Dem-bashing media watchdog
site. But Fritz says that Moore's otherwise welcome dissent was
marred by factual errors and stolen material.</TE>
<TE>   "Just how did Moore get so many of his facts wrong?" Fritz asked
in a commentary also published on Web magazine Salon. "Lazy cribbing
from media outlets and the Internet seems the most likely culprit."</TE>
<TE>   Appearing on CNN's Lou Dobbs show, Moore responded to Fritz's
charge by invoking the satire exemption. Here is spinsanity's partial
transcript of the conversation:</TE>
<TE>   MOORE: ... How can there be inaccuracy in comedy? You know.</TE>
<TE>   DOBBS: That does give one license ....Filled with glaring
inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   MOORE: Filled with glaring, comedic inaccuracies. And actually
written by sweatshop workers in Honduras. Has that been pointed out
yet? I think we might as well reveal all right now.</TE>
<TE>   Factually challenged though the books may be, NRO's Kurtz believes
we're going to see a lot more "Stupid White Men"-style broadsides.
The war on terrorism, he believes, could spur the next crop.</TE>
<TE>   "In time, I expect, we'll see a best-seller list filled with books
that try to make sense of the war from competing cultural
perspectives," Kurtz said. Is that a warning--or a threat?</TE>

<HD>Merchants of Fear Bite the Hand That Sustains Israel</HD>

<AU>JONATHAN D. JACOBY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan D. Jacoby is a consultant for Jewish
organizations.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In my 30 years of working on behalf of Israel, I cannot remember a
time when an administration official was repeatedly forced by
hecklers to stop speaking at a major pro-Israel rally--until last
week. At the Solidarity with Israel rally in Washington, U.S. Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, one of the Jewish community's
most steadfast allies, was booed and jeered by rabble rousers when he
said "innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying in great numbers
as well."</LD>
<LD>   The disrespect shown Wolfowitz appalled the demonstration's
organizers. They quickly reminded the crowd that the rally was not a
protest against U.S. Mideast policy but an occasion to support the
war against terror and express solidarity with Israel. Still, the
implications of the incident are troubling, because what happened to
Wolfowitz is symptomatic of a new trend that could have serious
consequences for the U.S.-Israel relationship</LD>
<TE>   The seeds of Wolfowitz's treatment were planted long before last
week's rally. Though it may seem absurd, some activists in the
American Jewish community and Israel have worked hard to create the
false impression that the United States is coercing Israel to act
against its own interests. Incredibly, they are arousing fears that
Israel's most trusted and loyal ally may abandon the Jewish state. To
most of the world, this is ridiculous. Yet today, a small and growing
number of American Jews believe it, leading them to distrust the
administration and encouraging partisan divisions on issues related
to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this derives from a lobbying campaign to undermine Bush
administration policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The U.S.
has rightly criticized and exerted enormous pressure on Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat to act forcefully to end the
terrorist attacks on Israel. At the same time, the administration
realizes that Arafat remains a key Palestinian decision-maker. He
simply cannot be excluded from the peace process at this time if it
is to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   But there are some Jewish activists who believe that Arafat and
the Palestinian leadership can and should be militarily defeated.
They have attempted to draw a direct parallel between Osama bin Laden
and Arafat, between the Taliban and the Palestinian Authority. Such a
nefarious association, in effect, makes all current Palestinian
political entities and leaders eternal enemies of the Jewish state.
Any U.S. effort to negotiate with them, therefore, is an anti-Israel
act. "The assumption of the past decade that the Palestinians were
ultimately committed to a negotiated settlement with Israel has been
proven tragically misguided," a Jewish leader said recently.</TE>
<TE>   This idea has a far more powerful champion. While U.S. Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell was shuttling between meetings with Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Arafat, former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu declared, "The only way to defeat" Arafat and the
current Palestinian leadership "is to destroy" them. Netanyahu, who
went to Washington to be the rally's featured speaker, made a point
of lauding U.S. leadership in the fight against terror. "No greater
friend of Israel has ever been in the White House" than President
Bush, he proclaimed. But Netanyahu has also been leading a campaign
of veiled criticism of the administration's Middle East policies. A
week earlier, he protested before the U.S. Senate: "Though we are
assured by friends that we have the right to defend ourselves, we are
effectively asked not to exercise that right."</TE>
<TE>   In essence, a former Israeli prime minister accused the U.S.
government of denying Israel its right to self-defense. Yet, few, if
any, Jewish officials protested Netanyahu's insinuation.</TE>
<TE>   This silence was deafening to those in the Jewish community who
believe that the United States has a critical mediating role to play
in the Mideast, a role that complements, rather than conflicts with,
the special friendship and strategic alliance of the U.S. and Israel.
Even more worrisome were the voices of American Jewish activists who
echoed Netanyahu's intimation that the U.S. was acting against
Israel's interests. One organizational leader went so far as to
suggest that by placing "a time limit on Israel's acts of
self-defense," the administration would be hampering "Israel's
legitimate right of self-defense."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu's views, to be sure, are far more rigid than those of
most American Jews. But by fueling fears that the United States is
ignoring Israel's security needs and denying it the right of
self-defense, he has won over many in the pro-Israel community.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, when some Jewish leaders criticized President Bush
for affirming the U.S. vision of a Palestinian state alongside
Israel, a serious crisis between the Jewish community and the
administration almost broke out. The tensions were exacerbated when
Sharon warned the administration not "to appease the Arabs at our
expense," an allusion to the infamous appeasement of Adolf Hitler in
Munich that paved the way for Germany to march into Czechoslovakia in
1938.</TE>
<TE>   The administration worked with Jewish and Israeli leaders to patch
up any differences, particularly after the war in Afghanistan began.
American Jews instinctively strive for a positive relationship with
an administration, and they greatly appreciate Bush's pro-Israel
policies. Nevertheless, continual intimations that the U.S. might
abandon Israel, combined with criticisms, direct and indirect, of
administration actions, eventually created an atmosphere that made
the Wolfowitz flap inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the spirit of its citizens is key to Israel's survival,
so, too, is the Jewish state's most important strategic asset--its
relationship with the United States. If left unchecked, the new myth
of undue U.S. pressure on Israel will hurt that relationship. There
is a real danger that the fear of America abandoning Israel will be
reinforced by the anxiety that virtually all of us feel during these
traumatic times, as anti-Semitism again rears its hideous head and
violence is perpetrated against Jews in Israel, in Europe and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, that apprehension has already started to provoke
distrust and suspicion of our closest allies. As a result, one of our
community's best friends, and the administration he represents, was
berated for reminding pro-Israel Americans that "hard decisions must
be made by both sides to achieve a lasting peace."</TE>

<AU>MIKE MALES</AU>
<BD>Mike Males, Justice Policy Institute senior researcher,
teaches sociology at UC Santa Cruz.</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>Ron Powers fears his hometown of Hannibal, Mo. He moved to Vermont
because he feared New York. Now he fears Vermont. The source of his
alarm is the subject of an article he wrote for the Atlantic Monthly:
"The Apocalypse of Adolescence." Violence by "ordinary teens" from
"ordinary communities" constitutes a "new mutation in the evolution
of the murderous American adolescent," declares Powers. "While we
sleep, go about our business, leave our doors unlocked, children are
prowling the landscape with knives," warned a "60 Minutes II" report.</LD>
<LD>   Ephebiphobia--extreme fear of youth--is a full-blown media panic.
Images of "ordinary" teenagers besieging grown-up havens are
everywhere. Time magazine warns of gun-toting "monsters next door."
The Times and "60 Minutes II" depict vicious young wastoids plotting
terrors in pastoral sanctuaries. Teens are lost to heroin (ABC News,
CNN), engage in random promiscuity in junior high school (USA Today,
"Dateline NBC"), drink dangerously (Associated Press) and are just
plain mean (The New York Times Magazine, ABC "20/20").</LD>
<TE>   "Middle-class kids" are the ones "who most frighten and outrage
adults these days," proclaims Rolling Stone contributing editor
Randall Sullivan. "Kids are smiling at you one day, and the next
thing you know, they've killed somebody," a Rialto, Calif., neighbor
said of a teen sentenced for beating an elderly woman to death. "In
the '60s," L.A. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks told LA Youth, "rarely
did we ever see violent crime" by teens. Today, "there is significant
youth violence." Not surprisingly, polls show adults believe that
youth violence is up, that youths commit half of all violent crime
and that most schools are vulnerable to mass shootings. One-third
fear personal victimization by youths.</TE>
<TE>   In the real world, young people behave better than any generation
in decades. Young assailants are not "ordinary" teens any more than
serial killer David Berkowitz is an "ordinary Jew" or child-murderer
Andrea Yates typifies newly murderous womanhood. Journalists and
commentators who claim we're imperiled by a teen apocalypse rely on
isolated cases, a selective morality, historical amnesia and sheer
illogic to spin their tale of an entire generation gone bad. If such
a tactic were used against any other group, it would be branded hate
speech. "Why are so many children plotting to blow up their worlds
and themselves?" demands Powers.</TE>
<TE>   If even one in 100,000 teens plotted mass murder, Powers wouldn't
have to string together rare teen-caused brutalities that occurred
years apart to make his case. Instead, he would have dozens every
month from which to choose.</TE>
<TE>   Powers' fear of today's Vermont teens is puzzling. FBI reports
show teenage homicide in New England over the last 25 years has
dropped from an average of six arrests a year in the 1970s to two in
2000. Rural teen murder is down sharply in recent decades, as are
adolescent deaths from drugs and violence. In Vermont, 33 youths were
arrested for violent crimes in 2000. Not exactly doomsday.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Parks' claims, L.A. law-enforcement records show youth
rape, murder and felony arrest rates today are well below their 1960s
levels, when juveniles committed a far higher proportion of serious
crime. Five times more "ordinary" ("white") youths were arrested for
murder every year in the 1970s than in 1999 or 2000. The FBI's 2000
Uniform Crime Reports estimate youths commit just 5% of the nation's
homicides, the lowest proportion on record.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, any anecdote can be seized upon to construct a story
of suburban teen apocalypse. A few months before L.A. and the
national media jumped on the Rialto teen's beating of an elderly
woman to stir up anti-youth frenzy, an elderly Orange County man beat
a 14-year-old to death and tossed his body in a ditch. The media
didn't overreact by proclaiming a new breed of old-aged monsters,
even though such an image could have been justified by state
statistics showing violent crime among Californians over age 50
tripled in two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Nor did media pundits see apocalypse when, in the month Powers'
Atlantic article appeared, middle-age men gunned down 12 people in
shooting sprees in New Jersey, Illinois and Indiana, mowed down a
dozen in a multi-state hit-and-run rampage and shot six (including
four kids) to death in an affluent Oregon town. Powers, Sullivan and
others seem curiously indifferent to this disarray in their own
generation. Several of the Vermont teens whose violence Powers
sensationalizes are in foster care, where youths are typically placed
after being severely abused or neglected. But Powers nowhere mentions

abused by parents and caretakers every year.</TE>
<TE>   Powers' book "Tom and Huck Don't Live Here Anymore: Childhood and
Murder in the Heart of America," depicts recent teen murders in his
hometown of Hannibal as an assault on Mark Twain's small-town
innocence. Yet, Twain's Huckleberry Finn recounts gun-toting
antebellum 14-year-olds who, like adults, senselessly killed. Though
the 1930s teens who murdered families in doped-crazed rages and 1950s
joykillers who immolated park-goers have faded from memory, how could
anyone forget Charles Manson's 1960s "creepy-crawly" slashers, the
most ordinary of teens in Powers' lexicon?</TE>
<TE>   Today's ephebiphobia is the latest installment of a history of
bogus moral panics targeting unpopular subgroups to obscure an
unsettling reality: Our worst social crisis is middle-Americans own
misdirected fear.</TE>

<BD>Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Affairs and the author
of "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed
the World."</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"We're tough, we're determined, we're relentless," President Bush
told students at the Virginia Military Institute last week. He needs
to be.</LD>
<LD>   Battered by a series of blows in both the Old World and the New,
the Bush administration's struggling foreign policy is headed for a
trial by fire. U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's journey to
the Middle East failed to bring an end to the fighting between
Israelis and Palestinians. Word came from intelligence sources that
Osama bin Laden slipped through America's fingers because U.S. ground
troops were not used in the Tora Bora offensive. The shambolic coup
attempt against Venezuela's pro-Castro, pro-Iraq president, Hugo
Chavez, exposed incompetence and vacillation in the U.S. government.
And, despite administration pandering to steel protectionists,
Congress has not given the president the trade-promotion authority he
needs to move forward with new rounds of talks at the World Trade
Organization and with hemispheric allies to establish the Free Trade
Area of the Americas. Meanwhile, the administration has yet to win
support from key allies for the core element in its current strategy
in the war on terror: forcing a change of regime in Iraq even if this
requires a major military invasion by U.S. forces.</LD>
<TE>   The confusion overseas is beginning to affect opinion polls. While
support for Bush and for the war on terror remains strong, a large
and growing percentage of Americans now doubt whether the
administration has a coherent and viable strategy for prosecuting the
war. With even Bush-friendly news outlets like The Wall Street
Journal criticizing Bush's foreign-policy performance, administration
critics are sharpening their knives.</TE>
<TE>   But both worried friends and eager critics should hold back a
little. The administration's foreign policy is not (yet) melting
down; it's going through the kind of agonizing reappraisal and
adjustment that most administrations face sooner or later.</TE>
<TE>   New administrations often come into Washington with strongly held
opinions about U.S. foreign policy--and then slowly and painfully
modify those views as they run up against the realities and
imperfections of the outside world. Bill Clinton entered office
vowing to put human rights ahead of trade in U.S. relations with
China. He ended by supporting Beijing's admission to the WTO.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration came to office determined to reverse what
it regarded as the Clinton administration's excessive and
irresponsible Wilsonianism. The Clintonistas, said the Bushies,
thought too much about "soft power" and U.S. popularity in the world.
Eager, sometimes almost desperate, to win friends and influence
people abroad, the Clinton administration signed up for international
treaties that conservatives felt were not always in the best
interests of the U.S.: the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, the treaty establishing an international criminal
court and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Forget all that Wilsonian claptrap, said the Bush team. Power
doesn't come because people like you, neo-conservatives argued. It
comes when you take a strong position and stick with it. The United
States should give up trying to serve the interests of the world
community, said the Bush hawks, and concentrate instead on serving
its own national interests in its own way.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, the Bush administration is waking up to learn that soft
power counts. When U.S. foreign policy is popular in other countries,
it is easier for governments to give us support. When--as now--that
policy is deeply unpopular, governments are less willing and less
able to help.</TE>
<TE>   Events are forcing the Bush administration back toward the
center--and, often, back toward policies resembling those of the
Clinton administration. In the wake of the Venezuelan coup, an
embarrassed administration scrambled to restate U.S. support for
constitutional democracy throughout the region--even when it keeps
people like Chavez in power. There is no clear exit strategy for U.S.
troops in Afghanistan. Bush's VMI speech placed a new emphasis on
nation- building and humanitarian work in that unhappy land. Having
done its best to stay out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since
January 2001, the administration finds itself in the same old
diplomatic quagmire Clinton waded through--micromanaging a peace
process in part to satisfy U.S. allies that we are capable of acting
as an honest broker in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the original Bush position was all wrong. Strength
counts. But it doesn't count for everything. The Bush administration
has been consistent and determined in its moves to get rid of Saddam
Hussein--but the allies aren't following. Some, notably the
Europeans, may fall in line down the road, but most of our Middle
East allies are likely to hang back or even oppose us.</TE>
<TE>   Why? It is not because the Egyptian and Saudi regimes sympathize
with Hussein. They hate him and they fear him. But these governments
are weak--too weak to defy an aroused public opinion. They might like
to follow America's lead against Iraq, but they can't. The U.S.
agenda is too unpopular in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   There is more to come, especially with respect to Iraq. It isn't
enough for Bush to repeat his assertion that Hussein is part of an
"axis of evil." The world has heard that message before, and has not
been impressed. A new confrontation with Iraq will only make sense to
U.S. allies if it is presented, at least in part, as a campaign for
multilateralism and for arms control. Hussein is flagrantly defying
both the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the United Nations arms
inspection and control provisions of the cease-fire agreement he
signed to end the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush needs to explain to the world that if Hussein gets
away with this, the entire multilateral system of arms control
becomes a useless set of unenforceable paper agreements. If bad guys
can break vital treaties with no consequences, there is no point in
writing treaties in the first place. This is the kind of message
Europe and Japan like to hear. It tells the world why Hussein is
dangerous; it reminds world opinion that the United States keeps its
word and abides by the treaties we make; it reassures the world that
the U.S. government intends to behave as a responsible international
citizen--and that the world's only superpower is not going rogue.</TE>
<TE>   For some in the administration, there is a downside to making the
campaign against Hussein a campaign for multilateral nonproliferation
and arms-control agreements. It feels like a retreat to touchy-feely
Wilsonianism. The reality, however, is that without an
internationally credible Wilsonian dimension to the U.S. campaign
against Iraq, international support simply won't be forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, being tough, determined and relentless means eating
your own words. Ronald Reagan did it when he returned to Jimmy
Carter's once despised human-rights policies. Carter did it when he
abandoned his policy of accommodation with the Soviets to resist
their invasion of Afghanistan. To fight the total war on terror that
has become his No.1 goal, Bush must rebuild U.S. soft power. The
result almost certainly will be a foreign policy that has more in
common with the Clinton era than Bush or his closest advisors ever
wanted or expected, but nobody ever said foreign policy was easy.</TE>

<HD>Medallion Adds a Classical Touch to a Ceiling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Artisans have been affixing plaster decorations to walls and ceilings
for centuries--mostly in imitation of Greek and Roman bas-relief. In
modern times, the practice peaked in the early 19th century when
Greek Revival architecture reawakened an interest in classical
ornamentation.</LD>
<LD>   Plaster moldings are again popular today--either to give
authenticity to a restoration or to add interest to a flat wall or
ceiling. The designs range from chaste Greek-key borders to Baroque
ceiling medallions.</LD>
<LD>   Although plaster ornamentation is still used, wood and plastic
alternatives can be readily found at lumberyards, home centers and
hardware stores. We prefer the plastic kind because it is lightweight
and easy to work with. The pieces are constructed of a foam or
urethane core with a vinyl-like finish that takes paint beautifully.</LD>
<TE>   For dressing up a ceiling, decorative medallions are reasonably
priced, easy to install and attractive. Ceiling medallions come in
various shapes and sizes. They can be round, square, oval,
rectangular or triangular. You can have a hexagon, an octagon or even
a star. And although a decorative ceiling medallion is often used as
a "rosette" or foil for a chandelier, it is equally popular as a
focal point of a room's ceiling. In either case, it is easy to
install one.</TE>
<TE>   When installing a ceiling medallion where a light fixture exists,
the fixture must be removed and reinstalled after the medallion
installation is completed. Begin by turning off the power to the
light fixture at the breaker panel or fuse box. Don't rely on the
light switch; the power for the light might originate at the fixture
rather than the switch.</TE>
<TE>   With the power off, carefully remove the light fixture--usually
held in place with a couple of screws or a nut on a short length of
threaded tubing. Lower the fixture canopy and carefully disconnect
the wires. Use the opportunity while the fixture is down to give it a
good cleaning and polishing.</TE>
<TE>   Place the ceiling medallion upside-down and cut a hole in the
center, using a drill or fine-tooth saw. The hole should be large
enough to allow wiring and one or more threaded bolts to pass
through, yet small enough to be completely covered by the fixture
canopy.</TE>
<TE>   Next, apply a minimum of a 1/2-inch bead of adhesive along the
outside edge on the underside of the ceiling medallion. Place the
medallion into position on the ceiling immediately after applying
adhesive. Use four 15/8-inch paneling nails equally spaced on the
medallion to hold it in place while the adhesive sets up. Later,
countersink the nails using a nail punch, and conceal the nail heads
with spackling.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of paneling nails, the medallion can be fastened to the
ceiling using construction screws. As you would with paneling nails,
countersink the construction screws and conceal with a patching
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Apply a bead of caulk at the perimeter of the medallion and
smooth, using your finger or a damp sponge. Once the caulk has dried,
the medallion is ready for paint.</TE>
<TE>   For best results, prime the medallion with an oil-base primer and
finish with one or more coats of latex in the color of your choice.</TE>
<TE>   Complete the job by reinstalling the light fixture. Reverse the
steps used to remove it. Due to the added ceiling thickness, longer
screws and/or threaded tubing might be needed to properly anchor the
light fixture.</TE>
<TE>   Reconnect the wires using approved wire connectors, reinstall the
canopy and turn on the power.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks like an Old World Tuscan villa, but this innovative
Brentwood Park house was built recently with the health-conscious in
mind.</LD>
<LD>   The house is purported to be free of formaldehyde, fiberglass,
fumes, pollutant particulates, mold and other toxins.</LD>
<LD>   All wood in the house is said to be free of bacteria that could
grow inside walls. Wood flooring is finished with natural oils. Terra
cotta floors are glazed to eliminate a need for synthetic sealers.</LD>
<TE>   The separate, multi-zone mechanical systems have their own air
filters. The electrical system is designed to minimize the presence
of electromagnetic fields. Potable water is filtered for bathing and
laundering as well as for drinking.</TE>
<TE>   Toxic chemicals were avoided in finish and cabinetry materials.
Natural surfaces were used in all walls, ceilings, floors, cabinets
and countertops.</TE>
<TE>   A raised foundation was designed to allow airflow beneath the
house, preventing mold. A thick layer of plastic sheeting lies
beneath the house to act as a barrier against termites. Even the
landscaping used no chemicals or pesticides and was positioned to
prevent moisture from hitting the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Richard Berliner, the house was built according to
guidelines formulated by Joe Lstiburek of Building Science Corp. and
Mary Cordaro of H3Environmental, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   About the home: It was built in 1998 but is still ahead of its
time in terms of environmental technology, so why is it on the
market? The owners bought a Pacific Palisades home with more land and
an ocean view. They plan to refurbish, using the same guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $6.95 million.</TE>
<TE>   Size: About 9,000 square feet on slightly more than half an acre.
The home has a 1,500-square-foot master bedroom suite with dual
closets, a mini-kitchen, a loft and an enclosed loggia. There are
three family bedrooms, each with a full bathroom; a maid's quarters
with an entrance off the backyard, and a guest suite with a full
kitchen over a three-car, attached garage.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The estate has a two-story entry; a media room; a large
office with its own bathroom; a mirrored gym; an outdoor patio with a
fireplace; a professional sports court with lighting; a dog run; a
large pool and a spa, which are covered and gated; and a fountain and
a pond visible from the living room. A second-floor playroom off the
family bedrooms overlooks the kitchen and the family room. The home,
which is fully walled and gated, is also surrounded by towering,
old-growth trees, which provide shelter and privacy.</TE>

<HD>Multiple Offers and Bidding Wars Abound</HD>
<DH>Sales* Low interest rates and stock market wariness mean
homes are snapped up as soon as they're listed. But that's not
scaring off those willing to pay more than the asking price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Debora Brown-Parker put her three-bedroom Long Beach home on the
market recently, she expected it to sell fairly quickly. The tidy,
1,200-square-foot house was perfect for a first-time buyer, her agent
told her, and because it was fairly priced in a tight market, it was
bound to attract interest.</LD>
<LD>   What she didn't expect was a request to see the house 20 minutes
after it was listed. The eager buyer showed up that evening with her
family and made an offer almost immediately. Six competing offers
quickly followed, overwhelming the first-time seller, who hadn't
counted on such a flurry of activity.</LD>
<LD>   "I had no idea the market was this crazy," said Brown-Parker, a
44-year-old flight attendant, who asked her agent to take the house
off the market until she could decide which offer, if any, to accept.
"We were offered $4,000 over our asking price, but we just couldn't
handle all that bidding."</LD>
<TE>   Real estate experts say the frenzy closely resembles the market of
the late 1990s and 2000, when demand for a limited inventory fueled
bidding wars and home prices soared.</TE>
<TE>   Agents from Ventura to Riverside report that homes in all price
ranges are being snatched up nearly as soon as they're listed. The
perceived threat of rising interest rates and a trend toward
acquiring solid assets, rather than depending on the stock market,
has buyers turning to the real estate market, a traditionally
conservative investment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hot, hot, hot!" said Barbara Shoag, an agent at Re/Max
College Park Realty in Long Beach. "Low interest rates have been very
appealing to first-timers, especially, but also to every other buyer
out there."</TE>
<TE>   Brown-Parker and her husband, Erwin Parker, are trying to sell not
one but two homes. They are in escrow on the sale of a Rancho
Cucamonga home, which Parker bought before the couple married 10
years ago. It sold in six weeks, after attracting three offers.</TE>
<TE>   Brown-Parker, who ended up declining the earlier offers, said they
now will re-list the Long Beach home for $10,000 more than the
original $180,000 asking price. And they probably will get it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this strong market has surprised everyone," said Shirley
Tenger, an agent at Prudential California Realty in Glendale. "Anyone
who was thinking about buying has been buying, even as prices
continue to go up."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the median price of existing homes surged
15.1% to $259,000 in March, up from $225,000 a year ago, according to
figures supplied by DataQuick Information Systems of La Jolla. In
Orange County, the median price rose 11.6% to $357,000.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of available houses, especially in the entry-level
market, has pushed many first-time buyers into condominiums, which
recently have seen a surge of activity. In March, Los Angeles County
condominium sales rose 15%, Orange County, 10.7% and San Bernardino
saw a 12% increase over a year ago, according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   Sales volume on Los Angeles' Westside is higher than it was at the
2000 peak, said Randy Freeman, a Prudential John Aaroe agent in
Pacific Palisades. "Nearly every entry-level listing on the Westside
is seeing a huge number of multiple offers."</TE>
<TE>   That is good news for those selling their homes, but first-time
buyers all over the Southland are feeling the squeeze, agents said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the affordability index, which measures the
percentage of households able to afford the median home price, fell
to 33% in February, from 38% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County posted the lowest affordability in Southern
California at 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime renters Christi and Tim O'Leary of Pomona consider
themselves lucky after bidding on a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home
with a pool in Pomona, for which they paid $231,100--$4,000 more than
the list price.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,700-square-foot fixer was perfect for the couple and their
three children, Christi O'Leary said, but seemed a near-impossible
dream when they made their offer.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted that house, so we bid higher, just assuming
someone else would outbid us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The market time out here is normally about 15 days for properties
under $400,000," said Barbara McClelland, the O'Learys' Century 21
Citrus Valley Realty agent. "But I just sold three properties in less
than four days at or above the list price."</TE>
<TE>   One of the forces driving the current housing boom is the
perception that there still is steam in the economy, despite the
gloomy forecast painted last year during the market cool-off, said
Nima Nattagh, an analyst with FNC Inc., a consultant to the mortgage
industry. "The overall positive economic climate now is going to
override any negative impact as a result of interest rates going up,"
Nattagh said. "The overall picture for the housing market is very
good."</TE>
<TE>   The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage with
one point in March was virtually unchanged, at 6.84%, from a year
ago, according to National Financial News Services, which tracks such
data. Average rates last week hovered around 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Looming higher interest rates and an already saturated market have
resulted in a slight decline in mortgage refinancings nationwide,
said Doug Duncan, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America.</TE>
<TE>   With rates expected to rise to between 7.5% and 8% by early next
year, the volume of refinancings is expected to diminish further,
Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, though, that 7.5% is still a very good rate," Duncan
said. "Housing will continue its role of supporting the recovery."</TE>
<TE>   While overall applications are down compared with last year,
average daily loan applications in March grew 16% over last year at
Countrywide Home Loans.</TE>
<TE>   Home purchase loans grew 56% to $6.7 billion in March over last
year, while refinancings rose 56% to $8.5 billion, according to the
lending giant headquartered in Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate experts say that the threat of climbing interest rates
has only pushed reluctant home buyers into the market, however, not
discouraged them.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have been sitting on the fence are now jumping in,"
said Scott Reed, an agent at Strada Properties in Newport Beach. "And
they should. Product that was $450,000 two years ago is now in the
high $600,000s. The demand is just too great."</TE>

<LD>Actress-director Diane Keaton has purchased a two-story Bel-Air home
in the $6-million range. The asking price was $7.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1928, the refurbished classic Spanish-style home has six
bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in slightly more than 7,000 square feet.</LD>
<LD>   The home, on nearly an acre with a hacienda-style courtyard, also
has a large living room, a den-office, a screening room and a
breakfast room. Most rooms open to a pool, spa, cabana and patios.</LD>
<TE>   Designed by George Washington Smith, the house was described as
being "typical Diane Keaton style." Keaton loves Spanish-style houses
built in the '20s and is known for restoring them in fine taste.</TE>
<TE>   She has refurbished a number of L.A.-area homes, including one in
Beverly Hills that she sold a couple of years ago to Madonna for $6.5
million. That house, Spanish in style, wasn't listed when Madonna
bought it.</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Keaton bought a Laguna Beach house that was not on
the market, either. The house, built in 1924, was purchased for about
$1.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Keaton, who won a best actress Oscar for "Annie Hall" (1977),
co-starred in the movies "Town &amp; Country" (2001) and "Hanging Up"
(2000), which she also directed. She has published several
collections of her photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Keaton, 56, most recently co-starred with Jennifer Jason Leigh in
the TV movie "Crossed Over," which aired on CBS in March. Keaton also
was co-executive producer of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Aileen Comora of Sotheby's, Beverly Hills, represented Keaton in
her purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Amy Smart, who co-starred in the movie "Rat Race" (2001),
has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home for close to its asking price
of $699,000.</TE>
<TE>   Smart, 26, bought a country English-style home, behind gates, with
two bedrooms in 2,000 square feet. Built in the '40s, the split-level
house also has a pool, gardens and sun room with walls of glass.</TE>
<TE>   Smart, who co-starred as James Van Der Beek's girlfriend in the
movie "Varsity Blues" (1999), had a recurring role on the WB's
"Felicity," playing the love interest of Felicity's former boyfriend,
Noel.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Smart had a featured role in the movie "Road Trip" and
co-starred in the NBC miniseries "The '70s."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills,
represented the actress in buying; Yaffa and Michael Lerner of Lerner
Realty Inc. had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing designer Mossimo Giannulli has purchased a Bel-Air home
for close to its asking price of $7.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the early 1940s, the house, on nearly 1.5 acres, has four
bedrooms in just under 5,000 square feet. The two-story
colonial-style home also has a pool.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Giannulli, 38, sold a 1-acre, Bel-Air site to actor
Nicolas Cage. Giannulli had taken the site as partial payment in
March 2001 for a Bel-Air home he sold to developer David Murdock,
chief executive of Castle &amp; Cook, for $11.5 million, sources said at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Cooper, a former president of Virgin Records in Los Angeles,
and his wife, Philippa, have put their Brentwood home on the market
at just under $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who had owned the home for two years, plan to move
back to London. Before moving to L.A. in 1997, Cooper had been a
joint managing director of Virgin's record label in Britain,
nurturing such acts as the Spice Girls.</TE>
<TE>   Another Brentwood-area home that the Coopers owned is in escrow.
It was listed at about $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The house they just listed has three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.
The two-story house, with high ceilings and three fireplaces, is on
more than an acre with a grassy yard and terraced gardens. Built in
1969, the house also has city views.</TE>
<TE>   Leah Steuer of Prudential John Aaroe, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Producer-director Will Zens, who has directed such movies as the
Vietnam War film "To the Shores of Hell" (1966)--featuring Richard
Arlen as a Marine general--has listed his Westlake Village home at
$800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Zens and his wife, Janis, have entertained many actors and other
entertainers in the ranch-style home, which the couple has owned
since it was built 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The producer-director designed the house and supervised its
construction. When the house was completed, the couple and seven of
their nine children lived there.</TE>
<TE>   The five-bedroom, 2,800-square-foot home, which has an office and
a den, is on an acre with city and mountain views. There are sweeping
views from two front porches. Two rear patios are used for
entertaining. A long driveway leads to the house. There is parking
for more than 10 cars.</TE>
<TE>   Country music stars such as Buck Owens, Tammy Wynette, Johnny Cash
and Merle Haggard were featured in three of his films.</TE>
<TE>   Among other movies that Zens directed were "Hot Summer in Barefoot
County" (1974), "Truckin' Man" (1975) and "The Fix" (1983).</TE>
<TE>   Emmett Dalton of Dalton Realty in Thousand Oaks has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   A Brentwood home owned for several years by Judy Garland has been
sold by the family that purchased it from the actress in 1968. The
most recent asking price was $4.85 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Torielio family, which just sold the house, entertained such
notables as Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Taylor and Edmund O'Brien in
the five-bedroom, nearly 6,300-square-foot home, built in 1952. The
Torielios turned the house into a French Regency-style villa.</TE>
<TE>   The Torielios are related to Walter Guzzardi, an L.A. businessman
who bought the El Rancho Vegas Hotel in Las Vegas in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Levin and Gardy Weickert of Prudential California Realty,
Brentwood, handled the deal.</TE>

<LD>"Be on Guard Against Phony Contractors," by Lew Sichelman [April 14],
makes excellent suggestions on how to avoid getting ripped off by
unscrupulous contractors. He notes in the last paragraph, though,
that one should pay no more than a third of the job cost in advance.
California consumers should be aware that state law prohibits
contractors from accepting in advance more than 10% or $1,000,
whichever is less.</LD>

<DH>With plans to become a foster parent, a renter on a tight
budget searches for a two-bedroom home. She overcomes the first
hurdle: Qualifying for a loan despite a bankruptcy in her past.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Paul would be perfectly content living another 10 years in
her one-bedroom, 850-square-foot rental near Beverlywood in Los
Angeles. But the 39-year-old teacher--a self-described pack rat--is
running out of space, but not because of her four cats or the piles
of books overflowing her living room bookshelves and window sills.
She's planning to become a foster parent.</LD>
<LD>   "You need to have a two-bedroom place if you're going to have a
kid," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Yet homeownership seems unattainable to Paul, who grosses about
$45,000 a year teaching English and English as a Second Language at
Palms Middle School in Los Angeles. Not only is her income limited,
but Paul has only $5,000 in savings, and she once filed for
bankruptcy--the only blemish on her otherwise perfect credit history.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole thing seems very bleak," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But having been accepted as a foster parent has motivated Paul to
try to get into the housing market, especially now that interest
rates have made it less of a stretch to move from paying rent to a
mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a larger apartment last fall," she said, "and
$1,200 was the cheapest I could find."</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that even with Paul's bankruptcy, Elva Pacific,
an operations manager with Provident Bank Mortgage in Riverside, was
able to qualify Paul for a loan for the purchase of a $180,000 home.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul has made a good faith effort" in reestablishing herself
after the bankruptcy, Pacific said. Bankruptcy can be overcome if the
borrower is given an opportunity to explain the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I put a lot of things into this decision," Pacific said. "You may
be declined [for a loan] quickly because of a bankruptcy if a
computer is doing the work. But when a human being is involved, that
can be a different story....</TE>
<TE>   "You might have to roll up your sleeves a little bit," she said,
"but if you are determined, you'll get the loan."</TE>
<TE>   The rules regarding bankruptcy vary depending on the type of loan,
Pacific said. For FHA or VA loans, lenders look for a two-year period
of good credit following a bankruptcy. For conventional loans,
lenders demand four years of solid credit and proof that credit has
been reestablished.</TE>
<TE>   In Paul's case, she had signed for the purchase of an SUV for a
friend. But when her friend reneged on the $450-a-month payment, Paul
took over, even though she was living on student loans while getting
her teaching credential and master's degree in education at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   She ended up accumulating $20,000 in debt on credit cards, some
with interest rates of 25%. She declared bankruptcy in 2000, on the
advice of a bankruptcy lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, the bankruptcy was discharged, meaning Paul was
relieved of her debts. She opted, however, to repay the $35,000 she
owed in student loans--$210 a month in payments she's kept current.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't back out of those student loans," Pacific said. "That
was good."</TE>
<TE>   A letter of explanation to the FHA, explaining these
circumstances, would be sufficient to clear the bankruptcy for loan
approval, Pacific said. "I consider [her bankruptcy] a one-time
thing.... There are chronic abusers of credit and then there are
isolated issues like this one."</TE>
<TE>   With the bankruptcy issue solved, Pacific recommended a 30-year
FHA loan with a 6.5% interest rate for Paul in the amount of
$174,600. That type of loan would give Paul a monthly housing payment
of $1,430--substantially more than the $650 a month she's been paying
for rent.</TE>
<TE>   But as Paul suspected, her mortgage wouldn't be much more than the
rent for many two-bedroom units on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   The loan would require 3% down, or about $5,400, and an estimated
additional $6,000 in closing costs--about $11,000 that Paul does not
have. To bridge that gap, Pacific recommended that Paul apply for a
special program administered by the Los Angeles County Community
Development Commission called the Mortgage Revenue Bond program.</TE>
<TE>   The program provides a 3.5% gift for first-time home buyers
purchasing property in Los Angeles (outside Los Angeles city limits)
and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   The money does not have to be repaid and can go toward making a
down payment on a home or for closing costs. All that is asked of
recipients is that they attend an educational workshop. Currently,
the maximum income limit for the program for one- to two-person
households is $65,400; for families of three or more, the maximum
income limit is $76,300, according to Los Angeles County program
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles also offers a similar program for
first-time home buyers purchasing property within city limits,
according to Doug Smith, manager of the homeownership unit of the
city's Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, both agencies offer teacher-assistance programs
where credentialed educators teaching in low-performing schools are
given $7,500 toward the purchase of a home. Paul was not eligible for
that program because Palms Middle School is not considered a
low-performing school.</TE>
<TE>   "[These programs have] really made the difference for first-time
home buyers," said Jewel Warren-Reed, with the Community Development
Commission. "Some people can make a housing payment, but they just
can't come up with the down."</TE>
<TE>   In Paul's case, the program would give her about $6,000 for the
down payment on a house. She would then need to come up with the
rest--about $5,000 in closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Although Paul could deplete her savings, Pacific recommended she
instead negotiate with the seller to pay for some or all of her
closing costs. Doing so, Pacific explained, would free up Paul's
savings for clothing and furniture for her foster child.</TE>
<TE>   Having a seller pay a buyer's closing costs, is "a typical
practice in this price range," Pacific said. Most sellers, she said,
expect this and price homes accordingly. But Paul became immediately
discouraged with how little inventory there is in the $180,000 price
range.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Michael Layana, a real estate broker with Cavanaugh
Realtors in Culver City, was able to find only four properties--all
two-bedroom condos--in Paul's price range in the neighborhoods of
West Los Angeles, Mar Vista, Venice, Palms and Culver City--all short
commutes to Paul's work.</TE>
<TE>   Layana indicated that the summer months might bring more choices
for Paul. "You never know," he said. "There could be a bunch of new
homes that go on the market tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   But if Paul waited, that would have severely pushed back her
foster-care plans. So she decided to look at two of the
properties--both located in woodsy, tree-lined large complexes in
Culver City--but quickly decided that neither felt like home.</TE>
<TE>   Both condos were small--one was 852 square feet, the other was
972--and the units were listed at $165,000 and $179,000,
respectively. Instead of the open, grassy feeling she had envisioned
for her new family life, the properties were dormitory-like with
multiple buildings, winding pathways and long, dark hallways.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want to live in a big complex," she said. She was
also put off by the homeowners association fees of $189 and $289 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Paul has opened her search to the communities of
Lennox and Inglewood--about 10 miles south of her workplace, but
where single-family homes are within her price range, and
neighborhoods have grassy yards, tree-lined streets and a
child-friendly atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be great for my foster kid to have a yard," she said of
one two-bedroom property she found in Inglewood and hoped to bid on.
"I would just need a fence to enclose it and that would be a great
place for a kid."</TE>

<TE>   This Month's Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Home buyer: Elizabeth Paul, 39</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Seventh-grade schoolteacher</TE>
<TE>   Gross annual income: About $45,000</TE>
<TE>   Goal: Purchase a two-bedroom home so she can have enough space to
become a foster parent.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Paul had a bankruptcy less than two years ago, has
little savings for a down payment and wants to live on the Westside
near her employment.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Talk openly about bankruptcy, asking for a face-to-face meeting
with a loan officer to explain circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   * To reestablish credit without taking on another credit card,
work diligently to build consistency by paying car insurance premiums
on time and by keeping a balanced checking account.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask lender to shop for any and all first-time home buyer
programs offering financial gifts.</TE>
<TE>   * Negotiate--especially in low-priced starter homes--that the
seller pay all or some of the closing costs. Sellers are expecting
this and have priced their homes accordingly.</TE>

<HD>As Kitchen and Bath Decor Gets Hipper, the Prices Get
Headier</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Trendy kitchens are wearing color or a metallic sheen this year, and
hip bathrooms have whirlpools.</LD>
<LD>   But flashy bathrooms and kitchens with pizazz don't come cheap,
and companies at the recent Kitchen/Bath Industry Show &amp; Conference
in Chicago hope their new products and designs will persuade
customers to shell out that extra cash.</LD>
<LD>   Though appliance makers saw consumers cut back on spending for
their homes last year, they are planning for a better 2002 as people
clamor for high-priced decor, even when it calls for pinching pennies
elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "People want to put their own personality on their homes," said
Dennis Ayers, owner of Ayers &amp; Associates, which does mainly kitchen
cabinet design. "When they have a price limit, people will give up
the accessories inside for the appearance."</TE>
<TE>   At the annual show, bath designers perused wares that included
fancy tubs with whirlpools, air jets, waterfalls and even an embedded
flat-screen television. Kitchen designers checked out the latest
high-tech appliances and current crazes like stainless-steel finish.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest U.S. home appliance makers, among them Whirlpool
Corp., Maytag Corp. and General Electric Co.'s GE Appliances, were at
the show, as well as smaller companies offering everything from
purple toilets to Turkish and Italian tiles. Maytag is focusing on
the upper end of the market to drive growth in its business, said
chief executive Ralph Hake.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe as a company that people will pay for innovation," he
said. "It's our job to convince them to pay for that."</TE>
<TE>   To tap into the high end, Maytag has introduced new products
including a dishwasher with three racks and a refrigerator that lets
customers design the front to their own specifications.</TE>
<TE>   The stainless-steel kitchen appliance trend seems to be as strong
as ever. Once the province of premium-priced European brands and
makers of professional kitchen products, the pieces are now available
in scaled-down versions.</TE>
<TE>   AB Electrolux has two stainless-steel kitchen lines in the United
States, sold under its Frigidaire brand. The lines look similar to
professional and European appliance lines but offer fewer features
and a lower price.</TE>
<TE>   "These are definitely upscale products, but not all the way up in
the stratosphere," said Tony Evans, an Electrolux spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   To further capitalize on the metallic craze, Electrolux exhibited
prototypes of refrigerators with patterned brass, copper and silver
finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Whirlpool chief executive David Whitwam has said new products will
jump-start what has been an industry stalemate that drove appliance
makers to focus on prices to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Whirlpool, the biggest U.S. appliance maker, is rolling out new
laundry products including its Personal Valet, which can steam clean
dry-clean-only clothes. It is also rolling out a new line of
whirlpool tubs under the name Cielo.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are trying to create a new paradigm for home design.
"The good life now is home and family," said Gary Uhl, director of
design for American Standard's U.S. plumbing products.</TE>
<TE>   American Standard's booth at the show featured home decor goodies
such as child-size toilets and sinks, and cabinets with faded paint
jobs that look like they might have belonged to your grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "People now feel entitled and empowered to invest in themselves,"
Uhl said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If your concrete driveway, carport or garage floor looks like an Indy
500 pit stop, we have a cleaning recipe for you.</LD>
<LD>   First, soak up the grease with cat litter. Cover the area with a
generous amount and grind it in with the soles of your shoes. Sweep
it up and dispose of the soiled material.</LD>
<LD>   Next, saturate the area with a cola beverage, working it into the
concrete with a stiff bristle broom but not allowing it to dry. Once
the cola has stopped fizzing, flush the area with clean fresh water.</LD>
<TE>   Whiten the gray stain that remains with a solution of 1 cup of
powdered laundry detergent and 1 cup of liquid chlorine bleach in 1
gallon of very hot water. Finish the job with a final rinse.</TE>

<HD>Two Hotels Polish Up the Midtown Manhattan Scene</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle; Times staff and wires</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York's post-Sept. 11 recovery is getting a glitzy boost from the
opening of two upscale hotels in midtown Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   On April 29, three months after New York's first Ritz-Carlton
opened, a second will make its debut on Central Park. The 33-story
hotel, at 50 Central Park South, is the former St. Moritz, designed
by Emery Roth in the 1930s. It was operated briefly by boutique
hotelier Ian Schrager, and now by Millennium Partners, which
downsized it from 700 to 277 rooms that average 450 square feet.
Services include free Bentley limousine service at night in midtown.</LD>
<LD>   The building also houses 11 multimillion-dollar condominiums on
its upper floors, a spa operated by Switzerland's La Prairie (a first
in the U.S., the hotel says) and the Atelier restaurant. The
restaurant, run by Frenchman Gabriel Kreuther, former chef de cuisine
at the city's highly rated Jean Georges, will serve what's described
as "innovative French cuisine with a nod to America's rich regional
roots."</LD>
<TE>   The first Ritz opened in Battery Park, four blocks from the former
World Trade Center site, in January. It has 298 rooms and 113 private
condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   Introductory room rates at the newest Ritz, from its opening
through Sept. 8, start at $425 per night; after Sept. 8, prices will
increase to $650. Top suites go for $12,000 to $13,000. (800)
241-3333, www.ritzcarlton.com.</TE>
<TE>   The 65-room City Club Hotel at 55 W. 44th St., located in a
1904-vintage gentlemen's club that was later used as offices, has
been gradually opening rooms as they are finished; the last of them,
three duplex suites and three penthouses, are expected to open in the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first hotel venture for 31-year-old Jeff Klein, scion of
New York entrepreneurs and a fixture in high society. He says he is
going for a "stylish, not trendy" style, somewhere between what he
calls the "sedate aesthetic" of Ritz-Carlton and the "outlandish"
take of some boutique hotels. The eclectic design, by Jeffrey
Bilhuber, whose clients include entertainers David Bowie and Michael
Douglas, combines traditional with '50s furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel restaurant, DB Bistro Moderne, made a hit with its
gourmet $27 hamburger when it opened last year, reports Zagat Survey.
The chef is Daniel Boulud of New York's Daniel and Cafe Boulud
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel rooms start at about $225 per night; the duplexes will start
at about $795, Klein says. (212) 921-5500, www.cityclubhotel.com.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii Ends Program to Catch Speeders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle; Times staff and wirefxs; Associated
Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HONOLULU--Hawaii Gov. Ben Cayetano has ordered the shutdown of a
traffic-camera program to catch speeders. The program, begun in
January on Oahu roadways used heavily by tourists and locals alike,
was to move to other islands this summer. But it faced harsh
criticism from residents and legal challenges as attorneys found
loopholes.</LD>
<LD>   The governor said he took the action because the Legislature
planned to repeal the three-year pilot program. But he added,
"Driving at faster speeds has become a habit for many drivers and
explains, at least in part, why there was so much opposition to the
traffic van cam."</LD>

<LD>Those fascinated by the ill-fated 1914-16 Antarctic voyage of
explorer Ernest Shackleton, the subject of a TV miniseries broadcast
earlier this month by A&amp;E, can retrace his steps this winter on trips
run by adventure tour operators. You won't have to take a lot of
provisions--just a lot of money.</LD>
<LD>   Toronto-based Fathom Expeditions Inc. has drafted explorer Conrad
Anker to accompany an 18-day "Spirit of Shackleton" trip to
Antarctica, South Georgia Island and the Falkland Islands beginning
Feb. 21. There will be an option to hike part of Shackleton's route
across South Georgia. The price is $8,395 per person, double
occupancy. International air fare is extra. (800) 621-0176,
www.fathomexpeditions.com.</LD>
<LD>   Connecticut-based Quark Expeditions offers two trips. A 20-day
South Georgia voyage, departing Nov. 1, includes an option to don 20
to 30 pounds of gear (mostly provided by Quark) and spend five days
trekking across the island. Another 20-day voyage in February follows
Shackleton's path from Antarctica to Elephant Island to South Georgia
and ends in the Falklands. Prices for both cruises begin at $7,195
per person; add $3,350 for the five-day South Georgia trek. Air fare
is extra. (800) 356-5699, www.quarkexpeditions.com.</LD>

<LD>Cathay Pacific is reinstating some flights from the West Coast that
it cut after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Among the changes:
Service between Los Angeles and Hong Kong will increase from seven to
10 flights a week starting June 1.... Tour buses, recreational
vehicles and rental trucks earlier this month were allowed to travel
across Hoover Dam for the first time since Sept. 11. Long-haul
tractor-trailers will remain banned indefinitely, said a spokesman
for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in Boulder City. The dam is along
U.S. Highway 93, a main travel route between Las Vegas and
Phoenix.... Travel seller www.expedia.com has added Internet-only
Alaska Airlines discount fares to its site.... Club Med, the
worldwide resort chain, has ended its $30 one-time initiation fee for
guests.... Admission tickets to the San Diego Zoo ($32 adults, $19.75
ages 3-11) and the San Diego Wild Animal Park ($26.50 adults, $19.50
ages 3-11) can now be bought online at www.sandiegozoo.org.</LD>

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>A Seal of Approval for Half Moon Bay</HD>
<DH>Rich in wildlife, Ano Nuevo is the focal point by day, but
by night, dining is the lure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EILEEN HANSEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>HALF MOON BAY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The glossy elephant seal pup reached around its stuffed sausage of a
body and, given its girth, made an improbable move. Scratching its
head with a flipper, it sighed, then gazed lazily at me as if to say,
"What are you doing hiking here when there's so much lolling about to
be done?"</LD>
<LD>   The pup had a point. It was Friday, and relaxation should have
been the mode. But there I was a few weeks ago, standing atop a dune
at Ano Nuevo State Reserve, 55 miles south of San Francisco. A
naturalist and a gaggle of us tourists had hiked a mile or more out
to these fog-laden shores.</LD>
<LD>   Our mission: to see these creatures at their largest mainland
breeding ground in the world. Afterward my husband, Jay, and I
planned to explore the shops and galleries in the town of Half Moon
Bay, about 20 miles north.</LD>
<TE>   Part 1 of our mission had gone well: The beach was covered with
velvety northern elephant seal pups, many shaped like small blimps.
Nearby were their mothers, who had come ashore in December to give
birth, nurse and mate again. Their pups grow from a birth weight of
75 pounds to an average of 300 pounds in less than a month.
Understandably, the moms looked tired.</TE>
<TE>   And the males? Those 21/2-ton, Buick-size masses of blubber with
the bulbous schnozzles? By late March they had left on a 3,000-mile
journey to feed on high-protein fish near Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   We were slightly disappointed to have missed the guys, but as our
knowledgeable guide, Earle Jones, explained, for the male elephant
seal it's veni, vidi, vici. If you want to see their bloody battles
for chief stud rights or the beachside show that marks mating season,
you have to visit the reserve December through March, when
reservations are required. It's a tough ticket; in an effort not to
disturb the animals, the park limits admission, and weekends book up
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In April the beach is reopened for unrestricted access as it
converts from nursery to molting grounds for females and juveniles
and, in summer, for older males. (Free permits, available at the park
entrance station 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily, are required.)
Naturalists remain on the beach to answer questions and make sure
visitors don't get too close to the animals.</TE>
<TE>   With so much going on at the reserve year-round, I asked Jones
when he thought was the best time to visit Ano Nuevo.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time," Jones said. "This place is so rich in history,
wildlife and natural beauty, you'll never be disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   As we found out, the same goes for Half Moon Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Once a sleepy little town of farmers who prize the rich coastal
soil and surfers who covet the legendary waves at a spot called
Mavericks, Half Moon Bay also has become home to great restaurants,
galleries and a swinging jazz bar.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of a Ritz-Carlton last year and the inevitable creep
of Silicon Valley suburbia haven't tinged Half Moon Bay's charm. When
we strolled Main Street, the backward - baseball - cap - versus
-battered-cowboy-hat count was about even. Sure, plenty of clothing
stores in town sell $200 walking shoes and $45 scented candles, but
there's also Half Moon Bay Feed &amp; Fuel, where you can purchase Bag
Balm, baby chicks and all manner of rakes, shovels and brooms.</TE>
<TE>   Though downtown is picture-book cute, we chose to stay at the
Cypress Inn, about five minutes up the coast at Miramar Beach. As
long as we had come all this way, Jay and I wanted to fall asleep to
the sound of the surf.</TE>
<TE>   We needed the rest, and we weren't disappointed. Our room, La
Luna, was small. But at $215 a night plus tax, it was the least
expensive, and the door and windows that opened to a deck overlooking
the beach made it feel more spacious. (Weekend rates at the inn run
$215 to $365 per night.) True to its name, La Luna was painted a
silvery blue and, like the rest of the inn, was decorated with a
Southwestern touch.</TE>
<TE>   After our Ano Nuevo hike on Friday, we relaxed at the inn with
hors d'oeuvres and wine, included in the rate, and the innkeeper gave
us directions to Cafe Gibraltar, our dinner destination.</TE>
<TE>   If a friend hadn't strongly recommended Cafe Gibraltar, we might
have overlooked this treasure in nearby Montara. Run by chef Jose
Luis Ugalde and wife Liam Durkee, the restaurant is unpretentious,
and the food, which tends toward Mediterranean, is spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   While Jay enjoyed grilled petrale sole with a blood-orange sauce,
I had artichoke hearts stuffed with red onions, sage and feta cheese,
baked and served over pearl couscous. Both entrees were delicious, as
were our salads. The food was as beautifully presented as it was
tasty, and we loved the easy atmosphere of the place. Families with
children dined nearby, and at about 9 o'clock, the whole place began
to wind down--a delightful contrast of big-city cuisine with a
small-town setting.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Gibraltar's schedule fit our own. Inveterate early birds, Jay
and I scheduled an 8 a.m. yoga class Saturday at the Sun Center, a
geodesic dome built of hand-hewn wood by Michael Powers, an extreme
kayaker and Nordic spirit whose fantastical compound is a
three-minute walk from the Cypress Inn. Warmed by a wood-burning fire
and the encouragement of our instructor, Klaus Lehrach, we twisted
into some improbable poses, feeling a bit like elephant seals
ourselves after our feast the night before.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't dissuade us from taking a hearty breakfast of peach
yogurt parfait and frittata at our inn before strolling to the Dunn
Mehler Gallery, an airy space with seemingly hundreds of windows
opening to the sea. The contemporary American art included
handcrafted furniture, Eastern-inspired stone sculpture and abstract
three-dimensional works in bronze. Again, the contrast made us smile:
a sophisticated gallery worthy of any major city, right across the
street from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   That night we set out to experience Cetrella, one of the latest
additions to Half Moon Bay's restaurant scene. Cetrella's executive
chef is Erik Cosselmon, formerly of the well-regarded Rose Pistola in
San Francisco, and the menu includes Catalonian shellfish stew,
hearth-braised rabbit and other European dishes. We started by
splitting a chicory salad dressed with balsamic vinegar and shaved
Parmesan. Jay chose an entree special of rotisserie-roasted pork loin
with fingerling potatoes and braised chard. Still feeling elephant
seal-ish, I ordered the Provencal vegetable tian wrapped with roasted
eggplant. Both were delicious. We split dessert--berry tart with a
scoop of Meyer lemon ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxed and replete as we were, we couldn't resist visiting the
bar, where an accomplished jazz trio was in full swing. The audience
was in full swing too, dancing and clapping. As we moved through the
crowd, a woman inadvertently swung her arm into my purse.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'm sorry," she said. "I just get so excited. Can you believe
there's live music like this here in little Half Moon Bay?" I
couldn't have agreed more.</TE>

<HD>Looking for a Great Deal? Perhaps It Can Wait</HD>
<DH>More of us are holding off and booking trips later. Change
fees, the Internet and fear of commitment figure in the trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"All things come round to him who will but wait," poet Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow told us. Or so many of us believe as we delay
booking vacations, hoping to snag a last-minute opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   Customers who used to arrange leisure trips two or three months
before departing now book about a month ahead, says Steve Loucks,
spokesman for Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a Minneapolis-based network of
more than 1,000 travel agency offices. Their plea, he says: "Help me.
Get me a deal."</LD>
<LD>   Internet travel seller Site59, www.site59.com, which specializes
in trips sold two weeks to three hours before departure, has seen its
monthly sales grow from $100,000 in February 2001 to well into seven
figures today. (President Michelle Peluso declines to give an exact
figure, except to say sales are up 4,000% from last year.) A year
ago, 77% of those who bought Site59's last-minute trips booked seven
days out or less; now 87% do, according to data from Site59 and its
more than 200 affiliates.</LD>
<TE>   At Club Med, the worldwide chain that pioneered the all-inclusive
resort, 21% of the customers who splashed, skied and sunbathed in
December booked their trip the same month, compared with 11% the year
before. "It's been a white-knuckle ride," says John Vanderslice,
president and CEO of Club Med for North America. Like other travel
company executives, he is puzzling over why travelers are booking so
late.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question this has become a pronounced trend," says
Peter Yesawich, president of Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown, a
marketing, advertising and public relations firm specializing in
travel and based in Orlando, Fla. His company's surveys show that
between 1998 and 2000, the average number of days ahead that
Americans plan vacations dropped from 30.5 to 25.5 for weekends and
from 53.4 to 37.5 for extended trips. About a fifth of us are booking
our travel just seven to 10 days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons are myriad and not likely to change soon, according to
Yesawich and Peluso. Two-career families find it harder to coordinate
vacations in advance. The events of Sept. 11 coupled with the
uncertain economy have made travelers "commitment-phobic," Peluso
says. Change fees of up to $100 slapped on airline tickets are also
making us reluctant to book before we're sure we can go.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest influence, though, may be the Internet, both experts
say. Savvy travelers learned several years ago that they could get
good deals by booking late. Even more went online beginning last
October, when major media trumpeted last-minute discounts on hotel
rooms and airline seats vacated by skittish post-Sept. 11 travelers.</TE>
<TE>   New technology has also driven the last-minute psychology. For
instance, Site59, launched in May 2000, has software that scans
computerized reservation systems for available hotel rooms, rental
cars and airline seats, then matches them up in packages. Offers can
be updated hourly, Peluso says.</TE>
<TE>   These developments are good news for consumers, Yesawich says,
breeding more and cheaper deals. The effects are evident in hotel
rates. For the week ending April 6, rates were down nearly 5% from
last year even though only about 1% fewer rooms were occupied,
according to Smith Travel Research. In other words, hoteliers were
filling up rooms by discounting them, often at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not a good idea to book all or even most travel late in
the game. Choices as well as prices may dwindle as time passes.</TE>
<TE>   And be sure to take a skeptical look at the merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: a "San Francisco" two-night weekend getaway that I
priced on Site59 on April 10 for travel April 13. The total, less
than $200 per person, double occupancy, for hotel and round-trip air
from LAX, looked great. But the first hotel listed, which was the
only one available without add-ons of $4.77 to $249.40 per night, was
in Foster City, about 20 miles south of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   I chose the centrally located Crowne Plaza Union Square, for
$19.16 more per night, and still saved a bundle. When I called the
Crowne Plaza, its "best available rate" was $175.56 per person total
for the two nights, and American Airlines quoted me $308 for the same
flights, for a total of $483.56 per person versus $184.94 for the
package.</TE>
<TE>   Packages let hotels and airlines hide how much they're
discounting, so there's no way to tell what American or Crowne Plaza
alone was charging for the San Francisco package. That can work to
consumers' advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "High-end hotels are conscious of their images," Peluso says.
"They don't want to say they're selling rooms for $50, but they'll
put it in a package." Because upscale hotels are hurting more, they
may cut more. The industry's "dirty little secret," Peluso says, is
that you may be able to stay at a boutique hotel downtown for less
than a chain hotel near the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Offline travel agents can also help find packages, some of which
are offered exclusively to them. Carlson Wagonlit spokesman Loucks
cites a client in Charleston, S.C., who wanted to vacation in Reno,
Nev., on four days' notice in March. The round-trip air fare alone
was $1,900. An agent found a two-night package, with air, hotel and
car rental, for $677.</TE>
<TE>   Certain types of travel with high fixed costs, such as cruises and
tours, are less well suited to last-minute bookings.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be lulled into a false sense that you can get a great deal
if you book in the last few weeks," Loucks says of cruises. "You may
be sorely disappointed." Cruise lines typically offer discounts of
30% to 50% if you book at least three months out, says Mike Driscoll,
editor of the newsletter Cruise Week. Although you may beat that rate
by booking a week or two before departure, the cruise also may be
sold out, especially in high season, such as summer in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   Tour operators are typically locked into contracts with hotels
that make them use the rooms or lose them, up to 90 days in advance.
"There's a lot of renegotiating going on" to reduce that lead time,
says Kathy LeTarte, president of the National Tour Assn. Meanwhile,
expect to book most tours well in advance too.</TE>
<TE>   As for vacation rentals, David Levine, chairman, president and CEO
of ResortQuest International, which claims to be the largest operator
of private homes and condos in U.S. and Canadian resort areas, says
the average booking window for drive-to beach resorts actually
lengthened late last fall, from 102 to 125 days before arrival, but
it dropped for skiing and Hawaiian destinations. Blame the fear of
flying for that, he says. But overall, he adds, both figures have
been pretty steady for the last three years. The moral: Book your
vacation condo well ahead, especially if you hope for a place by the
beach.</TE>

<DL>LA GRAVE, Canada</DL>
<LD>LA GRAVE, Canada -- Leonard Clark's great-grandfather arrived on the
Magdalen Islands clinging to a lifeboat after the Good Intent, the
ship he traveled on from England, lost its rudder in a gale in
December 1855. His wife's grandfather floated ashore on a ladder
several decades later.</LD>
<LD>   After years of digging through shipping records and mariners'
journals in Europe and North America, Clark, an amateur archeologist,
estimates the Magdalen shoals have scuttled 1,000 sailing vessels.
The reason for the treachery lies in their location: They're halfway
between Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island in the middle of the
entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, making them a foundering ground
for storm-struck 19th century ships carrying wood to England and
immigrants to Canada. Many of the castaways stayed; some of the
houses they built from wood delivered by the waves remain.</LD>
<LD>   Les Iles-de-la-Madeleine, or simply "Les Iles," as they are known,
are a 50-mile-long croissant-shaped archipelago fringed by 160 miles
of wild, wide beaches. They have long been a summer getaway for
residents of Quebec, the Canadian province in which they lie.</LD>
<TE>   When the tourists who triple the population from early June to
early September thin out after Labor Day, departing by plane or
ferry, the Magdalens are reclaimed by a year-round population of
15,000. My boyfriend, Philip, and I arrived after the crowds last
September when the air was still warmed by the waters of the Gulf of
St. Lawrence, which surround the islands.</TE>
<TE>   Exuding an isolated Robinson Crusoe aura, these islands are
magical as only remote, windswept specks of land can be, swirling
with fog and tales of romance and adventure set against a backdrop of
pounding surf. The pace is leisurely and the cast of characters
lively and colorful. The eclectic collection of weathered fishermen
and seal hunters, artists and well-heeled refugees from the rat race
has created an uncommon melange of rural simplicity and European
sophistication that we found alluring.</TE>
<TE>   We flew from Montreal to the Magdalen Islands, a two-hour flight,
renting a car on arrival so we could explore the beaches and
far-flung towns. But often we abandoned our four wheels for two and
cycled along the miles of paved bike routes that line the beaches of
most islands. We split our time evenly between B&amp;Bs on the islands of
Havre-aux-Maisons and Havre Aubert. We spent a week in all, plenty of
time to explore, relax, kayak the coastline, sample the islands'
cuisine and practice our French with locals at outdoor cafes.</TE>
<TE>   About 95% of the residents of the "Maggies" are French Canadian;
the rest are English speaking. Most people in the towns speak some
English; in the countryside English is rarely spoken. The single main
town, Cap-aux-Meules--"Grindstone" to the Anglophones--is an
unremarkable gathering place for modern commerce and administration,
so we did not spend much time there.</TE>
<TE>   Instead we made our first base about 10 minutes' drive away at a
lovely B&amp;B, Au Salange, a large house set on a remote stretch of
meadow overlooking the sea on Havre-aux-Maisons. Local art
complements the breezy, stylish island theme.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller hamlets of the Magdalens are more charming than
Cap-aux-Meules and warrant exploration. Bassin is a seaside community
of mansard-roofed homes; La Grave has a single street of shingled
galleries and a theater.</TE>
<TE>   At L'Etang-du-Nord a cluster of clapboard shops includes the Cafe
la Cote, whose specialty is a salt cod pizza served on a deck
overlooking one of the most recent shipwrecks, the Duke of Connaught,
a casualty less than two decades ago. The Duke's angular hulk has
rusted into the same red as the cliffs onto which it was swept.
Locals joke that it is the work of one of the islands' well-known
contemporary metal sculptors.</TE>
<TE>   But the tranquil soul of the islands lies on the web of rural
roads between farms, past marshes crowded with wading herons and
alongside endless beaches blurring into distant sea mist. Daisies and
buttercups lay siege to lush springtime fields. In autumn, buttery
rays of sun fire up the crumbling cliffs, rock stacks and 10 squat
lighthouses and add voltage to the electric colors of the gabled
homes, painted mauve or candy pink, orange or turquoise with lime
green or purple trim.</TE>
<TE>   Now landscape art, the vivid hues were originally an Acadian
tradition to transform houses into beacons for fishermen returning
from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Old-fashioned values prevail; churches are well attended on
Sundays, doors are rarely locked and keys are left in cars. "It's
like the rest of Canada in the 1950s," says Brigitte Michaud, who
recently moved from Montreal to run the Magdalens' tourism bureau.</TE>
<TE>   But in many ways the outward rural appearances are deceptive.
Homes are well stocked with the latest electronics, new cars are
parked in almost every garage and residents are affluent enough to
make frequent trips abroad and annual winter pilgrimages to the sun.
Women are smartly clad, even if only pushing prams down country
roads. And like the French everywhere, they love their festivals and
their cuisine, which is increasingly attracting "foodies" from the
Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "We have wild boar pate, fresh duck eggs and snow crab," says
Dominique Gagnon, who runs Au Salange. A wine buff, he holds regular
tastings that quickly sell out and spends months in Bordeaux or
Australia during the winter.</TE>
<TE>   He is also an avid chef and creates wonderful breakfasts for his
guests. Over scones slathered with thick cream--from cows grazing
outside his window--and homemade wild strawberry jam, he continues to
describe the local gourmet fare to me. "There is lobster, mackerel,
halibut," he says. "Mussels and scallops are cultivated too." The
herring smokehouse is legendary, and Pied-de-Vent cheese is sought
after across the province. There is even a food festival every
spring.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of rural Quebec also have a bounty of fresh products,
but rarely are they woven into the innovative menus of first-class
restaurants as they are in the Magdalens, eateries like La Table des
Roy that would draw rave reviews in cuisine-savvy Montreal. During
our dinner there I ordered a delicious dish of sweetbreads with local
prawns; Philip loved his bouillabaisse, a flavorful seafood soup/stew
made with local catches. La Maree Haute restaurant recently won a
provincial culinary award for its seal filet with pomme de pre, a
local cranberry, which we both ordered and thoroughly enjoyed. Seal
does not taste fishy but is strongly flavored like game meat.</TE>
<TE>   When not dining on haute cuisine or taking long, leisurely lunches
by the sea, we explored along Route 199, a country road that knits
together the seven main inhabited islands. It was completed in 1956;
before then, residents had to row or wait for low tide to travel from
island to island.</TE>
<TE>   Even today each island has a distinctive French dialect; those
from Havre Aubert roll their "r's," while Ile du Havre-aux-Maisons
residents are recognizable by the absence of that letter in their
vocabulary. I speak just enough French to get myself into trouble but
could tell that the accents were different from what I hear in
Montreal and that they also vary from island to island. "The story
goes that 18th century residents of the island hated French royalty,"
Father Frederic Landry, a locally born priest and historian, tells
me, "and they vowed never again to use the letter 'r' as in roi, the
French word for 'king.'"</TE>
<TE>   Driving east away from the island of Cap-aux-Meules, we crossed a
short bridge to Ile du Havre-aux-Maisons, then skipped onto Dune du
Nord, a long thread of sand leading to the island of Grosse-Ile,
where kayakers paddled the calm waters of the lagoon on my right. On
my left, steady winds smashed rollers onto a beach where Eric
Marchand zipped along in a three-wheeled buggy attached to a giant
kite.</TE>
<TE>   "By wind is the best way to see the islands," says Marchand, known
as the "kite guru." He runs an outdoor adventure shop that offers not
only "kite-buggying" and "kite-kayaking" but also "kite-surfing," a
new sport in which he is world champion.</TE>
<TE>   Strapping a surfboard to his feet, he skimmed across the water
clinging to the cables controlling a rambunctious kite; I did not
feel adventurous enough to give it a try, preferring, in the howling
winds, to keep my feet on dry land. The persistent wind is as much a
feature of the landscape as the sand and sea. Doorways are tethered
with old leather belts or rope to keep them from ripping off hinges;
power lines are strung low to duck the gales.</TE>
<TE>   La Table des Roy maitre d' Michel Bonato learned island
housekeeping tricks from his mother-in-law when he married a
Madelinot and moved here from France. "I can now hang laundry in
winds up to 40 mph," he says, only half-joking. There is even a wind
festival each August.</TE>
<TE>   I knew we had reached the island of Grosse-Ile without consulting
my map. Gone were houses the color of lobster floats, replaced by
weathered gray clapboard or shingle on a rolling landscape
reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. Grosse-Ile is home to most of
the islands' 800 English speakers. About 150 of them live on tiny
Entry Island, a short ferry ride from Cap-aux-Meules. While the
French are linked culturally with Quebec, the English community has
strong ties with New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island,
the Maritime Provinces. The French and English communities are
culturally strong and live largely in their separate enclaves, but
they still mingle freely.</TE>
<TE>   We left the English community and continued driving to the
easternmost island in the archipelago, reaching a vast wilderness of
deserted beaches and marshland accessible only by loops of boardwalk
or by boat. Pointe-de-l'Est National Wildlife Area is a lush
sanctuary, and from the short boardwalk trail we could see why the
area is popular with bird-watchers. We rented bikes and picked up
picnic lunches in Cap-aux-Meules and rode off, watching fishing boats
heading out to sea and kayakers threading through the archway of
Elephant Rock. Or we headed to the shore of one of the lagoons to
watch herons fishing or had a lazy afternoon of reading on a remote
beach. There are few places on the islands where the ocean is not in
plain view.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing is still the main industry. Lobsters are the most
lucrative catch, most of them caught on Ile de la Grande-Entree at
the eastern tip of the islands. It is one of the biggest lobster
fishing harbors in Quebec and the site of the Lobster Festival each
July, although delicious lobster pie can be enjoyed throughout the
summer at the local cafe, Delice de la Mer. We were lucky to have
lunch there on the last day before it closed for the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Among the boutiques in Grande-Entree, one shop sells designer
hats, mitts and vests made of sealskin, a commodity the islands were
once known for. Sealing continues on a small scale, but not of pups.
The dark, rich meat appears on most island menus as anything from
sausages and terrine to loup-marin en bourgignon (loup-marin, or "sea
wolf," being the local term for seal), served at the homey Petite
Baie Restaurant. Had I not known it was seal I would have thought it
was moose or another tender game meat.</TE>
<TE>   "Gone blueberry picking," read a note stuck to the door of
L'Aquarelle B&amp;B when we arrived to check in. "Your room is the one
overlooking the sea. Make yourself at home." We stepped into the
purple 19th century house expecting to be alone and were startled by
a slim man with a trim white beard cheerfully stuffing home-grown
pink and yellow roses into mayonnaise jars and water glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonjour! I'm Jean-Marc. I just dropped by with some flowers," he
said. We headed up to our room with its charming country decor, the
walls decorated with the innkeeper's watercolors. (Aquarelle is
French for "watercolor.")</TE>
<TE>   The owners returned later that afternoon. Micheline Boucher, who
has a cloud of white hair styled by the winds and eyes as blue as the
berries that stained her hands, made coffee and set out island-made
chocolates. Her husband, watercolorist Louis Bernier, grabbed a
sketch pad and joined us on the front steps overlooking the historic
fishing village of La Grave. As the salty sea air mingled with the
sweet smell of blueberries, Micheline explained that the couple had
been vacationing on the islands for 20 years. In 1996, both quit
their busy jobs in Quebec City and moved to Les Iles to run an inn
and to paint. "For us living here is like heaven, a dream come true,"
said Micheline, a former nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Providing sanctuary from the stresses of the outside world is not
a new role for the Magdalen Islands. They have long been a refuge not
only for English castaways but also for French Acadians expelled from
Nova Scotia by the British in 1755, some fleeing as far afield as
Louisiana. "They landed right here," said Father Landry, fisherman's
cap on his head, as we strolled La Grave's pebble beach. "There were
250 people, and the surnames of all those 21 pioneer families still
populate the islands' telephone book." Their flag, the Acadian red,
white and blue with a gold star, adorns houses, cars and boats
throughout the Magdalens.</TE>
<TE>   La Grave, the island's only natural harbor and until 50 years ago
its main town, is on Havre Aubert, a slower-paced, more traditional
island than the others and one known for its arts.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the modern Musee de la Mer, the maritime museum founded
by Father Landry, the town's buildings, strung along a single main
road leading to the fishing dock, date from the 19th and early 20th
centuries. Among them is a theater that attracts performers from
France. Others are now galleries and studios showing the works of
local oil painters, jewelers and sculptors.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most unusual is Les Artisans du Sable, run by Albert
Cummings. He and a group of four artists developed a process to mix
epoxy with the islands' most abundant commodity--sand--to create a
rock-like substance that can be carved with lathes into bowls, vases,
plates and sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   With the departure of summer tourists, restaurants and cafes
across the islands were closing for winter when we visited. The few
still open had become, like shrinking water holes, busier and noisier
with locals. Cafe de la Grave, with its clapboard walls, shelves
stocked with stacks of magazines and no two chairs or tables
matching, was adorned with an exhibition of Bernier's watercolors. I
ordered the island specialty--pot-en-pot, a seafood stew in a flaky
crust--while Philip had seafood pasta in a light cream sauce.</TE>
<TE>   As the wine flowed and the laughter grew giddier, the cafe's
jovial owner, whom I recognized as the flower-arranging Jean-Marc
Cormier, sat at the upright piano and launched into peppy show tunes
and ragtime. Island-born Cormier attended a prestigious Montreal
music academy, but like so many Madelinots, he returned and never
left. He teaches music at the local school.</TE>
<TE>   When he slowed for a melancholy French ballad, everyone joined in.
I felt as though I had been dropped onto the set of a 1940s European
cabaret film.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping out into the puddle of light spilling from the cafe into
the darkness of the fishing village, we walked slowly back toward the
inn, the music and tinkling of glasses fading into silence.</TE>
<TE>   After a week in this peaceful outpost we were reluctant to return
to Montreal. So before boarding our flight the next morning we did
the only sensible thing we could think of: We reserved a refuge for
ourselves, a beachfront cottage for next September.</TE>

<HD>Trying to Steer Clear of the Smoking Lounge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The glassed-in smoking lounges in airports are a kind of hell Dante
never envisioned. Hazy, reeking and generally full of
desperate-looking people, they seem far worse than the entryways of
office buildings where nicotine addicts light up. At least those
doorway dwellers don't have to breathe such a concentration of
secondhand smoke.</LD>
<LD>   Paul G. Billings, an assistant vice president with the Washington,
D.C.-based American Lung Assn., says it's hard to quantify how much
the inhalation of secondhand smoke in such airport lounges increases
the risk of cancer for those who visit the toxic little rooms for one
last cigarette before a flight. "It's just a horrible environment,"
he says.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling is stressful, so I can see why smokers--25% of the adult
population in the U.S., according to a Surgeon General's
report--would feel the need to light up between connections. I feel
sorry for smokers because they are consigned to these wretched
corners of airports, but as an occasional smoker, I also would rather
fall into a mud puddle than visit an airport smoking lounge. Whether
airports should have such lounges or be entirely smoke-free is an
issue that affects anyone who trudges through the concourse.</LD>
<TE>   Congress banned smoking on U.S. passenger flights of two hours or
less in 1988. On June 4, 2000, smoking was officially prohibited on
all scheduled passenger flights of U.S. carriers and on flights to
and from the U.S. by foreign carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "We sometimes forget how bad it was," says Billings, who thinks
the airline smoking ban helped galvanize public awareness about the
dangers of secondhand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   I vividly recall a Balkan Bulgarian Airlines flight from New York
to Sofia, Bulgaria, eight years ago on which I was horrified to
discover that most of the passengers chain-smoked. It was awful. I
got nauseated, and I didn't care for Sofia either.</TE>
<TE>   The drive to make airports smoke-free started more than a decade
ago as the various municipalities that oversee them began prohibiting
smoking in public buildings. In 1991, San Francisco International was
among the first to institute a no-smoking policy. At first the
airport provided rooms for smokers, but these lasted only about a
year. Ron Wilson, a San Francisco International Airport spokesman,
says mothers took their kids into the lounges and that simply opening
the door was like smoking a pack. When the ventilation system filters
were removed for cleaning, they were "totally black," Wilson says.
The airport has gone to a total smoking ban, though people can smoke
in a few designated areas outside.</TE>
<TE>   Denver International Airport, which opened in 1995, has two
interior smoking areas, one before security checkpoints and one
beyond. Neither is walled off from the rest of the airport. They are
equipped with ventilators that don't attempt to purify the smoky air
but exhaust it outside. They are operated by a concessionaire, which
requires people to buy food or a beverage to use the areas.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Municipal Airport, Orange County's John Wayne Airport
and Ontario International Airport prohibit smoking inside the
terminals. LAX has interior courtyards in Terminals 3 and 6 to
accommodate smokers; now-shelved plans for the renovation of Tom
Bradley International Terminal included interior smoking lounges.</TE>
<TE>   In March, when Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights got wind of the
plans to add smoking lounges at LAX and a few other major U.S.
airports, the Berkeley-based nonprofit organization mounted a
campaign to stop them. "Societal norms have changed," says Cynthia
Hallett, the group's executive director. "We expect the inside of
buildings to be smoke-free."</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights opposes concourse smoking lounges
as well as restaurants and bars with smoking areas, even if they are
equipped with ventilation systems. Hallett says such systems remove
odor and make smoking areas more pleasant but don't address the
health dangers of secondhand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   She says cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris is partly
responsible for the incorporation of such smoking areas inside
airports.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., says the
company helped finance construction of smoking lounges in airports
like Las Vegas' McCarran International in the mid-'90s as part of its
Options program, which is designed to help owners of restaurants and
bars (many of them inside airports) deal with the growing body of
regulations limiting smoking in public places. McCormick says this
largely entails offering business owners advice on how to segregate
smokers from nonsmokers using, among other things, high-tech
ventilation.</TE>
<TE>   Customer service is enhanced when concessionaires provide
comfortable places for people to smoke, McCormick says. A survey
conducted last year by Airport Interviewing &amp; Research Inc. for
Philip Morris showed that 60% of passengers at 10 major U.S. airports
think smokers should have a place to light up inside airports as long
as such places are properly ventilated.</TE>
<TE>   I know this will sound hypocritical because I'm a smoker and I
think people should be able to smoke if they want to. But I also know
that secondhand smoke is a potent carcinogen. Smokers should never
compromise the health of people, especially children, who want
nothing to do with cigarettes. So I favor smoke-free airports, having
landed at cigarette-butt-strewn airports in Jordan and China and
other places where smoking is tolerated. If smoking lounges and
concession areas can be built so they don't jeopardize nonsmokers, I
favor them too--but not just for the sake of nonsmokers. I'd like to
see the people in those awful glassed-in rooms released from the
worst kind of airport hell.</TE>

<HD>Wellington's Storied Past</HD>
<DH>Writer Katherine Mansfield's home celebrates her legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLE VAN GRONDELLE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>WELLINGTON, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Virginia Woolf once wrote that the only
writer she was ever jealous of was her friend and fellow Bloomsbury
Group member Katherine Mansfield. D.H. Lawrence memorialized her as
Gudrun, one of the sisters in "Women in Love."</LD>
<LD>   Considered one of the 20th century's finest short-story writers,
Mansfield was born and reared in this small colonial city at the turn
of the last century. Although she fled at age 19 for the bright
lights of London, her memories of Wellington stayed extraordinarily
vivid. Some of her most luminous stories--"At the Bay," "Prelude,"
"The Dolls' House" and "The Garden Party"--were drawn from her
childhood in Wellington.</LD>
<LD>   The British, Japanese and French embraced Mansfield's writing long
ago; many Americans are now discovering its haunting beauty. Like
most New Zealanders, I was raised on Mansfield's stories.</LD>
<TE>   After recently returning to Wellington from abroad, I felt a need
to reconnect with the capital city's most famous literary export, so
I decided to visit the places that played a role in her life and
stories.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible to trace much of Mansfield's early life in
Wellington in a day. Although a sizable slice of Thorndon, the
fashionable central-city suburb where she was born and spent most of
her childhood, was cleared for a freeway in the 1960s, many of the
places mentioned in her letters, diaries and stories still stand.
They include two of the houses she lived in; schools she attended;
and houses, gardens and buildings she visited, including the
magnificent downtown Edwardian Bank of New Zealand headquarters (now
a shopping arcade), where Mansfield's father, Sir Harold Beauchamp,
was chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield's family was a prosperous and conventional one. Her
father was a self-made man whom she described as "thoroughly
commonplace and commercial." Her mother was beautiful and socially
ambitious but aloof and often absent from her children.</TE>
<TE>   As the awkward middle child of four sisters and a brother,
Mansfield was a rebel from the start. Overweight and bespectacled,
she was known as the difficult one, an outsider intense in her
feelings and given to outbursts of jealousy and fury.</TE>
<TE>   Her childhood was not unhappy, however. She did not lack for
anything, including large dollops of loving care from her mother's
mother, Granny Dyer, who lived with the Beauchamps. And her father's
riches provided a wealth of early experiences that Mansfield later
captured with deep affection in her writings.</TE>
<TE>   I began my tour in Thorndon, went next to the western suburb of
Karori, where she grew up, and ended up in Muritai and Days Bay,
where the Beauchamps spent their summer holidays. You can take the
freeway to Days Bay, but I decided a more interesting and authentic
option was to travel as the Beauchamps would have and take the ferry
across Wellington Harbor from Queen's Wharf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a small town, you know," Mansfield wrote in "Daphne,"
"planted at the edge of a fine deep harbor like a lake. Behind it, on
either side, there are hills. The houses are built of light painted
wood. They have iron roofs colored red. And there are big dark plumy
trees massed together, breaking up those light shapes, giving a
depth--warmth--making a composition of it well worth looking at."</TE>
<TE>   Thorndon</TE>
<TE>   My first stop was the Katherine Mansfield Birthplace at 25
Tinakori Road, five minutes' drive from the central city. It was here
that Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp was born on Oct. 14, 1888. (She was
called by many names--Kass, Katie, Katiushka--but was known by most
as Katherine.) The square, two-story timber house was built that same
year by Mansfield's father, then a young merchant. He was later
knighted for his services to commerce and banking.</TE>
<TE>   The birthplace, today painted cream with a red iron roof, has been
meticulously restored and furnished with antiques and replicas of the
original wallpapers and furnishings. You also can watch a 50-minute
documentary on Mansfield's extraordinary life. It celebrates her
brilliance but also makes plain the high price she paid for her "new
woman" ideals--an unplanned pregnancy, miscarriage, a gonorrhea
infection and TB, which killed her at the tragically early age of 34
in France.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine spent her first five years in this house. On the front
lawn calla lilies grew wild, and the upstairs bedrooms looked out
over the breakwater of the harbor. In "Prelude," Kezia is standing at
an upstairs window when "the day flickered out and dark came. With
the dark crept the wind snuffling and howling. The windows of the
empty house shook, a creaking came from the walls and floors, a piece
of loose iron on the roof banged forlornly."</TE>
<TE>   Walking around the corner from Mansfield's birthplace, I came to
Fitzherbert Terrace, in many ways the heart of Mansfield's life in
Wellington and the place where she began her writing career. She
attended school here, and it was her last home in New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Today there is a small memorial garden dedicated to Mansfield on
one side of the street. From age 12 to 14, Mansfield, with her older
sisters, Vera and Chaddie, attended Miss Swainson's School at 20
Fitzherbert Terrace, in a large wood house that is now gone. (Miss
Swainson's later moved to Karori and became the exclusive Samuel
Marsden College.) At Miss Swainson's, Mansfield wrote her own "school
magazine," featuring stories and jokes. Music also captured her
interest at this time, and she learned to play the piano and took
cello lessons with "old Mr. Trowell."</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, in April 1907, within a few months of
Mansfield's return from her first visit to London (where she
completed high school with her sisters), the Beauchamps moved into a
very large house at what was originally No. 4, then 47 Fitzherbert
Terrace. (The U.S. Embassy now occupies the site.) Like its
neighbors, this house was built of timber made to look like stonework
at the front, with a handsome pillared porch. Mansfield had her own
room upstairs, in which she spent much time writing.</TE>
<TE>   By now, 18 and having tasted London's cultural sophistication, she
was bored by New Zealand and raged against her confinement in the
small colonial city. She wrote bitterly of "this monotonous terrible
rain ... the narrow, sodden, mean, draggled, wooden houses,
colorless, save for the dull coarse red of the roof, and the long
line of the gray hills, impassable, spectral-like." In her upstairs
aerie she wrote several short prose pieces under the name K.
Mansfield or K.M., and three were accepted for publication in
Australia, a major achievement for an 18-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield lived there only until July 1908, when she left for
England, never to return. I left Fitzherbert Terrace and spent an
hour exploring other areas of Thorndon that Mansfield knew well. I
walked around the corner into Hobson Street, one of the city's most
exclusive thoroughfares. Nearby, at the corner of Aitken and
Molesworth streets, is the National Library of New Zealand, which
holds one of two major international collections of Mansfield's
papers, as well as photographs and personal possessions such as her
Chinese silk shawl. (The other major collection is at the Newberry
Library in Chicago.) The National Library also recently acquired the
journals of English writer and critic John Middleton Murry, who was
first Mansfield's lover and then her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Karori</TE>
<TE>   I returned to my car outside the writer's birthplace and headed
south toward Karori on Tinakori Road, past the city's beautifully
tended botanic gardens, which Mansfield loved and visited often. The
road is steep and winding, but the signage is clear, and the journey
took about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Karori was the first of the outlying valleys to be opened up for
settlement in the new colony. In Mansfield's day it was Wellington's
rural fringe. Today it is the city's biggest suburb and solidly
middle class. It was at the valley's farthest end, beneath hills that
led to the coast, that Beauchamp bought a 14-acre property called
Chesney Wold in 1893. The family's shift from the city is preserved
in "Prelude," and references to the Karori home and local school
occur in several stories.</TE>
<TE>   Mansfield was 5 when the Beauchamp family moved to Karori. She
began her education at the Karori School, which has been at the
corner of Donald Street and Karori Road since the 1870s. One Karori
resident of the 1890s remembered how "every morning for several years
I used to meet Kathleen Beauchamp, a fat little girl, trailing along
well behind her sisters" as they walked to school. Her grades show
that "Kass" was good at arithmetic and poetry, but poor at spelling
and handwriting.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped my car outside 372 Karori Road. In Mansfield's day,
Chesney Wold stood in a large garden, surrounded by paddocks,
orchards and various stables and farm buildings. The house faced
east, at right angles to the road, and a circular drive swept around
an area of lawns and flower beds.</TE>
<TE>   Still a private home, the house has been substantially altered,
and the gardens and paddocks have been replaced by more houses.
However, Karori Park is still behind the house as it was in
Mansfield's day, and the stream described in "Prelude," where Pat
"the storeman" caught and beheaded the duck for dinner, continues to
flow, ducks still living on its banks.</TE>
<TE>   The Beauchamp family remained at Chesney Wold until Mansfield was
91/2. In her last two years here, Katherine, with her sisters,
attended Wellington Girls' High School, and as I drove back into the
city I thought of the Mansfield girls traveling by a "dreadful
jolting bus" drawn by three horses along the winding road to school
each day.</TE>
<TE>   Muritai</TE>
<TE>   From the late 1890s, the Beauchamp family frequently spent summer
holidays on the eastern side of the harbor, which was accessible only
by steamer then. Today I had several choices: Drive around the
harbor, take the bus or take a half-hour ferry ride directly to Days
Bay. I chose the latter and made my way to Queen's Wharf, site of the
ferry terminal.</TE>
<TE>   As we crossed the water, I saw the big, bush-smothered hills
behind these bays that inspired the setting of "At the Bay," as
perfect a distillation of New Zealand's mystical beauty as there ever
was: "Ah--aaah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came
the sound of little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping
between smooth stones, gushing into ferny basins and out again."</TE>
<TE>   The Beauchamps' vacation houses are private homes now, but they
provide an excellent excuse to stroll the narrow foreshore and get a
view of the Wellington skyline in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   Before setting out, I rewarded myself with a casual lunch of a
chicken sandwich with spinach, feta, sun-dried tomatoes and basil
pesto, topped off by a slice of decadent "chocolate fish cake" at the
new Chocolate Dayz Cafe at Days Bay. As I ate I admired the view over
the water and the relaxed beachfront atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 minutes' walk around the shore is pretty Eastbourne
Village, with art and craft galleries, boutiques and other eateries.
The Beauchamps' first holiday house is another 15-minute walk along
Muritai Road, opposite Puriri Street. A white wood house with an
olive gray roof and a white brick chimney, it can be glimpsed through
trees behind 283 Muritai Road.</TE>
<TE>   The old general store belonging to Mrs. Stubb, a character in "At
the Bay," has long been demolished, and the paddock over which
Stanley Burnell, another character in the short story, bounded to the
beach in a broad-striped bathing suit is also built over with houses.
When I returned to the Days Bay Wharf to wait for the ferry to
Wellington, I looked north across the water to a cottage perched on
rocks. Beauchamp bought the land and built the cottage for the family
in 1906. The family holidays at Muritai and Days Bay later inspired
some of Mansfield's finest writing.</TE>
<TE>   "At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode past him,
and broke along the beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty! And now
there came another. That was the way to live--carelessly, recklessly,
spending oneself.... To take things easy, not to fight against the
ebb and flow of life, but to give way to it--that was what was
needed. It was this tension that was all wrong. To live--to live! And
the perfect morning, so fresh and fair, basking in the light, as
though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to whisper, "Why not?'"</TE>
<TE>   For many of Mansfield's admirers, "At the Bay," written only two
years before her death, captures the essence of New Zealand as
vividly today as it did then.</TE>

<HD>Disease Onset Yields Challenges--and Friend</HD>
<DH>Moses Remedios' Parkinson's led to meeting the daughter of
another victim: Muhammad Ali.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several years ago, a USC Medical School professor showed her class a
large depiction of Parkinson's disease. The series of drawings
followed something like the evolution of man but in reverse, starting
with an upright man and ending with a figure hunched over and
shaking.</LD>
<LD>   Moses Remedios whispered to a fellow student, "Out of all the
awful things we've learned about, this disease is the one I hope I
never get."</LD>
<LD>   "Famous last words!" he says now, recalling that the lecture came
only a short time before his diagnosis with Parkinson's. He sees the
cruel coincidence, but opens his mouth wide anyway to share a long
laugh with a new friend.</LD>
<TE>   That friend is May May Ali, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, who also
suffers from Parkinson's. She has tried to help her father fight the
disease, and is now watching Remedios wage a similar fight. It's a
fight tinged with, of all things, laughter--a lot of laughter.</TE>
<TE>   But friendship is like that. Although they hadn't met until March
3 at the Los Angeles Marathon and are still getting to know each
other, Remedios and Ali have formed a warm bond that helps them get
by, that lets laughter ring.</TE>
<TE>   Both volunteered for Team Parkinson, an organization that gathers
pledge money for medical research against the disease. Remedios had
seen Ali at a previous Team Parkinson event, but had never met her.</TE>
<TE>   When they did meet, Remedios came running up behind, unable to
resist a joke about her dad. "Someone's moving like a butterfly!" he
said. And they started to laugh.</TE>
<TE>   It was a relief from the anxiety related to the run. In declining
health and only a couple weeks away from liposuction, he didn't know
if his disease would prevent him from finishing.</TE>
<TE>   Since the diagnosis almost two years ago, the disease had sapped
him quickly.</TE>
<TE>   When the shaking started, he was pulling long hours at his job as
a physician's assistant at County-USC Medical Center, and drinking a
lot of bad coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean a lot of bad coffee," he told Ali. He wondered if the
coffee was the problem.</TE>
<TE>   It took a while to reach a diagnosis--long enough for Remedios to
see four doctors without a result. But the fifth one, after a few
moments with him, saw some of the tell-tale signs: faster fatigue on
one side over the other, uneven walk.</TE>
<TE>   He had Parkinson's at 31.</TE>
<TE>   Remedios was also, of course, fully aware of the battle underway
in his body. He could tell his family and friends, in precise terms,
how much mobility he had already lost.</TE>
<TE>   His sister, a doctor herself, wouldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "In five or 10 years, I may be out of the work force," Remedios
said.</TE>
<TE>   His supervisors at USC were generous when he told them.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I would always have a job. They said I could teach if I
couldn't practice myself," Remedios said, fighting tears. "Working in
medicine is at the center of my identity."</TE>
<TE>   Now, "my favorite patients to see are the older patients with
Parkinson's because they are trembling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When a bewildered and elderly woman came in for treatment of the
disease recently, Remedios was able to put her at ease. She spoke
Korean, so through a translator, Remedios said, "You shake? I do
too."</TE>
<TE>   "She smiled," Remedios said.</TE>
<TE>   His decision to run the marathon was surprisingly late, just three
weeks before the race.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone in good health knows they could finish the race if they
put their mind to it," Remedios said. "When you are diagnosed with
Parkinson's, it becomes a question."</TE>
<TE>   Before the marathon, Remedios' partner, Mark Bauman, wrote on his
running shirt: "To the love of my life, go get 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Ali was happy when he caught up to her early in the race.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sort of a loner, and suspicious of people who meet me as my
father's daughter, but I'm also a good judge of character, and you
can just tell Moses is a nice man," Ali said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, just looking at him say 'Thank you,' 'Thank you,' 'Thank
you' to everybody who gave us a cup of water, you could tell he's a
nice man."</TE>
<TE>   They sang rap songs, whistled, danced and talked about
relationships. Under a billboard showing a picture of Ali's dad, they
took a picture, and when Ali couldn't take it any longer, Remedios
stood guard as Ali went to the bathroom behind a building.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was doing it!" Ali said. "There was no other way!"</TE>
<TE>   They laughed hard retelling the story. They finished the 26.2-mile
run in six hours, 33 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know for sure whether we would finish. I just knew I
wanted to run it with Moses," Ali said.</TE>
<TE>   They also laughed at how spectators chanted "Ali! Ali!" as she
neared the finish line, Ali dramatizing the way she had crossed her
fingers during the final steps, hoping she and Remedios would finish.</TE>
<TE>   Now the two carry on a friendship through e-mail and pizza at
Remedios' apartment. Remedios is trying to set up Ali on a date.</TE>
<TE>   When her father was in town, Ali invited Remedios to come down and
meet him at the Kinko's in Beverly Hills, where the old boxer was
copying passages from the Koran and the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Ali talked about the moments early in her
father's disease when she first noticed the effects on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Daddy, are you sad?' Because he was looking so
expressionless after a while," Ali said. "But that was the
Parkinson's mask, his wife told me."</TE>
<TE>   Remedios knew what she was talking about. "Usually when you meet
someone for an event like the marathon, you leave and don't have any
commonality to continue the relationship on," Remedios said. "That
isn't the case with May May."</TE>
<TE>   Ali, pretending the compliment was too generous, mockingly slapped
him and shouted, "Oh stop!"</TE>
<TE>   And they laughed.</TE>

Parkinson's disease, can be reached at 6412 Broadway Ave., Whittier,
CA 90606.</TE>

<HD>Two Transpacific Airline Passes Are the Keys to Dozens of
Asian Cities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, more and more Americans are visiting the great
cities of Asia. That's the only possible explanation for the success
of Asian airline passes introduced by Cathay Pacific Airlines and
emulated by Malaysia Airlines. To the avid traveler, these passes are
a key to visiting a vast area inexpensively.</LD>
<LD>   Cathay Pacific's All Asia Pass is the more expensive ($999) and is
a bit more limited. Travelers get round-trip air transportation from
Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York to Hong Kong, and then flights
from Hong Kong to the traveler's choice of as many of 16 other Asian
cities as they have time to visit within 21 days.</LD>
<LD>   The 17 cities allowed on the pass include all the big
ones--Denpasar, Bali; Tokyo; Manila; Singapore; Seoul; Taipei,
Taiwan; and Bangkok, Thailand, among them.</LD>
<TE>   But because you must visit each using Cathay Pacific only (and
Cathay Pacific flies to most of them only from Hong Kong), visiting
these 16 resembles the flight of a yo-yo; in most cases, you must
return to Hong Kong after visiting each city, then fly from Hong Kong
to the next. It might seem tempting to visit all of them, but it
isn't practical; airline schedules, seat availability, flight
connections and your own time and money constraints probably will
limit you to a few cities.</TE>
<TE>   My advice: Stay at least a few days in each place rather than
zooming to a dozen cities on a marathon quest.</TE>
<TE>   You must reserve all Cathay Pacific flights for your pass at least
30 days before departure (and even more time is recommended, given
that some flights may be sold out), and you may not use the pass
between May 13 and Aug. 12 of this year. Otherwise, you can fly until
Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Cathay Pacific pass must be purchased from a travel
agent. The $999 price is based on a $200 discount for members of the
airline's free CyberTraveler club, which you can join only online.
You'll need to print your membership confirmation before you can
purchase the pass at a discount at your travel agent's office.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysia Airlines' AccessAsia Pass starts at just $747 plus tax.
(Taxes will vary based on where you're flying.) That figure includes
a round-trip flight from Los Angeles (no other U.S. cities) to Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, and unlimited travel thereafter, for a maximum of
30 days (which can be extended for an extra payment; see below).</TE>
<TE>   The pass is good for 23 other Asian cities, including Beijing;
Bangkok; Denpasar; Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Hong Kong;
Jakarta, Indonesia; Manila; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Phuket, Thailand;
Shanghai; Taipei; and Tokyo. The $747 rate is valid from now until
May 31 and between Aug. 15 and Nov. 15. Travel between June 1 and
Aug. 14, or between Nov. 16 and Jan. 14, 2003, incurs a $150
peak-season surcharge.</TE>
<TE>   You can extend the Malaysia Airlines pass to 45 days for $150
more; to 60 days for $200 more; and to a maximum of 90 days for $300
more. You can add a stop in Sydney, Australia, or Auckland, New
Zealand, for $700 more.</TE>
<TE>   The Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific passes are sold only to
residents of North America and must be purchased within the United
States or Canada.</TE>
<TE>   To become a CyberTraveler on Cathay Pacific, go to
www.cathay-usa.com, then take the documents you've printed out to a
travel agent.</TE>
<TE>   For the Malaysia Airlines pass, book through a travel agent, call
(800) 552-9264 or get more information from www.malaysiaairlines.com.</TE>

<HD>A Provencal Melting Pot in Marseille</HD>
<DH>Immigrants' influence flavors port city's dining, shopping
and historic sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF KOEHLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MARSEILLE, France</DL>
<LD>MARSEILLE, France --The smell of fish was surprisingly powerful
inside the central metro station of the Vieux Port, or Old Port. Once
I was at street level and among the crowd, I understood why: The
morning fish market was in progress.</LD>
<LD>   Running along the end of the oblong port were makeshift trays
stacked with squid, eel, purple sea urchins, even red and orange
starfish. At one table an ugly monkfish was being weighed; at
another, a squirming octopus was held up for a customer's inspection.
Boats that had brought in the catch were being swabbed out nearby.</LD>
<LD>   The daily market is not a prettified folk tradition carried out
for tourists' sake. Crowds gather not to gawk but to buy. Few things
here are done with outsiders in mind, as I found out during a week I
spent visiting friends in Marseille this winter. Perhaps that is why
most travelers seeking an idyllic Provencal experience--flowering
fields of lavender and medieval villages perched on green, rolling
hills--steer clear of this city, fearing a dirty industrial eyesore.</LD>
<TE>   But behind its urban grittiness and working-class demeanor,
Marseille proved to be a fascinating city lush with ancient history,
bustling with activity and peopled with diverse and passionate
residents. There was much to do--and even more to experience.
Marseille is a rich mix of immigrants from Greece, Italy, Spain,
Armenia, West Africa, Indochina and, making up a quarter of the
city's 800,000 residents by some estimates, North Africa. It's
France's second-largest city, home to the biggest port in the
Mediterranean and the second biggest in Europe behind Rotterdam (in
the Netherlands).</TE>
<TE>   The city is sprawled across 16 arrondissements, but its heart
remains the Vieux Port, where a fat finger of water pokes into the
undulating landscape. Along wide quays, fishermen mend nets and
seamen lounge on benches reading newspapers in Greek and Arabic,
while busy channel traffic moves between rows and rows of moored
boats.</TE>
<TE>   I began each morning here browsing through the fish market on the
way to cafes lining the north side of the port. I tried half a dozen
of them, most with deep terraces arrayed with plenty of tables to
receive the first rays of sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Once fortified with breakfast, I was ready to wander through
Marseille's long and convoluted historical landscape. The Vieux Port
was merely a creek when Greek sailors from the city of Phocaea (in
present-day Turkey) landed here in 600 BC, as legend has it, just in
time for the wedding of the Ligurian king's daughter. The bride,
Gyptis, was to choose her groom from among the guests by handing him
a ceremonial cup of wine. She gave it to Protis, leader of the Greek
party. The couple was given the hill on the north side of the creek,
at what became the settlement of Massalia.</TE>
<TE>   Massalia flourished from the shipping trade and became a rival of
Carthage and ally to Rome. But when it backed the Roman general
Pompey instead of Caesar during the civil wars after the conquest of
Gaul (roughly France and Belgium today), Caesar took the city in 49
BC, confiscating the fleet and destroying trade. Massalia withered
and soon was surpassed in importance by other Provencal towns.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, remnants of the original Roman docks were uncovered,
as well as warehouses for dolia, the storage jars for grain, oil and
wine. Some are displayed at the Musee des Docks Romains, built on the
original site.</TE>
<TE>   Even more fascinating is the 3rd century Roman merchant boat in
the Musee d'Histoire de Marseille. The wooden boat, discovered in
1974, has been preserved through freeze-drying. Among the museum's
other relics are Greek ramparts and vestiges of Roman buildings found
during the construction of Centre Bourse, the shopping center where
the museum is housed. A fairly new exhibition details recent
excavations that include a necropolis, a medieval potters' quarter
and Greek wrecks abandoned in the mud near the docks.</TE>
<TE>   Marseille has always spun on cycles of prosperity and destruction,
regaining its stature as an important Mediterranean port in the 11th
century only to be pillaged by the Aragonese in 1423. By the 19th
century the city was thriving again as France's gateway to North
African and Asian colonies. New docks, Avant-Port de la Joliette,
were built north of the existing port in time for the opening of the
Suez Canal. Today La Joliette is an impressive array of cargo ships,
cranes and containers. I was in awe of the magnitude and complexity
of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Towering above La Joliette is the Cathedrale de la Major. With its
polychrome dark green and white patterned brickwork, it's one of the
city's most striking buildings. And with a length of 450 feet and a
main dome rising almost 210 feet high, it was one of the largest
cathedrals built in Europe in the 19th century. The Roman-Byzantine
design is dominated by a single nave, an airy space with three
vaulted galleries. The rest is equally striking: a facade with twin
towers, and an apse with a cluster of octagonal- and square-turreted
cupolas.</TE>
<TE>   Where the original hilltop settlement of Massalia once stood is Le
Panier, a warren of narrow streets settled by immigrants. Under
German occupation during World War II, this dense urban fabric hid
Resistance fighters, Communists and Jews. In August 1944 the Nazis
gave the quarter's 20,000 residents 24 hours to leave, then razed
nearly everything in the lower part of the Panier, between the
waterfront, Rue Caisserie and Grand Rue, by my measurement a swath
about a third of a mile long.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a sizable tangle of streets remains. I spent hours absorbing
sensory delights--sudden views of the mast-filled port, colorful
clothes drying on lines, the scents of exotic spices--and wandering
through a number of small, recently opened shops selling paintings,
pottery and handcrafted soaps, a local tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The single greatest attraction within the Panier maze is the
Centre de la Vieille Charite, a cultural institution in a palatial
17th century building, a former hospice for vagabonds and orphans.
The Vieille Charite houses two museums as well as its own rotating
expositions. When I visited, there was an exhibit of works by
Giacometti, Dubuffet, Dufy, Picasso and Chagall, among others, all
from the Musee Cantini, which specializes in post-World War II art.</TE>
<TE>   The Musee d'Archeologie Mediterraneenne here holds an important
collection of Egyptian antiquities plus Greek and Roman pieces found
in the Marseille area. I found the second museum, the Musee d'Arts
Africains, Oceaniens et Amerindiens, even more interesting. The
collection of masks, statues and ceremonial objects is vast, with
items from Benin, Vanuatu, even the Amazon. When I toured, the
complex was empty except for a class of art students sketching masks
from Ghana, Mali and Gabon.</TE>
<TE>   Then I headed back toward the Vieux Port, where all roads seem to
lead. The best known thoroughfare is the broad La Canebiere, flanked
by two areas especially worth exploring.</TE>
<TE>   On the north side is Belsunce, the heart of North African
Marseille. The streets reminded me of Morocco or Tunisia, not just
for the people but also for the shops: eclectic displays of mint,
olives, chandeliers, teapots and couscoussiers, the two-tiered pots
used to cook one of North Africa's signature dishes. Sweets shops
were crammed with honey-soaked pastries filled with almonds and
pistachios, and tall stacks of glistening, red and gold twists.</TE>
<TE>   On the south side of Canebiere is the hip Cours Julien area, full
of designer clothing stores, restaurants, bars and cafes. Home to 22
bookshops, Cours Julien is also known as Le Quartier du Livre, the
Book Quarter. Editions Parentheses sells its own imprints of art and
architecture books, a number on Marseille. I bought an excellent
guide detailing the city's architectural highlights since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The first building in my guide was architect Le Corbusier's
influential Unite d'Habitation. The concrete apartment complex is
interesting for its supporting pedestal stilts, deep-set multicolored
terraces and modular layout. A short bus or taxi ride from downtown,
the building is easy to visit--or to stay in. A small section has
been made into a moderately priced hotel, appropriately named Hotel
Le Corbusier, with a cafe on the third floor and a great view from
the roof.</TE>
<TE>   The panorama was even better at the Palais du Pharo, back near the
southern mouth of the Vieux Port. Parisian architect Hector-Martin
Lefuel, known for his 19th century additions to the Louvre, built the
palace for Napoleon III. (Next to it is the Sofitel and its more
moderately priced sister hotel, the Novotel.)</TE>
<TE>   The city's best view, however, is from its highest spot, the
Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde, a steep climb from the port. The
basilica dates to 1214, when a hermit lived here on the hill called
La Garde (the Guard) and built a chapel. The current Romanesque
Byzantine building, built in the mid-1800s, is topped by a 30-foot
gilded statue of the Virgin Mary.</TE>
<TE>   The panorama from the basilica draws people from across Marseille.
Standing there at sunset, I was struck as much by the diversity of
the people around me as by the beauty of the Provencal light, falling
softly on the city, the hills behind it and the islands offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous of these isles is Chateau d'If, the 16th century
fort-turned-prison used as a setting for Alexandre Dumas' "The Count
of Monte Cristo." (Chateau d'If is one of the city's biggest tourist
attractions; boats leave regularly from behind the fish market on
Quai des Belges.)</TE>
<TE>   After watching the sun slip into the Mediterranean, I headed
downhill to Quai de Rive Neuve and Bar de la Marine. The celebrated
haunt of writer and film producer-director Marcel Pagnol is the most
atmospheric place to partake of that evening tradition, the aperitif.
The tipple of choice here is the aniseed-flavored pastis.</TE>
<TE>   And for dinner? The city's most famous dish is bouillabaisse. With
one Michelin star and a long roster of celebrity guests, Miramar on
Quai du Port is the best-known choice downtown for this rich and
complex stew--or any other seafood specialty, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 minutes south along the windy, coastal Corniche President
John F. Kennedy is the two-Michelin-starred Le Petit Nice Passedat.
Also on the Corniche is the tiny, compact fishing port of Vallon des
Auffes and more fine restaurants, L'Epuisette and Fonfon.</TE>
<TE>   I found menus throughout the region infused not only with seafood
but also with the city's immigrant history: Tunisian, Lebanese,
Laotian, Italian. After dinner, a similarly vibrant scene awaits: 25
theaters, 10 concert halls, an Art Deco opera house in the Vieux
Port, a ballet troupe and music that ranges from Algerian rai to
reggae to rap.</TE>
<TE>   The city's cultural buzz grew louder when Marseille helped host
the 1998 soccer World Cup. New projects continue to spring up;
construction has started on a restaurant-and-bar zone near the docks,
and elegant 19th century apartment blocks are finally getting the
refurbishment they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Paris is three hours away on the Train a Grande Vitesse, or TGV,
which inaugurated a high-speed connection to Marseille last year. Not
surprisingly, Parisians are snapping up real estate, my Marseillais
friends say. More change is ahead, to be sure. But most locals don't
seem worried. From the look of things during my visit, Marseille has
handled 21/2 millenniums of change pretty darn well.</TE>

<HD>It's Clear-Cut: Converse Basin's Sequoias Were Once
Majestic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, Converse Basin at the southern end of the Sierra
Nevada nurtured one of the most majestic groves of giant sequoias on
Earth.</LD>
<LD>   Then the ax fell. Hard. Even by the cut-and-run logging standards
of the time, the clear-cutting of Converse Basin in the 1880s was
merciless. This destruction of the giant sequoias was not even that
profitable; by some accounts, fewer than half the trees cut down
reached mills and were processed into lumber.</LD>
<LD>   What remains is Stump Meadow, a lovely, somewhat surreal landscape
populated with huge, ghostly stumps and a few standing sequoias.
Ironically, the tallest, 269-foot Boole Tree, bears the name of the
general manager of the Sanger Lumber Co., Frank Boole, thought to
have ordered this particular tree spared.</LD>
<TE>   Boole Tree is the eighth tallest sequoia in the world and ranks
No. 1 in terms of base circumference, 112 feet. Estimated to be more
than 2,000 years old, the behemoth is the largest tree in America's
national forests. Boole Tree's stature is accentuated by its
isolation above the Kings River, where it towers over the rest of the
forest.</TE>
<TE>   The trail featured this week is a family-friendly loop leading to
Boole Tree. The path delivers wonderful views of Kings Canyon and the
park's high peaks.</TE>
<TE>   Your visit to the area won't be complete without two more stops in
Converse Basin. On your drive to the Boole Tree Trail, stop at the
Muir Snag, believed to be the oldest known giant sequoia. The tree,
now dead, was discovered by John Muir and is estimated to be more
than 3,000 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The second stop is the former site of the General Noble Tree,
which some recorded as about 300 feet high and 20 feet in diameter
when it was cut down in 1895 and sent to the World's Columbian
Exposition in Chicago. A short walk on a flat trail brings you to the
20-foot-high remains, called the Chicago Stump.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to trail head: The Boole Tree Trail is in Giant Sequoia
National Monument, just west of Kings Canyon and Sequoia national
parks. A good landmark is Grant Grove Village in Kings Canyon, off
California Highway 180.</TE>
<TE>   Follow California 180 north. Look for the turnoff for the Chicago
Stump (Forest Road 13S03) on the left about 41/2 miles north of the
village. Proceed two miles on this dirt road, then turn right on
Forest Road 13S6 and drive a tenth of a mile to the Chicago Stump
trail head.</TE>
<TE>   The turnoff for the Boole Tree is off California 180 about six
miles north of Grant Grove Village. Turn left on Converse Road (also
known as Forest Road 13S55), continue 21/2 miles and park at road's
end.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: To reach the Boole Tree, begin your ascent on a
well-built path that crosses hillsides cloaked in bracken fern and
manzanita. Switchbacks and railroad-tie steps aid the climb, which
passes through a forest of white fir, oaks, incense cedar and a few
young sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   Just short of a mile out, you'll crest a ridge, catch a glimpse of
the Middle Fork of the Kings River, then descend to a junction with a
short connector trail leading to Boole Tree.</TE>
<TE>   Return the same way you came, or add half a mile of hiking by
following the rest of the loop for excellent views of the river
canyon.</TE>

American Airlines miles (and 160 boxes of cereal) for $640 ("A
Passage to India Paved With Bran Flakes and Mueslix," Traveler's
Journal, March 31).</LD>
<LD>   Though I have not been in her position, I'm an obsessive miles
hoarder. Through various promotional and customer loyalty-building
programs, companies offer countless ways to earn frequent-flier
miles. Spend a buck and get back 2 cents', 10 cents', even a dollar's
worth of miles.</LD>
<LD>   * Use a credit card, get back 2 cents per dollar.</LD>
<TE>   * Rent a car, get 3 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Stay in a hotel, get 10 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Eat at certain restaurants, get 20 cents--22 if you use a
mileage-accruing credit card.</TE>
<TE>   * Buy Kellogg's cereal, get 50 cents per dollar. Or wait until
Kellogg's is on sale at $3, use a $1 coupon and pay $2 a box.</TE>

<LD>As the parent of two small children, I agree with Bill Jones'
assessment that children should not impose on adult facilities and
activities ("Unruly Traveling Kids," Letters, March 24). It astounds
me how often I see children at a Saturday night R-rated film or
bouncing around tables at quiet restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   But I am offended that he includes airline travel as an adult-only
venue. Airlines are not an adult luxury. Families with children
travel to attend family and school functions, see medical specialists
and take vacations.</LD>
<LD>   Travel with small children is no easy job, but it shouldn't be
made more dolorous by annoyed stares and unreasonable expectations.</LD>

<TE>   As the father of three young children, I agree with Jones that
they should be kept away from adult venues, among them gambling
casinos and adult-type resorts. However, I strongly disagree when he
includes places that are not adult venues.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous cruise lines not only welcome families but actively court
them. At Broadway shows, many children (depending on age and maturity
level) are better behaved than some adults. And airplanes are a form
of public transportation--for the use and benefit of all. If he has a
problem with children on airplanes, he should avoid public
transportation and use only charter services.</TE>

<TE>   Christina Tinglof ("Most Traveling Parents Are in Control,"
Letters, Feb. 17) is the scariest kind of parent of all, because she
honestly believes she is "responsible and considerate." By taking her
children to a four-star restaurant? By taking them to 30,000 feet
when they are sick or tired?</TE>
<TE>   What parents need to learn is not to take their children out in
public and then try to control them. Instead teach them to respect
and obey you by consistently setting and enforcing limits, so they
learn self-control.</TE>

<HD>Exploring a River's Depths</HD>
<DH>A PBS documentary follows the Hudson's history from crucial
waterway to polluted dump and back again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Formed by saltwater currents from the Atlantic Ocean mixing with
fresh water from the Adirondack Mountains, the Hudson River is only
315 miles long. Yet the waterway located in the Northeast corner of
the United States has been called America's river, inspiring artists
and writers and serving as a major transportation venue for the young
nation.</LD>
<LD>   The Hudson has also been the victim of over-commercialization and
pollution. Even today, because of the incessant dumping of industrial
chemical PCBs into the water, the fish are contaminated.</LD>
<LD>   With such a colorful and controversial history, it's no wonder
that the river is now the subject of a four-hour PBS documentary,
"Amer- ica's First River: Bill Moyers on the Hudson," arriving
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Moyers says he never paid much attention to the Hudson, though
he's lived in New York City for more than 30 years. "But one day,
maybe four or five years ago, my wife and I were crossing the George
Washington Bridge above the Hudson. It was a beautiful day, and the
river was spread out before us on both sides of the bridge. We said,
'We don't know much about that river.' We began to take a couple of
trips and look at it more closely."</TE>
<TE>   It took Moyers 18 months to raise the funds for the documentary,
an additional year to research the topic. "We put together this
first-class team and it took us two years to produce it," he says.
"This is the end of a four-year project, which is a gamble."</TE>
<TE>   It's a gamble, Moyers says, because he wasn't sure how to make a
documentary about the river interesting to the rest of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided the one way to do it was to make a good, beautiful
television show, because people like to watch beautiful things on
television," he says. "The second was to try to let people who didn't
know just what an important part the river has played in this
country's development and evolution. It's home to many of America's
firsts."</TE>
<TE>   Moyers hopes viewers around the country will look at their local
rivers, streams and lakes with "fresh eyes, just as I have looked at
this river with fresh eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The first two hours of the documentary examine the role the Hudson
River played in the development of the country's economy, culture,
literature, art and ideology. The river was also the site of one of
the major victories over the British during the American
Revolution--the bluffs where the river narrows at West Point.</TE>
<TE>   The Catskill Mountains inspired the satires of writer Washington
Irving and the adventure tales of James Fenimore Cooper, along with
such seminal landscape painters as Thomas Cole.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the documentary also looks at the vast
industrialization that took place along the river and explores the
roots of the conservation movement.</TE>
<TE>   "The second evening is about the difference citizens can make when
they care and love something enough," Moyers says. People such as
Robert Boyle, "who was a journalist working for Sports Illustrated
who took this [environmental crusade] on. It only takes a small group
of dedicated citizens to make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Boyle recalls that in the 1960s, the Hudson was in such poor shape
that it was a staple for humor in Johnny Carson's monologue on "The
Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   "There were very few people involved in the Hudson [conservation
effort] at that time," he says. "The pollution was rampant. At that
time, pollution was considered part of the American progress. I
recall a U.S. senator said at one point in the '60s, 'God made rivers
to carry away man's waste.' I also remember when the group called the
American Geographical Society put out a map of rivers of the East
Coast, the Hudson was black. I called them up and said, 'Why?' They
said it was because it was an industrial river. I said, 'By whose
authority?'"</TE>
<TE>   Angered at the plight of the river, Boyle and a partner formed the
Hudson River Fisherman's Assn. in 1966 to go after the polluters. And
he has never stopped his fight. "The one thing you can say about the
people I have known on the Hudson River over the years is that they
have persistence," he says. "You have got the knowledge; you have got
the smarts. What you really need to back it up is persistence."</TE>
<TE>   "America's First River: Bill Moyers on the Hudson" can be seen at
9 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday on KCET and KVCR.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Set to Buy Tollway Along 91</HD>
<DH>Transit: Agency agrees to pay the private operator $207
million for the Express Lanes. Board will vote Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County transportation officials have struck a deal to buy the
controversial 91 Express Lanes in a bid to speed improvements on the
chronically congested Riverside Freeway linking Orange, Los Angeles
and Riverside counties.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal reached Friday, the Orange County Transportation
Authority would pay California Private Transportation Co. $207.5
million for the 10 miles of toll lanes running from Riverside County
to the Costa Mesa Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The OCTA board of directors will consider the deal in a closed
session Monday. Board Chairman Todd Spitzer and director Michael Ward
said Saturday that the deal is likely to pass.</LD>
<TE>   Toll road officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Express Lanes, which opened in 1996, have provided relief for
commuters, but the project has come under fire because of a
noncompete clause, which prohibits public transportation agencies
from adding lanes or improving the freeway without compensating the
company.</TE>
<TE>   The company sued in 1999 when Caltrans tried to add lanes to a
stretch of the freeway, which it contended would divert customers
from the toll lanes. Later, Riverside County sued the private
operator, saying the agreement with the state was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "You have lawsuits going back and forth and meanwhile drivers are
sitting on those lanes unable to move," Ward, an Irvine councilman,
said Saturday. "This breaks the logjam."</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Ward, then OCTA chairman, sought ways to reduce
congestion on the Riverside Freeway, a major commuter route for the
rapidly growing Inland Empire. The noncompete clause, however, made
improvements costly.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, OCTA agreed to pay $4 million in public funds
to California Private Transportation for the right to ease a
bottleneck along a 1,000-yard stretch of freeway just east of Coal
Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA began negotiating in December to buy the toll lanes, which
cost about $135 million to build, in the early 1990s. Spitzer said
$207.5 million is a fair price to turn the lanes back into public
hands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like buying a house," said Spitzer, who is running for the
state Assembly in a district that lies mainly in Riverside County.
"You don't get to buy houses for what people paid for them 10 years
ago....</TE>
<TE>   "If we had to go out today and build that road ourselves, it's
equivalent to what we're paying."</TE>
<TE>   An earlier effort to buy the tollway by a nonprofit agency died
over the $274-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Ward and Spitzer said buying the turnpike was a better alternative
than doling out millions to the company for every improvement
project. Spitzer said 250,000 vehicles use the freeway each day.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do something about it today, then there is no hope
... given the amount of growth that's happening in the Inland
Empire," Spitzer said. "It will be good for commuters.... People will
see dramatic improvements over time."</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, OCTA will assume the toll road's $135-million
debt and make a one-time payment of $72.5 million, which includes the
$4 million OCTA agreed to pay in January for the improvement near
Coal Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature must still grant OCTA approval to charge
commuters a toll. OCTA officials said they plan to begin lobbying the
Legislature next week.</TE>
<TE>   If the purchase goes through, OCTA officials said they will look
into lowering tolls, now about $8 for a round trip during rush hour,
and making the Express Lanes free for carpoolers with more than three
people per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also said the OCTA purchase would free up funds from an
upcoming Riverside County ballot measure to spend $498 million on
freeway improvements, which is contingent on the noncompete clause
being eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The protection clauses were built into contracts negotiated
between the state and private road developers more than a decade ago,
when California lacked funds for transportation projects. Private
operators argued that freeway improvements would take customers from
the toll roads, so they needed to protect their investments.</TE>
<TE>   The protection clause for the 91 Express Lanes covers 30 miles,
from the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties to Interstate 15
in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County transportation officials face similar clauses with
the Eastern, Foothill and the San Joaquin Hills toll roads, all
operated by private companies.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said Saturday they had no plans to buy more private
roads.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the transit authority tried to have the state buy
all four toll roads including the 91 Express Lanes, but the
$3.5-billion price tag was too high.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said having a public agency run the toll roads will
benefit commuters.</TE>
<TE>   The private operator's "goal was to maximize profit," he said.
"Our goal at OCTA would be to maximize mobility, maximize the number
of vehicles that are able to use those toll lanes."</TE>

<CX>   Express Lane--An article in the April 21 California section about
the Riverside Freeway's privately run express lanes incorrectly described
the agencies that operate Orange County's other toll roads. The San
Joaquin, Eastern and Foothill tollways are run by the Transportation

<LD>As Nancy Cleeland documented in her article ("Organize or Die,"
March 10), Douglas McCarron's approach to organizing the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners has been a failure. McCarron
justifies his dictatorship on the grounds that it is streamlining the
union, cutting out the fat, getting rid of the old bureaucracy. But just
about every old conservative bureaucrat has retained his job under
McCarron's rule. The new ones who have been added usually have no history
of concern for the union. So how can the membership take them seriously
as union leaders?</LD>
<LD>   If the union is to survive and grow, it must fight for the interests
of the members, regain their loyalty and mobilize the present rank and
file to win over the nonunion carpenters. We need a raise that enables us
to buy the homes we build, an earlier retirement, a shorter workweek with
no loss in pay and strict contract enforcement. In the future we will see
new and bigger strikes as members fight to regain their union and use it
to better their lives.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two of the trustee defendants of McCarron's 1986 civil lawsuit were
Warren Driver and Jack Bernard. Warren is my father and Jack is a
longtime family friend who recently passed away. Investment errors may
have occurred with the carpenters' pension fund, but the underlying
motive of these men was to create jobs for the carpenters and fulfill
their duties as trustees. My father ran Los Angeles' oldest construction
company, C.W. Driver, which was founded by my grandfather in 1919. Its
reputation was impeccable.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit never sat well with Jack or my father in their retirement
years. Prior to my father's retiring, I started a small construction
company. Years after the lawsuit, McCarron's staff staged a picket line
at one of our job sites because we were nonunion. The protesters

<LD>Thanks to your magazine and writer Michael A. Hiltzik for the
article on the "Spider-Man" screenplay saga ("Untangling the Web,"
Special Hollywood Issue, March 24). One fact seems to get lost in the
myriad complications: no one at the Writers Guild has ever read the
screenplays concerned. Barney Cohen, Ethan Wiley, Neil Ruttenberg, Frank
LaLoggia, several others and I were never afforded a hearing by our
peers--that is, other writers. The accepted process of arbitration was
circumvented by a toss of a coin in the credits administration, which
didn't read the scripts either. Also, although I thought Hiltzik's
article was terrific, he misquoted me quoting Groucho Marx in "Duck
Soup." The line should be, "It's too late. I've already paid a month's
rent on a battlefield."</LD>

<TE>   Back in the mid-1980s, when Ted Newsom wrote regularly for magazines I
edited, I heard a great deal about his "Spider-Man" script. Although I
never saw the script, I figured it had to be at least as good as most
scripts in its genre. However, I also figured that it would never be
produced. Why? Because it's always been clear, even to outsiders, that
what matters in Hollywood is not talent but power. And while Ted had
plenty of the former, he had none of the latter. However, he did
have--and apparently still has--another quality that the powerful folks
in the industry may not be familiar with: persistence. My money is on him
to win in the end.</TE>

<LD>Vince Martinez taps the toe of his cowboy boot on the bare floor,
waiting for Ron Sotelo to finish searching. "You're skating on very, very
thin ice, Mr. Sotelo," he says. Sotelo, 47, gaunt, shirtless and
bleary-eyed, peels through bunched handfuls of papers and rummages in a
rickety night stand. Try as he might, however, he can't come up with the
doctor's letter that explains why he's been delayed in entering a drug
rehabilitation program at the L.A. Mission.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe there is a letter," Martinez says. "And, you're back
to using. I can read it in your face, in your eyes. You need to get back
in a program. Your other alternative is you're going back to jail."</LD>
<LD>   This encounter takes place in a shabby Skid Row-adjacent hotel room.
The setting, however, belies what is at stake for you and me. If
Martinez, a parole agent for the California Department of Corrections,
can keep Sotelo on parole for another year, it will cost us taxpayers
$2,636. If he can't, if he sends Sotelo back to prison for a year as a
parole violator, our bill will be nearly 10 times that, $25,607.</LD>
<TE>   Even that is pocket change compared to what we will pay if Sotelo
commits another crime. He already has done two stretches in prison, for
armed robbery and burglary. A third-strike offense could send him away
for 25 years to life, which would ring us up for the jackpot, a minimum
of $640,175.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez works in a special parole unit for so-called "second
strikers." A compactly built 38-year-old with swept-back black hair and
braided gold necklace, he worked for a decade as a corrections officer in
maximum-security lockups before switching five years ago to parole
agentry. Initially, Martinez was a stern, by-the-book man, "violating"
parolees back to prison for any transgression of the rules. He's since
learned the wisdom of flexibility, the importance of the larger picture.
"Our job is to keep these guys in the community," he says. "It's too easy
to just lock them up."</TE>
<TE>   Too easy and impossibly expensive. About 121,000 parolees live in
California (40,400 of them in L.A. County). The additional cost of
sending them all back to prison for a year would be $3.1 billion, not
even considering the cost of building additional facilities to
accommodate them among the 160,000 already locked up. The state's entire
corrections budget is only $4.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, parole is what has kept our broad-brush punitive approach to
criminal justice from bankrupting us. Yet we hate the idea of parolees in
our midst, because they tend to be hard to employ, substance addicted and
possessed of the prison-bred social skills of Neanderthals. Whenever the
corrections department tries to establish or expand a parole office to
meet the growing need, the local community rises up in ire.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Martinez works in the middle of this contradiction, visiting his
wards unannounced at their residences twice a month, searching their
belongings, demanding proof they're living up to the conditions of their
parole. He's learned when to bend to help his charges make it through
their three years of so-called "community custody."</TE>
<TE>   In the stuffy hotel room, Sotelo continues searching, avoiding
Martinez's eyes. At one point, in response to Martinez's relentless
questioning, he admits he smoked crack cocaine two days earlier. He
swears, however, that he's determined to do something about his drug use.
"I walk down the street, and people look at me funny," he says. "The
little children, they run away from me. I think, 'I have to stop this.' "</TE>
<TE>   And, from a last forlorn fistful of papers, he extracts the letter
from the doctor. Martinez reads it and considers Sotelo a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back in two hours to take you to the mission myself," he
says. "You be here, and you better be packed and ready."</TE>
<TE>   Sotelo in rehab again. Martinez knows it probably will prove futile.
He also knows, however, that a drug user typically has to try many
programs before he finds one that works for him.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's supervisor calls him "the toughest of all my agents." Yet
Martinez says his view of those under his authority has changed since his
maximum-security days. "Out here," he says, "you meet their families,
their wives and children. You see they're not just convicts. They're
people, and people make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, an appeals court ruled that California's judges should have
more discretion in third-strike cases and not be forced to levy automatic
life sentences for petty offenses. A year-and-a-half ago, California
voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, which allows nonviolent
drug offenders to be sent to rehab instead of prison.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, we as a society may be evolving along the same
trajectory as Martinez. Let's hope so. Wholesale incarceration of
offenders not only costs more than we can afford, but aggravates many of
our woes while at best postponing others. We keep packing these people
off, see, but they keep coming back to us.</TE>

<HD>Art History Is Moving to the Suburbs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>GINNY CHIEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Move over, Angelino Heights. Mid-century suburbia is the new
darling of architectural preservation. Urban historian Greg Hise, an
associate professor at USC's School of Policy, Planning and Development,
made a case for protecting L.A.'s postwar planned communities in a recent
lecture at the Getty Center. We asked the author of "Magnetic Los
Angeles: Planning the 20th Century Metropolis" (Johns Hopkins University
Press) about what makes tract homes special.</LD>
<LD>   Are you telling us that suburban tract houses could have the cachet of
Victorians and Craftsmen?</LD>
<LD>   Don't they already? Chronicle Books even published a design book about
Joseph Eichler houses. And the Gregory Ain tract  in Mar Vista is
immensely desirable. The fact that the Getty [Conservation Institute] and
the L.A. Conservancy are presenting this lecture shows that people are
paying attention.  Some of it is the 50-year designation. Some of it is
nostalgia. But this is just the beginning of a long conversation.</LD>
<TE>   What's distinctive about a postwar suburb?</TE>
<TE>   One critical difference is scale. These developments are much larger
than the ones found before 1945. And if you're building lots of houses,
what's the most efficient way to build quickly? Use a plan that's more
square, doesn't have things [protruding], like porches. [Also,] because
they were working with  such large areas, developers sold communities
rather than  just houses.</TE>
<TE>   Where do the barbecue and the pool fit in?</TE>
<TE>   The way houses are positioned on typical tracts of the '40s shows that
the emphasis is on cutting yourself off. This privatization turns the
backyard into an outdoor family room. Things that had been public can now
be private.</TE>
<TE>   What are L.A.'s best examples?</TE>
<TE>   You almost couldn't miss if you threw a dart at a map. But Lakewood is
a prime example. Panorama City and the San Fernando Valley were case
studies I developed in my book.</TE>
<TE>   Why preserve suburbs?</TE>
<TE>   It can help us see how we got here, and perhaps how to  get the city
we want for the future. I think Atlanta and  other cities developed
similarly to L.A. You can't really talk about a city without looking at
the suburbs. We need the whole picture.</TE>
<TE>   How do you preserve a suburb?</TE>
<TE>   Good question. Some of these houses were built from cheap material
that could be put up quickly. They were meant to be changed and adapted.
And if you only preserve the houses, I'd argue you're missing the
point.For example, Panorama City was developed with a retail district.
Designating the tracts are challenging issues. No one is about to declare
the San Fernando Valley a historic site.</TE>
<TE>   Is the homogenized suburban image fair?</TE>
<TE>   You'd be hard-pressed to find an "Ozzie and Harriet" family or a
"Leave It to Beaver" neighborhood. That just isn't reality. The simple
dichotomy of city and suburb doesn't cut it. Each type, like
working-class suburbs or industrial suburbs, has its own culture.</TE>
<TE>   How has suburbia shaped the L.A. character?</TE>
<TE>   For people who don't live here, I think suburbia is their image of
L.A. They tend to picture everybody driving. And where are we all going?
From our house in the suburbs, past strip malls, to a job in the city.</TE>

<LD>Invited to: Party to celebrate GQ magazine's Movie Issue and kick
off the monthlong "GQ Lounge" at the Sunset Room.</LD>
<LD>   Ladies first: "I thought there wouldn't be a single woman here," says
a pleasantly surprised Martin Landau, though few among the bevy of babes
would have predicted he'd show up. Indeed, while Selma Blair believes
"the magazine has a lot of dignity and doesn't have all the glossy, waxy
girls in it, you know," the publication's bash is another story. "I'm
single and there's some cute boys here," says Tara Reid, flirting with
running back Eddie George of the Tennessee Titans. "Not Another Teen
Movie" star Jaime Pressly (nice pinstripes, btw) says she's a huge fan of
highlight act Angie Stone, and Garcelle Beauvais shows herself in support
of the silent auction to benefit the Fulfillment Fund for economically
disadvantaged students, though the table is hard to find in the crush of
beautiful people. For "Talk Soup's" Aisha Tyler, well, "I've been in
Esquire and I've been in Maxim, the father of all men's magazines," she
explains. But how does that account for her presence here? "Well, you
know what?" she answers, "I think they want me."</LD>
<TE>   A man's business: "I was in town doing some stuff for "The Scorpion
King" video game. And I got a call. You know that thing, the
my-people-call-your-people," says pugilist thespian the Rock, who
represents one bookend on the continuum of Hollywood dudeness in evidence
tonight. Sensitive actor types a la Gary Sinise and the Brothers Wilson
also represent, as does I-vant-to-be-left-alone celebrity phenom Tobey
Maguire. "I've been reading GQ since I was 16. Can't you tell?" says a
wool-and-cashmere-garbed Chi McBride, who's taking a break from "Boston
Public" by reclining with stogie and highball in the Calvin Klein booth.
The much-hyped "GQ Lounge" turns out to be cross-promotional
hoo-ha--parties and clubs held in an environment of cool-retro Altoids
dispensers, movie trailers and what-have-you--in short, a live magazine
in the round, complete with ads. P. Diddy (trailing the party's biggest
posse) drops a little promo of his own vis-a-vis those ultra-fly
pink-on-gray pinstripe threads he's busting. "Yeah, you never heard that
combination," goes the word from the guy everyone still calls Puffy.
"It's special for Sean John, exclusive Diddy style."</TE>

<LD>Dan Volk of Monrovia never owned a paddleball as a child, but he's
made up for lost time in a big way. For "Bouncin' Dan the Paddleball
Man," getting a little rubber ball to bonk off of a wooden paddle is no
transient puerile fancy. It's an identity.</LD>
<LD>   Watching the Bouncin' Dan act, which Volk performs for parties,
festivals, amusement parks, museums, corporate events and the occasional
TV commercial, you're grateful there are no swords involved. Volk, 55,
smacks the ball up, down and sideways. He bounces it off his head. He
bounces the ball under his legs while dancing the cancan. He activates
multiple paddles. He ricochets a ball into his shirt pocket. One caroms
off of Volk's forehead, another rebounds into his mouth. "I'm just
getting started here!"</LD>
<LD>   Volk got his initiation into paddleball in 1976, at 29, when he landed
a promotional gig for Coca-Cola that lasted 12 years and took him to 20
countries. "They did both paddleball and yo-yo promotions, and I had to
perform both. It was a job skill," he says. After that, he briefly
promoted yo-yos, paddleballs and tops for the Hummingbird Toy Co. in New
York before creating the Bouncin' Dan persona.</LD>
<TE>   The paddleball was created in the 1920s after the invention of soft
rubber, Volk says, sparking a craze that peaked in 1937, when the toy was
featured in Newsweek. The best-remembered paddleball may be the Fli-Back,
"the one with the picture of a cowboy on a bucking bronco," says Volk,
who recently acquired the abandoned trademark of the Hi-Li, a popular
'30s name.</TE>
<TE>   The nostalgic allure of paddleball is a good fit for a whimsical man
who eschews contemporary fads in favor of vintage-style bowling shirts
and retro black plastic glasses. Volk's collection of about 200
paddleballs dates to the '30s, and his binder of arcana includes photos
of kids playing paddleball next to presidents Eisenhower and Truman.</TE>
<TE>   "In a movie, if they want to show someone wasting time, it's the prime
example of moronic activity to have someone playing with a paddleball,"
says Volk, who cites Marilyn Monroe's paddleball routine in "The Misfits"
as the toy's prime cinematic appearance.  While the Nintendo era would
seem to have relegated the paddleball to the status of boomer nostalgia
item, Volk says the toy still sells about 5 million per year in the U.S.
For him, at least, the magic will never die. "I've been treated like
everything from a great artist to a pathetic freak," he says. "I don't
mind. I worked the Ohio State Fair last year and that was a lot of fun."</TE>

<TE>   And the act</TE>
<TE>   Falls the Shadow</TE>
<TE>   --T.S. Eliot, "The Hollow Men"</TE>
<TE>   On a bright and beautiful Los Angeles morning, with the skies blown
clear and early hints of spring in the air, I started south down Vermont
Avenue on a walk across the midsection of the city. Mine would be the
dawdling pace of a tourist. I'd put in only a mile or two each day,
gradually working my way from the now hip Los Feliz district to the heart
of South L.A., doubling back by bus at sundown.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way I would stop often to talk with people, and I'd
regularly retrace my steps from the day before to make sure I had not
overlooked anything of significance. Just what I was looking for I could
not say--scars and memories and signs of healing, I suppose, and also a
revelation or two about cities, how they hold themselves together, how
they sometimes fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   This was a walk that would cover a distance, not only of 10 miles, but
also 10 years. For five unnerving days in the spring of 1992, this same
stretch of Vermont had been a linear battleground, the main corridor of
the chaos that followed the acquittal of police officers in the beating
of Rodney King. The trouble had extended to all corners of metropolitan
Los Angeles, of course, from Long Beach to Pasadena, from Parker Center
to Frederick's of Hollywood, but Vermont, by far, got the worst of it.</TE>
<TE>   At least 128 buildings were reported damaged or destroyed along this
avenue, nearly twice as many as recorded on any other street. Vermont was
where the first of the riot's 54 victims fell--18-year-old Louis Watson,
struck by a bullet that at least some witnesses believed ricocheted off a
safe being pirated by looters. Vermont was where the large-scale looting
first broke out, at a "ten-dollar store" near where the street intersects
with Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   "Looting in progress over Manchester and Vermont," an LAPD helicopter
crew reported by radio that Wednesday, April 29, 1992, at 6:29 p.m., 15
minutes before a gravel truck driver named Reginald Denny would be
dragged  from his rig at Florence and Normandie and beaten. ". . .
Suspects running in  all directions."</TE>
<TE>   A quarter century earlier, the Watts riots had been contained mainly
within South Los Angeles--allowing Angelenos who lived beyond the burn
zone to regard the damage as a self-inflicted wound, something they had
done to themselves. This time it would be different.</TE>
<TE>   Within 24 hours, the rioting had crossed under the Santa Monica
Freeway, breaching a symbolic barrier, and spilled into mid-city
neighborhoods. There the arsonists and looters seemed to be motivated by
something other than outrage over police brutality and racial injustice.
There the point appeared to be to take what could be taken--tires,
Huggies, cleaning solvent, whatever--before this side door of unexpected
opportunity slammed shut. "A postmodern bread riot," social historian
Mike Davis called this northern front of the outburst.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont yielded some of the riot's most arresting images: young Korean
men crouched with pistols in firing positions as they peered out from
embattled shops; looters filing into overrun stores; an entire block of
commercial buildings aflame. Vermont also produced strange tales,
anecdotes gleaned from the shadows that fall between the idea of Los
Angeles--the next great world city, the shining capital of the Pacific
Rim--and the crasser reality of what it is capable of becoming, if only
for a few frenzied days and nights. Almost everybody I met on my walk had
a story to tell. From Ji Y. Suh, the general manager of Vermont Chevrolet
Buick, near 4th Street, came this one:</TE>
<TE>   Suh and his workers had defended the auto lot for three nights until
police  established a staging operation behind its fence. They went
without sleep, arming themselves with shotguns and pistols to hold back
the throng of several hundred rioters. Deterred, the mob redirected its
energy to opportunities across the street. An apartment house was set
ablaze. A tire store was picked clean--"down to the last tire and
screwdriver," Suh recalled. A hole was kicked in the bottom of the Jack
in the Box. It was what happened at the Jack in the Box that remains most
vividly with Suh.</TE>
<TE>   He saw whole families, elderly, couples, children, all queued up
outside, patiently waiting for a chance to wiggle through the hole and
into the fast-food franchise. These were not strangers, Suh said, but
people he might see any day meandering up and down the sidewalk, waiting
on a bus: "Plain Janes," he said, "normal people."</TE>
<TE>   At first they emerged with restaurant equipment, and after that with
food, hamburger patties, buns. With seemingly everything of value carried
away, the people still kept pouring through the hole. And in the end, Suh
said, "they were coming out with nothing but straws. Can you imagine?
That was all there was left to take. They were coming out with handfuls
of straws."</TE>
<TE>   My journey had been baptized in minor spectacle. Standing at the
corner of Vermont and Hollywood, I heard a horn blare, tires screech and
then a dull thud. I looked up to see a blue Ford van rocking on its
tires, green fluid draining from its underbelly. A maroon Mistsubishi was
planted in the van's right  side. This, it seemed clear, was another left
turn gone bad--a not atypical misadventure on the surface streets of Los
Angeles. In the days to follow, I would see left turns result in two
collisions and a half dozen finger-flipping, profanity-laced standoffs.</TE>
<TE>   As I headed away from this first collision--nobody appeared to be
seriously hurt--I considered the theme of left turns as a kind of riot in
miniature: Behind these commonplace impasses lurk frustration and
self-defeating anger and an instinct for anarchy, the same fuel that, on
a drastically larger scale, had fed the fires of a decade before.</TE>
<TE>   I toyed with this admittedly over-stretched metaphor to Santa Monica
Boulevard. At this corner a battle had been waged for control of a
Korean- owned electronics store, leaving one trespasser shot dead. A
check-cashing storefront had been overrun and destroyed. A Payless Shoe
Source outlet had  been torched.</TE>
<TE>   Now there was scant evidence of any of this. Here was a corner engaged
in the mundane, peaceful rituals of the everyday. Hair was being trimmed
at the Beauty Hair Center. The electronics store was now a huge and
bustling Staples. The Payless had been rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the shoe store register stood a short young man with
brushed-back hair and soft eyes. An American flag was pinned to his blue
work apron, along with a name tag that identified him as Isaac Castillo,
the assistant manager. He knew nothing about the fire and the gunfight.</TE>
<TE>   He had been 14 years old at the time; his mother, the protective type,
had kept him inside their apartment between Vermont and Oxford. His only
memories were fragmented images, strange men with shotguns passing by the
window, looters ducking inside a doorway across the street, "and that's
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Before closing my notebook, I decided on one last boilerplate
question: Do you think, I asked young Castillo, that Los Angeles was
changed much by the rioting? Are things any better now? With this lame
question, his face froze. He stared at me for a moment. "No," he said,
"it hasn't changed at all. It's still the same."</TE>
<TE>   Why do you say that?</TE>
<TE>   There was another pause.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother," he said finally, "was killed last month."</TE>
<TE>   He said this in a whisper, and I could barely make it out.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was killed," he repeated. "They shot her."</TE>
<TE>   Who shot her?</TE>
<TE>   "Probably it was gangs. The police haven't caught anybody yet. She was
driving a vegetable truck in Elysian Park. Three people got murdered that
same night. It was in the newspaper. They called her 'the Vegetable
Lady.' "</TE>
<TE>   I offered apologies. He shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "You see," he said, eyes burning through the tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Things haven't changed much, have they? It's still crazy. They are
still killing people."</TE>
<TE>   Along with a few pertinent books for coffee shop reading and a stack
of newspaper clippings from the riot coverage, I carried with me down
Vermont a list of addresses where rebuilding or significant repairs had
been required. This turned out to be excess baggage. The new strip malls,
gas stations, shoe and tire stores that had replaced the old were easy to
spot: They were the structures with cleaner and, sometimes it seemed,
thicker stucco walls. Many were outfitted with metal window coverings and
imposing iron fences. At a few stores, I noticed waist-high barriers
erected between the parking lot and building proper; whatever the actual
design purpose, it was not difficult to imagine these walls providing
cover for sentries wishing to repulse a mob. This fortress architecture
can be subtle: steel posts, painted a soft green, arrayed in a tight
picket line across a store at Vermont and 8th where, in 1992, looters had
gained entrance by ramming a pickup truck through the wall: Not the next
time, these posts declare.</TE>
<TE>   On the southeast corner of Vermont and Beverly, I walked past a
pawnshop, tripping an alarm that whooped like an ambulance siren. I
crossed through two doors of iron bars and introduced myself to the
owner, a Russian emigre named Vera Tenenbaum. A pleasant, albeit
cautious, woman, she stood on the other side of a plexiglass shield that
ran the length of the counter</TE>
<TE>   . I shouted questions at her through the barrier, and she answered in
a like manner. I imagine we caught about every other word.</TE>
<TE>   "Was this shop hit in the riot?" I hollered.</TE>
<TE>   "It was after the King trial, Rodney King" she answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, this business, though, did it get robbed?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, they steal everything."</TE>
<TE>   "Did they take any guns?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, everything gone. We had a flower shop next door, too. They take
everything."</TE>
<TE>   "So they took guns and flowers?"</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   Finally she slid open a little window. Communication improved.
Tenenbaum and her husband had emigrated from Russia in 1974. They bought
the pawnshop nine years later. The neighborhood, she said, had gone
downhill. Business was off. There was not much stock on the shelves: used
blue jeans, a few electric guitars, a tribal mask, a pair of shoulder
pads, and, inside locked glass cases, watches and jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the jewelry, she said, had been pawned 15 years ago by
customers: "They are scared to come into this area," she said, "because
it was robbed in the riot. That is why we stay here. We cannot take
property away and close the store. They sue us if we do. And they cannot
come and take it out, because they are too scared."</TE>
<TE>   She locked herself back inside her wall of plexiglass. I gave a nod to
the two security cameras and moved for the door. The alarm gave me one
last whoop as I headed down the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   To walk across Los Angeles can be an exhilarating experience.</TE>
<TE>   What might seem a modest day hike in the woods becomes, when conducted
on city sidewalks--cutting under freeways, crossing unmarked boundaries
into unfamiliar neighborhoods--an excursion. The eye catches details
missed from a car, graffiti sliced into the trunk of a palm tree, a
well-manicured garden squeezed behind ramshackle houses. At one point, I
passed under a ficus tree shimmering from the weight of unseen, but
wildly shrieking, birds. At another I stopped to watch a little girl in a
powder-blue sweatsuit and pigtails roll by on skates, licking an ice
cream cone. Her sweatshirt identified her as "Angel." Down the same
sidewalk less than a minute later trudged a bearded wanderer, shoeless,
skin burned by the sun, clothes plastered with grease and waste, leaving
in his wake a trail of stench that turned up noses at 50 paces.</TE>
<TE>   At a bus stop near Florence and Vermont, I was panhandled by a
toothless woman in an American flag T-shirt. She unleashed for my benefit
a wide-ranging discourse on abusive husbands, Beverly Hills housekeeping
and gunplay. With each new theme she demanded another dollar, and she
punctuated each demand with a stout punch to my shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   As I moved through the middle passages of my route, bisecting the
city's most heavily mixed neighborhoods, I started taking note of the
cacophony of signage: Filipino Chinese Delicatessan . . . Fiesta Grill .
. . Tom's Hamburgers . . . Horizon Church Ministries (Where Heaven and
Earth Meet) . . . City of Stars Collision Center . . . In Sung
Acupuncture . . . Rosa de Sharon Liberia Christiano . . . H.O.T. Thai . .
. Koryo Bakery . . . Italle Optometric Center . . . Makkah Meats . . .</TE>
<TE>   There was a poetry to these signs. They seemed so very much Los
Angeles. Before the riot, it had been popular, especially among L.A.'s
leaders, to celebrate this mix, to sing rhapsodies to the polyglot
wonders on display across the metropolis. The riot stopped the singing.
As a Times headline so neatly summarized at the time: "View of Model
Multiethnic City Vanishes in Smoke."</TE>
<TE>   While the composition of looters and arsonists was certainly diverse,
nobody found in this cause for celebration. There would be no fancy
phrase-making about diversity of dissent. A web of racial and ethnic
fault lines had been exposed. And in the aftermath came backlash. No
great feat of political genius was required to connect the dots between
the upheavals of 1992 and the subsequent campaigns to boot undocumented
immigrants from public schools and hospitals, to strip away affirmative
action, to reject bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   People I spoke with along Vermont tended to bring a certain bluntness
to discussions of racial matters. "Can I tell you what I saw?" began a
riot witness who identified himself as part Chinese, part Filipino.
"Where I was it was mostly Hispanic people causing the trouble, people
from Central America."</TE>
<TE>   A bank janitor, originally from Mexico, offered this: "Everything has
changed for the worse. This used to be a nice and quiet neighborhood. Now
so many people are coming here from everywhere, from all over the world;
they don't want to choose the American Way." And an immigrant from the
former Soviet Armenia complained: "The neighborhood has gotten worse
since the riot. The population has changed. Before it was mostly white
and Asian Pacific people. Now it is more Mexican and African American
people."</TE>
<TE>   Ji Suh, the 49-year-old general manager of the car lot, described how
the fury African Americans unleashed on Korean immigrants during the riot
changed him: "I lived here for 30 years, and for a long time I don't care
what others like or do. I work and I survive. I achieve my goal. I
thought that was enough. But that's not how it is is done here. This is
the United States of America. This is the melting pot. We have to reach
out to other communities. We have got to accept each other."</TE>
<TE>   He told of disputes over parking with Muslims who frequent a
neighboring Islamic center: "They have spit on my face. If it was before
the riot, I probably would punch them out. Now I deal with it
differently. I try to be more diplomatic." Such is post-riot progress in
the rainbow city.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody, it seems, received the news that the city's
multicultural magic vanished in the smoke of 1992. The stuff of myth can
still be found, tucked away in the most common of storefronts and strip
malls: At Vermont and 8th, one of the hardest-hit corners in the riots, I
stuck my head inside a sliver of a shop, Lucky Shoes and Toys. Half the
block had burned down in 1992. This store, luckily enough, was located in
the part that survived. Seated on a tiny chair in the back was a
Vietnamese woman dressed in a green blouse, blue, baggy slacks and red
sandals.</TE>
<TE>   Her name is Lien Trinh. She kept her arms folded across her chest as
she spoke. On that first night, Trinh and her husband had seen TV shots
of the fire and assumed all was lost. They drove by the next day and
found the shop had been spared. They were back in business two weeks
later.</TE>
<TE>   She excused herself to negotiate with a customer, an immigrant from
Central America.</TE>
<TE>   "Doce?" the customer asked, holding up a white pump.</TE>
<TE>   "Doce," Trinh said firmly. Twelve dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The other woman sighed.</TE>
<TE>   "Numero siete?"</TE>
<TE>   Trinh started digging through a pile of boxes on the floor for a size
7.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started," she said, "I don't speak Spanish. But I'm learning
from my customers."</TE>
<TE>   I asked her how she came to be selling shoes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a long story," Trinh said, "long story."</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband worked at U.S. military bases during the Vietnam
War. When Saigon fell, they found themselves routinely thrown to the end
of rice lines. "Oooh," she said. "Many headaches." So they were smuggled
out in a truck. They were locked into the cargo hold for two days and
nights; Trinh medicated her two toddlers to keep them quiet at the
checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   In Cambodia, smugglers counseled them to stash their gold inside the
soles of their sandals, a precaution against bandits. The next morning
the smugglers were gone. So were the sandals. The refugees set out for
Thailand on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We walked," she said. "Oooh, it was raining so hard. It's a long
story, you want to hear more?"</TE>
<TE>   Now the customer was waving the white pump, size 7.</TE>
<TE>   "Otro color?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Trinh said, "todo blanco."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, after many twists and turns, the family made it to the
United States. She found a job in a hospital; he worked at a swap meet.
Sixteen years ago they bought this little store on Vermont. The entire
family, the daughter and son who came over from Vietnam and the little
boy born in the States, worked selling shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "At first it was very slow," Trinh recalled. "Now it's a little more
better."</TE>
<TE>   I asked if her children still worked at the store. No, she said. Her
daughter is now a schoolteacher, a product of UC Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Her oldest son will graduate this spring from UC Davis, in
engineering.</TE>
<TE>   And her youngest? He is to enter UC Berkeley in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I told you," she said, her smile exposing a gold tooth, "it's a long
story."</TE>
<TE>   It would be known by many names. to Spanish-speaking Angelenos, it was
quemazones, the grand burning; to Korean immigrants, sa-i-ku, or April
29, in keeping with a Korean tradition of naming historic events by the
dates they occur. And now, crossing under under the Santa Monica Freeway,
I began to encounter people who considered the word "riot" offensive, or
at least off the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a riot," insisted a community activist I met at the
African American Community Unity Center on Vermont and 53rd. "It was
civil unrest."</TE>
<TE>   Others made reference to the "uprising" or "rebellion." The array of
semantical variations suggests that what happened 10 years ago was more
complicated than outrage over a single court case or a burst of wholesale
opportunism. In "Reading Rodney King/Reading Urban Uprising," an
anthology of riot-inspired reflections I took along on my walk, scholar
Cornel West argues that "what happened in Los Angeles . . . was neither a
race riot nor a class rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather, this monumental upheaval was a muti-racial, trans-class and
largely male display of justified social rage. For all its ugly,
xenophobic resentment, its air of adolescent carnival, and its downright
barbaric behavior, it signified the sense of powerlessness in American
society."</TE>
<TE>   From what I read, saw and remembered, I came to regard the rebellious
grand burnings of that April 29 and beyond as not one monumental
upheaval, but two. The twilight hours after the acquittals brought the
eruption of anger and frustration that everybody but the LAPD seemed to
know was inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lull the next morning, a Thursday, but in the afternoon
the burning and looting resumed. In this second round, as a compilation
of LAPD incident reports later would demonstrate, hot spots increasingly
flared up in sectors north of the Santa Monica Freeway: This would be the
riot of equal opportunity looting. By Friday the military troops began
moving into town, and the winding down was on.</TE>
<TE>   On this southern leg of my journey I heard for the first time mention
of "the Reginald Denny Four" and Latasha Harlins, the 15-year-old African
American shoplifter who had been shot dead by a Korean merchant in 1991.
The treatment of African Americans by the LAPD began to come up in every
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more police out walking around on the streets," suggested
41-year-old Nicholas Bryant. "If all you see is a guy in a car shining a
light in your face, you are not going to trust him. And he is not going
to trust you."</TE>
<TE>   The more people I met along Vermont the more I became cognizant of a
heretofore unnoticed phenomenon of the riot: Nobody seems to have taken
part in it. I did not talk to a single person who had anything to do with
any looting, burning or even spirited rabble-rousing. Yes, many of them
could provide fantastic, richly detailed accounts of the action--looters
frying themselves on jewelry store trip wires, shootouts between gang
members and shop owners, limbs severed in the stampede through a plate
glass window. As for themselves, well . . . .</TE>
<TE>   They had watched from "across the street."</TE>
<TE>   Or they had been "out and around" the riot, but not in it.</TE>
<TE>   Or they had been at home, "glued to the television."</TE>
<TE>   An uncommon number of Angelenos, judging by my informal survey, were
down in Orange County--"OC," as a panhandler at Vermont and 8th put
it--on the days and nights in question.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody, though, had been busy. Somebody, for instance, spirited away
132 pianos from Reed's Music,  a venerable Los Angeles establishment at
Vermont and 46th. For Jerome Bleeker, 80 years old at the time, this was
the second riot he would endure since buying the store after World War
II. In the Watts riots, he and his staff pushed a piano against the front
door to keep back the crowd; only one organ was lost.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992 the mob was more determined. Iron gates were twisted off
hinges, plate glass windows knocked out. Still, how so many
pianos--uprights, baby grands, every single one in stock except a grand
piano that apparently couldn't be squeezed through the doors--remains a
mystery of logistics.</TE>
<TE>   Later stories circulated of pianos sailing along Vermont Avenue on
dollies. Bleeker cannot confirm it: "I didn't stay around long enough to
see." Early that first evening, police had informed him the crowd was
moving north on Vermont: "We were warned they were pretty close, and we
were advised to get out."</TE>
<TE>   He returned the next day. Sheets of music were scattered about the
floor. The walls were covered with painted epithets. Strangers milled
about the store, picking through the ruins. Bleeker didn't attempt to
shoo them away; he just stood and watched, bewildered by the scene.</TE>
<TE>   His losses, however, were insured, and in time Bleeker was facing a
difficult question: "Do we take the money and run?" He talked it over
with his family and staff. They stayed. And now, a decade later, having
reached the age of 90, Bleeker has decided he might take a whirl at the
retirement life. The store is for sale, but attracting buyers has not
been easy.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'Oh, your business is in South Los Angeles. I don't want to
come down there.' " He tries to reassure them, insisting that "it's no
worse here in terms of hold-ups and break-ins and that sort of thing."
Nevertheless, this native of New Jersey, who came to Los Angeles as a
young man to play piano for the early cowboy movies, said he remains
optimistic--not only about selling the store, but about the city as a
whole. He has faith in the future. In the meantime, the iron gates that
failed in 1992 have been replaced by solid-metal shields that roll down
and lock tight.</TE>
<TE>   Do these work better?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah," he said without hesitation. "They're the best."</TE>
<TE>   It was late in the afternoon when I left Bleeker. Long shadows
stretched across Vermont. The bright skies at the advent of my walk had
yielded to a smoggy haze. As I was making a note to myself, I heard, yet
again, a squeal of tires. A car was spinning wildly in the street. In
another neighborhood, my first guess would have been movie shoot. This
seemed more ominous.</TE>
<TE>   The small station wagon came to a sideways halt in the middle of the
street, blocking another vehicle. All movement on the street stopped.
Other pedestrians drifted slowly into doorways and behind walls. I
followed their lead. At last a woman climbed out of the driver's side.
She was trembling. A passenger came around to console her.</TE>
<TE>   It was then I noticed, about 100 yards away in the crosswalk, the body
of  a brown-and-white dog. What had  happened seemed clear. This was  no
gangland showdown. Rather, the driver had swerved in an effort to  miss
the animal and lost control. Somewhat sheepishly, we all returned to  our
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I made my way to Beverly Blake's tidy white bungalow
on 53rd Street. I had gotten her name from newspaper clippings. In 1992
this single mother of three had joined neighbors to fight with garden
hoses a fire at their community center,  located on the corner in a
century-old brick church.</TE>
<TE>   She unlocked the front gate and let me in, pausing at the giant twin
palm trees in the front yard, each surrounded by flowers and ferns. Every
house in the neighborhood, she said, once had palms just like these--a
developer's touch from early 20th Century Los Angeles. Now only Blake
still had her trees.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, we sipped coffee and spoke of anarchy, fear and the racial
divide: "People can get to a point," Blake said, picking her words
carefully, "where there is an overwhelming desire to show the outside
community that we have been hurt far beyond any capacity we have to hold
it in . . . .</TE>
<TE>   "The European American has no idea of the psychological makeup of the
African American. The African American has absolutely no idea of the
psychological makeup of the European American. We relate to each other
through fear, and primarily fear of the unknown. It's like man and woman.
We live together and we don't know each other very well."</TE>
<TE>   I told her some of what I'd seen on my walk, the signboards, the
collisions of people from so many countries.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a polyglot city," Blake said. "However, I just don't think
anybody knows what to do with it. There is no precedent for what we've
become . . . . I think we have good intentions, but there is a difference
between the vision and the reality. We really don't know how to approach
this, do we?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe," she said after a pause, "maybe it will never be any
different. Maybe what happens in life is that we simply continue to try
and bring the different pieces together. We may never reach a bottom
line. It may never be a resolved. Maybe it's all a process."</TE>
<TE>   The city, never finished, exists in the striving?</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I think," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "And there will never be a perfect left-hand turn in Los Angeles?"</TE>
<TE>   "Never."</TE>
<TE>   "Looking for an address or something?"</TE>
<TE>   I had not seen this man, standing off the sidewalk, leaning against a
cinder-block wall. He had seen me--walking through a part of the city
where foot traffic in general, and 46-year-old white pedestrians in
particular, tend to be sparse. His name was Michael Cocquia. He was 33
years old, a custodian at a nearby school. He was dressed in a
khaki-colored shirt and trousers and black boots. His head was shaved. I
explained what I was up to, and he began to tell me about the riot.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just Rodney King," he said. "There were a whole lot of
brutality building up to it." Pointing as he spoke, he ran through a list
of neighborhood enterprises lost to fire, a swap meet, a market, a
shopping mall, none of them yet to be replaced. It was, he said, "like
you tore up where you live. And it didn't really come to no solution, no
conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, just as there were two riots, a case can be made that there
have been two recoveries as well, as post-riot studies have pointed out
again and again. Early in my walk, new strip malls marked the
battlegrounds. Once I crossed under the Santa Monica Freeway, however, I
started to notice a surprising number of weed-covered lots--graveyards of
structures lost in the riot.</TE>
<TE>   One such lot was home to a broken-down motorboat. Perched on a trailer
and plastered with graffiti, this forlorn vessel seemed a sardonic play
on that popular political axiom of the '92 presidential campaign, the one
about a rising tide lifting all boats.</TE>
<TE>   In the latter stretches, I would pass shopping centers guarded like
small fortresses, motels with no windows facing the street and vacant
fields where, right after the riot, plans for new supermarkets had been
announced--promises that later would be rescinded with not quite so much
fanfare as when they were made.</TE>
<TE>   There has been some rebuilding, of course. New Auto Zone and Payless
Shoes franchises sit on seemingly every other corner of Vermont. I
noticed a new Ralphs not far from USC--and noticed, as well, the
electronic security devices installed at every checkout counter.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, though, these last blocks seemed to mock the sentiments of
hope and resolve that gushed forth after  the riot, grand talk about the
trauma marking "the birth of L.A., as well  as the death of its
innocence," about the need going forward to "transform burnt-out
structures into the receptacles of our future."</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of promises made," more than one resident of South
Los Angeles reminded me. They tended to leave it at that.</TE>
<TE>   It already was dark when I boarded the bus at Vermont and Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   I was done walking. Now would come the ride back to the other end. The
 bus was crowded. Most of the passengers seemed weary. They rode in
silence while I peered out in the night through a filmy window, looking
for landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   There was the red brick community center that Beverly Blake had saved
and Bleeker's music store, its metal shutters slammed down for the night,
the sidewalks emptied. There was  the shoe store where Lien Trinh, mother
of three university students, was teaching herself Spanish, one zapato
at a time.</TE>
<TE>   There was the Jack in the Box, where looted paper straws had been
carried out like trophies in the fists of small children. And there was
the Payless where Isaac Castillo could be found most mornings behind the
counter,  quietly absorbing the loss of his mother, shot down in the
streets where she peddled bananas and artichokes.</TE>
<TE>   As the bus bounced along I remembered something Rodney King had said
in the heat of the riot. Not the overworked, and instantly ignored, line
about getting along. Something else: "We are all," he had said, "stuck
here for a while. Let's try to work it out."</TE>
<TE>   Academicians and journalists and social critics talk glibly of this
city advancing into a golden epoch, or  that city staggering toward
decline. They will convene at the anniversaries of colossal civic
moments,  of earthquakes, say, or riots, and measure "changes."</TE>
<TE>   The more difficult and less palatable truth is that cities don't work
that way. They gyrate in a million directions all at once, a collection
of people more or less stuck together, trying to work it out as best they
can.</TE>
<TE>   How was Los Angeles changed by the riot?</TE>
<TE>   My question to young Castillo had been as banal as they come, but I'm
convinced he got the answer right: It hasn't changed at all.</TE>
<TE>   Take away a new grocery store here, a weedy field there, and as far as
the city goes, the riot might as well not have happened at all--a
depressing thought, given its heavy toll in lost lives and looted dreams.</TE>
<TE>   seeking a brighter coda, i drove the next morning to a gaily painted
storefront just north of Manchester. A visual flower in an otherwise
bleak stretch of cityscape, this new deli was called Cafe Sweeties. It
had been closed when I walked by the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Inside I met Steven Brown, the 47-year-old owner. His riot story was
not atypical, but it also was not of the kind that lingers long in a
city's memory. It was not a tale of twisted mob violence. Brown simply
had helped his neighbors, Koreans who sold clothes from a small shop,
load their merchandise in a van and escape the coming fires. "They were
great people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Brown spoke, he sliced strawberries and honeydew melons and tossed
them into plastic bowls, creating fruit salads for the lunch crowd. His
theme was respect. This, he said, could be the riot's finest legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope we learned to respect each other is all," he said. "It's
the one thing we all want." Blacks, Koreans, police, everybody. "If we
can learn to respect them, and if they can learn to respect us, we'll be
all right."</TE>
<TE>   I went outside. Rain had fallen the night before, cleansing the air.
The midmorning sky was a deep blue, and the warm sun suggested not just a
hint of spring, but spring itself. I decided it was too fine a day to
waste. I left my car parked in front of Cafe Sweeties and started walking
up Vermont.</TE>

<DH>Sports-Marketing Visionaries Have Snatched the Professional Bowlers
Assn. From the Brink of Death. But Can the Old Pros of America's
Stodgiest Sport Handle the Coming of Cool?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDY MEISLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Jan. 20, 2002, a typically momentous day in the world of
American professional sports.</LD>
<LD>   In St. Louis, Rams quarterback Kurt Warner (seven-year, $46-million
contract) out-duels the Green Bay Packers' Brett Favre (10 years, $100
million) to help his team win its NFC playoff game 45-17. In Pittsburgh,
the Steelers wrap up their AFC division (total TV households: 18.9
million) by beating the Baltimore Ravens 27-10. At PGA West in La Quinta,
Phil Mickelson wins the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic and pockets a check for
$720,000.</LD>
<LD>   And, oh, yes: in Las Vegas, it's opening day of the annual Orleans
Casino Open, the 14th stop on the 2001-2002 Professional Bowlers Assn.
National Tour. This is competitive bowling at its highest level, and
during the next few days 142 of the world's finest bowlers will compete
fiercely for a first prize of $40,000.</LD>
<TE>   Before noon several hundred solid citizens--most carrying bowling
bags--enter the Orleans Hotel and Casino, a mid-range, Big Easy-themed
establishment about two miles off the Strip. They stride purposefully
through the cacophonous casino and take the escalator up to the hotel's
70-lane Bowling Center. A majority of them, as indicated by their ages
and happy shouts of recognition, are longtime league bowlers and
followers of the pro bowling tour. After paying their $129 entry fee,
they are now entered in the tournament's pro-am competition.</TE>
<TE>   Happy entrants get to share a lane with fireballer Jason Couch or
hot-blooded PBA scion Pete Weber or long-haired and leather-pantsed Danny
Wiseman or, perhaps, another of the tour's top contenders. All get a
certificate of participation and a free Fuze Raging Red bowling ball
(hole drilling at the pro shop: $25 extra).</TE>
<TE>   There is no mistaking this for, say, the pro-am at the Professional
Golfers' Assn.'s Nissan Open at Riviera (entry fee: $3,800). The amateur
bowlers, male and female, are dressed in everything from immaculate
bowling attire to jeans and T-shirts that say things such as "Cisco's
Party Zone" and "Inyo-Mono Concrete &amp; Construction Bishop California."
They refresh themselves with slushies and astoundingly large cups of
Pepsi from the snack bar and Bud Lights from the cocktail lounge. A light
haze of cigarette smoke drifts back to the shoe-rental counter.</TE>
<TE>   They also get one last glance, most likely, at a sweet, down-to-earth
and sadly archaic American institution.</TE>
<TE>   While the pros bowl dozens of games and head-to-head matches to cut
the field down to the mere five who will "make the show"-- i.e., appear
on the upcoming ESPN telecast of the tournament--most, including the
highest roller of all, current top dog Parker Bohn III, spend at least a
few hours at the Orleans mingling with the fans and signing autographs.
This quaint custom will likely end soon, because in a development only
dimly understood by most of those present, their favorite spectator sport
has been purchased--lock, stock and tournament schedule--by a trio of
semi-anonymous young businessmen whose intent is to revamp, "relaunch"
and propel pro bowling into the new millennium.</TE>
<TE>   This means fiddling with the rules to speed it up and make it more
palatable to modern television audiences; amping up the money and
pressure to make the sport more dramatic; establishing a viable star
system; giving said stars accessible "personalities" and enclosing them
in the same gleaming bubble of fame that encases the idols of "major"
sports.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to a very ambitious (some might say unrealistic)
plan, bowling will storm the airwaves, carve out a new niche in the
national consciousness and regain its rightful place alongside football,
baseball, basketball and hockey. The alternative--Plan B, if you will--is
oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   "I like bowling," says Chris Peters, a recreational bowler with a
respectable 160 per-game average. "I mean, it's OK. I mean, I like
bowling just like I like a lot of things. But I also like building
things."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: right now the thing that Chris Peters is busy building is
bowling's new order, and he is confident that as the sport's new
czar--he's chairman and one of the new owners of the Professional Bowlers
Assn.--he can turn it into something huge and exponentially more
valuable.</TE>
<TE>   This makes absolutely no sense until you realize that for the past
couple of decades, Peters, a self-described nerd, helped build Microsoft
Word and Microsoft Excel, both ubiquitous bulwarks of the Information
Age. As Microsoft employee No. 105, Peters joined Bill Gates' shop in
1981, rose to a vice presidency and left the company in 1998, at age 39,
with a fortune whose amount he'd rather not disclose.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there are other things he'd rather not disclose, including
any of his hobbies. ("I try, actually, not to get too much into my
personal life in publications and things," he says.) But he will admit
that he doesn't attend as many PBA tournaments as he'd like, what with a
year-old child and a strong aversion to taking anything more complicated
than direct flights from his home base near Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   What Peters is relatively eager to share is one of the more
interesting--and quirky--business stories of recent times; namely, how in
March 2000 he and two buddies decided to buy a 42-year-old entity that
not many people realized still existed, much less was available for
immediate purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sort of retired," says Peters, "I just wanted to do something
new, and I decided that I was going to start getting more physically fit,
which is not something I really was while sitting behind a desk for 16
years. So I wanted to learn a sport." Admitting that he was much better
at reading about sports than participating in them, Peters began perusing
the bowling periodicals that nestle in odd, barely visible corners at
most newsstands. "I learned about the PBA, started watching the TV shows
and learning who the pros were and all that kind of stuff. I heard that
they were sort of not doing that well, you know, from the magazines. You
kind of read between the lines."</TE>
<TE>   At that time the PBA was a nonprofit organization located in Akron,
Ohio, run by and for the bowlers themselves. Peters called, introduced
himself and offered to help out. Placed on the board of directors by the
slightly stunned then-PBA commissioner, Peters began offering advice. He
concluded that the only logical way the PBA could survive was for him and
two of his friends, fellow Microsoft alums Mike Slade and Rob Glaser, to
pony up $5 million of their own money and buy the PBA outright. The deal
was concluded in April 2000. Peters, Slade and Glaser--the latter two
don't give interviews--now compose the entire PBA board of directors. In
short order Peters and his partners moved the headquarters to Seattle,
nearer to Peters' home, and converted the PBA into a for-profit
organization.</TE>
<TE>   They also hired Steve Miller and Ian Hamilton--two high-powered and
high-priced former Nike marketing wizards--to handle the nuts and bolts
of executing their towering vision. Since then, he and his mostly silent
partners have pumped in another $10 million to $15 million of venture
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, there was an emotional aspect and then there was an
intellectual aspect," Peters says. "And it's not often that both can
happen, you know, at the same time. From an emotional point of view, it
just seemed terrible to have a [bowling] Hall of Fame and national
titles, and all the while people who are the best in the world at doing
what they [do are] selling insurance in Chicago. I mean, it just doesn't
seem logical that all that would happen."</TE>
<TE>   He adds, "From an intellectual point of view, they were getting great
ratings--their ratings were double that of hockey--with no marketing."</TE>
<TE>   As more proof of bowling's great potential, Peters says that when he
first arrived, the league's crude Web site was getting a "tremendous"
number of hits, about a quarter of them from bowling enthusiasts from
"wealthy, First World" countries such as Korea, Japan, Germany and
Sweden. "And again, from an intellectual point of view, the fact was that
you could buy an international league for less than the cost of a
Triple-A baseball team in a small town . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Financial opportunity, he implies, was knocking loudly enough to wake
the dead. "It just seemed crazy," he says. "You know what I mean?"</TE>
<TE>   These days, peters spends much of his time writing code for a
pay-per-Webcast feature of the revamped PBA Web site that will allow
online fans, for a projected fee of $9.95, to view the quarter- and
semifinal matches not shown on TV.</TE>
<TE>   If all of this seems a bit esoteric to players whose lives revolve
around subjects such as ball hardness, lane surfaces and the four- versus
five-step approach, nobody is complaining. Before Chris Peters &amp; Friends
arrived on the scene, pro bowling was a dying sport--and its survival
prospects were bleak at best.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of this is easy to see in Las Vegas. While the bowlers are
attired in spiffy shirts with their names written on their backs,
admission to the tournament is free to anyone who makes their way up from
the casino below. Throughout the preliminary rounds there are plenty of
empty seats on two small bleachers set up behind the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone interested in keeping up with the action can walk to the rental
counter to receive free pairing and score sheets as well as listings of
current local league openings and invitations to upcoming events such as
the Orleans Bowling Center Sweetheart Mixed Scotch Doubles Tourney.
Although the wall behind the pin spotters is festooned with the
establishment's funky Day-Glo Cajun alligator mascot, banners and signs
provided by sponsors and advertisers are scant.</TE>
<TE>   That things have retrogressed this far might seem surprising,
especially to Baby Boomers who have warm memories of watching weekly
network pro bowling broadcasts hosted by Chris Schenkel on Saturday
afternoons, just before ABC's "Wide World of Sports." Superstar
bowlers--among them Don Carter, Mark Roth, Dick Weber and Earl
Anthony--occupied a secure place in the nation's sports consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   But around the time that baseball, football and basketball fans began
to familiarize themselves with terms such as "free agency," "signing
bonus" and "lifetime endorsement deal," bowling--whose first prizes
rarely exceeded $25,000--began to sink into sporting obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   The villain, of course, was the evil god of demographics. In contrast
to golf, the sports success story of the '90s, bowling has always had a
blue-collar, Ralph Kramden image. It's mostly true, unkind though it may
be to admit. And although bowling's raw TV ratings were always viable,
its mostly couch-bound male viewers were more apt to buy Dr. Scholl's
corn plasters and Hagar slacks than Infinitis or Fidelity mutual funds.
In other words, the typical bowler was the kudzu of the upscale marketing
world.</TE>
<TE>   Low commercial fees begat lesser prize money, and as the newly minted
millionaires competing in other sports attracted more of our attention,
the weekly bowling show's ratings slipped from 9.1 in the mid-1970s to
2.0 in 1997. In that black year, research shows that 67% of its audience
was more than 50 years of age. ABC retired Schenkel and canceled its
bowling series after 36 years. Bowling on television became a
hit-and-miss affair, popping up haphazardly on network or cable
television via short-term contracts. Prize money began to drop;
long-running tournaments began to fall off the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Long before that, the print media had virtually abandoned bowling. A
search of periodical databases reveals that Sports Illustrated ran its
last bowling article of any length in 1990, the same year,
coincidentally, that the PBA tried to upgrade its image by banning its
athletes from smoking in the player bench areas. The Los Angeles Times'
last bowling beat writer, a 48-year veteran sportswriter named Don
Snyder, last had a byline in 1995. His Times obituary two years ago was
160 words long.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait a minute. my name was in the times," says eric forkel after a
Monday morning practice session. "I think it was in the early '90s,
somewhere around then."</TE>
<TE>   He smiles and shrugs. At 41, Forkel, who lives in Northridge, is a
21-year veteran of the pro bowling tour. He is a balding, outwardly calm
man who looks a bit like the actor Jeffrey Tambor ("The Larry Sanders
Show"), albeit 50 or 60 pounds lighter, and has won five tournaments, the
last in 1999, and exactly $827,315 in prize money in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider myself a good journeyman out here," he says. "I have had
some great moments, but there are certain guys out there who are just at
a different level and that's OK. Every sport has [its] superstars. I
don't mind being a really good bowler. I'd love to be a great bowler, but
you have to take what you can get.</TE>
<TE>   "Without sounding strange," says Forkel, "I was put on this earth to
bowl--whatever the hell that means."</TE>
<TE>   That means that during the 2002 season, Forkel, like many of his
competitors, drives from tournament to tournament. During the off-season
he helps a friend out in the pro shop at Rocket Lanes in Chatsworth. Like
many pros, Forkel earns extra income as a consultant/salesman for a
bowling ball manufacturer, in his case, a Utah-based firm called Storm.
He is married with two children; his wife works as a supervisor at a Vons
supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Forkel's first marriage broke up because, he says,
his wife objected to his spending so much time on the road. During the
1994 Northridge earthquake, he cut his foot on a shard of broken glass,
keeping him out of action for several months. In 2000, he fell through
his roof while trying to repair it and fractured his back. He won only
$12,060 last year, but thanks to strenuous rehab and practice he feels
back to about 80% of normal.</TE>
<TE>   Forkel isn't complaining and he's by no means the worst off of his
peers. Striking up conversations around the lanes elicits sadder stories:
of touring pros, by most definitions homeless, traveling the circuit in
small RVs with their wives while home schooling their children. There are
tales of good games gone inexplicably sour and players losing their
sponsorships and dropping off the tour to become car salesmen or join the
family plumbing business. There's talk of debilitating knee and shoulder
injuries--no team physicians or injured reserve in this league--and
scuffling during the off-season in local "amateur" tournaments with prize
pots averaging $25,000 or less.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of stress," says Forkel of the life he's chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Added to this is a certain melancholy: while he's an enthusiastic
supporter of the PBA's new management, Forkel realizes that, even if they
succeed immediately, at his age he probably won't be around more than
four or five seasons to cash in. He says he was born a little too soon
and, in another way, a little too late. "I've seen [films] of bowlers in
the 1960s, and I think my game would have fit right in then. I'm not a
real hard thrower. Just smooth and careful. Sort of right down the
middle."</TE>
<TE>   But this is not the 1960s. It's the dawn of a new era in professional
bowling. Much of the talk around the Las Vegas lanes is about the future,
including that of Steve Miller, the stocky, powerfully built president
and CEO of the Professional Bowlers Assn. He's talking forcefully about
possibilities in a quiet corner of the cocktail lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now," says Miller, "pro bowling is a third-tier sport. It's on
a tier with rodeo at the high end and tractor pulls at the low end. Where
I'd like to get to is a place where [the PBA] becomes the value of a top
National Hockey League team or a mid-level major league baseball team."</TE>
<TE>   A former track star and college sports administrator, the 58-year-old
Miller joined Nike in 1991, moved up to higher-paying jobs as the swoosh
conquered the sports world, and retired after the Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, as the company's director of global sports-marketing
relations. When the PBA's Chris Peters called, Miller admitted he knew
practically nothing about bowling. But he decided to take the job after
he noticed on an Italian vacation that the Prada store in Rome was
selling a line of chic, expensive bowling-style shoes and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we can reach a valuation of about $150 million," he says,
"which would give us an enormous return to our people and be a sum of
money that Americans--because this is where we live--can relate to. If
it's worth $10 million, it's the price of somebody's big house in
Bel-Air. If it's worth $100 million, now, it's real money."</TE>
<TE>   Miller adds: "Part of bowling's credibility gap was caused by playing
for $15,000 for first place instead of playing for $100,000. If I'm
channel surfing and I come across bass fishing at just the right moment,
and they're weighing the last fish to win $100,000, I'm going to watch
for that minute and a half. If they weigh it for $10,000, I'm flipping
[the channel]."</TE>
<TE>   Point made, he leans back. "Now, I don't think we're going to have a
year in the near future when these guys are going to make a million
dollars, but I believe we can get them up to $300,000, $400,000, $500,000
at the top end and $50,000 or $60,000 at the bottom." His first major
tasks, he says, were to define more clearly the PBA season as beginning
in September and ending in March (it used to trickle along all year);
more than double the prize money; sign a three-year contract with ESPN
(whether ESPN is paying the PBA or vice versa is a closely guarded
secret); tweak the tournament format to emphasize head-to-head matches
instead of pin total; and begin signing up as many sponsors and marketing
partners as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Miller appears prominently in a promotional DVD produced recently by
the PBA and distributed to potential sponsors. On it a narrator declares
that corporate naming and signage rights are for sale--everything from
the entire season to the shirts worn on television by the tournament
finalists to the lettering on the lanes, balls and bowling pins.</TE>
<TE>   At interview's end Miller is asked whether he'd recently uttered a
particular attention-getting quote--one attributed widely to him inside
the bowling world. "Yes, I did," he says. "I said that today everybody
says our bowlers are accessible, they're really wonderful guys, etcetera,
etcetera. But when the players all get agents, and they're all--" here he
uses a colorful but unprintable synonym for selfish egomaniacs "--we'll
know that w1697085029   Later, back in the cocktail lounge, Robert Smith,
a solidly built, fresh-faced 28-year-old from Simi Valley, ponders a
question about whether he'd like to become very, very rich. "Yeah, I
would," he says. "I think everyone here in this association deserves it.
To have the chance to be able to be among the elite athletes that are out
there, like Jordan and Tiger. It's just that we're in a sport that is
going to need a little help right now. And things are definitely turning
around the right way, I believe."</TE>
<TE>   A bowler since age 6 and a junior champion, Smith's high school
friends dissed him for playing "a sport for drunks and losers." But if
pro bowling catches on this time around, Smith--tabbed as a future
superstar by the league brass--has as good a chance to cash in as anyone.
A hard-throwing "cranker" nonpareil, his ball has been clocked at 34 mph,
the fastest on the tour. Last year he won two tournaments, and his ball
sponsor, Storm, sent him to Japan along with Pete Weber to hold bowling
clinics and play exhibition matches. "There were huge crowds," Smith
says. "I mean, there would be like 150 people bowling with us. But there
were only two of us, so we'd have to jump around the whole house, meeting
everyone. And there were probably about 300 people in the back watching,
so as soon as we were done [there was] a big old line waiting for us to
sign autographs."</TE>
<TE>   These days Smith drives a Honda Accord with 140,000 miles on it and
shares hotel rooms at tournaments with one or two fellow bowlers.
Recently, however, he starred in two 30-second spots in a series of PBA
promos currently running on ESPN. Titled "Spare Thoughts," the spots
supposedly open a window into the world of professional bowling and offer
scripted insights into the minds of the PBA pros. They're supposed to be
funny.</TE>
<TE>   In one "Spare Thought" spot, Smith is shown throwing a strike to win a
tournament. He pumps his fist in triumph, then bends down and sees
something on the lane apron. "Cool! A dime!" Smith says in a voice-over.
He picks up the coin and pockets it.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Miller's right-hand man, fellow Nike veteran Ian Hamilton, has a
plan to change all that. "We've got to dimensionalize the players. Create
stars. Build heroes and villains," says Hamilton, who will resign as the
PBA commissioner at the end of this season but will remain with the
league as a consultant and executive producer of the ESPN telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   At 44, Hamilton is a tall, thin, former junior tennis star who for 14
years was Nike's global director of tennis sports marketing. His proudest
accomplishment during that tenure, he says, was creating something called
the Nike Cup. For the Nike Cup, played in New York's Madison Square
Garden, Hamilton threw out the slow, old rules of tennis and had four top
players, all Nike clients, compete in 20-minute-long elimination
matches--one serve apiece, pingpong scoring, no linesmen.</TE>
<TE>   "So anyhow," he says, "I will never forget that night as long as I
live. I want to have that same moment in bowling, when I can walk into
the Garden--and the whole world will see the greatest bowlers in the
world compete in the greatest forum in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton concedes that his fantasy probably won't happen soon but says
that if the PBA's relaunching is on target, the tournament's final
matches will soon move out of bowling centers and into 10,000- or
15,000-seat arenas. The pro-am competitions also will take on a more
corporate flavor and entry fees may rise considerably north of $129.</TE>
<TE>   The majority opinion in the sports business world is that many of the
new PBA visionaries have as much chance of success as they might have to
convert a difficult split. The consensus is that, 1) bowling's
demographic woes still plague it; 2) most people think of bowling as
Saturday afternoon recreation, not a true sport; 3) in the new
Internet-and-multichannel universe, even "must see" sports are losing
money for their networks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hamilton spends most of his time tuning up the TV bowling
broadcasts--the "guttercam" is a recent innovation--and the bowlers'
public demeanor. Before each telecast Hamilton coaches the five bowlers
to remember that they're miked--boasts and challenges to their opponents
are strongly encouraged--and that the reason the man with the hand-held
camera is hovering around them is to catch that bead of sweat, and that
it would be really great to see it rolling down their foreheads. Hamilton
constantly encourages them to showcase their emotions--the right ones--on
the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, when we first got here," Hamilton says, shaking his head,
"these guys, when their opponents bowled a strike, they'd actually give
them a high five! I said: 'Guys, do you think Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi, when they change sides in the middle of the game, do you think
Pete says, 'Hey, nice return,' and Andre says, 'Yeah, great serve'? Are
you kidding me? They keep their heads down and don't say a word and don't
even give the other guy an inch. That is competition. And you guys better
be that competitive because there is a title at stake and there is a lot
of money at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't thinking about it that way. So, you know, while I'm not
saying this is the WWF [World Wrestling Federation], I am saying, 'Guys,
don't forget: Sports is entertainment.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, over the next four days sports and entertainment of the
Darwinian kind--"terminal competition," as Hamilton calls it--are in
plentiful supply in Las Vegas. On Monday morning the 142 pros are divided
into two flights and each competitor bowls nine games. After their pin
totals are added up, the top 64 move on to the next round. On Tuesday
morning the survivors bowl nine more games, with their totals from Monday
carried over. The field is cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   Both Eric Forkel, averaging 228 of a possible 300, and Robert Smith,
averaging 226, make it to the single-elimination phase. At noon on
Tuesday, Forkel shakes hands with Joe Ciccone, a 26-year-old from
Buffalo, N.Y., and begins their best-three-out-of-five match. Forkel
starts slowly, losing the first game 213-196, but then finds his groove
and sees his medium-pace hook yield strikes. Ciccone has the curious
habit of staring blankly at the side wall of the bowling center and
taking long walks away from the lanes while his opponent is bowling. It
doesn't work. Forkel wins the next three games and advances to the round
of 16 finalists.</TE>
<TE>   At 2 p.m. Smith cranks up against Amleto Monacelli, a dangerous
18-time tournament winner from Venezuela and one of the few foreigners on
the tour. From the first frame it's obvious that Smith's fastball is
missing the strike zone: he has several hot streaks, but instead of
producing thunderous strikes, he leaves a series of disappointing spares
and improbable splits. Smith loses the match. He wins $2,250--a little
more than twice the amount he figures will cover his week's expenses.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday at noon Forkel faces off against Ricky Ward, a dangerous
33-year-old left-handed semi-cranker from Florida and former rookie of
the year. Forkel loses the first game 227-225 but beats Ward in the next
two, shouting, "Carry!" as his balls head unerringly into the pins. He
controls the fourth game up to the 10th frame, and all he has to do is
score a strike or spare to win the game and the match.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, he throws a difficult 6-8-10 split and fails to get the spare.
He loses that game and the final two in quick succession. He exits the
tournament with a grand total of $3,500. Forkel returns to his hotel room
to cool down, then comes back 45 minutes later, subdued but surprisingly
composed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just tense, tight," he says of his fatal throw. "I put a little
extra on the ball. I shouldn't have done it. I've had trouble with that
in the past, getting past that pressure point. I've maybe lost five
tournaments in my career that way. That's the one moment when everything
is in the balance. The new owners love that concept. That's what they
think bowling ought to be. Well, I guess they're right. I just have to
confront it."</TE>
<TE>   If you are from one of the 574,799 households that tuned in to the
taped ESPN telecast that Sunday in January--a pitiful fraction of the TV
bowling audience at its height--you know what happened next. The
televised portion consists of four single-game eliminations; the
championship match was between Ward and Brian Voss, a slim, good-looking
43-year-old fading star who had won 20 tournaments but none since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Voss played his TV role perfectly, pumping his fist, yelling at his
balls to behave, shaking his head in disgust and talking to himself on
the bench while his opponent bowled. These moments received much instant
replay. In the ninth frame Ward missed an easy 4-7 spare--a little poetic
justice for Forkel--to hand the championship to his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd almost forgotten what it felt like to win," Voss says after the
match. Two local newspaper reporters take down his words. They will
appear in two small articles the following day.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes: Ian Hamilton wants to apologize because the PBA's flashy new
set--including heavy metal trusses holding 51-inch plasma screens
enabling spectators to watch the same moments they're looking at
live--isn't present at the Orleans. Unfortunately, the bowling center
floor isn't strong enough to support it.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking forward," Hamilton says quietly, "we may have to go to a new
venue. Or even a different city."</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's eyes flash. Directly in his line of sight sits a happy
crowd of bowling-mad retirees and blue-collar workers. In his mind's eye,
though, perhaps he is in Madison Square Garden or Staples Center or
Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland. Parker Bohn versus Pete Weber in
the final match of the $1-million ABC "Monday Night Bowling
Championship." Five frames for all the marbles. Spike Lee and Mike
Wallace in their $150 lane-side seats. And there, high above it all,
giant beads of sweat on the JumboTron. Postscript: On Feb. 10, the ESPN
audience for pro bowling topped 1 million households for the first time
this season. On Feb. 17, Robert Smith won the PBA Empire State Open at
Latham, N.Y., near Albany.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>The Art and Science of the Elite Bowler</TE>
<TE>   Despite their unearned reputation as the only overweight, overaged
white guys in professional sports--David Wells, Craig Stadler, Tony
Siragusa, anyone?--pro bowlers are, for the most part, elite athletes.
Though approximately the height and weight of normal human beings, they
walk among the estimated 3.5 million sanctioned league bowlers as gods. A
pro bowler flings a 15- or 16-pound ball toward a precise spot 60 feet
away thousands of times in competition--tens of thousands in
practice--each year. The approach and delivery must be practiced,
analyzed and changed as subtly and as often as any professional golfer's
swing. Speed, balance and accuracy are constantly juggled: slow- and
moderate-throwing bowlers trade control for striking power; hard-throwing
"crankers" employ dramatic backswings that end two or three feet above
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   As the pros stride toward the foul line they try to dance themselves
into the perfect position to apply the perfect amount of spin to their
(hopefully) perfectly balanced ball. Then they hope for enough pure luck
to achieve sufficient pin "carry" for strikes and avoid spare-leaving
"wraps," "taps" and, worst of all, unmakeable splits in which the
remaining pins are so far apart that they're nearly impossible to knock
down with the bowler's final ball.</TE>
<TE>   Lastly--and infuriatingly frustrating to anyone trying to explain the
intricacies of the pro game--is that bowling lanes are cleaned daily,
then covered with a sheet of transparent oil. Spinning bowling balls skid
straight ahead on heavily oiled areas and grip, then hook, on lightly
oiled or unoiled patches, which is why recreational lanes are oiled with
a higher concentration in the middle. That creates a funnel effect that
guides hooking balls into the pocket--the sweet spot between the head pin
and its left or right companion. In PBA tournaments, the lanes are oiled
evenly and smoothly from the foul line to approximately two-thirds down
the lane, with devilishly different minor variations each week. The
bowler must "read" his lane to guess exactly where his spinning ball will
start to hook--even as lane conditions change over the course of a game,
because each thrown ball absorbs excess oil and lays a new oil patch
farther down the lane.</TE>
<TE>   To complicate matters, left-handers and right-handers face completely
different conditions, and in qualifying rounds bowlers move left to right
from one pair of lanes to another, facing new conditions each game. The
best way to describe it is that bowling and golf have much in common,
nerves included, except that in bowling the equivalents of sand traps and
water hazards are invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Once this abstract concept is grasped, pro bowlers believe, fandom
will follow.</TE>

<HD>15 More Minutes: Checking In on Joel Wachs</HD>
<DH>The Longtime L.A. City Councilman is Ebullient About His Job in New
York as President of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. He
Doesn't Miss Politics, but He Does Yearn for L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC PAPE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Wachs looks peppy for a man of 63 as he stands on 7th Avenue
across the street from the Manhattan hotel he called home for six months.
Sliding into a restaurant booth for breakfast, he's beaming. It's not
exactly what you might expect of someone who moved to New York last year
in defeat, walking away from three decades of public service in Los
Angeles after losing his third race for mayor.</LD>
<LD>   "For 30 years of my life, I had to ask for money, which is the most
horrible side of politics, and now I give it away," he says.</LD>
<LD>   The money he's doling out is from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the
Visual Arts, which supports artists. Wachs is president and CEO of the
foundation. "We don't have to deal with politicians or anyone." After
toiling on L.A.'s City Council for so long, Wachs understands the meaning
of such freedom better than most. Perhaps that is why, even in this glum,
aging cafe with its faded interior and sinking booths, he is funnier,
freer and more engaged than I ever expected.</LD>
<TE>   Could this effervescent guy possibly be the same man so humbled a year
ago?</TE>
<TE>   The answer comes as I watch him meticulously cut his French toast into
small pieces before taking the first bite. Yeah, it's the same Joel
Wachs.</TE>
<TE>   So, how's things?</TE>
<TE>   "I am pinching myself, asking myself, 'Can this be real?' "</TE>
<TE>   It is no small feat to escape decades on the City Council with your
faculties intact, but Wachs' view isn't focused on the past. "That
chapter is just closed. I am proud of my legacy, but I don't look back."
With finality, he adds, "I have no desire to ever run for office again."</TE>
<TE>   OK, but why New York?</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to get another 15 minutes," he says with a smirk.</TE>
<TE>   Before meeting Wachs, I had a hard time envisioning him amid the
high-rises of midtown. We're talking about the perennial representative
of Council District 2, the rising young Republican from the San Fernando
Valley back when I was learning to walk. Orange groves still thrived in
the Valley at the time of Wachs' first election. He seemed more secure in
his job than a college professor. It wasn't hard to imagine him being
carried out on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   After crushing opponents election after election--eight in all--he set
his gaze on the mayor's office. He ran in 1973. He lost. He tried again
in 1993, while serving as council president. He lost again, this time to
political novice Richard Riordan. Wachs reached for the grail one last
time in 2001, running not as the populist Riordan had defeated. This time
he finished a disappointing fourth, with 11% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "There were six major candidates and only one was going to win," he
says. "I'm a big boy. I can handle it."</TE>
<TE>   One would have thought he'd begin to wind down. Not so. "A lot of
people start setting their eyes toward retirement as opposed to a new
career. I didn't really think about that. I just thought, 'What am I
gonna do next?' " He was a well-known supporter of the arts, both as a
council member and in private life, regularly spending one-quarter of his
salary on art. As a member of the Andy Warhol Foundation board of
directors, he also knew that its director had retired--but he had given
the vacancy no thought. After all, the job was in New York, not L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Then, unexpectedly, another board member asked Wachs whether he would
take the job. "As disappointing as it was to lose the race, that this
came along 48 hours later was amazing. It was like winning a lottery: Do
what you love, in the legacy of Andy Warhol, and be well paid--it's a
dream job!"</TE>
<TE>   Wachs' interest in Warhol dates to the 1960s, when he discovered the
artist as a trailblazer for personal liberation. Still, Wachs had doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "When you visit New York, you say, 'This is great for, like, four
days. But would I live here?' That is what I thought." Nonetheless, he
signed a four-year contract, and then was surprised by the response in
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of people who I didn't even know wrote. They were in their
60s and they said, 'It is great to know that it is still possible.' I
gather that it is hard to apply for jobs at 62."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't expect that his new life choice might inspire his peers. "I
just want to live every day of my life in a rewarding and exciting way,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   As he rambles on excitedly in Manhattan-speed sentences, it is clear
that he is succeeding. Day to day, he administers a $150-million
foundation with 22 employees, as well as the Andy Warhol Museum in
Pittsburgh. The foundation last year gave out between $5 million and $6
million in grants to arts organizations, some of which are having a
harder time obtaining funding under a socially conservative National
Endowment for the Arts. (Friends of Wachs have long suggested that he
might one day head the NEA.)</TE>
<TE>   In his new post, Wachs hopes to give controversial artists financial
shelter from politicians who seize on issues such as sex or race in art
for political gain. He especially enjoys working with bright young
artists around the country. "Many people, when they get older, think that
the world has gone to hell in a hand-basket. But I am really inspired by
the young."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, created out of Warhol's one-sentence will, which said,
"It all goes to the visual arts," is the largest supporter of
cutting-edge art in the United States, Wachs says. "If I could do one
thing, it would be to broaden the appreciation for the arts in this
country so that people would realize how important the arts are and how
we are blessed in Los Angeles and New York by our wealth of artists. We
must support them." While Wachs says that little could surprise him in
New York now, that wasn't necessarily the case when he arrived in late
summer for his first scouting visit. He was shaving in his hotel room on
the cloudless morning of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   He made it back to L.A. after three days of canceled flights. "I was
so glad when I got home," he recalls. But he adds that being in New York
helped him bond with the city. "I am glad that I was here for it. And I
was glad upon my return that people in Los Angeles took it very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, on Sept. 28, Wachs formally relinquished his City
Council seat, two years early. The next day, he flew back to New York, a
city in the midst of anthrax scares, nasty flashbacks and repeated
evacuations of buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a scary flight back. I was giving up a council seat, changing
cities, changing lives. It was a strange beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Decades earlier he had sacrificed a lucrative tax law career for
public life. Now he was walking away from his platform of advocacy for
neighborhood councils, for the rights of people infected with AIDS and
HIV, for the rights of the elderly and from his battle against government
waste.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he says, his only political activities will involve the arts. He
didn't vote in New York city's mayoral race last fall, and he hasn't even
registered to vote here.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's like I want to keep living, and this is a wonderful way
to do it. It is a way to make the later years every bit as fun and
rewarding as the earlier years. If the first months are any indication,
this is it. I have the same enthusiasm and energy I did during my first
months on the City Council. It is much better than sitting on your
laurels."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of another L.A. figure who had started a new career late in
life: "Dick Riordan, who was around 63 when he became mayor. He went the
other way, from private life into politics. I recommend it to people. I
really do."</TE>
<TE>   As for Los Angeles, he has promised his mother that he will visit each
month. "I think L.A. has just begun to reach its potential. It is a city
of the future. It is blessed with a great physical environment. I love
L.A. If I were back there tomorrow, I'd be a happy camper."</TE>

<DH>Angles and Arcs Take Shape in an Unconventional Master Bedroom
Suite</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Sandy and Barry Pressman got married 10 years ago, she sold
her home and moved in with him. His two-story contemporary house, her
Abstract Expressionist art--that was the arrangement until the Pacific
Palisades couple decided to create a space they could call theirs.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, they wanted an airy bedroom with an ocean view, a
bathroom large enough for both of them, a comfortable place to read
and--why not?--his-and-hers walk-in closets. It took time to work out the
structural details, but this past fall architect Todd Conversano finished
fitting everything on the Pressmans' wish list into a boldly
unconventional master bedroom suite that's part space capsule, part
luxury cocoon.</LD>
<LD>   A young Los Angeles designer with an eclectic streak--"I generate
forms from different references," he says--Conversano has drawn
inspiration from sources ranging from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Pit and the
Pendulum" to the work of his former professor and boss, Eric Owen Moss.
But at the heart of his vision was his own fascination with flat planes
and curved volumes. "The circle was an organizing element for the
bedroom, a way to define the sleeping space. Though I'd been thinking
about cones for a long time, the truncated conical piece came later," he
explains. "I played with the shapes on the computer to make sure we could
get a bed in there. After that, it was just working out the details."</LD>
<TE>   Outside, Conversano clad the second-floor addition in sheet-metal
shingles and rough-textured stucco as both contrast and complement to the
rest of the building. "I didn't want it to look entirely foreign," he
says. The shingles reappear indoors at the entrance to the bedroom, just
one of several instances where materials are repeated for visual and
tactile continuity.</TE>
<TE>   Playing off the stucco, smooth-troweled gray plaster highlights the
intersection of elliptical and square walls around the bed. Aluminum
shelves store books in the mini-library, magazines under the nightstands
and snow globes above the towel racks. Stained birch paneling sheathes an
angled wall behind the television and a long corridor leading to the
closets and dressing area. While the balcony rail traces the arc of the
bedroom's circumference, Conversano punctured curved walls with windows
and double doors to expose and accentuate the structure's mass and
transparency. "The light and shadows are beautiful," Sandy says. "There's
a  Mayten tree that's become an integral part of our bedroom. It's like a
curtain so we don't need to drape the room." For the bathroom, Conversano
placed basins on the diagonal in the soapstone-topped island, then
suspended medicine cabinets from the ceiling so the Pressmans can see and
talk to each other as they prepare for the day. Limestone tiles laid out
in an uninterrupted brick pattern span the width of the room, from shower
enclosure to open tub. Skylights and clerestory windows invite sun and

<HD>California Steamin'</HD>
<DH>Producing Fine Sake Is Becoming a West Coast Industry</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL BARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfitted with a hairnet and surgical/comical plastic shoe covers,
I enter the koji room at the Takara sake brewery in Berkeley. The air is
steamy and pungent, and it's clear that mold has infested the entire 2.5
tons of rice that sit in a circular tank. This is good, explains Teisuke
Kainuma, president of Takara USA. The spread of koji fungus is a fragile
and crucial step of sake production.</LD>
<LD>   Sake dates back as far as 4,800 BC in China, and to about AD 300 in
Japan, where it has been raised to the level of art. And though machines
have replaced most of the human laborers, the fundamental flowchart has
changed little over time. Rice kernels are milled and polished, washed,
soaked and steamed. Then comes an intricate blending of cooked rice,
koji, water and active yeast. The resulting "main mash" is pressed after
20 days, with the liquid sake proceeding to further steps of settling,
filtration, pasteurization and aging for three to four months in tanks.</LD>
<TE>   More and more, this is a process that occurs in California. Ozeki
opened the first mainland sake facility in Hollister in 1979. It was
followed by Takara and Kohnan (under the name Hakusan) in Napa, and
Gekkeikan in Folsom. All four are subsidiaries of Japanese companies that
gravitated to California because it satisfies the three prerequisites of
sake production: proper temperature fluctuations, pure water and, most
important, viable rice cultivation. The japonica rice grown in the
Sacramento Valley might not offer the microregional distinctions that
characterize grains grown in Japan, but it is uniformly suitable for sake
production.</TE>
<TE>   As America gets acquainted with sake, a couple of long-held myths are
going belly-up. One identifies sake as rice wine. Though it has the
subtle balance associated with white wine (and an alcohol content,
15-16%, that's pretty close), they are not one and the same. Nor is sake
a type of beer. Sake's "multi-parallel fermentation"--koji converts
starch to sugar while the yeast converts sugar to alcohol-- makes it
unique. Like beer, however, sake is not meant to age in the bottle and
should be refrigerated after opening.</TE>
<TE>   The second enduring myth is that sake offers all the sensory delights
of nail polish remover. This idea germinated in the decades when most
Americans had access only to Japan's  low-quality exports. Sipped hot,
there was little chance that you might actually taste them.</TE>
<TE>   Sake comes in a multitude of guises and quality levels, including
ultra-premium. The California breweries offer light sakes, dry sakes,
"draft" sakes, unfiltered sakes and organic sakes, not to mention a
variety of plum sakes (pleasant with dessert) and mirins (the Japanese
answer to cooking sherry).</TE>
<TE>   Sake also happens to be one of the four pillar ingredients of Japanese
cuisine--along with dashi stock, soy sauce and miso. Beyond its own
flavoring, it is believed to tenderize food and suppress saltiness. In
Los Angeles' Little Tokyo, the New Otani Hotel applies sake to everything
from sukiyaki to simmered mackerel with radish. With such culinary
versatility, it can't be long before California sake becomes a trusted
institution--as American as rock 'n' roll, apple pie and Kazuhisa Ishii
pitching to Ichiro Suzuki.</TE>

<HD>The Next Big Thing?</HD>
<DH>The Creators of Sushi Roku Are Betting That It's Robatayaki</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year restaurant trendcasters try to fathom what the next big
hit will be, hoping to predict this season's equivalent to Nuevo Latino,
tall communal tables a la Philippe Starck, or revolting flavored
martinis.</LD>
<LD>   The team behind the trio of Sushi Roku restaurants seems to know just
what the young urban middle class with pretensions to hip will go for.
Opened by a couple of alumni from Matsuhisa and just blocks away from the
influential Japanese seafood restaurant, Sushi Roku borrowed ideas from
Matsuhisa, brought their new-style sushi dishes in at lower prices and
produced it for a crowd. Most important, owner Michael Cardenas and
partners set Sushi Roku in a hyper-stylish framework of river rock,
boulders and hand-hewn wood. He also made a full bar an integral part of
the equation, giving the people in black a place to look beautiful and
nibble rather than commit to a full meal.</LD>
<LD>   The concept has been so successful, one Sushi Roku has become three.
The fact that the sushi is not particularly good doesn't seem to bother
its fans. Next, Cardenas and his partners took on the steakhouse with
their Balboa restaurant inside the Grafton on Sunset hotel, retooling the
concept to appeal to presumably the same crowd. As with the Sushi Rokus,
the edgy design of the restaurant is a key component.</LD>
<TE>   Now with Katana, their latest restaurant, Cardenas and company have
put their bet on robatayaki as the next big thing. Basically, it's
slender bamboo skewers of meats, vegetables and seafood grilled over
Japanese hardwood charcoal. If this were a movie concept, it would be the
perfect pitch for the restless urban young: exotic, but not too much so,
food you can nibble on, and the lure of something new to master--sake.
Not just any sake, but artisanal sake from small producers in the
Japanese countryside. The list of 40-plus sakes by the bottle ranges in
price from $37 to $165.</TE>
<TE>   Like Sushi Roku and Balboa, Katana stars because of its looks. The
landmark building, just across the Sunset Strip from Balboa, is 1920s
Spanish in style and, incidentally, headquarters for Miramax Films. It
boasts a gorgeous--and that's the only word for it--terrace a flight of
steps up from the street, one that looks on the action below and is a
great place for a drink at dusk.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, we leave Spain and the '20s for a restaurant designed by Dodd
Mitchell that feels like a "Mad Max" set that's had some feng shui done.
The walls of the angular concrete bar are covered in railroad spikes.
Under light as dim as in a cave, hostesses will lead you back, past a
wall of textured rock, to the dining room constructed of pierced and
gouged metal and lined with tatami-covered banquettes.</TE>
<TE>   The noise is deafening, more so as the half dozen sushi chefs and the
entire serving staff shout out a greeting that makes newcomers cringe.
Next to the sushi bar is the robata bar with the various skewered choices
laid out in a case. Behind, the cooks with black kerchiefs tied around
their heads tend the charcoal coals in a cloud of steam and vapors.
Around the room, diners murmur urgently into their cell-phone mikes, no
doubt reporting the scene to their listeners.</TE>
<TE>   It is quite a scene. A floppy-haired fashion critic in  a monkey fur
vest shoots around the corner, his posse of fashionistas close behind.
Waiters rush plates of sizzling skewers to the table, and sushi chefs
decorate platters of clumsy sushi rolls with bright red lobster shells.
Behind me, a young man blithely orders a $75 bottle of sake. It's one of
the few L.A. places that has a real New York vibe, says a New Yorker
friend.   And the food? Well, the less said the better. Start with an
order of edamame. The boiled soybean pods come hot and nicely salted, the
better to take the edge off your hunger while you try to make some sense
of the menu. For drinks, there's the daunting list of sakes, divided into
three or four general categories, but without further explanation. I
suspect people order by price, as they do when they don't know wine.</TE>
<TE>   Though Katana had been touted as having its own sake sommelier and a
cart of premium sakes, neither was in evidence on any of my three visits.
My waiter one night steered me toward a lower-range $45 bottle, which he
claimed is served in Japan Airlines' first-class cabin. Whatever. It was
a pleasantly complex rice wine, kept cool in a bamboo box filled with
ice. For those who don't like sake, they also serve  Japanese beers and a
delicious, full-bodied Red Sun ale on tap.</TE>
<TE>   To make things simple, you could order one of the three robata
combinations, but if you choose yourself from the more than two dozen
offered, you'll get a more interesting selection. The sets tend to offer
chicken, chicken and more chicken--wings, tenders, chicken with green
onions, little chicken meatballs--none of which have much taste.  That's
why you'll need the trio of dipping sauces provided: a ponzu, a
sesame-mustard and a light ginger. The latter is for the vegetables,
which include cherry tomatoes wrapped in pancetta, flaccid shiitake
mushroom caps (it's hard to believe they could find shiitake this
flavorless), grilled asparagus, or roasted elephant garlic. The garlic
must be terribly popular, because it was sold out on two occasions. The
prime rib is innocuous, the chicken gizzard is gristly, and the fish is
nothing special. It's evident the cooks aren't working with top-grade
materials.</TE>
<TE>   The sushi is, if anything, worse. No matter what you order, it all
tastes the same. The seafood's dull cast is a giveaway that it's not very
high quality. I wouldn't suggest sitting at the sushi bar unless you
enjoy watching sushi chefs squirt various sauces and spicy mayonnaise
onto your fish. After sitting there one night, I'd say sushi rolls far
outrun nigiri-sushi in popularity here. Salmon skin, spicy tuna and
soft-shell crab are mediocre. Best is the ume roll stuffed with dried
sour plum paste and bonito flakes. But what most disappoints is the
quality of the rice.</TE>
<TE>   One night our waiter tells us about a special of conch with ginko nuts
and mushrooms and a cake of grated lotus root wrapped in a thin membrane
of tofu skin in a rich broth. When you break into the flat cake, the
starchy, delicious lotus root falls into the broth to create a
wonderfully rich soup.</TE>
<TE>   Servers do a good job of explaining the menu and its various
categories and items. No matter how busy Katana is, they're friendly and
helpful. The professionalism of the front of the house is Katana's
strongest suit.</TE>
<TE>   My advice would be to order carefully, just enough to sustain you
while you take in the entertaining scene. Even so, you might be surprised
how much those inexpensive-sounding little dishes can add up. When you
rise to leave, the assembled cast and crew shout out a goodbye that
echoes all the way to the door. Just another night on the Strip.</TE>

<HD>Chicago's Gem of a Cop Opts for the Real Jewels</HD>
<DH>Law: Legendary career provided fodder for Hollywood, grist for the
rumor mill, target for the FBI.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON COHEN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>The jewelry salesman was ready for the thieves this time. He set
out on a trip with $58,000 in luxury watches in the trunk of his Lincoln.
He wanted to be followed.</LD>
<LD>   From his suburban Chicago home, he headed into Indiana as two cars--a
Buick Century and an Olds Cutlass--trailed him for 50 miles, all the way
to the parking lot of a place called the Spa restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   When the salesman went inside, one of the thieves pounced--opening the
trunk of the Lincoln with a key and lifting out two jewelry cases. Then
he sped away.</LD>
<TE>   This wasn't the first time the salesman had been targeted. Twelve
years earlier, $310,000 in Baume &amp; Mercier watches were snatched from his
car--by some of the same thieves watching him this day.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, the salesman was the bait. FBI agents in a van were
videotaping the scene. And those watches lifted from the trunk? They were
provided by the feds.</TE>
<TE>   Among the thieves in Porter, Ind., that October day in 1996 was a
lookout, a silver-haired man with an extraordinary resume for a criminal:
He once was a deputy superintendent of the Chicago police.</TE>
<TE>   As a cop, he had worked closely with the FBI, piling up commendations,
including one from J. Edgar Hoover. He had such a legendary police career
that Hollywood modeled a hard-boiled TV character after him.</TE>
<TE>   But on this day, William Hanhardt was doing something far different:</TE>
<TE>   He was running a multimillion-dollar jewel theft ring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when Hanhardt was known as a cop's cop.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the 1960s, an era when plainclothes police wore porkpie hats
and reed-thin ties, that he began making his mark.</TE>
<TE>   He once chased a vicious ring of home invaders down the street, his
bravado making a front-page splash. A newspaper photo shows the young cop
proudly holding a tommy gun.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a real hard-core guy--a guy who was really feared, even by his
own squad," says veteran private eye Ernie Rizzo.</TE>
<TE>   Hanhardt waged war on burglary rings and cartage thieves who made off
with televisions, cigarettes, anything that could be lifted off a
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no peers in terms of his police career," says Chuck Adamson, a
former Chicago cop who wrote for the TV show "Crime Story" and a longtime
Hanhardt friend.</TE>
<TE>   In his heyday, Hanhardt headed the Central Investigations Unit, a
handpicked team that targeted, among others, jewel thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Hanhardt was rewarded with powerful posts: commander
of the burglary section, chief of detectives, and one of a handful of
deputy superintendents. He retired in 1986 as a captain.</TE>
<TE>   As his 33-year career ended, Hanhardt became a consultant to "Crime
Story," a film-noir TV series about an elite team of Chicago detectives
that takes on the mob.</TE>
<TE>   Adamson says there was a lot of Hanhardt in the show's hero, Lt. Mike
Torello, a hard-living, make-his-own-rules guy played by actor Dennis
Farina, a former Chicago cop himself.</TE>
<TE>   The Torello character hailed from the near West Side neighborhood,
"the Patch," where Hanhardt grew up--alongside a number of mob bosses.</TE>
<TE>   The show seemed a case of art imitating life: There were stories about
cartage heists, home invaders--even a jewel theft from a car trunk.</TE>
<TE>   At some point in his glory years--decades ago--people started to
whisper about Hanhardt.</TE>
<TE>   "The rumors were, 'How can a cop be so be great unless he had the
inside track at something?' " Rizzo says. "He would know who committed a
score hours after it happened."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Fuesel, a retired Internal Revenue Service agent who worked on
organized crime cases during the 1960s and '70s, says he was told by
members of the police intelligence unit "to stay away from that guy."</TE>
<TE>   One longtime con said several years ago that in the 1960s, the word on
the grapevine was that mobsters were paying the master detective $1,200 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help when Hanhardt showed up in places a good cop doesn't
belong: in the little black book of a murdered labor racketeer, on the
witness stand for the defense in the Las Vegas jewelry burglary trial of
reputed mobster Anthony "the Ant" Spilotro.</TE>
<TE>   Hanhardt's lawyers dismiss the accusations as the words of lowlifes
who held grudges.</TE>
<TE>   Hanhardt defended his own record in an affidavit last year, saying he
and others in his command arrested numerous mobsters.</TE>
<TE>   Hanhardt has not spoken publicly since being charged, but in a 1995
interview with Richard Lindberg, author of several books on Chicago
police and crime, he offered his perspective on life as a cop:</TE>
<TE>   "You knew that you're going to get [cheated] eventually, so you went
into the game with that thought in mind. . . . You got a wife. You got
kids. So you got to think about the future, right? But I never liked
thinking about the future. I liked to live for the moment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The FBI pursued Hanhardt with the same dogged detective work he might
once have applauded. By 1996, a decade after he had retired, the
government was wiretapping his home phone, recording hundreds of
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   The tapes revealed Hanhardt was calling police department contacts,
who did database searches on jewelers.</TE>
<TE>   The feds also obtained copies from an informant of index cards with
information on jewelers used by Hanhardt and others to conduct
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Hanhardt's doom may have been sealed in 1999 when an associate in the
jewel theft ring got involved in a nasty divorce. The wife led Rizzo, the
private eye, to a bank safe deposit box. It contained scores of uncut
diamonds and jewels--plus a phony ID her husband had used, along with
phone bugs and car-tracing beepers.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the stash soon spilled out. And the FBI swooped in with
subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of 2000, Hanhardt and five other men--including the one
involved in the divorce--were charged with operating a nationwide theft
ring that stalked jewelry salespeople and stole more than $5 million in
gems and watches.</TE>
<TE>   One heist occurred near the end of Hanhardt's career, the others after
he retired.</TE>
<TE>   Over 12 years, there were eight thefts and two attempts, including
that 1996 incident in Indiana, involving the same salesman as in the
Milwaukee job.</TE>
<TE>   Snatching platinum and diamonds, watches, earrings and bracelets--most
never recovered--the thieves had successful scores in Arizona,
California, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest was a $1.5-million heist from safe-deposit boxes at the
Columbus, Ohio, Hyatt Regency hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the group stalked more than 100 jewelry
salespeople handling more than $40 million in merchandise over 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The thieves used coded language and aliases, carried lock picks and
listening devices and kept meticulous records on potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   They convinced auto manufacturers they were dealers to get access
codes to cut new keys for cars.</TE>
<TE>   And they bought luggage that matched bags carried by their targets, so
they could make a quick switch.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, a day before Hanhardt was to plead guilty to
transporting stolen property across state lines and racketeering
conspiracy charges, he overdosed on pain pills in an apparent suicide
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   About a week later, the man who once wore a neatly pressed blue
uniform, appeared in court in an orange jumpsuit:</TE>
<TE>   "Are you pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty?" the judge
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir, I am," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   William Hanhardt is set to be sentenced April 29. He faces up to 25
years in prison, although attorneys have suggested that federal
guidelines could make it closer to 12 years. That could be a life
sentence for Hanhardt, who at 73 has survived a bout with cancer and has
other health problems.</TE>
<TE>   In his plea, Hanhardt admitted to few specifics but acknowledged
participating in some thefts. Four co-defendants, some with lengthy mob

<TE>   It is an ignominious ending to a once-celebrated career.</TE>
<TE>   And Lindberg, the author, has a theory about why it happened:</TE>
<TE>   "I think he did it because of the rush," he says. "People working
inside the system believe that they're outside the rules of the game. . .
. I'm certain Hanhardt believe[d] that he was never going to get caught.
. . . It's Chicago--and as they say in Chicago, anything goes."</TE>

<HD>Battle Cry Sounds Over Graves of War</HD>
<DH>France: Memories of World War I clash with travelers' needs as the
government plans an airport in an area dotted with old battlefields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM HOUSEGO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHAULNES, France
</DL>
<LD>Pvt. Andrew Creasy was killed near the end of World War I during a
final, desperate offensive by German forces through the Somme.</LD>
<LD>   The British soldier lies in a small cemetery amid potato and chicory
fields. For now.</LD>
<LD>   France's plan to build a futuristic airport in a region dotted with
old battlefields could force the removal of more than 1,000 British,
Australian, Canadian and South African war graves--including Creasy's.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd be horrified to see my granddad's remains moved after all these
years," said Mark Adlam, Creasy's great-grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody can understand the horror of what they went
through," he said in a shaky voice, speaking by telephone from England.
"They were just kids when they died. They must be left where they fell."</TE>
<TE>   The sacred memories of the Great War are clashing with the modern need
to alleviate passenger overload at Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly
airports. The government plans to build a third field at Chaulnes, 80
miles north of Paris, with completion sometime between 2015 and 2020.</TE>
<TE>   French officials say no final decisions have been made about exactly
where the airport's terminals and runways will be laid. But they
acknowledge that at least one Commonwealth cemetery--containing 376
graves, at the heart of the site--almost certainly will have to go.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 1,248 graves of Commonwealth soldiers are within the
boundaries of the proposed airport, along with the remains of 7,200
French.</TE>
<TE>   Adlam was not aware of the airport plans when he recently made his
third trip to his great-grandfather's grave at Bouchoir, one of an
estimated 2 million people who visit war cemeteries in northern France
every year.</TE>
<TE>   The blood-soaked fields of the Somme--where farmers still find the
bones of those who perished--are considered sacrosanct by Commonwealth
countries. A million allied and German soldiers lost their lives in the
four-year stalemate in the murderous trenches of the Somme.</TE>
<TE>   Angered by the airport plan, Commonwealth countries point to the words
engraved in stone at Bouchoir, describing the cemetery as the "free gift
of the French people" for the "perpetual resting place" of the allied
armies who fell in the war.</TE>
<TE>   Annick Carbonnier, an official at the government's Airport Bureau in
the Picardy region, which oversees the project, said war cemeteries would
be shifted only "with the agreement of the countries affected."</TE>
<TE>   She added that the remains would be treated with "the greatest respect
and dignity for the memory of the sacrifice of those soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Johnson of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said the
French government didn't consult the commission before announcing a
revised airport boundary Feb. 26. "Any threat or risk to the war graves
has to be discussed with us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the new airport could force the first mass removal in
Europe of the remains of World War I troops. "The last time part of a
Commonwealth war cemetery was moved was in northern Iraq, more than 15
years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   France has the advantage of a legal loophole. Under terms of a
long-standing agreement with the war graves commission, France can put
the land to alternate use if there is an "overriding public necessity."</TE>
<TE>   Australia, which lost 44,000 soldiers in World War I, is leading
diplomatic efforts to preserve the graves. "They are the resting place of
men who died for freedom and are sacred," Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer said in March.</TE>
<TE>   A brief tour of the grave commission's offices near the northern town
of Arras reveals the enduring importance attached to the cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   About 2,500 sparkling white headstones are still engraved there every
year, to replace damaged ones and to provide a proper resting place for
newly discovered remains--for whom it is written: "Known Unto God."</TE>
<TE>   About once a week, teams of gardeners plant flowers and spray
headstones to keep them clean and shiny.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just the dead that risk being uprooted.</TE>
<TE>   The farming village of Fouquescourt, which lies at the heart of the
proposed airport, almost certainly would be wiped off the map. A
handwritten message hung outside a red brick house with ivy crawling up
its sides informs visitors that "this is the future site of the control
tower."</TE>

facility, a protest sign reads: "Chickens say no to the airport."</CP>

<HD>Japan's Kids Cringe as Schools End 6-Day Weeks</HD>
<DH>Education: Students and their parents fear they won't be able to
compete for colleges, jobs with a mere five days of study.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENJI HALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Satoru Shiina is upset at Japan's decision to end Saturday classes
at public schools and put the kids on a five-day week.</LD>
<LD>   "I could fall behind students who are in cram school or at other
schools that go six days a week," Shiina says. "I have to go to college
and find a job, but I don't know I will be able to."</LD>
<LD>   Shiina is 12 years old.</LD>
<TE>   But even if boys as young as he are fretting, not to mention parents,
a 100-year-old tradition is ending as Japan's 2,110 primary and secondary
public schools open for the new academic year over the next couple of
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Monday-to-Friday schooling slashes 100 hours from the school year and
cuts back the workload that students are given each year by as much as
30%. It does, however, require three hours a week of extracurricular
pursuits such as debate, ping pong or judo.</TE>
<TE>   The move is in line with a larger trend toward putting in fewer hours
at work and allowing more time for hobbies or family. The government has
in recent years added more public holidays. Many companies, hit by the
slumping economy, have introduced five-day weeks and reduced overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's education ministry believes the new curriculum at public
schools, which teach 87.6% of all students, will better educate children
by focusing on reasoning and independent thinking rather than
memorization.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, all students have had to memorize the same . . .
characters and mathematical equations. But that isn't enough anymore,"
said Hironobu Asami, who heads the ministry's curriculum section.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese kids become aware at an early age that if they don't study
hard and get into a good university, they can say goodbye to the Japanese
dream of a nice job at a big-name company.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's schools have earned international praise for achieving near
100% literacy. Children here consistently score higher on achievement
tests than Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of successful test-takers, Japan needs innovators and
virtuosos, said Shumon Miura, a former chairman of the national
curriculum committee that advises the government.</TE>
<TE>   "This new elite will be people who will choose their own calling--not
like in the past when the so-called elite were chosen based on the
schools they attended," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Japan still has a strong workaholic bent. Some parents and
teachers argue that children and teenagers already study less. Working
parents complain they will have to choose between taking time off from
their jobs or finding a baby-sitter.</TE>
<TE>   "As a teacher, I will get to spend more time with my own kids," said
Akemi Ueno, a sixth-grade teacher. "But as a parent, I realize that this
will give public-school children more free time and less homework and
make it harder for them to compete with private-school children."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   Takehiko Kariya, a professor at Tokyo University, says statistics
suggest that reforms in the early 1990s cutting some weekend classes and
loosening curriculum requirements haven't helped youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   In one of his recent studies, less than half of Tokyo fifth-graders
tested could solve basic arithmetic problems--compared with 89% at the
same schools 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya said that instead of freeing up kids' minds, national policy is
widening the gap between the intellectual haves and have-nots. "It's
irresponsible to force a policy that nobody is certain will work--and
that legally requires all [public] schools to comply--on such a huge
system as this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many private schools, meanwhile, are looking to capitalize on parents'
anger. They plan to stay on the Monday-Saturday schedule.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Orders Banking 'Holiday'</HD>
<DH>Finance: Freeze is to last indefinitely while government tries to
rescue its economy. Foreign exchange is also halted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
</DL>
<LD>The Argentine government ordered an indefinite halt to all foreign
exchange and banking transactions Friday, saying it needed time to
finalize a plan to bolster the troubled banking system.</LD>
<LD>   The Central Bank announced the move as President Eduardo Duhalde works
to slow a steady outflow of cash that Argentine officials say could spark
a collapse of the country's financial system.</LD>
<LD>   Economy Ministry officials said the banking holiday would remain in
effect until Duhalde and his economic team can complete a program to
convert most savings accounts into bonds--a plan they say would brake a
growing number of lawsuits against a four-month-old banking freeze.</LD>
<TE>   Long lines of Argentines seeking to pull out cash from automated
teller machines immediately began forming outside many Buenos Aires
banks.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Argentine officials have been searching for ways to slow
thousands of court cases challenging the banking restrictions, first
imposed Dec. 1 to prevent a run on the country's banks.</TE>
<TE>   But thousands of Argentines have successfully won court orders
overturning the freeze, pulling out more than $100 million a day, banking
analysts say. The withdrawals have left many banks short of cash since
few fresh deposits are being made.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions limit cash withdrawals to $500 a month and have
triggered protests outside many banks. The near daily demonstrations have
forced many banks to install metal coverings on their facades.</TE>
<TE>   The drain of deposits forced at least one bank to close temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Central Bank suspended for 30 days all operations by
Scotiabank Quilmes, an Argentine unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia,
because of cash problems. Scotiabank Quilmes is Argentina's 11th-largest
bank.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of the bank's clientele crowded outside its branches on
Friday, wondering how they could get their money. Bank officials said
customers would be able to use bank-issued credit cards and withdraw
money from some accounts, but most banking operations would be suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Government spokesman Anibal Fernandez said Duhalde would soon send a
bill to Congress that would further tighten depositors' access to their
savings.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would replace frozen bank accounts with bonds--a plan last
used in 1989 when triple-digit hyperinflation gripped South America's
second-largest economy and the government confiscated some $3.5 billion
in bank deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina is the grips of a four-year recession and reeling from a
steep devaluation of the peso and a $141-billion debt default.</TE>

<HD>Archeologists Leery of Mideast Digs</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>As researcher Ann Macy Roth excavates a burial site just behind the
Great Pyramid in the wind-swept desert near Cairo, her time is spent
peering into her work, not over her shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Some American and other Western archeologists are concerned that
anti-American sentiment since the Sept. 11 attacks might put them at risk
in the Middle East. But Roth, who over the last 14 years has excavated,
studied and mapped out Pharaonic tombs, is mostly concerned with the heat
and the dust.</LD>
<LD>   "I know how people feel about being here at such a time, but I do not
feel it's different from before," she said. "For me it's business as
usual, like it has ever been."</LD>
<TE>   Well, perhaps a bit less crowded than normal. In the months
immediately after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, only
a few hundred tourists visited the Great Pyramids each day, down from
thousands daily in better times. Numbers improved slightly in more recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   Roth, a researcher at Howard University, has worked in Egypt during
some of its most turbulent times--including in the late 1990s, when
Muslim radicals opposed to the Egyptian government sometimes targeted
Western visitors. But the country has witnessed no serious political
unrest since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In Luxor, the site of ancient Thebes in southern Egypt, the number of
tourists is drastically down, as in Cairo. But French archeologist
Francois Larche said foreign excavators continue to come to study the
many Pharaonic sites, though at lesser numbers than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who know Egypt and have been here before know they will be safe
whatever people feel about it outside," said Larche, who started work in
the city's Karnak Temple in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, security has been tightened around archeological
sites and at institutions and hotels used by excavators. In addition,
researchers were cautioned to limit their movements in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit of a nuisance, but it makes me feel more secure," Larche
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gaballah Ali Gaballah, an advisor to the Egyptian government's Supreme
Council of Antiquities and former head of the council, said nearly 300
foreign expeditions are licensed to work in Egypt, and many are here this
season. "No foreign expedition has asked us to provide them with more
security, and if there is need to do so, our police will do it on their
own," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Yemen and Syria, two other Middle Eastern nations where Western
archeologists regularly come to excavate, foreign scholars seem to be
paying attention to the local mood when deciding whether to continue
their projects.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Edens, an archeologist who heads the American Institute
for Yemeni Studies, said several American expeditions called off their
work for this season in the Gulf nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, they don't want to take risks," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen has been considered a breeding ground for Islamic militants. The
U.S. destroyer Cole was bombed by attackers believed linked to Osama bin
Laden as it visited a Yemeni harbor for refueling in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, the FBI issued an alert that warned of a potential
attack linked to Al Qaeda against the United States or U.S. interests in
Yemen. It was the third such warning in less than a year in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   The country, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, also is
known for the kidnapping of foreigners--usually by tribe members seeking
release of jailed comrades or some other action by the government. Edens
noted that the four American expeditions that did come to Yemen have
traveled to rural sites only in convoys under military escort.</TE>
<TE>   In Syria, Michael Meqdisi, head of foreign expeditions at the Ministry
of Culture, said researchers were pushing back their arrivals to April.
The digging season usually starts in Syria in March.</TE>
<TE>   Western archeologists used to regularly work in Iraq, site of the
great ancient civilization of Mesopotamia, but foreign expeditions
stopped coming after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait set off the 1991 Gulf War.</TE>

<HD>New York Families Attend Oklahoma City Ceremony</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Seven-year anniversary of bombing is marked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER L. BROWN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY
</DL>
<LD>Several World Trade Center families and those who lost loved ones
in the Oklahoma bombing comforted each other Friday at ceremonies marking
the seventh anniversary of what had been until Sept. 11 the deadliest act
of terrorism on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 Sept. 11 relatives, survivors and rescue workers stood with
Oklahomans for 168 seconds of silence in memory of the 168 people killed
in the bombing of the federal building on April 19, 1995. Church bells
ended the stillness.</LD>
<LD>   "Today they look just as sad as us," said Nicole Petrocelli, whose
husband, Mark, died at the trade center. "I can see from the expressions
on [their] faces that the pain is never going to go away. But it gives me
hope to see that they are a little stronger than we are."</LD>
<TE>   Standing under the branches of an elm tree that survived the blast,
many wiped away tears as a guitarist played "Amazing Grace" and a bombing
survivor sang "Let There Be Peace on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Families of New York victims placed one white carnation on each of the
empty bronze chairs where the Alfred P. Murrah Building once stood.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to really describe how peaceful a place this is,"
said Anthony Gardner, whose brother died in the twin towers. "My hope is
that we make something as beautiful as what you have made for your loved
ones."</TE>
<TE>   William Rodriguez, who was pulled from the rubble of the trade center,
said he came to thank the Oklahoma City bombing victims who visited New
York last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The support that they gave us was very important because we didn't
have any cathartic, emotional exchange with anyone who had gone through
what we were going through," he said. "They are actually teaching us how
to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of both tragedies said they share a bond that is
unbreakable.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquetta Lair, who placed a bouquet of yellow roses on a chair for
her cousin, Oleta Biddy, said she knows how it feels to wait while
rescuers search through the rubble. Biddy's body was not recovered for
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going through now what we tried to get through then," Lair
said. "It was always there in your face and you couldn't get past it."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, many toured a new exhibit in the memorial museum
that focuses on the similar experiences of terrorist victims. It includes
photographs of people running from the bombed-out federal building, the
flaming twin towers and the smoking Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   It also contains pictures and mementos of six Oklahomans killed in the

<HD>In Quest for Death, ALS Sufferer Finds a Reason to Live</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Nelson Pritchett's death sentence came in the form of a question.</LD>
<LD>   "You've heard of Lou Gehrig's disease?" the doctor said.</LD>
<LD>   Pritchett had gone to the doctor that December day in 1999 for what he
thought was a pinched nerve. Suddenly, at age 57, he had two years to
live.</LD>
<TE>   Driving home, he felt oddly detached as he squinted through the
windshield into the bright Florida sun. It occurred to him that he would
need to sell his house, that he should inform his sons.</TE>
<TE>   That night, in his bed in Gainesville, Fla., Pritchett lay awake. He
wasn't afraid to die, he said later, but dying this way scared him.
Beginning with his arms and legs, then moving ever inward, the
neurological disease would gradually paralyze him. The retired air
traffic controller would lose control of his own body. He would become
completely helpless. He would die gasping for breath.</TE>
<TE>   He vowed to end it before it got to that point. Death was inevitable,
Pritchett said, but suffering should be optional.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the advanced stages of his illness, Pritchett would take his
case to the nation. He would become the face of the right-to-die
movement. That's when something happened that he never expected.</TE>
<TE>   In his fight for the right to die, Nelson Pritchett found a reason to
live.</TE>
<TE>Reconciling With Sons</TE>
<TE>   The day after the doctor's visit, Pritchett called his youngest son,
Eric. He had some "important news," he said, and asked him to arrange a
conference call with his other son, Brian.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, Eric and Brian Pritchett wondered what was going on. The
news couldn't be about his health, they thought. Their father was a
fitness fanatic, had even run marathons. Maybe he was getting married for
a third time.</TE>
<TE>   When Nelson got on the phone with his sons, he struggled to compose
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I have Lou Gehrig's," he managed to blurt out.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, his relationship with his sons had been
strained. They talked only occasionally. But now, in this crisis, Brian
and Eric resolved to try to put old resentments behind them. Father and
sons made plans to spend Christmas together, something they hadn't done
in years.</TE>
<TE>   But the 10-day vacation turned out to be tense. Nelson was emotional,
often breaking down. He also proved to be the same stubborn man they
remembered from their youth, Eric later said. Being diagnosed with a
terminal illness doesn't bring an overnight change in a man who has spent
a lifetime doing things his way.</TE>
<TE>   The day before Eric was to return to Boston, the Pritchetts sat down
to discuss their father's options. At the kitchen table, they mapped out
scenarios. Everything, from marrying someone who could care for him in
exchange for his pension to moving into a nursing home, made the list.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson was adamant about not going to a nursing home. He expressed
interest in moving to Boston to live with Eric.</TE>
<TE>   Eric, 27, struggled with his reluctance. "Look at the empirical
evidence," he later said. "He is an extremely difficult person to live
with."</TE>
<TE>   So Eric laid down ground rules. He'd do what he could, but he wouldn't
sacrifice his business career to become a full-time caregiver. Nelson
would need to arrange for help from health aides and support groups.
Brian, 28, who worked as a waiter and was battling his own problems,
would pitch in with emotional support and errands.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson set about wrapping up his affairs in Gainesville. He also
started speaking out on physician-assisted suicide in his local paper. A
columnist visited and did a series of stories on him.</TE>
<TE>   Before his diagnosis, Pritchett's passion was running. He had jogged
30 miles a week and had run in races in Gainesville, Boston, New York,
Honolulu. He decided to make one last run, a 5K in his hometown. This
would be his farewell to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been running only a few minutes when he tripped and fell to the
pavement, scraping his knees and arms. Moments later, he pitched forward
and scraped his face. He walked the rest of the way, a bloody mess,
supported by friends.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few months, even his walk became unsteady. He could lift
his arms only with great effort.</TE>
<TE>   Eric found a two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise near Boston College,
and in August, his father moved in. It was awkward, after all these
years. The needs of a terminally ill man didn't always go well with a
20-something trying to have a social life. Inevitably, they clashed. At
times, both would regret the arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   In a spiral-bound notebook, Nelson started writing a book for the
grandchildren he would never see. "This could very well be my obituary,"
he scrawled on the first page.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote down his memories and his thoughts on life. He pasted in
photos and mementos. He named places he'd visited and things he'd done.
He made a list of books he wanted his grandchildren to read: "The Power
of Myth" by Joseph Campbell; "The Demon Haunted World," a book debunking
superstition, by Carl Sagan; "The Fourth Turning," an apocalyptic tome by
William Strauss and Neil Howe, a pair of historians.</TE>
<TE>   He endowed a scholarship in his name at his alma mater, Southern
Mississippi University. He established a trust there so Brian could go
back for his degree. Nelson Pritchett was making things right.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Nelson and Eric went on a Mediterranean cruise together.
By now, Nelson needed his son's help getting dressed. When they got back,
Nelson's queen-sized bed was replaced with an adjustable hospital bed.
They ordered a motorized wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson fought hiring a home health aide, then relented. But he refused
to join a support group, insisting he didn't need support.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 2001, Nelson traveled to Georgia to pick out his
tombstone. His ashes would be buried in a family plot in the small town
of Edison. The inscription chiseled into his marker would be: "Thanks for
stopping by."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson also got in touch with the Hemlock Society, the country's
oldest right-to-die group. The group promises that if someone wants to
commit suicide, he or she will not die alone.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson had read, "Tuesdays With Morrie," the best-selling book about
the final year of life of a Lou Gehrig's patient. He wouldn't allow
himself to end up like Morrie, racked by coughing fits and barely able to
speak or move. The book was sugarcoated, Pritchett thought, cloaking pain
and humiliation in homilies and life lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "He died a miserable, suffering death," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   So he studied "Final Exit," the Hemlock Society's how-to-die guide,
underlining paragraphs on suffocating with a plastic bag. He pored over
articles on starvation and dehydration and learned that it could be over
in as little as three days.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson dismissed moral objections to suicide. He grew up in church but
was cynical about organized religion. He labeled religious leaders
"soothsayers." Still, he insisted he believed in God and Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   In November, he told Leo Johnson, a Hemlock volunteer who visited
weekly, that he had made his peace. He was ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   About that time, U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft issued a directive
threatening doctors who prescribed lethal doses of federally controlled
drugs with loss of their licenses. He was targeting Oregon, the only
state that permits assisted suicide. But it was also a warning to other
states.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon challenged the measure, and a judge granted a temporary
restraining order. He scheduled a ruling for spring. Hemlock mobilized
for battle. Pritchett realized he could help. Hemlock board members
eagerly took him on.</TE>
<TE>   He would have to postpone his death, Pritchett told Johnson. He had
things to do now.</TE>
<TE>   In late November, Nelson flew to Washington for a news conference at
the National Press Club. Addressing reporters, his quavering Southern
drawl sounded mournful.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I was in Washington was in 1994 for the Marine Corps
marathon, one of 21 marathons I've run," he said. "Now I can't hardly do
anything. . . . I'm totally dependent on others."</TE>
<TE>   When the time came, he would starve himself, he said. "That's not a
good way to go, I'm told, but I have no choice."</TE>
<TE>   As he gathered momentum, he became angrier. "Hell, I don't want to
die," he said, eyes flashing. "I'm normal." He lectured that his choice
shouldn't be called suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Suicide is when a perfectly healthy person does a dumb thing," he
said. "All I'm wanting is a way out, dying in a way that gives me some
choice. . . . It's not a suicide. I'm already dying."</TE>
<TE>   Hemlock ran ads in the Sunday New York Times, featuring a photo of him
with the headline: "I Am Dying: Either I will decide how I die or someone
will decide for me."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Boston, Nelson was now confined to his bedroom. He weighed
less than 120 pounds, compared with his former running weight of 165. It
took all his strength to lean over and suck juice through a straw.</TE>
<TE>   As the second Christmas after his diagnosis approached, friends had to
open his greeting cards and hold them for him to read. They wondered when
he would carry out his plan.</TE>
<TE>   Not yet, he told Johnson, his Hemlock volunteer. He wanted one last
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>Death Decides</TE>
<TE>   December came and went. One day, watching himself talk about suicide
in a Hemlock Society video, Nelson stifled a sob.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Nelson's trips to the bathroom were carefully planned
around when people would be there to help. To bathe, he lay flat on his
back in bed as his health aide, Nories Giraldi, cleaned him.</TE>
<TE>   The man who so valued control had lost most of it, but Pritchett had
been undergoing a change. His standards for what he could tolerate had
been raised, he acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Eric noticed. "The human animal is the most adaptable thing," he said.
"Things you consider as unacceptable quality of life before become normal
and fine."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson's advocacy for the right to die had given his life a new
purpose, said Elaine McMillen, a Hemlock volunteer and friend. "The PR
stuff is his reason for continuing," she said. "He wants people to know."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson remained jovial during visits by his aide. When she helped him
from his chair to the bed, he would lift his feet and sway back with her,
calling out, "Nories, we're dancing!"</TE>
<TE>   He talked for hours with visitors, lecturing and badgering.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-January, he entertained a visitor for two days with his stories
and thoughts. He still had a lot of life left to live, he confided.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I go now?" he said. "I don't want to check out early."</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 20, Nelson spent the day watching a Steve Spurrier Florida
Gator highlight marathon on ESPN. He marveled at the beauty of the snow
outside his window. In the evening, he had dinner with Eric.</TE>
<TE>   As it got later, Eric left to meet some friends. Nelson went to bed.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Eric entered his father's room to empty his urine
bottles and set out his toothbrush and shaver. His father's face was
obscured by the pillow.</TE>
<TE>   Eric rolled him over. His skin felt cold.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Nelson Pritchett had neither the death that he planned nor
the one that he feared.</TE>
<TE>   He went peacefully in his sleep.</TE>

<HD>They See You Paying $16 a Minute</HD>
<DH>Psychics: Miss Cleo's firm has routed callers through a tiny South
Pacific island, generating international charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does a tiny island in the South Seas--a place where canned
coconut cream is a major export, and the national budget is subsidized by
the sale of stamps--have to do with Miss Cleo, psychic superstar?</LD>
<LD>   The island in question is Niue (pronounced NEW-ee), and it has figured
in Access Resource Services' quest for new ways to make and collect money
from its psychic hotlines.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T is pulling out of the business of billing for 900 numbers, and
Access--the company represented by Miss Cleo in television ads--must find
another way to bill. It is trying to convince callers to use their credit
cards, charging a monthly fee of $29.95 for 30 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   But Jon Sorensen, a spokesman for the New York State Consumer
Protection Board, says Access also has directed some callers to use an
international phone number that would take their calls all the way to
Niue and back to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting per-minute charges ranged from $7 to $16, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Niue is located 1,500 miles from New Zealand, between Tonga, Samoa and
the Cook Islands. It is tiny--half-again as big as the District of
Columbia--but still has had its infamous moments.</TE>
<TE>   Niue has been accused of fostering money laundering, and has also been
linked to a scam in which software, planted in computers, took control of
modems and made calls to porn lines with numbers in Niue, unbeknownst to
the owners of the computers.</TE>
<TE>   It also has been a favorite of some telemarketers who run porn or
psychic hotlines.</TE>
<TE>   This is how it works: The companies contract with Niue to take their
calls. With fewer than 2,000 people--and 400 telephone lines--Niue has no
city or area codes, so every number on the island is 683 and four digits.
"It would be easy for the naive or ignorant to imagine they were making a
local call," according to a report on the phenomenon in the Economist
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The companies split the profits with the Niue telephone company.
Apparently Access, like other such companies, merely routed the calls
through Niue and back to the United States on a leased line, where they
were then dispatched to psychics around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The charges show up on telephone bills as ordinary international
calls.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Marmen, a psychic for Access, says he received calls from people
who had reached him this way last fall. One woman thought the call was
covered under her 5-cent-a-minute long distance plan.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Moynihan, a lawyer for Access, says the company may have
experimented with international calls, but "that's not something the
company is going to go into."</TE>

<HD>Human Microchips Elicit Hope, Fear</HD>
<DH>Technology: The rice-size objects can hold crucial medical data.
But critics fear 'Big Brother' will hold the scanner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADRIAN SAINZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Jeff Jacobs' neck is fused to his spine at a slightly downward
angle, making it painful for him to look straight ahead without leaning
back. He takes up to 10 medications a day for a number of other ailments,
and several times he has nearly died.</LD>
<LD>   One of his family's biggest worries is that he could become sick and
unable to speak for himself in an emergency.</LD>
<LD>   But thanks to a tiny computer chip that can be implanted in his body
and scanned for personal and medical information, those fears may be
eased.</LD>
<TE>   Jacobs, his wife, Leslie, and their 14-year-old son, Derek, could
become the nation's first family to be fitted with the device, called
VeriChip. It is awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The VeriChip, made by Applied Digital Solutions in Palm Beach County,
Fla., is about the size of a grain of rice. It would be injected under a
person's skin, probably in the arm, and could be read only by scanners.</TE>
<TE>   Similar technology has been used in the past few years on millions of
dogs and cats as a way to identify the pets if they are lost or stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Applied Digital says the chip can provide instant access to a
patient's medical records, which is especially valuable in emergencies or
in situations in which the patient is unconscious and unable to provide a
medical history or, say, allergies to any medications. It could, for
example, be used to identify and diagnose a lost Alzheimer's patient.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the chips could be coupled with global positioning
satellites to locate Alzheimer's patients who have wandered off, or to
find kidnapping victims--an idea the company hopes to market in Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   The chip could also be used as a security tool.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be used as an inexpensive method to gain entry into a secure
power plant, the cockpit of an airplane, or any place where a high level
of authentication is required for entrance to a building," said Keith
Bolton, Applied Digital vice president and chief technology officer.
"It's a lot less expensive than retina scanning or thumbprint-recognition
equipment."</TE>
<TE>   The chip has stirred debate over its potential use as a "Big Brother"
device to track people or invade the privacy of their homes or
workplaces. Civil libertarians call it crypto-fascism or high-tech
slavery. Religious advocates say it represents "the mark of the Beast,"
or the anti-Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs and his family brush aside those arguments. Anyone can be
tracked through the Internet and e-mail, credit cards and cellular
phones, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of amazed there's such a hullabaloo about it," Jacobs
said. "It's like someone presenting the world with a gift. It's
inconceivable this could do anything but good."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, a 48-year-old dentist, has suffered through cancer, a car
crash, a degenerative spinal condition, chronic eye disease and abdominal
operations. He has had to quit his dental practice, and doctors have told
him they are not sure how long he will live.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs' son heard about the device from the news and pestered his
mother to call Applied Digital.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband almost died four or five times. We have been rushed to the
hospital where he is unable to talk, and these nurses and doctors ask him
for information," she said. "This way, they can take two seconds to scan
it and you have the information, accurately."</TE>
<TE>   The chip is expected to cost around $200 and the scanner between
$1,000 and $3,000. Applied Digital plans to give away chip readers to
hospitals and ambulance companies in hopes they will become standard
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of a decision from the FDA is unclear, but approval is
probably several months away at the earliest.</TE>

<HD>6 Injured When Servers Ignite Bar Top in Iowa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IOWA CITY, Iowa
</DL>
<LD>Bartenders who allegedly poured rum on a bar top and ignited it to
entertain patrons could face criminal charges, police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   At least six people were burned in the fire last week.</LD>
<LD>   Bartenders at the college hangout Et Cetera learned the stunt in
Acapulco, Police Chief R.J. Winkelhake said. Investigators are reviewing
whether it violated fire codes.</LD>
<TE>   People clapped as they watched the bartenders ignite the rum, creating
a flickering line of fire, said Scott VandenBusch, a student from
Franklin, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, there was a huge fireball. Everybody was right up
against the bar when it happened. It flashed for about two or three
seconds. The whole group started screaming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw this flame go up and we all backed away," said Whitney
Grabinski, a University of Iowa student.</TE>
<TE>   One woman suffered third-degree burns to her face and hands. Three

<HD>Columbine Victim's Father Admits Mistake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>The father of Columbine High School victim Daniel Rohrbough says he
was wrong to name a Denver police officer as his son's killer.</LD>
<LD>   "I accept the responsibility for being wrong," Brian Rohrbough said
Thursday, a day after an independent investigation concluded that his son
was shot and killed by Columbine gunman Eric Harris--not by Sgt. Daniel
O'Shea, as Rohrbough had claimed.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Rohrbough was among 12 students and a teacher killed by Harris
and Dylan Klebold during the rampage at the school in suburban Littleton
on April 20, 1999. Harris and Klebold then killed themselves in the
school library.</LD>
<TE>   The Rohrbough family had alleged in a lawsuit that O'Shea mistakenly
killed Daniel, something that investigators had denied all along.</TE>
<TE>   The Jefferson County sheriff's office, the lead agency in charge of
responding to the Columbine attack, asked El Paso County authorities to
investigate the Rohrboughs' claims because that agency's deputies were
not involved in the initial response.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a great deal of things I regret," Rohrbough said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But he stopped short of apologizing to O'Shea. O'Shea's lawyer, David
Bruno, said anything less than an apology was insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal feeling is that when you accuse someone publicly of
committing murder, of being a liar and of covering up a killing, maybe
you can erase some of the damage by publicly apologizing," Bruno said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Shea could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough said he would like to meet with O'Shea privately rather than
express his feelings publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "If O'Shea doesn't want to talk to me, I fully understand that. But
I'd certainly like the opportunity to talk to him face to face,"
Rohrbough said.</TE>
<TE>   Rohrbough said he met with El Paso County investigators for more than
three hours Wednesday and left believing neither O'Shea nor any other
officer killed his son.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will drop O'Shea's name from a lawsuit now on appeal in the
10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He said he had not decided whether to
drop the entire suit, which accuses the Jefferson County sheriff's office
and other agencies of not doing enough to prevent the shootings and of
botching the response.</TE>

<DL>TUCSON, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>Archeologists are almost finished excavating a site along the Santa
Cruz River that was once the home of one of the biggest ancient Hohokam
communities.</LD>
<LD>   Archeologists hired by Southwest Gas Corp. have been working for
nearly two months to excavate the site south of Tucson where some of the
area's earliest inhabitants lived.</LD>
<LD>   The excavation where the gas company is replacing a pipeline has
uncovered part of one of the biggest late-period Hohokam settlements in
the area, dating from about 1200 to 1450 A.D.</LD>
<TE>   The utility plans to replace the pipe and fill over the site this
week, preserving it for future generations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really exciting, because this is the late period and nobody
knows much about it," said John Hayes, the on-site field director.</TE>
<TE>   The overall village site, which may span a square mile or more, has
been known since the 1920s and was surveyed by University of Arizona
students in the 1930s. But it has never been extensively excavated
because most of it lies beneath private land, project manager Fred
Huntington said.</TE>
<TE>   The current dig site was ripped through in the 1950s to lay the
original gas line, before federal laws mandated preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists are still trying to determine what happened to the
Hohokam culture.</TE>
<TE>   Since the current dig site consists of a 25-foot-wide swath about 150
yards long, Huntington said it may be difficult to create a comprehensive
picture of life in the village.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble is, we're getting a skewed view, because it's such a
narrow site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What the dig has revealed is a honeycomb of adjacent houses, complete
with adobe walls and floors.</TE>
<TE>   The site, known as the Zanardelli site after the family that once
farmed the land, may be of special significance because it shows homes
built in walled compounds--like our modern gated communities, Huntington
said.</TE>
<TE>   The dig has also yielded numerous artifacts, including the cremated
remains of several Hohokam; pot shards; grinding tools; and shell jewelry
likely from the Sea of Cortez off the Mexican coast.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of pottery with designs traced to the Salado, a group
originating from the Roosevelt Lake area, provides evidence that the
Hohokam traded and otherwise interacted with the northerners.</TE>
<TE>   Along with corn, beans and squash, the Hohokam are believed to have
extensively cultivated agave in rock-based gardens for food and fiber.</TE>
<TE>   The human remains, artifacts buried with them and any ceremonial
objects will be turned over to the Tohono O'odham tribe. Tohono O'odham
members are believed to be descendants of the Hohokam.</TE>
<TE>   Other artifacts will be analyzed and turned over to the Arizona State
Museum at the University of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington said his company--Tierra Archaeological and Environmental
Consultants--will publish a report about their discoveries by the end of
the year.</TE>

<HD>N.M. Rattlesnake Roundup Shakes Up Local Activists</HD>
<DH>West: Animal rights advocates contend the event is cruel and upsets
the balance of nature. Organizers say private landowners want the snakes
removed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE HERRERA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE
</DL>
<LD>Texan Don Castillo's rattlesnake chili has been a big hit in
Minnesota and Iowa. Now comes the ultimate test--pitching it to
chili-savvy New Mexicans.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo, who hails from the tiny Texas town of Clyde, will be cooking
his chili this weekend at the annual Rattlesnake Roundup in Alamogordo.
It's an event that each year draws up to 6,000 curious, if not cautious,
folks to the Otero County Fairgrounds and a small but vociferous band of
critics, the latter including state Land Commissioner Ray Powell.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a gimmick to make money exploiting these animals," Powell said
of the roundup, in which 1,200 or so rattlesnakes are captured each year.
The snakes, many of them Western diamondbacks, are coaxed out of their
winter holes or captured in the hills near Alamogordo and neighboring
areas.</LD>
<TE>   There's very little middle ground when it comes to the rattler
roundup. On one side are Powell and animal rights groups. On the other
are individuals such as Castillo and Ralph Coleman, an organizer of the
event who calls Powell "a bunny hugger."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, a veterinarian, says the roundup is not only cruel but also
causes enormous damage to the balance of nature. The more snakes that are
removed, he says, the greater the population of rodents.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have a good balance of predators, the rodent population
can go out of control," Powell said. "In a state like New Mexico, where
we have the hantavirus and plague, this is a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   Hantavirus is an often-deadly disease carried by rodents, particularly
deer mice. Usually contracted by inhaling dried particles of their urine,
saliva or feces, the illness has been blamed for the deaths of more than
two dozen people in the state since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is warning those taking part in the roundup that if they remove
snakes from state trust lands, they will be considered trespassers.
Powell also plans to ask the Legislature next year to ban such events.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exploiting a really important species that helps protect our
delicate balance in our desert ecosystems," Powell says. "This is 2002
and it's just incredible that this is still happening."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman contends snakes do more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a lot of flack from the bunny huggers," Coleman said. "But
most of the snakes are gathered from private land, where the owners want
the snakes removed. They're endangering their kids, their livestock and
their pets."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Coleman said, the annual rattlesnake roundup brings in a lot
of money to Alamogordo because there's a lot more to see than snakes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can eat snake meat, we've got a gun-and-craft show, and some
people sell antiques and jewelry," Coleman said. "It's a big financial
impact on this city."</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen protesters showed up at last year's roundup, and that's
likely to be the case again this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's an important issue to stand up against," said Michele
Rokke, animal program director for Animal Protection of New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Rokke agrees with Powell that snake roundups are both inhumane and
damaging to the ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   "We're equally concerned with the suffering of the animals involved,"
Rokke said. "How they are captured, how they are kept until the weekend
event begins. They're subjected to a lot of torment and cruelty and are
inhumanely slaughtered at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Rattlesnake hunts are popular in other Western states. One of the
largest takes place each year in Sweetwater, Texas, and five communities
in Oklahoma hold roundups in April and May.</TE>
<TE>   The rattler-gatherers in Alamogordo, most of them amateurs, get about
$4 a pound for the snakes they bring in. The average snake runs about a
pound, but last year the roundup included a 6-foot rattler that weighed 9
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who runs a concession company, will buy this year's catch of
snakes, drown them and then sell virtually every part of them. The meat
will go to a buyer in California who sells it to restaurants as a
delicacy.</TE>
<TE>   "The meat is very delicious," said Castillo, describing the taste as a
combination of chicken and shrimp. "No fat and no cholesterol in it."</TE>
<TE>   The skins are used to make items like belts, billfolds and hatbands.
The rattlers are made into earrings and key chains and the heads are sold
as souvenirs.</TE>

<LD>What good is a neighborhood club without a clubhouse? That's the sad
state of affairs confronting more than 100 Boys &amp; Girls Club members
in a predominantly Latino neighborhood of San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Capistrano faces a $200,000 budget
shortfall that will force the El Camino clubhouse to close May 3.
Parents and community activists recently protested the decision, but
the board argues that the site--sandwiched between an elementary
school and a residential area--is too small and in need of extensive
repairs.</LD>
<LD>   Youthful members view the clubhouse that once was part of the old
Capistrano Union High School as a safe, fun place to hang out. Their
parents depend on the clubhouse for much-needed after-school care.</LD>
<TE>   The organization's board, however, seems to be facing a problem
without an affordable solution. Even if $200,000 were to fall into
the board's lap, the board's short-term lease with the Capistrano
Unified School District means it would not make sense to make capital
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The club plans to bus children to a clubhouse near Marco F.
Forster Middle School, about two miles from the soon-to-be-abandoned
facility. The city isn't charging the club for the newer, larger
space. It's already the after-school home to more than 300 youths.
This may work as a temporary solution, but parents obviously would
rather have their children closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   In a perfect world, a donor with deep pockets would fill the
deficit hole. Parents and community leaders hope to raise funds and
find corporate sponsors to keep their neighborhood facility open.
They are lobbying the school district for a longer-term lease and
asking the San Juan Capistrano City Council for financial help. One
club member said, "We don't ask for much, and we don't complain. We
just want somewhere to go." She's right. It really is worth the
effort because the building provides a needed gathering place for
neighborhood youth.</TE>

<LD>As disturbing as the recent closure of nearly a half-mile of
shoreline in Huntington Beach is, at least the city and public health
officials have the benefit of painful experience to guide them this
time around. They ought to take advantage of it, and not wait for
another lost summer before broadening the search for suspects beyond
local sewage leaks. Every effort must be made to identify and correct
the source of high bacterial counts to avoid a repeat performance of
the brutal season of 1999, when miles of waterfront were off-limits.</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, the news from the Huntington shore has been like
an echo of the past. First, high bacteria counts prompted the Orange
County Health Care Agency to indefinitely close a stretch to swimmers
and surfers. Then the hunt for a source began in earnest, first
zeroing in on restrooms suspected of leaking human waste into the
surf.</LD>
<LD>   Back in 1999, when officials also found high bacteria counts, they
began their search at the same place. The search identified a few
leaks but gradually the sleuths came to understand that the source of
pollution that closed stretches of beach to swimmers for much of the
summer would be much harder to identify.</LD>
<TE>   The hoped-for result from any beach closing is that the source of
the pollution will be identified quickly, and that the problem can be
remedied without being prohibitively expensive. When a lot of money
is spent to identify a problem, and there still is no definite
answer, the search becomes frustrating. That is in addition to the
dislocation that occurs when the local economy suffers from lost
tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The city, county, Orange County Sanitation District and other
agencies already have poured millions into the effort to find out
what has been going on in recent years offshore at Huntington Beach.
Still, there are the lingering concerns about the effects of the
giant offshore sewage plume, released more than four miles offshore
by the sanitation district. The district long has maintained that its
partially treated sewage, permissible under a waiver from the Clean
Water Act, stays harmlessly offshore. But a recent study by the
Scripps Institute of Oceanography and UC Irvine raises questions. The
district's waiver already is being widely challenged, and it will
have to make a decision soon whether to reapply. Surely it should
know whether there is any link between the recent pollution problem
and the plume. There are immediate and long-term reasons why the
region needs to know more about this pollution.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there already is the record of all that sleuthing along
local sewer lines to suggest that a broader source of pollution needs
to be considered sooner, rather than later. Don't leave anything to
chance this time, which would only invite longer delays in taking
action and open the possibility of another lost summer.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the pollution source is, it should be identified and
addressed now.</TE>

<LD>The city of Cypress' turf battle over a vacant lot in the shadow of
the Los Alamitos Race Course underscores the unduly strong influence
that municipal pocketbooks have on development in Orange County.
Whether it's a Costco being built on the lot in Cypress or the newly
approved Home Depot planned in San Juan Capistrano, cash-strapped
local governments are assigning too much weight to projects that
promise to drive additional sales tax receipts.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't a new issue. The nonprofit Public Policy Institute of
California three years ago asked officials in 300 local governments
to name the biggest influences on land development. Sales tax revenue
topped the list for these cash-strapped municipalities. It's hard for
cities to defend zoning decisions when angry residents and competing
developers can point to the local government's addiction to new sales
tax receipts. Disgruntled residents in five California communities
last month used the ballot box to circumvent city planning processes
and close the doors on Ikea, Home Depot and other retailers.</LD>
<TE>   The only point of agreement in Cypress is that something should be
built at the corner of Katella Avenue and Walker Street. The 18-acre
sea of asphalt is interrupted only by the occasional weed patch and
an abandoned snack bar that once catered to swap-meet bargain
hunters. Cottonwood Christian Center in 1999 paid $13 million for the
land it envisions as home to a complex that would replace its cramped
building in a Los Alamitos industrial park. The city, with an eager
eye on potential sales tax revenue, wants to turn the corner lot over
to a developer with ties to Costco or another big retailer.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, the church and racetrack owner Edward C. Allred
for months had been talking about a land swap that would give the
city its retail development and shift the proposed church to adjacent
land that Allred owns. Negotiations unfortunately broke down. The
city is signaling its intent to use eminent domain to take the
parcel, which is in a redevelopment district. The church is suing the
city under a federal law that places strict limits on government's
ability to stop religious building projects.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress shouldn't be standing in the way of Cottonwood. The city
has two options. It could process the church's application and clear
the way for construction. The city spent months negotiating with the
church on a possible land swap that would have resulted in a retail
development being built on the contested corner and a church complex
rising next door. So the city will be hard-pressed to say that a
church doesn't belong in this neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Or the city could take a deep breath and return to the table in
the hope of reaching agreement on the proposed land swap. A
negotiated settlement would give the city its sales tax infusion and
the church would get a new home and spare both sides a lengthy and
costly court fight.</TE>
<TE>   There's no easy solution at hand for the zoning disputes that will
continue to surface in Orange County when retail developments and
automobile dealerships are proposed. Consider the 131,00-square-foot
Home Depot that recently was approved near downtown San Juan
Capistrano. Opponents argue that the store will create traffic jams,
pollute the air and block ocean breezes--in short, do everything but
accelerate global warming. Whether or not the criticisms are
justified, the city's clear desire to bolster sales tax receipts
casts an unwanted shadow on the planning process. What cities approve
should be consistent with a neighborhood's character and good
planning principles.</TE>
<TE>   Though not an immediate solution for Orange County, a bill that
would modify how local sales tax revenues are distributed in the
Sacramento area, AB 680, focuses the kind of attention that is needed
on the problem. Sales tax revenue is important, but it must not
override sound planning and zoning at the local level.</TE>

<LD>Re "'Lock 'Em Up' Isn't Enough," commentary, April 1:</LD>
<LD>   Jay Adams is correct that locking up sex offenders will not
resolve the problem, but I must take issue with his stand that these
people are victims of the criminal justice system's inadequate
funding.</LD>
<LD>   Adams says "they are required to register as sex offenders [but]
receive little help because parole resources are overwhelmed." Parole
and probation officers monitor their clients' performance as
productive citizens, but they don't provide monetary help for
mental-health care.</LD>
<TE>   Society expects me to pay my own way when I am gainfully employed
and have no criminal history. Similarly, sex offenders who've paid
their debt to society should also be expected to foot their bills.
That most of them will have less-than-stellar jobs is not a concern
for the justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The fact of the matter is that no additional burden should be
placed on the parole system when it comes to administering
health-care costs. These people should be held accountable for their
actions.</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C.'s Code Rulings Are Unfair, Say Longtime Canyon Dwellers,"
April 15:</LD>
<LD>   I read with interest the article about Orange County rulings on
matters involving canyon property as being unfair to residents but
liberal to commercial interests.</LD>
<LD>   I was particularly fascinated by the strenuous denials by county
staff and Supervisor Todd Spitzer. Though not in favor of a loosening
of standards for canyon dwellers (I am a 13-year resident of Trabuco
Canyon), I agree wholeheartedly with the accusations of bias and
political favoritism.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the most egregious examples of county bureaucratic largess
occur at the southern end of the canyons. Several lawsuits have been
filed over the years regarding county-approved plans for Trabuco
Canyon, including a gas station and strip mall at the canyon's
gateway (Cook's Corner) and major housing developments that are also
in the works.</TE>
<TE>   The worst example of all is the decision by the county to create a
special exemption to allow a jail (Rancho Potrero Leadership Academy)
that is contrary to environmental laws. The jail project is being
proposed at exorbitant cost (the most expensive jail per bed in the
United States) and is against the wishes of the vast majority of
canyon residents.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer is supposed to be our representative. Yet as a guardian of
the little remaining open space in Orange County, Spitzer sets a poor
precedent for his ability to provide balanced leadership as an
assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   As for Thomas B. Mathews, director of the county's Planning and
Development Services Department, he protests that suburban norms are
finally reaching the rural areas--but he is the one actually
providing minimal oversight and in some cases facilitating the
destruction.</TE>

<LD>Re "Accident Victim Is Awarded $5.2 Million," April 11:</LD>
<LD>   So Keith Saul sped through a construction zone, lost control after
hitting some gravel and became a quadriplegic. And an Orange County
jury awarded him a $5.2-million judgment against Yorba Linda, a
construction company and the water district? This in spite of the

<LD>Re "Capistrano Unified Can Afford Teacher Raises," letters, April14:</LD>
<LD>   I am hopeful you will look into the comments of the Capistrano
Unified School District in regard to the salaries paid to our
classroom teachers.</LD>
<LD>   The district is up to its old tricks again and publishing salaries
for personnel that hold teaching credentials but are not currently
classroom teachers. In my opinion, the only outrageous salary is held
by district Superintendent James A. Fleming. Given the money he and
his staff are paid, they have fallen short of any insightful
management of this district. Good teachers deserve good salaries</LD>

<LD>Re "Protesters Allege Placentia Police Abuse," April 9:</LD>
<LD>   Commenting on a protest held by community activists against police
abuse, Placentia Police Sgt. Eric Point claims protesters surrounded
a police car, adding that, "I don't know what their intentions were."</LD>
<LD>   I was at the protest and saw what really happened. When an officer
stopped his car at a red light, about six protesters entered the
crosswalk and stood in front of the police car, chanting, "No
justice, no peace." They went back onto the sidewalk before the light
changed so they would not be in the street blocking traffic. None of
the protesters even left the crosswalk zone.</LD>
<TE>   Point's comments are evidence of the blatant racism in the
Placentia Police Department that activists are fighting to end. It's
doubtful Point would have made the same comments about peaceful
protesters had they been white.</TE>
<TE>   Implying that protesters who are people of color have some other
negative intention is exactly what perpetuates the endless cycle of
violence and discrimination Placentia residents face at the hands of
a racist police department.</TE>

<LD>Re "Plans for Base Link Mayor, Irvine Co.," March 31:</LD>
<LD>   Recent history taught us the dangers in a 3-2 majority vote
deciding the future of the closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1994, the three-vote majority has been at the county Board
of Supervisors. If Irvine Mayor Larry Agran has his way, the
three-vote majority soon will be Agran and City Council allies Chris
Mears and Beth Krom.</LD>
<TE>   The Times has reported that Agran and Mears raised $42,000 last
September at a fund-raiser sponsored by the Irvine Co. This
disturbing revelation raises serious questions about Irvine
attempting to annex the base, a move that, if successful, could
render Measure W irrelevant. Agran's alliance with the Irvine Co. at
this critical moment raises legitimate fears that he's struck a deal
with Irvine's monopoly landowner and developer.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Agran told The Times he and the company are now "kindred
spirits." Here's how it could work. The Navy sells the base to the
Irvine Co., either directly or through the city of Irvine. After
Irvine annexes the base, the Agran majority grants the developer
rapacious development rights both on and off the base in exchange for
the developer's helping fund Agran's vision for a Great Park.</TE>
<TE>   The first site might be the Northern Sphere project currently
under development. "Larry Agran Park" would become a reality, the
Irvine Co. would rake in more profit, and the people of Orange County
would be stuck with more traffic and pollution. El Toro's fate should
never again be left in the hands of a few. Return base planning to
where it began--with the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, composed
of the South County cities.</TE>
<TE>   Navy guidelines call for the locally impacted communities to
determine a base's reuse. The people of South County must be allowed
to protect themselves from unchecked development. Before Irvine can
annex the base, the city must agree that reuse authority has the
right to review and approve any development plans for the site. This
simple check-and-balance provision would ensure that three people,
two of whom already have accepted major campaign contributions from
those with ties to the developer and pro-airport communities, do not
solely determine the largest planning decision for our county in the
21st century.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Measure W Appeals Argument Is Flawed," letters, April 14:</TE>
<TE>   In the opinion of Ashley Banta, there is no need to challenge
Measure W because Measure A was upheld. That goes against the will of
the people of Fullerton and 20 other North County cities that voted
against Measure W, and Banta also ignores the landmark repudiation of
Measure F, which also was DOA. It is time for Banta to put propaganda
away and move into the 21st century. Thank God for the right to vote
on initiatives that are constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Nyre</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Regional Airport Authority is suing the county
to try to overturn Measure W, which was passed by a vote of 58% to
42% and killed the El Toro airport. The county will have to defend
against the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The county is a member of the authority. Supervisors Chuck Smith,
Jim Silva and Cynthia P. Coad granted the authority $5 million of
public money to promote the airport and oppose Measure W--until a
court stopped them. Now the county is party to bringing a lawsuit
against itself to block a measure that the voters approved.</TE>
<TE>   Don't try to understand the logic behind the county being on both
sides of a lawsuit. It is more of the absurd continuing waste of
taxpayer money over the proposed El Toro airport. At a minimum, the
county should resign from the authority.</TE>
<TE>   The authority's member cities are Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa,
Cypress, Garden Grove, La Habra, Los Alamitos, Newport Beach,
Placentia, Seal Beach, Stanton, Villa Park, Westminster and Yorba
Linda. It still supports an expensive staff and continues to promote
an unneeded second county airport. Residents should insist that their
city councils not provide tax money to the organization and withdraw
their memberships.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toll roads don't pay for themselves. Maintenance is the taxpayers'
burden.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans estimates that replacing 36 of the 39 existing filter
systems on the San Joaquin Hills tollway with the test systems will
cost $13.3 million. This will be paid for by taxpayers, not by tolls.
At the same time, they want to repair bumps on the Foothill/Eastern.
What will these repairs cost?</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Tom Wilson still wants the extension of the Foothill
South. This 16-mile extension is projected to dump into Interstate 5
at San Onofre State Beach. It will need filters to be legal. Will
Orange County taxpayers face millions of dollars in filter repairs
every season we have storms? Or will we just let the ocean ecosystem
die? Toll roads don't work. It's time to make our politicians face
this.</LD>

<LD>Re "Fear of Fish Odor Could Halt O.C. Water Project," April 3:</LD>
<LD>   I received a letter in the mail regarding the draining of the
Santiago Pits in Orange. Shortly thereafter I read the article in the
Los Angeles Times, "Fear of Fish Odor Could Halt O.C. Water Project,"
and I was astounded by what seemed to be taking shape here.</LD>
<LD>   I live a few miles from what will be the Santiago Pits project and
I can attest that any odor from the pits will be intolerable and
unacceptable. If the project continues, this will a long, hot, smelly
summer. I am glad to know that Denis Bilodeau, a board member of the
Orange County Water District, is looking out for his region. Without
Bilodeau's help I don't think the water board would be doing what is
right for the residents of Orange and Villa Park.</LD>

Bilodeau for speaking out and representing the residents.</TE>

Santiago Pits, and I am concerned about the effects of this project
on me and my kids. Only Denis Bilodeau seems to care about what will
happen to my neighborhood. The water board made this decision without
getting the facts, and I don't think it is right to burden my family
with the stench of dead fish for up to eight months.</TE>
<TE>   I support Bilodeau's attempt to halt this project until more
information becomes available.</TE>

<TE>   There is something fishy going on at the Orange County Water
District. The staff was more concerned about getting a pumping
station installed than subjecting the residents of Orange and Villa
Park to the smell of rotting fish for eight months. It's a good thing
board member Denis Bilodeau, who represents Orange and Villa Park,
got a whiff of what the staff had planned and put a stop to it. I
hope the district staff understand Bilodeau's message that the
effects on residents must be considered.</TE>

the planning should be stopped until they have a better idea of what

housing market the way it is, I have had a hard time.</TE>
<TE>   The project should be halted. It sounds to me like these people
have no idea what they are doing. One person says it will stink to
high heaven for two weeks; another person says it could be eight

<LD>Re "A Sewage Plume Comeback," April 4:</LD>
<LD>   Thanks for shining light on one solution to Huntington Beach's
1999 "mystery." We now have evidence from scientists at UC Irvine and
Scripps Institute of Oceanography that could explain how the Orange
County Sanitation District's partially treated sewage plume reached
the beach. The recent paper in Environmental Science and Technology
examines shoreward transport of bacteria driven by internal waves and
tides.</LD>
<LD>   No one sees the bugs directly, but it's clear that cold,
subthermocline water layers harboring the offshore plume are
connected with the same temperature layers running up and breaking
near the beach. A second point made by the authors is that although
urban runoff and marsh birds also have been linked in some studies,
"it is difficult to explain the observed spatial and temporal
variability based on these sources."</LD>
<TE>   Looking for urban runoff to explain all contamination is a
diversion from the apparent facts. A preliminary plume-modeling
report done for the district in 1997 predicted the presence of a
plume in shallow, near-shore waters, a fact demonstrated by district
monitoring on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>   The study pointed to the possibility of wind-driven upwelling and
downwelling that could serve as important transport processes. As the
Environmental Science and Technology article notes, upwelling reduces
water-column stability and could explain some of the contamination
events. This process has not yet been studied, but it should be
pointed out that the summer of 1999 was part of a La Nina year, in
which surface temperatures were unusually cool (lowering stability)
and strong westerlies blew surface waters offshore (at a 45-degree
angle to the wind), enhancing coastal upwelling. Hmm....Could further
study help to resolve the "mystery"?</TE>

<LD>Re "Flushing Away a Resource," editorial, April 8:</LD>
<LD>   We are all fortunate to live in a community where bodily waste
products are removed from our presence by the mere flick of a lever.
People in many parts of the world do not enjoy this sanitary
convenience. Current plumbing codes require toilets that use only 1.6
gallons of water per flush. Older toilets use at least 31/2 gallons
of water, and some more than 5 gallons. The use of "ultra-low-flow"
toilets saves millions of gallons of water daily. People who whine
about having to flush twice should do the math. Even double flushing
of a modern toilet uses less water than the older models.</LD>

<LD>Re "Teaching Young People Safe X Beats Just Saying No," commentary,
April 10</LD>
<LD>   I was appalled when I read Julie Holland's suggestion regarding
safe drug use. That she is a parent and a psychiatrist is an even
more horrifying thought.</LD>
<LD>   I would be the first to agree with her that our children don't
always do what we want them do.</LD>
<TE>   However, to advocate educated drug use is unconscionable,
dangerous and irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   It is ridiculous to believe that a teen under the influence of any
drug is going to have the presence of mind to drink a pint of water
every hour, or to have the judgment to avoid alcohol while he or she
is intoxicated by another drug.</TE>
<TE>   It is utterly naive to think that an inebriated teen is going to
have the knowledge or sense to "test the contents" of any drug.</TE>
<TE>   She also suggests that our teens' sex and driving "should be
deferred until sober."</TE>
<TE>   Even adults under the influence of these drugs (including alcohol)
make poor judgments about sex and driving, so how can we expect our
teens to make better judgments?</TE>
<TE>   As the parent of a teen who suffered severe brain damage from an
accidental drug overdose, I resent Holland's suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   If she wants to prevent teen death from drug use, she should
recruit people like my daughter to teach other teens the dangers of
drugs. My daughter has spoken to The Times, NBC, Teen, Elle Magazine,
MTV, Channel One and 20/20, in her attempt to prevent other teens
from suffering the devastating effects of drug use. She has spoken to
hundreds of teens, and they are listening and learning. Ms. Holland's
article is more than naive. It is a disservice to teens and their
parents, and I regret that The Times printed it.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S.'s Broken Promises Hurt Quality of Schools," Letters, April
14:</LD>
<LD>   The argument by John F. Dean, Orange County's superintendent of
schools, emeritus, that educating children with special needs is
costing public school students $89 million may be politically
expedient, but it also is divisive and somewhat specious. He fails to
recognize that children with special needs are, in fact, public
school students who are entitled to an equal education. His comment
"no one denies that children with special needs will be better served
when they are educated" would be soundly decried if "special needs"
were replaced by a reference to a student's ethnicity, economic
status or some other discriminatory title.</LD>
<LD>   Further, he suggests that many privileges, including Advanced
Placement classes, are lost to 90% of students because of the cost of
special education. What percentage of students is enrolled in AP
classes? Certainly not 90%. However, I doubt that anyone would
suggest that offering "special" classes for the academically elite
has a negative impact on the budget available for serving public
school students.</LD>
<TE>   I do not disagree that the federal government should ante up the
40% it promised to deliver in 1975. However, the federal government
frequently passes legislation that it never fully funds. It is not
just the federal government that is guilty of failing to adequately
support public schools. Certainly, state and local communities also
have been guilty of lack of support.</TE>
<TE>   The broader issue is scapegoating. Rather than separating out
special education as the villain in the budget shortfall, public
school officials need to focus on the needs of all public school
students and programs. Public schools are the foundation on which our
society is built. They should be regarded and funded as such.</TE>

<HD>Budget Pain? Depends on Who Is Injured</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Budget Remedies Could Hurt O.C.," April 14:</LD>
<LD>   Steven B. Frates makes some solid points on the effects of the
state's budget shortfall on Orange County, but it is unclear to me if
he is seeking culpability in our state's governing bodies, seeking
real solutions or is a tax cut advocate setting the stage for another
fiscal assault on public services.</LD>
<LD>   Now, let's be very clear. Collecting taxes and distributing the
revenue are two of the most vexing functions of government. It
requires extraordinary attention to detail in planning for the future
of our state. With countless civic groups, departments and agencies
vying for a piece of the action, spending the revenue also means
turning a deaf ear to well-heeled lobbyists flooding the statehouse
with money to support their causes.</LD>
<TE>   That brings up Frates' observation on the recent pay increase for
prison guards, a surprise that raised more than a few eyebrows around
the state.</TE>
<TE>   I do know with absolute certainty that the salaries for teachers,
firefighters and cops, to name a few groups of selfless public
servants, have been hammered for decades, in large measure by tax
cuts. Also, too many schools, hospitals and trauma centers are
crumbling or closing down from the fallout of tax-cut mania.</TE>
<TE>   How deeply the budget shortfall tests Orange County's threshold of
pain will depend on many factors. More than likely, it will continue
to be a case of whose ox is being gored.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ohman</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frates' commentary on Orange County's budget problems aptly
reveals a clear example of the do-nothing ways of most of the
county's elected representatives. Because of our legislators' benign
neglect, our schools, police and fire protection and infrastructure
have suffered. And now with recent redistricting, the impotency will
spread to Los Angeles County. Look out, Long Beach. Your pocket is
about to be picked.</TE>

<LD>   If we needed more evidence for the proposition that the level of
environmentalism has been raised to that of a cult, the six mice
living on the Dana Point Headlands should surely suffice. There is
little rational about giving up property worth millions to save a
creature--which is still in plentiful supply just a few miles to the

<HD>O.C. Set to Buy Tollway Along 91</HD>
<DH>Transit: Agency agrees to pay the private operator $207
million for the Express Lanes. Board will vote Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County transportation officials have struck a deal to buy the
controversial 91 Express Lanes in a bid to speed improvements on the
chronically congested Riverside Freeway linking Orange, Los Angeles
and Riverside counties.</LD>
<LD>   Under the deal reached Friday, the Orange County Transportation
Authority would pay California Private Transportation Co. $207.5
million for the 10 miles of toll lanes running from Riverside County
to the Costa Mesa Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The OCTA board of directors will consider the deal in a closed
session Monday. Board Chairman Todd Spitzer and director Michael Ward
said Saturday that the deal is likely to pass.</LD>
<TE>   Toll road officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Express Lanes, which opened in 1996, have provided relief for
commuters, but the project has come under fire because of a
noncompete clause, which prohibits public transportation agencies
from adding lanes or improving the freeway without compensating the
company.</TE>
<TE>   The company sued in 1999 when Caltrans tried to add lanes to a
stretch of the freeway, which it contended would divert customers
from the toll lanes. Later, Riverside County sued the private
operator, saying the agreement with the state was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "You have lawsuits going back and forth and meanwhile drivers are
sitting on those lanes unable to move," Ward, an Irvine councilman,
said Saturday. "This breaks the logjam."</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Ward, then OCTA chairman, sought ways to reduce
congestion on the Riverside Freeway, a major commuter route for the
rapidly growing Inland Empire. The noncompete clause, however, made
improvements costly.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, OCTA agreed to pay $4 million in public funds
to California Private Transportation for the right to ease a
bottleneck along a 1,000-yard stretch of freeway just east of Coal
Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA began negotiating in December to buy the toll lanes, which
cost about $135 million to build, in the early 1990s. Spitzer said
$207.5 million is a fair price to turn the lanes back into public
hands.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like buying a house," said Spitzer, who is running for the
state Assembly in a district that lies mainly in Riverside County.
"You don't get to buy houses for what people paid for them 10 years
ago....</TE>
<TE>   "If we had to go out today and build that road ourselves, it's
equivalent to what we're paying."</TE>
<TE>   An earlier effort to buy the tollway by a nonprofit agency died
over the $274-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Ward and Spitzer said buying the turnpike was a better alternative
than doling out millions to the company for every improvement
project. Spitzer said 250,000 vehicles use the freeway each day.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do something about it today, then there is no hope
... given the amount of growth that's happening in the Inland
Empire," Spitzer said. "It will be good for commuters.... People will
see dramatic improvements over time."</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, OCTA will assume the toll road's $135-million
debt and make a one-time payment of $72.5 million, which includes the
$4 million OCTA agreed to pay in January for the improvement near
Coal Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature must still grant OCTA approval to charge
commuters a toll. OCTA officials said they plan to begin lobbying the
Legislature next week.</TE>
<TE>   If the purchase goes through, OCTA officials said they will look
into lowering tolls, now about $8 for a round trip during rush hour,
and making the Express Lanes free for carpoolers with more than three
people per vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer also said the OCTA purchase would free up funds from an
upcoming Riverside County ballot measure to spend $498 million on
freeway improvements, which is contingent on the noncompete clause
being eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The protection clauses were built into contracts negotiated
between the state and private road developers more than a decade ago,
when California lacked funds for transportation projects. Private
operators argued that freeway improvements would take customers from
the toll roads, so they needed to protect their investments.</TE>
<TE>   The protection clause for the 91 Express Lanes covers 30 miles,
from the border of Los Angeles and Orange counties to Interstate 15
in Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County transportation officials face similar clauses with
the Eastern, Foothill and the San Joaquin Hills toll roads, all
operated by private companies.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said Saturday they had no plans to buy more private
roads.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the transit authority tried to have the state buy
all four toll roads including the 91 Express Lanes, but the
$3.5-billion price tag was too high.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said having a public agency run the toll roads will
benefit commuters.</TE>
<TE>   The private operator's "goal was to maximize profit," he said.
"Our goal at OCTA would be to maximize mobility, maximize the number
of vehicles that are able to use those toll lanes."</TE>

<CX>   Express Lane--An article in the April 21 California section about
the Riverside Freeway's privately run express lanes incorrectly described
the agencies that operate Orange County's other toll roads. The San

<HD>Dancing to Miss Barstow's Misstep</HD>
<DH>Theater: Students craft a musical based on the beauty
queen's loss of her crown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>First there was "Evita," the hit musical drawn from headlines about
Eva Peron of Argentina. Then the Broadway production of "Titanic."
And now there's the true-life tale of ... Miss Barstow?</LD>
<LD>   "Hot Off the Press: The Romance of the Kissimmee Queen" is a
whimsical production written and staged by San Diego high school
theater students who were enchanted by news stories last year about
the teenager who lost her beauty queen crown after pulling a prank on
a classmate.</LD>
<LD>   "Every year we do this play, and usually it's some crazy story
that could never really happen," said 18-year-old Michael Slaughter,
still slightly out of breath from rehearsing one of the show's big
dance numbers. "But this year, the crazy story really did happen."</LD>
<TE>   Since September, the 75 seniors participating in Point Loma High
School's musical have crammed into the school's theater to hammer out
a script detailing the rise and fall of Emily Arnold, Miss Barstow
2001.</TE>
<TE>   The story recounts (with a few embellishments, admittedly)
Arnold's struggle to win the crown--including juicy details like her
last-minute scramble to buy a slightly gaudy gold evening gown at
Sears, the only store in town with a generator the night a blackout
hit.</TE>
<TE>   And it tells how, after winning the contest, Arnold unknowingly
risked it all during a night of senior fun when she used a piece of
chalk to scrawl the words "NOT NICE" and "MEAN" on a car outside a
rival classmate's house.</TE>
<TE>   Although the chalk was easily wiped off, the classmate's father--a
California Highway Patrol sergeant--caught Arnold in the act, called
for backup, and had the girl and six of her friends arrested on
suspicion of vandalism.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal swept through Barstow, and ended only when Arnold
agreed to return her crown.</TE>
<TE>   News accounts of the story caught the eye of Point Loma High
theater teacher Larry Zeiger. Even though the story unfolded in early
summer, well before the school year began, "I knew already: This,
this is the story that would become my 26th play.... It's got
everything: small-town Americana, a beauty pageant, wonderful
conflict, drama, satire."</TE>
<TE>   When he finally read Arnold's saga to his students, they loved it
too.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite part had to be the words 'Mean' and 'Not Nice,'" said
Slaughter, who plays a reporter hot on the trail of the story. "I
heard that and thought: Are you kidding me? It's so ridiculous how
people could become so upset over those words. That was the hook."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in this class has TP'd [toilet-papered] a house and
written stuff in chalk as a prank," added 18-year-old Megan Nimura.
"And to get arrested for that? It's just hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   The musical has two acts. The first stays pretty close to actual
events, though names and places have been tweaked "to keep us from
getting sued," Zeiger said.</TE>
<TE>   The story, for example, takes place in Kissimmee, Fla. And the
title-holder, named Felicity in the show, is actually not a beauty
queen. She's a dancing queen--a change introduced so the production
could use a song by that name from the 1970s-era pop band ABBA.</TE>
<TE>   The second act gets a little more creative with the facts, sending
Felicity on an adventure out West rather than turning in her crown.
Along the way, a magic curse turns her boyfriend into a bat, she
joins the circus and ends up winning a trillion-dollar lottery. None
of that happened, of course, to the real Miss Barstow.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I had to do something to fit in the whole cast," said
Zeiger, motioning to the 50 or so students milling about during one
rehearsal afternoon. Zeiger also had to figure out a way to work in
all the songs the students wanted, which, in addition to a couple of
ABBA numbers, include "Go West" from the Village People and "I Feel
Pretty" from "West Side Story."</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult task, however, was deciding who would play the
queen. Competition was stiff, the students said. Ten girls gave it
their best shots, but ultimately the honor went to 17-year-old
Shannon Wicks. Even though it's a musical, Wicks says she can't sing
a note.</TE>
<TE>   As for the real Emily Arnold--who is, ironically, a theater
student herself at a community college in Arizona--she squealed in
delight at hearing that her story had inspired a musical.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I think it's awesome," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She has just one word of advice to those portraying her life
story. "Just please, be nice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Hot Off the Press: The Romance of the Kissimmee Queen" runs May
17, 18, 23, 24, 25, 30 and 31 at Point Loma High School, 2335

<DH>Landmark: The design awards that Mission Viejo's
Autohandwash won didn't mean owner could pay loan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the owner of a freeway-hugging carwash, Ed Komski was living a
charmed life.</LD>
<LD>   His chic, feng shui-inspired Mission Viejo Autohandwash beat mega
projects all over the West to win the prestigious Gold Nugget award
from the Western Building Show in San Francisco in 1997. Judges
praised the design as an inspired model of "high architectural
style."</LD>
<LD>   Newspapers and magazines splashed photos of him and the
building--designed by Bundy/Finkel Architects of Santa Ana--across
their pages. The phone began ringing with corporate consultants
wanting advice.</LD>
<TE>   A few months later, El Nino struck. Business came to a near halt.
The rainstorms were followed by competitors opening carwashes nearby,
increasing the pressure on the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Komski says things were finally starting to look up when the fatal
blow came: The Small Business Administration had sold to a private
financial group the $750,000 loan on which he had fallen behind in
payments. The SBA staff was out of the picture and foreclosure
loomed.</TE>
<TE>   In a few months, a Krispy Kreme Doughnuts franchise will open
where the carwash is now being torn down. All that will be left of
the Autohandwash is the imitation gold nugget and plaque awarded
Komski, and a lot of legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   Already bankrupt and unemployed, Komski said his troubles keep
compounding. He's now being sued for $1.1 million--the remaining
amount of the 20-year SBA loan, with interest--by the out-of-state
financial consortium CFSC, which bought the loan.</TE>
<TE>   The loan was sold as part of a much-heralded federal program in
which SBA auctions off its assets to private financial groups,
sometimes without warning borrowers. The sales of loans, some in
default and others not, have raised billions to jump-start new small
businesses, but they also send fledgling entrepreneurs into the hands
of bottom-line-driven lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The SBA had offered counseling, marketing help and loan
restructuring to Komski, who was more than a year behind in his
payments.</TE>
<TE>   CFSC demanded immediate payment.</TE>
<TE>   "The loan sale program is a double-edged sword," said Raphael
Bostic, an associate professor of real estate at USC and an expert in
small-business loans. "SBA is handing over loans to companies that
don't have the same mission it does, which is to have businesses
survive."</TE>
<TE>   CFSC took over Komski's loan, along with more than 4,000 others as
part of the government's first loan sale in 1999. The package was
worth $332 million plus tens of millions more in interest. A third of
the borrowers, like Komski, were already in default, so the company
was able to get the entire group of loans for $195 million.</TE>
<TE>   Financing Attempt Doesn't Work Out</TE>
<TE>   Soon afterward, Komski lined up a private investor willing to take
over his loan for a price close to what CFSC paid, but the consortium
demanded the entire $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Without my knowledge, the SBA just sold my loan to a private
consortium I never would have been able to get money from in the
first place," Komski said. SBA officials said their loan contract did
not require them to consult Komski about the sale.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for CFSC said Komski merely gambled with taxpayers'
money and lost and now must be held accountable. "The business was
well on its way to failure by the time CFSC got the loan," said the
attorney, Edward Treder. "All reasonable efforts to get him back on
track had already been exhausted by the SBA..... There is a point at
which government agencies have to mitigate their loss and protect the
interests of the taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Komski looked on recently as the wrecking crew crushed pipes,
hacked away at the walls and began to pull the foundation out of the
ground. "People need to realize that their relationship with the
government may have a time bomb attached to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His resume is up on the Internet and he has been hunting for a
banking job while he fights his creditors in court.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no large-scale revolt against the loan sales.
Small-business lobbying groups largely embraced them because they
have created billions in seed money for entrepreneurs. About 110,000
loans have been turned over to private bidders, bringing $2.7 billion
to the U.S. Treasury.</TE>
<TE>   But some business owners have taken to calling the transferred
loans "vulture funds," charging that financial groups buy in at a
discount so they can seize assets from troubled firms.</TE>
<TE>   The risk CFSC took in taking over Komski's loan was high, but so
were the potential rewards. The site, after all, can be seen from
Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium was required to abide by the same loan contract as
the SBA. But while the government worked with Komski when he couldn't
make the $7,000 monthly payments, the new company was less forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   CFSC's move to foreclose triggered the same move from Community
Bank, which was the primary lender to the business and had given
Komski a separate $1.38-million loan. Komski had managed to keep the
$13,000 monthly payment on that loan current.</TE>
<TE>   Property Is Sold and Owner Is Sued for Note</TE>
<TE>   The lenders raced to the courthouse and CFSC lost; Community Bank
got possession of the property and sold it. So CFSC is suing Komski
and a family member who guaranteed his loan for the $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials say the program has safeguards to ensure that
the companies that take over the loans don't merely foreclose and
liquidate assets. But if the borrower falls behind in payments, the
companies have a right to move in--even when the SBA probably would
not.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the massive number of loans we have sold, we have had very
few complaints about these being 'vulture funds,'" said Richard
Blewett, director of the SBA Asset Sale Program.</TE>
<TE>   "These are large institutions buying these loans for cash-flow
reasons. They are not fly-by-night operations."</TE>
<TE>   Blewett said the SBA is scheduling two or three more loan sales a
year for at least the next few years. He said part of SBA's mission
is to collect on loans so there is more money for new loans. That
includes selling loans to companies to get the cash.</TE>
<TE>   "We do as much as we can, but at some point these loans must be
repaid," he said. "We have a responsibility to the taxpayers."</TE>

<HD>When Trail Goes Cold, Homicide Unit Turns Up Heat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps the only thing that stood out about "Jane Doe No. 53" was her
unusual outfit--a baby blue, homemade "candy striper" dress and a
pair of worn, black shoes.</LD>
<LD>   There were no fingerprints to check or any relatives or friends to
claim her body in 1987 when her body was discovered bound and
decomposed in the dense vegetation along Burbank Boulevard in the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   It did not help that the original investigators had washed the
victim's dress, destroying a wealth of potential DNA evidence.</LD>
<TE>   With little to go on and no obvious suspects, the unidentified
twentysomething woman joined legions of other homicide victims--some
anonymous, some identified--who faded into the yellowing pages of the
Los Angeles Police Department's murder books.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the years since the "cold cases" were last pursued, they
are receiving fresh attention from a new LAPD unit that uses modern
technology, including tracking software, DNA evidence and databanks
of fingerprints and ballistics records, to try to solve old crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But even as it gets off the ground, the cold-case unit is
threatened by a shortage of criminalists who review evidence and a
rising crime rate that has some questioning why seasoned detectives
are being used to solve old cases when new ones need attention.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter to a third of all murders in the city go unsolved
in any given year, according to authorities, leaving 8,300 cold-case
slayings dating back four decades.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA historian Eric Monkonnen, who is compiling a history of
homicides in Los Angeles, said the unit is important not just because
it will solve crimes but because of what it says about police
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Cold cases are a much larger side of the justice system,"
Monkonnen said. "It's more expensive and less glamorous, but if we
don't do it, it says our society is cynical and in a way,
superficial."</TE>
<TE>   Created with the help of LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks, Robbery
Homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau and Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Stephen
Cooley, the nine-member team of LAPD detectives was formed in
November. Led by Det. Dave Lambkin, a 25-year homicide detective, the
unit spent its formative months revisiting murders that occurred from
1960 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   From their cramped quarters on the third floor of Parker Center,
the detectives said their unique jobs make them part cops, part
historians and part scientists.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Jane Doe No. 53, the first priority of LAPD Dets.
Vivian Flores and Richard Bengtson is to find the dead woman's family
in the absence of the most basic forensic clues.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are her fingerprints unusable, her dental records cannot
be tracked down until family members come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Luck also plays a role in solving old cases. In a recent
investigation involving the 1984 "road rage" stabbing of a man in the
Rampart district, police searched for the lone witness for more than
four years. Flores and Bengtson got a break in February when they ran
his name through a Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license
database. The witness, who frequently traveled between Los Angeles
and El Salvador, had just renewed his license.</TE>
<TE>   The new information put detectives on the trail of the man they
believe is the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Police and prosecutors believe there are 1,300 solvable cases in
the system, including more than 300 sexually motivated crimes
eligible for DNA analysis under a three-year state grant.</TE>
<TE>   The $50-million "cold-hit program" covers the costs of examining
DNA in sexually motivated cases by allowing detectives to access a
state database containing 210,000 DNA samples. Hundreds of thousands
of additional genetic samples also are available through FBI
databases.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the passage of time can be helpful to detectives,
Lambkin said. Relationships change, and re-interviewing ex-spouses,
girlfriends or acquaintances "can make someone feel enough removed
that they may be willing to talk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everything works seamlessly when revisiting aging
investigations. "As the information gets old, things get lost,"
Lambkin said. "Detectives keep a lot of information in their head.
Not everything can be committed to paper."</TE>
<TE>   Killings from the 1960s and '70s seldom yield usable genetic
evidence, but quality and quantity improve significantly in cases
from the 1980s and '90s, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the physical deficiencies of old cases, detectives
have to contend with internal pressure from commanders pressing to
put experienced detectives in the field as homicides rise.</TE>
<TE>   Many LAPD officials are concerned that the city will experience a
repeat of the late 1980s and early '90s when the homicide rate
soared, reaching a record high of 1,096 in 1992. It dropped to a
30-year low of 425 in 1999 but surged again last year to 584,
according to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau and others instrumental in creating the unit say they are
committed to keeping the nine detectives where they are. "We said
they are going to be a unit to investigate cold cases, and that's
what they are going to do," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   The program's success will hinge on a commitment by the city and
county to pay for investigators, prosecutors and criminalists.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past decade we've had the advanced forensic tools to
solve these suspect-less homicides," said Los Angeles County Deputy
Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, who heads the forensic science division. "This
is the time to take advantage of those techniques to solve these
cases."</TE>
<TE>   Laboratories run by the LAPD and the Sheriff's Department are
short on staff and overwhelmed by a backlog of thousands of unsolved
cases. Between the two agencies, there are at least 3,700 untested
blood and semen samples from rape cases alone. Many of them date to
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Although both agencies say they have preserved biological evidence
for about 2,000 unsolved rapes and slayings involving sexual
offenses, Kahn estimates that they should have evidence for about
6,000.</TE>

<HD>Crash at Air Show Kills 2</HD>
<DH>Accident: Navy jet slams into the ground, killing the pilot
and navigator as thousands of spectators watch.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Navy jet crashed at the Point Mugu Air Show on Saturday, killing
its pilot and navigator as thousands of horrified spectators watched.
The impact shook the earth and a fireball sent heat sweeping across
their faces.</LD>
<LD>   No one on the ground was injured as the QF-4 Phantom peeled away
from its low-flying formation and dived into a marshy area just west
of the base.</LD>
<LD>   Observers saw flames come from one of the jet's engines seconds
before crashing, but no cause for the accident has been determined.
An official close to the investigation said a mechanical malfunction
was likely to blame.</LD>
<TE>   The annual air show, which in the past has drawn as many as
300,000 spectators over three days, shut down after the 12:20 p.m.
crash. The events planned for Sunday, the show's last day, were
canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot was identified as Navy Cmdr. Michael Norman, 39, and the
navigator was Marine Capt. Andrew Muhs, 31. Partners for some time,
the two were assigned to Naval Base Ventura County's weapons test
squadron.</TE>
<TE>   "Both were fine pilots and fine gentlemen," said Capt. Jim
Rainwater, the base's commanding officer.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred as the Vietnam-era jet was completing a
performance along with three other fighter aircraft--two F14 Tomcats
and another QF-4 Phantom. As the four jets thundered just 500 feet
above the runway in a diamond-shaped formation, they began to slow
down, banking to the right in preparation for landing.</TE>
<TE>   That's when white smoke and flames spewed from an engine of one
QF-4. The jet wobbled out of control before slamming into privately
owned wetlands that are used as a duck hunting preserve. Observers
then saw a fireball burst 300 feet into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the planes] were all turning, and the last one just peeled
off with a big flame," said Mike Embry of Thousand Oaks. "When I saw
the flames, I knew he was going down."</TE>
<TE>   Moments before, air show announcer Gordon Bowman Jones was urging
the audience to cheer on the pilots as they roared past. After the
crash, he quickly called for calm among the onlookers, who were
stunned as dozens of military personnel toting automatic weapons ran
toward the crash site and at least six base firetrucks sped across
the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the pilots are OK," Jones told the crowd. "If you have
children, try to talk to them about what they've just seen."</TE>
<TE>   Holding his 3-year-old daughter, Ventura resident Jerry Davis did
just that. He later said he wasn't sure how to explain the
catastrophe they had just witnessed. "I told my daughter that
sometimes accidents just happen. I said a little prayer to God for
those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people raced to the runway fence line as a thick cloud
of smoke curled up from the crash. Others sat numbly in their lawn
chairs. Silence swept the crowd as the Sousa marches that had been
blaring from loudspeakers were turned off. Even before the show was
officially canceled, families walked hurriedly past dozens of
concession booths and toward the parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred two hours into the show, which features private
pilots doing stunts and precision military pilots performing
high-risk maneuvers. Among those who did not get to appear Saturday
were the Air Force's renowned Thunderbirds, who were to be the show's
main draw this year.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions appeared ideal. The weather was clear and the
temperatures cool. Officials said they were anticipating a record
turnout, prompted partly by a post-Sept. 11 surge of patriotic
fervor.</TE>
<TE>   Security forces had been doubled since last year, with about 500
personnel checking bags and coolers as spectators filed into the show
through a single entrance. Troops in full battlefield garb walked
among suburbanites hauling lawn chairs and blankets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already tense around here with all of the extra security,
and then this happens," said spectator Brandon Willard of Acton. "The
weather couldn't have been better today, but this is like a rain
cloud."</TE>
<TE>   Don Lewis, the show's director and a former Navy pilot stationed
at Point Mugu, was nearly brought to tears by what he saw from the
viewing stand. This was the first fatal crash in the show's 39 years,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, tragedy comes with the territory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an air show and this is an accepted part of the risk," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Norman left active duty and joined the reserves
in order to try his hand at acting, said air show director Don Lewis,
a friend for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to active duty, he was a Navy flight instructor in Texas
before taking his position at Point Mugu.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wonderful gentleman," Lewis said. "Ask anyone and
they'll tell you the same."</TE>
<TE>   Little information was immediately released about Muhs. His
nickname as a pilot was "Mutt" and Norman's was "Storm."</TE>
<TE>   The jet that crashed is one of a vanishing breed that was used
extensively in the 1960s and '70s. Known then as the F-4, it is now
housed only at Naval Base Ventura County. Because it is used as a
training plane and as an aide in targeting the missiles tested at
Point Mugu, its technical designation is QF-4, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Aerobatics Are High Point of Air Shows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stunt plane spun out of control at an air show in Upland in early
2000. The pilot died after the plane spiraled to the ground and burst
into flames.</LD>
<LD>   Later that year, a military plane performing a landing maneuver at
the Sounds of Freedom air show crashed to the ground 15 miles north
of Philadelphia, killing two.</LD>
<LD>   And on Saturday afternoon, a low-flying QF-4 Phantom II jet
crashed just west of the Point Mugu Navy base, far from spectators.
Both crew members were killed.</LD>
<TE>   These air shows, and scores of others across the country, carry an
aura of both excitement and danger, as exhilarated spectators cheer
on pilots performing ground-shaking, gravity-defying maneuvers.
Whether it's high-tech jets or antique aircraft, aerobatics are
typically the high point of a day at the air show.</TE>
<TE>   Former National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall
likens it to the thrill of a NASCAR race. "The people who participate
in air shows are a lot like stock-car racers," Hall said. "They
understand the risks. And just like NASCAR, where you are going to
have spectators when you are doing unusual maneuvers and high speeds,
there needs to be safeguards because it is going to be dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Hall said that during his tenure, the agency investigated crashes
at several air shows, prompting renewed vigilance and enforcement of
FAA regulations, including adherence to strict guidelines on audience
setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows,
said that in part because of those FAA regulations, created with the
air show industry more than 50 years ago, no spectator has been
killed at an American air show since 1952. "There is sometimes a
perception that air show accidents are more common and serious than
they truly are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of a year, Cudahy said, there are more than 325
air shows and only a handful of accidents. Last year, he said, there
was not a single fatal air show accident in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Air shows across the nation draw millions of spectators annually
to both country airfields and sprawling military bases. A whole
industry of promoters, performers, announcers and concessionaires is
in place to support the popular attractions, which typically roll out
from March through November.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said a well-run air show is a safe event that caters to the
public's fascination with flying machines. Performers, he said, must
put safety over acrobatics.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern has always been not to take unnecessary risks that
could hurt people on the ground," he said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Man Held in Death of Police Dog</HD>
<DH>Crime: Canine stabbed while helping subdue suspect who
allegedly threatened an officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old Oxnard man was in custody Saturday in the stabbing
death of an Oxnard police dog.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Paul Knight was booked into Ventura County Jail as a
suspect on a variety of charges stemming from an incident Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Knight allegedly stabbed 4-year-old Rudy as the dog tried to
subdue him during a confrontation with an Oxnard police officer. Rudy
was taken to an emergency pet hospital, where he was declared dead.</LD>
<TE>   "It's more than just a dog dying," Cmdr. Scott Whitney said. "He
was obviously part of the team and he died protecting his partner.
The guys are really down."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the incident began about 6:35 p.m. Friday when an
officer stopped a vehicle on suspected traffic violations. The
driver, who police identified as Knight, ran into his family's home
in the 1700 block of Tehama Street, knocked down his grandmother and
left through another door. The officer called for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Officer J.R. Perez, who was on patrol with Rudy, stopped a car in
which the suspect was then reported riding. Police said Knight got
out and taunted Perez with a knife, refusing to drop the weapon. As
Knight started to run away, Perez told Rudy to subdue him.</TE>
<TE>   Knight was treated for dog bites at Ventura County Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Police said he was wanted on suspicion of violating his probation.
In addition to killing the dog, he faces charges of brandishing a
deadly weapon at a police officer and resisting arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy was a Belgian Malinois who received his initial training in
Europe. He was particularly good with children, a police spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy's was the department's first canine death, police said.</TE>

<HD>El Toro Deal at Risk Over Park Funding</HD>
<DH>Land use: State law prohibits Irvine from making good on
its promise to give tax proceeds to other cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deal to give Irvine control of the closed El Toro Marine base could
unravel because state law prohibits a plan to use tax dollars
generated by the base for parks elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad, who cast the swing vote
last week for Irvine's bid to annex most of the 4,700-acre base, said
if she doesn't get the promised funds for parks in her district she
will oppose Irvine's annexation application.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement struck by the county and the city calls for Irvine
to divert property taxes from future development of the base to pay
for new parks in north Orange County--up to $800,000 a year,
according to Coad. But state law limits spending taxes from a
redevelopment zone--the designation Irvine plans to give the
property.</LD>
<TE>   Major changes in redevelopment law passed by the Legislature in
1993 require that most property taxes generated by development at the
base go to Irvine's redevelopment agency. The funds could not be used
on outside areas. The law also bars any agreement between Irvine and
the county to share the tax money.</TE>
<TE>   State law also establishes a formula for the county's portion of
future tax proceeds from El Toro--an amount that would be only a
fraction of what Coad expected for county parks. The land generates
no taxes now because it is federal property.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the base's value rose $1 billion through
redevelopment, the county's portion of property taxes would be only
$150,000, far less than what Coad expected the county would receive.</TE>
<TE>   Parks Revenue Was Crucial for Coad's Vote</TE>
<TE>   Creating an annual revenue stream for park-poor North County was
crucial for her vote, said Coad, who lives in unincorporated West
Anaheim, where there is one acre of parkland per 100,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   She provided the pivotal third vote April 16 that would let Irvine
take control of El Toro. She joined Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom
Wilson. Supervisors Jim Silva and Chuck Smith voted no.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect to see something in writing in two weeks," Coad said
Friday of the $800,000 a year Irvine promised, an amount she hoped
would increase later. "It's up to them to find a way."</TE>
<TE>   This latest El Toro wrinkle comes at a sensitive time for Irvine,
which awaits an announcement Tuesday by the U.S. Navy on whether it
will sell the base to private buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine wants the Navy to hand over the property in exchange for a
portion of the sale of 440 acres at the base's southern edge to be
rezoned for 1,500 homes.</TE>
<TE>   On a separate track, a Marine commandant said Friday he might
recommend that the Navy delay its decision on the property until it
can study a proposal to move the Marines' West Coast boot camp from
San Diego to El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James L. Jones has suggested taking
1,300 acres at El Toro to move recruits from San Diego, where they
train on 388 acres next to San Diego's overcrowded international
airport. Doing so would require federal legislation, because the base
is closed.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors on April 16 voted unanimously to support a
training center at the base. Irvine has not taken a position on the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The city's redevelopment plan would be based on zoning approved by
county voters last month when they killed the county's plans to build
an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   However, the city needn't follow voter-approved zoning if it
annexes the base.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's bid to take control of the property rests on more than
the Navy's announcement Tuesday. The city must complete an
environmental and financial review justifying the annexation and
submit plans to the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission,
a state-created agency that oversees incorporations and annexations.
That would take five months, with the final commission vote expected
in January.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's quandary over finding money for North County parks comes
at a tense time for city finances. Property owners last week approved
a parcel tax that will generate $3.2 million a year to cover a
projected shortfall in paying for existing parks and street
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   And in November, Irvine residents will probably be asked to
approve a bond measure so its schools can reinstate smaller class
sizes in primary grades--after being the first district in the state
to abandon popular class-size reductions because of money woes.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials said Friday they are trying to put together a
plan to honor the financial promise to Coad--whether the money comes
from taxes or other sources. City Atty. Joel Kuperberg said he is
confident there is at least one legal mechanism for Irvine to provide
money for North County parks.</TE>
<TE>   "When the county's and city's lawyers sit down and know what they
want to accomplish, there's at least one way to accomplish it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate if this unravels," said Fred Smoller, who heads
the Henley Social Sciences Research Laboratory at Chapman University
in Orange. The center's last poll showed that parks and open space
are a major issue for North County residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Cynthia Coad obviously wants to leave a real legacy and to do the
right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer Wanted State Funds for North County</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who brokered the deal for Coad's vote, said he was
focused on his proposal to use part of the county's state park bond
money for North County--a one-time allocation of about $2 million for
Coad's Anaheim- and Fullerton-based district. Supervisors had been
leaning toward spending the money in park-rich South County.</TE>
<TE>   Coad suggested using property tax money, he said, which Irvine
officials didn't learn until she announced it at the board meeting.
"From my point, I thought the selling point was the [park bond]
money," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't consider the possibility that Irvine would
create a redevelopment agency that would consume the tax money.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said she wanted a way to guarantee annual park funding for
North County and settled on property tax growth. Now, Spitzer agreed,
the pressure is on Irvine to create a plan for delivering the money:
"If it doesn't happen, it's a deal-breaker."</TE>
<TE>   Two other problems exist: If supervisors agreed to earmark the
county's share of tax money--whatever the amount--for North County
parks, that agreement could be changed by any cash-strapped future
board. Irvine also is limited in the kinds of funds it might promise
the county in lieu of the base property tax because that could
constitute an illegal gift of public funds.</TE>
<TE>   The city could ask the Legislature to amend state law and allow
the tax money to be shared, but that would face opposition, said
Peter Detwiler, staff director of the Senate Local Government
Committee. "In general, it would be a difficult bill and take a lot
of legislative leadership to pull it off," Detwiler said.</TE>

<HD>FBI Targets Rings Staging Car Accidents</HD>
<DH>Crime: The agency is investigating lawyers, chiropractors
and others involved in swindling insurance companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a continuing crackdown on medical fraud in California, a major
target will be lawyers, chiropractors and others involved in staging
car accidents to swindle insurance companies, FBI officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Working with state insurance officials, agents say, they have
identified 400 lawyers and chiropractors in Southern California who
are involved in that type of fraudulent activity, and at least twice
as many statewide.</LD>
<LD>   Nationally, one in three car wrecks results in an insurance claim,
officials say. In California, that rises to two out of three. In Los
Angeles, it is about 90%.</LD>
<TE>   FBI Agent Daniel Martino, head of health-care fraud investigations
in the Los Angeles area, said dozens of arrests have been made and
more are expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't call it an epidemic," Martino said, "but there is an
unbelievably large cadre of lawyers and chiropractors running these
operations."</TE>
<TE>   Auto fraud rings typically include a lawyer, a chiropractor and a
recruiter, or "capper," who enlists others who serve as drivers and
passengers or allow use of their cars, Martino said.</TE>
<TE>   One common staged accident is known as a "swoop and squat." One
driver suddenly swerves in front of an unsuspecting motorist and hits
the brakes. A second car blocks any side movement by the innocent
party, forcing a collision.</TE>
<TE>   During the past two years, as part of a broader crackdown on
health-care fraud in California, the FBI and state insurance
officials established operations in San Diego and Los Angeles to
investigate auto accident fraud rings.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego operation, dubbed Twisted Metal, resulted in 51
convictions. Those convicted of various fraud charges included five
chiropractors and seven lawyers and law office administrators.</TE>
<TE>   During the same time, the FBI launched a second operation, Bad
Faith, that used tax laws to go after lawyers, chiropractors and
other ring members for failing to report as income the kickbacks they
received.</TE>
<TE>   That operation, Martino said, has led to 27 more fraud and income
tax convictions, including seven chiropractors, seven lawyers, 11 law
office administrators and two medical office managers.</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Insurance has worked with the FBI on
its investigations over the last two years, and officials there agree
that auto accident fraud should remain a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ross, deputy commissioner of criminal investigations for the
department, said state and federal officials focus on staged
accidents because they can lead to injury and even death.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, an Orange County couple and their 2-year-old daughter
were killed in a staged accident on the Long Beach Freeway. Members
of an auto accident ring later were sentenced to 11 years in prison
on manslaughter charges in that crime.</TE>
<TE>   "That accident demonstrated that this particular kind of fraud
deserves special attention," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it is difficult to measure the amount that insurance
companies pay in fraudulent claims--and ultimately pass on to
consumers. "It's obviously a huge amount of money. Has to be in the
millions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He would be guessing, Ross added, if he tried to estimate how many
people on any given day are cruising the state's highways,
deliberately trying to cause a traffic accident so that they can
swindle an insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   "There are groups of people out there doing this," he said. "It's
like shooting fish in a barrel for them, finding places to stage
accidents. Innocent people get hurt."</TE>

<HD>Living-Room Diplomats Take Steps Toward Peace</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Wyle began a recent evening with the jaded optimism of a
lottery player who expects to lose, but plunks down his dollar
anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Ten people from diverse backgrounds were gathering in Wyle's
Irvine living room to talk about the things that separated
them--color and class, faith and family. The goal: to find a path to
peace and understanding in a world skewed by hatred and intolerance.</LD>
<LD>   The odds, Wyle admitted, were long.</LD>
<TE>   "One series like this, in one living room, doesn't mean anything,"
Wyle said, a plastic cup of soda in one hand as people filtered in
for the third and final "living room dialogue" he hosted with his
wife, Hilda.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we get hundreds of these [dialogues] in hundreds of living
rooms, then maybe one hothead will stand up sometime in the future
and one of his own people will say, 'Shut up and sit down,'" Wyle
said. "That would be marvelous."</TE>
<TE>   In the seven months since the Sept. 11 attacks, Southern
California and the nation have shared a nightmare of shock, grief,
anger and, in some quarters, a thirst for vengeance. These are the
reactions of a family dealing with sudden loss, with emotions
magnified on a national scale.</TE>
<TE>   But community activists say the attacks also have unleashed
people's pent-up desire to shed their cloaks of isolation and better
connect with their communities and the world.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers are devising strategies to capitalize on these
emotions, from the "living room dialogues" arranged by the Orange
County Human Relations Council to an upcoming social mixer at a Los
Angeles art gallery to entice young professionals to involve
themselves in community programs.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts include major grant-making foundations hoping to
advance tolerance of Arabs, Muslims and Sikhs.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we wanted to do was reach into communities and
support programs that focus around reducing hate and increasing
understanding--particularly understanding the culture of Arab
Americans and Muslims," said Gwen Foster, program director for the
California Endowment.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the endowment granted 15 organizations a total of $2.4
million to combat intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Because the goal is to affect attitudes and beliefs, success will
be hard to gauge.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be looking for indications that people are coming
together, that there is increased dialogue and reduced fearfulness
among people," Foster said. "How we measure that, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the programs make use of existing structures,
such as interfaith movements, others try new methods to draw people
in.</TE>
<TE>   The Wyles' sessions involved one Egyptian American, an Indian
American Sikh, two American Jews and a Japanese American Buddhist;
two representatives from the gay community; and 14-year-old Anson
Stewart, who runs a youth diversity program in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion covered how individuals and groups responded to the
terror attacks, the role of the flag as a symbol of unity, and what
steps can be taken to broaden interactions among sometimes insular
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Volunteers tend to be active within their own community. This we
need to change," said participant Magdy Eletreby, chairman of the
Islamic New Horizons School in Irvine. "We learned the hard way that
it is not right to limit your involvement to your immediate
community. We need to branch out as much as possible. The people who
stood by us are the people who knew us."</TE>
<TE>   Four of the participants were from a sociology class at Orange
Coast College, where students were given a choice of joining a
dialogue group or writing a 10-page paper. Expecting an easy grade,
some of the students said they were surprised by the intensity of the
discussions, and revelations about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   One, Bonnie Pak, said she considered herself to be open-minded,
but the sessions forced her to confront a blind spot: homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I realize I was pretty close-minded about certain things,"
she said. "I never realized how isolated I was. I was raised
Christian and I always thought gays and lesbians were wrong....I'm
trying to get a sense of awareness. I want to have an open mind."</TE>
<TE>   The beginning of such personal evolutions, organizers believe,
lies in conversation. But first, they have to draw people together.</TE>
<TE>   Using a two-year, $100,000 grant, Orange County's branch of the
National Conference for Community and Justice hopes to create a
Community Cousins Program, drawing families from different faiths and
backgrounds to link up with Arabic and Muslim families.</TE>
<TE>   The first session, to involve 30 to 40 families from several
churches and temples, will be in a park; later sessions will move to
family homes in hopes of establishing long-lived friendships, said
William Shane, the group's Orange County executive director.</TE>
<TE>   "People will have dinner together, then maybe go to movies
together. You'll go to my kid's Little League game and we'll go to
your kid's play," Shane said. "Eventually, we'll have Thanksgiving
dinner together."</TE>
<TE>   Although the program is in the planning stages, Shane said,
enthusiasm has been high, driven by curiosity and the belief that one
way to avoid conflict is to understand and appreciate other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "With the events of 9/11, people suddenly were confronted with the
fact that they don't know anything about major peoples of the world,"
Shane said. "They aren't on CNN. They are down the street and we want
to get to know our neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts have extended beyond issues of tolerance. New York-based
Action Without Borders, which operates the www.idealist. org Web
site, used the weeks after the attacks to launch a long-planned
international day of meetings, urging those in the nonprofit sector
to devise fresh strategies for tackling local problems.</TE>
<TE>   The goal: establish "help centers" worldwide through which
community groups can meet, share resources and strategies, and give
would-be volunteers a place to find projects to join.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 meetings convened around the world on a day in
February and one in March. They were arranged over the Internet, but
held in coffee shops, community rooms and homes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty amazing," said Ami Dar, founder and executive
director of Action Without Borders. "We had about 2,000 people in
February, in about 120 different communities in 40 countries on the
same day."</TE>
<TE>   Although the idea for the meetings arose several years ago, the
terror attacks helped in their launch.</TE>
<TE>   "People who on Sept. 10 would have had no time for you are now
listening, so from that point of view, it made it easier," Dar said.
"But it was not a direct response. We never actually mentioned 9/11
[in organizing material]."</TE>
<TE>   Three groups in the Los Angeles area met, bringing together peace
activists in Huntington Beach, medical-support experts in West Los
Angeles and young professionals at a homeless shelter near downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We had about 15 people from a range of different professions,"
said Teresa Norland, one of the founders of the 16-month-old Young
Professional Group, a fund-raising arm of the Good Shepherd Center
for Women. "It was amazing to see how the Internet can mobilize
people."</TE>
<TE>   Co-founder R. Jennifer Gibbons said the terror attacks unleashed
not only rage and grief, but benevolence, as well.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to get involved; they want to change the world and
feel better about themselves," said Gibbons, who works in television
production.</TE>
<TE>   Hosting an idealist.org session was one step in the group's
efforts to harness those impulses. The 40-member Young Professionals
Group also has scheduled a fund-raiser and social mixer May 18 at the
Inshala Art Gallery, hoping to use a buffet dinner, open bar and live
music to draw fresh blood.</TE>
<TE>   "We did try to make the best out of the situation," said Norland,
a fund-raiser for the Los Angeles County-USC Violence Intervention
Program in East Los Angeles. "We hope to raise money and exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Lash, a longtime peace activist and organizer from
Huntington Beach, hosted two meetings, drawing about 15 people to the
first and half that to the second. After what he said was a slow
start as participants got to know each other, the group began making
plans for a "help center," and Lash is scouting out a site for such a
center on Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm totally optimistic," said Lash, community education
coordinator for the Orange County Red Cross. "The way the times are,
people are thirsty for something like that....It's just a different
feeling between then [Sept. 11] and now. It's a watershed event in a
whole list of things that are happening right now."</TE>
<TE>   And in some quarters, the results are becoming measurable.</TE>
<TE>   Wyle volunteered to host the Irvine living room dialogue as a
member of the social action committee at University Synagogue. During
the final session last week, he listened intently as Eletreby from
the Islamic school mapped out his desire to link groups in community
actions.</TE>
<TE>   The point, he said, is not to lecture each other about
understanding differences, but to move beyond differences to work for
communal good.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, the Muslim and the Jew agreed to try to bring
together members of their respective faiths in sessions for Second
Harvest, the Orange County program that sends volunteers into
already-harvested fields to gather produce left behind. The food is
then donated to soup kitchens and other facilities that feed the
hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be great," Eletreby said, nodding his head as he
agreed to work with Wyle. "That would benefit the community at
large."</TE>
<TE>   Wyle clasped his hands and settled back in his chair, his faced
creased with the satisfied smile of a man whose lottery ticket had
just paid off.</TE>

<HD>CSUN to Honor Life of Folk Arts</HD>
<DH>Celebration: Advocate and musician Bess Lomax Hawes will be
honored at the campus today for her distinguished career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa Richardson struggled for a moment to find the right words to
describe the effect Bess Lomax Hawes has had on folk arts in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Bess is probably the mother of any of us who do work in public
folk arts," said Richardson, who manages the year-old folk and
traditional arts program for the Los Angeles County Arts Commission.
"She's like a Renaissance woman. She's an educator, she's a producer,
she's been an advocate for the arts her whole life. She's really one
of the most important people in the field."</LD>
<LD>   Today, the distinguished folklorist and scholar will be honored
with a distinguished achievement award from Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<TE>   Now 81 and living in Northridge, Hawes has been a force in
American folk arts since she was a girl.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, she worked with her father, John L. Lomax, and her
brother, Alan, on their groundbreaking collection of American folk
music, "Our Singing Country." In the 1940s, she performed with Woody
Guthrie, Pete Seeger and her late husband, Butch Hawes, as one of the
Almanac Singers.</TE>
<TE>   She co-wrote "Charlie on the MTA," a hit for the Kingston Trio
during the folk revival of the '50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   The founding director of the folk and traditional arts program of
the National Endowment for the Arts, Hawes in 1982 created the
National Heritage Fellowships, which honor a dozen master folk
artists each year, be they hula masters or Laotian weavers. She also
helped establish apprenticeship programs designed to ensure that
traditional arts survive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine a folk arts program at the federal level
without her," said Barry Bergey, director of Folk and Traditional
Arts for the NEA. "She's really the one who conceptualized it and
made it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Hawes had seen the positive role government could play in
promoting the arts during the Roosevelt era--and had also seen how
quickly that support could disappear, Bergey said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a good strategist," Bergey said, in explaining how Hawes
helped create durable federal, state, regional and local folk arts
programs. "She had the Rolodex, but she also had the commitment to
the artists and the art forms."</TE>
<TE>   Lomax received the National Medal of the Arts from President
Clinton in 1993, along with director Billy Wilder, singer Ray Charles
and writers William Styron and Arthur Miller.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the NEA created the Bess Lomax Hawes Award, which honors
people who make major contributions to folk and traditional arts.</TE>
<TE>   "She was my first guitar teacher," recalled Roz Larman of West
Hills, co-host of "FolkScene" on public radio for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Lomax once joked that his sister taught the entire state of
California to play the guitar--because she developed methods for
teaching dozens of people at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Hawes' daughter, Naomi Bishop, director of liberal studies and an
anthropology professor at CSUN, said, "Even now, years later, you
can't go anywhere without people coming up and saying, 'I took guitar
lessons from your mother.'"</TE>
<TE>   Bishop recalled that having a beloved mother--and one ahead of her
time--was sometimes trying. Hawes played the banjo, an instrument
that made young Bishop cringe; other mothers played the guitar.</TE>
<TE>   And Hawes once entertained Bishop's Girl Scout troop with a
rendition of "The Devil-Curst Wife." The traditional song, which
extols the superiority of women, includes mild profanity that upset
one of Bishop's fellow scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I was embarrassed," Bishop said, although Hawes "was simply
trying to raise our consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   The tribute to Hawes will take place at the CSUN Center for the
Visual and Performing Arts at 7 p.m., before a performance by the
Aman folk dance ensemble. Hawes taught folklore at the university.</TE>
<TE>   The program will include traditional dance from five continents
and pieces inspired by Lomax, including a performance by children
from the Balboa Gifted/High Ability Magnet School, said Rose Anne
Schoof, executive director of Aman.</TE>
<TE>   Schoof said the troupe is using a grant from the California Arts
Council to introduce elementary school children to folk music and
dance from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hawes, who plans to speak briefly at the tribute, once defined
folk art as "an identifier ... a public statement of what a hell of a
fine thing it is to be a Lithuanian or a Greek or a Comanche Indian
... so that you feel good and people looking at the work will say,
'That's good' or 'That's beautiful' or 'That's different.'"</TE>

<HD>A High Hedge Brings Brush With the Law</HD>
<DH>Regulation: City arrests homeowner, saying she let curbside
shrub grow too tall, creating hazard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Kay Leibrand has the kind of California courtyard you might see in a
magazine: towering redwood trees, a blooming dogwood, fragrant herbs
and, beyond those, a dense green hedge between the sidewalk and
street that shields her property from traffic noise and unsightly
cars.</LD>
<LD>   Now that hedge could land her in jail. Leibrand, a 61-year-old
software engineer, faces a criminal misdemeanor charge for letting
the hedge, a xylosma shrub, grow too high. She was arrested late last
month at the home she shares with her husband, Roger, and is
scheduled for arraignment May 30. She was not taken into custody.</LD>
<LD>   She is accused of violating a city public nuisance law that
prohibits shrubbery more than 2 feet tall on the strip of land
between the sidewalk and the street. Her hedge, on a corner lot in
the Midtown neighborhood, is about 6 feet tall.</LD>
<TE>   She is the first to face criminal charges under the law, but her
arrest comes as the city has vowed to promote visibility and safety
requirements to protect pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists.
Leibrand could face up to six months in jail and a maximum fine of
$1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I sit here to read and look at my garden, and I'd rather not see
the cars whizzing by," said Leibrand, who is fighting breast cancer
and undergoes weekly chemotherapy treatments. She and her husband
planted the shrub about 30 years ago, and she said it has been this
tall for a quarter of a century. There have not been any accidents at
her corner, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The city says she had plenty of notice before the police showed up
at her door to place her under arrest. She acknowledges receiving
some warning letters from the city last year, but said she believed
she was negotiating for a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Leibrand said she feels she was singled out because city leaders
face political pressures to make the streets safer. She believes the
view for drivers and pedestrians is unobstructed by the foliage,
which she said is on land owned by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was complying, or at least negotiating, up until the
very end. I was actually waiting for answers from the special legal
counsel office to see what my options were before I took any action."</TE>
<TE>   The Leibrands' street leads to an elementary school, and the road
becomes busy before and after school as parents rush to drop off or
pick up children.</TE>
<TE>   Leibrand maintains a Web site chronicling her recent
correspondence with the city and said she has received numerous
e-mails of support from others in Palo Alto, as well as a couple of
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   She believes that the city started focusing attention on her
property after a neighbor complained, but she said the neighbor did
not discuss the issue with her until after the police were involved.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Bayer, special counsel to the city attorney's
office, declined to discuss the specifics of the case while it is
pending. The ordinance, he said, has been part of Palo Alto's municipal
code for years.</TE>
<TE>   "New provisions were added regarding sight visibility because of
community concerns regarding safety," Bayer said. "The city
attorney's office has established within the city the visibility
project as a way of communicating the importance of visibility safety
in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Leibrand said that she too is concerned about safety and has
always kept the hedge trimmed low near the corner so motorists and
pedestrians could see over it.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of thing just detracts from the real safety problems,"
she said, noting while she speaks that yet another motorist has run
the stop sign at her corner.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it would have been easier to just cut the hedge when
she was asked. And Leibrand admitted that will be the likely outcome,
criminal charges or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure I'm going to have to pay a fine, and I'll probably have
to cut it down," she said. "But since it's been criminalized anyways,
I'm afraid to do anything until I've met with a lawyer," something
she did Thursday after reporting to police headquarters to be
fingerprinted and have her mug shot taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought this was going to end sooner, because it's so
silly," Leibrand said, "but things haven't been making sense."</TE>

<HD>Local Housing Market Still on Blistering Pace</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Analyst sees no end in sight to 'buying
frenzy.' Brokers expect a leveling off. Prices for a typical home up
$35,000 for quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's frenzied housing market continued its climb in
March, as sales and prices soared to record highs and analysts split
on how long the boom can continue.</LD>
<LD>   For the first quarter of 2002, sales were up nearly 23% compared
with the year before, which was also a very good year. And prices
were up $35,000 on a typical house for the quarter, according to
DataQuick Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of sticker shock out there, but there's also a
buying frenzy," DataQuick analyst John Karevoll said. "And this could
go on for quite a while, through the summer, if not the fall."</LD>
<TE>   Local real estate agents, however, say they think the market is
headed for a plateau, not a decline.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a feeling out here by most of the Realtors that we need
an evening out and that there will be one," said Peter Greer,
president-elect of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "But the bubble isn't going to burst. There's just too much demand
for housing."</TE>
<TE>   Sales have risen sharply this year despite an increasing shortage
of available houses.</TE>
<TE>   The price of a typical home reached an all-time high of $312,000
last month, up $28,000 since January and up $34,000 from March 2001.
That median price reflects the point at which half the homes cost
more and half less.</TE>
<TE>   Home sales and prices are surging upward, Karevoll said, because
of short supply, low interest rates and buyers' fears that they'll be
left behind if they don't purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Despite high prices, homes are still relatively affordable when
considering only a buyer's monthly mortgage payments.</TE>
<TE>   "In raw dollars, the mortgage costs are still roughly what they
were during the boom 13 years ago because of low interest rates,"
Karevoll said. "And that's not counting 13 years of inflation. So
there's still a lot of elbow room for increases."</TE>
<TE>   Last month alone, Ventura County owners sold 1,614 houses and
condominiums, up from 1,457 in March 2001 and nearly three times more
than in the same month a decade ago, when the county was entering an
eight-year slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, sales and prices accelerate in March after a winter
slowdown, but this winter also set records. And the momentum only
seems to be increasing, according to real estate experts.</TE>
<TE>   While DataQuick counts sales when they close escrow, a west county
Realtors' group that counts deals when they are first struck,
reported that March sales were up 41% over February and a $500,000
median price for homes still on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Barroca, communications manager for the Ventura County Coastal
Assn. of Realtors, pointed to two telltale signs of an accelerating
market--homes selling in fewer days and an increase in sales despite
a shortage of available houses.</TE>
<TE>   Since April 1, the number of homes for sale by Realtors in Oxnard,
Ventura, Camarillo, Santa Paula, Port Hueneme and Fillmore has
dropped from 536 to 465, and the average number of days a house was
on the market dropped from 56 to 45, Barroca said. The number of
condos on the market dropped from 75 to 63.</TE>
<TE>   "They're selling faster and we have even less inventory, so that's
why the prices are higher," Barroca said. "The Realtors are telling
us all the time there's just nothing out there for sale."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura broker Karen Campbell, president of the west county
association, said she's surprised by the strength of the market and
questioned how long the rise will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had several conversations in the last week, and everybody is
just amazed at the prices, and wondering how much longer it is going
to go up," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how the economy in our area is going to support
these prices."</TE>
<TE>   Houses are selling so fast, often with multiple bids above the
asking price, that some agents are not listing new properties with
the association's multiple listing service, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're seeing these office exclusives," Campbell said. "There
are 35 or 40 more homes on the market that you wouldn't even know
about if you didn't know the listing agent."</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented run-up worries Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty soon we're going to be out of housing that people can
afford, so where are the workers of our communities going to live?"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Greer, a Thousand Oaks agent and association leader, said he
thinks the market will balance itself out in coming months. For now,
the average Conejo Valley house is on the market only 45 days,
compared with 84 a year ago. And listings are down to about 550, far
below the usual level.</TE>
<TE>   "Real estate is cyclical," Greer said. "We are actually just now
seeing the impact of many, many years when the market was down."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the scorching home sales market hits hard at the backbone of
the community, Greer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding we don't have homes to meet the needs of the
entry-level and workforce people," he said. "In other words, our
firefighters, our policemen, our teachers. They start at under
$40,000 a year, and they have to live somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of county households can afford to buy a home
today, compared with about one-fifth a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Karevoll said that his analysis of homebuyer profiles shows
that a typical buyer is not yet stretching beyond the benchmark 33%
of income to make mortgage payments.</TE>
<TE>   "As counterintuitive as it may sound, there really are no
immediate signs of distress in the market," Karevoll said. "Default
rates are still very low and there is no shift by buyers to risky
types of loans.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a slowdown," he said. "But it won't happen for a
while."</TE>

<HD>Legal Strategy Being Formed in Blake Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Experts say the defense is likely to focus on Bonny
Lee Bakley's past to suggest that someone other than the actor killed
her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although actor Robert Blake has yet to be formally charged in court
with murdering his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, the battle lines in the
case are clearly in view.</LD>
<LD>   For Blake's defense lawyer, Harland W. Braun, the task is clear:
Persuade potential jurors that Bakley was such a sleazy individual
that hundreds of people had a motive to kill her, and consequently
take the focus off his client.</LD>
<LD>   For prosecutors Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A. Dohi, the goal is
equally clear: Keep potential jurors focused on the evidence that
ties Blake to the crime and convince them that Braun is offering
nothing more than implausible scenarios about phantom killers.</LD>
<TE>   Although the California Supreme Court has issued several major
decisions on "somebody else did it" evidence, there is still room for
debate. Lying ahead in this case may be a ferocious legal battle over
just how much Braun can "dirty up" Bakley in court in an effort to
suggest someone other than Blake killed her.</TE>
<TE>   Within days after Bakley, 44, was shot in the head outside a
Studio City restaurant in May, Braun had already begun focusing on
her salacious past--including the operation of a mail-order lonely
hearts business in which she conned men out of money by promising sex
and nude photos.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Blake, 68, was arrested Thursday night, Braun pushed
the envelope even further. "Everyone who ever came in contact with
her had a motive" to kill Bakley, Braun said, casting an
extraordinarily wide net of suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Braun's aggressive strategy makes sense given the circumstances,
said veteran defense lawyer Barry Tarlow. Bakley's past "is clearly a
nightmare for a prosecutor," he said, because it means that there are
potentially dozens of other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   But the strategy also involves risks. Nearly a year ago, Braun
gave police a trunkload of material on Bakley and said the material
might lead them to the killer.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, Capt. Jim Tatreau of the Los Angeles Police
Department's robbery-homicide division said detectives had
meticulously checked those leads and many others--interviewing 150
witnesses in 20 states, gathering 900 items of evidence. That probe
eventually led the investigators back to their initial suspect and
the conclusion that Blake murdered his wife. Tatreau said Blake shot
Bakley after they ate dinner at Vitello's restaurant. Even though
there is no eyewitness, the authorities have a compelling
circumstantial case, Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Throwing down the gauntlet to the police "was a risk and a
double-edged sword," said Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson. "Now
it makes it harder for Harland to say that the police did not do a
thorough investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD "took their time and attempted to eliminate every red
herring a good defense attorney would raise as reasonable doubt,"
concurred Los Angeles defense lawyer Andrew M. Stein.</TE>
<TE>   Even Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., O.J. Simpson's lead defense lawyer,
said on ABC's "Good Morning America" that the LAPD "can't be accused
of rushing to judgment" in the Bakley murder--precisely what he had
accused the authorities of doing in the Simpson case.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, before a bailiff has called the court to order even once,
the Blake case is being played out for hours nightly on television
against the backdrop of the 1995 O.J. Simpson trial, in which the
former football star was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman despite DNA evidence
pointing to Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Significant Differences Between the Cases</TE>
<TE>   There clearly are significant differences between the Blake case
and the Simpson trial, a saga that took on epic proportions and
generated more media coverage than any prior trial. Simpson was a
true celebrity, a former Heisman Trophy winner at USC, then a
National Football League star, television commentator and Hertz
pitchman who drove a Bentley, had a glamorous blond wife and
frequented swank restaurants from coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, on the other hand, was an aging actor fading into
obscurity, best known for playing a detective in the mid-'70s
television series "Baretta." He was living quietly in the San
Fernando Valley with a woman he married only after DNA tests revealed
that he had impregnated her. They occupied separate houses on
adjoining land that Blake owned.</TE>
<TE>   One major difference between the two situations is that there is
no race angle in the Blake case: a white man is accused of murdering
a white woman.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, police say they have two witnesses who will testify
that Blake solicited them to kill his wife. And they have charged
Blake's bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, with being part of a conspiracy to
murder Bakley. In the Simpson case, there were no other defendants.</TE>
<TE>   There is one particularly unique element to the Blake case: Both
the police and Blake's lawyer say he had a motive to kill his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the motive is Robert Blake had contempt for Bonny
Bakley," the LAPD's Tatreau said. "He felt he was trapped in a
marriage that he wanted no part of and, quite frankly, the situation
was not to his liking at all."</TE>
<TE>   After Blake was arrested Thursday night, Braun conceded that his
client had a motive to kill Bakley, and he repeated that Friday in an
interview with The Times and on "Larry King Live."</TE>
<TE>   "I have never said that there is not a motive," Braun said. "She
turned his life upside down. She got him involved in a marriage he
did not want to be in."</TE>
<TE>   But Braun also emphasized that "there are a lot of people who had
a motive to kill Bonny Bakley.... This is a whodunit based on
circumstantial evidence. It's about Robert's relationship with Bonny
and Bonny's relationship with the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Defender Questions Tactic on Motive</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Howard Weitzman, who successfully defended auto
mogul John DeLorean in a 1984 drug trial, said he was stunned by
Braun's statements.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe I have ever heard a defense lawyer" concede
motive at this stage of a case, he said. "The jury will not have to
look for a reason" Bakley was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   While this may have been a surprising move, it was the right one,
said defense lawyer Mark Geragos. "You don't fight the facts on that.
No one who knows the story will believe there was no motive," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And this may not be as much of a problem for Blake as it appears
on the surface, said Tarlow, the former president of California
Attorneys for Criminal Justice.</TE>
<TE>   "My dear friend, Bobby Lee Cook, the great lawyer from
Summerville, Georgia, once told me 'the best defense in the world is
the SOB deserved to die,'" Tarlow recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, Ms. Bakley did not deserve to be killed by anyone,"
Tarlow quickly added. "Nevertheless, her colorful and outrageous
lifestyle will become the center of the defense of the case."</TE>
<TE>   That past included frequenting bars in search of a celebrity
husband, and a trail of men in several states who contend they were
tricked out of large sums of money by Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Among those left in the lurch was DeMart C. Besly, author of a
400-page manuscript titled "Ubiquitous Bonny: Mistress of Sham!"
Besly, a Montana widower, said that within moments after he and
Bakley tied the knot in Elko, Nev., in 1988, he handed her a roll of
quarters and then she vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "I shall always consider Bonny's desertion a blessing," Besly
wrote. "Her modus operandi was to snare elderly men by dangling sex
as bait, hopefully to acquire their property, then conveniently slide
them into an early grave."</TE>
<TE>   Braun has also suggested that Bakley may have been slain by a "hit
man" she hired to kill Blake but who turned on her. He also said she
could have been murdered by a robber who was operating in the San
Fernando Valley at the time of her killing.</TE>
<TE>   'Third Party' Evidence Could Be Debated</TE>
<TE>   If the case goes to trial, there could be a heated courtroom
skirmish over just how much of Bakley's troubled past Braun can bring
before the jury members in an attempt to persuade them that someone
else--known in the law as a "third party"--was the killer.</TE>
<TE>   The California Supreme Court has ruled in a series of cases that
any relevant evidence that raises a reasonable doubt of a defendant's
guilt--including evidence tending to show that someone other than the
defendant committed the crime--is admissible.</TE>
<TE>   However, such evidence may be excluded at the judge's discretion
if there is a substantial danger of undue consumption of time or of
prejudicing, confusing or misleading the jury.</TE>
<TE>   To be admissible, such evidence does not have to show substantial
proof of a probability that a third person committed the crime; it
only has to be capable of raising a reasonable doubt of the
defendant's guilt, the state's high court ruled in People vs. Hall in
1986.</TE>
<TE>   However, the court cautioned that "we do not require that any
evidence, however remote, must be admitted to show a third party's
possible culpability.... Evidence of mere motive or opportunity [of
another person] to commit the crime ... without more, will not
suffice to raise a reasonable doubt of a defendant's guilt; there
must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to
the actual perpetration of the crime."</TE>
<TE>   That is a tough hurdle to clear and Braun may not make it, said
defense lawyer Stein.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have evidence that connects the third party to this
case.... I don't believe any trial judge is going to allow Harland to
do character assassination on Bonny Bakley," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Geragos said all the material Braun turned over to the police
months ago gives him "ample opportunity to meet the threshold for
third-party evidence."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the prosecutors have said nothing about this issue in
public.</TE>
<TE>   However, Cary W. Goldstein, a Beverly Hills attorney who
represents some Bakley family members who plan to sue Blake in civil
court for wrongful death, has decried Braun's tactics as an attempt
to smear a woman who was murdered. Braun's theories, Goldstein said,
are "baseless diversions designed to create reasonable doubt."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles defense lawyer Gigi Gordon said that however the judge
rules on the third-party evidence issue, Braun, armed with Bakley's
life history, already has done "a real good job" of framing the
debate for potential jurors.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this is out there," Gordon said. "Even I, who am
desperately trying to avoid hearing about this case, keep hearing
about it whenever I turn on the television. And the impression is
that this is a woman who was a parasite and created nothing but
misery in her wake.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this means it was OK to kill her," Gordon emphasized,
"but in the back of their minds people may think, 'I wouldn't want
her in my life.'"</TE>

<LD>A Newport Beach recreation coordinator was arrested on suspicion of
molesting children after a co-worker told authorities the man had
been seen sucking on a boy's toes, police said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Trenton Michael Veches, 31, of Huntington Beach was being held in
Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail. He faces up to eight years in
prison if convicted.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Veches on Wednesday, a day after the co-worker
told city officials about allegations of inappropriate behavior
involving Veches and a boy, said Newport Beach Police Sgt. Steve
Shulman.</LD>
<TE>   Shulman said detectives found digital pictures in Veches' home
computer depicting partially clad children and Veches sucking
children's toes. Shulman said the children appeared to be ages 6 to
10.</TE>
<TE>   As a recreational coordinator for Newport Beach's Community
Services Department, Veches supervised employees who ran after-school
programs. He was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome
of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said in a written statement Friday that they had
performed a background check on Veches before hiring him in August
1998 and found no arrests or inappropriate conduct.</TE>
<TE>   ''The city will do everything possible to help parents and
children who may have been [affected],'' said City Manager Homer
Bludau.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 5, Dies After Being Bitten by Family Rottweiler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY</DL>
<LD>A Monterey girl has died after being mauled by her family dog in one
of two separate attacks along the Central Coast in recent days.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old was walking with her grandmother and brother in a
field when a lizard startled them Friday afternoon. In the commotion,
at least one of the family's two large Rottweilers pounced, biting
the girl's head and body, police spokesman Randy Taylor said.</LD>
<LD>   She was immediately taken to the hospital, but died Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   The grandmother was shaken and couldn't tell authorities whether
one or both dogs attacked.</TE>
<TE>   "It was spontaneous," said Mike Ventimiglia, a chief at the
Monterey Fire Department. "It wasn't like there were mad dogs running
about. It was just a freak moment."</TE>
<TE>   That mauling came less than 24 hours after a 5-year-old Salinas
girl was attacked by her family's Doberman pinscher.</TE>
<TE>   That girl was mauled so severely Thursday that part of her scalp
was pulled from her skull, which the dog also fractured. She was
admitted to the intensive care unit at Salinas Valley Memorial
Hospital in critical condition, but by Saturday was recovering,
according to a hospital nursing supervisor.</TE>

<LD>Three adults were hospitalized and four other people--including two
children--were treated for minor injuries after a two-vehicle crash
Saturday in Buena Park.</LD>
<LD>   The collision occurred about 8 a.m. as a Chevrolet traveled south
on Knott Avenue and a Honda exited the eastbound Artesia Freeway,
Buena Park Police Lt. Ken Coovert said. The Honda struck the Blazer,
sending it into the median, where it rolled over twice and landed on
its roof.</LD>
<LD>   Three adults, who apparently weren't wearing seat belts, were
ejected from the Blazer. One was pinned underneath, Coovert said. Two
of the adults were reported in fair condition at UCI Medical Center
in Orange, and the third was in serious condition. Two children
riding in the vehicle suffered minor injuries and were treated at
UCI.</LD>
<TE>   The driver and passenger in the Honda were treated at the scene,
Coovert said.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Airport Will See a Changing of the Guard</HD>
<DH>Safety: City police will soon take over security duties
from the soldiers, who have been there since Oct. 19.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Except for a change of uniform, passengers won't likely notice when
the California National Guard wraps up its tour of duty at Oxnard
Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Airport officials last week reached a verbal agreement with the
Oxnard Police Department for officers to assume security duties for
the departing soldiers beginning in early May.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Police Chief Tom Cady said once the written agreement
has been drafted and reviewed, his department will be ready to roll.</LD>
<TE>   "There won't be a lapse in security," Cady said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the airport's schedule of five daily United Express
flights, Cady predicted the department would use flexible scheduling
and overtime to accommodate the facility's security needs.</TE>
<TE>   "This won't affect our protection of the community," Cady said.</TE>
<TE>   The switch to local law enforcement is happening at regional
airports across the country under the orders of the recently formed
Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Smith, director of airports for Ventura County, said he
received a directive from the security administration stating the
National Guard was pulling out of airports nationwide on April 30.</TE>
<TE>   Although the withdrawal was expected to occur eventually, the
April date came as news to officers of Delta Battery, 144th Field
Artillery, 40th Infantry Division, whose troops have served at the
airport since Oct. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Nate Reddicks of the National Guard said soldiers are
prepared to remain on duty until May 10, if needed.</TE>
<TE>   The security administration has allocated money to cover the cost
of using local law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   How much has been set aside is unknown, but any amount the federal
government does not cover will be picked up by Oxnard Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The assignment of the Oxnard police will only be temporary until
the security administration moves federal officers into place in
mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cady's officers are studying federal security manuals
and will undergo special training prior to their assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Many travelers say the change in security won't be any less
reassuring than the sight of camouflaged National Guard personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "They will still be dressed in a uniform with a big gun, so it
won't make a difference to me. I will still feel protected," said
Joan Bready of Washington D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Pine of San Diego echoed Bready's sentiments, saying: "The
National Guard has such a high-profile presence but I'm sure the
Oxnard PD will do a fine job."</TE>

<HD>Memories of Old Pan Pacific Resurrected in New Center</HD>
<DH>Architecture: City park building incorporates design
elements from the landmark theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 10 years after fire destroyed the Pan Pacific Auditorium, a
new building on the Park La Brea site will pay homage to the landmark
theater's distinctive architecture.</LD>
<LD>   The new Pan Pacific Park Recreation Center's 45-foot-high spire
recalls the auditorium's fin-shaped towers, a noted example of
Streamline Moderne design.</LD>
<LD>   The 1930s style, defined by curving shapes that hint at motion and
the machine age, is also integrated into the new center's gymnasiums,
stage and classroom space.</LD>
<TE>   When it opens Monday on the north side of the park, the center
will house city Department of Recreation and Parks programs from the
West Wilshire Recreation Center, located in the southern half of the
park. That center, planners hope, will eventually be replaced with a
larger facility to provide more programs for senior citizens in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   The centers are among a series of projects revitalizing the area
surrounding Farmers Market in the Fairfax district. The park is
across from the Grove, a new $160-million retail complex.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Market was spruced up as part of that effort, and new
housing in the area is planned. There also are plans to expand the
Los Angeles Public Library's Fairfax branch, next to West Wilshire
Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Money from county Proposition K and city Proposition A paid
for the new $5.8-million center. The parks department also used funds
that residential developers pay to provide recreation space near
their projects.</TE>
<TE>   Honoring the auditorium was important, said Gat Lum, the parks
department's regional superintendent. "The Pan Pacific has been a
long-recognized landmark of Los Angeles," she said. "When we had the
opportunity to build a building there, especially a public building,
there was a lot of call from the community to really put back some of
the pertinent features that were part of the Pan Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   Photo tiles in the recreation center's entryway offer a pictorial
representation of great works of architecture, including the Pan
Pacific, said Jeffrey Kalban, whose firm, Jeffrey Kalban &amp;
Associates, designed the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the kids to see the architecture," he said. "How else do
we express to future generations what the Pan Pacific was?"</TE>
<TE>   The auditorium stood out against the backdrop of fields and oil
wells that surrounded it when it was built in 1935. Later, the area
became known as Gilmore Island, an entertainment destination with a
go-cart racetrack and a baseball field where the Hollywood Stars once
played.</TE>
<TE>   The auditorium's facade, illuminated against the night sky, drew
California's newly established car culture from miles around. "These
towers were a signal to people that something was here," Kalban said.</TE>
<TE>   During its 37 years, the Pan Pacific hosted car shows
and concerts, ice skating and roller derbies. Presidential candidates
held rallies there. It was even the site of Elvis Presley's first
West Coast appearance in 1957.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pan Pacific closed in 1972 after venues such as the Forum
started to take its share of entertainment events. Debates about
restoring the building as a hotel and entertainment complex or a
museum ensued as it suffered neglect, vandalism and periodic fires.
In 1989, a final fire destroyed the building's facade, essentially
eliminating any chance of saving the landmark.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the new recreation center faces west on Beverly Boulevard
at Gardner Street, just as the old building did. But the new building
was not built on the ashes of the former.</TE>
<TE>   Debris from the demolished Pan Pacific had mixed into the soil,
making it an unsuitable foundation for the new building. Construction
also disturbed soil contaminated by oil, pushing back the new Pan
Pacific's opening date several months.</TE>
<TE>   The parks department spent almost $1 million to remove the soil,
which officials said posed no danger. They hope to recoup some of the
money from state and county authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The parks department wasn't sure if the oil was an undiscovered
"Beverly Hillbillies-style" pocket or if it spilled from an old well,
said Maureen Tamuri, the agency's assistant general manager for
planning and construction.</TE>
<TE>   Once naturally occurring oil is disturbed, it is classified as a
contaminant and must be removed. "We're under obligation only to
remove what we touched and hit," Tamuri said. "And believe me, we
didn't go looking for it."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in the old Pan Pacific, the architects chose to carry the
Streamline style inside the new 17,000-square-foot building, less
than a fifth the size of the original. White stripes cut into the
brick-red and forest-green building on the outside. Inside, the
colors are reversed, with colored strips of uneven concrete blocks
contrasting with smooth, white-block walls. Glass blocks allow light
to illuminate the entryway and adjacent classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   A double-sided stage opens into one of two gymnasiums and a
classroom. Fire walls can be used to block off one side of the stage
for smaller performances or left open to accommodate larger events.
The dressing rooms are professional quality, Kalban said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a basketball court stands ready while a sandpit
awaits the arrival of playground equipment. The remaining area was
landscaped to match the rest of Pan Pacific Park.</TE>

<LD>At least the 12-year-old Irvine girl is alive and could testify. So
is the 15-year-old Yorba Linda boy. In the grand scheme of things,
you'd almost have to call them lucky.</LD>
<LD>   That's much more than we can say for baby Christopher, the
brain-damaged infant who doctors say won't recover. His father,
accused of causing the injuries, waits in Orange County Jail to see
what charges he'll face, which depend on whether the boy lives or
dies.</LD>
<LD>   The Irvine girl is in protective custody after police allege that
she's been kept out of school and used as a housemaid for a wealthy
family. The Yorba Linda boy also is in protective custody while his
parents await charges that they physically and emotionally mistreated
him.</LD>
<TE>   It'd be one thing if I'd plucked these cases out of the archives
of crime. Instead, all were in the local news last week.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, then, the cases provide a measuring stick for how
far we've come in the last 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   It was the turn of the century (the 20th, not the 21st) when
someone in New York City wanted to aid an aggrieved child.
Unfortunately, the child's advocate couldn't find any legal precedent
for doing so. Ever imaginative, apparently, she invoked
cruelty-to-animals laws as her precedent and was allowed in the case.</TE>
<TE>   I got that story from Harold LaFlamme, an Orange County attorney
for children's rights. LaFlamme was miffed that he couldn't remember
the specifics of the New York case, but says it became the legal
launching pad for protecting children in court.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no other statute the person could use," he says. "There
wasn't any statute saying you can't beat a child, you can't sell a
child out for labor. I can't remember that child's plight, but it was
bad. So she used the animal-cruelty statute to justify intervention
and protect the child."</TE>
<TE>   That's appalling, but we could take solace in knowing that was
1900. Very primitive era, yes?</TE>
<TE>   But what about today, when authorities say the father of the
family kept the 12-year-old Egyptian girl from attending school,
fixed up a "room" for her in the garage and used her as a servant.
The family disputes that she was kept in involuntary servitude, but
doesn't deny the girl wasn't attending school.</TE>
<TE>   In the Yorba Linda case, prosecutors say the parents' idea of
disciplining their son crossed into felony territory. They're accused
of punching him, forcing him to sleep outside on several occasions
and of taking nude photos of him.</TE>
<TE>   The parents of the Yorba Linda boy are a sheriff's deputy and a
public school administrator. I'm in the camp that says parents get a
wide berth in disciplining their children, but if the allegations are
true, the couple needs some serious intervention.</TE>
<TE>   As for 71/2-month-old baby Christopher, he's apparently taken all
the punishment he'll ever get. His mother wants to withdraw his life
support, but his father still has legal rights and is balking, no
doubt to forestall the possibility of murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   LaFlamme represents the young Egyptian girl and baby Christopher.
His nine-member law firm handles many of Orange County's
child-advocacy cases, and that makes me wonder how the guy sleeps at
night--given everything he's seen.</TE>
<TE>   Last week notwithstanding, LaFlamme says, "Things are pretty good
and getting better" when it comes to children's legal rights. One
example: more and more judges are assigning lawyers to children in
family-custody disputes, instead of confining legal help to the
battling parents.</TE>
<TE>   If you could make a wish, I ask LaFlamme ...</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things I've pushed for but never gotten," he says, "is
that I'd like the government to make it a rule or law, if you will,
that you have to take a course in parenting before you can graduate
from high school."</TE>
<TE>   What, and replace trigonometry? Outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   What's really outrageous is how horribly inept some adults are
when it comes to caring for children.</TE>
<TE>   How far have we come since 1900, when children were lumped in with
house pets?</TE>
<TE>   At this pace, I'd say we'll be in great shape in another century
or so.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Mini-City Project on the Fast Track</HD>
<DH>Development: Seen as key to improving the city's image,
RiverPark has raced through the approval process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $750-million RiverPark mini-city, the largest mixed-use project
in Ventura County history, appears headed for approval in a
fast-track process scarcely two years after it was first proposed.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by Oxnard officials who see it as a key step to improving
the city's image, the 700-acre home-and-business development is set
for consideration by the Planning Commission on May 2, and the City
Council shortly after that.</LD>
<LD>   "They have the opportunity to create a showcase project for
Ventura County," City Atty. Gary Gillig said. "And at this point
there are no legal obstacles I anticipate or know of to stop it."</LD>
<TE>   At the junction of the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway,
the RiverPark site is among the most prized undeveloped locations in
the county. And Oxnard officials say construction would represent a
victory for a city that regularly underwrites development to lure new
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark--backed by a $12-billion pension investment fund, a
noted Los Angeles builder and the county's top real estate
deal-maker--is extraordinary both for its ambition and its ability to
deflect criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes about 2,800 dwellings centered on village
greens, a vintage Town Square fashioned after the city of Sonoma's, a
movie theater and restaurants, a first-class hotel and convention
center, three schools, sports fields and a food-and-wine exposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard will go from being the old strawberry capital of the world
to the next CityWalk," said Community Development Director Curtis
Cannon, referring to the popular Universal City pedestrian mall.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial space would total 2.5 million square feet in 30
buildings. By comparison, The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks and the
Pacific View mall in Ventura each contain about 1 million square
feet. The controversial Ahmanson Ranch project near Calabasas has
nearly the same number of homes but only about one-sixth RiverPark's
office and retail space.</TE>
<TE>   Developers hope to break ground by late summer and open the first
of five phases for occupancy by early 2004, after construction of a
new freeway interchange and the widening of the adjacent Santa Clara
River Bridge--a $100-million project set to begin next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be able to point to RiverPark as a sophisticated
development up to the level that good companies want and are
accustomed to seeing," said Steve Kinney, chief of the city-backed
Oxnard Community Development Corp. "That quality of land development
doesn't exist now in Oxnard."</TE>
<TE>   Project Wins Praise From Many Sides</TE>
<TE>   Despite its enormous size and a host of potential problems,
RiverPark has received praise not only from Oxnard City Hall but from
water quality, environmental and affordable housing advocates, and
from school officials and the city and county of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   All initially voiced concerns, but are now at least neutral, if
not entirely satisfied, because of changes by developers to answer
their complaints. The entire project is within Oxnard's growth
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The perspective here, from top to bottom, is that there aren't
any major obstacles," said Paul Calderwood, the planner leading
Ventura's analysis of RiverPark. "We're having productive,
problem-solving types of discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's position is significant, because Oxnard and Ventura
traded lawsuits for a decade over construction of rival shopping
malls before signing a peace treaty. Ventura also had blocked for
years an even larger commercial project on part of the RiverPark site
because of traffic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's greatest potential flaw, in fact, are the nearly
79,000 vehicles that would flow from it each day onto local streets
and the Ventura Freeway. That includes about 10,000 during the
evening rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Freeway is already so clogged during peak hours and on
weekends that cars back up for miles waiting to cross the Santa Clara
River Bridge that connects Oxnard and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   But under a 1998 agreement settling Ventura's lawsuit, Oxnard
won't allow RiverPark to be occupied until the bridge's two-lane
bottleneck to northbound cars is expanded to four lanes. That is
tentatively set for mid-2003. By 2006, the bridge is set to be
widened to 12 lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic, obviously, is a big issue," Ventura Councilman Sandy
Smith said. "But we haven't reached anything in the process where
we've started preparing for war."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps RiverPark's most costly and unusual accommodation is a
tentative agreement to build three schools at an estimated cost of
$47 million.</TE>
<TE>   Educators were concerned the project's 1,900 school-age children
would jam already-crowded campuses in nearby neighborhoods. But
RiverPark agreed not only to donate 37 acres for the three
schools--the usual developer contribution--but to build and equip
those schools, with no guarantee of repayment.</TE>
<TE>   The first elementary school would open as part of the first phase
of 500 homes in 2004, the junior high in 2005 and the second
elementary school in 2006, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Benitez, superintendent of the small Rio School District,
said RiverPark is apparently only the second developer in California
to agree to build new schools without financial support. The Rio
district will apply for state construction bond money to partially
reimburse RiverPark, but the chances of getting the funds are maybe
50-50, Benitez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It does sound like a good deal for us," she said. "But it's a
good deal for the developer too, since the new community will have
built-in schools."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Union High School District, which would have at least 300
new students at its Rio Mesa campus, also would receive about $3.7
million in developer fees, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The project's sheer size has caught the attention of
environmentalists. But they note that the RiverPark site is not
protected by Ventura County's strict farmland and open-space laws.
Nor is it an apparent threat to the nearby river, and could even help
boost ground water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge project, but it's not Ahmanson Ranch," said John
Buse, attorney for the Environmental Defense Center in Ventura. "It's
of similar size, but it's not being built on pristine open space.
It's on the old Town Center site and on the old S. P. Milling [gravel
pits]. Now it's largely a wasteland."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Bottoroff, chairman of Friends of the Santa Clara River, has
studied RiverPark extensively and gives it a thumbs up.</TE>
<TE>   The agency that replenishes the Oxnard Plain's ground water
supplies, the United Water Conservation District, worried that
RiverPark might not manage the old gravel pits in a way that
protected ground water.</TE>
<TE>   But the developer agreed to stabilize pit banks and cooperate in
plans that would allow United to save more river water during rainy
periods so it can settle into water basins.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this project could be a benefit to everyone who pumps
water from these aquifers if these pits could be used for recharge,"
said Steve Bachman, ground water resource manager for United.</TE>
<TE>   Units Set Aside for Low-Income Residents</TE>
<TE>   Poverty lawyers also say RiverPark will provide its share of
affordable housing by setting aside 15% of dwellings for low- and
very-low-income households.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, they've gone beyond what the law requires," said
Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance in Oxnard. But
McCarthy said she will argue that the city should require RiverPark
to provide dwellings affordable for farm workers, who often make less
than $20,000 a year, far less than guidelines for low-income
households.</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to satisfy all parties, RiverPark partners say
they've agreed to spend $99 million in upfront costs on schools,
off-site roads, El Rio storm drains, relocation of a county
maintenance yard and construction of a new fire station operated
jointly by the city and county.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, developers made an eight-story hotel and convention
facility a project centerpiece because city officials desired it.</TE>
<TE>   "The city wants a world-class project, a trophy project, and we're
going to give them that," said Oxnard developer David O. White, a
partner. "The city is investing in the premier project in the county,
and they are getting a financial reward for investing in it."</TE>
<TE>   Because of such considerations, RiverPark is asking the city to
kick back $20 million from the $73 million in sales and property
taxes developers say the project will provide the city as it is built
over 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   After completion, developers say the project will provide Oxnard
with $12 million in sales and property tax revenue each year.
Additional millions in taxes would go to Ventura County, schools and
special districts.</TE>
<TE>   If built, RiverPark would end a 17-year struggle by city officials
to gain a top project on some of the city's last prime freeway
frontage.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, the City Council approved the $500-million Town Center
commercial complex of 4.4 million square feet, including office
towers up to 24 stories high, a low-rise business park, a large
shopping mall, a hotel and a cultural center.</TE>
<TE>   But the development languished, as did a subsequent effort that
began as a severe recession hit in 1990. Just two office buildings
were constructed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Paul Keller, then president of one of the Los Angeles
Basin's largest construction companies, raised $8 million to buy the
defaulted Town Center bonds out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, White, who controls more local real estate than any
other Ventura County developer, secured an option to buy 350 acres
next door, the old Southern Pacific Milling Co. gravel mining site.</TE>
<TE>   Keller gained the financial backing of Oak Tree Capital
Management, a Los Angeles company that oversees billions of dollars
in investments, mostly from pension funds. Keller and White became
partners in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Mini-City on Fast Track</HD>
<DH>Development: RiverPark has raced through the approval
process, and few obstacles are foreseen for $750-million mixed-use
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $750-million RiverPark mini-city, the largest mixed-use project
in Ventura County history, appears headed for approval in a
fast-track process scarcely two years after it was first proposed.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by Oxnard officials who see it as a key step to improving
the city's image, the 700-acre home-and-business development is set
for consideration by the Planning Commission on May 2, and the City
Council shortly after that.</LD>
<LD>   "They have the opportunity to create a showcase project for
Ventura County," City Atty. Gary Gillig said. "And at this point
there are no legal obstacles I anticipate or know of to stop it."</LD>
<TE>   At the junction of the Ventura Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway,
the RiverPark site is among the most prized undeveloped locations in
the county. And Oxnard officials say construction would represent a
victory for a city that regularly underwrites development to lure new
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark--backed by a $12-billion pension investment fund, a
noted Los Angeles builder and the county's top real estate
deal-maker--is extraordinary both for its ambition and its ability to
deflect criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes about 2,800 dwellings centered on village
greens, a vintage Town Square fashioned after the city of Sonoma's, a
movie theater and restaurants, a first-class hotel and convention
center, three schools, sports fields and a food-and-wine exposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Oxnard will go from being the old strawberry capital of the world
to the next CityWalk," said Community Development Director Curtis
Cannon, referring to the popular Universal City pedestrian mall.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial space would total 2.5 million square feet in 30
buildings. By comparison, The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks and the
Pacific View mall in Ventura each contain about 1 million square
feet. The controversial Ahmanson Ranch project near Calabasas has
nearly the same number of homes but only about one-sixth RiverPark's
office and retail space.</TE>
<TE>   Developers hope to break ground by late summer and open the first
of five phases for occupancy by early 2004, after construction of a
new freeway interchange and the widening of the adjacent Santa Clara
River Bridge--a $100-million project set to begin next month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to be able to point to RiverPark as a sophisticated
development up to the level that good companies want and are
accustomed to seeing," said Steve Kinney, chief of the city-backed
Oxnard Community Development Corp. "That quality of land development
doesn't exist now in Oxnard."</TE>
<TE>   Project Wins Praise From Many Sides</TE>
<TE>   Despite its enormous size and a host of potential problems,
RiverPark has received praise not only from Oxnard City Hall but from
water quality, environmental and affordable housing advocates, and
from school officials and the city and county of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   All initially voiced concerns, but are now at least neutral, if
not entirely satisfied, because of changes by developers to answer
their complaints. The entire project is within Oxnard's growth
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The perspective here, from top to bottom, is that there aren't
any major obstacles," said Paul Calderwood, the planner leading
Ventura's analysis of RiverPark. "We're having productive,
problem-solving types of discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's position is significant, because Oxnard and Ventura
traded lawsuits for a decade over construction of rival shopping
malls before signing a peace treaty. Ventura also had blocked for
years an even larger commercial project on part of the RiverPark site
because of traffic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's greatest potential flaw, in fact, are the nearly
79,000 vehicles that would flow from it each day onto local streets
and the Ventura Freeway. That includes about 10,000 during the
evening rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura Freeway is already so clogged during peak hours and on
weekends that cars back up for miles waiting to cross the Santa Clara
River Bridge that connects Oxnard and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   But under a 1998 agreement settling Ventura's lawsuit, Oxnard
won't allow RiverPark to be occupied until the bridge's two-lane
bottleneck to northbound cars is expanded to four lanes. That is
tentatively set for mid-2003. By 2006, the bridge is set to be
widened to 12 lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic, obviously, is a big issue," Ventura Councilman Sandy
Smith said. "But we haven't reached anything in the process where
we've started preparing for war."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps RiverPark's most costly and unusual accommodation is a
tentative agreement to build three schools at an estimated cost of
$47 million.</TE>
<TE>   Educators were concerned the project's 1,900 school-age children
would jam already-crowded campuses in nearby neighborhoods. But
RiverPark agreed not only to donate 37 acres for the three
schools--the usual developer contribution--but to build and equip
those schools, with no guarantee of repayment.</TE>
<TE>   The first elementary school would open as part of the first phase
of 500 homes in 2004, the junior high in 2005 and the second
elementary school in 2006, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Benitez, superintendent of the Rio School District, said
RiverPark is apparently only the second developer in California to
agree to build new schools without financial support. The Rio
district will apply for state construction bond money to partially
reimburse RiverPark, but the chances of getting the funds are maybe
50-50, Benitez said.</TE>

new students at its Rio Mesa campus, also would receive about $3.7
million in developer fees, officials said.</TE>

off-site roads, El Rio storm drains, relocation of a county
maintenance yard and construction of a new fire station operated

<HD>Layne Staley, 34; Lead Singer of Grunge Group Alice in
Chains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Layne Staley, the Alice in Chains lead singer who rose to rock
stardom a decade ago with a series of songs about battling personal
demons, is dead at 34.</LD>
<LD>   The King County medical examiner's office confirmed Saturday that
it was Staley's body that police found Friday night at the singer's
apartment in Seattle's University District, which isn't far from the
house where Kurt Cobain, another star of the city's tormented grunge
rock scene, committed suicide in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities went to the apartment after receiving a call
requesting that they check on someone there. Staley appeared to have
been dead for several days. The cause of death is under
investigation, a spokesman for the examiner's office said.</LD>
<TE>   By the time of Saturday's confirmation, the band's Web site was
already filled with expressions of sadness and loss from fans, who
were aware of Staley's lengthy struggle against heroin addiction.</TE>
<TE>   While parents generally dismissed grunge as relentless whining,
young rock fans by the millions identified with the mostly dark,
disturbing themes about such issues as betrayal, hypocrisy, abuse and
self-destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in the social protest of the 1960s, the target of many
grunge songs wasn't government or other institutions, but parents,
who, the songwriters felt, had failed in their responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the grunge musicians spoke, either in their lyrics or in
interviews, about the struggle to overcome problems they traced to
low self-esteem and having been brought up in broken homes.</TE>
<TE>   There were frequent references to suicide and death in the songs.
One of the most popular tracks on Alice in Chains' 1990 debut album,
"Facelift," was "We Die Young." The album sold more than 2 million
copies.</TE>
<TE>   Though the grunge movement lost its commercial momentum in the
mid-'90s, many of today's best-selling rock bands, including Creed
and Staind, draw upon the style of groups such as Alice in Chains.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Washington state, Staley formed Alice in Chains in
1987 with guitarist Jerry Cantrell, who was already working with
bassist Mike Starr and drummer Sean Kinney, and the band quickly
built a name for itself in the Northwest rock scene.</TE>
<TE>   The group was signed by Columbia Records, and its debut album was
quickly embraced by many of the hard-rock stars of the day, including
Guns 'N Roses' Axl Rose. The quartet had enough of a buzz by the time
its second album, "Dirt," was released in 1992 that the collection
entered the pop charts at No. 6. It sold 4 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, were divided. Some felt that the music was every
bit as calculated and one-dimensional as many parents believed it
was. Yet the band won some support. "At its best, Alice in Chains
hits the vein of the rock tradition that fearlessly confronts the
most threatening end of the emotional spectrum," Spin magazine
declared in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the sales nor endorsements, however, seemed to soothe
Staley's inner torment. "The easier things get, the harder they get,"
he said in a 1991 interview with The Times. "A couple of days ago, I
woke up and felt like I wanted to kill everyone around me--for no
particular reason. I felt like that for two days, uncontrollable
emotions: hate, pain...."</TE>
<TE>   Alice in Chains' next work, a 1994 mini-album titled "Jar of
Flies," entered the charts at No. 1, but doubts were already being
raised about the band's future. Even before Cobain's suicide, the
grunge world had been rocked by tragedy. Andrew Wood, lead singer of
the promising band Mother Love Bone, died of a heroin overdose in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   When Alice in Chains didn't tour in support of "Jar," breakup
rumors were rampant. The fans' fears were compounded when the band's
scheduled performance at Woodstock II in 1994 was canceled amid talk
of "health problems" in the group. The foursome did return in 1995
with a self-titled album that also entered the charts at No. 1. The
musicians also gave their first live performance in years in early
1996 on MTV, but they remained largely out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   When Staley did surface for interviews during that period, he made
no secret of his addiction. Like Cobain had done in interviews,
however, Staley spoke about the consequences of the drug and warned
his fans to avoid it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote about drugs, and I didn't think I was being unsafe or
careless by writing about them," he told Rolling Stone in 1996.
"Here's how my thinking pattern went: When I tried drugs, they were
... great, and they worked for me for years, and now they're turning
against me--and now I'm walking through hell."</TE>
<TE>   With Cobain dead, Soundgarden broken up and Alice in Chains
inactive, the grunge scene lost its grip on the young rock
imagination in the late-'90s as a new generation of bands took over
the stages.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the low profile and all the drug talk over the years,
some casual rock fans may be surprised to learn of Staley's death.
Many probably assumed he had died years ago. The news Saturday,
however, was a reminder of all the lost promise in grunge rock--not
only Staley's death but the whole tragic underside of the once
passionate and vibrant movement.</TE>
<TE>   One e-mail on the band's Web site Saturday summarized the feelings
of a generation of fans. It read simply: "Damn ... "</TE>
<TE>   There was no announcement Saturday about funeral plans.</TE>

<HD>Gearing Up for Tests Has Pupils Seeing Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children at La Veta Elementary School in Orange have been star crazy
lately. Not for the latest Britney Spears poster or 'N Sync news, but
for little paper stars their teachers have been handing out for good
behavior or a little extra effort.</LD>
<LD>   "They earn them faster than we can make them," said school clerk
Paulette Specht, whose office resembles a Christmas display with
hundreds of yellow stars draping ceilings and walls.</LD>
<LD>   The pupils bring their stars to Specht, who trades each set of 10
for a La Veta "Star Buck," a play currency. Three Star Bucks earn a
prized invitation to a school ice pop party to be held later.</LD>
<TE>   It's all part of a campaign to remind students of and motivate
them for the grueling marathon of state-mandated tests that begin
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the next several weeks, public school students statewide will
take the Stanford 9 and the California Standards Tests.</TE>
<TE>   The results of the mostly multiple-choice exams count toward each
school's Academic Performance Index, which is used to rate schools.
Those that meet growth targets are eligible for cash awards, while
poor performers run the risk of state sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Many Orange County schools have been gearing up for the tests,
from reminding parents about the importance of their kids having a
good night's rest and a hearty breakfast, to pep rallies.</TE>
<TE>   At Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove, which met API
growth targets for the last two years, students and staff celebrated
last week with a barbecue lunch and a dunk tank, where students lined
up for a chance to soak their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The activities, Principal Gene Campbell said, are a light way to
remind students about the importance of the test. "It keeps their
eyes on the target," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at La Veta, teachers gave out bookmarks to remind
students about testing season. This year's stars have been a bigger
hit, Principal Toni Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got eight," said a proud Jacob Ansari, counting under his
desk in teacher Marianne Barone's third-grade class.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old had just earned one for focusing intently on a
spelling lesson. Earning stars is fun, but it also reminds him of
what lies ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sweating," Jacob said about taking the tests next week. "I
hope I do good."</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to do well," Barone assured him. "Because you are a
star."</TE>
<TE>   "I am a big star," Jacob said, drawing giggles from his 19
classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jacob, Zac Hemans, 9, also was a little nervous about the
exams that test students' math and language skills. The sciences are
included in tests for the upper grades. "I like the subjects," Zac
said. "I just don't like the tests."</TE>
<TE>   The tests are demanding. Depending on the grade, students take
between seven and nine hours to complete. Tests are required from
grade 2 to grade 11.</TE>
<TE>   For some high school students, doing well in the test can mean up
to $3,000 in scholarship money. Cash awards for schools can help
boost funding for programs.</TE>
<TE>   La Veta earned almost $50,000 two years ago, money that Evans used
to buy computers for all 37 classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   But Barone's students have a more immediate prize in minds--the
ice pop party that takes place after testing is completed May 3.</TE>
<TE>   Nine-year-old Mary Lester has been diligently collecting her
stars. She had 10 by Thursday, a third of the way to an ice pop.</TE>
<TE>   "At first we thought we needed three stars" instead of the 30
needed to earn three Star Bucks, Mary said.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that," said her friend Daniel Coates, 9, "would have been
really cool."</TE>

<HD>'Stoney' Jackson, 88; Conflicted Quiz-Show Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the eruptions over fraud in TV quiz shows of the 1950s, many
of the whistle-blowers were sore losers who fumbled the answers under
the unforgiving glare of studio lights.</LD>
<LD>   What history may most remember about Charles E. "Stoney" Jackson
Jr. was that he was a sore winner.</LD>
<LD>   A peripatetic minister and writer who never had much money and let
it slip through his fingers when he did, Jackson had a moment of fame
in 1956, when he won $20,000 on two of the era's top-rated
shows--"The $64,000 Question" and "The $64,000 Challenge."</LD>
<TE>   Later, he told anyone he could--including a congressional
committee--that the shows' producers fed him answers. In so doing, he
became a character in one of the decade's most disillusioning
morality tales.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who died of renal failure March 24 in Denver at age 88,
was remembered as one whose dreams and ethical views always placed
him just outside the margins of acceptability.</TE>
<TE>   He founded several organizations, including the Tennessee Sports
Hall of Fame, but lost control of them to others. He was also an
advocate for the homeless and a professional curmudgeon, who once ran
two of his dogs for president on the slogan that it was "better for a
dog to go to the White House than for the White House to go to the
dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Passion for Sports, Devotion to Christ</TE>
<TE>   The son of a clergyman, Jackson was a graduate of Transylvania
College in Kentucky, where he played football and was a welterweight
boxer. He was ordained in the Disciples of Christ Church in the early
1940s.</TE>
<TE>   After a series of ministerial positions in small Southern towns,
he returned in 1949 to his hometown of Tullahoma, Tenn., where he
developed a scheme that combined his passion for sports with his
devotion to Christ.</TE>
<TE>   He organized Tennessee high school teams in a Christian football
bowl with the goal of using the proceeds to open a home for wayward
boys. But he wound up $25,000 in debt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, CBS introduced "The $64,000 Question." It enthralled
audiences with contestants isolated in separate booths who answered
questions pulled from a vault guarded by a dark-suited banker. It was
followed a year later by "The $64,000 Challenge," which pitted the
original show's winners against new contestants.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson wrote to the producers of "The $64,000 Question" in late
1956. He offered himself as an expert on football, boxing and movie
Westerns, but failed to elicit much of a response.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he hit on a topic he felt sure would earn him the hot seat:
great lovers. The producers called back right away, but changed the
category to "great love stories."</TE>
<TE>   After cramming for 10 days, he was flown to New York, where he was
quizzed informally by producer Mert Koplin. Jackson did well enough
to go on the show that night and win a second appearance at a future
date.</TE>
<TE>   But something had rubbed him the wrong way. During his session
with Koplin, whenever he had faltered over an answer, Koplin supplied
it.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Tullahoma, he talked about his uneasiness in sermons at
church and in a speech to a local merchants' group. No one shared his
qualms. In fact, one friend told him flatly: "Shut up and don't be an
idiot!"</TE>
<TE>   So Jackson did. He returned to New York and enjoyed the free
lodging in a posh hotel and pampering by the show's staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in hog heaven," he said when he passed the $8,000 mark after
correctly answering a question about Longfellow's "Evangeline," a
question that Koplin knew he could answer correctly.</TE>
<TE>   But when he reached $16,000, the warm glow of celebrity turned
suddenly to ice. The staff stopped laughing at his jokes. They
stopped talking to him altogether.</TE>
<TE>   A young production assistant finally clued him in: The cold
shoulder was a signal to stop winning. If he ignored it, she said,
the producers would toss him a question they knew he couldn't handle
and he would be booted off the show.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson accepted the $16,000 and said goodbye on camera.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, he was rewarded with an invitation to compete on
"The $64,000 Challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Again, before show time, he met with a producer, Shirley
Bernstein, who casually began discussing great love stories.</TE>
<TE>   At one point she asked if Jackson was familiar with the author of
a 19th-century poem similar to Christopher Marlowe's "Hero and
Leander." When he said he didn't know, Bernstein told him. "It was
Thomas Hood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The question came up on Jackson's second week on the show. His
rival, a sexagenarian named Doll Goosetree, drew a blank.</TE>
<TE>   When it was Jackson's turn, he almost blurted out, "I know the
answer because Shirley Bernstein gave it to me." Instead, he gave the
correct answer and won $4,000. By the rules of the game, his reign
was over, and he left the show.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he found out from Goosetree that she had been told to bone
up on Shakespeare. Thus misled, she was bound to lose. Jackson was
outraged "because they cheated both of us," he recalled in an
interview with Associated Press in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   'Most of Us Have a Good Bit of Larceny'</TE>
<TE>   He wrote to Time magazine, the New York Times, the Nashville
Tennessean. No one was interested, not even his hometown Tullahoma
News.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a standby contestant on another CBS show, "Dotto," produced
irrefutable evidence that the current champion had been pre-fed the
answers. The show was canceled, and the dam broke.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson got to tell his story to the New York Times. Then, in
1959, he was among those called before the House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce in hearings on the quiz-show
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us," Jackson told the congressional committee, "have a
good bit of larceny in us, if we admit it, because this is an age
where a lot of respect is directed toward a man with money, and a
good deal of looking askance at the man who doesn't have it,
regardless of what his character may be."</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson returned home, he was treated as a fool and a snitch.
"A heavy aura of disgrace clung to Stoney, who somehow felt required
to apologize for his truthfulness," Los Angeles Times television
critic Howard Rosenberg wrote after interviewing Jackson on the 30th
anniversary of the congressional hearings in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Tullahomans eventually forgave Jackson. He preached in several
churches and resumed his journalism career, which included stints as
a columnist for the Tullahoma News and as editor of the Huntsville
News in Alabama and the Grundy County Herald in Tracy City, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   'I'm Always Out of Step With Society'</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s, he founded the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and
the International Churchmen's Sports Hall of Fame. A visionary with a
wretched hold on basic principles of good business, he lost control
of both groups.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pastor Richard Smith, Jackson's friend of 50 years,
the same thing happened to the Christian Athletes Foundation, which
Jackson started in the late 1940s to minister to the sports world.
"Stoney let it slip through his fingers," said Smith, who said the
foundation was taken over by others and evolved into the highly
successful Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a national athletic
ministry now based in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, after long illnesses that piled up medical
bills, Jackson's parents died. The quiz-show money was long gone. In
1978, mandatory retirement left him without a job. A year later, he
lost his house to creditors and was left homeless with his six dogs.
For a few years, he and the dogs lived in his 1971 Maverick. For part
of that time, he parked at his parents' gravesite in Tullahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson landed in Denver in 1980. He spent the next several years
in and out of homelessness. With the aid of the local ACLU, he sued
the city of Denver to give the homeless the ability to vote. The city
settled in 1986, agreeing to allow the homeless to register to vote
by designating a shelter, church or other service agency as their
legal residence.</TE>
<TE>   "He was incredibly astute politically," recalled David H. Miller,
who represented Jackson as the ACLU attorney and later became his
friend and guardian.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of his life, Jackson was better known for running his
dogs, Lady and Pirate, as write-in presidential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'm always out of step with society,'" recalled Smith.
"He had the mind of a genius, and it drove him crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's surviving dog, Little Girl, was adopted by the wife of a
Colorado politician.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two nieces, who supported him the last decade of
his life.</TE>

<HD>Vote by Striking Drivers Delayed</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A vote by striking school bus drivers on whether they will accept or
reject the latest contract offer may not happen until Monday, a union
spokesman said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Bus drivers are still looking for a place to meet for the vote,
and it doesn't appear that they will find one this weekend, Don Owens
said.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Unified School District has offered Hamilton High
School auditorium as a place for the Teamsters Union Local 572 vote,
a district representative said.</LD>
<TE>   The union is urging drivers to reject the latest offer by the
school district's transportation contractor, Laidlaw Education
Services, because leaders believe it does not offer an adequate
health-benefits package. As proposed, the health-care package would
become effective after a year of employment. Drivers want coverage
offered sooner and at a lower price.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Laidlaw drivers, who earn $8 to $15 an hour, want to be
paid the same as those employed directly by the district, who make
$13 to $24 an hour. Drivers rejected an offer last week that proposed
an average annual raise of 6.3% over three years because it didn't
offer sufficient benefits. Only two of the 415 voting members favored
it.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 800 contract drivers have been on strike since April 2,
causing problems for nearly 20,000 Los Angeles Unified students. The
district has relied on in-house transportation supervisors and
dispatchers to drive district-owned buses on routes usually served by
Laidlaw.</TE>

<LD>Criminal history is rich with wrongdoers who might have died in
obscurity if someone had not bestowed on them such flashy monikers as
the Squash Patch Murderer, Bat Man, Tiger Woman or the Torso
Murderer--all dreamed up by cops or cop reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, with a well-schooled observation and a quick turn of phrase,
investigators and reporters in the newspaper age have transformed
unknown suspects and crime scenes into virtual household names--and
elevated their crimes to headline news.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1920s, L.A.'s press gave the world the Tiger Woman after
Clara Phillips attacked her husband's lover with a claw hammer,
earning her the dramatic sobriquet.</LD>
<TE>   For eight years, in the 1920s and '30s, brassy headlines reflected
the cutthroat newspaper competition in recounting the story of secret
love and death in the "Bat Man" murder case; the killer was a
5-foot-2-inch man who lived in his lover's attic for more than a
decade before emerging to kill the woman's husband.</TE>
<TE>   The sensational 1928 "White Flame Murder" was so called because
the murderer said he saw a white flame explode in his head when he
saw his wife making love to his best friend on a piano bench. He shot
and killed both of them.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, Rattlesnake James earned that name after he bought
two snakes and set them on his pregnant wife. When she didn't die
fast enough, he drowned her in the bathtub. His luck ran out in 1942,
when he became the last man to be hanged in California.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, after years of bucking male reporters and scooping
rival newspapers, Los Angeles Herald reporter Aggie Underwood prided
herself on christening murder cases with catchy names.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment of inspiration--and calculation--she dropped a white
carnation on the body of a waitress who had been stabbed to death.
She gave the homicide a name: "The White Carnation Murder." When she
told a photographer to take a picture of her creation, a cop
objected--and Underwood smacked him with her purse.</TE>
<TE>   Other Los Angeles daily newspapers boasted of naming murder cases.
The Herald-Express named the "White Orchid Murder" and the "Red
Hibiscus Murder." It was an age of floral patterns and florid names.</TE>
<TE>   Among the best known was the 1942 beating death of 21-year-old
Jose Diaz at a Los Angeles swimming hole. A Los Angeles Examiner
reporter dubbed the killing the "Sleepy Lagoon" murder after the
title of a song by trumpeter Harry James. The case became even more
notorious for judicial misconduct and racial stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Los Angeles Daily News reporter Jack Smith--who would
later become a much-loved Times columnist--had what he later called
"my finest hour as a newspaperman."</TE>
<TE>   The body of a nude woman, cut in half, was found in a vacant lot
near USC. Working the phones, Smith found a Long Beach pharmacist who
remembered the victim, Elizabeth Short. "They called her the Black
Dahlia--on account of the way she wore her hair," the pharmacist
said. Voila--the slaying of the "Black Dahlia" remains unsolved to
this day, and still holds the power to fascinate.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1940s, wealthy, 42-year-old Van Nuys nurseryman Fred
Hills caught the public's attention after he strangled his wife,
Doris, 42, and buried her next to their house, 10 feet beneath a
squash patch.</TE>
<TE>   The "Squash Patch Murderer," as he came to be known, had learned
his wife was planning to divorce him and take her half of their
community property, so he killed her. Later, he said he never would
have confessed if "policemen hadn't pulled my hair, slapped my face
and punched me in the stomach."</TE>
<TE>   As for her body, he said, "I figured no one would ever find her
that deep, what with all the plants growing on top of her."</TE>
<TE>   Three days before Hills was to be executed, Gov. Earl Warren
commuted his sentence to life in prison; he was paroled in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   "Torso Murderer" Art Lewis Eggers, 52, wasn't so fortunate. Just
weeks after Hills' crime, Eggers beat his wife and shot her three
times, then cut off her head and hands so no one could identify her
body. He believed he was being cuckolded; she often stepped out at
dance halls.</TE>
<TE>   Eggers, a mild-mannered wannabe cop who worked as a clerk for the
Temple City sheriff's station, filed a missing persons report on his
42-year-old wife, Dorothy. But the tactic backfired when co-workers
became suspicious and found discrepancies in his report.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, a headless and handless body was found in the
San Bernardino Mountains. Reporters took to calling Hills the "Torso
Murderer."</TE>
<TE>   It took a Temple City doctor and Dorothy's bespectacled dance
partner--whom the Herald-Express dubbed "dancing daddy"--to identify
the torso by a scar on her shin and by her unsightly bunions.</TE>
<TE>   Eggers eventually admitted killing her. But, even until the last,
he denied cutting off her head and hands. He was executed in the gas
chamber on Oct. 15, 1948. The body parts were never found.</TE>
<TE>   Code nicknames for bank robbers go back a long way. Lloyd E.
Sampsel gained notoriety as the "yacht bandit" because he and members
of his gang used a yacht as a hide-out after robbing several gambling
ships off the California coast in the 1920s and '30s.</TE>
<TE>   While Sampsel was serving a life sentence at Folsom Prison in
1943, four unauthorized visits with his wife in San Francisco--with
the help of bribed prison guards--touched off a sensational
investigation of the prison administration. His moniker stuck for
almost three decades. After his release, he killed a Chula Vista man
in a bank robbery. He was executed on May 25, 1952.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several decades, veteran FBI agent and gangster buff
Bill Rehder has spent several minutes each day dreaming up nicknames
for the cast of characters who once made the Southland the bank
robbery capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The "Clearasil Bandit," a robber with a bad complexion, made
noises about suing the FBI for libel for the humiliating dig at his
acne. His attorney, David Bartick, refused to handle that suit,
saying: "It could have been worse. He could have been called the B.O.
Bandit"--a reference to another bank robber with that name and
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the holdup artist who crafted atrociously spelled demand
notes announcing: "This is a rabbry," and warning bank tellers not to
"pull anytrix." He was sarcastically dubbed the "Post-Graduate
Bandit."</TE>
<TE>   "Large Marge" was a foulmouthed woman who shouted obscenities as
she robbed more than 30 banks, and "Miss Piggy" was a 5-foot-4,
200-pound-plus woman who made her getaways in a Volkswagen Beetle.</TE>
<TE>   The man dubbed the "Polite Bank Robber" often waited patiently in
line, letting others cut in front of him, before holding up the
teller. He never displayed a gun or injured anyone, but still got 15
years to brush up on his manners.</TE>
<TE>   Star-conscious Los Angeles also has had its share of celebrity
look-alikes: Tina Turner and Groucho Marx Bandits. Other nicknames
bestowed on Southern California holdup artists include the Nerd, Baby
Huey, the Mummy Bandit, the Troll, the Shamu Bandit, Miss
America--for a pretty woman--the Pervert and the Pistol-Packin'
Priest.</TE>

<HD>Quaint Town Is Also Hip</HD>
<DH>Culture: Arts-loving urban transplants cultivate a sense of
community, as in fund- raiser for fire victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEVADA CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Julie Toste, wearing her blue Friar Tuck's apron, nodded at the heaps
of chipped brick and the heavy equipment in front of her. "My floor
has changed a little bit," she said dryly.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant in which she worked as floor manager, Friar Tuck's,
is now a fenced-off demolition site. The rustic local hangout was
consumed by a fire that gutted a beloved corner of this old gold
mining town, but not its historic pluck.</LD>
<LD>   Toste and dozens of others who lost a place to work or perform in
the March 20 blaze have each received a $400 check to make up for
lost wages, and more is on the way. The money is not from
unemployment or other insurance; it is from the people of Nevada City
and the surrounding area, who have dug $60,000 out of their own
pockets to help.</LD>
<TE>   If such compassion seems archetypically small town, this place in
the Sierra foothills northeast of Sacramento is not. It is
tiny--population 3,001--out in the woods and has a quaint downtown.
But it is a village of urban transplants who are fond of the theater,
a nice glass of wine and historic preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Toste, a Los Angeles expatriate who worked at Tuck's for 12 years,
was taking a break recently from helping at an all-day fund-raiser,
nicknamed "Firestock."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly as many people as live in Nevada City crowded into a 19th
century stone foundry for nine hours of performances by Nevada
County's sizable arts community. There were poetry readings, dance
presentations and music of just about every genre, from classical to
folk and alternative rock. Local restaurants donated food and
libations. The admission price was whatever you wanted it to be. Half
of the fire fund's $60,000 was raised in a day.</TE>
<TE>   The relief effort reflects Nevada City's carefully cultivated
sense of community. Even though nearly everyone is from someplace
else, they like to act otherwise. People moved here, said former San
Diegan Philip Sneed, "because they wanted to be part of a community
that is small enough to be manageable, small enough to feel they can
make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Sneed is artistic director of the local Foothill Theatre Company.
Ellen Davies, who left her health foundation job and came here with
her husband in 1995, is president of the local Rotary Club and
executive director of a community cultural center housed in the
foundry. She belongs to a quilting group filled with women from the
Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   "People just wanted a different life," she said, explaining why
she and others chose this out-of-the-way town on the edge of the
Tahoe National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada City is a place of urbane sensibilities and small-town
looks. The streets wind past 19th century brick storefronts and white
clapboard houses. There are wine-tasting rooms, cafe patios,
bookstores named Harmony and Inner Sanctum, and small theater
companies.</TE>
<TE>   And there are a lot of tourists. But although they can inspect the
scene from a horse-drawn carriage, Nevada City has managed to avoid
studied preciousness. Tattooed bikers roar down Broad Street on day
trips into the mountains. Hints of hippiedom and an occasional
ramshackle house keep excessive tidiness at bay.</TE>
<TE>   Thrown up in the manic days of the Gold Rush, Nevada City boomed
to nearly 50,000 residents and shrank just as quickly. Hard-rock gold
mining and logging kept it alive until the middle of the last
century, when the mines closed during World War II. By the 1950s,
storefronts had been boarded up and the town was withering.</TE>
<TE>   Hippies came to the rescue in the late '60s, followed by retirees,
artists and urban refugees working in a Silicon Valley outpost that
sprang up around neighboring Grass Valley. High-tech engineers from
the Bay Area started moving here decades ago, and the area is the
birthplace of the modems used to connect to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, telecommuters have begun to arrive with young
families. Though the county population, now about 92,000, has
increased steadily since 1980, there is a strong anti-growth movement
powered by relative newcomers who like the place as they found it.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's fire was one of many that have struck Nevada City
since its inception. The predawn blaze was limited to half a block.
But it was a cherished half-block that catered to body and mind.
Along with Tuck's, the corner was home to the Herb Shop, several
smaller businesses and the cabaret-style Off Broadstreet Theatre,
which had spent its entire 13-year history on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   People would dine at Tuck's, go next door for dessert and musical
comedy at Off Broadstreet and then return to Tuck's bar for a
nightcap. "We all have a history at Friar Tuck's," said Gil Mathew,
who moved here two decades ago from Orange County and runs a
manufacturing firm.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant and bar were opened 29 years ago by Greg Cook, who
with his wife, Rona, operated them as Nevada City's living room, an
unpretentious place of wood and booths, birthday celebrations, prom
dinners and live music. Locals and tourists washed down steaks and
fondue with California wine from a 5,000-plus-bottle cellar that
stocked an award-winning wine list. Like everything else in Tuck's,
it was incinerated.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a death," Cook says of Tuck's destruction. "Yeah,"
added his wife, "except we can resurrect it." They have insurance and
intend to reopen on the same spot, as does Off Broadstreet.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the 62 waitresses, musicians, actors and
salesclerks who lost their jobs in the blaze will each get about
$1,000 from the fire fund. The response has been so overwhelming that
Mikail Graham, a relief coordinator, confessed that he has wondered,
"Have we gone too far?"</TE>
<TE>   He decided not. The public "wanted to help and they kept sending
money," he said as the wood-beamed foundry filled with people and
music. "We wanted to take care of our own because we can."</TE>

<HD>City Fears Train Plan Is Runaway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Clemente officials and residents fear that the state is rushing
ahead with plans to send more and faster trains along the city's
fragile beach despite environmental concerns and fierce community
opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Several transportation agencies are considering adding a second
set of tracks along the beach-side right of way, a key upgrade for
Los Angeles-to-San Diego train service.</LD>
<LD>   The additional tracks would allow more freight and passenger
trains to travel faster and with fewer delays.</LD>
<TE>   One of the options considered by Caltrans would have two sets of
tracks at ground level, with trains traveling up to 90 mph where
beachgoers cross on foot. The other option would be to build a tunnel
under Interstate 5 for the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ludicrous," said San Clemente Councilwoman Susan Ritschel.
"Neither alternative is going to be feasible, and the coastal route
doesn't make sense from an environmental, safety or community
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   An overflow crowd of several hundred people showed up at a recent
Caltrans public hearing on the plan. The unexpectedly large turnout
has prompted Caltrans to schedule another meeting at 6 Tuesday night
at Heritage Christian Fellowship Church, 190 Avenida La Pata.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Stephanie Dorey said she believes Caltrans is hoping
to get quick approval for the coastal double-tracking option, which
would be much cheaper than building a tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   The California High-Speed Rail Authority is also considering plans
to add tracks through San Clemente. Dan Leavitt, deputy director of
the authority, said there is a lot of misunderstanding among city
officials and residents about the various studies.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of upset and angry people [at the public
hearing] because they thought a decision had been made," Leavitt
said. "But it has not."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente residents and city officials have been fighting to
get the tracks off the beach for years and fiercely oppose anything
that would add to the rail traffic there. City officials worry that
more trains will lead to more accidents involving pedestrians and
destabilize the coastal bluffs next to the right of way.</TE>
<TE>   Ritschel said she wants the agencies to consider a third option:
routing Los Angeles-to-San Diego train traffic along a new inland
route.</TE>

<HD>Seeking to Remove Scars of Violence</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: A national network has been set up to treat
children whose post-traumatic stress often goes undiagnosed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a walk to the corner store is a luxury that Anthony does not
have anymore. He's too afraid to leave his house alone. He hasn't
been able to make it through the night in months without nightmares
piercing his sleep. The 16-year-old can't even concentrate on his
schoolwork because the same gruesome scene keeps invading his brain.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony--whose name and some others in this story have been
changed to protect them--was sitting outside his Long Beach home
several months ago, not far from where some guys were talking to a
friend of his. He says he recognized the other boys as gang members.
But that's no big deal in his--boom, boom, boom. Gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   His friend fell down, shot right in front of him. "Run!" Anthony
told himself. But he was in shock; his body wouldn't move.</LD>
<TE>   His friend died the next day. And Anthony, although not physically
harmed, can't seem to get over his fear.</TE>
<TE>   Many youths like Anthony who grow up in the country's most
crime-ridden neighborhoods experience such terror that psychological
and physiological trauma can continue long after the shooting stops,
medical experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The problem often goes undiagnosed and, with a shortage of
specialized counseling, untreated. Now, however, that may change,
with a recent increase in money and attention being devoted to the
study and treatment of such child trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, $10 million in federal funds helped establish a
national network of 18 universities and medical centers to study
child trauma from violence and other causes, improve its treatment
and expand the availability of counseling. The National Child
Traumatic Stress Network includes three centers in the Los Angeles
area and one in San Francisco. Still, doctors say more can be done.</TE>
<TE>   The network's research effort is headed by a collaboration between
UCLA and Duke University in North Carolina. Grants of $340,000 were
awarded to Children's Institute International in the Wilshire
District to create a community-based center to treat the city's
immigrant populations and to Miller Children's Hospital Abuse and
Violence Intervention Center in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major national commitment to improving the care of
traumatized children across all different types of trauma," said Dr.
Alan Steinberg, associate director of the National Center for Child
Traumatic Stress at UCLA, which also will study children exposed to
natural disasters, war, terrorism, abuse and serious accidents.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many Americans temporarily
experienced post-traumatic stress, evidenced by fear of airplanes and
public gatherings. But the trauma suffered by children in gang
neighborhoods is especially powerful, psychologists say, because the
violence is continuing, it's in their own communities and sometimes
it's right before their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact on the child goes well beyond their post-traumatic
reactions, which themselves are pretty bad," Steinberg said. "A lot
of this violence has a pernicious effect on their daily lives."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony, for example, was so afraid of the gang that he didn't go
to school for two weeks after the shooting. "I just want to stay in
the house," he said, "because I feel like they're coming to get me."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling is normal, said Anthony's therapist, Sara Dickes, a
psychologist at Miller Children's Hospital. Its Abuse and Violence
Intervention Center provides treatment, individually and in groups at
some Long Beach Unified elementary schools, to children traumatized
by violence.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Cheryl Lanktree, director of the center, said adolescents
scarred by violence react by becoming more aggressive or withdrawn.
They can be more irritable, show a numbness toward activities, be
disruptive in class, get into fights at school or let their grades
slide, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time, the teachers just think it's a bad kid,"
Dickes said. "It's just one of those kids who need to be sent to the
principal's office."</TE>
<TE>   Trauma can even affect a child's nervous system, making it more
sensitive to stimuli, UCLA's Steinberg said. Anthony cringes whenever
he hears a dog bark.</TE>
<TE>   Techniques to Help Children Open Up</TE>
<TE>   In therapy, psychologists use different techniques, including
having children draw pictures or write letters, to get them to open
up. Since Anthony began his weekly sessions at the center, he has
felt a little better. "I get to come out of the house every once in a
while," he said. "And I get to have someone to talk to about it."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever he told his mother that he feared for his life, she said
gang members would have killed him already if they were really after
him. But Anthony wasn't convinced. After all, violence seemed to
follow him.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting on his block occurred shortly after he moved there
from downtown Long Beach, where someone threw a brick through his
neighbor's window, then proceeded to shoot up the place. "I was
scared because it was just so close," Anthony said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach is no stranger to violence. There were 49 homicides in
the city of 438,000 people last year, while San Francisco, with
almost double the population at 802,000, had 46.</TE>
<TE>   According to the most recent statistics from the National Center
for Children Exposed to Violence, in 1997 about 4 million 12- to
17-year-olds were victims of a serious physical assault and 5 million
more witnessed serious violence. A recent Los Angeles Unified School
District screening of more than 1,000 students at 11 schools showed
that 36% had witnessed life-threatening violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad part is that a lot of them see it as the way it's
supposed to be, a way of life," said Dr. Kathleen Watkins, a
psychologist at the Miller center.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia, 16, gets counseling there. Every day, she wishes that
violence had not become part of her life. Sometimes, she wishes she
had been killed instead of her father.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia said her dad must have been coming home from work. She was
inside when she heard gunshots that sounded close. From a window, she
watched a car in the driveway of her home near downtown Los Angeles
roll into a garage pole. It wasn't until she went outside that she
realized it was her father's car.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia knew he had been shot, but couldn't tell where. Blood
soaked his shirt and head and spurted out his mouth when he tried to
answer her question: "Who did this?" Claudia never got an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Now she can't get the image out of her head.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I see a car crash, I think it's my dad's car and I think
my dad's in it," Claudia said. No matter how many photographs she
sees of her father smiling and laughing, the sight of him bleeding in
the car is the one she remembers.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg said that phenomenon is called traumatic bereavement.
"The mind is drawn to the circumstance of the death, and it makes it
difficult to remember the person in a positive way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia often daydreams in class about what she would be doing if
her father were alive. That's if she can sit through an entire class
without getting annoyed at her teachers.</TE>
<TE>   She also has noticed that she's more argumentative. "I like to say
whatever I feel," Claudia said. "I just became different; I'm not the
same person. Now that my dad's not here, I don't even know if I'm
sad, anxious, angry [or] lonely."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the hardest part is not knowing who killed her father. She
finds herself staring down men with bald heads and baggy clothes,
wondering whether they're the ones she saw fleeing her house that
night. If she had only caught them, she thinks. Instead, Claudia
said, "You take that anger out at anyone that's around you."</TE>
<TE>   Other counseling centers in the Los Angeles area are trying to
prevent child trauma from triggering another round of violence,
particularly in the inner city. One such project is the County-USC
Medical Center Violence Intervention Program. Another is the Family
Life Center at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in
Willowbrook, which in 1999 began an after-school program teaching
anger management, conflict resolution and leadership skills to 7- to
12-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "If we expose our children to positive intervention, then it will
reduce violence," said Marilyn Al-Hassan, director of the Family Life
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Shahrzad Bazargan, the center's evaluator, said the violence
doesn't have to be directly witnessed to have negative repercussions.
"Our kids are woken up in the middle of the night because of police
sirens and helicopter activity," she said. "Their work is going to be
affected by this."</TE>
<TE>   Parents' Role in Getting Help Stressed</TE>
<TE>   The important thing is realizing when your child needs help, said
John, the father of a 13-year-old boy whose mother was shot to death
when he was 4. He watched his son come home from school after getting
into fight after fight and still didn't know what was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I played his aggression as him being an aggressive, competitive
type of guy," he said, because John Jr. played sports. It started to
make sense when he overheard John Jr.'s stepbrothers teasing the boy
about his mother's absence. John Jr.'s mother was found lying dead in
the street five blocks from her house in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "She used to come put me in bed and read a story," John Jr. said.
"When I was 7 or 8, I wondered where she was." As he realized that
his mother was never coming back, he said, "I just pulled my head
under my covers and cried [myself] to sleep."</TE>
<TE>   John put his son in therapy with the Miller center's Watkins. The
youth learned to deal with his anger, and eventually the fights
stopped and his grades improved.</TE>
<TE>   He said it felt good to talk about his feelings. "I wasn't holding
it in anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins had John Jr. compose a series of letters to his dead

wrote: "Dear Mom, I was scared of you dying because I wanted you to
be a part of my life until it was time for you to die. Love, John."</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Son, I'm sorry, but it was something that had to happen. It
was my fault and I'm sorry for not being able to come see you when
you play football. I really wanted to be there for you. Love, Mom."</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Mom, As I write these letters it does not make me think of
you that much. I am starting to get used to it. Love, John."</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Son, I am so proud of you. I think that it is time for you
to stop thinking about me and go on with your life. Love, Mom."</TE>

<AU>MIKE CARONA</AU>
<BD>Mike Carona is sheriff of Orange County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The preliminary report on the 2001 California Crime Index, which
measures homicides, rapes, assaults, robberies, burglaries, vehicle
thefts and arson, was recently released by the state attorney
general's office. As expected, the findings demonstrate the trend of
low crime rates throughout the state at levels not seen since the
mid-1960s.</LD>
<LD>   A rise of 5.8% in the state over the previous year was reported.
But taken in context, and considering fluctuations due to economic,
social or demographic reasons, the citizens of California enjoy a
consistently high level of security and safety.</LD>
<LD>   Most cities in Orange County also reported a slight comparable
rise, but the unincorporated areas patrolled by the Sheriff's
Department enjoyed a 22% drop in crime. The release of the
preliminary report provides an opportune time to report on the state
of law enforcement in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The readiness, professionalism and effectiveness of your deputy
sheriffs and police officers are at unprecedented levels as they
prepare to meet the demands of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   The last few years have brought about new and sometimes
frightening concerns. We observed an effective and large-scale
terrorist attack on the United States on Sept. 11, the use of
bioterrorism and a startling rise in campus-related violence.</TE>
<TE>   You can take a great deal of assurance, however, that Orange
County's law enforcement professionals are better trained and
equipped as never before and ready to meet the challenges that lie
ahead. A revolutionary effort is transforming law enforcement in the
state of California.</TE>
<TE>   Community-oriented policing techniques are now standard operating
procedures, providing proactive law enforcement service and response
to our citizens. Increased state funding and $358 million in grant
funds have added front-line law enforcement personnel to our streets,
increased the scope and effectiveness of basic and advanced officer
training, and provided the foundation for law enforcement excellence
in the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   A realization of the causes of crime and social problems has
welded law enforcement and other agencies and community groups into
working partnerships to increase effectiveness. The Sheriff's
Department recently entered into a landmark venture with school
districts to provide threat assessment and intervention services to
schools throughout the county.</TE>
<TE>   Our efforts to combat school violence and provide effective
juvenile diversion services were made possible by $358 million in new
state funding. Cooperation and facilitation are core philosophies
held by the law enforcement community of this new century.</TE>
<TE>   Technological innovation is sweeping through all facets of life in
California. Law enforcement in Orange County is benefiting directly
from the advances of the last decades. A new state-of-the-art coroner
and forensics sciences facility is under construction in Santa Ana.
New weaponry, including less lethal and nonlethal types, has been
added to most departments. Computerization and information systems
are greatly improved.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and the members of the Legislature are to be
recognized for their leadership to bolster the effectiveness and
professionalism of law enforcement in the state of California.</TE>
<TE>   More than $100 million has been invested by Davis and the
legislature in upgrading forensic facilities throughout the state.
Their actions have also been instrumental in obtaining $146 million
for high-technology equipment for local law enforcement agencies and
$50 million to clear backlogged DNA testing for unsolved sexual
assault cases.</TE>
<TE>   The men and women who patrol our streets, investigate crimes and
provide critical intervention are better than they have ever been.
The citizens of Orange County can take pride in the skills and
abilities of their deputy sheriffs and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   The profession of maintaining the peace, preserving life and
protecting property will continue to advance as long as we recognize
the vital necessity of mutual cooperation and understanding.</TE>
<TE>   The interaction and collaboration of citizens and local
government, local and state leaders, and law enforcement agencies and
the community are essential to addressing the needs of our great
nation. We must all continue to strive for excellence.</TE>

<HD>Raising Grades Under Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SMITH</AU>
<BD>Steve Smith, a father of two schoolchildren, writes
from Costa Mesa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rebounding economy may or may not be robust enough to save
California's education program from budget cuts. But regardless of
whether the budget remains the same, the time has come for educators
to implement two very inexpensive, proven methods of increasing both
grades and test scores.</LD>
<LD>   The first is to help our children get more sleep. A recent study
conducted at Brown University on teenage sleep habits shows that
teenagers are often tired because of their inability to fall asleep
early. The study says that the levels of the hormone
melatonin--produced by the pineal gland to regulate the body's sleep
cycle--rise during the evening and abate during the morning.</LD>
<LD>   In teens, melatonin is not produced until late at night, so they
do not fall asleep early enough because they do not feel the symptoms
of sleepiness. Other factors can cause sleep deprivation in
teenagers, including television, school sports, extracurricular
activities, school work and after-school jobs.</LD>
<TE>   The average amount of sleep a teenager needs is 9.2 hours. Studies
indicate that 26% of students receive about 6.5 hours on average. A
study conducted in Rhode Island showed that 85% of students who were
chronically sleep-deprived developed a sleep deficit in which their
bodies cannot function properly. This is a threat not only to
teenagers' health but to academic performance.</TE>
<TE>   Johns Hopkins University showed that students who were deprived of
sleep received lower grades than those who received more sleep.
Depriving the body of adequate sleep night after night has a profound
effect on a child's growth and development.</TE>
<TE>   One of the common misconceptions about sleep is that the body is
at rest, but just the opposite is true. While kids are sleeping, the
body is producing and replenishing the key hormones and other
chemicals that promote growth and a strong immune system.</TE>
<TE>   It is during the night that the mind becomes a hard drive where
memories are processed and stored. So teachers, if you want your
students to do a better job remembering what you teach them each day,
all you may have to do is help them get more sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The second cheap way to raise grades and test scores is to
initiate a full-blown "no-TV" program in the schools. Studies have
documented the positive effects of a TV-free life. Without TV, kids
read more, play more and converse more with their parents, just to
name a few benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Our two kids, 9 and 12, have not watched television in more than
three years and they don't miss it a bit. And yes, when kids don't
watch TV, grades and test scores rise dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   (By the way, national TV-Turnoff Week, a program that encourages
people to do something else, begins Monday.)</TE>
<TE>   School districts have the complete freedom that is required for
these programs and the tiny budget that calls for cheap solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Both have more immediate and long-term effects on grades and test
scores than, for example, class-size reduction. But neither plan is
likely to be embraced any time soon, and that leaves this parent
wondering why.</TE>

<HD>Oil Drilling Debate Turns to 2nd Alaska Site</HD>
<DH>Ecology: Exploration has begun at the North Slope tract. Activists
worry about wildlife.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>While the Bush administration appears to have lost its bid to open
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, the Interior
Department is preparing to allow oil leasing on an even larger tract of
pristine coastal land on the other side of Alaska's North Slope.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the refuge, the 9.6 million acres within the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska, west of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, would not require
further congressional approval before oil and gas exploration could
expand in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton has ordered federal land managers to
move quickly to expand leasing within the reserve, where the oil industry
found potentially significant deposits during an initial lease sale on
4.6 million acres opened for exploration in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   The amount of oil underlying the reserve won't be known until May,
when the U.S. Geological Survey completes its study, though the
quantities are likely much less than what the Arctic refuge holds. A
draft environmental impact statement on expanded leasing in the reserve
is due to be completed at the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The reserve is the summer home to millions of migratory birds, the
largest lake in the American Arctic and half a million caribou. With 23.5
million acres, the NPRA is the largest tract of undeveloped land in North
America. It has not galvanized opponents the way the proposal to open up
2,000 acres in ANWR has because it is not a designated wildlife refuge
and because its wide sweep of tundra can potentially accommodate wildlife
and oil wells more easily than the narrow ribbon of coast in the Arctic
refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "The NPRA doesn't get the level of attention for developing areas of
protection that it should, primarily because a lot of the attention is
focused on trying to protect the Arctic refuge," said Deb Moore of the
Northern Alaska Environmental Center.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, center officials said in a recent report, "a vast
wildlands in Alaska's western Arctic stands to be defaced and irrevocably
transfigured."</TE>
<TE>Clinton Administration Got the Ball Rolling</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration started recent exploration within the
reserve, signing leases on 1 million acres in the northeastern section
nearest the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields in 1999. At the time,
there was speculation that the move could help take development pressure
off the Arctic refuge, 100 miles to the east.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration has moved forward on both fronts, citing
the nation's dependence on volatile foreign oil suppliers. As early as
June 3, the federal Bureau of Land Management will reopen the
4.6-million-acre northeast quadrant originally offered for leasing in
1999, confident that recent oil discoveries there will boost interest in
about 3 million acres still available.</TE>
<TE>   The petroleum reserve was created in 1923 as a source of oil for the
U.S. naval fleet. President Ford transferred management to the Department
of Interior in 1976, with special provisions for protecting natural
resources in two of its most stunning areas: Teshekpuk Lake and the
Colville River bluffs, a major nesting area for peregrine falcon and
other raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Both are considered world-class wildlife areas. Up to a quarter of the
Pacific flyway population of brant (33,000 were counted one year) molt
near the lake, and up to 27,000 Canada geese have been counted in some
years. Both areas were largely set aside during the 1999 lease sales.</TE>
<TE>   But conservation groups say there are areas elsewhere in the reserve
that also deserve protection because of their importance as wildlife
habitats or archeological treasures (evidence of human habitation in this
part of the Arctic dates back 11,000 years).</TE>
<TE>   "The ecological integrity of the North Slope is at serious risk from
unplanned, piecemeal and damaging development. The most biologically rich
and recognized wildlife and wilderness values of the region are not
permanently protected," those groups told the Bureau of Land Management.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups have also raised concerns about moose, gray
wolves, grizzly bears, polar bears, seals and beluga whales that depend
on the reserve, along with the 400,000 to 450,000 caribou of the Western
Arctic herd, the largest in America. The herd's concentrated calving area
lies mostly along the southwest border of the area proposed for oil
drilling in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Audubon Alaska and other groups have urged the bureau to invest in
comprehensive studies now to allow oil development to proceed in a way
that would protect the reserve's most important resources.</TE>
<TE>   "NPRA was set up a long time ago as a petroleum reserve, so we don't
have the same political and legal opportunities to try and protect a vast
area of it," said Stan Senner of Audubon Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest concern is that, down the road 25 years from now, there
will be this willy-nilly spider web of development all across the NPRA,
connected by roads or pipelines," Senner said.</TE>
<TE>   Oil, for example, is not the only resource within the NPRA. The
reserve also contains large quantities of hard-rock minerals and the
nation's largest deposit of coal.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Terland, the BLM's acting associate state director in Alaska,
said the agency is in the process of drafting alternative development
scenarios that will look at protection of wild and scenic rivers,
subsistence issues and wildlife resources. But oil and gas leasing will
be "the primary activity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oil development of the petroleum reserve has been an option since
Congress approved it in 1980. Some conservation groups have filed a
lawsuit arguing that the BLM needs further congressional authority to
open new leases, though Congress has so far shown little inclination to
revisit the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Industry interest was scant in the 1980s. Studies showed relatively
small quantities of oil there, and getting to it--miles from the existing
infrastructure at Prudhoe Bay--was expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since then, though. Oil development has marched
progressively westward from Prudhoe Bay. In November 2000, Phillips
Alaska and Anadarko Petroleum began production on the Alpine oil field on
the Colville River, just outside the eastern boundary of the NPRA. They
expect to recover 429 million barrels of oil there.</TE>
<TE>   Alpine is the first major field with no permanent, cross-tundra access
roads; it is served by winter-only ice roads and an airstrip. But the
internal roads, airstrip and residential facilities there make it easier
for oil companies to consider bidding on lands that are only 15 to 25
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, in an announcement that sent shock waves through the oil
industry because the NPRA before had shown so little promise, Phillips
said it had struck oil in five of six wells drilled over the previous two
seasons in the NPRA. How much oil it discovered has not been revealed,
but the signs are it could be as big a find as Alpine.</TE>
<TE>   As oil development begins to probe the outer reaches of the North
Slope, the logistical challenges are becoming formidable. During the
debate on ANWR on Capitol Hill, industry officials pledged they could
limit damage to Arctic wildlife and tundra by restricting exploration to
the winter and hauling in equipment over temporary ice roads.</TE>
<TE>   But parts of the NPRA may be too far for ice roads, BLM officials say.
"This stuff way out there, you're looking at whole new logistical
challenges there," bureau spokesman Ed Bovy said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Phillips built about 30 miles of ice roads within the NPRA
and went a step further, opening a wildcat well known as Hunter 52 miles
past the end of the farthest ice road. The drilling rig and associated
equipment were hauled in on a monstrous, soft-wheeled vehicle known as a
Rolligon, capable of moving over roadless snow. It took 188 trips, eight
hours each, to move an estimated 5.5 million pounds of equipment to the
Hunter drilling site.</TE>
<TE>   Developing more efficient ways of operating on ice roads is crucial.
Yet, because of changes in the Arctic climate, the window for operating
in the winter months is becoming smaller all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we've been keeping records, the winter drilling season [with
solid snow cover on the tundra] has dropped from 200 days to an average
over the last five years of 122 days," said Larry Diedrick, director of
oil spill prevention and response for Alaska's Department of
Environmental Conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Oil companies, which used to be able to start ice road construction in
early November, this year weren't allowed to begin until March. Rigs had
to be hauled in, set up, operated and dismantled by April 20. "If the
trend is going to continue this way, the whole basis for doing the
drilling work in the winter is going to be undermined," Diedrick said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the federal government has pledged not to allow any new
exploration that involves gravel roads, which leave a scar on the fragile
tundra, even decades after oil activity has ceased. But, Diedrick
cautions, "as you move across NPRA, it forces us to look at gravel roads
again."</TE>
<TE>   Sara Callaghan Chappell, the Sierra Club's Arctic coordinator in
Alaska, points out that even ice roads need further evaluation. Oil
companies are drawing millions of gallons of water out of Arctic lakes
and streams for every mile of ice road constructed--along with billions
of gallons used in pumping operations, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't taken a good look at how we're changing the hydrologic
features of the North Slope. I guess we're crossing our fingers and
hoping it'll all turn out OK."</TE>

<HD>Pope Stresses Importance of Celibate Life for Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II on Saturday strongly upheld the rule that Roman
Catholic priests must lead celibate lives. He ordered bishops to
"diligently investigate" charges of sexual misbehavior by clergymen and
take "firm steps to correct it."</LD>
<LD>   John Paul did not mention the American clergy. But his remarks, made
to Nigerian bishops visiting the Vatican, were his most direct on the
subject since clerical sex abuse scandals began shaking the church in the
United States early this year. He spoke three days before the start of an
extraordinary meeting with American cardinals to discuss the scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said last week that he would
press the pope and other Vatican officials at the two-day meeting to open
discussion of a married priesthood.</LD>
<TE>   But the pope made it clear Saturday that celibacy, a cornerstone of
the priesthood for nearly 900 years and a symbol of ordained holiness, is
not up for discussion at the meeting, or any other time.</TE>
<TE>   "The value of celibacy as a complete gift of self to the Lord and his
church must be carefully safeguarded," the pope said. "The life of
chastity, poverty and obedience willingly embraced and faithfully lived
confutes the conventional wisdom of the world and challenges the commonly
accepted vision of life."</TE>
<TE>   Sex scandals in America, in which numerous priests have been accused
of abusing children and teenagers, have shaken the faith of American
Catholics, cost the church millions of dollars in settlements and raised
questions about American bishops' handling of investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials have been slow to respond, and the pope's previous
remarks on the issue have been oblique and delicate. In a pre-Easter
letter to priests, he lamented the "dark shadow of suspicion" cast over
the entire clergy by "some of our brothers who have betrayed the grace of
ordination."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, he prayed in a homily at St. Peter's "for those priestly
brothers . . . who have not lived up to the commitment they made when
they were ordained, or who are going through a period of difficulty and
crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's papal message, though it did not mention sex offenders or
pedophilia, was a more forceful call for discipline, evidently addressed
to the American cardinals as well as John Paul's Nigerian audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Behavior which might give scandal must be carefully avoided," the
pope said, "and you yourselves must diligently investigate accusations of
any such behavior, taking firm steps to correct it where it is found to
exist."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that the church should address the problem more openly.</TE>
<TE>   "It is of the utmost importance," he said, "that openness, honesty and
transparency should always be the hallmark of everything that the church
does."</TE>
<TE>   American bishops, including some of the 13 cardinals who will meet the
pope, have been accused of covering up misconduct by priests, in some
cases by moving known sex abusers from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to shore up their credibility and moral leadership, the
cardinals will be looking to the pope for guidance and support on a range
of possible solutions, including a uniform American policy for reporting
sex abuse claims to the police. They will also grapple with the question
of whether the church should stop reassigning sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul did not mention such approaches. But he called for a new
emphasis on seminary training to address potential problems.</TE>
<TE>   "As true fathers," he said, "the spiritual renewal and growth of your
priests must be among your top priorities."</TE>
<TE>   He also reminded priests that they are supposed to live austere lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Priests and candidates for the priesthood often live at a level both
materially and educationally superior to that of their families and the
members of their own age group," he said. "It is therefore very easy for
them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better
than others.</TE>
<TE>   "When this happens," he added, "the ideal of priestly service and
self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and
disheartened." Priests must instead imitate Christ's "complete
self-giving for the sake of the flock and the advancement of the
Kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   The sex abuse scandal has prompted debate in the United States about
whether allowing a married clergy would reduce instances of clerical sex
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is the first American cardinal to call for open discussion of a
married priesthood since the current spate of scandals, although he says
he is not necessarily in favor of one.</TE>
<TE>   Some Vatican officials have also said celibacy should be discussed
with the cardinals, but only to help them figure out how to better stress
to seminarians the roots and rationale of the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas J. Reese, a New York-based theologian who edits the
Jesuit magazine America, said the pope's remarks Saturday confirmed that
this week's meeting "will not result in any widening of the discussion to
include optional celibacy. That's not going to happen with these
cardinals or with this pope. He's made himself perfectly clear, and this
crisis is not going to change his mind on that."</TE>
<TE>   Reese noted that other cardinals support the celibacy rule and do not
believe that changing it will solve the sex abuse problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Celibacy doesn't turn people into sexual maniacs," he said. "We have
lots of sex abuse out there done by married men."</TE>

<HD>Top French TV Drama Is Behind the Scenes</HD>
<DH>Media: Firing of Canal Plus channel's chairman is seen as an attack
on creativity led by a renegade countryman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>One is a Saturday matinee popcorn movie replete with bare-chested
musclemen, deadly swordplay, scantily attired damsels and ancient desert
kingdoms vividly created through the magic of 21st century computer
graphics.</LD>
<LD>   The other is an irreverent Muppet-like pay television show that takes
delight in skewering the French ruling class with scathing wit and nimble
political humor.</LD>
<LD>   Both are products of global entertainment giant Vivendi Universal.</LD>
<TE>   But in their vast differences, the new action film "The Scorpion King"
that hit American megaplexes this weekend and the French TV program "Les
Guignols de l'Info" vividly illustrate the wide gap between Hollywood and
French culture.</TE>
<TE>   It is this gap that has fueled tensions between Vivendi Universal and
its pay television unit, Canal Plus, sparking a protest last week that
sent about 1,000 people onto the street near the Champs-Elysees, inspired
passionate editorials in leading newspapers, prompted movie stars to sign
petitions and worked its way into the debate leading up to today's
presidential election--all over the firing of an executive at France's
money-losing pay TV channel.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout over the firing of Pierre Lescure, the chairman of Canal
Plus, is expected to intensify this week, with the Vivendi annual
shareholder meeting in Paris on Wednesday. Canal Plus employees are
planning a strike to protest the firing of Lescure by another Frenchman,
Vivendi Universal's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the drama is a predictable reminder of the resistance to
globalization that periodically surfaces in country after country as
trade barriers come down. But the howl that went up in France after
Messier axed Lescure is, in many ways, unique to this country, where
French culture is jealously guarded and the encroachment of Hollywood
movies and television is viewed with some alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the dumping of Lescure was seen as an attack on a bastion of
French creativity and independence by corporate sharks--led by a fellow
countryman, no less--intent on spreading crass, bottom-line materialism.</TE>
<TE>   "French product and French films do well in France while other
European countries are overwhelmed with Hollywood product," said Moritz
Borman, chief executive of Intermedia, a Los Angeles-based film financing
company with European roots. "They see Messier as Americanizing a French
institution. They view it as, 'This Americanized person that has left us
is now messing with French cinema.' That is what everybody is worrying
about."</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus is the leading pay television channel in continental
western Europe. By law, it also underwrites the French film industry,
accounting for 80% of all film financing in that country.</TE>
<TE>   Paradoxically, in view of the current brouhaha, it also has funded its
share of the Hollywood blockbusters deplored by some of the cultural
defenders most incensed by l'affaire Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   Along with hundreds of French movies, Canal Plus has financed such
high-profile Hollywood films as "Basic Instinct," "JFK" and "Terminator
2: Judgment Day."</TE>
<TE>   But the emphasis in this cultural skirmish is on Canal Plus' other
endeavors.</TE>
<TE>   It is known for financing films and promoting new cinematic talents.
It has had recent success with home-grown French blockbusters "Amelie"
and "Brotherhood of the Wolf." It is the home of cultural fixtures such
as "Les Guignols," the program dedicated to political satire, and even
owns the popular Paris St. Germain soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   To Americans, the sight of employees marching on the headquarters of
Vivendi a block from the Arc de Triomphe and unfurling banners that read
"Messier you have had it. Canal+ is in the streets" might seem baffling.
Why such outrage over the firing of a TV executive?</TE>
<TE>   But in France, Lescure's ouster could best be compared to a network
firing a beloved figure like former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite in
the U.S., Borman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if CBS [in Cronkite's heyday] would have decided to just
cancel Cronkite's evening news," explained Borman, who is German. "In
that time and date, I think the American public would have reacted much
more violently than it would today."</TE>
<TE>   Borman noted that within Europe, the French are the most active
supporters of native film industries. Not only do they produce more
home-grown movies a year than any other European country, averaging more
than 100 annually, but their audience is also wide enough to support the
industry--a rare feat when Hollywood movies tend to monopolize world
screens. (In 2000, 46% of Hollywood studios' revenues came from
international box office sales.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is a battle where they are protecting themselves against the
influence and onslaught of American film and culture," said Cedomir
Kolar, a French citizen who produced this year's Oscar-winning foreign
language film "No Man's Land."</TE>
<TE>   American director David Lynch, who is heading the jury at the upcoming
Cannes Film Festival, sided with his French colleagues when he called
Lescure's exit "terrible" not only for Lescure and Canal Plus but also
for diversity in film and television.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Vivendi Universal was a perfect business with, on one side,
a Hollywood studio producing big budget films for the United States and
overseas, and on the other side, Canal Plus, which fought for a different
way of thinking," Lynch told the Paris-based newspaper Le Monde. "Vivendi
Universal had the best of both possible worlds in cinematic production.
Now that's over. We are entering an era of standardization, of
assembly-line cinema. It's the McDonald's Universe."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch was among about 400 well-known personalities who signed a
statement Wednesday in support of Lescure. They included actresses
Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche, director Bertrand Tavernier,
soccer legend Michel Platini and various singers, rappers, athletes and
former Canal Plus executives.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, cultural production is something that cannot be ruled only by
the market," said Laurent Deveze, the cultural attache for the French
Consulate in Los Angeles and a novelist. "When something like this
happens, people are always afraid if the market is going to win the
cultural field totally. That is the reason why the people are out on the
streets."</TE>
<TE>   The focus of French wrath is, for the moment, Messier, whose arrival
on the Hollywood scene instantly gave him mogul status but who then
infuriated the French by moving to New York.</TE>
<TE>   By firing Lescure, while at the same time courting American Barry
Diller, who now runs the American entertainment arm of Vivendi, Messier
has completed his metamorphosis into a villainous marauder, as far as
many French political and cultural leaders are concerned.</TE>
<TE>   As Vivendi's finances suffered in recent months, the media here
grumbled about Messier. In a society that regards unfettered capitalism
and aggressive executives with distrust, he was seen as brash,
acquisitive and ruthlessly obsessed with the bottom line. In short, he
was too "American."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he is right-of-center while French journalists and cultural
leaders tend to be left. A lot of the huffing and puffing expresses
genuine outrage, but there is also a calculated political subtext.</TE>
<TE>   And Canal Plus, while hardly a stranger to the American movie-making
business, is proving to be a provocative national rallying point.</TE>
<TE>   The channel, launched in 1984 as the first pay television service in
France, was similar to America's HBO.</TE>
<TE>   It was considered a revolution in the staid, state-run French
television world of the time. It was at first snubbed because the French
were not accustomed to paying for TV, but through the political
connections of founder Andre Rousselet, Canal Plus got life support from
President Francois Mitterrand, who allowed the channel to show movies a
year before other broadcasters.</TE>
<TE>   This was an important milestone because it ushered in an agreement by
which Canal Plus began to fund both French theater and films.</TE>
<TE>   With French as well as American movies, children's shows, news, talk
shows, documentaries and marquee sports such as soccer, the channel
became a huge cash cow because it was a monopoly pay TV service.</TE>
<TE>   Its irreverent programming and political satire endeared itself to the
young and trendy and quickly established Canal Plus as a cultural icon in
France.</TE>
<TE>   But Canal Plus grew beyond its flagship and began offering nationally
tailored channels in other countries. Its expansion resulted in the
financial losses that played a part in Lescure's dismissal. It reported a
loss of $439 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is the largest pay television provider in Europe, with 15
million subscribers in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, the
Netherlands, Scandinavia and French-speaking Africa. About a third of its
customers reside in France.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being one of the biggest buyers of movies from the
Hollywood studios for its channels, Canal Plus became an important source
of film development funds in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But after losing millions, Canal Plus pulled out of Hollywood for
several years. And recently, its deal to finance the movie company run by
onetime superagent Michael Ovitz unraveled.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal grew out of a headline-grabbing business deal in
December 2000, when Vivendi, a communications and utility giant, acquired
Seagram Co. and its Universal Studios unit, as well as control of Canal
Plus.</TE>
<TE>   It was against this backdrop that Messier moved against Lescure, a
former anchorman and radio personality who collects vintage records and
once dated Deneuve, the actress.</TE>
<TE>   After his ouster, Lescure appeared on Canal Plus in a televised
mutiny. Angry staffers took over the airwaves, applauding in the studio
as Lescure, on the verge of tears, said goodbye. The network then cut to
a weather forecast.</TE>
<TE>   During the "Guignols" show, a puppet who represents anchorman Patrick
Poivre d'Arvor took a shot at Messier in defense of Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   "A month ago, Jean-Marie Messier gave the chief of Canal Plus two
years to overhaul the company," the puppet said. "Two years: that is 24
months, not one month. Pierre, you aren't going to leave the house to
somebody who doesn't even know how to count up to 24."</TE>
<TE>   The puppet then added a defiant "See you tomorrow" to Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   In an editorial, Le Monde accused Messier of endangering a company
that is the top financier of French cinema and, notably, a "great success
in the face of the big American machines."</TE>
<TE>   The presidential candidates also weighed in. Their refrain: The
channel is an almost-sacred French institution.</TE>
<TE>   President Jacques Chirac, whom the "Guignols" puppets portray in a
Superman costume with the name "Super-liar," declared, "What is at stake
today is the richness and diversity of our audiovisual landscape."</TE>

<HD>Israel Out of Nablus, Parts of Ramallah</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The pullback, however, won't end the siege of Arafat.
Officials pledge to aid U.N. probe into the Jenin camp raid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel pulled its forces out of the West Bank city of Nablus and
parts of Ramallah on Saturday night, and officials said they will
cooperate with a United Nations probe into the army's devastating attack
on the Jenin refugee camp.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli moves, however, did not include ending the siege of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah.
They came as President Bush was meeting at Camp David with members of his
national security team, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, to
discuss what peace efforts the U.S. might make next.</LD>
<LD>   Powell, who on Wednesday ended a 10-day overseas trip focused on the
Mideast conflict, failed either to persuade Israel to immediately
withdraw from all Palestinian-controlled areas or to induce Arafat to
declare a cease-fire.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Middle East envoy William Burns toured the wrecked Jenin camp
Saturday as refugees and aid workers continued to search for bodies in
the rubble. He declared it the site of "terrible human tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli officials said they are confident that the United Nations
will determine that no massacre of civilians took place during the
eight-day military offensive, as Palestinians have charged. Hospital
officials in Jenin reported Saturday that 42 bodies had been pulled from
the remains of homes and other buildings bulldozed during the furious
Israeli assault. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers also were killed during
the fighting in the camp, which Israel said it conquered because nearly
two dozen suicide bombers came from its warren of homes.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue efforts continued to be hampered by the presence of explosives
left during the battle. A Palestinian medic who had volunteered his
services suffered severe injuries to a foot Saturday when he stepped on
what local doctors said was a mine. It was unclear whether the device was
left by Israeli or Palestinian fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "He was injured in the camp while helping pull people" from the
rubble, said Dr. Mohammed abu Gali, the director of Jenin's main
hospital. "A mine exploded under his foot."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Gali said another man was lightly injured Saturday when part of
his home collapsed, trapping him. He was freed by rescuers seven hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   Israel withdrew troops and tanks from Jenin and its refugee camp
Friday and Israeli officials said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had made
good on a promise to be out of Nablus and parts of Ramallah by this
morning. When the current intifada began more than a year and a half ago,
Ramallah had long been the commercial and political center of Palestinian
society. Nablus is the largest city in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But the pullouts are limited. Tanks and troops continue to tightly
blockade the West Bank's main cities and are poised to reenter with ease.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions continued to run high in both the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip in the wake of Powell's inconclusive visit.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army reported that a suspected Palestinian suicide bomber
exploded at a checkpoint on the western side of the West Bank town of
Kalkilya on Saturday afternoon, after soldiers there called on him to
halt as he walked through. There was no immediate claim of responsibility
by any group.</TE>
<TE>   And in Gaza, a Palestinian gunman opened fire at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and Gaza, killing a border policeman before being shot
dead by an Israeli tank, both the army and Palestinian sources reported.
The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction, claimed responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Israeli pullbacks appeared to gain momentum, there was no
resolution in sight that would free Arafat from his battered Ramallah
headquarters, or release about 200 gunmen, civilians and others who are
holed up in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has said that Israel will continue to blockade Arafat's
compound until he hands over the men it says carried out the October
assassination of Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis also want Arafat to give them Fuad Shubaki, whom Israel
accuses of bankrolling a large shipment of arms it intercepted en route
to the Gaza Strip this year. All the suspects have been inside Arafat's
besieged compound. The Palestinians have offered to put them on trial
inside Palestinian-controlled territory, an offer Israel has rejected.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the Israelis are demanding the surrender of gunmen who
it says are barricaded inside the 4th century Church of the Nativity,
built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born. The government
has proposed that gunmen who surrender will be allowed to choose whether
to be tried by Israeli military tribunals or sent into permanent exile.
The Palestinians have rejected that offer.</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched the March 29 invasion of West Bank towns and villages
after a string of suicide bombings, and the military offensive has
enjoyed widespread popular support here. But reports of heavy bloodshed
and wanton destruction in the Jenin camp, coupled with images of
devastated Palestinian cities locked down under military curfew, have
exacted a diplomatic price.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Israel decided not to oppose a move in the United Nations
Security Council to send a fact-finding team to determine what happened
in the camp. The resolution, drafted by the United States, passed 15 to
0.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel will cooperate with this team if its aim is to see what
happened," Lt. Col. Yarden Vatikay, spokesman for Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, said in a telephone interview. "The truth is the
best thing that could happen here."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials also welcomed the decision, and Palestinian
Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said he believed it was "the first
step toward making Sharon stand trial before an international tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   After his tour of the Jenin camp's mountains of rubble, Burns, the
assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs, issued a statement
saying that he had gone at Powell's request to see "firsthand the
situation there and to convey the deep concern of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   What happened in the camp, Burns said, "has caused enormous suffering
for thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians. . . . It is critically
important that full and immediate access be ensured for United Nations
relief agencies."</TE>

<DL>JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>It was 4 a.m. April 3 when the first Israeli soldiers crept into
the Jenin refugee camp, the cinder-block houses looming pale and white in
the darkness. Steeled to battle what they had been told was a garrison of
armed terrorists, the soldiers advanced steadily northward through the
camp, a riot of concrete buildings and narrow alleys sprawled over a
gently sloping hillside.</LD>
<LD>   The idea was to push downward, the soldiers recalled later, and drive
Palestinian militants toward a ring of Israeli tanks surrounding the
camp. Lt. Yoni Wolff was leading a squad of snipers when he heard a call
go out from the tall, thin spire of a mosque.</LD>
<LD>   "Here they come! Defend yourselves! Go kill the Jews!" a man screamed
over the same loudspeaker used to call Muslims to prayer.</LD>
<TE>   While Palestinian fighters laid traps and land mines and prepared to
resist, the civilians--and there were many--hid in basements and caves.</TE>
<TE>   So began the deadliest and most disputed episode in Israel's
3-week-long West Bank offensive, an urban battle that left 23 Israeli
soldiers dead--13 in one ambush alone--and scores of Palestinian
civilians killed or wounded when their homes were shelled or bulldozed or
when they were hit by Israeli gunfire. By Saturday, the count of bodies
recovered was two children, four women and 36 men.</TE>
<TE>   For Israelis, Jenin is a breeding ground for suicide bombers--one of
whom, a woman, struck Jerusalem even as the battle raged in the camp. For
Palestinians, Jenin is fast becoming a new rallying cry in their
struggle. On both sides, the camp has emerged as the searing symbol of
the Israeli offensive, the largest military operation in the Palestinian
territories since the lands were captured by Israel in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   And on both sides, a new offensive has begun: the battle for
international opinion and the fight for the moral high ground. The stakes
are high for Israelis and Palestinians alike, as each side fights to
portray itself as a victim and where credibility is strained by
propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   What exactly happened in the Jenin camp has been cloaked in mystery
largely because Israel for days banned the entry of rescue workers,
journalists and other independent eyes. Reporters who circumvented the
restrictions have pieced together the events at the camp through
interviews with dozens of relocated refugees, survivors found in their
homes and the Palestinian fighters and Israeli soldiers who did battle.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with these limitations, the story is necessarily incomplete. The
extent of the destruction in the camp and many details on how the battle
was fought are clear; but it is still not possible to know, among other
things, the way in which some Palestinians died and in what numbers they
died.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Jenin is a story of Israeli reservists, older men with
careers and families and little or no training in urban warfare--the most
dangerous and taxing form of combat--who believed that they were
attacking a terrorist nest already emptied of its civilians. What they
met were fierce resistance and terrified women and children.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came with the ambush of an Israeli platoon. Enraged
and alarmed, the army from that moment on decided to fight a different
way. Foot patrols and house-to-house searches were replaced with
large-scale, unforgiving demolition of any building that might harbor
gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Palestinian claims that a massacre occurred here, there is no
evidence, as yet, supporting the loss of hundreds of lives. The most
egregious allegations--of summary executions, mass graves and hidden
bodies--have not been proved.</TE>
<TE>   And despite Israel's claims that its army takes great care to protect
civilian life, there is evidence of widespread destruction that did claim
civilian lives.</TE>
<TE>Camp a Stronghold for Islamic Radical Groups</TE>
<TE>   The camp, which sits just to the west of the town of Jenin, was
established 49 years ago. It normally squeezes at least 13,000 people
into an area roughly the size of six square city blocks. Buildings abut
each other; tiny, winding alleys connect cramped neighborhoods. Radical
Islamic organizations are especially strong here.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers were told by army intelligence that only about 2,000
people were left when their offensive got off the ground. Most of those
remaining were thought to be hard-core militants who had turned the camp
into an armed fort, and the army still maintains that this was the case.
Palestinian snipers had taken up positions in buildings. Homemade booby
traps lined the streets. Cars were packed with explosives, ready to blow.</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the moment that Lt. Wolff's platoon of reservists from the
army's 5th Brigade neared the first buildings, they began taking fire. As
they scrambled toward safety, a shot rang out from somewhere behind them.
The platoon commander fell, wounded by a bullet to his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff, the second-ranking officer, suddenly found himself in charge of
the assault. He led the 20 or so men into a building and began returning
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Sporadic, back-and-forth shooting lasted the entire day as Wolff and
his men tried to secure the perimeter of the camp for the other squads
slowly entering.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians knew a battle was coming. They heard the explosions
of tank cannons and heavy-caliber machine-gun fire, announcing the
Israelis' arrival. Many fled to the town of Jenin or to surrounding
villages. The civilian men, women and children who stayed behind hoarded
food for a long siege and hid in the relative safety of windowless rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Bahaldin abu Hassen took cover in his basement with his elderly
parents, his brothers, their wives and 10 children. Theirs was one of the
first houses to be taken over by the troops. They heard the footsteps of
the soldiers, who quickly found and confronted the family.</TE>
<TE>   "Wain shabab?" "Where are the 'boys'?" one of the soldiers demanded,
speaking in accented Arabic and referring to the fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know," Abu Hassen insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the soldiers took up positions in Abu Hassen's two-story
house, while others moved on. About a block away, they came to the home
of Afaf Dusuky. She was in her mid-50s, a spinster who moved slowly.</TE>
<TE>   When there was no reply at her door, Israeli soldiers blasted a
basketball-sized hole into Dusuky's metal front door, common procedure
when someone fails to open up to military search.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was recovered 10 days later, pierced with shrapnel, lying
just inside the door on the concrete floor.</TE>
<TE>   The Jenin camp was of special importance to the Israelis. Half of the
110 suicide bombers since the Palestinian uprising began in September
2000 had come from Jenin, or at least received training there, according
to the military.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of the invasion, Wolff said, he and his men didn't
encounter civilians.</TE>
<TE>   But on the second day, about 5 a.m., Wolff saw a man on his belly,
crawling toward them. An enemy or civilian? He couldn't be sure in a
conflict where the enemy doesn't always wear a uniform. Nor could he take
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is supposed to be outside," Wolff later recalled. "We saw a
Palestinian man who is the perfect age to be a warrior crawling out of
his house. You automatically suspect him. We had to shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   For the next seven days, the army made slow, painful progress down the
hill toward the center of the refugee camp. They weaved their way down
through two neighborhoods, Al Damaj and Al Hawashin, going house to
house, door to door.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army blared announcements twice a day in Arabic, promising
safe passage to those who came out of hiding, along with offers of food
and medical care.</TE>
<TE>   The descent down the hill wasn't easy. The army advanced only a few
hundred yards some days. Snipers picked at them from behind walls and
through windows. The soldiers found wires stretched across streets, ready
to trigger homemade pipe and gas-cylinder bombs.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, military officials said, soldiers arrested a 6-year-old
boy ferrying three pipe bombs from one building to another.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian loudspeakers blared propaganda in Hebrew as the soldiers
nervously made their way down the hill.</TE>
<TE>   "Be careful--it's going to be a graveyard. We have plenty of surprises
for you," one voice called.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the military called in helicopter rocket strikes on
specific windows and doorways. Most targets were selected by soldiers in
the field who said they could see where the shooting was coming from.</TE>
<TE>   On the fourth day of the invasion, Saturday, April 6, Ali Damaj,
director of emergency services for the camp, looked out his kitchen
window to see an 18-foot-tall armored bulldozer plowing toward his
neighbors' homes--and then his. In the space of minutes, the bulldozer
chopped and churned and knocked six houses to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's get the hell out of here!" Damaj cried to his wife and children
as the gargantuan machine came closer.</TE>
<TE>   Abruptly, the bulldozer ground to a halt and retreated. Then a platoon
of soldiers combed through, shooting as it went, Damaj said.</TE>
<TE>   Damaj's mentally disabled neighbor, Hassan abu Hattab, a father of
three, refused to leave his home before it was bulldozed. Neighbors found
his body with one bullet wound to his head, nine to his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Damaj and his family took refuge with about 30 other people who
crowded into one neighborhood house that had escaped pummeling. For most
of the siege, they hid in one room, sharing water and bread, and every
night tried to keep count of the explosions they heard from helicopters
firing rockets. Damaj said that on the worst night, he thinks that he
counted two a minute.</TE>
<TE>   Damaj was determined not to flee, as many residents had done.</TE>
<TE>   In his mind was the image of his parents, desperately escaping their
home near what is now the Israeli city of Haifa in 1948, when Israel
declared statehood and fought its war of independence. Furthermore, he
reasoned, abandoning the camp would only make it easier for the Israelis
to enter and kill the fighters.</TE>
<TE>   As the soldiers approached the center of the camp, the landscape
changed. Buildings stood even closer together. The streets grew narrower.
Alleys snaked between two- and three-story homes.</TE>
<TE>   There, the Palestinian fighters decided to make a final stand. They
filled buildings around a small central plaza and waited.</TE>
<TE>   "We were strong-willed," fighter Gasan Haija recalled later as he
recovered in a hospital from bullet wounds to the leg. "We all swore to
die as martyrs."</TE>
<TE>Gunfire Near Plaza on the Seventh Day</TE>
<TE>   On the seventh day of the operation, Tuesday, April 9, Maj. Oded
Golomb led a squad of reservists toward the central plaza. He turned up a
narrow alleyway just before the plaza, entering a small courtyard
surrounded by high buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Gunfire erupted from every direction. Pipe bombs sailed through the
air. The squad was trapped by relentless cross-fire. At some point, a
suicide bomber detonated himself in the tight space.</TE>
<TE>   Golomb was killed. Several of his men were dead or injured.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of wounded soldiers. We are trapped here. Please send
more soldiers," the squad's radio operator pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   An evacuation team headed by Capt. Yakov Azulai ran to free the men,
but Azulai was shot and killed as he entered the alley. One of the medics
was hit as he tried to reach the wounded men.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, one platoon managed to fight its way into the building from
which most of the fire emanated, killing all those inside.</TE>
<TE>   The battle in the courtyard had taken two hours. The Palestinians had
wiped out almost an entire platoon from the 5th Brigade, killing 13 and
wounding six. It was the worst death toll since a September 1997 clash
with Islamic guerrillas of the Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon,
which left 13 commandos dead.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Israelis read it, the ambush in the plaza proved that the
Palestinians were holed up in the surrounding homes and could be
extracted only with great loss of life. From that moment on, the
bulldozers would crush any home believed to be a source of enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a turning point for us to understand that if we didn't use a
different kind of force, this place was going to be a graveyard for us,"
Lt. Kobi Benshabat recalled.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, several of the soldiers held a memorial service for a
company commander killed seven days earlier. But clearly they were
thinking of their comrades. Rami Meir, 41, a reservist who was also
observant, opened his prayer book to lead the men but choked on his tears
in the middle of the kaddish, a mourning lament.</TE>
<TE>   He looked out of the corner of his eye and saw half the company
weeping. "Someone else had to finish the prayer," he later told a Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers had occupied Hania Kabia's house, overlooking the plaza,
two days before the ambush. On the day it happened, she watched the
soldiers crying in her living room. And then they brought out maps and
aerial photography that showed every building, every yard in the cramped
camp. Building after building was outlined with a marking pen.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Israelis began leveling the homes. In many cases, families
inside ran out, hands raised, as the concrete blocks turned to chunky
dust. And some people didn't make it out.</TE>
<TE>   "After those soldiers were killed, they started bulldozing like
crazy," Kabia said later. Her place was spared because the soldiers used
it as a post. Later, when the soldiers left, one of them left behind
graffiti by a windowsill in Kabia's living room. In Hebrew, it said, "I
don't have another land."</TE>
<TE>   Kabia and other Palestinians said that after the ambush, the Israelis
stopped giving warning to occupants of homes about to be crushed. The
Israelis say they did continue to give warning; besides, one officer
said, it takes at least 20 minutes to demolish a building, allowing
plenty of time to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Rina Zayyed, 15, sitting at home with her father and brother, was one
of those hit by Israeli fire. An Israeli gunship began firing on a man in
the street below who was recharging a cell phone with his car battery.
Two fragments of the shell broke through the family's living room window.
One hit Rina in the chest. The man in the street, identified as Ameed Ali
Amouny, 20, was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were afraid that the Israelis would fire on an
ambulance--which the army says is sometimes used as cover for fighters
and weapons--Rina's relatives decided that the safest way to get her to
the hospital was for her to play dead. They covered her with a sheet,
removed a door from its hinges to use as a stretcher and carried her
through the streets in a feigned funeral procession, saying, "Allah is
great!"</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the resistance began to collapse. On Wednesday, April 10,
Mahmoud Tawalbeh, 23, a commander in the military wing of the radical
group Islamic Jihad and purported mastermind of several suicide bombings,
turned up dead.</TE>
<TE>   The bulldozers fell silent, and the relentless helicopter fire ceased.
The Israelis had won the battle of the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there was no plaza left to behold.</TE>
<TE>Vast Part of Camp Reduced to Wasteland</TE>
<TE>   A vast portion of the heart of the Jenin camp had become a wasteland,
a lunar landscape bereft of recognizable structures. Shards of concrete
were piled 6 feet deep, burying body parts, clothing, children's toys,
prayer mats, all in a tangled mass. The carcasses of buildings loomed
precariously on the edge of the wasteland, which reeked of death.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians estimate that 200 buildings were destroyed. The United
Nations estimates that more than 2,000 refugees are homeless. It is not
known how many bodies are rotting in the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the Jenin battle, Jamal Hwei had run out of
ammunition. He was ensconced in a building near the plaza with 28 other
fighters, and things looked bleak.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't supposed to be like this. In some ways, Hwei had once
embodied what a future Palestine was to be. Raised in the refugee camp,
he didn't participate in the first intifada against Israeli rule, from
1987 to 1993, and instead went to Jordan to study. He returned to the
West Bank in 1993 with an economics degree and set about working in the
Palestinian Legislative Council, a governing body meant to herald the
coming of a functioning state.</TE>
<TE>   When the current conflict erupted in September 2000, Hwei took up a
gun. He continued as a militant in the Fatah movement of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat. It isn't clear whether Hwei formally
belonged to the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the most active Fatah militia
and the one responsible for many of the suicide bombings. But he had
crossed over to the realm of armed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, April 11, convinced that he and the men with him were
about to be killed, Hwei decided to surrender. To arrange the deal, he
used his cell phone to call an Israeli human rights organization,
B'Tselem, which helped negotiate his surrender. All 29 men were taken
away by the Israelis, destined to join a total of 500 captured during the
operation. The Israeli army says several top Islamic Jihad and Fatah
militants are among those captured.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't to be the fate of Yusuf Kabaha, better known as Abu
Jendal. A veteran activist with the Palestine Liberation Organization who
cut his teeth in Lebanon, Tunisia and other points of exile, Abu Jendal
was a police commander who headed security for the Jenin camp. He appears
to have been one of the main leaders of resistance to the Israeli
invasion.</TE>
<TE>   By popular account, he was captured on the last day of the battle,
executed and left on a pile of dirt in the center of the camp for all to
see, the marks visible on his wrists where the handcuffs had been. This
incident cannot be verified, but Palestinians believe it universally. And
the Israelis, who will not comment on a specific death, deny executing
anybody.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Before they met Nancy Mellor, their world was the long flat fields
of the Central Valley, their backs hunched in the heat picking cotton and
tomatoes, the hazy slope of mountains in the distance holding back the
outside world.</LD>
<LD>   At school, the children of farm workers were not expected to enroll in
advanced classes or go to college.</LD>
<LD>   That was before the strange, scary math teacher from Pennsylvania
showed up.</LD>
<TE>   She recruited the farm workers' children for her advanced math
classes, coached them and tutored them in sessions after school and at
her home. She issued impossible instructions:</TE>
<TE>   You will stop working in the fields for the summer. You will attend a
six-week program for gifted youths at UC Berkeley, and you will study
harder than you ever thought possible.</TE>
<TE>   To raise the money to go there, you will persuade strangers to buy
tickets betting on where a cow will relieve itself.</TE>
<TE>   You will take the SAT. You will apply to colleges, and write and
rewrite and rewrite again your personal statements until I am satisfied
with them. You will win scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   She badgered the Berkeley summer program into accepting her students
and subsidizing them; she wheedled colleges into looking past the
students sometimes lackluster test scores to the gifts and grit
underneath.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, almost all of the children of farm workers who
came under Mrs. Mellor's wing would attend college, nearly 100 of them.
Gilbert Mireles is at Yale. Eduardo Gonzalez went to Brown. Others went
to Harvard, MIT, Stanford. They have become city councilmen and school
board members, bankers, engineers and teachers. Some of them have
returned to transform their hometowns.</TE>
<TE>   It was almost inevitable that Nancy Mellor would make waves when she
moved to Coalinga 17 years ago. A Pennsylvania Quaker, she had come to
the Central Valley to follow her husband to his new job at a community
college. Her background was in the civil rights and feminist movements.
She came with a love of city culture--music and plays--and, as the mother
of two college students, she held strong opinions about the importance of
education.</TE>
<TE>   Then 46, she found herself in an isolated world of tiny, dusty towns,
vast fields and clearly marked boundaries between whites and Latinos. A
place without so much as a movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   Coalinga was a town of mostly working-class white people, where the
modest ranch houses were set out in rows almost as tidy as the
surrounding crops and where many made their living in the nearby oil
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Huron, 18 miles away, is a town of farm workers, mostly Mexican
immigrants. Many live crowded into trailers and crumbling apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The two towns have long shared a school system, with Huron students
bumping over country roads on a bus to Coalinga.</TE>
<TE>   In school, the gulf between the two towns and two ethnic groups was
stark, Mrs. Mellor learned.</TE>
<TE>   The new teacher walked into sunny Room 10 at Coalinga Middle School to
convene her advanced math class and blinked in surprise. On a campus that
was then 51% Latino, almost all the faces gazing back at her were white.</TE>
<TE>   She asked administrators for an explanation. Their answer, she said:
Latino students did not speak English well enough to take higher-level
math classes.</TE>
<TE>   Her students say such attitudes were common. Gilbert Mireles, now a
PhD candidate at Yale, recalls being told that he would not be allowed to
enroll in the ninth-grade honors English class. A straight-A student, he
asked why not. The answer: That class was for the college-bound only.</TE>
<TE>   "The established social order is just so valued to people in that
community," Mireles said. "As a Mexican, you're supposed to be humble."</TE>
<TE>   Mellor refused to accept the situation. She plucked promising Latino
children from her other classes and installed them with the other
advanced students.</TE>
<TE>   The anointed students were terrified. The middle-aged teacher with the
flyaway hair and caged rat named Pepito allowed no lags in attention
during class and piled on the homework. After reading that students test
better if they are slightly uncomfortable physically, she threw open the
classroom windows one winter morning before handing out exams. But the
students were entranced by her talk about how the world would open up for
them if they were willing to work hard.</TE>
<TE>   Many of their mothers and fathers were delighted too. Mireles' father,
Gilbert Sr., had made a habit of calling schools of education to solicit
advice on how to help his children succeed. In Mellor, parents saw an
ally close to home.</TE>
<TE>   The children started coming into Mellor's classroom after school to
tackle their homework together, and stayed to chat about whatever was in
their heads. Room 10 became their hangout. From advanced math, they moved
onto the academic pentathlon team that Mrs. Mellor coached. Suddenly,
they were seen as serious students; they saw themselves the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, many students were spending time at Mrs. Mellor's house
and calling her "Mama Mellor."</TE>
<TE>   And then came her inspiration, one that would transform the lives of
hundreds of her students.</TE>
<TE>   He took a front-row seat in her class: skinny Ricardo Gonzalez, with
his slight Mexican accent, his big eyes and his endless questions about
college and life outside Huron.</TE>
<TE>'Someone Who Believed in Me'</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mexico, Ricardo came to the Central Valley with his parents
when he was 6. Even as a child, he worked summers in the fields, picking
as much cantaloupe as his arms could carry.</TE>
<TE>   He was determined not to spend his life picking crops, aware that his
father had moved from Mexico mainly for his children's education.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo spent hours after school talking to Mrs. Mellor. And with her
own children a continent away in Eastern colleges, he took a place in her
heart. "After hearing so much that you're not going to be anything, I was
looking to find someone who believed in me," Ricardo said.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Mellor remembered a summer program at UC Berkeley that accepted
gifted middle school and high school students to take college classes.
She had Ricardo apply. He was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Mrs. Mellor buttonholed Berkeley officials at a
conference. You say you want talented minority students; well, I've got
one for you. Who cares if his test scores are low? He has talents those
tests can't measure.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1986, armed with a backpack and some emergency
numbers, off went 14-year-old Ricardo to stay with Quaker friends of
Mellor's in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a complete disaster," Mellor cheerfully recalls. The only
Latino boy in a program full of mostly middle-class white kids from the
Bay Area, Ricardo sank into lonely isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was miserable," he said. "It was tough material, and there was no
one to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   But Ricardo went back for five consecutive summers.</TE>
<TE>   During the school years, Mrs. Mellor paid him--sometimes out of her
own pocket--to grade papers for her middle school math classes. The
teacher packed him and a bunch of others into a van one Saturday and
drove them to Stanford University so they could see the campus. The
morning after his senior prom, he went to Mrs. Mellor's house with his
friends. She made waffles.</TE>
<TE>   He finished high school and returned to UC Berkeley for college,
helping to found the university's first Mexican American residence hall.</TE>
<TE>   After college, Ricardo became a teacher--of math, as it happens. After
two years in the schools, he turned to the business world; now 30, he
runs his own computer business from a home office in Hanford, not far
from Coalinga and Huron.</TE>
<TE>   Such a future seemed unimaginable at the end of that first disastrous
summer in Berkeley. Teacher and pupil talked and talked about what had
gone wrong, what could make it better.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her that it would have been perfect if I had some company,
someone going through the same thing with me," Ricardo said.</TE>
<TE>'Disaster' Inspires Redoubled Effort</TE>
<TE>   Mellor was inspired all over again. Rather than back off from the
Berkeley program, she would send more students, dozens of them. She would
spend her summers with them, egging them on. Their families would come up
on weekends to ease the homesickness and remind the children what they
were working to attain.</TE>
<TE>   She learned that Berkeley officials wanted to bring more minority
students into the summer program.</TE>
<TE>   Mellor told them: I've got the students. All you have to do is change
your criteria so you're no longer relying on the SAT, and give them
financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley officials were game. "We were going to change the criteria
anyway," said Nina Gabelko, director of Berkeley's Academic Talent
Development Program. "But she was very insistent about it. She came in
punching."</TE>
<TE>   Mellor decided to include students of all ethnic groups from Coalinga
and Huron. She hoped to start breaking down barriers, and she believed
that the white students also needed more demanding classroom work and a
bigger perspective on school and life.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1987, Coalinga-Huron House was born, an organization
to help students get into the Berkeley program and pay for their stay. It
was also the name of their rented digs in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo's parents sat on the first board.</TE>
<TE>   During the school year, Mrs. Mellor's proteges had to do all their
homework, all the time. They had to fill out the intimidating Berkeley
application. And they had to help bring in the cash for summer room and
board, using Mrs. Mellor's moneymaking ideas.</TE>
<TE>   They ran through public parks plucking wisteria pods that they sold to
a dried flower distributor in Oregon. They sold candy, tamales and
cinnamon rolls. They staged the Cow Pie Drop, a rustic form of bingo
still held every May.</TE>
<TE>   Near a park in the center of Coalinga, students draw a grid on a
field, marking it off like a giant bingo board. Nearby, a cow munches on
grass. Other students sell bingo boards to townspeople, who bet on where
the just-gorged bovine will make its mark.</TE>
<TE>   That first summer, Mellor managed to get 17 students into the program,
with their costs covered. As June turned to July and the heat pushed down
on the valley, the students made the four-hour drive up Interstate 5 from
their tan, level towns and into the colorful streets of Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in rooms rented from a fraternity house, sharing it with
the frat boys who had remained for the summer and staring in awe at their
posters of scantily clad women. But they lived by very different rules.
No cliques or romantic involvements were permitted. Class and ethnic
lines were temporarily erased. It was as liberating for the white kids as
for the Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "Being young and stuck in our own little stereotypes, it really helped
us break down those barriers," said Richard White, a 1993 Coalinga High
graduate who spent four summers in the program and made lifelong friends
with Latino classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Mellor lived in Berkeley with the students, as unpaid cook, substitute
mother and tutor. They lived on the cheap, with boxes of lettuce and
tomatoes picked by parents. When the prison in Coalinga was selling
poultry for 10 cents a pound from one of its inmate industries, the
students ate chicken for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Mellor forced them to study. But she, too, underwent a change. So
fierce in the Coalinga classroom, she softened and relaxed in the cool
Bay Area fog. She listened as their new perceptions unfolded, listened to
their most secret dreams, and acted as a tour guide into a bigger, richer
world of experience.</TE>
<TE>   They went to museums and cafes and bookstores. Mellor persuaded a
local theater company to donate tickets.</TE>
<TE>   When one teen made a disparaging remark about a homeless person,
Mellor had the whole group serve food at a local soup kitchen. She
brought dignitaries to the grubby fraternity house for visits. Former UC
Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien dropped by one day, planning to stay
for half an hour and hanging out for 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   The number of students grew each summer, topping out at 50. In all,
200 have gone through the Berkeley program, nearly half of them children
of farm workers. It showed them that if they were willing to put in six
or more hours of study a day, they could hold their own against the
brightest students in California, urbane teenagers raised with every
possible privilege.</TE>
<TE>   It bolstered their transcripts with college credits from one of the
nation's best public universities.</TE>
<TE>   But more than anything, the students say, those summers awoke a hunger
for all the things their muted agrarian world at home lacked.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go back to Coalinga, you feel like you're worth something,"
said Gilbert Mireles, who became the first in his family to go to
college--at Swarthmore.</TE>
<TE>   Now 26, he has almost completed his doctorate in sociology. His area
of research is migrant farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   His younger brother and sister also went through Mellor's program and
then to Swarthmore on scholarships. Isaac works at an investment bank in
Philadelphia. Laurie is a senior.</TE>
<TE>   An older sister who did not go through Mellor's program dropped out of
high school in the 11th grade.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it took more than the summer Berkeley program for
Coalinga-Huron students to gain admission to top colleges. Sometimes, it
took nothing less than Mellor's indomitable will.</TE>
<TE>   She pushed the students to take college entrance tests. She coaxed
them to write draft after draft of their personal statements. She slaved
over her own letters of recommendation. And then, when the carefully
typed forms had been checked and rechecked and mailed in crisp envelopes,
she got on the phone to the colleges or visited admissions offices during
what was left of her summer vacations. In 1994, she became the guidance
counselor at Coalinga High.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Chermonte, dean of admissions and financial aid at Oberlin
College in Ohio, said Mellor was something of a legend in her office.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of Mellor's students attended Oberlin. Many of them had much
lower SAT scores than the average Oberlin student, Chermonte said, and
probably would not have been admitted without Mellor's passionate
recommendations and lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very inspiring to the admissions committee," Chermonte said.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons went on even after the acceptance letters came in. Gilbert
remembers Mellor sitting him and a friend down to dinner at her house,
teaching them to use a knife and fork properly, what to do with multiple
spoons and how to pass plates.</TE>
<TE>   For children who consumed almost every meal using tortillas as a
utensil, it was a valuable starter lesson in facing the intimidating
world of prestige colleges.</TE>
<TE>'Mrs. Him' Finds Her Calling</TE>
<TE>   Mellor says she has more in common with her students than they know.
She was the child of Swedish immigrants and grew up in rural Michigan
before going off in 1955 to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.
Surrounded by sophisticated young women from well-off families, she felt
sorely out of place.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation in 1959, she married and taught for one year, then
quit to rear two children. She said she never thought she would do
anything else with her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I was Mrs. Him," she said. "I didn't have anything to say for a long
time in my life. I think I was a slow developer."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, a history teacher and college administrator, appears
lovingly perplexed by the transformation in his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first got married, she wasn't like this," said Reed T.
Mellor. "She was more a typical woman of the 1950s."</TE>
<TE>   But about the time her youngest daughter, Kate, now 35, went off to
first grade, Mellor began to think about going back to work.</TE>
<TE>   The women's movement and the civil rights movement transfixed her,
made her yearn to do something with her life. Besides, she said, "I'm
bossy. I'd run my kids' lives if I was at home. I had to find some other
outlet for my energy."</TE>
<TE>   She began teaching again, taking night classes to get her credential.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hooked," she said. "And of course what hooked me were the
underdog kids."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Reed Mellor came home and said he had a job offer in
California as an administrator at West Hills College.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived in Coalinga that summer, a rough time for the area. A 6.7
earthquake had nearly leveled the downtown the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, the Mellors noticed the fault lines separating
whites and Latinos, and the low expectations for all students.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just simply doing what needed to be done," she said. "My
conscience said do it, so I did it. . . . Everyone else would have done
it too if they had thought about it a little longer."</TE>
<TE>   Many in town, even some who were wary of the program and Mellor's
methods, say they grew to admire her work. "A lot of people said, 'You
can't do that with those kids.' And she said, 'I'll prove it to you,' "
said Roger Campbell, principal of Coalinga High School for the last
decade. "It opened my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Mellor cared little about warnings from some teachers and parents that
she was asking too much of her students, or that Berkeley was not the
proper place for children to spend their summers.</TE>
<TE>   She also turned a deaf ear to her family's complaints about her long
absences.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, we were put out," her husband said. "Particularly in the
summer. She was just gone, solid, completely away from me for six-plus
weeks. And even though I'd come up and visit her, I couldn't even spend
time with her, because she was so busy."</TE>
<TE>   The only thing Nancy Mellor took to heart was the successes or
failures of her students.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a terrible blow when, in the early 1990s, her relationship
with Ricardo Gonzalez--her first protege, the inspiration for her entire
program--was torn apart in hurt and bitterness. Both say they don't
recall the specifics of the quarrel that separated them. But Ricardo, now
30, said he felt that Mellor was trying to control his life, even his
social life. The rift has not healed.</TE>
<TE>   "She tried to be my mom and get too much into my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mellor was despondent. She began to reevaluate her relationships with
all her students. Was she trying to be a parent instead of a teacher?
Should she stop playing such a huge role in their lives?</TE>
<TE>   No, she could not do that.</TE>
<TE>   She would simply have to accept that children grow up and leave their
teachers behind.</TE>
<TE>   "All teachers with passion have a problem knowing how much to love,"
she said. "Sometimes, you love too much . . . and there is a time when
they don't need the love any more."</TE>
<TE>   She sighed a few times and took a deep breath. "It took me awhile to
realize that, that you just let them go."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Mellor began to yearn for a higher post. If she had
been able to accomplish this much as a counselor and teacher, just think
what she could do as a principal. But she says she was turned down for
promotions in Coalinga and Huron. In 1997, she left the district to
become assistant principal of a high school in nearby Avenal, where 94%
of the 2,400 students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>Earned Doctorate in Education</TE>
<TE>   She has shot up the ranks there, from assistant principal to principal
to assistant superintendent in charge of curriculum. She also earned a
doctorate in education from the University of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her earliest students have returned to Coalinga to continue in
her path.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Walker, a white student who went to Stanford University, is back
in the classroom at Coalinga Middle School. His father, an art teacher at
the high school, said he always figured his son would get a Cal State
education, until Mellor convinced him to think bigger.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from UC Santa Barbara, Richard White also returned to
Coalinga to teach. Now 26, he works for the College Board in the Bay
Area. His area of interest: improving minority access to higher
education.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Gonzalez, Ricardo's younger brother, took a job working with
an education nonprofit in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he won a seat on the Coalinga-Huron school board. His
mission: Get the schools to do a better job of helping farm workers'
children. His brother Javier, who went to Yale, teaches elementary school
in the valley and serves on the Huron City Council.</TE>
<TE>   But the last few years have been rocky for Mellor's amazing college
entrance machine. Coalinga High School students no longer have her to
bully and cajole them through the application process. Acceptances to
elite colleges have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the first summer after Mellor left the Coalinga-Huron school
district, her summer program didn't happen. The next year, she brought it
back to life and added students from Avenal--but no longer lived in
Berkeley as director.</TE>
<TE>   The replacements she hired haven't quite worked out--she's had a new
one every summer.</TE>
<TE>   "She's nuts," said Gabelko, the administrator at Berkeley. "Why can't
we find another nut?"</TE>
<TE>   But the program seemed to work its magic even without her there.</TE>
<TE>   Mellor, now 64, takes inspiration from a 14-year-old boy from Avenal
who enrolled in a basic writing course at Berkeley. Night after night, he
reworked drafts of simple five-paragraph essays. Week after week, his
instructor handed back the papers with big red Ds and Fs. Even when it
became clear he would not pass the class, he kept his temper in check,
kept checking his spelling and hammering out his topic sentences. On the
night his last essay was due, he stayed up past midnight going over his
grammar.</TE>
<TE>   He ended up the victorious author of one glorious paper with an A at
the top.</TE>
<TE>   For students like these, Mellor said, she recently decided to return
to Berkeley part-time this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "They all go somewhere," Mellor said of her students. The day is
ending and children trickle off campus at an Avenal middle school, their
clothes and backpacks bursts of color against the brown landscape and
washed-out sky. Just beyond the parking lot, the fields stretch to the
hills. "And there are so many more like them."</TE>

<HD>A Sometime Champion of Democracy</HD>
<DH>Government: The Bush administration's initial acceptance of
Venezuela's coup erodes the United States' moral authority.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's rapid initial approval of this month's
coup in Venezuela has tarnished its status as self-proclaimed champion of
democracy and the rule of law in Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, the reaction to the attempted ouster of President Hugo
Chavez especially rankled Latin leaders because it followed recent trade
and security measures in which the U.S. has been seen as contradicting
its principles.</LD>
<LD>   The practical effects could include an erosion in support for U.S.
policies on Iraq and the Middle East conflict, Latin American diplomats
say.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, there is little sympathy in the region for Chavez, who has
trampled on a few democratic principles himself. But by seemingly backing
the overthrow of a freely elected leader, the United States has
diminished its capacity for moral suasion.</TE>
<TE>   "There is at least a short-term cost. It's not something people will
forget," said Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, a political scientist and
director of the Mexico City-based Center for Economic Research and
Teaching. "It's a displacement of the very ends that the United States is
trying to promote."</TE>
<TE>   After Chavez was replaced April 12, White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer declared the Bush administration's support for new elections.
And National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on a television news
show two days later that Chavez's policies were not working for his
country. But the administration has insisted that it took no action to
encourage a coup or ensure its success.</TE>
<TE>Response Draws Fire</TE>
<TE>   For all the administration's talk of backing democracies and free
markets, its response gave the impression that the U.S. government
selectively supports coups d'etat and a short-circuiting of the popular
will, various observers in the hemisphere say.</TE>
<TE>   A leading Brazilian newspaper, O Globo, said, "Washington's
impatience, its supposed approval of the coup leaders and its hurry to
approve an interim government bring back memories of a past that
democracies of the continent repudiate with fervor."</TE>
<TE>   Most Latin American leaders--led by the presidents of Mexico, Brazil
and Argentina--were quick to condemn the coup attempt. Upon his return to
office, Chavez singled out Mexico's Vicente Fox by thanking him for
refusing to recognize the coup leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian government reacted "with pleasure to Venezuela's return
to constitutional order and its democratic process. . . . It marks an
important achievement in the reaffirmation of Latin American values and
democratic principles."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile is under fire at home
for his seemingly ambivalent initial response to the news. Lagos' fellow
leftists say Chilean leaders have a special responsibility to denounce
coup attempts, given the violent 1973 overthrow of President Salvador
Allende.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the U.S. reaction that had immediate repercussions at the
United Nations, with Latin American diplomats holding a private conclave
and the large developing-nation bloc uniting quickly behind Chavez and,
by implicit extension, against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus, participants said, was that the coup plotters had acted
only because they believed--rightly or not--that they had been given a
green light by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States blew it badly," said a senior Latin American
diplomat at the U.N. from a country that is normally supportive of
Washington. "It is now trying to get out of this situation the best that
it can. But damage has definitely been done."</TE>
<TE>U.S. Actions a Concern</TE>
<TE>   The Venezuelan fiasco occurred amid lingering bitterness in the region
after the U.S. slapped tariffs of up to 30% on foreign steel this year.
That measure in effect seals off the U.S. market from exporters such as
Brazil, which says the tariff runs counter to free trade principles.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement agencies' roundup of hundreds of foreigners after
Sept. 11 and the secrecy surrounding their detention also concern many
Latin Americans for what the actions convey about legal institutions that
heretofore were regarded as exemplary.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the measures have been more appropriate to a dictatorship,
and so I hope they are only temporary," said Diego Valades, director of
the Center for Juridical Studies at Mexico's National Autonomous
University.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, Fox is under fire for forging stronger U.S. links. It
doesn't help that his quest for legal status for about 3 million
undocumented immigrants in the United States is stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, there is exasperation in Argentina over U.S. reluctance to
approve a financial assistance package to help the Latin nation out of
its economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to mend diplomatic fences after a difficult week in the region
for the United States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell assured the
representatives of the Organization of American States at a meeting
Thursday in Washington that the administration stands with critics of the
failed coup.</TE>
<TE>   That effort was undercut, however, by U.S. efforts to water down the
initial OAS resolution to repudiate Chavez's attempted ouster.</TE>
<TE>   "We condemn the blows to constitutional order that Venezuela has
suffered," Powell told the gathering. "We look to the legal authorities
of Venezuela to hold accountable all who violated the law both before and
during the recent crisis."</TE>
<TE>   In a reference to the shaky history of democratic regimes in Latin
America, Powell said: "Coups are a thing of the past, not a pathway to
the future."</TE>
<TE>   He also acknowledged that the coup raised the question of how
vigorously other countries, including the United States, had acted in
support of Venezuelan democracy. And he said words that Latin leaders
wanted to hear--that democratic processes must be observed.</TE>
<TE>   "We must do this not just for Venezuela's sake but for all our sakes,"
he said, "because the consolidation of democracy in our hemisphere is
profoundly important to all of us--to our freedom, to our prosperity and
to our security."</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. analysts say the administration's handling of the coup
attempt was a diplomatic setback but will probably not have lasting
effects on its influence in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But others say it raised questions about the competence of the Bush
team dealing with Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said the episode showed that
the administration needs more "adult supervision."</TE>

<HD>French Voters Flirt With the Fringes</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bored with top contenders Chirac and Jospin, 60% look to
alternatives in today's presidential election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>As the front-runners stumbled toward France's presidential election
today, a dissatisfied electorate turned much of its attention to a cast
of protest candidates who don't seem to have a prayer of winning.</LD>
<LD>   It is still likely that President Jacques Chirac and his main
challenger, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, will emerge from the first
round and compete in a runoff May 5. The voters sense that, according to
polls, and slightly favor Chirac in an eventual second-round contest with
Jospin.</LD>
<LD>   But only about 40% of the voters plan to cast first-round ballots for
either of the two veteran politicians. The public's familiarity with the
suave Chirac, 69, and the solemn Jospin, 64, has bred boredom--if not
contempt. Their anticipated share of the vote has declined in recent
days.</LD>
<TE>   And the fringe candidates are coming on strong. Unhappy with
traditional leaders, the French are casting about for alternatives among
a record 16 aspirants. But the politics of the outsiders tends toward the
extremist, quixotic and downright outdated, suggesting that their appeal
is largely symbolic and that this society remains profoundly resistant to
change.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no candidate who truly incarnates change," said Pierre
Giacometti of Ipsos, a top polling company here. "The voters are bored.
Their relationship with politics is distant, especially the young. And
the French are still very attached to the idea of the state, of public
benefits, state-run companies. There's a real distrust of globalization
and economic liberalism."</TE>
<TE>   Although leaders pushing privatization and globalization have remade
the political landscape in Britain, Spain and other European countries,
France has no major candidate in the classic free-market mode. Chirac is
considered right of center, but he's no cheerleader for globalization--he
and the center-left Jospin joined forces as stolid holdouts at a European
Union summit last month when every other country wanted to open the
region's energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin and Chirac have spent the last five years as uneasy partners,
with Chirac as head of state and Jospin's Socialists running the
government. Voters complain that this arrangement, known as
"cohabitation," stifles progress and blurs already limited differences
between the two platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for an edge, Chirac plays up his credentials as a confident
representative of France on the world stage. He calls Jospin ineffectual
in the face of an alarming rise in crime--probably the decisive issue in
the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Aware that the French find Chirac charming and "presidential" but less
than trustworthy, Jospin emphasizes his reputation for integrity and
takes credit for a decline in unemployment from 12% to 9% since he took
office in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the first round has shaped up as an opportunity for
voters to make a statement. They have quite a roster of ideologies and
personalities from which to choose a messenger.</TE>
<TE>   There's the grizzled Jean-Marie Le Pen of the far-right National
Front, a former paratrooper who garnered 15% of the vote for president in
1995. Le Pen, 73, blames crime on immigrants and wants to yank France out
of the EU. Toning down his famously aggressive rhetoric and denying the
frequent accusation that he is a bigot, Le Pen has surged in the polls,
reaching about 14% compared with 18% for Jospin and 22% for Chirac,
according to the most recent Ipsos survey.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen's chances of squeaking into the second round are slim. But it's
hard to predict what his followers and other protest voters will do in an
eventual runoff, Giacometti said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that another maverick, perennial Trotskyite contender Arlette
Laguiller, registers about 10% of the intended vote doesn't mean that
one-tenth of the electorate dreams of a proletarian revolution or can
even be counted as a sure left-wing vote.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Laguiller's unabashedly unglamorous manner has struck a chord
with hip leftist intellectuals. People like the 62-year-old retired bank
clerk and representative to the largely symbolic European Parliament
because of her steadfast commitment to her ideals.</TE>
<TE>   "She has run for president five times, so everybody knows her,"
Giacometti said. "She's seen as an emblem of protest and dependability at
a time of a crisis of political representation."</TE>
<TE>   It's another sign of the cantankerous political mood that the man
trailing "Arlette," as everyone calls her, is a gloomy Gaullist.
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, once a defense and interior minister for the
Socialists, appeals to nostalgic nationalists with his vision of a France
dragged down by lawlessness, meddlesome EU bureaucrats and that
all-purpose political demon, U.S. imperialism.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing up the rear are an ecologist, a proponent of the hunting and
fishing lobby, and an assortment of leftists and rightists.</TE>
<TE>   The rowdiest entertainment has come from the standard-bearer of the
Union for French Democracy, centrist Francois Bayrou. As cameras rolled
in Strasbourg recently, he faced down hecklers and slapped a youngster
who allegedly tried to pick his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Slow-motion replays of the resounding slap gave Bayrou a boost among
frustrated viewers who believe that criminals are running amok in the
country. Complicating that scrappy image, though, Bayrou was hit with a
couple of hurled pies at a subsequent campaign stop.</TE>

<HD>In Setback to Vatican, Russia Blocks Bishop's Reentry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russian passport officers have refused reentry to a Roman Catholic
bishop who was returning to his diocese, in effect revoking his right to
live and work in Russia and escalating the country's conflict with the
Vatican, Catholic officials said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Jerzy Mazur, a Polish citizen who is one of four Catholic
bishops in Russia, arrived at Moscow's main international airport Friday
with a valid visa, saw it canceled on the spot and was forced to fly back
to Warsaw.</LD>
<LD>   Mazur "was expelled from Russia without any explanation," said Igor
Kovalevsky, general secretary of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of
Russia. "Russia's Catholics may get the impression that a wide-scale
anti-Catholic campaign is underway in Russia in which state structures
are regrettably taking part."</LD>
<TE>   In Rome on Saturday, the Vatican issued a stern protest to the Russian
ambassador. Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls termed the incident a
"grave violation."</TE>
<TE>   Mazur was the second Catholic cleric expelled by Russian officials in
recent weeks. Earlier this month, Italian priest Stefano Caprio had his
valid visa confiscated by Russian passport control and was asked to
leave. He was told that he was on a "blacklist" compiled by Russian
secret services.</TE>
<TE>   "Every country in the world, including the United States, has a list
of certain citizens from other countries who are banned from entering
that country," deputy border service director Alexander Yeryomin told
Echo of Moscow radio Saturday. He provided no further explanation for
revoking the visas.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's relations with the Catholic Church have been tense for many
years, largely because the Orthodox Church jealously guards its
prerogatives as the country's dominant faith. Since the Soviet Union's
collapse, church leaders have repeatedly complained about "proselytizing"
by "foreign" churches, particularly Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church is behind
this both cynical and blunt campaign," said Anatoly Pchelintsev, director
of the Institute of Religion and Law in Moscow. "It is no secret that at
least half of Russian Orthodox hierarchs are either former or current
agents of the KGB [and its successor the] FSB, which have a great
influence in Russian power structures."</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Catholics and the Russian Orthodox have worsened
considerably since Pope John Paul II visited Ukraine and Kazakhstan last
year and the Vatican established formal dioceses in Russia in February.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian Orthodox Church considers Russia and the former Soviet
republics to be its "canonical territory" and says no other church has
the right to form dioceses, the seat of a bishop. (Mazur heads the
Irkutsk diocese, which covers 4,000 square miles of eastern Siberia and
is territorially the world's largest Catholic diocese.)</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church also believes
that it has the right to approve or block visits by other religious
figures, and it has complained that the pope did not receive such
permission before visiting Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul has made no secret of his desire to make a Russian visit,
which would be a kind of victory lap in a papacy marked by the collapse
of communism and the rebirth of Catholicism in much of Eastern Europe,
including his native Poland.</TE>
<TE>   But although Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has said he is
amenable to a visit by the pope, he says the Orthodox Church's approval
is required. And the Russian patriarch, Alexi II, has blocked a visit for
years, saying the Vatican must first make concessions to Orthodox wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Pchelintsev said other churches around the world do not claim the same
prerogatives as the Russian Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept of canonical territory . . . has never been accepted by
any other confession," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of Russia's 144 million people, two-thirds describe themselves as
Orthodox and about 600,000 as Catholic. In an interview with The Times in
2000, Mazur said that many of the latter are descendants of Poles,
Lithuanians, Germans and other Catholics sent to Siberia as exiles.
Preaching to them is not proselytizing but helping them reclaim their
past, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Their grandfathers were Catholics. And they have the right to hear
the word of God," Mazur said then.</TE>
<TE>   But many Russians see Catholic intentions as a sinister attempt to
undermine the Orthodox Church by taking advantage of its weaknesses as it
reestablishes itself in the post-Communist world.</TE>
<TE>   "These unilateral acts of the Vatican [are] an unfriendly step
indicating that the Vatican ignores the rights and interest of the
largest Orthodox Church in the world, which is living through a difficult
period of its revival after cruel persecutions," a spokesman for the
Moscow patriarchate told the Itar-Tass news agency last week. "All this
only delays prospects for a meeting with the pope of Rome."</TE>

<HD>In Kosovo, Ethnicity Outranks Faith</HD>
<DH>Europe: Although the province's residents are mostly Muslim, they
identify primarily with their Albanian roots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>When international peacekeepers announced the arrest a few months
ago of three foreigners who ran an Islamic charity in Kosovo, fears
quickly spread that the province was going the way of Bosnia, where
Islamic fundamentalists appear to have gained a foothold.</LD>
<LD>   The minarets of shiny new mosques--built with money from the Arab
world--were springing up in Kosovo's villages and larger towns, just as
they had in Bosnia-Herzegovina after its war. And, as in Bosnia, a number
of Islamic organizations had set up shop, offering assistance to ethnic
Albanian families traumatized by a 1999 Serbian campaign against them and
proselytizing the more devout form of Islam practiced in the Arab world.</LD>
<LD>   But appearances turned out to be deceiving. Although Kosovo, the
U.N.-run province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, has a
similar profile to that of Bosnia--a large Muslim population grateful for
help in the wake of a painful war--the similarities end there.</LD>
<TE>   "The religion of Albanians is Albanian-hood," said Naim Trnava, the
principal of the only madrasa, or Islamic religious school, in Kosovo.
"We are Albanians, and we belong to the Muslim faith. And the greatest
joy we ever had in our lives was the night the U.S. bombing started
against Serbia."</TE>
<TE>   Trnava, a typical ethnic Albanian in many respects, wore a dark
business suit and tie as he talked in his roomy headmaster's office,
which seemed devoid of any religious symbols. None of the accouterments
of faith, such as the prayer rugs or wall plaques with Koranic verses on
them that are typical among religion teachers in the Arab world, were in
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Kosovo Albanians, who make up the vast majority of the population in
the province, perceive themselves as Albanians first and Muslims second.
They view Americans as their best friends because the United States used
its military might to force former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to retreat from a campaign of "ethnic cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   Probably more than any other place in the world where the majority of
the population is Muslim, people here rallied to the support of America
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Posters still dot Pristina, the provincial capital, with photos of the
World Trade Center's twin towers on fire and beneath them the words: "We
Will Not Forget" and "Terror Can Not Win."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, a number of Islamic charities see little long-term
role for themselves in Kosovo. "The Muslims here behave like Christians,"
said Faris Haddaj Hadi, who runs the Saudi Joint Relief Committee for
Kosovo, one of the largest of the Islamic charities operating in the
province.</TE>
<TE>   "They do not pray five times a day. They are not bad Muslims, but they
have accepted living like in Europe," he said. "I think in 10 years it
will be worse--there is no influence of Islam here. We will not stay."</TE>
<TE>   Haddaj said the organization, which has contributed to the rebuilding
of 11 mosques, won't undertake any more mosque construction and will
remain in the province only to finish up other projects, such as the
building and operation of a laparoscopic surgery clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Intellectuals, politicians and religious figures agree that recent
history as well as cultural traditions and the complex roots of the
Albanian identity make the situation in Kosovo deeply different from that
in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   The 1992-95 war in Bosnia--which pitted Serbs, who are largely Eastern
Orthodox, against Croats, who are largely Roman Catholic, and Bosnian
Muslims--became focused largely on the religious differences among the
three groups, because all of them were ethnic Slavs, sharing a common
language.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Serbian campaign in Kosovo was brief, lasting just
months, and the difference between the Serbs and the Albanians was
primarily one of ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, whereas U.S. forces didn't get involved in the Bosnian
war until after the slaughter of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in
Srebrenica in 1995, they moved quickly into Kosovo. That forestalled the
need for the Kosovo Albanians to turn, as the Bosnian Muslims had, to
Iran and the Arab world for guns and moujahedeen fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Albanians have long viewed themselves as a unique people whose very
survival hinges on retaining a strong sense of their ethnic identity,
regardless of their religious faith. There are many Catholic Albanians,
primarily in Albania, and even a small number of Orthodox Albanians,
mainly in southern Italy.</TE>
<TE>   And, although Serbs blew up, shelled or torched about 225
mosques--more than a third of those in Kosovo, according to a Harvard art
historian who recently testified at the war crimes tribunal in The
Hague--the buildings had as much cultural meaning as religious
significance for many Kosovo Albanians.</TE>
<TE>   Soaring minarets are a feature of Balkan mosques, where the tall tower
acts as a kind of signpost of the presence in Kosovo of an Albanian
community in the midst of the Slavic landscape--a design similar to that
of the old Christian churches in the region, with their tall steeples,
noted Don Nosh Gjolaj, an Albanian Catholic priest in Pristina.</TE>
<TE>   This architectural preference strikes some Middle Eastern Muslims as
odd, because their mosques have less dramatic minarets.</TE>
<TE>   "The Albanians like these very tall minarets," said the Saudi
charity's Haddaj, shrugging. "Not at all like our minarets in Saudi
Arabia. We don't need them so tall."</TE>
<TE>   But to farmers and day laborers, the tall minarets and simple wooden
mosques are familiar markers, and the new Middle Eastern-style mosques
seem an intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't ask for a new mosque--they just came and built it," said
Osman Rexhepi, 74, a Muslim farmer who was tending a flock of chickens in
Slatina, a small town near Pristina where the Saudi relief committee has
built a mosque that appears to be made of concrete and metal.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the old one better," Rexhepi added a bit wistfully, nodding
toward a simple wooden building, now pockmarked with bullet holes but
with its minaret proudly standing.</TE>
<TE>   Although these stylistic differences might sound trivial, they matter
considerably to the local population, several Kosovo Albanians said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, we made an agreement with the Islamic organizations
that any new mosques they built should be like the old mosques in style,"
said Qemajl Morina, vice dean of the Islamic Faculty, which runs Kosovo's
only Muslim university where imams are trained.</TE>
<TE>   "But in some places, they built them in the new style anyway," he
said. "But we have an agreement that after they build them, they cannot
organize anything about how Islam should be taught there."</TE>
<TE>   Though it is impossible to guarantee that fundamentalist groups won't
enter Kosovo, especially given that the borders are porous and pockets of
sympathy for them probably exist here, as they do throughout the Muslim
world, it appears unlikely that they will be able to take root.</TE>
<TE>   With this backdrop, it seemed hardly surprising to residents when
peacekeepers released the three employees of the Islamic charity who had
been detained on suspicion that they were financing terrorists. The three
employees, two of whom were Iranians, were let go Jan. 29, and all the
documents that had been seized were returned.</TE>
<TE>   "At present, we have no evidence of terrorist activity in Kosovo,"
said Drew Anderson, a spokesman for the peacekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   That is unlikely to change, said Shkelzen Maliqi, a Pristina-based
writer and publisher. "Young people imitate the life in the West. You'll
find a lot of bars serving alcohol even in rural villages.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about a place that is totally pro-Western and
Western-oriented even in the smallest villages," Maliqi said.</TE>

<HD>Hungary's Divided Voters Seek 'Better Opportunities'</HD>
<DH>Politics: Support in the second round of the parliamentary election
falls along class lines. Socialists are favored to win, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary
</DL>
<LD>Elementary school teacher Iren Potharn believes that the old
Communist system had some good points and that a Socialist victory in
elections today could bring back egalitarian values and give poor people
a better deal.</LD>
<LD>   But Imre Csonka, the manager of a Mazda dealership, says the
beleaguered center-right government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban
deserves credit for nurturing the emergence of a middle class. Many of
these newly prosperous voters are afraid of losing everything they've
gained if the ex-Communists of the Hungarian Socialist Party come back to
power, he said.</LD>
<LD>   As Hungary goes to the polls for a second and decisive round of
parliamentary voting, society is broadly divided. Ironically, the policy
differences between the two leading parties are nowhere near as sharp as
the contrast in their supporters.</LD>
<TE>   Those who suffered under the Soviet-imposed dictatorship or are young
enough to have adapted to the insecurities, competition and opportunities
of capitalism generally support Orban's FiDeSz-Hungarian Civic Party. The
Socialists draw votes from those who once benefited from ties to the
Communist Party or at least believed that the system wasn't so bad.</TE>
<TE>   But everyone agrees that a return to the past is impossible. Hungary,
like neighbors Poland and the Czech Republic, has been completely
transformed since the 1989-90 fall of communism. In all three countries,
there is a consensus in favor of democracy and market economics.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to imagine that former Communists are stupid people
who can't change," said Judit Beer, 55, an official of a medical workers
union, who was a Communist for nearly 20 years and now favors the
Socialists. "Life changes, and you have to adapt. . . . The Hungarian
Socialist Workers' Party [the old Communist Party] was against
capitalism. But from the time it was founded, the Hungarian Socialist
Party was never against capital."</TE>
<TE>   After the Communists agreed in late 1989 to give up their political
monopoly, reformers controlling the party dropped "Workers" from its name
and pledged support for democracy and a free-market economy.</TE>
<TE>   These reform-minded Socialists went on to hold power from 1994 to
1998, carrying out massive privatization, running an economic austerity
program to put government finances in order, and laying the groundwork
for Hungary to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That gave
them pro-market credentials, even if some people such as Csonka, 39, the
Mazda dealer, still don't trust them.</TE>
<TE>Rise in Stocks Cited</TE>
<TE>   When the Socialists came out ahead in first-round balloting April 7,
prices rose sharply on the local stock exchange, which "shows that for
capitalists, the Socialist party offers better opportunities," said Gobor
Torok, a political scientist at the Budapest University of Economic
Sciences and Public Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Socialists won 42% of votes in the first round, to 41% for the
FiDeSz-led alliance. Of the 185 parliamentary seats decided in the first
round from a total of 386, the Socialists won 93, their allies the
Alliance of Free Democrats won four, and FiDeSz took 87. One more seat
went to a candidate nominated by both the Socialists and the Free
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   For the final round today, the Socialists and the Free Democrats have
formed an alliance in which the two parties put up just one candidate in
each district still up for grabs. Analysts say that virtually assures
them control of parliament--and the right to name a prime minister--if
voting percentages remain about the same.</TE>
<TE>   Orban, speaking at a massive rally in Budapest, the capital, after his
party's first-round setback, criticized the Socialists, declaring, "We
cannot have a country where one party pretends to be socially sensitive
but in reality disguises a government formed by big finance and big
capital."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Socialists reject that charge as campaign rhetoric, the
fact that Orban would even make such a statement shows how great the
post-Communist transformation has been. Those who believe that Orban's
charge makes sense point out that many from the old Communist elite have
benefited from the changes--and some have even become rich capitalists.</TE>
<TE>   "At the change of system, these people were in good positions, and
they could get ownership of the best companies and best factories during
the privatization process," Torok said. "Regardless of that, the program
of the Socialist party is a social democratic one. The basic difference
is that FiDeSz would like to support the middle class and the Hungarian
Socialist Party would like to support those who can't catch up."</TE>
<TE>   The Socialists' candidate for prime minister is ex-Communist and
former banker Peter Medgyessy. The 59-year-old served the Communist
government during its waning years in the late 1980s as finance minister
and deputy prime minister, then was finance minister again from 1996 to
1998 under the Socialist-led government. The Socialists picked him as
their candidate for prime minister even though he has never joined the
party.</TE>
<TE>   At campaign appearances, Medgyessy and Prime Minister Orban have
competed in promising voters greater social benefits paired with tax
cuts. "The politicians promise both, although it's impossible to carry
out," Torok said. "They think the voters are expecting them to do this."</TE>
<TE>Pain of Transition</TE>
<TE>   If the Socialists win today, as most analysts predict, that would
continue a general pattern seen in post-Communist countries of Eastern
Europe in which voters usually throw out governing parties, no matter
their ideology, the first chance they get.</TE>
<TE>   This partly reflects the pain of transition, in which governments
moving toward a market economy pursue policies that lead to unemployment
and growing gaps between rich and poor. Impossibly extravagant campaign
pledges and the inside deals often associated with privatization also
contribute to voter disillusionment.</TE>
<TE>   Medgyessy has played on the nostalgia that some feel for the security
of the old system, when jobs were guaranteed and many social services
were free.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need two times 5 million Hungarians but 10 million
Hungarians where the country is not divided," he said at a recent
campaign rally, implying that Orban's policies have split the nation in
two: prosperous and poor.</TE>
<TE>   Orban, 38, has positioned his party as economically centrist but
culturally conservative, emphasizing Hungarian patriotism, religious
faith and family values while stressing the need for people to take
charge of their own destinies. He is often seen to possess the brashness
of youth, as he rather aggressively challenges his fellow citizens to
make the most of their new opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The nationalist and religious tinge to Orban's campaign has provoked a
backlash among some Hungarians. At an Orban rally last week in Gyor, the
crowd joined in singing a well-known Roman Catholic song of love for the
nation: "For Hungary, for our sweet country. . . . Holy Mary, don't
forget about poor Hungary."</TE>

<HD>Deadlock Leaves Congo Peace Talks in Disarray</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The future of talks aimed at ending Congo's 3 1/2-year war was
thrown into confusion Saturday after negotiations deadlocked over the
makeup of a new government and a temporary constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Contradictory reports came from former Botswana President Ketumile
Masire, the chief mediator, on whether talks would resume Monday in South
Africa as planned. The talks involve Congo's government, the nation's two
main rebel movements and a number of opposition political groups.</LD>
<LD>   A Masire aide told delegates Saturday that all sides would resume
talks in three weeks at an undisclosed location, said Olivier Kamitatu,
secretary-general of the rebel Congo Liberation Movement, or MLC.</LD>
<TE>   But Masire later assured rebel leaders that negotiations would proceed
in South Africa as originally planned, said Azarias Ruberwa,
secretary-general of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy, or RCD, the
other major rebel group.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know whether there will be a meeting on Monday,"
Kamitatu said after canceling plans to fly to Congo, formerly known as
Zaire. "The situation is confused at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   A suggestion by South African peace brokers for a smaller group of
delegates to remain behind to try to resolve two key issues was snubbed
by the Congolese government, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The talks deadlocked Friday after Masire rejected a power-sharing deal
struck behind the scenes between the government and the Ugandan-backed
MLC that would have isolated the RCD, which is backed by Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   The RCD rejected the deal, which would allow President Joseph Kabila
to keep his present position in a transitional government and make MLC
chief Jean-Pierre Bemba the prime minister. The larger RCD was offered
the presidency of Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations are part of a process defined in the 1999 cease-fire
agreement signed by the government, rebels and their foreign backers,
that is aimed at ending the war in the Central African nation. Rwanda and
Uganda back the rebels, and Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia back the
government.</TE>
<TE>   In the talks, consensus was reached on the need to integrate
government and rebel forces in a new national army, rebuild a united
Congo, set up a tribunal to prosecute those responsible for massacres of
civilians and form a South African-style truth and reconciliation
commission.</TE>
<TE>   But without agreement on a transitional government, none of these
objectives is attainable.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The fragile nature of Afghanistan's peace was evident Saturday as
French peacekeepers were fired on, a plot to assassinate the returned
former king was uncovered and parents were threatened with death for
educating their children.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Afghan refugees continued streaming home by the tens of
thousands from camps abroad, perhaps the best indication that many
believe that their country is moving away from decades of war.</LD>
<LD>   A French soldier suffered a slight leg injury Friday night when gunmen
opened fire on his patrol near the airport in Kabul, said Capt. Serge
Khun, spokesman for international peacekeepers responsible for security
in the capital.</LD>
<TE>   The four attackers escaped, Khun said.</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram air base, 30 miles north of Kabul, British Royal Marines
said Saturday that they had received reports that assassins posing as
journalists might try to kill Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zaher
Shah, who returned Thursday after nearly three decades of exile in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   No other details were available.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, leaflets threatening death to parents who send their children
to school were found in Kandahar, once the spiritual headquarters of the
deposed Taliban regime, which restricted education, an Afghan official
said Saturday.</TE>

<LD>President Chen Shui-bian won his bid to become leader of Taiwan's
ruling party, reneging on a key campaign promise to distance himself from
the party and be a "president for all the people."</LD>
<LD>   Democratic Progressive Party members in Taipei, the capital, voted
unanimously to amend the party charter to specify that whenever Taiwan's
president is a DPP member, he will also head the party.</LD>
<LD>   Chen's successful effort to take the helm of the party appeared to
signal the end of his attempts to create a coalition government and stay
above partisan politics. Chen had promised to maintain a clear line
between party and state.</LD>

<HD>Iran's Top Opponent is Back Home</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Ibrahim Yazdi, who underwent cancer treatment in the U.S.,
vows to continue his fight against hard-line clerics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN
</DL>
<LD>The chief opponent of Iran's ruling clerics returned Saturday from
the United States in a surprising gesture that could give fresh momentum
to reformists facing a relentless crackdown.</LD>
<LD>   Ailing but still defiant, Ibrahim Yazdi promised to continue his
efforts to bring more openness to Iranian society and weaken the grip of
the conservative theocracy.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll have no political retirement. I will continue the previous
policies. My poor health cannot prevent me from fulfilling my
responsibilities to my people," Yazdi told more than 200 supporters--many
only recently freed from prison--who met him at the Tehran airport.</LD>
<TE>   Some wept at the sight of Yazdi, who looked weak from a long battle
with cancer. A garland was placed around his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy to be back to my homeland," Yazdi said, sobbing.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old Yazdi left Iran in November 2000 to undergo cancer
treatment in Houston. Since his departure, Iranian authorities have come
down hard on perceived opponents--closing more than 50 publications and
jailing dozens of journalists, academics and activists. Yazdi's return
opens a fresh challenge to the leadership.</TE>
<TE>   The staunchly conservative judiciary has issued an arrest warrant for
Yazdi on charges of plotting to overthrow the Islamic Republic. There was
no immediate move to take him into custody, but it's unlikely the arrest
order from the powerful Revolutionary Court could be ignored for long.</TE>
<TE>   Yazdi leads the now-banned Freedom Movement, which played a central
role in the 1979 Islamic Revolution but later turned against the clerics
as they consolidated power and crushed any dissent.</TE>

<HD>Koizumi Pays Another Visit to War Shrine</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi paid a surprise visit
today to a controversial shrine devoted to Japan's war dead, a move that
immediately triggered anger in neighboring South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Koizumi wore a black tie and tails as he followed a Shinto priest
through the cypress pillars of Yasukuni shrine, which honors some war
criminals among the 2.5 million Japanese war dead.</LD>
<LD>   Regional observers attach significance to whether visits to the shrine
by Cabinet officials are made in a public or private capacity--and
Koizumi made no effort to disguise that he went as the nation's leader.</LD>
<TE>   "My visit was as Japan's prime minister," he told reporters after the
visit. "The purpose . . . was to pay respect to those who left behind
family and sacrificed their lives for the nation."</TE>
<TE>   However, in a gesture likely to assuage some bitterness over the
visit, Koizumi said he would not visit Yasukuni in August--the period
when Japan marks its surrender in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's trip last August to the shrine, where convicted war
criminals are worshiped, infuriated South Korea, China and other Asian
countries that suffered from Japanese militarism.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear why Koizumi chose to visit today.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Put Peace on Fast Track, Powell Tells Bush</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Amid the secretary's call for a quick endgame, officials
meet at Camp David to pursue a solution for the Israelis and
Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush huddled with his top security advisors at Camp David
on Saturday to thrash out what to do about the Mideast maelstrom amid a
growing perception that the crisis now boils down to the very existence
of Israel alongside a Palestinian state--and finding one last formula to
make that work.</LD>
<LD>   The summit in the tranquillity of the Maryland woods--attended by
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, CIA Director George J. Tenet and
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice--grappled with the one stark
new reality to emerge from Powell's recent 10-day trip to the region: The
administration needs to develop a strategy to get quickly to the endgame
rather than focus on more interim agreements or phases on the road to
eventual peace.</LD>
<LD>   "After Powell's trip, we certainly have a clearer appreciation of
where all the parties stand, what is possible at the moment and what are
the most promising paths to go down," said National Security Council
spokesman Sean McCormick.</LD>
<TE>   Added a State Department official involved in the diplomacy who asked
to remain anonymous: "We're at nosebleed levels about where this goes
next. The administration has to make a lot of tough choices."</TE>
<TE>   For the weekend retreat, according to U.S. officials, Powell brought
some powerful conclusions from his trip for discussion. Most were sure to
spark debate. Some might be difficult for the White House to accept,
reflecting a significant gap between the White House and State Department
on certain aspects of the crisis. But all have to be faced, according to
both U.S. officials and Mideast experts.</TE>
<TE>   First, Powell is telling the administration that Israelis and
Palestinians are so estranged that, for now, the chasm separating them
cannot be bridged through gradual confidence-building measures on
security. The security and political phases of a peace process, outlined
sequentially by two previous U.S.-orchestrated plans, should be merged.
Israeli concerns about peace and stability need to parallel action on a
political track that addresses the aspirations of the Palestinians--and
prevents them from resorting to violence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's now clear that we're beyond a phased process of peacemaking.
Given the pain and rage of the past few weeks, there's no way to stop
this cycle [of violence] incrementally," said Shibley Telhami, holder of
the Anwar Sadat chair in peace and development at the University of
Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "There has to
be something dramatic that will change the reality on the ground."</TE>
<TE>Palestinian Statehood Focus of Discussions</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials increasingly talk of moving to the
establishment of a Palestinian state, with less focus on rebuilding the
shattered Palestinian Authority as a preliminary step.</TE>
<TE>   "Improvement in the security situation must be linked to the second
point--determined pursuit of a political solution. There can be no peace
without security, but there can also be no security without peace,"
Powell said before leaving Jerusalem for home Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Powell has taken the firm position that Israeli troops and
tanks must withdraw fully from the occupied territories--and also end the
practice of search-and-arrest return raids after they have departed.</TE>
<TE>   This demand might prove contentious, for the president appeared to
backtrack last week, under congressional and domestic political pressure,
from several earlier calls on Israel to withdraw immediately. On
Thursday, he said Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had "met the
timetable" he outlined for pulling out. And in his Saturday radio
address, Bush said only that Israel "must continue" removing its troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Powell has to convince Bush that the United States can't move on any
front until the Israelis are really and truly out. It's the top
priority," the State Department official said. "This may not be easy
because the president's getting hammered on the Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Third, Powell will explain that Yasser Arafat has to be accepted as
the Palestinian leader--and Sharon will have to face dealing with him,
directly or indirectly, whether he wants to.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis increasingly speak of expelling Arafat, a fate he narrowly
avoided once already at the onset of the current offensive when Powell
telephoned Sharon and said Washington would view that as a tactical
mistake, according to Israeli officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has had only tough admonitions for Arafat and appears to feel
disdain for him. But in talks with four Arab leaders and the European
Union before heading to Israel, Powell was repeatedly told that Arafat
was elected by the Palestinians and accepted by most of the world--and
that neither Israel nor the United States could alter that.</TE>
<TE>Arabs Unite Behind an Embattled Arafat</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs, who just last month offered Israel full recognition in
exchange for its withdrawal from all occupied land, bluntly made clear
that they will not participate in any peace effort without Arafat. More
important to the White House, they also made clear that it would be
difficult for them to help further in the war on terrorism if the U.S.
backed a move by Sharon to either expel or marginalize the Palestinian
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, Powell is advocating that the United States will have to play
an ongoing and more high-profile role--all the way up to the White
House--to prevent both an escalation of the raging violence and a wider
regional conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes are currently in a comparative lull, as Israel begins
withdrawing from some areas and the Palestinians, their extremist cells
disrupted or in hiding, pick through the physical and political debris
left behind. And Powell's one clear success was defusing tensions along
Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Hezbollah has pulled back, and the
daily attacks there, which coincided with the Israeli incursion, have
ceased.</TE>
<TE>   But absent some progress, few believe that the calm on either front
will last. In his Saturday radio address, Bush said progress on peace
will require "hard choices and real leadership" by Palestinians, Israelis
and Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   And once hostilities heat up again, State Department officials say,
the choice will be stark: Either continue diplomacy to keep a U.S. finger
in the dike or do what's necessary to finish the endgame.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole tragedy is that, for the first time in 50 years, there is a
solution on the table. Sharon's party is no longer pushing the idea of
Greater Israel. Arabs at the Arab League summit codified the end of the
conflict, as Israel has demanded all these days. And the vast majority of
Palestinians and Israelis accept the idea of negotiations and a two-state
solution. But neither leader will take a step forward without being
forced to do so," said Judith Kipper, director of the Mideast program at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Bush administration is deeply reengaged, U.S. officials
acknowledge that it will be difficult to back out or diminish that role.
Indeed, the United States may well find itself blamed for future Israeli
or Palestinian deaths because of its failure to break the deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration will now have to be very hands-on, using its
full clout and persuasive powers, paying for this or that, and taking the
various players by the scruffs of their necks to where they need to go
for their own interests," Kipper said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is certain to hear strong appeals for more decisive U.S. action
when he meets with two key Arab leaders this week. Morocco's King
Mohammed VI's first question to Powell when they met two weeks ago was
why he hadn't gone straight to Jerusalem. And Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah, who at U.S. urging crafted the new Arab League initiative on a
full peace with Israel, feels that his kingdom--not to mention his
political neck--is on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a critical juncture for the administration," Telhami said.
"Whatever strategy is chosen, it has no chance of success unless the
president is fully invested behind it and makes the case to the American
public to be fully invested behind it."</TE>

<HD>Causes Merge in Support of Palestine</HD>
<DH>Protest: Tens of thousands gather in the nation's capital, with
attention focused on the Middle East conflict.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Myriad protest causes developed into a massive and peaceful show of
support for the Palestinian people Saturday, as tens of thousands of
demonstrators jammed Washington's downtown streets to criticize the Bush
administration's Middle East policy.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of Palestinian flags waved above the crowd, and many
marchers--representing a range of races, religions and ages--wore
stickers proclaiming: "We are all Palestinians."</LD>
<LD>   The day was designated as an "extravaganza" of protests by activists
who came from throughout the country. It began with four distinct rallies
in the morning that merged into one march near the White House that
filled Pennsylvania Avenue all the way to the Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   Police presence was heavy, particularly near the World Bank
headquarters, where anti-globalization activists protested international
monetary policies. While such protests have been trouble-prone in the
past, with Washington police arresting nearly 1,300 two years ago during
International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings, there were no
reported arrests and little trouble Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, the anti-globalization forces were joined by a
pro-Palestinian contingent that had marched from the Washington Hilton,
the site of this weekend's annual conference of the American Israeli
Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israeli lobby.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, two rallies taking place on The Mall--one
pro-Palestine and the other a student-led antiwar demonstration--folded
in as well. As the groups became a single mass of people, passions
centered on the conflict in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   An oversized papier mache puppet depicting Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon dripping in blood rose above the marchers, and placards
equated him to Adolf Hitler. One group of men hoisted a wooden coffin
high on their shoulders and a young child rested aloft to represent
Palestinian children killed in the ongoing fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Some marchers pounded a rhythmic beat on plastic buckets with sticks,
providing a bass line to the occasional cacophony of whoops and shouts
emitted by the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Others chanted: "Free, free Palestine!" and "Bush, Sharon what do you
say? How many kids have you killed today?"</TE>
<TE>   Some antiwar protesters commented on the irony of banners emblazoned
with the peace sign juxtaposed with the chant, "Viva intifada!" in
support of the Palestinian uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Smith, 27, an artist from Oakland, said he came "just to stand
together in solidarity. Stand together for peace. No more escalation of
war."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's march was described by one organizer as the largest
demonstration for Palestine in U.S. history, and it came less than a week
after the largest pro-Israeli demonstration in Washington since 1987.
Organizers of a pro-Israeli march, which took place Monday on the same
grounds near the Capitol where Saturday's march ended, claimed more than
100,000 people came on less than a week's notice.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and District of Columbia authorities do not give crowd
estimates in an effort to avoid political controversy. But both rallies
were clearly substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Absent Saturday was any speaker approaching the political prominence
of those who appeared at the pro-Israeli rally, such as House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) and President Bush's deputy Defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Palestine voices were also heard in San Francisco, where about
15,000 demonstrators sprawled across a lawn in front of City Hall,
chanting "Free, free Palestine!"</TE>
<TE>   At a counterprotest Saturday on The Mall, dubbed the Patriot's Rally,
U.S. flag-draped men guarded the portable toilets at their sparsely
attended event. A handwritten sign directed "cowards and traitors" who
had come to protest the war on terrorism to go away.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, there were anarchists in black bandannas walking near a
group of Jews opposed to Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Muslim
mothers in traditional burkas carried babies in their arms, sweating in
the summerlike heat. Students in tie-dyed shirts and brightly hued hair
marched alongside aging peaceniks who recalled the massive antiwar
demonstrations 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers acknowledged the broad range of issues made it difficult
for everyone to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   "From a P.R. perspective, it can confuse things," said David Levy, a
member of Mobilization for Global Justice, whose anti-World Bank event
was overshadowed by Palestinian sentiment. "But from a movement-building
perspective, it's great, because you feel this tremendous burst of
political awareness and empowerment."</TE>
<TE>   And many who came for other reasons said they were comfortable with
the direction the day took.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Zbrozek, 18, who came to the rally from Sterling Heights, Mich.,
with his father, said the pro-Palestinian cause was aligned with the
antiwar sentiment. "The Israelis say their justification for their
massacres is that they're fighting terrorism. It's the exact same
justification we use in Afghanistan, that we're going to use against
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Zbrozek, 49, who was attending his first such demonstration,
said, "It only causes more terrorism. And it only endangers more
Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Tariq Ali, a Pakistani playwright, was among the speakers addressing
the pro-Palestine rally. He told his listeners that the "rogues are in
the White House and the rogue state is Israel."</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem in the world is state terrorism," Ali said. "And the
people who organize that terrorism are in Tel Aviv and their backers are
in the White House."</TE>

<DH>Dissent: A self-styled 'old lefty from the '60s' finds kindred
spirits at the antiwar rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN C. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>She's been called anti-American and anti-Semitic by her students
for criticizing the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and Israeli policies in
the Middle East, but professor Karen Dugger remains adamant that
government-sanctioned violence only begets more violence.</LD>
<LD>   "What primarily brought me here was an extreme sadness for the state
of the world," Dugger said as she stood on the grassy Ellipse behind the
White House during Saturday's rally supporting the Palestinian cause and
opposing the U.S. war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "That sadness comes from empathizing with the pain of people who are
being slaughtered, oppressed and degraded. It comes from compassion, from
understanding how we're all connected."</LD>
<TE>   Dugger, a self-styled "old lefty from the '60s," said her current
antiwar stance has been a lonelier experience. But she found solace
Saturday, surrounded by tens of thousands of kindred spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really speak out," Dugger said, referring to the
overwhelming public support for the Bush administration's military
response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "Here we can speak out
because we're all together."</TE>
<TE>   Dugger, 54, of Alexandria, Va., who teaches women's studies at Towson
University in Maryland, said her opposition to the U.S. war effort should
not be construed as support for Al Qaeda or its ally, the Taliban that
ruled Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was horrified by the Taliban's subjugation of women well
before Sept. 11. And she said the United States was justified in freezing
the assets of those with links to Al Qaeda and going after those directly
responsible for sending hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "But doing it at the cost of what they call collateral damage--the
killing of innocents--is too high a price," Dugger said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, she said, "Sept. 11 created a justification for fascism.
Fascism is permeating American society right now."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said, Jewish students accused her of being
anti-Semitic when she discussed "the history of colonization of the
Palestinians" while teaching about women of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
And one student suggested she was anti-American for challenging the war
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been difficult because it questions your soul," Dugger said,
trembling visibly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her sympathy for the Palestinians, Dugger has no support for
the suicide bombers who target Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "They're killers too," she said. "Basically, it is a stupid,
politically uninformed way of trying to bring about justice for the
people. . . . You don't come up against a superior power with violence
because they could annihilate you, which is what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   Dugger traced her left-wing activism to opposition to the Vietnam War
as a college student. She was a senior at Kent State University in Ohio
when National Guardsmen opened fire on antiwar protesters, killing four
students in May 1970. In despair, she recalled, she retreated to Venice,
Calif., in search of escape. Eventually, she became a Buddhist.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, she marched in Washington with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
Rainbow Coalition to protest the policies of then-President Reagan. She
volunteered for Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential campaign. Last year, she
traveled to Cuba, another of her causes, for an international women's
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Dugger, like other antiwar activists interviewed at Saturday's rally,
said she backed the event's heavy pro-Palestinian focus because of the
intensity of the current conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good being here today," Dugger said. "I was really worried
riding the [subway] down here that there wouldn't be enough people. . . .
This restores your hope.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a day for me that has broken the silence."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM CONEY ISLAND, N.Y.</KH>
<HD>Kicking the Bad News Aside, Many Answer Call to Go Play</HD>
<DH>Parks: Opening day for the historic boardwalk drew hundreds,
despite some lousy weather.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>First there was no winter. Then came August-like heat in April, and
on Saturday the skies darkened over Coney Island, bringing chilly winds
and sheets of rain.</LD>
<LD>   But if New Yorkers were fazed by the bizarre weather this year, they
didn't show it. Hundreds flocked to the boardwalk's unofficial opening
this weekend, and the amusement park that shut down for a long, dreary
winter began creaking back to life.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got to be a little meshuga to come out here on a day like
this," said Jules Allen, a retired actor, sitting on a park bench near
the immense Ferris wheel that gives Wonder Wheel Park its name. "But you
can't hide in your apartment. You have to live a little."</LD>
<TE>   Beyond the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, New York had its share of
trials in recent months: There was anthrax panic in the early fall, the
crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in the Rockaways just before
Thanksgiving, political agita over a $5-billion municipal deficit in
January and February, and a long spell of bone-dry weather that
aggravated a regional drought.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there were signs Saturday that people here are shaking off months
of bad news. As he watched his kids climb into the Tilt-A-Whirl, Michael
Ceretta, an assistant principal at a Brooklyn public school, said he
almost felt a civic obligation to have a good time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think New Yorkers will go out of their way this spring and summer
to enjoy themselves in public, especially after what's happened here,"
Ceretta said. As he spoke, rain clouds opened up over the boardwalk and
sent amusement park ride operators scurrying for cover.</TE>
<TE>   The children couldn't have cared less. "What a scary ride," said Chloe
Locarro, 7, tumbling out of the Astro-Whirl and shaking water out of her
hair. "I think I just had a heart attack!"</TE>
<TE>   As he stood near a ramshackle food stand offering paper plates of
clams, shish kebab, Italian sausage, fried shrimp, pizza, corn dogs and
french fries, Manhattan Realtor John Gallagher said his family plans to
come to Coney Island regularly this season, rain or shine. For them, he
said, having a good time is more important than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if it pours today or for the next three weeks,"
Gallagher added, watching his two children climb into a miniature boat
ride. "If only for the Cyclone, I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   That's the world-famous wooden roller coaster, which was whipping
screaming customers up, down and around, much as it has since opening in
1927. "I'm going to take that big ride," he said. " . . . You have a
truly insane experience. It's definitely not Disneyland."</TE>
<TE>   Not even close. This place has been dying and deteriorating for so
long, it should win a medal for endurance. Once a poor man's ocean
paradise, Coney Island is now a ghost of its former self. Vacationers
fled long ago to more hospitable beaches, in the Hamptons and other
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Yet somehow, like the city around it, Coney Island keeps getting off
the mat. Travelers from around the world still flock to Nathan's Famous
hot dog stand, and a new minor league ballpark has drawn thousands of new
visitors to the old beach community that once seemed to epitomize summer
fun.</TE>
<TE>   "People will never stop coming here, even on a lousy day like this,"
said Mike Goldstein, who has worked on the boardwalk and in the amusement
parks here for 48 years. "What you have now, with the rain, is the
hard-core crowd. They come out religiously, no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   Some make a special pilgrimage for the Blessing of the Rides at Wonder
Wheel Park. Every year, as winter gives way to spring, a priest conducts
a brief ceremony in the shadow of the Ferris wheel, voicing hopes that
summer will be happy and safe for all who come here.</TE>
<TE>   The immense, 400,000-pound wheel, built in 1920, was said to be the
first recognizable American landmark visible for millions of immigrants
who sailed into New York harbor at night.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the old magic's still there.</TE>
<TE>   "I smell summer!" said Eddie McDowell, a self-described boardwalk
poet, as he clambered out of the Ferris wheel. "Bless the wheel, bless
the rides. Bless us all."</TE>

<HD>For U.S., a Victory in Terrorism Fight, a Loss on the Trade Front</HD>
<DH>Finance: New steel tariffs and a proposal to replace development
loans with grants are assailed at monetary fund and World Bank meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States secured commitments from other wealthy countries
Saturday for better cooperation in the crackdown on terrorist finances
but found itself under fire on other fronts at a weekend gathering of
world finance officials.</LD>
<LD>   As protesters took to the streets to denounce the Bush
administration's international priorities, delegates attending the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were
taking their own shots at U.S. policy.</LD>
<LD>   Poor countries and World Bank officials objected to a U.S. proposal to
replace development loans with grants. Europe and other industrial
exporters fumed about newly imposed U.S. steel tariffs and discussed
possible retaliatory moves. IMF officials warned that the growing U.S.
trade deficit could imperil global prosperity.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the criticism reflected long-standing grievances, and some was
directed at affluent nations as a group. But some participants said they
think the United States has forfeited the moral high ground on certain
issues, particularly trade, and may have to work harder to get its way in
global policymaking.</TE>
<TE>   "There's quite a lot of sniping going on back and forth," said one
official, who requested anonymity. "Certainly the Europeans have felt
more empowered, and the World Bank has fought the [Bush] administration's
grant proposal tooth and nail."</TE>
<TE>   The grant debate is unusual because poor countries and many of their
advocates are opposing a proposal that would reduce their future debt
burdens. The Bush administration wants to replace up to 50% of
development lending with grants, arguing that projects to improve health
and education in poor countries typically do not generate the cash flow
needed to repay loans.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. position, championed this weekend by Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill, has encountered stiff opposition from the World Bank
staff, the European Community and the Group of 24, a coalition of
developing countries.</TE>
<TE>British Official Calls U.S. Proposal 'Crazy'</TE>
<TE>   Opponents said they fear that the U.S. plan, while well intentioned,
would undermine development funding because the World Bank depends on
cash flow from debt payments to replenish its accounts. The World Bank
has estimated the plan could reduce its development resources by as much
as $100 billion over the next 40 years. British development secretary
Claire Short called the Bush administration proposal "crazy."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration hasn't won many converts to its grant plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Group of Seven industrial countries--the United States, Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan--wrapped up two days of talks
Saturday without resolving the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   The administration had better luck on the issue of terrorist funding.
The G-7 agreed to cooperate more effectively to cut off sources of
financing for terrorist organizations. For the first time, the G-7 will
issue joint designations of terrorist entities and act in concert to
freeze their assets. U.S. officials have complained that America has been
more aggressive than some of its allies in taking action against
terrorist financiers.</TE>
<TE>   The G-7 also endorsed an administration proposal to help bankrupt
countries, such as Argentina, reach agreement with their creditors on
debt restructuring. Under the U.S. plan, developing country debt
contracts would contain a "contingency clause" that would enable a
majority of creditors to agree on a restructuring program even if a few
creditors remained opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Although the G-7 ministers hailed increasing signs that a global
recovery is in progress, they said Argentina's economic collapse remained
a "serious concern."</TE>
<TE>   According to IMF analysts, the growing U.S. trade deficit poses
another long-term risk to global security. IMF Chief Economist Kenneth
Rogoff said America's current account deficit, the broadest measure of
trade and investment flows between nations, is nearing a level that in
other countries has led to currency collapses. U.S. officials countered
that the trade gap actually reflects the attractiveness of the United
States as a place for foreigners to invest their funds.</TE>
<TE>Lower Trade Barriers Pushed</TE>
<TE>   Criticism of U.S. policy has been particularly pointed on trade.
Developing countries and their advocates pressed harder than ever to get
the United States, Europe and Japan to lower trade barriers that shut out
poor countries' key exports: textiles, apparel and agricultural products.</TE>
<TE>   The administration came also under attack by Europe, Japan and other
steel-producing countries for imposing tariffs of up to 30% on steel
imports to give the beleaguered U.S. industry more time to restructure.
The steel tariffs are not on the agenda of this weekend's meetings, but
they are frequently cited as examples of U.S. hypocrisy on trade policy.</TE>
<TE>   On that issue, at least, the view inside the IMF headquarters was not
that different from the critique offered by the protesters on the other
side of the police cordons.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. economy was very protectionist in the 19th century," said
Patrick Keaney, an anti-globalization activist from Boston. "We became
the strongest economy on Earth. Now we're asking these other countries to
compete with us without any of the protections we insisted on for
ourselves."</TE>

<LD>Despite a famous painting and at least three biographies depicting
Gen. Sam Houston as having been shot in the right ankle, the man who led
the battle of San Jacinto 166 years ago today seems to have a leg up on
historians.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Rice of the Sam Houston Memorial Museum in Huntsville, Texas,
recently found proof of the mistake in a letter Houston wrote to his
wife, Margaret, on Jan. 11, 1853, that he was wounded in the left leg.</LD>
<LD>   The seemingly trivial revelation casts a shadow on one of the most
famous paintings in Texas history, William Henry Huddle's 1886 depiction
of Santa Anna's surrender, which hangs in the state Capitol. In it,
Houston lies beneath an oak, his right ankle wounded.</LD>

<LD>A federal agent pleaded guilty to stealing nearly $50,000 in
evidence used in undercover investigations that targeted grocery stores
for food stamp fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Punka, 46, of Brunswick, the senior agent for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's office in Cleveland, helped investigators
arrest three Cleveland grocers who pleaded guilty last month to
laundering $15 million through banks in Ohio and the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of accepting the stamps for food purchases, the grocers
illegally accepted them for cash, paying about 60 cents on the dollar.
Punka was supposed to place the money in a safety deposit box in the
agency's name at a bank, but he kept some of the money.</LD>
<TE>   It is unclear what Punka did with the money. He faces up to 16 months
in prison.</TE>

<HD>A Newly Hamstrung Bush Faces 'Bumps in the Road'</HD>
<DH>Presidency: With the defeat of Arctic drilling and the stalemate in
the Mideast, the prospects for progress this year grow dimmer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush has come face to face with the limits of the
American presidency.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Senate dealt him a major energy policy defeat when it
thwarted his plan to drill for oil in the Arctic wilderness. He was
defied in the Middle East as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell returned
from a lengthy, much-touted mission unable to win a cease-fire between
Israelis and Palestinians. And the White House was caught in the
confusing backwash of an attempted coup in Venezuela, scrambling to
answer questions about whether it had been willing to support an
anti-democratic takeover.</LD>
<LD>   At home and far away, Bush was unable to bend politics and diplomacy
in his direction.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say this should come as no surprise. Seven months after the
Sept. 11 attacks that focused Bush's energies on launching the war on
terrorism, the last week signaled the return to a more normal period in
which his ability to command events is more constrained. And it forecast
new challenges for his administration.</TE>
<TE>Back to Persuasion, Compromise for Bush</TE>
<TE>   "We are back to a space in which Bush can't rely on people rallying to
him because of the war on terror, but he has to be persuasive on each of
these other issues on their own rights and on their own terms," said John
Podesta, White House chief of staff during the final years of the Clinton
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Podesta added: "He can't get up in the morning and expect he'll tell
everyone what he wants them to do and they'll salute."</TE>
<TE>   That means if Bush expects to end the year with a list of
accomplishments on such domestic concerns as energy and environmental
policy, the budget and the cost of prescription drugs, he likely would be
forced to delve into the nitty-gritty of persuasion and compromise.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has shown little inclination for this approach. "His
relations with Congress are marginal at best," said a veteran of
Republican administrations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   On some fronts, that has been obvious for some time. His efforts to
prod the Senate to speedily approve his judicial nominations have been
unsuccessful. And with Democrats in charge of the Senate and only a few
major issues on his legislative agenda, Bush may have a difficult time
turning to Congress to demonstrate momentum as November's midterm
elections approach.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Bush's poll rating--74% of those surveyed approved of his
performance in office, according to a poll last week by the Pew Research
Center for the People and the Press--hardly signals a presidency in
difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in good shape with the people, the bad week notwithstanding,"
said Andrew Kohut, the research group's director.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Bush took office after one of the most disputed elections
in U.S. history, Kohut added: "He went from a questioned president to a
very successful president and now he's a president who is hitting a
couple of bumps in the road. He's getting the full tour."</TE>
<TE>   The road will take the president on Monday to Lake Saranac, N.Y.,
where, marking Earth Day in the scenic Adirondack mountains, he will
promote his proposals to fight air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   A competing message is expected from Al Gore, Bush's opponent in the
2000 campaign. The former vice president, reemerging in the public arena,
will deliver what is being billed as a major speech on the environment
Monday at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush will travel to South Dakota for a speech on trade
policy and for a political fund-raising reception. On Thursday, he will
continue to grapple with the Middle East crisis, meeting with Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's schedule adheres to the pattern he has established since the
start of the year: Over the last 16 weeks, he has been out of Washington
for more than half of that time, not counting his weekends at Camp David,
and has picked up about $15 million in contributions for Republican
candidates and the party.</TE>
<TE>Mideast Peace May Rely on Bush's Inclusion</TE>
<TE>   Therein could lie some of the difficulties the Bush White House is
encountering, suggests former Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who
is on the faculty of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder if they're taking their eyes off the ball and have swung
into a campaign mode and have moved away from the issues on the Hill," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As reluctant as Bush was to get involved in the Middle East, Pryor
said, he clearly has no choice but to concentrate on the crisis,
especially now that Powell has returned from his trip without winning a
commitment to a cease-fire from Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon or
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big gamble, but I don't think Arafat and Sharon will meet each
other unless the president of the United States calls them together,"
Pryor said. "I think the president is going to have to convene these
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, Pryor said, "set a tone pretty early that this was not going to
be something he'd engage in. It did give both sides a reason to think
they could do some things and not be called on the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he now senses the reality of governing," Pryor said.</TE>

<HD>Nation's Meat Is Found Safer</HD>
<DH>Health: Tests of ground beef show less contamination for the fourth
straight year. But some fear Bush policies may reverse that trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For a fourth year in a row, the government is finding fewer germs
in ground beef and other types of meat. Consumer advocates say Bush
administration policies could reverse that trend.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 2.8% of ground beef tested positive for salmonella
bacteria, compared with 3.3% in 2000 and 6.4% in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Late last year, however, the administration abandoned a court battle
with the meat industry over the government's authority to close plants
that repeatedly flunk tests for salmonella. An appeals court ruled in
December that meat plants could not be required to meet the Agriculture
Department's limits for salmonella.</LD>
<TE>   The administration says it still has all the legal power needed to
enforce meat safety standards. Consumer advocates disagree, and if the
salmonella rates rise, they will point to the increase as proof they are
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Illness rates could go right back up as the Bush administration stops
enforcing USDA's limits on salmonella in meat and poultry," said Caroline
Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public
advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week reported
sharp drops in illnesses caused by six of seven major types of food-borne
bacteria from 1996 to 2001, including salmonella, E. coli and
campylobacter.</TE>
<TE>   Elsa Murano, the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for food
safety, says the administration is taking steps that should lower even
more the rates of meat contamination and human illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The department has assigned special staff to work with plants on
improving sanitation systems, and on Monday planned to announce new
requirements for beef-grinding plants.</TE>
<TE>   The facilities will be required to have at least one antimicrobial
treatment for beef--or else buy their beef from a slaughterhouse that
does. Most ground beef plants already meet the requirement, but a few do
not, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration . . . is going forward and putting some teeth
into food safety systems," Murano said.</TE>
<TE>   The department long has credited its bacteria tests for the drop in
salmonella levels on meat and poultry, but industry officials say the
decline is because of improvements they have made in plant sanitation
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We have enjoyed a substantial decline because there were indeed high
numbers" of salmonella before, said Rosemary Mucklow, executive director
of the National Meat Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department's salmonella rules set limits on how often
meat or poultry could test positive for salmonella. The meat industry
says the limits, which are based on average contamination rates in the
1990s, are not scientifically based. It is not known how much of the
bacteria it takes to make someone sick.</TE>
<TE>   But Carol Tucker Foreman, who oversaw the department's food safety
programs during the Carter administration, says the salmonella tests are
a good indication of whether packinghouses are putting out clean meat.</TE>
<TE>   The department at least should have asked Congress for a law
guaranteeing the power to close plants that continually exceed the
limits, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that the industry can't comply with [the
limits]," said Foreman, director of the Consumer Federation of America's
Food Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   More battles on food issues are looming.</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department has delayed rules proposed by the Clinton
administration that would require makers of hot dogs, cold cuts and other
ready-to-eat meat products to test plant equipment for Listeria
monocytogenes. The meat industry wants the rules rewritten.</TE>
<TE>   The department is doing a new analysis of the risk of listeria and the
benefits of the proposed rules, Murano said.</TE>
<TE>   On hold at the Food and Drug Administration are new rules for egg
farms that are intended to reduce the incidence of salmonella.</TE>
<TE>   The regulations were ready to be released to the public nearly a year
ago, agency officials said at the time. Now an FDA spokeswoman will say
only that the rules are "in the process of being developed."</TE>

<HD>Scientists Weigh In With Deductions on Anthrax Killer</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Their theories on the attacks range from a disgruntled
researcher to a covert government project gone awry to right-wing
extremists.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Microbiologists, like nature, abhor a vacuum, and in the absence of
an FBI arrest in last fall's anthrax attacks, some of the nation's top
scientists are offering their own theories.</LD>
<LD>   In memos making their way around the Internet and in hallway
conversations at professional conferences, leading scientists--many
fearful that an unsolved case will only encourage other
bioterrorists--are applying their deductive reasoning to the
anthrax-laced letters that killed five people and spread a new level of
fear about biological warfare.</LD>
<LD>   Their theories are full of intrigue: A disgruntled scientist. A covert
government project gone awry. An accomplice to the Sept. 11 hijackers who
stayed behind to mail the letters after their planes hit the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. Right-wing extremists stockpiling the deadly
material in anticipation of a visit from the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<TE>   "We all have our pet theories," said Jason Pate, a bioterrorism expert
at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. "But none seems to
fit the facts exactly."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has been working aggressively on the case, conducting
thousands of interviews and hundreds of lab tests in consultation with
some of the world's top scientific experts and in concert with the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists applaud the effort--crediting agents with catching on
quickly to the complexities of microbiology. But others, led by Barbara
Hatch Rosenberg of Purchase College, State University of New York, think
the FBI has been, as she put it, "dragging its feet."</TE>
<TE>   They are scornful of an FBI e-mail sent to 32,000 members of the
American Society for Microbiology in January--three months after the
attacks stopped--asking scientists for their help in locating the
culprit, possibly a loner with access to an American lab. They wonder why
the FBI outreach came so late, and so broadly, when the number of
scientists with expertise and access to anthrax materials is probably
closer to 200.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the FBI privately takes a dim view of the armchair
speculation. Mindful of their own mistakes in accusing scientist Wen Ho
Lee of spying in 1999 and Richard Jewell in the Atlanta Olympics bombing
in 1996, the FBI is eager to get this one right.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the scientists upset with the FBI are passionate
campaigners against the dangers of biological weapons. They have devoted
their careers to studying sarin gas, anthrax and chemical weapons--and
the cults and terrorists who might use them. They fear the anthrax killer
might turn into another Unabomber, a malcontent who for 17 years
intermittently used the U.S. mail to send bombs to academics and
executives he deemed enemies. Every day that passes without an arrest,
they think, sends a dangerous message to those who might consider using
bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "A taboo was broken here," warned Rosenberg, a molecular biologist and
professor of environmental science. "Someone else might think they could
get away with this too."</TE>
<TE>   Steven M. Block, professor of biological sciences and applied physics
at Stanford University, agreed that the stakes are bigger than catching
one culprit.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental question here is, are we victims of our own anthrax,
or our own expertise, or is this a further fallout from Al Qaeda?" he
said. "It's a critical question. This is the first biological warfare of
the 21st century, and our proper response to it--morally, politically and
in every other way--depends on our understanding which it is."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg began the scientific sleuthing in February when she posted
an article on the Web site of the Federation of American Scientists,
http://www.fas.org/bwc, for which she has directed a panel on bioweapons
for the last 10 years. In the article, she writes that the anthrax
discovered in the letters mailed to two U.S. senators was so refined that
it contained 1 trillion spores per gram, characteristic of the
"weaponized" anthrax made by U.S. defense labs.</TE>
<TE>   Given the technical expertise required to produce that kind of
anthrax, and the small universe of scientists with that knowledge,
Rosenberg estimates that perhaps fewer than 40 people could be suspects.</TE>
<TE>   She believes that the perpetrator is one of her own: a disgruntled
American scientist.</TE>
<TE>   "He must be angry at some biodefense agency," she writes. "He is
driven to demonstrate, in a spectacular way, his capabilities and the
government's inability to respond."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of her case is a conspiracy theory, a conviction that the
slowness of the investigation can be explained only by some big secret
that the government wants to keep hidden for as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "He is cocksure that he can get away with it," she writes of the
perpetrator. "Does he know something that he believes to be sufficiently
damaging to the United States to make him untouchable by the FBI?"</TE>
<TE>   The BBC cited Rosenberg in a news report this month suggesting that
there could have been a secret government program to test the
practicalities of sending anthrax through the mail. "Some very expert
field person might have been asked to investigate the consequences of
mailing anthrax and it would have been left to him to decide exactly how
to carry it out," she said. "The result might have been a project gone
badly awry if he decided to use it for his own purposes."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI fumes at any suggestion it would deliberately sit on evidence,
pointing out that it arrested one of its own, agent-turned-spy Robert
Philip Hanssen, as soon as it learned of his betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while not ruling out any theories, the FBI's own public profile
of the anthrax killer sounds a lot like Rosenberg's.</TE>
<TE>   In its e-mail January to microbiologists, the FBI asked them to be on
the lookout for a loner. "The perpetrator might be described as
'standoffish' and likely prefers to work in isolation as opposed to a
group/team setting. It is possible this person used off-hours in a
laboratory or [borrowed] equipment to produce the anthrax."</TE>
<TE>   But the evidence points in a different direction for two theorizing
medical professionals: Tara O'Toole and Thomas V. Inglesby of the Johns
Hopkins University Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing a medical case in Florida, in which one of the Sept. 11
hijackers sought treatment for a leg wound in June, O'Toole and Inglesby
concluded that the skin lesion might have been caused by anthrax. That
was the conclusion too of the attending physician, Christos Tsonas of
Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, but it was reached only after
reviewing his notes taken while treating Ahmed Ibrahim A. Al Haznawi for
what appeared to be a simple, if unusual, leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-page memo for the FBI, O'Toole and Inglesby said the anthrax
diagnosis was "the most probable and coherent interpretation of the data
available."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI says that there are no blood tests, cultures or pictures that
would help resolve the Florida case. While it does not rule out any
leads, the FBI leans toward the theory of a domestic terrorist. But
O'Toole argues that to believe that someone other than the hijackers and
their accomplices hatched the anthrax plot would be to accept a lot of
coincidences.</TE>
<TE>   Haznawi lived with other hijackers in Boca Raton, Fla., the same city
where the first anthrax victim worked. Exposure to anthrax can cause
black skin lesions like the one on Haznawi's leg. And Mohamed Atta,
another hijacker, visited Belle Glade State Municipal Airport, north of
Fort Lauderdale, to look at crop-dusting equipment, possibly as a
conveyance for biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   To analysts like Pate of the Monterey Institute, the improbability of
so many coincidences "makes your eyebrows go up."</TE>
<TE>   But Pate, manager of a terrorism task force at the institute's Center
for Nonproliferation Studies, has his own theory. He says American
right-wing extremists are plausible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-government cliques, wary of official agencies and with a
fascination for biological agents, tend to stockpile such weapons, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pate's theory could explain the targets of the anthrax letters--two
liberal Democratic senators (Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota
and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont) and the
news media (CBS, NBC and the New York Post)--all hated by the fringe
cults.</TE>
<TE>   Some question whether the armchair sleuths have more than cursory
knowledge of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Barbara Hatch Rosenberg and Tara O'Toole may both be
guilty of some degree of over-speculation," said one researcher who did
not want to offend his colleagues by being named.</TE>
<TE>   Still, given the similarities between the mind-set of scientists and
detectives, the urge to speculate may be irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Rosenberg thinks it's a disgruntled worker conspiracy. Drs.
O'Toole and Inglesby think it's Sept. 11 accomplices. I think it's some
right-wing extremists," Pate said. "But maybe it's a disgruntled
right-wing extremist scientist accomplice."</TE>

<HD>Track Said to Have a History of Problems</HD>
<DH>Accident: Investigators speculate that water drainage and sandy
soil may have led to the derailment in Florida that killed 4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>CRESCENT CITY, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Track in the area where Amtrak's Auto Train derailed Thursday had
experienced chronic problems with water drainage in the sandy Florida
soil, and investigators said Saturday they are looking at the possibility
that this contributed to the wreck that killed four passengers and
injured more than 160 others.</LD>
<LD>   George Black, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said investigators are concentrating on track problems as the probable
cause of the derailment rather than any problem with Amtrak's
locomotives, passenger cars or auto-carrying cars. He said investigators
had found "nothing remarkable" in inspections of the Amtrak equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators are also looking at track maintenance in the area, Black
said, as well as whether a coal train that passed over the same track six
minutes before the wreck might have helped push at least one rail out of
alignment.</LD>
<TE>   Black said it was clear that the two Amtrak engineers had almost no
time to react to what appears to have been a misalignment of the track as
the train rounded a curve. The engineer at the controls, who he described
as a "well-qualified" 35-year veteran, told investigators he saw the
misaligned track "just as it was about to go under the nose of the
engine."</TE>
<TE>   The relief engineer said he never saw the misalignment but felt a
violent shaking, as did the conductor who was three to four cars back on
the train. All three immediately reached for emergency air brake valves,
and Black said it is unclear which of the two engineers acted first.</TE>
<TE>   The two locomotives and the first two passenger cars remained on the
track despite the shaking, but the following 14 passenger cars and the
first seven of the 23 auto rack cars derailed. Seven of the passenger
cars turned over.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described the four people who died as vacationers and
"snowbirds" who were returning to their homes up north. They were
identified as Frank Alfredo, 68, of Waccabuc, N.Y.; Joan DiStefano, 65,
of Staten Island; and husband and wife Joseph and Marjorie Wright of
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve people remained hospitalized with broken bones and head
injuries; the most serious being a 73-year-old woman who was listed in
critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   At a briefing, and later in an interview today, Black said CSX
Transportation, which owns the tracks, had experienced drainage problems
at the wreck site. Even though the area is not swampy, a culvert runs
under the tracks and the sandy soil tends to become waterlogged.</TE>
<TE>   This leads to what railroaders call "pumping," in which each passing
train compresses the water into the subgrade below the track and pushes
out soil particles. Eventually a "soft spot" forms, and the track tends
to depress. Maintenance workers then must shore up the area with new
ballast and smooth the track. Black said CSX last worked on the track on
March 12, and it had been inspected repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   Black also said it appears that the track structure had been moving
under the weight of trains, with the bond between crossties, steel tie
plates and spikes getting loose.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like there was just a general instability in the area,"
Black said.</TE>
<TE>   The crew of a heavy southbound coal train, which passed over the track
six minutes before the northbound passenger train, noticed nothing
unusual, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he noted that the coal train was slowing down as it went
around the curve, preparing to go into a siding to meet the Auto Train.
Since the curve was superelevated, meaning that the rail on the inside of
the curve is lower than the outside rail, a slower moving train will put
more pressure on the inside rail than will a faster moving train. The
inside rail appears to have failed, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   The coal train engineer did not use the train's air brakes, which
apply brakes evenly throughout the train, he said. However, the engineer
did engage dynamic brakes, which use the engine to slow the train, like
downshifting a car. Since there is some slack in the couplers between
each car, investigators want to know whether the use of dynamic brakes,
which is now standard railroad practice, caused the slack throughout the
train to "run in" or compress, producing forces that could have further
pounded the rail.</TE>
<TE>   Black said investigators are impressed with how the double-deck
Superliner cars remained intact even though they were pounded with
massive forces. Unlike airliners, which are built of lightweight aluminum
and composite material, rail passenger cars are built of heavy steel.
This factor alone often prevents deaths or major injuries in even
high-speed train wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   "The good story is that the cars stood up like champs," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   The crash site became a sightseeing attraction Saturday afternoon as
older couples and young families quietly gathered to watch as workers
using heavy equipment moved the toppled cars. The site is in a wooded
area of live oaks draped in Spanish moss just outside the town limits of
Crescent City on U.S. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin and Betty Hawk of Satsuma, 14 miles north, were snapping
photographs of the silver cars lying askew. They said they had watched
television news reports of the derailment Thursday night and wanted to
see the damage for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "When I see this, I think it's a miracle that only four people were
killed," said Melvin Hawk, 72, a retired Chrysler Corp. employee
originally from Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got friends who travel like this all the time. They said it was
so convenient to have your car with you," said Betty Hawk. "But I hate to
think about even riding on a train right now--for a while anyway."</TE>

<HD>Irrigation District to Defy Order to Protect Salmon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Irrigation district officials say they will defy a court order
intended to protect endangered Chinook salmon and steelhead and begin
sending water to their members' fields next month.</LD>
<LD>   The Methow Valley Irrigation District in north-central Washington
state was ordered by a federal judge to improve the efficiency of its
irrigation system by April 1 or go without water. Federal attorneys asked
U.S. District Judge Fred Van Sickle on Thursday to carry out that order.</LD>
<LD>   The judge said he'll make a decision soon.</LD>
<TE>   The irrigation district, which covers 1,500 acres, plans to begin
sending water to its members on May 1. Mike Gage, director of the
irrigation district, said the district will switch on the irrigation
system even if a court ruling prohibits it.</TE>
<TE>   Methow Valley farmers contend the fish aren't endangered because those
spawned in hatcheries are plentiful and unprotected. The National Marine
Fisheries Service contends the hatchery fish are genetically distinct.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of [anglers] catch those very fish every year," Gage said.
"And yet, they're going to shut us down for killing fish."</TE>
<TE>   A state-commissioned study in 1990 concluded that for every eight
gallons the district draws from the Twisp River, one gallon was delivered
to fields. A more recent study shows a 2-1 ratio.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an issue of enough water," fisheries service spokesman
Brian Gorman said. "There's plenty of water for fish and farmers, if it's
used appropriately."</TE>

<HD>5.1 Quake Rattles Parts of New York State</HD>
<DH>Northeast: Gov. Pataki declares a state of emergency in two
counties. Tremors felt as far as Baltimore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUSABLE FORKS, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 shook the Northeast awake
early Saturday, collapsing roads in New York and rattling homes from
Maine to Maryland. No injuries were immediately reported.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. George Pataki declared states of emergency in Essex and Clinton
counties near the Vermont and Canada borders. No restrictions were placed
on travel, but police were urging drivers to use caution.</LD>
<LD>   The quake, centered 15 miles southwest of Plattsburgh, N.Y., left
cracks in foundations and chimneys throughout the region, said Ray
Thatcher, director of emergency services for Essex County.</LD>
<TE>   In the nearby hamlet of Jay, the earthquake caused an explosion that
disrupted a New York State Electric &amp; Gas substation, sending sparks into
the sky and cutting power to about 3,500 residents, Thatcher said. Power
was expected to be restored by late Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   William Ott, a seismologist at Weston Observatory at Boston College,
said at least two aftershocks were reported.</TE>
<TE>   He called the earthquake "moderate." A typical magnitude 5.1
earthquake would cause cracked plaster, broken windows and minor
structural damage around the epicenter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   State inspectors were sent to the Adirondacks to examine bridges and
dams for damage. The state Department of Environmental Conservation
inspected all the dams in the area and found no damage.</TE>
<TE>   The quake broke off a 100-foot section from one road in Ausable, said
David Fessette, Clinton County highway construction supervisor. A crew
was filling the area with limestone Saturday afternoon. Parts of at least
two other roads collapsed, and there were several water main breaks.</TE>
<TE>   At Adirondack Mountain Spirits in Ausable, the earthquake rattled
liquor bottles off the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a mess," said owner Dayle Richards. "Even if they didn't
break, they were covered with other debris."</TE>
<TE>   The largest quake recorded in New York, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey, was a 5.8 magnitude quake in 1944 that was centered in
Massena, about three miles from Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Won Young Kim, a seismologist at the Columbia University Lamont
Doherty Earth Observatory, said a 3.5 quake occurred in the same area on
April 20 two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Northern New York is an active area, but most of the earthquakes that
occur in the area are smaller," said Frank Revetta, a professor of
geology at State University of New York at Potsdam. "Normally you'd get
one this big just every 100 years or so.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last two or three years, there haven't been many at all,
and I wondered if that meant anything. This might prove the strained
energy had not been released, and now it has been."</TE>
<TE>   By several accounts, the shaking lasted about 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Slattery, of Yorktown Heights just north of New York City, said
she was in bed when the temblor struck.</TE>
<TE>   "I could hear the frame of the house shaking," Slattery said.</TE>
<TE>   Tremors also were felt in Canada, as far east as Boston and Portland,
Maine, and as far south as Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Carol McDonald of Downingtown, Pa., about 40 miles northwest of
Philadelphia, said she woke up to find the windows of her home rattling.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband grabbed their baby and waited out the tremors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from California and [said], 'This feels like an earthquake.' I
didn't think we got those out here."</TE>

<HD>Columbine Victims Remembered</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Three years after school massacre, the community is
still trying to move on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITTLETON, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>On the third anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre,
friends and relatives released balloons and erected crosses Saturday in
memory of the 13 victims.</LD>
<LD>   "I love you Dave" was written on the balloon Linda Sanders let go to
honor her husband, the teacher who died of wounds suffered while trying
to rescue students during the attack on April 20, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just shaking, remembering that morning, and I just want everybody
to kiss their sons, daughters, loved ones goodbye, every morning," she
said.</LD>
<TE>   The anniversary drew hundreds to a memorial service at Clement Park,
next to the school.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we are a stronger community, but a community that is
still healing," said Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis. "Even though
the scars will remain with us forever, we will continue to heal."</TE>
<TE>   Before the service began, Valerie Haile carried a cross dedicated to
her friend, slain student Rachel Scott.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying not to focus exactly on what happened that day but
remembering everybody that's gone," Haile said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen crosses, one for each victim, were erected.</TE>
<TE>   Haile did not attend Columbine, but she performed in a play with Scott
two weeks before the teenager was killed with 11 other students and Dave
Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   She said it was the first memorial service she had attended since the
massacre committed by teen gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who
committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The sky was gray and temperatures were in the 40s as mourners trickled
into the park all morning under the watch of light security.</TE>
<TE>   Shanda McKown and her teenage daughters, Amber and Brittany, placed a
flowered blanket on the ground and bowed their heads in prayer half an
hour before the service started.</TE>
<TE>   On a nearby hill above the school, parent Steve Schweitzberger
scratched the words "never forgotten" into the cold dirt. His daughter,
Sara, survived the attack and will graduate this year.</TE>
<TE>   He said Columbine must be known for its recovery as much as for the
tragedy itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We're moving forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some scars were reopened last week with the release of a report
concluding that victim Daniel Rohrbough was shot by Eric Harris.
Rohrbough's parents had believed he was accidentally killed by a Denver
police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The report did not settle two questions: why police had not arrested
Harris and Klebold when threats they made against other students were
reported, and whether SWAT teams were too slow to react. A lawsuit has
been filed on behalf of Sanders' family, claiming he would have survived
if SWAT members hadn't waited several hours to enter the school.</TE>

<HD>South Africa Seeks Return of Detainee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>South African officials are seeking the return of a former flight
student who was detained on immigration charges after his name was found
on a document in a cave in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Issaya Nombo, 44, was arrested Monday by federal officials in North
Carolina and was being held for overstaying his visa after finishing a
pilot training course in Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials have said they had no evidence to suggest Nombo was
involved in terrorist activity. It's possible terrorists had been
searching the Internet for flight school graduates of certain ethnicities
for recruiting, according to the FBI.</LD>
<TE>   South African embassy spokesman Vicky Maharaj said Friday that he
didn't know whether South Africa would try to extradite Nombo or would
wait for the United States to deport him.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a process that will start, depending upon the charges
back in South Africa," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department declined to discuss the case Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nombo had been convicted of fraud in South Africa in March 2001 for
buying pilot exams before taking a test to qualify as an airline captain.</TE>
<TE>   SA Airways hired him as a relief pilot on 747 jetliners in February
2000 but suspended him about a month later. He was convicted after
fleeing the country, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Survives in Girl Who Received Bone Marrow</HD>
<DH>Altruism: New Yorker's decision to donate saved a Nevada child.
Nine years later, he died at the World Trade Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HENDERSON, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>Chantyl Peterson bursts through the front door, greets her mother
and slings her schoolbooks onto the floor. She's a healthy seventh-grader
who loves horseback riding and playing the flute and doesn't mind
homework.</LD>
<LD>   Nine years ago, she was dying.</LD>
<LD>   A New York City firefighter saved her life back then, but not in the
usual way. His bone marrow was a perfect match for the little Nevada
girl, then 5 and badly needing a transplant.</LD>
<TE>   During a 45-minute procedure in Milwaukee, his marrow was sent into
Chantyl intravenously. It turned her type AB blood into his A positive
blood, and she quickly recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Chantyl drew a picture for the donor whose name she still
didn't know. It showed a little girl being rescued. "For my friend, Mr.
Nice Man. Mr. Nice Man is saving Chantyl from a fire," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she learned his name, Terry Farrell, and they exchanged
phone calls and letters. Chantyl and her family met with Farrell on
visits to Manhattan. They took the fireboat around New York Harbor and
ate lunch in the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Chantyl, now 13, traveled to New York to be with Farrell
for a final time.</TE>
<TE>   She read a prayer at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   He had died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks--like so many other
firefighters trying again to save someone's life.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother had always thought Chantyl looked pale. There were
nosebleeds and constant bruises. She was only 3 when she was diagnosed
with aplastic anemia, a disease that stops the function of bone marrow.
Only a transplant could cure her.</TE>
<TE>   But her parents weren't a match for Chantyl. Neither was her brother,
nor her sister. Chantyl needed marrow from a stranger.</TE>
<TE>   Her name was put into the National Marrow Donor Program registry, the
world's largest, with 4.5 million volunteer donors.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors told her family that Chantyl had a 1 in 20,000 chance of
finding a match.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us it might not happen," says Chantyl's mother, Sheri.</TE>
<TE>   But there was hope.</TE>
<TE>   One of those who signed up as a donor was a 45-year-old married father
of two from Huntington, N.Y., a firefighter with Rescue Company 4. Terry
Farrell hadn't made anything of it; he never even told his five brothers
he had volunteered to donate.</TE>
<TE>   Of five possible matches for Chantyl, he turned out to be No. 1. "They
told us they had a perfect match," Sheri Peterson recalls. Farrell went
for additional testing required for the transplant.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, an experimental drug seemed to help Chantyl. But when she
was 5 a biopsy revealed a mass in her chest. It was T-cell lymphoma, and
a bone marrow transplant was the only option.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Peterson worried the donor might not be available or might have
second thoughts about undergoing the uncomfortable 90-minute procedure in
which a needle is inserted into the hip. But Farrell quickly agreed.</TE>
<TE>   A nurse showed Chantyl a jigsaw puzzle map of the United States and
pointed to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Your donor lives right over in here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell went to a New York hospital so his marrow could be collected
and flown to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, where the
transplant procedure was carried out on July 10, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The following month, Chantyl left the hospital, a healthy little girl.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter, she thanked her donor for his "tough" blood.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell wrote back to his "little lady."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want you to become too tough with my blood," he wrote in a
Sept. 22, 1993, letter.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember you are still a beautiful little girl. My small contribution
to you is only half the battle; the other half is yours. I know you are a
fighter just by your letter alone."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Farrell said his brother Terry was always quiet and unassuming,
and treated the marrow donation the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talked to him about it afterward, I got a grin out of him,"
Kevin says. "If you got a grunt out of him, it was a long conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Chantyl wore a new, pink frilly dress in honor of their first meeting,
in 1994. Farrell wore his uniform. She rode in his firetruck, and the two
families went on a picnic and made brownies together at Farrell's home.</TE>
<TE>   Another day, Chantyl's mother took pictures as the 6-year-old ate
lunch with Farrell on the 87th floor of the World Trade Center in the
office of one of his friends, by a window overlooking the city.</TE>
<TE>   They stayed in touch--once, she wrote to Farrell about Fire Prevention
Week at school and how she had learned how to stop, drop and roll--and
five years after their first meeting, Chantyl and her family returned for
a surprise visit in September 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Peterson says, "I just remember hugging him, saying, 'We'll see
you in another five years.' "</TE>
<TE>   But then came Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chantyl was in her bedroom but heard her mother on the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "She came out of the room and said, 'Is Terry in trouble? Does he need
my help? Do I need to give him some blood?' "</TE>
<TE>   "I told her we really need to pray for him," her mother replied.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell's body was found Oct. 25 in the rubble of the trade center's
south tower.</TE>
<TE>   The Peterson family flew to New York a third time, this time to say
goodbye. Chantyl recited part of the closing prayer at the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   A New York-based donor program organized by a fellow firefighter will
be re-christened to include Farrell's name.</TE>

<HD>Scholar West Downplays Harvard Dispute</HD>
<DH>Education: He says the university's president was mainly
responsible for his departure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MAHWAH, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Harvard University scholar Cornel West said the school's president
was largely responsible for his move to Princeton but that too much has
been made of their dispute.</LD>
<LD>   After giving a lecture Saturday at Ramapo College, West spoke to
reporters about "the push of Harvard and pull of Princeton"--and said
Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers was the push. But he said Harvard's
tradition is bigger than any one faculty member or disagreement.</LD>
<LD>   "Thirty years from now, when we're dead and gone, Harvard will still
be there," West said. "I'm leaving Harvard with a tear, arriving at
Princeton with a smile."</LD>
<TE>   Summers reportedly rebuked West for recording a spoken-word CD and
leading a political committee for the Rev. Al Sharpton's possible
presidential campaign and not focusing enough on scholarship. He also
reportedly accused West of allowing grade inflation in his introductory
black studies course.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Harvard's African American studies department have also said
Summers did not make a strong statement in support of affirmative action
after taking over his post last year.</TE>
<TE>   West, a distinguished professor in the department, spoke about the
possibility of department head Henry Louis Gates Jr. following him to
Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," West said. "He's leaning in that direction, but you
have to let him speak for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Gates has said he will make a decision this summer.</TE>
<TE>   West said he was excited about the recent expansion of Princeton's
African American studies program, which he led until 1994. He starts at
Princeton in July.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people attended West's lecture Saturday, a discussion on
black intellectualism.</TE>
<TE>   West said the Sept. 11 attacks united all of the nation's factions for
the first time in history because Americans from all walks of life found
themselves the focus of arbitrary violence.</TE>
<TE>   West gained prominence with his 1993 book, "Race Matters," and has
also worked on such projects as the Million Man March, confabs on hip-hop
music and national youth gang summits.</TE>
<TE>   He was the second to leave Harvard's black studies department this
year. K. Anthony Appiah accepted an offer from Princeton in January,
citing personal reasons.</TE>

<DL>GREENSBURG, Pa.
</DL>
<LD>A teenager was charged Saturday with bludgeoning his older brother
to death with a hammer, and another youth was also in custody in
connection with the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Ian Bishop, 14, was being held without bail on adult charges of
criminal homicide and aggravated assault, according to state police in
Greensburg, about 25 miles east of Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Bishop had called a friend Friday afternoon, and the
friend's mother then drove to Bishop's home in Hempfield, where she found
his 18-year-old brother, Adam, with severe head wounds. He died at a
Pittsburgh hospital that night.</LD>
<TE>   "The boy's mother saw what happened, and she was the one who called
911," state police Lt. Robert Weaver said. He didn't elaborate on what
the friend's mother overheard or was told.</TE>
<TE>   Zack Rollins, a neighbor and friend of both brothers, said he was
shocked to hear police had arrested the 14-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know of anything wrong going between him and his brother,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Cardinal Expresses Regrets in Letter</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Edward M. Egan wrote parishioners, saying mistakes were
made in responses to sexual abuse claims.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic Cardinal Edward M. Egan wrote in a letter to
parishioners Saturday that he apologizes "if, in hindsight," he made any
mistakes in handling sex abuse allegations against priests.</LD>
<LD>   Egan, who has been criticized for his handling of sexual abuse
allegations against priests when he was bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.,
stopped short of saying directly that he had made mistakes.</LD>
<LD>   "It is clear that today we have a much better understanding of this
problem. If, in hindsight, we also discover that mistakes may have been
made as regards prompt removal of priests and assistance to victims, I am
deeply sorry," he wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Egan has consistently defended his actions and those of the Bridgeport
diocese in handling those cases. The letter is the furthest he has gone
in acknowledging that mistakes may have been made.</TE>
<TE>   "I consistently sought and acted upon the best independent advice
available to me from medical experts and behavioral scientists," Egan
wrote in the letter, which was to be read at weekend Masses in the New
York Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Sealed court records obtained by The Hartford Courant indicate that
while Egan was in Bridgeport, he didn't notify authorities of abuse
allegations against priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Courant and the Connecticut Post have reported that documents show
Egan allowed several priests facing such allegations to continue working.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, Egan added: "I will do everything in my power to
ensure, as much as is humanly possible, that such abuse by clergy will
never happen again. You should expect nothing less of me, and the leaders
of our church."</TE>
<TE>   Egan is scheduled to leave for Rome today to attend a meeting of U.S.
cardinals that was called by Pope John Paul II to address the sex abuse
scandal that has surrounded the church in America this year.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the New York Archdiocese gave the Manhattan
district attorney's office information on sex abuse allegations against
priests over the last 35 years. It also has suspended six priests accused
of sexual misconduct with minors.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese serves 2.4 million Catholics in parts of New York City
and its northern suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   In developments elsewhere:</TE>
<TE>   * Bishop Donald Wuerl of the Diocese of Pittsburgh said American
bishops did not realize the full nature of the priest sex scandal over
the past decades and viewed pedophilia as a moral failure.</TE>
<TE>   "Bishops did not understand the gravity of what we were dealing with,"
Wuerl said during a taping of a local television program. Wuerl has
removed several priests from active ministry because of allegations of
sexual misconduct; none has been charged with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   * The First Presbyterian Church of Ann Arbor, Mich., sent a letter to
its members explaining that it forced a choir director to retire in 1994
following sexual abuse allegations by a former church member.</TE>
<TE>   The former choir director, Donald T. Bryant, 83, has not been charged
and denies the allegations. He worked at the church from 1970 to 1994 and
was director of the University of Michigan Musical Society's Choral
Union.</TE>
<TE>   * A former altar boy sued the Archdiocese of Louisville, Ky., alleging
that a recently retired priest had sexually abused him in the 1970s. The
priest, the Rev. Louis E. Miller, retired in March after allegations he
abused minors in the 1960s and 1970s. Miller, not named as a defendant in
the lawsuit, denied abusing children.</TE>
<TE>   * The eight U.S. cardinals meeting with the pope this week to discuss
the church's sex abuse scandal are to gather in Philadelphia Friday for
the annual American Cardinals Dinner, a $1,000-per-person benefit for
Catholic University scholarships.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins are slowly showing the Cleveland Indians they can
play with them.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Kinney pitched into the seventh inning in his first
appearance in a year, and the Twins sent the Indians to their fifth
consecutive loss, 6-2, Saturday night at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   Doug Mientkiewicz and Torii Hunter hit solo homers for the Twins,
who have won the first two games of the three-game series.</LD>
<TE>   After Cleveland won 14 of 19 between the teams last season and
swept a four-game series from the Twins last week, has the momentum
shifted to Minnesota?</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," Doug Mientkiewicz said. "We can't expect to come out
tomorrow and throw our hats out and expect to win. Yes, we're happy
we took the series, but we're not going to let down against them."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, New York 4--Eric Hinske hit his first career home run
in the 10th inning and the Blue Jays survived a stunning collapse to
defeat the Yankees at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Down to their last strike with no one on base, the Yankees rallied
for three runs in the ninth off closer Kelvim Escobar to tie it at
4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Plesac (1-1) struck out a swinging Jason Giambi with the bases
loaded to force extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Texas 2--Dan Miceli walked Jeff Cirillo with the bases
loaded and two outs in the 11th inning as the Mariners staged another
dramatic comeback to defeat the Rangers at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   It was Seattle's ninth comeback victory of the season, and it came
a night after the Mariners lost 9-0 to end a 10-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Guillen scored the winning run after Miceli walked Cirillo
on a 3-1 pitch. Guillen hit a double off the left-field wall with one
out in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 12, Detroit 5--Paul Konerko hit a grand slam and for the
second time this week matched his career high with five RBIs to lead
the White Sox at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Thomas hit a two-run homer and reached base five times for
the White Sox, who have won nine of 11. Magglio Ordonez had three
hits, including a solo shot, and Jose Valentin also homered. Konerko
leads the AL with 21 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Tampa Bay 3--Jason Johnson gave up three runs and six
hits over seven innings in ending his losing streak over two seasons
at nine games as the Orioles won at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (1-3) faced the minimum over his final 32/3 innings and
earned his first victory since Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Boston at Kansas City, ppd.--The Red Sox and Royals were rained
out at Kansas City, Mo., and will make up the game today as part of a

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Erstad Likely to Sit for Rest of Trip</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Outfielder Darin Erstad, diagnosed late Friday with a mild
concussion, was released from an Oakland hospital Saturday afternoon
after an overnight stay for observation.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad left Friday's game after his chin slammed against the
ground as he dove for a fly ball. After appearing disoriented during
a clubhouse examination, he was hospitalized for tests, including an
X-ray and CT scan Friday and an MRI exam Saturday. The
tests--intended to rule out any neck injury, skull fracture or
bleeding in the brain--all were normal, Angel athletic trainer Ned
Bergert said.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors are expected to decide today whether to send Erstad back
to Southern California for further examination, Bergert said. In any
case, it is unlikely that Erstad would play during the remaining four
games of this trip. Doctors will not clear him until he has been free
of symptoms, most notably headaches, for several days.</LD>
<TE>   The diagnosis, Bergert said, could represent a residual effect
from Tuesday's game, in which Erstad crashed face first into the
outfield fence. Doctors examined Erstad on Wednesday and found no
symptoms consistent with a concussion, Bergert said, and so they did
not order follow-up tests. Erstad played Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia and closer Troy Percival headed a
small delegation that visited Erstad in the hospital Friday night.
Scioscia stayed until 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I left, he was coming around," Scioscia said. "His
biggest complaint was that he had a headache and he was tired."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad was sleeping soundly when Percival returned to visit
Saturday morning. Percival made sure he would not have to recuperate
on hospital food alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought him some food," Percival said. "I let him sleep and I
took a cab over here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scratched Brad Fullmer from Saturday's lineup because
of a bruised left thumb. Fullmer injured the thumb while diving
headfirst into first base Friday. He finished the game, but the thumb
swelled considerably after the game. The Angels sent Fullmer for
X-rays, which ruled out any broken bones, and he said he hoped to
play today.</TE>
<TE>   The unavailability of Erstad and Fullmer left Scioscia with a
two-man bench Saturday. Scioscia said the Angels would await further
word on when Erstad might return before deciding whether to call up
another position player, most likely Clay Bellinger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff DaVanon has started two games in right field for the
struggling Tim Salmon, and he started in center field Saturday for
Erstad. DaVanon hit .313 at triple-A Salt Lake last season, but he
hit .193 in 88 at-bats with the Angels. At 28, he is well aware this
might be his best, and last, opportunity to establish himself as
anything more than a team's fourth or fifth outfielder on the major
league level.</TE>
<TE>   "In the minor leagues, I put up numbers when I was an everyday
player," he said. "They're giving me a shot, so I'll try to do the
best I can. I'm not going to try to hit a home run every time up like
I did last year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus is so strong that he homered on a pitch he thought he
had popped up. He was so convinced that he flipped his bat in
frustration as he ran toward first base.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what it's like to pop up," he said, "and I thought that
was a pop up. It must have been the wind or something."</TE>

<HD>Angels Accept Blame After 8-7 Loss to A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels passed the blame for their latest loss around the
clubhouse. Al Levine took his fair share of the blame. So did Scott
Spiezio and Kevin Appier.</LD>
<LD>   No one was blaming Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, whose adherence to
strict bullpen roles meant that his team forfeited potential matchup
advantages in the eighth inning Saturday. The Oakland Athletics
scored twice off Levine in the eighth, thanks in part to an error by
Spiezio, and what could have been an exhilarating comeback victory
for the Angels collapsed into a demoralizing 8-7 defeat at Network
Associates Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Appier spotted the A's a 6-0 lead in the third inning, but the
Angels roared back to take a 7-6 lead after six innings. With
Scioscia most comfortable using Levine in the eighth and closer Troy
Percival the ninth, the Angels asked Dennis Cook to get two outs in
the seventh inning and then asked Levine to hold the lead for
Percival. Cook did, Levine did not, and Percival never made it into
the game.</LD>
<TE>   "I bleeping stunk," Levine said. "I had the lead and lost it. I
stunk. I'm not afraid to admit it."</TE>
<TE>   With nine outs needed to preserve a 7-6 lead, the Angels summoned
Cook. The left-hander retired the only two batters he faced, both
left-handers. Then Scioscia opted for the right-handed Levine against
a powerful right-handed hitter, Miguel Tejada, and Levine got the
out.</TE>
<TE>   Levine returned for the eighth inning, in his role as Percival's
set-up man. But the first four Oakland hitters that inning were
left-handed, and the A's would likely have used a pinch-hitter for
only one. By using Levine against Tejada, Scioscia lost his chance to
keep his last available left-hander in the game against the ensuing
quartet of Oakland left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at Tejada as the tying run, and we wanted to make
sure we had the best chance to shut him down," Scioscia said. "Al's
the guy we wanted to get us out of the seventh. We weren't really
worrying too much about the eighth."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cook: "Al is the set-up guy. That's the way you try to plan
it, to get to Al and Percy. I think it was a good move."</TE>
<TE>   The move backfired, in part because Levine had little feel for the
strike zone. He threw three balls to Terrence Long, the first batter
in the eighth, then struck him out. He walked Greg Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Pena then grounded to Spiezio. The first baseman made a
nice stop, but his throw to second base pulled shortstop David
Eckstein off the bag for an error.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a bit greedy and tried to force the double play when it may
not have been there," Spiezio said. "Eck made a good play just to
[catch] it."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Giambi walked, loading the bases. Frank Menechino tied the
score with a sacrifice fly. Levine threw three balls to Scott
Hatteberg, then was nearly beheaded by a line drive, a single that
drove home the winning run. Levine then walked David Justice before
getting the final out.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio's error meant the runs were unearned. But, after giving up
three walks and a hit within the span of five batters, Levine wasn't
about to point the finger at Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether the play is made or not, I have a job to do," Levine
said. "My job is to get three outs and not let them score."</TE>
<TE>   Said Spiezio: "If I would have made that play, I would have put
the team and Al in a lot better position. I'll take the blame for
that, definitely."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia wasn't blaming Levine.</TE>
<TE>   "Al wasn't as fine as I've seen him," Scioscia said, "but, if we
make a play defensively, we're out of the inning."</TE>
<TE>   Appier pitched 22/3 innings, the shortest outing by an Angel
starter this season. He shut out the A's in the first two innings,
then gave up six runs in the third and did not survive the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really had any command," Appier said. "I got away with it
in the first two innings. In the third, it caught up to me."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Lukasiewicz, Lou Pote and Cook held the A's at bay while the
Angels rallied on a home run and an RBI double from Troy Glaus, a
two-run double from Tim Salmon and RBI singles from Garret Anderson
and Jose Nieves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to give up too many leads," Scioscia said. "Al
will hold pretty much anything he has to. This was just one that got
away."</TE>

Central rivals, would each seem to have enough to worry about.</LD>
<LD>   The Astros had to put 16-game winner Wade Miller on the disabled
list, and the two rookies on the left side of their
infield--shortstop Adam Everett and third baseman Morgan Ensberg--are
struggling at the plate.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals, who opened the season deep in pitching, now must
deal with the retirement of struggling veteran Andy Benes, the muscle
injury that has sidelined Woody Williams for a month, the back spasms
that forced Garrett Stephenson onto the disabled list and the absence
of Rick Ankiel, who continues to wrestle with control and elbow
problems in the minors. In addition, Tino Martinez, replacing Mark
McGwire, began the weekend with one extra-base hit and is still
looking to score his first run.</LD>
<TE>   All of that, however, has been almost secondary to the little soap
opera the Astros and Cardinals have been caught up in, over who won
what last year.</TE>
<TE>   Seems the Astros are upset that a banner in the home bullpen at
Busch Stadium proclaims the Cardinals as co-champions of the Central
last year. One Astro was so upset about it that he called the press
box to complain during last week's first series between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   It will be recalled that they finished 2001 tied at 93-69.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros, after defeating the Cardinals in the final
regular-season game and winning the season series, 9-7, moved on as
division champions, relegating the Cardinals to the wild-card slot in
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Not only were the Astros offended by the banner, but they defaced
the cover of a St. Louis media guide and circulated it through their
clubhouse with the words, "2001 N.L. Central Co-Champions" changed to
"Wild Card."</TE>
<TE>   Said Houston General Manager Jerry Hunsicker, obviously taking the
matter seriously, "When we saw the Cardinals' media guide, we kind of
scratched our heads. We were awarded the division championship and
they were awarded the wild card. That's what we were told."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis General Manager Walt Jocketty couldn't believe what he
was hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," he said. "I would think they have more
significant concerns than something trivial like that."</TE>
<TE>   Added Manager Tony La Russa, "Ridiculous. If you want to be
champions outright, then win one more game. I hope they get
distracted by that all season."</TE>
<TE>   Well, boys will be boys. Or as major league official Katy Feeney
said, "If the Astros and Cardinals keep going on like this, we'll
take it away from both of them."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Burning</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just that the Braves lost four of six games to their NL
East rival New York Mets in their first engagements of the unbalanced
2002 schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it that they were 7-9 going into a weekend series with the
Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it's still early, as the slow starters like to say, and
that's what is bothering Tom Glavine. That and the back spasms that
have restricted Greg Maddux to only 12 innings, and the team's .196
batting average with runners in scoring position, and the 17 errors
in 17 games, seven by shortstop Rafael Furcal and four by second
baseman Marcus Giles.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just be concerned about the standings," Glavine said.
"We have to be concerned about how we're playing. We're not doing the
things a good ballclub has to do and we should be better than last
year. We obviously have high expectations and, so far, we haven't met
any of those. That's a very frustrating situation. I hate to think
everybody is going to sit here and say, 'Aw, well, it's early.' So
what? Do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Road Warriors</TE>
<TE>   So, the Seattle Mariners wouldn't be able to repeat their 20-4
start and 116 wins of last season. So, they wouldn't be able to
duplicate their American League-record 59 road victories of last
year. Well, with their 14-4 record and 10-0 road sweep, all bets are
off.</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Lou Piniella, explaining his team's road success:
"First of all, we have good players who are that much more confident
of their ability after last year and that much more convinced that
good things happen when you play as a team. Secondly, the conditions
and the dimensions at Safeco Field force us to play a fundamental
game that carries over to the road. And thirdly, some of the balls we
hit into the gaps or are caught on the warning track at home, carry
over the fence on the road."</TE>
<TE>   Turned Off</TE>
<TE>   If the development of young pitchers Bartolo Colon, C.C. Sabathia,
Danys Baez and Ryan Drese has helped compensate for the loss of
Roberto Alomar, Juan Gonzalez and Kenny Lofton, enabling the
Cleveland Indians to get off to a strong start in the AL Central,
veteran reliever Paul Shuey also thinks there's less of the star
element in the clubhouse and better chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not as much 'Me, me, me, I, I, I,' this year," he said.
"It's a much better atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Part of that improved atmosphere, he added, is the lack of music
in the clubhouse. There is no stereo blasting so loud no one can
talk, no one like Lofton fighting over the controls.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we've got 25 guys trying to reach the same goal every
day, instead of worrying about what music they're going to play in
the clubhouse," Shuey said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that three-game sweep by the division rival Chicago
White Sox ending Thursday night might prompt the Indians to
reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Storm</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kerrigan, Phil Garner and Davey Lopes have walked the
managerial plank since the start of spring training. Are Kansas
City's Tony Muser and Colorado's Buddy Bell next? And if managers are
hired to be fired, what about the people who hired them in the first
place?</TE>

<HD>Little Sympathy for the Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take Chuck Finley's filing for divorce to prove again that
there is little love in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the Texas Rangers, whose estrangement from the rest of
the baseball community is based on several grounds, among them:</LD>
<LD>   * Last year's industry-infuriating signing of Alex Rodriguez for
$252 million.</LD>
<TE>   * The flouting of rules, resulting, most notably, in a fine of
about $500,000 for tampering in the hiring of General Manager John
Hart and his assistant, Grady Fuson.</TE>
<TE>   * The acquisition of more suspect characters than any road gang,
among them Carl Everett, John Rocker, Hideki Irabu, Dan Miceli and
Ruben Rivera. Hart reminded a caller, however, that some of his
championship Cleveland teams featured the inimitable Albert Belle,
Manny Ramirez, Jose Mesa and Kenny Lofton.</TE>
<TE>   "We had clubs in Cleveland that would make this one look like a
Boy Scout troop," he said from Texas.</TE>
<TE>   With all of this, it's no wonder there's little sympathy for the
injury-wracked Rangers, who keep getting their Lone Star handed to
them. They have lost 12 of their first 17 games against American
League West rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is there sympathy?" asked Hart. "That's just the way it is
in baseball. I don't think people look on us as a marked team."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but the Rangers certainly haven't engendered much
affection.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of his hiring Nov. 1, Hart spared little cash or
effort trying to "prop up" a team that finished last in the West for
two consecutive seasons and a pitching staff that had the league's
worst earned-run average last year. The payroll went to $105.3
million, baseball's third highest, but the 2002 Rangers seem to
resemble the 2001 Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Hart, however, cited an injury wave that hit the Rangers like "a
perfect storm" in late spring, forcing them to open the season with a
virtually unprecedented 13 pitchers after taking 34 to camp.</TE>
<TE>   The disabled list is so congested, and Hart has brought in so many
journeymen pitchers, that he may next activate Orel Hershiser, the
team's associate general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Hershiser politely declined an interview request because he
doesn't want his front-office apprenticeship to seem bigger than it
is, but at 43, he said laughing, he has served his active duty and
isn't the answer to what Hart calls "a real injury mess."</TE>
<TE>   "Am I disappointed with our record? Absolutely," Hart said. "We
just haven't been able to overcome the inconsistent bullpen. I don't
think any club could prepare [for] or overcome the number of injuries
to key players, especially a club that doesn't have tremendous depth,
like ours."</TE>
<TE>   A bullpen that is two for nine in save opportunities and has blown
nine leads in the seventh inning or later--"It stinks, it's
demoralizing," Rodriguez said in Anaheim Tuesday night--remains
without closer Jeff Zimmerman, setup man Jay Powell and situational
left-hander Rich Rodriguez. In addition, Hart's two biggest
free-agent acquisitions, rotation ace Chan Ho Park and cleanup hitter
Juan Gonzalez, are on the disabled list, and catcher Ivan Rodriguez
will join them because of a herniated disk in his lower back.</TE>
<TE>   The closer void has been particularly costly.</TE>
<TE>   Hart gave Rocker another chance, as he had in Cleveland last year
after obtaining the controversial southpaw in a trade with the fed-up
Atlanta Braves, but Rocker failed again, blowing two of three save
chances and compiling an ERA of 9.53. He was optioned to triple A on
Wednesday and is deciding whether he will report. He has a split
contract that pays him $625,000 in the minors, compared to $2.5
million in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Said a Texas executive: "John still has terrific talent but
doesn't understand the commitment required at this level and still
allows his frustrations to result in anger. It's part maturity, part
never really learning how to pitch when he could throw 97 and 98 mph.
Now he throws 93, 94. It would be good enough if he had a breaking
ball to go with it, but he has no consistency with a slider, or any
other breaking pitch."</TE>
<TE>   So, the closer role now has been given to Irabu, who was
dispatched by the New York Yankees with George Steinbrenner's label
of "a fat toad" and who sacrificed his opportunity with the Montreal
Expos by drinking himself into a stupor before a rehabilitation start
at triple A.</TE>
<TE>   Still potent on offense, the Rangers are so hungry for bullpen
reliability that after Irabu had saved Wednesday's 4-1 victory over
the Angels, first baseman Rafael Palmeiro said that with Rocker, "You
never knew what was going to happen [but by taking charge,] Hideki
can change the whole attitude of the team. He's confident, and we
feel he can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   If it's a strange cast, Hart suggested he had little choice.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he had to stabilize the poor pitching of last year,
improve the middle of the batting order and respond to the spring
injuries. All of the moves, however, forced him to sacrifice two key
pitching prospects, Andy Pratt and Juan Moreno, in trades, and he has
been criticized by Texas media for reneging on a promise not to cut
into the club's future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're committed to the future but this is a different situation
from what we inherited in Cleveland [where he built a division
dynasty from scratch], " Hart said. "With the Indians, there was no
short-term hope at all. Given the owners' commitment here, the
financial investment, the nucleus of star players, I don't think this
club was geared up to wait five years."</TE>
<TE>   At that, Hart conceded, he doesn't expect to close the 43-game gap
of last year and replace the Seattle Mariners as division champions.</TE>
<TE>   "They won 116 games and haven't taken a step back," he said. "I
felt coming in that it was unrealistic to think we could run them
down, but if we could keep them in our headlights by being more
competitive, it would be a big accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   The sputtering Rangers face a long road, but maybe it's wrong to
suggest they are totally unloved. A-Rod broke hearts last week when
he revealed that he planned to marry his longtime girlfriend, Cynthia
Scurtis, in November.</TE>

<HD>Catcher Rodriguez Is Going on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas Ranger catcher Ivan Rodriguez has a herniated disk in his lower
back and will sit out four to six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, who did not make the team's trip to Seattle, had an MRI
test Friday at Arlington, Texas, and the results were announced
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers will put the 10-time American League All-Star on the
15-day disabled list after they return home, probably Monday or
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez was out of the lineup for the fifth consecutive game and
received treatment at Arlington. He was scratched from the lineup
April 15 because of lower back pain.</TE>
<TE>   Backup Bill Haselman is catching in Rodriguez's place. Rodriguez
is batting .222 (10 for 45) in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts," Texas first baseman Rafael Palmeiro said. "He is one
of the best players in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's injury is the latest in a rash of injuries to hit the
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers have put outfielder Juan Gonzalez and No. 1 starter
Chan Ho Park on the disabled list. Closer Jeff Zimmerman and reliever
Jay Powell are also out with injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jerry Narron said he has never seen so many injuries to
key players at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jose Rijo thought it was a joke when Cincinnati Red Manager Bob
Boone told him he's getting his first start since July 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Five elbow surgeries and nearly seven years after his last start,
Rijo will start today against the Chicago Cubs, completing one of the
most amazing comebacks in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than this," Rijo said. "I didn't think
I'd get the chance to be starting again, to be what I was before. I
thought it would be impossible."</TE>
<TE>   He has a 2.25 earned-run average in four appearances, walking two
and striking out five, and he went a bullpen-best 31/3 innings in his
last outing. So when a spot in the rotation opened up with Jose
Acevedo's demotion to triple-A Louisville on Tuesday, Rijo got his
chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Twin pitcher Joe Mays said he might not be ready to come
off the disabled list April 30. His inflamed right elbow hasn't made
any progress and he said he'll have to rest some more before resuming
throwing.... Boston Red Sox center fielder Johnny Damon didn't break
a finger, X-rays revealed. He was struck on the left middle finger
while trying to bunt in Friday's game.</TE>

<LD>Playoff collapses. Team dissension. Questionable character.</LD>
<LD>   The Portland Trail Blazers have been an easy target for criticism.
They took another hit last week when it was revealed that guard Damon
Stoudamire is being investigated for felony drug possession.</LD>
<LD>   But the team's long-suffering fans have remained loyal despite
having to swallow a steady dose of disappointment, prompting Chuck
Culpepper of the Oregonian to ask, "How could any fan anywhere suffer
more? ...</LD>
<TE>   "Here comes another helping of fret, more evidence of that
perpetual cloud overhead. So the Blazers' fan, hardy soul, teeters
again. He's some challenged species.</TE>
<TE>   "Will he topple once more? Will he remain upright? How much more
can he take?"</TE>
<TE>   Starting today, the Lakers will try to add to his misery.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was selected the last time a Houston franchise
had the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft?</TE>
<TE>   Winning losers: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle took
the Golden State Warriors to task for beating the Clippers on
Wednesday and tying the Chicago Bulls for the NBA's worst record:</TE>
<TE>   "By accidentally beating the Clippers, the Warriors lost 25
Ping-Pong balls. This season-closing win not only hurts the Warriors'
chances of getting the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, it lessens
the impact of their new advertising slogan: 'We've got a lot of
balls.'</TE>
<TE>   "The upshot is that the Warriors have a 25-balls-smaller chance at
getting one of the three players they might select with the top
pick--Duke's Jason Williams, China's Yao 'Dynasty' Ming, and Terrell
Owens."</TE>
<TE>   Bull riding: Apathy has become the name of the game with the
Bulls' followers, according to Rick Telander of the Chicago
Sun-Times:</TE>
<TE>   "Since General Manager Jerry Krause began his 'rebuilding' program
immediately after the Bulls' NBA crown in 1998, the Bulls have won
only 66 games. That is six fewer than they won in the 1995-96 regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh well. As I said, we are mutely beaten down and thought-free
and--like lobotomized inmates--OK with everything."</TE>
<TE>   Tough mamas: Mary Hutter, 45, a mother of three, and her daughter
Rashida Jackson, 24, a mother of two, are making an impact as players
for the New Orleans Voodoo Dolls of the Women's American Football
League.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought if they broke a nail they'd be crying," Coach Joseph
Riley said. "But they [are] tough. Mary [is] the oldest player on the
team, and I think the toughest. She hit me a couple of times in
practice and I laughed, but it really hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Hutter said she has only cried once--when an injured teammate was
carried from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Texas running back Earl Campbell by the Houston
Oilers in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Chan Gailey, conducting his first spring practice as
coach at Georgia Tech, says he doesn't miss the NFL and enjoys the
players' attitudes in college.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys seem eager to be here," said Gailey, former coach of
the Dallas Cowboys. "There's a lot of enthusiasm and emotion in the
game for them every day. It seems like, in the pros, that tends to
happen only on game day or toward the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's enjoyable to go to practice here."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Keep Brave Front</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Perez has another strong outing and Jordan homers
in 4-1 victory over Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The undisputed ace of the Dodger staff pitching staff was put on the
disabled list before Saturday night's game against the San Diego
Padres.</LD>
<LD>   But Kevin Brown's absence does not mean the Dodgers are without a
dominant presence.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander Odalis Perez came within an out of pitching his first
career shutout and his second consecutive complete game as the
Dodgers defeated the Padres, 4-1, before 41,000 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Perez, 23, gave up one run, six hits, struck out five and walked
two in 82/3 innings before Giovanni Carrara came in with two runners
on and retired pinch-hitter Ray Lankford on a fly ball to the
center-field wall for his first career save.</TE>
<TE>   Perez (2-1), who pitched his first complete game against the
Colorado Rockies last Monday at hitter-friendly Coors Field, narrowly
missed becoming the first Dodger to throw consecutive complete games
since Brown accomplished the feat with three in a row in 2000. When
Bubba Trammell singled in Phil Nevin from third base with two out in
the ninth, Perez fell short of throwing the first shutout by a Dodger
since Chan Ho Park beat the Milwaukee Brewers, 1-0, last July 18.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was another impressive outing for Perez, who lowered his
earned-run average to 2.15.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the year I've been looking for," said Perez, who was
acquired from the Atlanta Braves in the trade for outfielder Gary
Sheffield last January. "I'm the No. 3 pitcher here. I know I'm going
to pitch every five days. The responsibility is bigger now."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan, also acquired in the Sheffield deal, hit a two-run
homer off the left-field foul pole in the fourth inning, Cesar
Izturis had a run-scoring double in the fifth and Shawn Green blasted
a 433-foot home run into the right-field pavilion in the eighth as
the Dodgers won their fourth game in a row and improved to 11-7.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers conclude their brief four-game home stand against the
Padres today before departing for a six-game trip to Pittsburgh and
Chicago. They will not have the services of Brown, who was placed on
the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodger pitching staff has been humming along since being
swept in a season-opening series against the San Francisco Giants.
With Perez's performance Saturday, Dodger starters have a 2.60 ERA.
They have not given up an earned run in seven of the last 15 games
and have given up two earned runs or fewer in 13 of their last 15
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Perez threw 116 pitches, including 22 first-pitch strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's aggressive, he goes after people. He just doesn't go after
the middle of the plate," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres were impressed too.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be patient with a guy like that," Nevin said. "He
was hitting with the fastball and the change-up. We helped him out a
little bit, but he threw a good game."</TE>
<TE>   Perez lost his bid for a shutout with two out in the ninth when
Nevin hit a grounder that bounced past Izturis at shortstop for a
single. The game appeared to be over when Ryan Klesko hit a pop fly
ball to right field, but the ball fell behind second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek for a single to put runners at first and third. Bubba
Trammell followed with a bloop single to right to make the score 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said before the game that he would not hesitate to use
closer Eric Gagne for a fourth consecutive night if the situation
warranted, but with Perez cruising along, it was Carrara who warmed
up and got the call.</TE>
<TE>   Lankford, pinch-hitting for Deivi Cruz, hit Carrara's second pitch
deep to center field. Marquis Grissom drifted back to the wall and
caught the ball to preserve the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he hit it that hard," Carrara said, "but it scared
me."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in five games, the Dodgers did not score in the
first inning. Padre starter Bobby Jones (1-1) held them at bay until
the fourth when Paul Lo Duca set the table for Jordan with a one-out
double into the right-field gap. One out later, Jordan stepped in and
took a strike before belting a shot down the left-field line. The
ball crashed into the foul pole for Jordan's second homer and a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   A sacrifice bunt by Perez helped set up Izturis' RBI double into
the gap in the fifth, giving the Dodgers a 3-0 lead, and Green
produced the Dodgers' final run with his third homer, a one-out shot
in the eighth against Matt DeWitt.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Playing It Safe, Brown Goes on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown, who missed a start after re-injuring his
surgically repaired right elbow April 13, was placed on the disabled
list Saturday and will miss at least one more turn.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers recalled reliever Guillermo Mota from triple-A Las
Vegas to take Brown's roster spot and Omar Daal will continue to
start in Brown's place.</LD>
<LD>   Brown missed Thursday's start against the San Diego Padres at
Dodger Stadium and was scheduled to pitch at Pittsburgh on Wednesday
in the second game of a six-game trip. But there is still swelling in
the area where Brown tore scar tissue in his last start against the
San Diego Padres at Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Brown has been playing catch on flat ground since he was injured.
He threw off a mound for the first time Saturday, making 33 pitches.
But the Dodgers, who have received outstanding performances from
their starting pitchers since Brown's injury, put him on the disabled
list even before that workout.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to roll the dice any longer," General Manager Dan
Evans said. "All it took was one game for a starter to go short, and
then we'd make a panic call. I thought Lady Luck had been real good
to us for six games."</TE>
<TE>   This is Brown's fifth trip to the disabled list since signing a
$105-million free-agent contract with the Dodgers on Dec 12, 1998. He
said he thought he was capable of pitching at Pittsburgh on
Wednesday, but he accepted the club's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I can throw, but it's not something I can put in a
guarantee, and with that being the case it's not worth risking the
health of the pitching staff," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is eligible to be activated April 29, an off day before his
next turn in the rotation against the Cincinnati Reds at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said adding Mota to the staff will enable him to
continue using his bullpen in a way that has allowed closer Eric
Gagne to get seven saves. Tracy said he expects Brown to be ready to
pitch against the Reds on April 30.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that a guarantee? Is that etched in stone? No, it's not,"
Tracy said. "We'll see how he's doing. We'll see how his elbow
responds from session to session as they build his workload back up."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Brian Jordan said putting Brown on the disabled list
will allow the ultracompetitive pitcher to come back stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "He's willing to throw even when he's pain, but I don't want to
see him set himself back," Jordan said. "We have some people who can
fill in for this team. We need him to be 100%."</TE>

<HD>Mayweather Wins, Then Hype Begins</HD>
<DH>Boxing: He takes WBC lightweight title from Castillo.
Unanimous decision criticized by Arum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It certainly wasn't the first time promoter Bob Arum stood at a
microphone in a postfight news conference to rage against the judges'
scoring.</LD>
<LD>   But it was the first time he had done so after one of his key
fighters had won.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after Floyd Mayweather Jr. was given a unanimous decision
over Jose Luis Castillo at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday
night to capture Castillo's World Boxing Council lightweight
championship, Arum was protesting the margin of the decision.</LD>
<TE>   Judges Jerry Roth and John Keane both had it 115-111. Judge Anek
Hongtongkam had it 116-111.</TE>
<TE>   The Times scored it 114-112 for Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   "I disagree with the way the [judges'] scoring went," Arum said.
"It's not that I feel Mayweather didn't win, but not by this margin.
This is ludicrous. How could two judges give Mayweather the 12th
round? How could that happen."</TE>
<TE>   There was, of course, method to Arum's madness.</TE>
<TE>   His scathing comments on the officials were followed
immediately--surprise, surprise--by a spirited cry for a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Promoted, of course, by Arum, since he also has Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to call Staples Center on Monday morning," Arum said.
"We can get 19,000 people there."</TE>
<TE>   Which would be a huge improvement over the 6,920 at MGM on
Saturday night, with a percentage of those tickets given away,
according to a member of the promotional organization.</TE>
<TE>   Arum is hoping to stage the rematch in August.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather (28-0, 20 knockouts), the former WBC
super-featherweight champion making his first appearance at 135
pounds, conceded it wasn't one of his best fights, but said he had
hurt his left shoulder Wednesday while hitting a punching bag,
severely reducing the mobility in his left arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I pulled my rotator cuff," he said, "and it affected my jab. It
was a closer fight because of that. I would like to give him another
fight when Floyd Mayweather is 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo (45-5-1, 41), making the fourth defense of the title he
won from Stevie Johnston in 2000, saw it differently, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he doesn't use an excuse about his hand," said Castillo
through a translator, apparently not understanding Mayweather's
excuse was his shoulder. "Every time he doesn't look good, he says it
was his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I won the fight. I think I made it an intelligent fight. I told
you before I was going to win and I did. I showed the world what I am
made of. I proved Floyd Mayweather is not the best pound-for-pound
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he is a gentleman. I hope he sets up an immediate
rematch."</TE>
<TE>   Through five rounds, Mayweather appeared to be cruising to an easy
victory as he was on his toes, landing punches at will and shifting
smoothly from his right-handed style to southpaw and back. He stayed
out of harm's way when Castillo got aggressive and generally confused
the fighter from Sonora, Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo admitted it took him a while to figure out Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   But in the middle rounds, Castillo's punches started to land,
especially to the body.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo won a clear decision on the punch stats. He landed 203
punches, connecting at a 40% success rate, while Mayweather connected
on only 157 punches, successful at a 35% rate.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo came on strong at the end as well, inspiring Arum to
begin his poorly disguised hype job for a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, Johnston (34-2-1, 16) won a majority
decision over Alejandro "Cobrita" Gonzalez (48-5-1, 33), a former WBC
featherweight champ.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Dave Moretti (116-112) and Carol Castellano (115-113) had
Johnston the winner. Judge Paul Smith ruled it a draw at 114-114.</TE>
<TE>   There were no knockdowns in a match that drew boos at times
because of a lack of drama.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest drama for Johnston occurred last month when he spent
eight days in a Denver jail for failure to pay child support.</TE>
<TE>   Being in prison didn't affect his training, Johnston insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "They let me run up and down the stairs," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Rewarding Finish for Busy Dantzscher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Jamie Dantzscher ran out of energy after competing in every event for
three consecutive days at the NCAA women's gymnastics championships.
The UCLA sophomore also ran out of adjectives to describe her elation
at winning the vault title and sharing the floor exercise title with
Nicole Arnstad of Louisiana State Saturday at Coleman Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "I was half dead, but I made it through," said Dantzscher, who had
won the all-around championship Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Winning two events was really cool."</LD>
<TE>   The season, she said, was "really cool." Coming back to win the
vault after she ended her dismount from the balance beam in a sitting
position was cool too.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nervous on my second vault," she said. "I had no idea where
I was. I got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, was cool too.</TE>
<TE>   But if Dantzscher couldn't find new ways to describe her feats,
she and her Bruin teammates found new ways to rebound in Saturday's
individual event finals 24 hours after their two-year reign as team
champion had been ended by Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Although Andree Pickens of Alabama won the uneven bars title, Doni
Thompson of UCLA was second, Onnie Willis was third, and defending
champion Yvonne Tousek and Dantzscher shared fifth place with Alexis
Maday of Iowa and Theresa Kulikowski of Utah. Willis also shared
sixth place in floor exercise.</TE>
<TE>   On the beam, which was won by Michigan sophomore Elise Ray, Alyssa
Beckerman of UCLA finished in a tie for seventh, and Dantzscher was
13th.</TE>
<TE>   Ray, last year's all-around co-champion, won with a smooth,
assertive routine that earned her a 9.925, just ahead of Alabama's
Jeana Rice (9.912).</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after her faulty dismount from the beam, Dantzscher had to
switch her focus to the vault, where she was the last competitor. She
appeared to take a small step on each of her two vaults--each
competitor performs two different vaults, and the six scores are
averaged after the high and low scores are discarded--but she got
three perfect 10s for the second vault. Her winning score was 9.9565,
edging Marline Stephens of Georgia (9.505) and Pickens (9.9250).</TE>
<TE>   LSU's Arnstad was a dynamo on floor exercise, earning a 9.95.
Dantzscher also was a vision of controlled power and excellent
technique, which also earned her a 9.95.</TE>
<TE>   Pickens, who finished in a tie for sixth on the floor, won the
final event, the uneven bars. She scored a 9.925--and, unlike
Thursday's team preliminary, when she hit her face on the bar, she
emerged unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I have all my teeth," she said, joking through her
tears.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been four great years. I was just excited to have a routine
I didn't hit my chin on ... Just to finish my career this way, I'm
happy.''</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins believe their strong showing bodes well for regaining
supremacy next season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to go out," Thompson said. "Our team has no
regrets, and that's the best way to end the season."</TE>
<TE>   Said Willis: "We were not the championship team we wanted to be,
but by the end, we got things together."</TE>

<DH>Hockey: Forsberg gets three points in second game back as
Avalanche defeats Kings for 2-0 series lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Of the 16 teams that made the NHL playoffs, only the New Jersey
Devils and Montreal Canadiens scored fewer goals this season than the
Colorado Avalanche, which won its eighth consecutive division
championship behind the league's best defense and the goaltending of
Patrick Roy.</LD>
<LD>   But you'd have a hard time convincing the Kings, buried again by
the Avalanche offense Saturday in a 5-3 loss in Game 2 of their
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series in front of a sellout crowd of
18,007 in the Pepsi Center.</LD>
<LD>   While opening a 2-0 series lead, the Avalanche has scored nine
goals against a King team that set a club record with a 2.29
goals-against average.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the injection of Peter Forsberg into the Avalanche
lineup has added much-needed firepower to an offense that set
regular-season franchise records for fewest goals scored and number
of times shut out.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, who had two assists Thursday night in his first game
since May 9, contributed three more points Saturday, among them a
second-period goal that erased a 3-2 deficit and spelled the
beginning of the end for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Winless in their last eight road games, the Kings were outscored,
3-0, in the last 28 minutes 55 seconds, former King Steven Reinprecht
scoring the game-winning goal on a redirection with 3:15 to play in
the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Sakic also had three points for the Avalanche, among them two
goals, and Chris Drury scored an insurance goal with 11:15 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, which averaged 2.59 goals during the regular season
and was shut out 10 times, outshot the Kings, 38-31.</TE>
<TE>   "If you give up [almost] 40 shots, that team's going to score
goals," King defenseman Aaron Miller said. "They're the best
defensive team in the league and we scored three goals in each game.
That's got to be enough for us to win, and it hasn't been because
we're giving up too many scoring chances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something we're going to have to fix. We've got to bear
down. Obviously, we're going to have to play a low-scoring, checking
game to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who overcame deficits of 2-0 and 3-2 in their 4-3 loss
in Game 1, erased a 1-0 lead Saturday and led, 2-1, after scoring on
their first and fifth shots against Roy, Adam Deadmarsh and Mikko
Eloranta netting the goals.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Allison's first goal in seven games gave the Kings a 3-2
lead with 11:17 to play in the second period, but Forsberg scored on
a rebound less than 21/2 minutes later, pulling the Avalanche even.</TE>
<TE>   The 43rd playoff goal of his career was the first of any kind for
the six-time All-Star since April 30, when he helped the Avalanche to
a 4-3 victory over the Kings in Game 3 of their Western Conference
semifinal series.</TE>
<TE>   The Swede was sidelined for the last 11 months after emergency
surgery to have his spleen removed in May and four other surgeries on
his ankles and left foot, but returned to the lineup just in time to
cause the Kings fits.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was good the first game too," Miller said, "but he
was even better today. He's one of the guys we have to stop, but
they've got a lot of guys like that."</TE>
<TE>   One is Reinprecht, the forgotten man in the February 2001 trade
that brought Deadmarsh and Miller to the Kings and sent All-Star
defenseman Rob Blake and Reinprecht to the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring a goal in Game 1, Reinprecht put the Avalanche ahead
to stay Saturday, charging down the slot and redirecting a pass from
Sakic out of the air and between the pads of King goaltender Felix
Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means do we want to get into these kind of up-and-down
games," King center Bryan Smolinski said. "We've got to tighten up on
their better players. We've given them too much space, and obviously
it shows on the scoresheet."</TE>
<TE>   It shows in the results too.</TE>
<TE>   Like last season, the Kings opened the playoffs on the road and
returned home with only two losses to show for their travels. They
rallied to win four consecutive games and eliminate the Detroit Red
Wings last season, overcoming a 2-0 series deficit for the only time
in their mostly forgettable playoff history.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year's last year," Potvin said, "but of course we feel good
coming back home. But we would have liked to have won here."</TE>
<TE>   With a spotty defense, however, it was too much to ask.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: As Lakers prepare for defense of their two
championships, O'Neal says this one's on him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal is beginning to think legacy, which is very much
like him.</LD>
<LD>   More properly, he's starting to feel it.</LD>
<LD>   He no longer dunks over Los Angeles from the south wall of the
Hotel Figueroa, where now some radio guy's two-story uvula dangles.
But he predicted he would awake this morning, the day the Lakers have
stared at since the city swept up after the last parade, feeling
bigger than that.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers start over today--Game 1 and Series 1--and it is their
time, they're sure, to become only the fifth NBA team to win three
consecutive championships. O'Neal is reasonably hale after a season
spent favoring his degenerative big toe, and Robert Horry is expected
to play, and Kobe Bryant wore his dead eyes after practice Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   They play the Portland Trail Blazers this afternoon at Staples
Center, where two of the eight gold banners belong to this team, to
O'Neal and Bryant and Coach Phil Jackson and the others who came
along, feet up. It is a best-of-five series, round one of four, no
more preparation, no more waiting, no more wondering if their tired
legs would carry them through even one more day of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the moment we've been waiting for," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, perhaps, more than anyone. Criticized for being out of shape
and out of touch and, sometimes, out of patience, O'Neal had another
trying regular season where he probably won't be the most valuable
player, officially speaking, despite being the most dominant player,
by far.</TE>
<TE>   He played just often enough to be him, and just well enough to
lead the Lakers to 58 victories. But, as O'Neal gets older, so too
does November through March get more dreary, and so for the first
time Jackson will try to win a league title without having won a
division title.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a load off our shoulders," Bryant admitted, "to
finally get to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   No one will cop to being concerned about that, but they aren't yet
listening to the national anthem at Arco Arena before Game 1 of the
Western Conference finals, either.</TE>
<TE>   As the Trail Blazers practiced on the arena floor Saturday
afternoon, O'Neal was asked about the possibility for three
consecutive championships, a feat exacted only by the Minneapolis
Lakers, the Boston Celtics and by the Chicago Bulls, twice in the
'90s, while he was growing into what he is now.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it'll mean something," he said, as if so many things
don't.</TE>
<TE>   And while the hallway filled around him with teammates and
coaches, as the postseason stirred from East Rutherford, N.J., to
Sacramento with reminders that unusual things happen in the most
ordinary circumstances, O'Neal said that No. 3--if there is to be
one--was his to lose. He wanted to be held accountable, no matter the
result.</TE>
<TE>   "I take all the responsibility," O'Neal said. "I've taken all the
responsibility my whole career.</TE>
<TE>   "And if something does happen, I don't want you guys to make
excuses for me."</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers lose, O'Neal said, if their three-peat hopes die at
two and the confetti is shipped to some other place this year, he
doesn't want to hear about his arthritic toe, or his taped wrist, or
what he almost did.</TE>
<TE>   "I take all the responsibility," he said. "That's what a general
does. I'm Powell. Phil is Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Their postseason starts where last year's did, with the Trail
Blazers, where a victory in Game 1 led to 10 more in a row, all the
way to Game 1 of the NBA Finals. The Trail Blazers changed rosters
and coaches, radical alterations that shot them all the way from the
No. 7 seed to No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trail Blazers drew some momentum from two regular-season
victories against the Lakers, the latest last Sunday in Portland, in
two overtimes. When it ended--actually, just before it ended--Ruben
Patterson, their aggressive swingman, stood on the scorers' table and
shook his fists gleefully at a crowd that an hour before had hurled
Bill Walton dolls to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later, he declared the Trail Blazers had cracked the
mystery to beating the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of have their number," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won four consecutive postseason series from
Portland, including a sweep in the first round last year. The year
before, the Lakers won in seven games in the conference finals. "They
get better," Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks said, "as the playoffs
come around."</TE>
<TE>   As for Patterson's estimation, Cheeks smiled and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to talk to him about that," he said. "If we win the
series, then we have their number. Until that happens, we have to
play smart, continuous basketball. They're the defending champs. We
can't forget that."</TE>
<TE>   That goes for everyone. Jackson called it an "intuitive mind-set,"
the recollection of games won before, series won before, and how.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't replicate what you've done in the past," Jackson said.
"What you try to do is build on the players you have right here."</TE>
<TE>   On that level, Jackson said, "No doubt [we've] pointed toward
this. This is the focal point of the year."</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly," he added, "it's about anticipation, about not getting
ahead of yourself, about playing each game for its own game, each
play for its own play."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it's about what that all adds up to.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow," O'Neal said, "when I wake up, I'll be excited. I'll be
excited."</TE>

<HD>Roush's Condition Stabilizes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NASCAR team owner Jack Roush was in critical but stable condition
Saturday after crashing a small plane into a pond about 100 miles
from Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., where his drivers
are racing this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Roush was being treated at University of Alabama-Birmingham
Hospital for a head injury and two broken legs.</LD>
<LD>   He was flying alone Friday night when the borrowed plane
apparently hit a power line and crashed into a pond, flipping upside
down. The accident occurred in a neighborhood in Troy, about 50 miles
from Montgomery.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, what we need to be doing is praying for Jack and
taking care of business," said Mark Martin, who has driven for Roush
since the owner came to the Winston Cup series in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Smith, team manager for Roush Racing, said there was never
any question the Roush team would continue racing at Talladega, in
Saturday's Busch Series event and today's Aaron's 499 Winston Cup
race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Keller avoided a wild pileup that involved most of the
43-car field, then held off a strong challenge from Stacy Compton to
win the Aaron's 312 Busch Series race at Talladega, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Only 21 cars were running at the finish after a big accident left
29 cars scattered all over the backstretch pavement and on the
infield grass. There were no major injuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Riverside's Todd Burns fought off Tim Huddleston to win the 50-lap
Southern California Auto Club Late Model Series feature race at
Irwindale Speedway in front of 5,768 fans. The win tied Burns with
former Super Stock driver T. K. Karvasek for the most career
victories at the track, with 23.</TE>
<TE>   In the 40-lap Vista Paint Super Stock series feature, Phelan's
Darren Cheek won his fourth consecutive race.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>It's an Honorable Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is there to say at this point of every season except:</LD>
<LD>   Thank heavens that's over!</LD>
<LD>   It was great in many places, such as New Jersey, Detroit and
Sacramento. The Clippers were entertaining until April when the
players got a little antsy and the front office wigged out. For the
twice-defending NBA champion Lakers, of course, it was a time-serving
exercise.</LD>
<TE>   With that in mind, it's time to hand out the awards that seem so
meaningful now (the league's, not mine) but will soon be forgotten
when the one that counts--the Larry O'Brien Trophy--is presented.</TE>
<TE>   Here's my little version of this over-hyped rite of spring, the
Iconoclast Awards. My motto: I may not always disagree with my
colleagues, but I intend to try.</TE>
<TE>   Most valuable player--Tim Duncan, San Antonio. I wanted to vote
for Shaquille O'Neal, who's so dominant he should win every year he
shows up, which is what I used to do with Michael Jordan. Of course,
Mike never had weak seasons and by Shaq's standards, this wasn't
tip-top, was it? Meanwhile, Duncan, whose career numbers were up
there, posted new highs in points, rebounds and assists.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it's 2) Shaq, who's still Shaq, after all, and 3)
Jason Kidd, who was brilliant, even if his shooting percentage (39%)
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Winner in real life--Kidd, because the Eastern bloc will go
heavily for him.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive player of the year--Ben Wallace, Detroit. Dennis Rodman
without the issues. Played center at 6-foot-8, 230 pounds, led the
league in rebounds and blocks and was in the top 20 in steals.</TE>
<TE>   Runner-up--Ron Artest, Indiana. Game's most disruptive
defender/teammate, especially for a guard, who is 6-7, 245. Great on
the ball, great off the ball but he's so intense, they have to talk
him down out of his tree daily. Let's hope he chills just a tad.</TE>
<TE>   Winner in real life--Wallace. Because he has numbers, which
sportswriters need, they can't mess this up.</TE>
<TE>   Coach of the year--Rick Carlisle, Detroit. An assistant under
Larry Bird, he was considered too tough on players to succeed his
mentor in Indiana. Finally getting his shot, he turned the Pistons
around by teaching them to defend, going from No. 23 last season to
No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's so solicitous of feelings, he called more than 100
writers to ask them to consider his players for awards, tracking many
down on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up--Byron Scott, New Jersey; Mo Cheeks, Portland and Nate
McMillan, Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's outspoken style was a breath of fresh air last season,
which turned out to be a nightmare, but this one was a dream.
McMillan, another tell-the-truth and let-them-deal-with-it guy, made
the playoffs with Gary Payton, Rashard Lewis and 10 guys named
Desmond or Predrag. Cheeks, written off as overmatched (who wouldn't
have been?), rallied the crew that, another West coach notes, "would
have driven Dean Smith out of coaching."</TE>
<TE>   Winner in real life--In a toss-up, Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie of the year--Pau Gasol, Memphis. Supporters of other
candidates grouse he ran up numbers with a bad team, but 18 points,
nine rebounds, three assists and 52% from the floor, for a
seven-footer who's still just 19 and will only get bigger and better,
was remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   Runner-up--Tony Parker, San Antonio. Jamaal Tinsley and Shane
Battier were nice, but this kid, another prodigy who's still 19,
starts at the point for an elite team.</TE>
<TE>   Winner in real life--Gasol. Easiest pick on the board.</TE>
<TE>   Most Improved--Michael Olowokandi, Clippers. Made his move too
late to wind up with big numbers, meaning he'll be passed over, but
there aren't many athletic, happening seven-footers on the horizon.
Unless you count Chicago's Tyson Chandler, who's several years away,
there aren't any.</TE>
<TE>   Winner in real life--Minnesota's Wally Szczerbiak, who may also be
trade bait again if he keeps ticking off his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth man of the year--Quentin Richardson, Clippers. Remarkably
poised as a rookie No. 18 pick who seemingly had no position, he
became a mini-impact player in his second season and looks like he's
only warming up.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Corliss Williamson, Detroit, and Troy Hudson, Orlando.
Williamson averaged 14 points and shot 52% in 22 minutes for the
NBA's highest scoring bench. Hudson, whom Doc Rivers wouldn't use
last season, led all reserves in scoring after the break.</TE>
<TE>   Executives of the year--Rod Thorn, New Jersey, and Geoff Petrie,
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Kidd-Stephon Marbury deal was a blunder by the Suns
and a stroke of luck for Thorn, who'd been told to dump salaries,
getting Richard Jefferson and Jason Collins for Eddie Griffin and
signing Todd MacCulloch were great too.</TE>
<TE>   Petrie, arriving as Mitch Richmond asked to be traded and
attendance dropped by 15% in a single season, turned it around,
getting Chris Webber, Vlade Divac, Peja Stojakovic, Hedo Turkoglu,
Mike Bibby, et al.</TE>
<TE>   All-NBA--Shaq, Duncan, Kidd, Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant morphed out of his own-my-own-planet persona, posting
career numbers in assists and assist-turnover ratio, but his scoring
dropped from 28.4 to 25.4 and people actually said he'd had an
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's blessing/curse is playing with O'Neal. They might win a
lot more titles, but most of the credit will inevitably go to Shaq.
If Kobe can accept that, as he seemed to this season, it will show
how far he has come.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of sharp basketball people think McGrady is better, because
he's bigger and a better defender in the post. However, Bryant just
averaged 25.2, playing with O'Neal, while McGrady averaged 25.6,
playing with helpers. Not that this settles the argument, or that it
will be settled soon, but if Kobe were in Orlando, he'd be scoring
more than 25.6.</TE>
<TE>   All-NBA in real life--Shaq, Duncan, McGrady, Kidd and Allen
Iverson or Gary Payton.</TE>
<TE>   Most underrated--David Robinson, San Antonio. Drifts 'til the
All-Star break and at 36, is annually written off but few realize how
much he has given up for Duncan. My bet is without Duncan, he'd still
average 20. Unlike his old rivals, Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing,
Admiral can still move around.</TE>
<TE>   Most overrated--Vince Carter, Toronto. His act, which was already
lame, blew up entirely when his departure, not his presence, turned
the season around. As far as stardom goes, he's starting over.</TE>
<TE>   Crummy coach of the year--George Karl, Milwaukee. Insisted on
signing old, malcontented, ball-monopolizing, earth-bound but,
unfortunately, still talkative Anthony Mason. Ripped his players,
who'd started 26-13, daily until they tuned him out and finished
15-28. Said he wasn't going to blame it on injuries, zinging his
players anew ("Great players ... don't wear the armor of sympathy" he
told Sports Illustrated, "but that's not the gig today. The gig today
is to talk about injuries, beg for sympathy.") Then he begged for
sympathy, saying it was the injuries. The problem is Karl's head,
which has been spinning like that little girl's in "The Exorcist"
since owner Herb Kohl bumped him to $7 million a year just for making
the playoffs. George is used to worrying, not being doted on, and
hasn't figured out how to handle it.</TE>
<TE>   Crummy executives of the year--George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge,
Charlotte. New Orleans is smaller with little corporate money and,
even in a recruiting mode, tepid interest. However, to David Stern's
consternation, the feud between Hornet owners and Charlotte officials
doomed the franchise--which led the NBA in attendance for seven
seasons in a row in the '90s--in what was so recently a hotbed.</TE>
<TE>   Runner-up--Michael Heisley, Memphis. In three seasons as owner, he
has been through two GMs, one coach and one city. After ditching
Vancouver, he gave hard-headed Jason Williams and oft-injured Michael
Dickerson $40- million deals without consulting President Dick
Versace, messing up their cap as they were set to emerge from the
shadow of Bryant Reeves' contract. Just fired GM Billy Knight and is
dangling Versace by a thread. Might just have a problem taking
responsibility for anything that doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Summers Heisler You Think You Know So Much Awards--Given
in the name of my long-suffering wife, for my shakiest calls of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   So let's (shudder) get to it.</TE>
<TE>   In December, I announced unequivocally 76er Coach Larry Brown, who
has rarely turned around once it occurred to him to leave, was gone.
He's still there, vowing to stay. Just in case he pulls off the 180
of his career, oops.</TE>
<TE>   Before the season, I listed everything that had, or could, go
wrong with the 76ers, all of which did, and still picked them No. 2
in the East. Way to disregard your own stuff.</TE>
<TE>   I picked Toronto to come out of the East. Of course, they still
might, but I didn't say they would have to wait 'til Carter left,
first.</TE>
<TE>   I had Miami ranked anywhere from No. 5 to No. 25 as I tried to
figure out what the Heat really was. The answer turned out to be a
lot closer to 25 than 5.</TE>

<HD>This Might Be His Greatest Comeback Yet</HD>
<DH>NFL draft: Oregon's Harrington, famous for engineering
dramatic rallies, is out-of-nowhere No. 3 choice by Lions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Folks back home nicknamed him Captain Comeback, and for good reason.
Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington led the Ducks to 10
fourth-quarter, come-from-behind victories in his career.</LD>
<LD>   His latest masterpiece shook up the NFL draft.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit grabbed Harrington with the No. 3 pick Saturday, two spots
after Houston drafted Fresno State quarterback David Carr. Coming
into the draft, the Lions dropped heavy hints they would use their
top pick on Texas cornerback Quentin Jammer, who wound up going fifth
to San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   "I was unbelievably surprised," Harrington said on a conference
call. He passed on a chance to attend the draft in New York, instead
choosing to watch it in Oregon with his family and friends. "I was
told five minutes earlier that [the Lions] were going in another
direction. I was just about to sit down with my mom and dad and watch
the Lions pick another player. I got a phone call and I was shocked,
caught off guard and thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   The quick pick of Harrington, who might have slipped to Kansas
City at No. 8 or Cincinnati at No. 10, was one of several notable
developments in the first round of the two-day draft. Among the
others:</TE>
<TE>   * Dallas made a trade with Kansas City, allowing the Chiefs to
sneak ahead of Minnesota and snatch North Carolina defensive tackle
Ryan Sims, a player the Vikings wanted. The move was especially
frustrating to Minnesota because Dallas appeared to cut the deal
after the 15-minute clock had expired.</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati used the 10th pick to select Arizona State tackle
Levi Jones, a player projected to go much later in the first round.
Just another befuddling move by one of the league's worst franchises.</TE>
<TE>   * The only player from a Southern California school to go in the
first round was UCLA linebacker Robert Thomas, drafted 31st by St.
Louis. Three spots later, with the second pick of the second round,
Carolina took Bruin running back DeShaun Foster.</TE>
<TE>   * Five Miami Hurricanes were selected in the first round, tying a
record set by USC in 1968. Also, the opening round included a record
three tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   * Hungry for defensive players, the Raiders made two trades--first
with Washington, then with Atlanta--to move up and grab Miami
cornerback Phillip Buchanon at No. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Many scouts predicted Buchanon would be a top-10 pick, ranking him
just behind Jammer. Raider owner Al Davis has always emphasized
building a defense around shut-down cornerbacks, and 36-year-old
right corner Eric Allen is nearing the end of his career. Buchanon,
who also returns punts, earned All-America honors at cornerback last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means are we anointing him a starter," Oakland Coach Bill
Callahan told reporters. "He does give us more options, and with a
cover corner like that, you can't pass it up."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders, who have drafted a defensive back in the first round
three times in five years, used their other first-round pick on
Northwestern linebacker Napoleon Harris. Harris is the third Napoleon
in Raider history, following running backs McCallum and Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, the premier linebacker on the board, is known for his
ability to knock people senseless. But the most aggressive guy in the
draft Saturday might have been Chris Shropshire, Kansas City's
150-pound equipment manager. When the clock had run out on Dallas,
and a Minnesota official was holding a card with Sims' name scribbled
on it, Shropshire stood in front of the podium and would not get out
of the way. Those few seconds were all the Cowboys and Chiefs needed
to get the deal done.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the TV and they were down to zero-zero, and [the
trade] still hadn't been confirmed," Chief President Carl Peterson
said. "It said Minnesota was standing behind them. But they didn't
allow them to make their pick."</TE>
<TE>   After a few moments of confusion, Sims was headed to Kansas City
and the Vikings were left to make another pick. They grudgingly chose
Miami tackle Bryant McKinnie, a player they like, but not as much as
Sims.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely the words of Minnesota Coach Mike Tice will be much
consolation to McKinnie: "We called New York and we were in [with the
Sims pick]. We'll let them sort that situation out in New York, but
we were in with the pick. At 1:39 last night I woke up sweating and
dreamed I was announcing Bryant McKinnie as our first pick."</TE>
<TE>   The deal worked out flawlessly for Dallas, which still landed the
player it wanted with the No. 8 selection, Oklahoma safety Roy
Williams, and collected Kansas City's third-round pick (75th overall)
and a sixth-round pick next year.</TE>
<TE>   While the Cowboys were wheeling and dealing, their hated rivals
were stifling a yawn. Midway through the first round--before his team
had even made a pick--Washington Redskin owner Daniel Snyder jumped
into his personal helicopter with Coach Steve Spurrier and defensive
coordinator Marvin Lewis. The trio made a quick trip from Redskin
headquarters to Fedex Field to make an appearance at the team's draft
party. About two hours later, the Redskins used the 32nd pick on
Tulane quarterback Patrick Ramsey.</TE>
<TE>   So the first round began and ended with the selection of a
quarterback. But the most interesting story may be the quarterback
taken in between: Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Oregon standout will compete for the starting job
with Mike McMahon, Detroit's fifth-round selection in 2001. But the
Lions are already selling Harrington jerseys on their Web site.</TE>

<HD>Brewers Win Again Under Royster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Royster has a simple explanation for the Milwaukee Brewers'
success since he replaced Davey Lopes as manager.</LD>
<LD>   The Brewers won their third in a row under Royster, defeating the
St. Louis Cardinals, 5-3, Saturday at Milwaukee behind Alex Sanchez's
tiebreaking single in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason for the turnaround is that we were so bad, there was
no place else to go," Royster said. "I can't be any more serious than
that. We went two weeks with really not hitting."</LD>
<TE>   Milwaukee, 3-12 when Lopes was fired Thursday, has won three in a
row for the first time since a four-game streak last Aug. 16-19.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't worried about the past," said Royster, interim manager
while the team searches for a permanent replacement. "We've played
very good baseball the last three days. We've hit, played defense and
pitched very well. We've also run the bases extremely well. We've
executed extremely well. That turns into victories."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Vizcaino (2-1) retired the only batter he faced in the
seventh inning for the victory and Mike DeJean finished for his third
save in four chances.</TE>
<TE>   Starter Glendon Rusch gave up one run and four hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 13, Houston 9--J.T. Snow tied a career high with
four hits and drove in five runs as the Giants remained unbeaten in
11 games at Astros Field.</TE>
<TE>   Snow capped the scoring with his first home run this season, a
two-run drive off Octavio Dotel in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' 12-5 start is their best since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Florida 1--Greg Maddux pitched six innings, and Chipper
Jones hit a three-run homer to pull the Braves back up to .500 with a
victory at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (2-0), who left his last start after one inning with a
nagging back injury, gave up one run on five hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield, who had missed the last three games because of a
sprained wrist, was back in the lineup using a 31-ounce bat but went
0 for 4.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 7, New York 5--Brad Wilkerson hit a two-run homer and
Orlando Cabrera had an RBI double to cap a three-run fifth against
Shawn Estes (0-2) for the victory at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Before 11,464, the largest Olympic Stadium crowd since opening
night, Montreal took advantage of two errors by New York, which has
five in the series and a major league-leading 26 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Philadelphia 5--The Pirates turned sloppy infield
defense by the Phillies and Jack Wilson's three-run double into five
unearned runs and a 6-0 lead at Pittsburgh as they held on for their
fifth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Villone (2-2) pitched five shutout innings and Mike Williams
pitched the ninth for his eighth save.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Chicago 1--Juan Encarnacion drove in four runs and
Elmer Dessens (1-3) pitched 71/3 scoreless innings as the Reds
defeated the Cubs at Chicago.</TE>

<DH>Dodgers' Orosco, 45, Is Going Strong in 24th Season in
Majors</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heard the one about Dodger reliever Jesse Orosco being so old his
rookie card was a cave drawing? Or that Abner Doubleday was his first
manager? Or that....</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, I've probably heard them all by now," said Orosco, who
turns 45 today. "The guys like to joke around about how old I am, and
now everybody's having fun with the idea that I'm going to play until
I'm 50.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't bother me at all because it's all in good fun. They're
joking about me still being in the big leagues, and I'm glad I'm
still around so they can joke about it. Besides, it's true. I am
old."</LD>
<TE>   The major leagues' oldest player is still getting the job done,
relying on his seemingly ageless left arm while adding to baseball's
all-time appearance record and surprising doubters. Orosco is a key
member of the Dodger bullpen 23 years after making his major league
debut for the New York Mets in 1979, educating and inspiring
impressed teammates, including some young enough to be his son.</TE>
<TE>   He has faced many fathers and their sons, recalling encounters
with Bobby and Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. and Bob, Bret
and Aaron Boone. Such is life for a pitcher born when the Dodgers
still played at Ebbets Field who is the only player this season
eligible to start collecting his pension while receiving a salary.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco acknowledges he's an old story, but the Dodgers said it's
still good reading.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you something about Jesse Orosco," Manager Jim Tracy,
46, said recently. "I know how old this man is, and I know age is
something people like to focus on, but it doesn't mean anything in
the context of what this individual does on the baseball field for
the Los Angeles Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hand him the ball and you look in his eyes, and we're
talking about a guy in year No. 23 in the big leagues, you still see
the fire, you still see the passion and the desire to want to
compete. Other people can focus on age or whatever they want to, I
choose to look at what Jesse Orosco does on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Retiring left-handed batters is what the left-handed specialist
still does best. Left-handers are batting .182 against Orosco this
season and .219 since 1989. Orosco has recovered from 2000 elbow
surgery and it shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesse has just been throwing great," catcher Paul Lo Duca said.
"His slider and cutter are moving all over the place in the [strike]
zone, and his fastball has been hitting 87, 88 [mph] consistently. He
really didn't have his good fastball last year after the surgery, but
he does now and it makes a big difference</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to watch him work because he knows exactly what he
wants to do. He has so much experience and he's been in just about
every situation you can think of. Everybody respects him so much and
learns from him. I know I do."</TE>
<TE>   Orosco and 39-year-old teammate Terry Mulholland are proof there's
always room for lefties, though it's not that simple. Orosco did not
reach the majors' exclusive 40-year, four-decade club by simply being
a one-trick wonder.</TE>
<TE>   He repeatedly displays his mettle by thriving in tense late-inning
situations, winning where younger, harder throwers fail. Orosco's
mind is as much a part of his arsenal as his deceptive fastball,
late-breaking slider and sharp cutter, helping him gain the trust of
skeptical managers en route to a record 1,138 appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco has outlasted many decision-makers who told him he was
washed up long ago, reveling in every moment of the unexpectedly long
ride.</TE>
<TE>   The key to his longevity?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, one time on the [disabled list] in 23 years doesn't hurt,"
said Orosco, drafted in 1978 by the Minnesota Twins and traded to the
Mets in 1979 . "Consistency is the most important thing in this game,
and I've been there, just about every day, for my whole career.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had my share of ups and downs just like anybody, but overall
I've had more success than failure. As time went on, I started
learning more and more about hitters and what they're thinking. I
don't have an answer for everything, but I've learned a little bit
over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Meersand, Orosco's agent since he was drafted out of Santa
Barbara City College, said conditioning is the biggest factor.</TE>
<TE>   "His work ethic and his diet have been important," he said. "I
knew he would have a good career, but you never expect anybody to
play 23 years in the big leagues. You expect a guy to have some type
of break down, but he keeps himself in great shape.</TE>
<TE>   "He went on the [disabled list] for the first time in his career
in 2000. And that's something for someone who threw the way he did,
because you have to remember he was a big-time closer."</TE>
<TE>   Orosco, widely remembered for throwing his glove in the air after
recording the final out in the Mets' World Series-clinching Game 7
victory over the Boston Red Sox in 1986, had a career-high 31 saves
in 1984 and was selected to the National League All-Star team for the
second consecutive season. He has 141 career saves and a record of
84-76 with a 3.04 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Gagne is benefiting from Orosco's experience, receiving sage
tutoring in his first year as a closer.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesse has been a big help," said Gagne, off to a fast start in
his new job. "He's giving me tips and things to watch out for and I'm
just listening. It's good to have him around because he's been there
before. He's already done this."</TE>
<TE>   Orosco is enjoying his second season of his second stint with the
team, having also earned a World Series ring as a member of the 1988
club. He and his wife, Leticia, live year round in San Diego with
their three children, Jesse Jr., Natalia and Alyssa, and Orosco does
not want to play far from home. Or much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I've taken care of my family well, we have a nice place to live,
my kids are dressed well and they're getting a good education,"
Orosco said.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing this game is a dream come true, and I've played it longer
than I ever imagined I would, but eventually it ends for all of us."</TE>

<HD>Walker Proves to Be a Different Breed of Cat</HD>

<LD>A knick-knack in a row of porcelain, the Laker starting power forward
has recently been known less for his ability than his eccentricities.</LD>
<LD>   A.C. Green wore a bear on his head.</LD>
<LD>   Horace Grant wore the gaudiest set of eyewear this side of Elton
John.</LD>
<TE>   Which brings us to Samaki Walker, about whom little is known other
than, his face is on intimate terms with Kobe Bryant's fist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Los Angeles, man," Walker said with a laugh when reminded of
the publicity surrounding their bumpy midseason bus ride. "Anything
goes."</TE>
<TE>   The latest Laker corner piece is a pleasant sort, acutely aware of
the warmth found within the shadow of the two best players in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   But he also understands that, this time of year, the town and team
are dying for a reason to recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly beginning today in the first round of the playoffs
against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Especially with Rasheed Wallace on the court, and maybe Robert
Horry on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his hands full," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   And who exactly is he?</TE>
<TE>   Besides being a decent rebounder and defender prone to spells of
fouling and stubbornness?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Walker thought about being the bald guy.</TE>
<TE>   There was an idea initiated a couple of weeks ago that everyone
shave their heads, and Walker was ready.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the last minute, a couple of guys reneged," he said, and
we're obviously hoping that one of them was Mark Madsen.</TE>
<TE>   Then Walker thought about being the headband guy. He recently
began wearing one, and it looks quite sporting.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a nice little round head for it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But this team already has a headband guy, his name is Derek
Fisher, so Walker needs something else.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he has something else.</TE>
<TE>   But, perhaps appropriately, it's the one thing we can't see.</TE>
<TE>   It's under his jersey, snaking around his left breast over his
heart.</TE>
<TE>   A tattoo of a black panther.</TE>
<TE>   "The cheetah and the leopard get all the publicity, you never hear
about the panther," he said. "It's a low-key, ferocious animal."</TE>
<TE>   The only way fans will ever eye this symbol is if the Trail
Blazers are shirts, and the Lakers are skins, but usually it's the
Trail Blazers who are angrily tearing off their clothes.</TE>
<TE>   More likely is that Walker becomes known by using the same
relentless energy of those who trudged before him.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy legs and all, Grant was the veteran who last year was the
first to flip on that much-hyped switch, scoring 12 points in the
first quarter of the first game of the amazing playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   Fading skills and all, Green was the veteran who knew when to flip
that switch off, playing one of his best games in the last game of
the last series of the Lakers 2000 championship.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to tell whether Walker, 26, who has never won a
title at any level, can understand those moments.</TE>
<TE>   His statistics, for example, are more difficult to digest than the
offerings in Jackson's midseason book club.</TE>
<TE>   His increased minutes meant career highs in every important
category. He had 17 rebounds in one game, five blocked shots in
another, and recorded six double-doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Lakers were actually better when he didn't play, going
10-3 in games that he missed and going 48-21 when he showed up.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks like a center, which makes him an occasional good
replacement for Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   But when he's playing power forward, which is most of the time, it
makes him susceptible to the roaming, agile play of the conference's
best power forwards.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a big-man's mentality, but you need to be a lot more of a
shooter in this offense," Horry said. "So we're always kidding him to
move out more, to shoot more."</TE>
<TE>   He is the only player on the Lakers' postseason roster who did not
take a three-pointer during the season, keeping his career mark at a
perfect one for one.</TE>
<TE>   Fine, he doesn't have to imitate Horry. But a few more 15-footers
might be nice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to play outside more," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Both offensively and defensively, a sacrificial move that Walker
says suits him fine.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here, I left my ego on the table," he said. "This is
not about me. ... This is about winning a championship."</TE>
<TE>   Around here the last three years, nearly everybody who has said
that has meant it.</TE>
<TE>   We will, then, give Walker the benefit of the doubt. But we will
be watching.</TE>
<TE>   Hard to believe, especially on a team with such stars, but
everybody will be watching.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the spotlight," Walker said. "It's about doing
what you can to win."</TE>
<TE>   He certainly has the nerve for it. Who else would stand up to
Bryant in a dispute over a rebounding bet? Who else was unafraid to
irritate one of the team leaders enough that Bryant would punch him?</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe and I are fine, we talked it out, man to man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His next such conversation begins today, with Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Then, if all goes well, he'll be talking in a couple of weeks with
Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Then, eventually, we suspect the debate will rage with Chris
Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Which should bring Samaki Walker's attentions to the black panther
on his breast, a thoughtful, inspiring bit of symbolism in that it is
far less whacko than a bear on his head.</TE>

<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Team Major Taylor was booed and sued and left sponsorless. For the
last month Josh Weir, lead rider for Team Major Taylor, the fifth
all-minority team to qualify for the Little 500, the cycling race
immortalized in the 1979 movie "Breaking Away," has heard himself
called a cheater, a ringer, an outsider and some things that can't be
printed.</LD>
<LD>   Upon introduction Saturday at Indiana University's Bill Armstrong
Stadium, in front of a crowd of nearly 20,000, the riders of Team
Major Taylor were booed. After riding 197 laps, after being involved
in a dramatic crash and still finishing ninth, the riders of Team
Major Taylor were booed again.</LD>
<LD>   And yet this day was a triumph for Team Major Taylor, a team named
for an Indianapolis native, an African American cyclist who was
setting world records in the early 1900s but who died penniless. It
was a triumph for the Little 500, for Indiana University and for race
relations.</LD>
<TE>   For even while some drunken frat boys in the stands booed the
Taylor team after the race, riders from four other teams came to
Taylor's pit area to pat Weir on the back or shake the hand of Coach
Courtney Bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Though extra police had been commissioned to patrol the stadium in
response to rumors of trouble and threats against Team Major Taylor,
there was no need. The race ran cleanly, the fans behaved, most of
them, and the 33 racing teams were able to finish the race and shake
hands.</TE>
<TE>   In the stands behind Team Major Taylor were nearly 100 minority
fans who chanted "We'll be back," and meant it.</TE>
<TE>   "What we wanted to accomplish," Bishop said, "was this. To bring
new faces to this race and to this stadium. We did this for those
people." He pointed to the men, women, boys and girls who were
wearing Team Major Taylor T-shirts and who never had found reason to
come to this race in any of its previous 51 runnings.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't about winning but about opening doors and making an
impact," Bishop said. "I think we've done that. And we will be back."</TE>
<TE>   The last time an all-minority team competed, it finished last and
was never a threat. That was in 1992 and one of the riders was
Bishop, a New Yorker, an African American, a man proud of both his
heritage and his school.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Bishop, now an Indianapolis businessman, has dreamed
of putting together another minority team, one that would be
competitive and not only a token presence. With the Indiana Black
Alumni Foundation raising money, Bishop went around the country
recruiting the best minority cyclists he could find.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't hard to find them," Bishop said. "It's not a big pool."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop was able to offer the cyclists full scholarships to
Indiana. In return, the cyclists had to commit to training hard for
the Little 500.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the recruits, like Rahsaan Bahati, a graduate of Crenshaw
High, had already accomplished too much as amateur riders to be
eligible for the race. So Bahati came to IU for the scholarship and
to help train the racers.</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying was in March. In something of an upset, Team Major
Taylor, a team of four freshmen, qualified third out of 33 teams. The
format of the race is like the Indy 500--11 rows of three teams. So
Team Major Taylor had earned a front-row position and a month of
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   After qualifying, the Indiana University Student Foundation
(IUSF), which runs the race, announced that Weir was ineligible.
According to the IUSF, an anonymous complaint had been filed saying
that Weir had at one time been classified a Category 1 rider by USA
Cycling. To be eligible for the Little 500, cyclists had to be
Category 3 or lower. According to the paperwork Weir filed, he was
now a Category 3 racer.</TE>
<TE>   Team Major Taylor and the IUSF agreed to abide by the decision of
a three-person university arbitration panel. After reviewing the
evidence, the arbitrators unanimously voted to allow Weir and Team
Major Taylor to compete. A day after this decision was announced, the
IUSF said it had received further information from USA Cycling that
led it to believe Weir was ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   University officials said the arbitration decision was final.
Riders from other teams weren't so quick to accept that answer. On
Wednesday, during a final training run, and after the pace car had
led the 33 teams around one lap, 32 teams laid down their bikes and
refused to practice with Team Major Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Friday afternoon two riders--Kevin Vanes of Acacia fraternity and
Todd Cornelius of Phi Gamma Delta--filed a lawsuit alleging Weir
knowingly misled the arbitration panel about his previous riding
experience and asked a judge to bar Weir from riding in Saturday's
race. A circuit judge dismissed the suit without a hearing after a
single conversation with the plaintiff's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning McDonald's, the sponsor of Team Major Taylor,
withdrew its support. According to a person close to Team Major
Taylor, McDonald's said that if Weir raced, it would no longer be a
sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's representatives were unavailable but Team Major
Taylor's four riders had black masking tape covering up the
"McDonald's" on the front of their red racing jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe I did everything by the rules," Weir said after the
race. "The IUSF had all my paperwork in August. Why was nothing
questioned until after we did well in qualifying? I don't want to say
race was part of anything but you do have to wonder."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bahati: "Someone's gonna make a movie about this."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, someone has.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking Away" was about the Cutters, a team of locals who loved
bike racing and attended IU while living at home because they
couldn't afford to live on campus. The fraternities who had dominated
the race did everything they could to keep the Cutters out of the
Little 500. This being a movie, the Cutters fought their way in. And
they've stayed. . They've won six times, and Cutter Coach Jim
Kirkham, a rider on the winning 1992 Cutters team, was quick to find
Bishop after the race.</TE>
<TE>   "You make sure and come back next year," Kirkham told Bishop.
"Don't let the controversy keep you out. Otherwise they win and you
lose. I want to see you next year."</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Wardell, a senior and an executive director of the Central
Black Student Union, said she and many African American students felt
Weir had been unfairly scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   "Although riders have been disqualified before, Josh and Team
Major Taylor were highly scrutinized because they performed so well
at qualifications. Some felt threatened by their presence and wanted
to find ways to eliminate the entire team," Wardell said. She said
the fact the IUSF refused to abide by the original decision of the
arbitration panel was evidence that race was an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ihnen, head of the IUSF, said that in the last seven years 13
cyclists had been ruled ineligible to compete. "Every year we have 10
or 15 people we have questions about. We do checks to make sure
everyone is being honest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ihnen said he wouldn't comment on Weir's participation. He did say
he fully supported the decision last Wednesday of 32 teams to lay
down their bikes and not ride the practice laps. "When you take a
group of 19-, 20-, 21-year-old guys and get that many to agree on a
particular issue, that says something about the issue," Ihnen said.</TE>
<TE>   As Team Major Taylor accepted congratulations from some of its
fans and took photos with Miss IU, two members of another team walked
by. One said to the other, "Bet they won't be back. They won't get
away with cheating next year."</TE>
<TE>   "But we will be back and we'll be better," Bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark my words," Kirkham said. "If Team Major Taylor keeps coming
back, it's going to win this thing. And won't that be something?"</TE>

<HD>The Situation Is Getting a Little Hairy for Kings</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>I didn't exactly think it was news when the wife told me she's not
going to be sleeping with ZZ Top any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   But I was surprised to learn how upset she was with the Kings
being down 2-0 to Colorado in the playoffs. You live with a woman for
almost 30 years, and not once was there a hint she was as big a
hockey fan as I am.</LD>
<LD>   "Things just didn't go well in Denver," I said, "and I'm sure
there will be a warm reception at home." That's when she mentioned
the couch, and the fact it opens into a bed, and I could see that if
she were married to Andy Murray, but why me?</LD>
<TE>   "Rip Van Winkle," she said with disgust, and while I've never gone
more than two or three days without shaving before, I realized as she
continued to talk that she thought I wasn't going to shave again
until the Kings won the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I EXPLAINED the beard will come off when the Kings are eliminated
from the playoffs--if they don't win the Stanley Cup this year. I
also told her about the uncanny resemblance now to Sean Connery and
how exciting that might be when I get home, but I guess her cell
phone battery went dead.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I was here for the Kings on Saturday in the Pepsi Center,
and very pleased to see Murray had listened to my advice and was now
starting the game with center Jason "Shaq" Allison on the ice. I
sometimes wonder how these guys made it to the playoffs, what with
all the games I missed this season.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said I had it all wrong when I wrote that Allison had been
on the ice for only 20 seconds in the first six minutes the other
night. He said Allison stepped on the ice immediately after the puck
had been dropped, and skated on three of the team's first seven
shifts.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously we weren't watching the same game. But I will say this,
there are great pretzels in the rear of the Pepsi Center press box,
and this is a good reason why they should have someone delivering the
free food to the sportswriters rather than making them get up and
miss some of the action.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is free at Staples Center, of course, so that won't be a
problem Monday or Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BASED ON my experience as a hockey writer, I had a pretty good
hunch early on the Kings were going to lose. Ian Laperriere, who is
supposedly one of our guys, just hauled off and took a shot at our
own goalie. Felix Potvin made a great save, but he had to be a little
disheartened later when Laperriere had a wide-open shot at Colorado's
net, and never came close to goalie Patrick Waugh, the net or the
same zip code.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings went up, 2-1, because Laperriere was on the bench. The
officials called two penalties on our guys so the Avalanche could tie
the score. Then my man Allison scored, and while I'm sure he pointed
upstairs to thank me for inspiring him, I'd run out of pretzels a few
minutes earlier. I'm told his goal was really something to see.</TE>
<TE>   I did get the chance to see what it must be like to watch Tim
Salmon try to hit the ball. The puck was sliding in front of Potvin,
and my man Allison and Colorado's Peter Forsberg were there.</TE>
<TE>   Allison took a Salmon-like swing, whiffed and the puck rolled off
Potvin, giving Allison another fat pitch to hit, and once again he
missed. Forsberg then popped it into the net to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Allison slammed his stick into the ice in disgust, knowing I
probably would liken him to Salmon in the morning newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE AVALANCHE finished the scoring, and later Allison and Murray
said the same thing: The Kings are stupid.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be smarter," Allison said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little critical of some of our decision-making," Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   Like what? "Like giving the puck to a black jersey rather than a
white," he said. "The odds improve when you pass the puck to someone
on your own team."</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to think they will be able to work that out by Monday
night, although it could be confusing if the Kings change to their
black sweaters at home.</TE>
<TE>   They also might want to point Laperriere in the right direction,
because sooner or later I fear he might get one past Potvin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEVERAL KINGS' fans were quick to e-mail and say King President
Tim LIE-weke, pardon, Leiweke, stood up at the "State of the
Franchise" gathering and said, "T.J. Simers is an idiot." I asked
Leiweke if he said that, and he couldn't remember. The e-mailers said
it was accurate, but I don't think they were referring to who said
it, as much as what was said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS a time there when Ray and Claire Nowland said they found
humor in this space, and while they certainly didn't want their
neighbors to know that, apparently it helped Claire as she dealt with
small cell lung cancer. Ray tells me Claire is no longer with us,
thereby cutting my readership in half, and making me more upset that
I never had the honor to meet such a brave woman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Michele Holiday:</TE>
<TE>   "It is a good thing most Kings fans have no idea what you look
like, otherwise you probably wouldn't even make it to the front door
of the arena without having rotten eggs and tomatoes thrown at you. I
can't understand why the Kings' management let you near the players.
You're a negative, mindless, spineless, jelly fish of a journalist
and I'd be honored to be the first fan to let you have it in the
kisser. You have no idea what you're writing about when it comes to
hockey because the Colorado goaltender is Patrick ROY! Not WAUGH."</TE>
<TE>   Hockey readers are so smart--you can't slip anything past them.</TE>

<LD>   None of those ladies or any of the other heroines of a race that
was first run in 1935 did what Astra accomplished Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-year-old Theatrical mare became the first two-time winner of
the Santa Barbara, defending her title by turning the tables on 9-10
favorite Golden Apples, who had beaten her soundly in last month's
Santa Ana Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and trained by Laura
De Seroux, the 2-1 second choice sat close to the slow pace, went
after leader Polaire, who raced coupled in the wagering with Golden
Apples, then kicked away in the final sixteenth.</TE>
<TE>   In winning by two lengths, she completed the 11/4 miles on turf in
2:012/5 under jockey Kent Desormeaux.</TE>
<TE>   It was the ninth victory in 13 starts for Astra, but her first for
DeSeroux. She had previously been trained by Simon Bray, but was
transferred to her new home after finishing last over a yielding
course as the 7-10 favorite in the Beverly D. on Aug. 18 at Arlington
Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Able to beat only Danthebluegrassman when finishing seventh in the
Santa Anita Derby 15 days ago, Proud Citizen earned a trip to the
Kentucky Derby with a wire-to-wire victory in the $364,650 Lexington
Stakes at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing a hot streak at the Kentucky track for trainer Wayne
Lukas, the 3-year-old Gone West colt, an 8-1 longshot, won by a
little more than three lengths in 1:442/5 for the 11/16 miles over a
track moistened by rain.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Mike Smith, Proud Citizen, who had only a Belmont Park
maiden victory in five previous starts, became Lukas' second
Lexington winner in four years. In 1999, Charismatic, who had
finished fourth in the Santa Anita Derby, won the Lexington before
winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "You know me, I've been planning this for three months," Lukas
said. "I'm probably the only guy that would use the Santa Anita Derby
for a prep. When we ran him there, I told the owners [Bill Mack, Bob
Baker and David Cornstein] that we were making a quantum leap, but
we'd protect him and point him here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Mabee, 80, one of the founding members of the 32-year-old Del
Mar Thoroughbred Club and a prominent owner-breeder in California for
many years, remains at an Escondido hospital after suffering a stroke
a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He's off the respirator," said his son, Larry Mabee. "He's
resting quietly. He suffered a severe stroke and the outlook is
bleak."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. was given a three-day suspension,
beginning Thursday, for an incident in Friday's fifth race.</TE>
<TE>   Pincay was cited for "crossing over without sufficient clearance"
early in the six-furlong race. Pickled Bay finished second and no
inquiry was conducted.</TE>

<LD>After 85 days and 734 races, Santa Anita will put a cap on its
winter-spring meet this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Before the thoroughbred scene shifts to Hollywood Park on
Wednesday, the Arcadia track will present two stakes, topped by the
$400,000 San Juan Capistrano Invitational Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Although it retains its Grade I status, the Capistrano, which is
run at about 13/4 miles on the turf, has lost significance in recent
years and the field for the 2002 renewal is not particularly strong.</LD>
<TE>   Cagney, who finished fifth when tried on the dirt for only the
second time in his career in the Santa Anita Handicap on March 2,
could be the one to beat, getting back on his preferred surface.</TE>
<TE>   Continental Red, a consistent performer for owner-breeders Wes and
Susan Fitzpatrick and trainer Ian Jory, will attempt to become the
14th horse to win both the San Luis Rey Stakes and San Juan
Capistrano in the same year.</TE>
<TE>   Single Empire was the last to sweep the two races, accomplishing
the feat for trainer Neil Drysdale in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Quality sprinter Swept Overboard will make his
first start of the year in the $125,000 San Simeon Handicap at about
61/2 furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Kent Desormeaux. The jockey won three races on Friday's
card, then added two more victories on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Fox Sports. The network's decision to drop the "Santa
Anita Live" program, a fixture for years on its cable outlets, is a
bad one. The show has always been well done and it will be missed.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Don't Ignore Her, Secret
Dream and Kimora in the second, singling Run Rate in the third and
using Bin Dere Did Dat, Cellular Call, Literal Prowler and Saint Wynn
in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/230. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $19.60/$1,332.60. Total money bet: $1,448.</TE>

<HD>Murray Says It's Time to Start Wising Up</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Kings also lost their first two playoff games last season, but
Coach Andy Murray said he sees few similarities between the club's
situation last April and the one it faces today, trailing the
Colorado Avalanche.</LD>
<LD>   "We came back from Detroit last year down, 2-0, and we hadn't
competed," Murray said Saturday after the Kings' 5-3 loss. "We hadn't
played hard.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a major adjustment that had to be made on our hockey club
for us to have a chance to come back in that series. I don't think
there's a major adjustment that has to be made here."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings, Murray said, simply need to play smarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't question our heart or our determination," he said. "I
don't question our physical play, or our commitment. I'm just a
little critical of some of the decisions we're making. But obviously
we're playing a great team. We recognize that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh, traded to the Kings last season in the deal that
sent All-Star defenseman Rob Blake to the Avalanche, asked by
reporters why he hadn't purchased Blake's oceanfront home in
Manhattan Beach: "I've got to score a lot more goals before I can
afford that."</TE>
<TE>   Blake made $9 million this season, Deadmarsh $2.75 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first two periods of Game 2, the Kings' No. 1 line of
Jason Allison, Deadmarsh and Ziggy Palffy did their best to keep pace
with Colorado's dominating top two lines. For every Avalanche goal
scored by the lines headed by Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg, the Kings
answered with a score from either Deadmarsh or Allison. But that all
changed in the third period, when Colorado blanked the Kings and
limited them to six shots on goal.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while we gave them too much space there because they have
three great players," Sakic said. "But we tied their line up a little
more in the third period once we got the lead."</TE>

<HD>SCOUTING REPORT</HD>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>STARTERS</LD>
<LD>   In the minds of enough NBA people, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant are the two best players in the sport. It's a decent-sized
trip from there to the other three Laker starters, and the worn knock
on the Lakers is their lack of depth, but they've held up for two
championships in a row now, maybe going on three. A hale O'Neal
cannot be defended, and Bryant, while still maturing, has acquired a
degree of selflessness at 23. Rasheed Wallace averaged 19.3 points
and 8.2 rebounds against most of the league, 24 points and 10.3
rebounds against the Lakers. Bonzi Wells is the kind of athlete who
bothers the Lakers, as well. But, while Scottie Pippen is sage and a
veteran of numerous playoff battles, he has been harmless against the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Edge: Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   BENCH</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson, not good enough to be a Laker 21/2 years ago, was
the difference in the two regular-season games won by the Trail
Blazers, as much for his defense on Bryant as for his hell-bent
effort around the basket. He never stops talking, a tendency the
Trail Blazers find endearing and the Lakers find annoying, the basic
qualifications of teammates versus foes. He also never stops playing,
and so is the primary reason Bryant made 44% of his field-goal
attempts against Portland, compared to 47.1% against the rest of the
league. Portland added center Chris Dudley to its playoff roster, in
part for the six fouls he brings against O'Neal. The Lakers counter
off the bench with Robert Horry, who averaged 10.3 points and made
seven of 16 three-point attempts in four games--one of them a
start--against the Trail Blazers, and Devean George, an athletic
defender against the athletic Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Though O'Neal, their top scorer, sat out 15 games, the Lakers
ranked third in the league in scoring and sixth in field-goal
percentage. The Trail Blazers were 11th in scoring and ninth in
field-goal percentage. The Lakers run what is supposed to be an
equal-opportunity offense, but O'Neal and Bryant get the large
percentage of the shots. O'Neal led the league in shooting percentage
for the fifth consecutive season and the sixth time in his 10-year
career. After a strong first half, during which he made nearly half
of his attempts, Bryant finished at 46.9%, still the best shooting
percentage of his career. Derek Fisher pressed his offense in the
second half and, as a three-point shooter, has become worrisome for
defenses. Wallace, when focused, is one of the best scoring power
forwards in the game. Wells is aggressive, particularly from the
perimeter, where he hurt the Lakers with two three-pointers last
Sunday in Portland. From his role as a point forward, Pippen runs the
offense at least as well as Damon Stoudamire.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the talk about defensive meltdowns, and there were
quite a few, the Lakers held their opponents to a field-goal
percentage of 42.4, lowest in the league and well below their numbers
from last season. That being said, they also gave up 94.1 points per
game, high considering the shooting percentage. The reason: The
Lakers gave up nearly 83 shots per game, 10th-most in the league.
That's plenty of second and third chances, and that means not enough
defensive rebounds for a team that's best in its slow-down,
half-court offense. O'Neal is not as active defensively when his toe
is throbbing, and that allows more penetration than usual. How
limited was O'Neal? Memphis rookie Pau Gasol blocked more shots per
game. The Trail Blazers gave up 93.7 points per game. Wallace and
Dale Davis are shot blockers, but not against O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Cheeks, who was in 133 playoff games as a player, will
coach his first one today. Phil Jackson, who played in 67, will coach
his 192nd today. He has been the coach for eight of the last 10 NBA
champions, six in Chicago and the last two in Los Angeles. It hasn't
hurt that he's handed the basketball to either Michael Jordan or
Shaquille O'Neal in every one, but his been-there-done-that cool
invariably spills over to his players.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   KEY TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   The schedule. As long as the NBA and NBC insist on airing out the
schedule to near football-like proportions, O'Neal can ease on and
off the anti-inflammatories, and his toe will recover, and his wrist
will be strong. The series goes Sunday-Thursday-Sunday-Wednesday.
There is so much time between games, the Trail Blazers were planning
on returning to Portland between Games 1 and 2, and the Lakers were
considering doing the same between Games 3 and 4, assuming the fourth
game is necessary. The Lakers are the veteran team and are more
likely to benefit from the down time.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   PREDICTION</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers in 3.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Power forward Robert Horry, who missed parts of the Lakers' last two
regular-season games because of bleeding beneath his abdomen, is
expected to play today against the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   While the club's official statement was that Horry remained
questionable for the game, Horry and Coach Phil Jackson both said
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "We anticipate he's going to be able to play," Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   The task now is gauging Horry's minutes, and whether fatigue will
make him more vulnerable to re-injury.</TE>
<TE>   Horry averaged 10.3 points and 5.8 rebounds in four regular-season
games against the Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If this is Lakers vs. Trail Blazers, then that must be Kobe vs.
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant tries to score, Ruben Patterson defends him
aggressively, and then everybody talks about it. Ruben, especially.</TE>
<TE>   The question was if Bryant would play to prove Patterson wrong,
which the Trail Blazers would love.</TE>
<TE>   "Not so much to prove him wrong," Bryant said. "He knows he's
wrong. I don't think there's one person who believes they can stop
me."</TE>
<TE>   While granting Patterson "challenges me very well," Bryant grew
weary of the conversation by the second or third question.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's silly," he said. "He's a good defender. Like I said,
there's certain possessions he gets the better of me. There are
possessions I get the better of him."</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, would Patterson believe he is the Kobe Stopper?</TE>
<TE>   Bryant shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The paranoia was plenty thick in the Trail Blazer locker room
Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   During a short media access period, assistant coach Dan Panaggio
accused a reporter of studying the plays he was drawing on a large
board in black marker, and ordered the reporter to turn his back.</TE>
<TE>   When the reporter--one of about three dozen milling around in the
locker room, and engaged with Scottie Pippen in an
interview--refused, Panaggio appeared to become angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Stop looking!" he snapped. "You're looking at our plays! Look the
other way! Look the other way!"</TE>
<TE>   OK then.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, according to the secret board, at some point in
today's game Pippen is going to pass the ball to Rasheed Wallace, who
is going to shoot it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, on the Kobe Stopper: "Kobe doesn't spend his days
talking about Ruben. I'd like to see [Patterson] stop him from coming
to the games. That would impress me. Kobe keeps coming to the games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox, on how Horry looked in Saturday's light practice: "He needs a
haircut. Other than that he looks pretty good."</TE>

<LD>Fans of jockey Alex Bautista will have plenty of opportunities to
wager on their favorite rider tonight at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Bautista, who is winning at better than a 20% clip through the
first 64 nights of the season, is scheduled to ride in eight of the
nine races.</LD>
<LD>   Most of his mounts are serious contenders, including Shoot N Shine
in the eighth at 870 yards. The Texas-bred drew the rail in the field
of eight and goes for his second win at the meet. He won for Bautista
on Feb. 24.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Quick N Sweet. 2. Making Amends. 3. Flyndoll. 4.
Dark Shaat. 5. Cagey Cameron. 6. World Of Fun. 7. Be Bop Jazz. 8.
Shoot N Shine. 9. Hugo Rules.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Let's single World Of Fun in the sixth, use Be Bop Jazz, How
Bee Zar and GW Fancy Noble Chick in the seventh, Shoot N Shine and
Reeking Havoc in the eighth and Hugo Rules, Rio Cheng and Wizard Of
Easton in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the first race, Salade Nicoise is a new face
debuting in a bad race for a winning barn (Christopher O'Dell) and
Defrere R.N. is the longer price of trainer Chuck Treece's two
entrants in the third.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Sets Pace, Nets Lose Game 1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In less than two hours, the Indiana Pacers took away what the New
Jersey Nets spent five months building.</LD>
<LD>   Jermaine O'Neal's offense, Ron Artest's defense and Reggie
Miller's playoff experience helped the Pacers steal home-court
advantage from the Nets.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal scored all but two of his 30 points in the first three
quarters, Artest came up with three steals in a 90-second span of the
fourth quarter, and Miller scored six clutch points down the stretch
to lead Indiana past New Jersey, 89-83, Saturday in Game 1 of their
first-round playoff series at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   Making its first postseason appearance in four years, New Jersey
was unable to establish the up-tempo style that worked so well during
the regular season. The Pacers turned the game into a matchup of
half-court offenses, and Indiana's was superior.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal showed off his inside-outside repertoire and outscored
Kenyon Martin, 30-15, at the power forward position. Indiana's Brad
Miller contributed 18 points and 12 rebounds, while the Nets got just
seven points from centers Todd MacCulloch and Jason Collins.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey couldn't get its perimeter game going, shooting just
two for 11 on three-point shots, and finished with just 12 assists on
35 field goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get out and run," Net guard Jason Kidd said. "We walked
the ball up--even on misses--and that's not one of our strengths."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had 26 points, nine assists and eight rebounds for New
Jersey, but the Nets didn't get anything special from anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 80, Orlando 79--Having to carry the offensive load after
Jamal Mashburn was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms, Baron Davis
scored 28 points and had a key steal with three seconds remaining to
seal the Hornets' win at Charlotte, N.C., in Game 1 of their playoff
series.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn, Charlotte's leading scorer at 21.5 points a game,
started the game but left late in the first quarter and was taken to
a hospital by ambulance for overnight observation.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady led the Magic with 20 points but made just eight for
21 from the field and didn't get off a last-second shot attempt,
thanks to Davis' steal.</TE>

<KH>WESTERN CONFERENCE ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Webber Sets Road Block for Jazz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Webber got away with a late mistake. Scott Padgett didn't.</LD>
<LD>   Webber had 24 points and 12 rebounds and blocked a late
three-point shot by Padgett after missing a clinching free throw as
the top-seeded Sacramento Kings held off Utah, 89-86, Saturday at
Sacramento in Game 1 of their best-of-five series.</LD>
<LD>   Despite forecasts of a lopsided matchup, the Jazz did nearly
everything it needed to do to steal a victory from the Kings, who had
beaten Utah decisively in four regular-season games.</LD>
<TE>   "This wasn't a wake-up call," Webber said. "We knew they were
going to play aggressive. We knew we could be in for a tough game in
this first one. I was just glad to get it out of our system."</TE>
<TE>   Webber made a free throw with 7.1 seconds to go, providing the
final margin, but also gave the Jazz a final chance by missing the
second.</TE>
<TE>   After a timeout, Padgett inbounded to Karl Malone, who passed it
back to Padgett. His three-point try was blocked by Webber but the
ball went to John Stockton, whose three-point shot bounced high off
the rim and was coming back down when Padgett got a hand on the ball
and tried to slam it through.</TE>
<TE>   Padgett had no reason to touch the ball because the Jazz needed
three points. He was called for offensive goaltending with 0.3
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to do it all over again, I probably wouldn't have gone
for it," Padgett said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz was swept by the Kings, 4-0, in the regular season,
losing by more than 20 points three times. But Utah was in this one
to the end, with Malone scoring 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bibby scored 20 points for the Kings, who finished the season
with a franchise-record 61 victories to secure the No. 1 seed in the
Western Conference and home-court advantage through the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   There was little reason to expect Utah could keep it close, yet
the Jazz did just that with a 45-38 rebounding advantage and by
outhustling the Kings with a 19-1 edge on second-chance points.</TE>
<TE>   The 175-pound Stockton bumped into 260-pound Vlade Divac in the
lane in the third quarter, sending the big man flying, Stockton and
Bibby had a wrestling scrum at midcourt and Bibby banged with Bryon
Russell, limping away with a sore left shin.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it was going to be physical, but we didn't know we would
struggle," Divac said. "We played terrible and they had a chance to
win but didn't. I don't think that's going to happen again."</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 110, Seattle 89--How hot did the Spurs get in their
playoff opener against Seattle in the Alamodome?</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied at halftime and the Spurs led by 25 points
after three quarters. The SuperSonics shot a more-than-respectable
51% and still got buried.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan recorded the second triple-double of his career and
rookie point guard Tony Parker scored 21 points to lead the Spurs.
Game 2 in the best-of-five series is Monday night at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan had 21 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists and five blocked
shots in 37 minutes. The Spurs pulled away by making 15 of 20 shots
in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively we turned it up," Duncan said. "We got a couple of
turnovers and really started running the ball. Got the ball up the
floor and didn't let them set their defense."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs played most of the game without center David Robinson,
who left late in the first quarter when his sore back tightened up.
He was scheduled for an MRI exam Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't feel too good," said Spur Coach Gregg Popovich. "David
never says if something is killing him. He came out of the game and
gave me that look, that was telling for me. If he's healthy he'll
come back and play because we need him."</TE>

<HD>Leonard Makes Run, Sets Record</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making up for years of frustration at Harbour Town, Justin Leonard
shot a five-under-par 66 Saturday to break the WorldCom Classic's
54-hole scoring record at Hilton Head Island, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard, who has never finished higher than 30th in the event and
thought about skipping the tournament, has thrived on the Harbour
Town's tight, tree-lined fairways and small greens.</LD>
<LD>   He had seven birdies and two bogeys for a 16-under 197 total,
bettering the mark of 198 set by Hale Irwin in 1994 and tied by Loren
Roberts two years later.</LD>
<TE>   "Fifty-four-hole records are great," said Leonard, who had a
three-stroke lead. "But we want to have 72-hole records."</TE>
<TE>   He needs a 68 to tie Roberts' record of 265, set en route to the
1996 title. That's more than Leonard's shot (67-64-66) in three
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard led Cameron Beckman by three strokes. Phil Mickelson, who
matched Jack Nicklaus' 1975 scoring mark for the first two rounds,
faded to a one-over 72 and was tied with Heath Slocum (66), four
shots behind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristie Kerr put herself in position for her first LPGA Tour
title, shooting a five-under 67 to take a five-stroke lead in the
Longs Drugs Challenge at Lincoln, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Kerr had an 11-under 205 total on the Twelve Bridges course.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin wide receiver Lee Evans, who elected to stay for his
senior season instead of making himself available for this weekend's
NFL draft, injured his left knee in the Badgers' spring game on
Saturday. Coach Barry Alvarez said Evans had ligament damage and
might need surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Polish-born Dariusz Michalczewski of Germany improved to 46-0 when
he knocked out Joey de Grandis of the United States in the second
round at Gdansk, Poland, to defend his World Boxing Organization
light-heavyweight title for the 21st time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe Calzaghe of Wales improved to 33-0 and retained his WBO
super-middleweight title with a unanimous 12-round decision over
American Charles Brewer at Cardiff, Wales.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The No. 2-ranked UCLA men's tennis team lost, 5-2, to No. 19
California in Berkeley on Saturday but still won the Pacific 10
Conference regular-season title with a 6-1 record. Cal (5-2) moved
into a second-place tie with Stanford and USC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ice Dogs lost to the visiting Fresno Falcons, 4-1, at Long
Beach. Their best-of-five West Coast Hockey League playoff series is
tied at 2-2, with the deciding game today at 4 at the Long Beach

<HD>Two Bruins Go Separate Ways</HD>
<DH>Football: Thomas is drafted by powerhouse Rams in first
round. Three picks later, Foster goes to lowly Panthers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA TELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>St. Louis and Charlotte, N.C., are separated by about 700 miles, but
on the football map, they're worlds apart.</LD>
<LD>   The Rams, last season's NFC champions, are one of the best teams
in the NFL, while the Panthers won all of two games in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The teams gained some common ground Saturday when St. Louis
selected UCLA linebacker Robert Thomas in the first round and the
Panthers took UCLA running back DeShaun Foster in the second round.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas was the 31st pick overall; Foster was the 34th.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that St. Louis was interested in me and if I was going to
go in the first round, that St. Louis was my hope," Thomas said.
"[With] three minutes left on the clock, they called me and said,
'Are you ready to be a Ram?' I said 'Yes I am.'"</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot, 230-pound linebacker joins a young defense that made
vast improvement in 2001. The Rams expect Thomas to fit into their
system after the departure of linebacker London Fletcher, who signed
with the Buffalo Bills.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a fast defense, and I'll fit in well because I'm a fast
player myself," Thomas said. "My success comes from my quickness and
from reading the offense."</TE>
<TE>   Along with first-round selection comes pressure to perform. But
Thomas, whose older brother Stan was a first-round pick of Chicago in
1991, said he is ready.</TE>
<TE>   "They've paid a lot money for me, and I've got to go in and make
something happen," Thomas said. "I'm going to go out there and help
the team as much as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Foster joins a Carolina backfield that already includes Lamar
Smith, a former 1,000-yard rusher signed by the Panthers in the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Foster's tendency to fumble may have hurt his draft stock and he
wants to use the criticism to his advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "It might have hurt me a little bit, but I still got drafted,"
Foster said. "I can still prove to teams that it's not an issue. I
can use it as a motivation factor."</TE>
<TE>   Foster, who was born in Charlotte and has relatives there, looks
forward to this next chapter of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Carolina is kind of lacking in the run game, but I'm hoping to
get it going," Foster said. "I'm going to go in, run hard and help
take a little [pressure] off [quarterback Chris] Weinke."</TE>
<TE>   Foster, 6 feet 1 and 215 pounds, was the third running back taken
in the draft, with William Green going to Cleveland with the 16th
pick and T.J. Duckett going to Atlanta with the 18th pick. Thomas was
the second linebacker taken behind Northwestern's Napoleon Harris,
who was selected 23rd by Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas and Foster were the Bruins' cornerstones for most of the
2001 season. Thomas finished with 111 tackles, 26 for losses, and
61/2 sacks and was named Pacific 10 defensive player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Foster played only seven games but still gained 1,109 yards and
averaged 5.1 yards a carry before being suspended for an NCAA
extra-benefits violation in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll think about it as long as I play football," Foster said. "I
should have thought before I acted. It's a mistake that I'll have to
live with for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   USC cornerback Kris Richard was selected by the Seattle Seahawks
in the third round, 85th overall. The 5-11, 190-pound cornerback
hopes to see action in Seattle's nickel and dime pass-coverage
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA safety Marques Anderson was taken in the third round by Green
Bay, 92nd overall.</TE>
<TE>   Washington defensive tackle Larry Triplett was picked up in the
second round, 42nd overall, by the Indianapolis Colts. Triplett, who
graduated from Westchester High, joins one of the NFL's most porous
defenses.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State lineman Chester Pitts, who attended California
Academy of Math and Science in Carson but didn't play football there,
was drafted by the Houston Texans in the second round, the 50th
overall pick. Pitts, who played tackle for the Aztecs, will probably
be moved to left guard.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sean Burke stopped his playoff struggles by stopping almost
everything the San Jose Sharks threw at him.</LD>
<LD>   Burke made 27 saves to earn only his third playoff victory since
his 1988 rookie season, and Daniel Briere scored his second goal in
two games as the Phoenix Coyotes evened their first-round series at a
game apiece, beating the Sharks, 3-1, Saturday at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Shane Doan had a goal and an assist, Denis Pederson had two
assists and Daymond Langkow scored the first goal for Phoenix. The
Coyote franchise hasn't won a playoff series since the Winnipeg Jets
made the conference semifinals in 1987.</LD>
<TE>   With managing partner Wayne Gretzky cheering from a luxury box,
Phoenix grabbed home-ice advantage entering Game 3 on Monday at
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who was 2-10 in the playoffs before the game, came within a
few minutes of his first postseason shutout in 14 years, giving up
only a rebound goal by Marco Sturm with 5:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes also got a boost from the return of captain and top
defenseman Teppo Numminen, who sat out Game 1 because of a broken
left foot.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, the Coyotes took their first lead
of the series when Langkow got up from a crushing check by Owen Nolan
and headed for the net, where he put a rebound of Doan's shot past
Evgeni Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   Briere got the Coyotes' second goal during a power play early in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   He did it with a spectacular end-to-end rush, shaking a defender
at the blue line and firing a clean wrist shot past Nabokov.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 2, Chicago 0--Brent Johnson stopped 26 shots to help the
Blues win at St. Louis to even their first-round playoff series at a
game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues, who felt they weren't aggressive enough in crashing the
net during a 2-1 loss in Game 1, scored both goals on rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Weight jammed in a rebound 2:53 into the game for his first
playoff goal as a Blue. Scott Mellanby scored the second goal midway
through the third period, knocking in his second rebound shot off of
Keith Tkachuk's initial shot.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, New York Islanders 0--Curtis Joseph made 31 saves to
help the Maple Leafs win at Toronto to take a 2-0 series lead.
Joseph, who earned his 13th career playoff shutout, played in only
his third game since breaking a bone in his left hand on Feb. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Alyn McCauley scored at 3:10 of the third period--getting assists
from Mats Sundin and Tie Domi, who scored the go-ahead goal in
Thursday's victory--and Tomas Kaberle added an empty-netter.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 3, Philadelphia 0--Patrick Lalime had 33 saves and won his
first playoff game to lead the Senators at Philadelphia, evening the
first-round series at a game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Alfredsson, Mike Fisher and former Flyer Jody Hull scored
for the Senators, who had 13 consecutive postseason road losses and
seven in a row overall.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Forsberg Providing the Power</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The way Peter Forsberg played against the Kings in Colorado's 5-3
victory Saturday, one would think he was the best player in the
history of hockey.</LD>
<LD>   Forsberg finished with one goal and two assists, giving him five
points over the first two games of the best-of-seven series. Not bad
for a player who sat out nearly a year because of various injuries
before rejoining the Avalanche for their Western Conference
first-round matchup against the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "My legs were going a little better [than they did in Game 1], so
it's a step in the right direction," said Forsberg, who had four
shots on goal, four hits and two takeaways in 15 minutes and 51
seconds of ice time, six seconds longer than he played Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "The first game was tough because it was the first in a long time
for me. But I'm not getting excited about my play. It was just the
second game. I still have a lot of kinks to work out."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just Forsberg's point production that gave the Kings
fits Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Proving once again that he's one of the most dominating power
forwards ever, Forsberg used his solid 6-foot, 205-pound body to draw
two penalties in six seconds, setting up a 5-on-3 power-play goal by
Joe Sakic, which tied the score at 2-2 late in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   On the power play, Forsberg's pressure helped prevent the Kings
from clearing the puck into the neutral zone, and Sakic made them pay
with his second goal of the game and third of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter helps everybody on our hockey club because with him in
there, you just cannot key on one line," said Sakic, who has three
goals and an assist in the playoffs. "He does so much out there for
the other lines and certainly creates more space for us when he's on
the power play as well."</TE>
<TE>   After Los Angeles took a 3-2 lead in the second period, Forsberg
once again jumped into the spotlight. After a shot from the blue line
by defenseman Greg de Vries and a failed rebound attempt by winger
Steven Reinprecht, Forsberg hustled to pick up a loose puck near the
crease and scored his first goal since April 30, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to score a goal," Forsberg said. "It's been a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   With Colorado holding a one-goal lead in the third period,
Forsberg was all over the ice. If he wasn't making a crunching check
on Bryan Smolinski, he was creating havoc around the net for
goaltender Felix Potvin. Forsberg's hard work paid off when he picked
up his fourth assist in two games on an insurance goal by Chris Drury
with 11:15 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't keep worrying about how good Peter is playing from game
to game, we have to get our own game going here," King defenseman
Aaron Miller said. "We need to play better defensively. He's just one
of many guys we have to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Which is exactly the Kings' problem.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do they have to watch out for Forsberg and Sakic, but the
Kings also have to be concerned about Colorado's other skilled
players, such as Alex Tanguay, Radim Vrbata, Reinprecht and Drury.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings to get back in the series, they will have to be a
lot more responsible defensively. Colorado's Patrick Roy is one of
the game's all-time best playoff goaltenders, but the Kings did score
three goals against him in each of the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' biggest challenge will be getting more help for Potvin,
who has faced 69 shots in two games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to find one reason, that's just the way it's
been going in the series," Potvin said. . "Peter makes their second
line.... He gives them good balance."</TE>
<TE>   It's now Coach Andy Murray's turn to get the Kings back on track.
They have played OK on offense, but their defensive breakdowns have
hurt them. Being able to submit his starting line after the Avalanche
has done so in the next two games at home will help because the
Kings' top line had trouble containing Colorado's top two lines,
which featured Sakic and Forsberg.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look at these two games and see where we can make
adjustments," Smolinski said. "We made a lot of mistakes coming out
of our defensive zone that have given them their goals.</TE>
<TE>   "If we eliminate those mistakes, the games would have been
different."</TE>
<TE>   If the Kings don't make changes, the playoffs will be over for
them before they know it.</TE>

<KH>Mike Penner SOUND AND VISION</KH>
<HD>Spurrier Era Takes Flight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Did you see the separation Steve Spurrier got Saturday?</LD>
<LD>   Did you check out his elevation?</LD>
<LD>   Not even Donte Stallworth, the new New Orleans Saint who allegedly
runs a 4.23-second 40, could keep up with Spurrier, who was spotted
by ESPN cameras in a helicopter lifting off from the Washington
Redskins' training base and headed for a draft-day party with fans.</LD>
<TE>   During the middle of the first round!</TE>
<TE>   The NFL became a very different place when Spurrier signed on to
coach the Redskins. And as the surreal scene of Spurrier
chop-chop-chopping his way into the distance filled the television
screen, sending ESPN's draft analysts into spasms of apoplexy, five
words immediately came to mind:</TE>
<TE>   What took him so long?</TE>
<TE>   Think about it: Like most of us, Spurrier had already spent more
than five hours of a perfectly good Saturday cooped up indoors,
staring at an endless procession of names, numbers and decimal
points. Chances are he also probably had his fill of Ron Jaworski.</TE>
<TE>   Why not  take the team copter out for a spin, clear the head a
little?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, there were still four more teams on the board before the
Redskins' first selection (that could take another hour, easy) ...
and Spurrier was leaving good people behind to man the war room ...
and isn't the ability to delegate a prime fundamental of great
leadership?</TE>
<TE>   Also, it was a lot of fun watching Mel Kiper react as if Spurrier
had just spit on his left-tackles-with-tremendous-upside chart.</TE>
<TE>   Reporting from the getaway scene, chopper fading into the
background, Sal Paolantonio sent it back to the studio thusly: "A
very odd moment, to say the least, here, Boomer."</TE>
<TE>   Boomer was momentarily speechless.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I ... did I ... did I see that right, Sal?" Chris Berman
finally spluttered as he turned to Jimmy Johnson. "I mean, what are
we doing?"</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who used to scarf nachos and play with his pet dog
Buttercup during Cowboy draft days of yore and still managed to land
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, shook his head and laughed and said, "I
guess Steve kind of wrote down a list of guys that he might like to
have and gave it to [team owner Daniel] Snyder."</TE>
<TE>   Berman couldn't stop spluttering:</TE>
<TE>   "Mel ... that was ... wow!"</TE>
<TE>   Kiper seemed to have another word in mind, but didn't appear to be
in the mood to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "You know me," Kiper said, and yes we certainly do. "You're asking
the wrong person. This is no time for partying. That's after the
draft."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Spurrier could be a revolutionary genius.
Consider the Redskins' last two drafts, conducted with somewhat
dissimilar decorum.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, under Marty Schottenheimer, it was all old-school,
by-the-book and no scribbling in the margins. The Redskins entered
training camp with Jeff George as their starting quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Spurrier took an extra long coffee break, winged on over
to FedEx Field to jam with 7,000 Redskin fans, circled back,
sauntered back in and used the last pick of the first round to select
Tulane quarterback Patrick Ramsey, who drew raves from ESPN's draft
panel.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of guy you'd want your wife to marry, that's how good he
is," Merrill Hoge quipped.</TE>
<TE>   You make the call: George or Ramsey?</TE>
<TE>   Party on, Steve!</TE>
<TE>   Already, Spurrier is shaping up as the best thing to happen to the
NFL since the XFL. When Spurrier looks at an NFL stadium, he sees an
entertainment stage, not an altar. When it comes to stocking his
roster, Spurrier prefers the old college way--mailing kids copies of
the glossy Florida Gator media guide and waiting for them to knock on
his door.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL draft? Spurrier can take it or--as we have just seen,
quite vividly--he can leave it. He is smart enough to know it is not
splitting the atom. Heck, he will tell you, it's not even the bowl
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   It's a two-day guessing game with a television contract, that's
what it is. But if ESPN is going to devote so much time to it, and
ship half of Bristol, Conn., to Madison Square Garden to cover it,
everyone involved had better have the proper game face on.</TE>
<TE>   When Dallas used up its allotted 15 minutes before doing something
with its first-round pick, ESPN's crew reacted as if the Cowboys were
a franchise in the throes of utter chaos. And when Minnesota, on
deck, failed to jump up immediately to make their pick and take
advantage of the Cowboys' hesitation, the Vikings were portrayed as
hopeless chokers in the clutch. As if that had never been suggested
before.</TE>
<TE>   When ESPN sent someone to interrogate Jerry Jones about this
all-time draft-day gaffe, the Cowboy owner advised everyone to settle
down.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys pushed the clock to the limit in order to complete a
deal with Kansas City, trading down two slots and gaining a
third-round pick from the Chiefs. Jones said he heard Johnson
fretting on the air about "time's off the clock," but pointed out
that the worst-case scenario really wasn't so bad: Dallas would have
forfeited the sixth pick to the Vikings, who would have chosen North
Carolina defensive tackle Ryan Sims, and then the Cowboys would have
drafted next, using the seventh pick to select whom they eventually
selected with the eighth pick, Oklahoma safety Roy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota didn't get off the hook so easily.</TE>
<TE>   "Minnesota could have jumped in there and took the player [Sims]
Kansas City wanted," Johnson said. "They could have moved right up
there and got their card in and taken Sims. And that would have
killed the Kansas City trade. You've got to be ready!"</TE>
<TE>   Berman, realizing the mood might have turned a tad too serious,
mused that "the Vikings have to re-evaluate their team speed at the
guy sitting at the phone."</TE>
<TE>   Either that or rent a helicopter.</TE>

<LD>El Segundo High baseball Coach John Stevenson recorded his 900th
career victory when the Eagles (9-12) defeated San Pedro, 9-4, in the
fourth round of the El Segundo tournament Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Stevenson, the winningest high school baseball coach in
California, has compiled a 900-347 record with 27 league and six
Southern Section titles in 43 years at El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   "I consider myself extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity
to spend my entire career here in El Segundo," Stevenson said in a
statement. "I also want to share this with the approximately 350
Eagle baseball players who earned those wins as well as their
parents, my many co-coaches and community coaches. They all have a
piece of those 900 wins."</LD>
<TE>   Two other Southland baseball coaches recorded milestone victories
this weekend. Anaheim Esperanza Coach Mike Curran collected his 500th

<LD>   Freshman Brittany Weil pitched a one-hitter in the championship
game, knocking off No. 1 Santa Ana Mater Dei, 1-0, a few hours after
her team strung together four hits in the sixth inning to beat No. 2
Santa Ana Foothill, 2-0.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a little nervous," said Weil (14-0), the tournament's most
valuable player who scattered six hits against Foothill (21-3).</LD>
<TE>   With the victories, Pacifica (19-2-1) can lay claim to No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew how good we were, but we were a little skeptical about
our pitching," said Pacifica Coach Rob Weil, Brittany's father.
"Brittany has been coming through, and everyone else has contributed
to make this thing work."</TE>
<TE>   It worked in the third inning against Mater Dei (18-3), when Amy
Mayrhofer drew a one-out walk, took second on Jessica Marical's
sacrifice bunt and scored on Mallorie Lenn's single.</TE>
<TE>   Against Foothill--which took third with a 1-0 victory over No. 8
Whittier California--Pacifica's Linda Reyes doubled in the sixth
inning, and the Mariners added three singles in a row, getting runs
batted in from Mayrhofer and Marical. In the bottom of the sixth,
Weil got out of a bases-loaded jam with a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>

<TE>   In baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia 4, Crescenta Valley 3--Blake Lloyd had the winning hit in
the 12th inning late Friday to lead the Apaches (16-2, 7-1) to a
Pacific League victory over the Falcons (16-2, 7-1). Trevor Bell
(5-1) took the loss for the Falcons.</TE>

<LD>Tustin High senior Michael Cavic became the second swimmer to break
20 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle in a high school meet,
accomplishing it Saturday at the Santa Ana Foothill Swim Games.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic won the race in 19.94 seconds, just missing the national
high school record of 19.91, set by Houston Memorial's Anthony
Robinson in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to be in the under-20-second club," said Cavic, who
swam for Yugoslavia at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   Cavic didn't shave or taper for the meet, something he plans to do
next month at the Southern Section championships. "It's right there,"
Cavic said of the record.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine girls' team set five meet records and easily won the
team competition with 268 points. Santa Margarita was second (195)
and Foothill and San Clemente tied for third (142).</TE>

<HD>Johnson Soars to Second-Best Outdoor Vault</HD>
<DH>Mt. SAC Relays: Atascadero senior clears 13-4 to win girls'
event on day of record performances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chelsea Johnson's meteoric rise in the girls' pole vault continued
Saturday in the high school portion of the Mt. San Antonio College
Relays in Walnut when the Atascadero senior cleared a meet-record 13
feet 4 inches, the second-best outdoor mark by a high school girl.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson won the 300-meter low hurdles in the Southern Section
Division III championships last season, but she hasn't run that race
this spring after taking up the pole vault in December.</LD>
<LD>   "I never really had that much fun with the hurdles," Johnson said.
"I did it more because I was good at it and that's never a good
reason to do something."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson is the daughter of Jan Johnson, the 1972 Olympic bronze
medalist in the men's pole vault and a highly regarded vault coach
who helped guide Shayla Balentine of Morro Bay to a national record
of 13-8 in the state championships last June. But Chelsea didn't take
up the vault until December because she always felt she lacked the
necessary time to devote to it while competing in volleyball and
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to give myself a month to focus on it," she said. "And
I really enjoyed it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson competed in the shadow of Rachel Viau of Arroyo Grande
during the first part of the season. But she cleared 12-0 to defeat
Viau for the San Luis Obispo County title on April 6 and added six
inches to that mark in defeating Viau and several other top-flight
vaulters in the Arcadia Invitational last week.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Saturday, when she cleared 11-0 on her second attempt,
11-6, 12-0, 12-6 and 13-0 on her first attempts and 13-4 on her third
try. She missed three attempts at a national-record 13-9.</TE>
<TE>   "I could feel it coming," said the UCLA-bound Johnson said. "Today
was the day and I had a little luck."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who also finished sixth in the invitational race of the
100 high hurdles with a 15.05 clocking, produced one of six marks in
the meet that lead the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The others were turned in by Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A.
Baptist in the girls' 200, Tunisia Johnson of Long Beach Poly in the
300 low hurdles, Long Beach Poly in the girls' 400 relay, Woodland
Hills Taft in the boys' 800 relay and Simi Valley Royal in the boys'
distance medley relay.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, a junior, ran 23.05 seconds in the girls' 200 to move to
ninth on the all-time national list and to fifth on the all-time
state list. She also ran a sizzling 51.5 leg in the 1,600 relay to
help L.A. Baptist finish second in its heat in 3 minutes 58.49
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The USC-bound Johnson won the 300 low hurdles in 42.58 and the
Poly girls' 400 relay team, anchored by Shalonda Solomon, won in
45.83.</TE>
<TE>   The Taft team, anchored by Noah Smith, ran 1:26.02 to win the
boys' 800 relay for the second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Royal won the boys' distance medley relay in 10:13.28 after Travis
Patterson ran 4:12.1 on his 1,600 anchor leg.</TE>
<TE>   Poly posted runaway victories in the boys' and girls' team scoring
that was contested at Mt. SAC for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Alan Webb of Michigan, who set a national high school
record of 3:53.43 in the mile last year, finished ninth in the final
heat of the university-open men's 1,500 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, the U.S. leader in the mile as a senior at South Lakes High
in Reston, Va., last year, was making his collegiate track debut
after being sidelined with Achilles' tendonitis.</TE>
<TE>   He was timed in 3:44.74 in a race won by Adrian Blincoe of
Villanova in 3:41.85.</TE>
<TE>   Webb took the lead 250 meters into the race and led the field
through 400 meters in 59.9 and 800 in 2:00.6. He appeared to lose his
momentum around the final curve, however, when Ryan Hayden of
Villanova shoved him from behind after Webb appeared to cut in front
of him prematurely.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Works Overtime to Gain Tie With Dallas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Galaxy apparently has the pages of its 2002 Major League Soccer
script stuck together.</LD>
<LD>   For the fourth game in a row, Los Angeles was taken to overtime,
emerging with a 1-1 tie against the Dallas Burn in front of 17,388 on
a hot and humid Saturday evening in the Cotton Bowl at Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   And for the fourth game in a row, Carlos Ruiz was the only Galaxy
player to score a goal, giving the Guatemalan striker six in his
first four MLS matches.</LD>
<TE>   It was one of those strange games that the Galaxy, the league's
only unbeaten team at 2-0-2, could have won by four goals or lost by
two. The luck cut both ways.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz gave Los Angeles the lead in the 26th minute, slipping in at
the back post and redirecting Alexi Lalas' glancing header into the
net after Lalas had received the ball from a Simon Elliott corner
kick.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz could have secured the victory in the final minute of the
first half, but his rising shot off a pass from Tyrone Marshall, who
was making his first start in place of injured Ezra Hendrickson,
struck the crossbar and Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan smothered Ruiz's
follow-up shot.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan also made a superb save against Elliott in the ninth minute
of overtime when he threw himself to his right to tip the New
Zealander's fierce shot around the post to preserve the tie.</TE>
<TE>   The Burn, which extended its unbeaten streak against the Galaxy to
seven games, with the last four ending in ties, got its goal in the
62nd minute when Lalas shielded the ball, expecting goalkeeper Matt
Reis to come and get it, only to see Jason Kreis sneak between them,
steal the ball and fire it into the empty net, clipping the right
post on the way.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy nearly gave Dallas (1-1-2) the victory late in the game
when Reis, believing that the ball was going wide, purposely allowed
a high back pass from Adam Frye to go past him, only to see the ball
hit the right post.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, the Galaxy acquired Jamaican national team
midfielder Winston Griffiths, 23, from the MetroStars for a
conditional draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other MLS games:</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Kansas City 1--A headed goal by defender Ivan
McKinley off a cross from Bobby Convey two minutes into overtime
lifted D.C. United in front of 12,759 on a wet afternoon at
Washington. Ali Curtis gave United (2-3) the lead in the 71st minute,
but Preki tied the score two minutes later. The Wizards are 1-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   New England 2, Columbus 0--A crowd of 13,493 saw the Revolution
(1-2) get first-half goals from rookie Taylor Twellman and Jim Rooney
to beat the Crew (1-3) at Columbus for the first time since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, New York/New Jersey 0--The Fire (2-2) earned its fourth
consecutive victory over the MetroStars as rookie defender Kelly Gray
scored his first goal and DaMarcus Beasley scored in front of 20,047
at East Rutherford, N.J. The MetroStars (3-2) played a man short for
nearly an hour after Tab Ramos was ejected for a studs-up tackle on
Peter Nowak.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Colorado 0--The Earthquakes (3-2) shut out the Rapids
(2-2-1) behind goals by Ariel Graziani and Landon Donovan in front of
8,188 at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Women's United Soccer Assn. games:</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, New York 1--Shannon MacMillan and Zhang Ouying each
scored twice, Lori Lindsey got one goal and the Power contributed an
own goal in front of 5,216 at San Diego, and the Spirit (1-1) set a
WUSA record for most goals in a game. Emily Janss scored for New York
(1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Atlanta 1--Norway's Dagny Mellgren gave Boston (1-1) the
lead in the 10th minute, and Angela Hucles and Kristine Lilly also
scored in front of 6,305 at Boston. China's Liping Wang scored for
the Beat (0-2).</TE>

<HD>Some Choice Cuts to Be Made</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suppose, for a moment, that when the United States roster for the
World Cup is announced on ESPN's "SportsCenter" Monday evening, it is
Steve Sampson in front of the cameras, not Bruce Arena.</LD>
<LD>   What would the coach who suffered through the Americans'
three-loss performance at France '98 do if given the chance to pick
the U.S. team for Korea/Japan '02?</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, Sampson's roster of 23 players differs only
slightly from the one Arena, his successor as national team coach, is
expected to unveil Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there are significant differences, and Sampson
identified two areas where Arena could run into difficulty at the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   One is in his choice of starting goalkeeper. The other is in the
weakness of his outside defenders, the right and left backs.</TE>
<TE>   Both coaches agree that Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller are the top
two goalkeepers, but whereas Arena seems likely to take Tony Meola as
his third keeper, Sampson prefers Tim Howard.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood of a third goalkeeper getting any playing time is
remote," Sampson said. "I really feel that Howard is a future
goalkeeper for the national team and he could gain a lot more by the
experience. That's not taking anything away from Tony, who certainly
has been exceptional in MLS, but at some point you've got to use some
of those 23 spots to build for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Keller and Friedel each believes that he should be the starter and
both have made a good argument by their play. There were rumblings of
discontent when Arena couldn't decide between them during qualifying,
and now there is the possibility of open revolt from whichever one is
left on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think either one of them will be quiet this time around,
but hopefully the lessons of the last World Cup will help them in
that regard," Sampson said, alluding to ugly scenes when some of his
players turned against him in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the single greatest decision that Bruce has to make. I
think what he has to do is go with his gut instinct, pick who he
believes is the very best player for the moment and hope that the
other behaves himself and acts professionally."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the outside backs is just as thorny. No matter
who Arena has played in the two positions, deficiencies have been
evident. The players chosen have lacked either physical size and
strength, speed, tactical awareness, experience, or any combination
of those factors.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't seen any other answers for Bruce in MLS or overseas,"
Sampson said. "Bruce has to work with the players that he has.
Hopefully, in training they can work on covering in behind players,
so that one player doesn't get exposed one on one."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is a long way from producing, say, left backs of the
caliber of Italy's Paolo Maldini or Brazil's Roberto Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   "But those are the [type of] players we're matched up against,"
Sampson said. "It all comes down to speed. We have not been able to
match the physical speed of [opponents] who typically play in the
wide positions, representing the top 10 or 15 teams in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, they are extremely fast, extremely dynamic, and
because of that we tend to show a little too much respect and give
them too much space because of our lack of pace."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson will be going to the World Cup as a color commentator
alongside Andres Cantor for the Futbol de Primera Spanish-language
radio network.</TE>
<TE>   Three other players he would take to Korea but Arena remains
uncertain about are defenders Greg Vanney and Pablo Mastroeni and
midfielder Brian Maisonneuve.</TE>
<TE>   Vanney, he said, is needed as cover for David Regis, the probable
starting left back. "I think Regis is getting on in years," Sampson
said. "David has got good speed but he's been injured on occasion. I
really believe that Greg Vanney, although he hasn't been exceptional,
just going to the event will gain an awful lot from it.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest question marks with Greg is, does he have the
pace? If Bruce decides to use [Jeff] Agoos centrally and Regis isn't
in form, then I think it makes sense to take a look at Vanney."</TE>
<TE>   At right back, Arena is expected to employ Tony Sanneh, who has
the size but not the savvy. Sampson agreed that there really is no
other clear option, not even his own choice in 1998, Frankie Hejduk.</TE>
<TE>   "Hejduk has one advantage in that he has speed," Sampson said.
"But he has deficiencies in the air, deficiencies in getting forward
and crossing well.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you've got [an opposing] player where you just have to
match speed with speed, then Hejduk's your choice."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson also would prefer to see Mastroeni on the roster rather
than Arena's probable choice, Carlos Llamosa.</TE>
<TE>   "Although he [Mastroeni] lacks a lot of international experience,
I think he's proven in a short amount of time that the pressure
doesn't bother him," Sampson said. "I think he's got as much, if not
more, speed as others in that position. I think he plays out of the
back beautifully and he can play in the midfield too.</TE>
<TE>   "Llamosa, although I believe he's a mature player and he brings a
sense of calm back there, recently I've seen a slowing of his pace.
Three or four months ago, I would have selected him."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson also favors taking Maisonneuve.</TE>
<TE>   "His experience in the '98 World Cup will bring that side of it to
the team," he said. "He won't be shocked by the event. He would be my
choice to take [Chris] Armas' spot. He has the physical size and I
think he's one of the best tacklers of all the players in the
national team program. People think that he's slow, but he's not.
He's deceptively quick and his speed of thought is so very good."</TE>
<TE>   One player not on Sampson's list is DaMarcus Beasley.</TE>
<TE>   "Beasley has a lot of promise," Sampson said. "But I think he's
young. I think he's a little slight, physically. He's got incredible
speed and he's definitely one for the future, but at this point I
wouldn't use up one of my top 23 [choices] for him."</TE>

<LD>Last month, the school newspaper at North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake
High ran an article entitled, "Booze, Drugs &amp; Sports."</LD>
<LD>   Ninety-five Wolverine athletes were surveyed and 48% admitted
having smoked or drank within 24 hours of a game.</LD>
<LD>   One unidentified athlete said, "I think my stats show that I play
better in games after a night that I drink. I don't get hung over, so
I don't think it should matter whether I drink or not. That should be
my decision."</LD>
<TE>   The story was provocative, informative and should have produced an
immediate response from school administrators in the form of advising
coaches to start taking a closer look at what their athletes are
doing away from school.</TE>
<TE>   But that's unlikely to happen at Harvard-Westlake, where tuition
will cost $18,300 next year. Harvard-Westlake believes in privacy
rights and trusts parents to create and impose their own disciplinary
and ethical standards on their children away from campus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my belief people should learn what to do because it's
right," Headmaster Thomas Hudnut said. "I think punishment is the
last resort, and it's better to appeal to people's good instincts
than merely address the bad ones."</TE>
<TE>   Growing numbers of public and private schools are asking athletes
to sign contracts requiring them to abstain from drinking if they
want to participate in sports. It's a worthy attempt to establish an
alcohol-free environment.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes at Harvard-Westlake who drink at parties or social
gatherings are unlikely to receive disciplinary action by school
officials unless it reflects badly on the school or results in legal
action.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't condone it, but it's not our role to tell parents how to
raise kids," boys' basketball Coach Greg Hilliard said. "We wish
these kids would realize the dangers of drinking."</TE>
<TE>   But playing on an athletic team is a privilege, not a right,
obligating coaches to impose stricter standards on the conduct of
their students.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage drinking is not acceptable on or off campus, during the
season or out of season. It should not be tolerated, whether parents
approve or not.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A change in NCAA basketball recruiting rules immediately allows
juniors in high school to take official recruiting trips and have
home visits with college coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Omar Wilkes of Los Angeles Loyola High had a home visit with
Kansas Coach Roy Williams earlier this week. Ekene Ibekwe, a 6-9
center from Carson, is scheduled to take a recruiting trip to
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure should change its nickname from Seraphs to
Highlanders, considering that the football team's starting inside
linebackers this fall, Lee Martin and Tony Castaldi, are transfers
from Simi Valley Royal. Castaldi arrived in January. He and Martin
carpool from Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Fremont has picked up a key transfer student in Michael
Beach, who started at quarterback last season at Hamilton. Beach is
expected to have lots of success passing to All-City receiver Mark
Bradford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Chatsworth (19-1) had better not purchase those
2002 City championship baseball rings just yet. Sylmar (15-4) is
making the kind of steady improvement that could make it a legitimate
City title contender.</TE>
<TE>   Crucial to the Spartans' rise has been a healthy Jamie Mah, who
started the season unable to pitch because of a shoulder injury. He
pitched a complete game last week to end Woodland Hills El Camino
Real's winning streak at 13 games. Earlier this season, he hit a
grand slam to defeat the City's hardest throwing pitcher, Eddie Baeza
of Poly.</TE>
<TE>   "We're playing pretty well and definitely doing things that
indicate [we] might be [City title contenders]," Coach Gary Donatella
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Ray Rivera, who could be the leading candidate to
replace Donatella if he retires at the end of this season, has done a
terrific job with the pitching staff despite injuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remember the name Cary Harris. He's a freshman at Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame and already being compared to former Knight running back
Justin Fargas.</TE>
<TE>   "He's faster than Justin was as a young guy," track coach Joe
McNab said. "I don't know if he'll be faster than Justin as a
senior."</TE>
<TE>   Harris has run 49.8 in the 400 meters and 22.4 in the 200. He
could be the Knights' starting tailback as a sophomore this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame is gaining a top incoming freshman quarterback in
Garrett Green, cousin of USC quarterback Brandon Hance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior shortstop Chris Valaika of Newhall Hart is on a hitting
tear. He had leadoff home runs in consecutive games against Valencia
and Canyon. He has 18 hits, including five home runs, in his last 34
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Redell, football coach at Westlake Village Oaks Christian and
a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, has decided to launch
a program teaching leadership skills to teenage boys ages 13 to 18.
The weekly class begins on June 27 at Oaks Christian and will last
four weeks. Cost is $125.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a crying need in this country for men to be
leaders," Redell said.</TE>
<TE>   Redell plans to focus on teaching integrity, ethics and developing
self-confidence. Information: (818) 575-9228.</TE>

<CX>   High school basketball--A change in NCAA rules involving the
recruiting of high school basketball players who are juniors was reported
incorrectly Sunday in Sports. College coaches can meet with juniors one
time at their schools, not homes. Also, Kansas Coach Roy Williams met
with Los Angeles Loyola guard Omar Wilkes at Loyola High.</CX>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Capriati will drop out of the No. 1 ranking after she was
stunned by Patty Schnyder, 6-4, 6-3, Saturday in the Family Circle
Cup, setting up the first top-tier WTA Tour final between unseeded
players.</LD>
<LD>   Schnyder will face Iva Majoli today for the title at the
$1.2-million clay-court event in Charleston, S.C. Majoli eliminated
No. 7-seeded Sandrine Testud, 6-2, 6-4, in the semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Capriati's loss means she will fall behind Venus Williams again
when next week's WTA Tour rankings are released. Williams was last at
No. 1 on March 18.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe I've lost it for this moment, but I wouldn't say the whole
year," said Capriati, playing her first clay-court event since
winning the French Open last year. "[There are] a lot of tournaments
to play."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's results capped a week of upsets. Schnyder, ranked 30th,
has beaten three top-10 players, including Williams' sister, No. 7
Serena, and No. 10 Amelie Mauresmo. "I never had such a performance,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former French Open champion Carlos Moya, pulling out of a
three-year slump, beat Tim Henman, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, for a place in the
final of the Monte Carlo Masters.</TE>
<TE>   The unseeded Spaniard reached a Masters Series event final for the
first time since 1999 at Indian Wells. Countryman Juan Carlos Ferrero
beat Sebastien Grosjean, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0, in the other semifinal.</TE>

<HD>It's a Blistering Day for Fargas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The highlight of USC's final spring practice came late in a Saturday
scrimmage and gave the Trojans two reasons to be hopeful in the
months between now and the start of summer training camp in August.</LD>
<LD>   With the first-string offense on the field, Justin Fargas twisted
out of one tackle, then eluded another defender as he sprinted toward
the end zone. It was the kind of effort coaches have come to expect
from a player who could be the answer at tailback next season.</LD>
<LD>   "Justin was special again today," Coach Pete Carroll said of the
senior, who carried 12 times for 111 yards and a touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   But near the end of that 36-yard run, as Fargas seemed ready to
score, cornerback Marcell Allmond dived from the side to strip the
ball free. It was recovered on the five-yard line by safety DeShaun
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally forced a turnover," Allmond said. "I've been waiting
all spring to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, he has waited even longer. After two seasons at
receiver, Allmond was suspended from school last fall for fighting
with other students. Upon his return, he was moved to defensive back,
where the Trojans are thin.</TE>
<TE>   Although he still has much to learn, Allmond has the size and
quickness to help his team out of a jam, perhaps as a nickelback.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that play, the scrimmage was largely unremarkable, as
is often the case with spring workouts. Quarterback Carson Palmer
completed eight of 13 passes for 104 yards, throwing a short
touchdown to D. Hale but also suffering an interception and a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Sultan McCullough carried 10 times for 48 yards. Neither
Matt Cassel nor Matt Leinart played well enough to settle the
competition for second-string quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll seemed happiest that his offensive line, already besieged
by injury, survived the day short-handed while his defense curbed a
recent tendency to surrender big plays. Safety Troy Polamalu led all
tacklers with five, Allmond had four. "It's the last day of spring
practice," Allmond said. "I just treated it like fun."</TE>
