<HD>INS Is Holding Rapper</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Slick Rick waits in a detention center as law's
application to past jail time is weighed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1996, after five years in prison, rapper Slick Rick was desperate
to make new music, return to his beloved Bronx streets and dote on
his two children.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, the same crime that put him in prison has landed him
behind bars again, and may lead to the British citizen's deportation
from the country he has called home since 1976.</LD>
<LD>   "It was devastating," the rapper said Friday in a phone interview
from an immigration detention facility in Manatee County, Fla. "You
believe you served your time for the mistake you made and that you've
rehabilitated yourself, then to be back inside, it's kind of hard."</LD>
<TE>   An immigration law that calls for the deportation of any
noncitizen who serves more than five years in a U.S. prison has
caught up to the rapper a full six years after he was released from
prison, where he served five years and 14 days for a shooting that
wounded two men.</TE>
<TE>   With a sometimes cartoonish, always colorful style, the rapper
first hit the scene in a big way in 1985 with "La Di Da Di" and the
"The Show," a pair of hit collaborations with Doug E. Fresh. Long
before Jay-Z, Slick Rick infused his hip-hop with a pimp persona and
made it one of the bedrock images of the genre. With heaps of jewelry
and his trademark eye patch, the rhyming Lothario offered his
worldview in such tracks as "Treat Her Like a Prostitute." He took
heat for his content, but his 1988 album "The Great Adventures of
Slick Rick" was a platinum-seller that has taken on the status of a
classic.</TE>
<TE>   Rick, whose real name is Richard Walters, came to America in 1976
as an 11-year-old of British birth and Jamaican heritage, and he
already had his eye patch--he wore it because of a glass shard that
had injured his eye.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was a legal resident, he never became a naturalized
citizen, which was a major issue after he ran afoul of the law. He
was convicted in 1991 of attempted murder for the N.Y. street
showdown.</TE>
<TE>   His supporters insist that the confrontation was a matter of
defense against dangerous rivals. But authorities seized a cache of
weapons in his trunk at the time of his arrest. Either way, Rick was
convicted and sent to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Aware of his immigration status, his attorneys secured a waiver
from an INS judge in June 1995 to permit him to stay in the country,
and seven months later he was released from prison. The INS, though,
pursued the matter and in March 1997 negated the waiver. Attorneys
began another appeal, but the rapper says he was unaware his name was
on a warrant.</TE>
<TE>   In Miami on June 1, Rick was arrested by INS agents screening
passengers on a cruise ship that had hired him, Erykah Badu, Angie
Stone, the Gap Band and others as entertainment for a Caribbean
voyage. Deemed a flight risk, he has been in custody since.</TE>
<TE>   A number of notables have lent their names to Rick's bid for
freedom, among them actor and rapper Will Smith, music mogul Russell
Simmons, comedian Chris Rock, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and New York
State Sen. David Paterson. "I have known Rick for over 15 years....
While I'm aware of his past problems, I've also had the pleasure to
watch him develop into a good person," Smith stated in a letter to
the INS.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solomiany, a Miami-based immigration attorney, represents
Rick and plans to meet again on Monday with immigration officials and
then file a new petition in the U.S. District Court in Tampa. He says
the rapper's fate may take months or even a year to sort out. "We
want him free while we fight this," Solomiany said. "But that remains
to be seen."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe I'm a bad person," Rick said. "The whole incident
was years ago. I've been out and six years crime-free. All this now
seems like an extreme measure."</TE>

<HD>It's Haden Versus Rubalcaba, Round 2, at Latin Grammys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Oscar Garza</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are two awards shows better, or more confusing, than one?</LD>
<LD>   When nominations for the third annual Latin Grammys were announced
Wednesday, recordings by bassist Charlie Haden ("Nocturne") and
pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba ("Supernova") were once again pitted
against each other in the Latin jazz category. The same thing
happened earlier this year in the Grammy Awards, when Haden won the
honors.</LD>
<LD>   Complicating matters further, Rubalcaba not only played on Haden's
album, he was also co-producer and was credited with the
orchestrations.</LD>
<TE>   To get a handicap on this Latin Grammy contest, we consulted David
Sanchez, the saxophonist who also played on Haden's album and who
recently performed with Rubalcaba at the Montreal Jazz Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Will Rubalcaba be aided by a Latin Grammy membership that has more
Spanish-speaking members?</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible," said Sanchez. "I've heard people say, 'Charlie's
not even a Latino, and all the arrangements were by Gonzalo.' But
Charlie was the leader, and he made a beautiful album."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, whose own album, "Travesia," received a Latin jazz nod in
the Grammys (confused yet?), lamented that he didn't get a Latin
Grammy nod. He blames his label, Sony Discos, for not submitting his
album for consideration.</TE>
<TE>   So who will win the Latin Grammy? "Probably Gonzalo," Sanchez
responded, laughing, "since I'm not in the picture."</TE>

<HD>Flaps Dull Flash of PBS Lineup</HD>
<DH>Television* Media questions network more about HIV-positive
Muppet and Louis Rukeyser than new programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discussion of two recent controversies--Louis Rukeyser's bitter exit
from the long-running financial program "Wall Street Week," and the
potential presence of an HIV-positive Muppet on the children's show
"Sesame Street"--dominated PBS' session with television reporters
gathered in Pasadena on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   PBS President and Chief Executive Pat Mitchell tried to distract
the media by offering them the venerated newscaster Walter Cronkite,
who appeared live via satellite from Martha's Vineyard to discuss his
role as the voice of Benjamin Franklin in a new animated children's
series, "Liberty's Kids." The historical series will debut Labor Day
weekend, with a host of other celebrities voicing parts, including
Ben Stiller and Sylvester Stallone.</LD>
<LD>   But reporters were more interested in grilling Mitchell on the
lingering "Wall Street Week" and "Sesame Street" issues, both public
relations snafus that have dogged PBS.</LD>
<TE>   Rukeyser abruptly left "Wall Street Week" earlier this year in a
feud with both PBS and his producers, Maryland Public Television.
They wanted to revamp the show, which had become PBS' lowest-rated
prime-time series, in part, Mitchell said Friday, because the
investor community had changed over the years to include more women
and a generally younger audience. But the suggested changes, she
said, were "nothing dramatic and nothing that included changing the
host."</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser has since reemerged on CNBC, and 158 PBS stations air
him--though only six in the top 20 PBS markets, Mitchell noted.</TE>
<TE>   And in the fall, Sesame Workshop, which produces "Sesame Street,"
plans to introduce an HIV-positive character in the South African
version of the show, arousing concern among U.S. lawmakers. Mitchell
subsequently sent a letter assuring congressional members that no
public money was going toward the introduction of that character and
that there were no plans to introduce such a character in the
American "Sesame Street."</TE>
<TE>   "Every 2- to 4-year-old in South Africa knows about HIV or AIDS,"
Mitchell said Friday, explaining why such a character was culturally
relevant in that country. She said viewer mail she'd read convinced
her "it's not the time now" to expose kids in this country to the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell also stressed that such creative decisions are made not
by Congress or PBS but by Sesame Workshop, stressing "the firewall"
between PBS content and government input.</TE>
<TE>   Still, reporters weren't entirely convinced, with one asking
Mitchell how lawmakers might respond if "Sesame Street" introduced a
handicapped Muppet.</TE>
<TE>   "You're asking me to go into the minds of Congress," Mitchell
said.</TE>
<TE>   The twin controversies come at a time when PBS is struggling with
station layoffs, dwindling viewership amid competition from copycat
cable programming and a looming $1.8-billion conversion to digital
transmission. And then there's the perennial dilemma: the search for
funding for a broadcasting service that relies on the largess of the
viewing public for more than half its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, said Mitchell, who came to PBS more than two years ago
from CNN Productions, "it is quite amazing that the institution stays
as strong as it does."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, PBS, which recently picked up 41 Emmy nominations,
talked up a host of new programming for the fall and beyond. The menu
includes "Colonial House," from the makers of "Frontier House" and
"The 1900 House"; a production of "The Gin Game" starring Mary Tyler
Moore and Dick Van Dyke, to be shot at the KCET Studios in Hollywood;
and "The Blues," a seven-part documentary series on the music genre
from filmmaker Martin Scorsese.</TE>
<TE>   In other nods to PBS' branding imperatives, the broadcasting
service will start airing a "Be More" promotional campaign in the
fall and has entered into a partnership with TiVo to promote PBS'
upcoming programming related to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   That programming will include "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero,"
from PBS' investigative series "Frontline."</TE>

<HD>Miramax Joins the Osbournes</HD>
<DH>Home Video* MTV's favorite foul-mouthed family closes a
$7-million DVD/VHS deal with the film company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stars of MTV's raucous hit television series "The Osbournes" have
landed another big payday--this time from Miramax Films for the
DVD/videocassette release of the show.</LD>
<LD>   With multimillion-dollar agreements for new episodes of the show,
a lucrative book deal and now a rich DVD deal, the Osbournes have
parlayed their profanity-laced lives into a cottage industry worth an
estimated $30 million.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker Ozzy Osbourne and his wife and manager Sharon Osbourne on
Friday closed a DVD/video agreement worth roughly $7 million with
Miramax, the company behind such films as the upcoming "Gangs of New
York" and this year's Oscar contender, "In the Bedroom."</LD>
<TE>   The new deal covers the first and second seasons of the show.
Miramax, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., will market both
censored and uncensored versions of both seasons produced by MTV. The
series, which follows the Osbournes and two of their three children
day to day in their Beverly Hills home, is thick with profanity and
frank discussions about everything from drugs to gynecological exams.</TE>
<TE>   "The Osbournes" emerged as the highest-rated cable series in MTV's
20-year history, averaging 5.3 million viewers during the first
season and peaking at more than 7.2 million viewers for the season
finale, based on Nielsen Media Research data.</TE>
<TE>   The deal represents a shrewd move by the Osbournes and their
agents. Early in their negotiations, the Osbournes switched
representatives from Creative Artists Agency to Endeavor, which
renegotiated the entire deal to give the family more control.</TE>
<TE>   In May, they closed a multimillion-dollar deal with MTV for 20
more episodes of the show, which gave the clan ownership of the
series and control over ancillary rights such as syndication,
licensing and merchandising and the DVD/videocassette releases.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the original first-season deal, no
DVD/videocassette or syndication rights had been negotiated since no
one had any idea the show would become such a phenomenon, according
to people knowledgeable about that deal. The Osbournes received
$100,000 per episode in the first season. Endeavor was able to raise
the second-season fee to between $400,000 and $500,000 per episode.</TE>
<TE>   MTV, which under normal circumstances would have controlled home
video rights for one of its series, is a profit participant in the
video deal.</TE>
<TE>   However, both MTV and Miramax are facing a delicate problem in
marketing "The Osbournes" as one of its stars, Sharon Osbourne,
battles cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The family has said they will forge ahead with a new season for
MTV despite the revelation that her cancer was worse than they
previously thought. Sharon Osbourne told the press last week that
although her surgery for colon cancer was a success, her doctors
informed her earlier this month that the disease has spread to her
lymph nodes. She also announced that the family would allow the MTV
audience to watch her as she goes through radiation and chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   The second season is scheduled to begin in November, and Miramax
planned to release the first-season DVD in the fall to coincide with
the campaign for the new season.</TE>
<TE>   How the cancer treatment will play with audiences remains to be
seen. Both MTV and Miramax are adept at marketing controversial fare
and using controversy as a marketing tool, but a TV star in a
life-and-death battle with cancer presents a unique and delicate
situation.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, MTV has prided itself on pushing the envelope in
airing controversial music videos such as Eminem's "The Real Slim
Shady" and Madonna's "Like a Prayer" and shows such as "Jackass." The
network also dealt with one of the people on their series "Real
World" living and dying with AIDS, and aired a special about the
surgery Tom Green, star of another offbeat series, underwent for
testicular cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax Films has deftly used (and sometimes even fueled)
controversy to market such films as "Priest," "The Crow," "Kids"
(which Miramax co-chairmen Bob and Harvey Weinstein distributed
themselves through a company set up to handle just that movie),
"Clerks," and "Dogma" (which ended up being released through another
distributor, Lions Gate).</TE>
<TE>   Miramax closed the deal with the Osbournes despite the seriousness
of Sharon Osbourne's illness.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Weinstein noted that he sees "The Osbournes" as a possible
franchise for Miramax, not unlike the company's "Project Greenlight."
Weinstein pointed out that his relationship with Ozzy Osbourne dates
to his days as a concert promoter, when he booked some of the
rocker's concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said, "Obviously, audiences have
embraced 'The Osbournes' not only for their unique brand of humor but
for the multidimensional nature of their lives. While we can't
predict the future, we're confident that these dedicated viewers will
remain loyal to 'The Osbournes' during this challenging time."</TE>
<TE>   "Our first concern is for Sharon," an MTV spokesperson said, "and
we will deal with the [marketing] issue soon."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, Miramax is paying $3 million for the
first season.</TE>
<TE>   The Osbournes will receive $2.8 million that will come out of an
aggregate 30% royalty for the second season. They will also receive
$1.25 million for their work putting together commentary and other
promotional materials necessary for the DVDs. Miramax will shoulder
the production, replication, distribution and marketing costs. The
Osbournes' new contract with MTV also gave them the right to assemble
with outtakes additional episodes of the show to be sold into
syndication, beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the MTV deal, the family will receive an estimated
$10 million for the first 20 episodes. The agreement also includes a
third season of 20 episodes for another $10 million, contingent upon
whether the second season hits a certain ratings mark.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a third season will be produced is at the discretion of
the Osbournes, who have also entered into a two-book deal with MTV
sister company Simon &amp; Schuster. The first book, a paperback
companion to the show, debuts in November at the beginning of the
second season. A second book, in hardcover, will be published at a
later date. The Osbournes received between $3 million and $4 million
for the two books.</TE>
<TE>   Another cable TV hit, "The Sopranos," is one of HBO's "strongest
sellers" on DVD, but the premium network does not release figures.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's deal for "The Osbournes" continues an industry trend
that involves releasing TV shows on videocassette and DVD. Among
network TV series successfully marketed in home video formats, the
first season of "The Simpsons" has sold more than 1 million copies in
DVD, according to a spokesperson for 20th Century Fox Home
Entertainment. DVD sales have exploded since the format was
introduced in 1997 and accounted for $4.6 billion in sales last year,
according to DVD Entertainment Group, a consortium of the major
studios and distributors.</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 30 million U.S. households currently have DVD
players, taking into account that some homes have more than one of
the nearly 40 million players sold since the format's introduction.
The trade group predicts another 20 million players will ship to
retail stores by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In related developments, Ozzy Osbourne said he would take three
weeks off from Ozzfest 2002 to be with his wife during her first
round of cancer treatment. The band System of a Down will replace him
as the headlining act of the annual event, which was the brainchild
of Sharon Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, producer Gary Binkow has filed suit against Ozzy and
Sharon Osbourne, claiming that they stole the idea for the TV series
from him. Binkow claimed in the suit that he met with the couple and
representatives of Miramax TV on several occasions between 1999 and
2000 to discuss "a real-life docu-sitcom" about their family.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne spokeswoman Lisa Vega said previously published reports
had made clear that Binkow was not the show's creator. MTV is not
named in the suit.</TE>

<HD>Lazy, Hazy Music Days</HD>
<DH>Thursday nights in summer offer an inviting selection of
free musical concerts. The trick is picking the right one(s) and
getting there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if the prospect of another summer night in Los Angeles--and "what
brutal, hot, siren-whining nights they are," as Jack Kerouac
wrote--was not enough to make one break into a sweat, imagine
spending it driving around and attempting to crash four music
performances in a row.</LD>
<LD>   The mission was to map out the freebie music scene on the town,
which is in full swing all summer, but peaks on Thursday nights. The
itinerary hopscotched from downtown to Griffith Park to the hills
perched above West Los Angeles, and wound up at the Santa Monica
Pier.</LD>
<LD>   A music banquet on the run? Or just a tortuous assignment cooked
up by an editor stuck in imaginative overdrive? A million times more
fun than watching reruns of "Will &amp; Grace" on TV? The answers are
yes, yes and yes.</LD>
<TE>   With various locales around town hosting free, open-air concerts,
there is an earful of music to look forward to every week. The
cornucopia of sounds on Thursday included jazz, swing, bossa nova and
danceable pop laced with Algerian rai rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Attending any one of these events would have been a pleasant
enough experience, but four in a row? The brain shivered with sensory
overload; the tires screeched with impatience in the afternoon
commute; the heart took flight in the company of inspired musicians
and fellow Angelenos who came out to have a good time.</TE>
<TE>   The marathon began in the courtyard of Little Tokyo's branch of
the Museum of Contemporary Art, where a crowd of about 100 took their
seats under a mesh canopy.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was mostly senior in age--the 5 p.m. start time assured
that the worker bees were just heading out into the late-afternoon
traffic jam--with the occasional Japanese tourist and visitors who
ventured outside of the air-conditioned cocoon of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The tantalizing smell of hot dogs ($4) and chicken skewers ($5)
floated above the crowd as jazz chanteuse Rene Marie came on stage
wearing a sundress. She was accompanied by a pianist, a bass player
and a drummer.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one confession to make," she said, when the announcer
mistakenly introduced her as a New York City native. "I am from
Virginia. I am definitely a Southern belle, and don't you think
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   It was a point she drove home by attacking her first song, "What a
Difference a Day Makes," with the self-assured elegance of a classic
jazz singer. The band accompanied her as she scatted with obvious
joy.</TE>
<TE>   Audience members grooved to the music discreetly, trying perchance
to avoid sweating any more than they already were in the blistering
afternoon sun--although some had come prepared with straw hats, fans
and Chinese rice paper umbrellas. But with three remaining objectives
to hit, there was no time to linger.</TE>
<TE>   Even dead-on in the midst of rush hour, getting from downtown to
the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, where the swing band Bob's Yer
Uncle was scheduled to perform at 6 p.m., took just about as long as
saying "Bob's your uncle."</TE>
<TE>   In the tiled courtyard of the museum, entire families chilled out
under huge yellow umbrellas, strollers parked nearby. The band
started off with a few severely mellow numbers, the equivalent of
swing on Prozac. It seemed like the most excitement was generated by
a bumble bee that hovered above for a few seconds, provoking a few
small screams.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more like cocktail music," said Patricia Gallardo from
Lancaster, who was there with her two children, mother and husband in
tow. "Maybe they are just warming up."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed they were. By the third song, the eight-piece band attacked
a faster beat and the crowd began showing signs of life. Adult
couples got up to shake a heel, kids intensified their agitation in
an adjacent space labeled, appropriately, "children's dance floor."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful night for a moon dance," crooned lead singer
Rick Fitts, prompting Al Blaisch, from West Los Angeles, to spring
out of his motorized cart--complete with vanity plate--and spin wife
Sylvia on the dance floor. "Not bad for 85, huh?" he remarked later.
"This was a belated Father's Day gift," explained daughter Lois
Blaisch. "We promised dad we would do something."</TE>
<TE>   But there was no time to listen to the band's version of "All
Shook Up." Just as things were heating up in the Autry courtyard, it
was time to hit the road once again. Destination: an intriguing set
at the Skirball Cultural Center by bossa nova duo Smokey &amp; Miho,
fresh from a sold-out club show the previous night.</TE>
<TE>   This is when the much-dreaded traffic-parking nightmares
materialized in earnest. Long before the show started at 7:30 p.m.,
all three parking lots at the Skirball Center were full, even at $5
per spot. Vehicles were being turned away, fists were shaking in
anger, and one reporter had to flash press credentials to weasel her
way in. Others not so fortunate lined up outside, gazing forlorn at
the crowd of about 1,500 who spilled inside a courtyard set against
the backdrop of a rugged hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very surprised--there are a lot of people there," remarked
singer Miho Hatori, one half of the New York-based group who
performed a soothing mix of Brazilian covers and original
compositions accompanied by musicians playing maracas, bongo drums
and stand-up bass.</TE>
<TE>   Silky-haired and silky-voiced, Hatori sang sweetly melancholy
tunes in Portuguese, as the dusk descended. On "Tristeza E Solidao,"
a song made popular by Brazilian bossa nova great Baden Powell, she
was joined by Smokey Hormel, who strummed his acoustic guitar
throughout the show.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up about three miles from here," Hormel said pointing
toward the hills of Bel-Air--or was it Beverly Glen? "So much has
changed since then. We used to have cougars up here; what we have now
is Lexus," he noted in somewhat mysterious syntax. The
upscale-looking audience chuckled at the first part of his
observation, not at the latter.</TE>
<TE>   As Smokey &amp; Miho sang into the night, it was time to hit the last
stop of the music marathon: the Santa Monica Pier, where
Algerian-born Rachid Taha enthralled a crowd of several thousand with
his pop take on rai.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of dogs and small children augmented the usual assortment of
boardwalk denizens--beautiful young people and the homeless. Taha,
who looked like a Middle Eastern Ricky Martin in a tight-fitting top
and snug shiny pants, sang to the backing of a lute player, two
guitars and a hand-held drum. He groaned plaintively as the crowd
gyrated to the Middle Eastern rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   It came as no surprise to see a middle-aged man with one foot in a
cast shaking his crutches to the rhythm: Taha's infectious blend of
pop and Maghrebi rhythms sounded like it would incite the lame to
walk.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno Comet, on vacation from Paris, was dancing up a storm close
to the stage. "Now is not the time to talk, it's the time to enjoy
the music," he said in his native tongue, sweat dripping off his
forehead.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd roared, the ocean hummed nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Another Kerouac line came to mind: "All around me were the noises
of the crazy gold-coast city." It's good to know that among those
noises, there is music to be enjoyed aplenty.</TE>

<HD>New Publications for Fall Arts</HD>
<DH>The demise of Performing Arts magazine has left arts
centers scrambling to find another guide. L.A. and Orange County are
finalizing contracts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just in time to meet their fall season deadlines, two of Southern
California's largest performing arts centers--downtown's Los Angeles
Music Center and Orange County Center for the Performing Arts in
Costa Mesa--have found new program publishers to replace the defunct
Performing Arts magazine.</LD>
<LD>   After more than 35 years of using Performing Arts magazine as the
glossy package for their program information, the resident companies
of the Los Angeles Music Center--the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los
Angeles Opera, Center Theater Group and the Los Angeles Master
Chorale--confirm they are finalizing contracts with a local
publisher, Southern California Magazine Group, to provide a new
program magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Center for the Performing Arts has also found a
publisher close to home: Todd Bentjen, vice president of marketing
and communications for the center, confirmed that the Orange County
Register will publish programs for OCPAC, its resident companies and
presenters: the Philharmonic Society of Orange County, which oversees
the annual Eclectic Orange Festival; Pacific Symphony Orchestra and
Opera Pacific.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to find new publishers was made necessary by the
recent demise of Performing Arts magazine. In early June, the monthly
publication became a casualty of an East Coast publishing coup:
Playbill magazine, the program publisher for most Broadway theaters,
acquired its longtime archrival, Stagebill.</TE>
<TE>   Stagebill had purchased Performing Arts magazine last year, and
Performing Arts went to Playbill as part of a package deal.
Performing Arts will go out of business Sept. 1, although Playbill
may exercise its right to use the Playbill or Performing Arts names
for new publications at some future date.</TE>
<TE>   The coup left theaters scrambling for a new program publisher in
time for their 2002-03 seasons, most of which begin in September.</TE>
<TE>   The new, as-yet-untitled magazine for the Music Center will be
distributed at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark
Taper Forum and Ahmanson theaters, as well as Hollywood Bowl and Walt
Disney Concert Hall, when it opens in 2003. The publication will make
its first appearance Sept. 4 at Chandler Pavilion for Los Angeles
Opera's season opener, Puccini's "Girl of the Golden West."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Magazine Group, headed by Jeff Levy, is also
the Southern California franchisee of Where magazine, an
international publication that provides local entertainment
information for hotel guests. Levy's company also publishes guides
for some Southern California tourism departments.</TE>
<TE>   Playbill negotiated with Music Center resident companies for the
contract, but director of marketing and communication Catherine
Babcock said the smaller size of Playbill was a major deterrent;
Playbill is about 5 inches by 8 inches, compared with the about
8-by-10-inch Performing Arts format. "We felt a larger format, with a
larger font, is what our audiences have come to expect," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy called the new venture a logical offshoot of Where magazine,
which includes local performing arts information. He said he has
already hired the key advertising and sales executives from
Performing Arts to work on the new publication, although he has not
absorbed the old editorial staff.</TE>
<TE>   Like Performing Arts, the new magazine will eventually hire a
staff of editors who will work with freelance writers to provide
stories about arts and entertainment. Levy would not specify the
length of his contracts with the Music Center but said they are "long
term."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other area theaters are also opting for arrangements
other than Playbill. The Pasadena Playhouse, Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts and UCLA Center for the Performing Arts will publish
their own programs as a stopgap measure until another option can be
explored.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of venues don't have much choice at this point, it's such
an impending deadline," said Nicole Cavazos, public information
officer for the UCLA center, which opens its fall season Sept. 13
with the Kronos Quartet. "Our publishing knight in shining armor has
not appeared."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brian Colburn, general manager of Pasadena Playhouse: "We're
now in the publishing business, for the foreseeable future. We're
going to see how we do with it; we have a few more options, a little
bit more flexibility when we print our own program; we can give more
space for recognition for our donors and sponsors. Our goal is to
break even, but also meet some institutional objectives. We're not
going to make any rush decisions, but if we have a good experience,
we'll go with it."</TE>

<LD>Susan King's excellent report on casting against type
("Typecasting--Not," July 24), touched off by Tom Hanks'
tommy-gun-toting assassin in "Road to Perdition," might also have
included some of the roles Tom Cruise--that all-American
boy-next-door--has limned that are counter to his image in the bulk
of his filmography.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last few years, he has appeared in "Magnolia" as a smarmy
self-help guru, a turn that earned him an Oscar nomination, his
third; in "Interview With the Vampire" as a sexually ambivalent blood
sucker; and in Stanley Kubrick's ill-conceived valedictory, "Eyes
Wide Shut," as a sexually adventurous hedonist and husband of Nicole
Kidman's character.</LD>
<LD>   All this in a career that has included enacting the protagonist in
a wide range of mainstream films--"Top Gun," "Risky Business," "Far
and Away," "Mission: Impossible" (both of them), "Jerry Maguire,"
"Born on the Fourth of July" and the current "Minority Report," among
many others.</LD>

<TE>   Anne Valdespino's article thoroughly articulated the challenge
faced by filmmakers when it comes to the decision whether to employ
foreign accents ("Acting in the Thick of Accents," July 23). It seems
with "K-19," Hollywood has once again underestimated the intelligence
and tolerance of moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   As an audience, we have to suspend our disbelief enough as it is.
Now we are asked to overlook Harrison Ford's odd-sounding Russian
accent? He's not supposed to have an accent when speaking to his own
people. He's Russian!</TE>

<TE>   When Samuel L. Jackson says it's not his job to assist rap artists
to become screen performers (Morning Report, July 23), he has my
sympathies in spades, but his comments raise two bothersome issues.</TE>
<TE>   In objecting to granting these amateurs status on the level with
established actors, he cites as examples himself alongside Morgan
Freeman, Laurence Fishburne and Forest Whitaker. So I have to wonder
why it is he identifies so exclusively in terms of color. He might
have included Ben Kingsley, Kevin Spacey and Bruce Willis. It's
unfortunate that he restricts his comparisons so tightly when his
talent runs far beyond such boundaries for many, if not most, of his
fans.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, my agreement with his thesis would elicit more
encouragement if it included sports heroes. Rare is the case when a
good actor comes to the screen from a football field, a wrestling
ring or a weight room.</TE>

<TE>   In your recap of posthumous Emmy winners ("Director Wouldn't Be
the First to Win Posthumously," by Susan King, July 19), you failed
to mention character actress Alice Pearce. Pearce played the
Stephens' nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz on "Bewitched" for two years
and died of cancer just a few months before winning the Emmy for best
supporting actress in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   She pretty much set the standard for portraying the neighborhood
busybody, and to this day whenever I know someone who thrives on
gossip or loves to snoop, I refer to them as being just like Gladys
Kravitz.</TE>

<LD>What a nostalgic pleasure it was to read about all those old
submarine movies ("In the Periscope: Submarine Standouts," by Susan
King, July 24.) And what a lot of them they've made! So why not make
even more? It seems like all they need for one is to construct a
small set out of boilerplate and pipes, then jiggle the camera,
indicating near misses by depth charges, while the actors fall about
and the stagehands squirt water through chinks in the bulkheads.</LD>

<LD>I don't know what "media" that Susana Sierra believes "fail to see"
the flaws in Elvis Presley and the Beatles (Saturday Letters, July
20). I don't recall any lack of coverage when Paul McCartney and
then-girlfriend Jane Asher were charged with drug possession or when
John Lennon and Yoko Ono were threatened with deportation. And I
can't think of a musical figure in history who's been the subject of
more negative press than Elvis, who was initially predicted to be the
downfall of civilization.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, since Presley, Lennon and George Harrison are dead and
Ringo Starr now lives a relatively low-profile life, their escapades
no longer create headlines. But if you told Sinead O'Connor, Eminem,
Tommy Lee, George Michael, Robert Downey Jr., Winona Ryder or Robert
Blake that they receive special dispensation from negative press
coverage because they are "white artists," they'd laugh in your face.</LD>
<LD>   The crash-and-burn lifestyles of Janis Joplin, John Phillips,
Keith Moon, Jerry Garcia--even Calista Flockhart's carbohydrate
consumption--have all been reported in mind-numbing detail.</LD>
<TE>   Michael Jackson is the victim of his own inability to accept the
fact that actions have consequences--not just for the Joe and Marge
Sixpacks of the world but for everybody. Does he truly believe that
all of us who bought "Thriller" have suddenly become infected with a
Tommy Mottola-generated strain of satanic racism and, as a result,
are refusing to buy one of the most expensively produced, heavily
promoted but musically insignificant albums of the 21st century?</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, I think he does.</TE>

<LD>Great idea to cast Jason Alexander and Martin Short in "The
Producers" ("Alexander and Short Will Team for L.A. 'Producers,' " by
Don Shirley, July 12). But how about going one step further and
having them alternate the roles, as John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour
Hoffman did so memorably with "True West" in New York a couple of
years ago? Just a thought.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No question that Jason Alexander and Martin Short are among the
most talented of comedy artists; however, methinks Alexander is too
young to play the role of the ever-scheming Max Bialystok and Short
is too old to portray the youthful and super-neurotic Leo Bloom.

<HD>He Gave Country to the World</HD>
<DH>Series of concerts celebrates the work of Ralph Peer, who
began recording 'hillbilly music' 75 years ago this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called "the Big Bang of country music," an explosion that shook
tiny Bristol, Tenn., 75 years ago this week, and eventually vibrated
throughout the world. In terms of cultural impact, it's almost as if
one person found and first recorded the Beatles and Bob Dylan in the
same week.</LD>
<LD>   On July 25, 1927, record company scout Ralph Peer, having lugged a
load of clunky recording equipment from New York to Bristol, started
recording "hillbilly" singers for his employer, the Victor Talking
Machine Co. (later to become RCA Records). Within a few days of each
other, Peer stumbled on the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, seminal
figures in what became known as country music.</LD>
<LD>   A series of concerts and special events started Thursday in that
region and continues through Aug. 4, celebrating the anniversary and
legacy of the recordings known today as "the Bristol Sessions."</LD>
<TE>   Anyone who thinks this is just the realm of historians and
musicologists need look no further than this week's country music
charts to find the ongoing ripples generated by the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Toby Keith's No. 1 hit "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The
Angry American)" is the type of "event song" that Peer favored and
was especially looking for on his venture to Bristol. Kenny Chesney's
"The Good Stuff" is a celebration of family and home akin to much of
what made backwoods singers A.P., Sara and Maybelle Carter famous
nationally. And Brad Paisley's good-humored "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The
Fishin' Song)" echoes the footloose and fancy-free attitude that was
a central part of Rodgers' rapid rise to fame.</TE>
<TE>   "You take those same songs, give them a modern arrangement and
today they can still be very popular. The success of the 'O Brother,
Where Art Thou?' soundtrack proved that," says Bill Hartley,
executive director of the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance in
Bristol, which is sponsoring concerts by Appalachian-rooted artists
including Earl Scruggs, Loretta Lynn and Doc Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Other performances will feature descendants of the key musicians
Peer brought to the world 75 years ago: the Carters, dubbed the first
family of country music; Rodgers, known as the father of country
music; and Ernest V. "Pop" Stoneman, a carpenter whose early country
hits about the Titanic and other disasters lured Peer to the
mountains of east Tennessee looking for more raw talent.</TE>
<TE>   The songs by the Carters ("Will the Circle Be Unbroken," "Wildwood
Flower," "Keep On the Sunny Side") and Rodgers ("Blue Yodel [T for
Texas]," "Any Old Time," "In the Jail House Now") have profoundly
influenced generations of musicians, from Hank Williams and Bill
Monroe to Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash to Emmylou Harris and the
Dixie Chicks. They also affected the development of folk music as
played by Woody Guthrie and, in turn, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen
and others.</TE>
<TE>   The Carters and Rodgers also established traditions that continue
to be practiced today.</TE>
<TE>   "They represent two different traditions in country music," notes
John Rumble, senior curator at the Country Music Hall of Fame and
Museum in Nashville. "Rodgers represented the rambler, the solo
singer with a guitar talking about his travels while still longing
for the pleasures of home. The Carter Family represents the domestic
tradition, emphasizing family and home."</TE>
<TE>   Even Peer's act of recording them, Rumble says, "represented a
reaching out to the roots-based or folk-based styles that have really
distinguished American music for 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Hartley notes that Peer, who later founded a music publishing
company, was savvy: "He recognized the potential of coming to this
region. Other labels might not have thought this music could sell
beyond a rural market. But Peer realized they could have national
significance."</TE>
<TE>   While rock, country and folk artists have recorded songs by the
Carters and Rodgers countless times in succeeding decades, the
original recordings also live on. The Country Music Hall of Fame put
out a two-disc set in 1987 containing those early Peer recordings.
"The Bristol Sessions," which generated two Grammy nominations, is
still in print, and compilations culled from hundreds of Carter
Family and Rodgers recordings are reissued year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "Those early recordings are hard to hear and that can make it hard
to appreciate how good they were," says Mark Zwonitzer, co-author
with Charles Hirshberg of a new biography, "Will You Miss Me When I'm
Gone? The Carter Family &amp; Their Legacy in American Music" (Simon &amp;
Schuster, $25).</TE>
<TE>   Yet, as Zwonitzer writes in the book, "[e]ven from the wheeziest
Victrola, their voices ricocheted off the bone, because they leaned
so hard on their own notions of tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   "One of my dreams," he says, "is to be able to be in a room when
they were making this music. But there's something in that music that
still grabs people. They keep playing them and making new versions of
them."</TE>
<TE>   In large part that's because those songs were more intensely
personal than most that had been recorded before them.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the nieces of the Carters said to me, 'All their songs had
deep-gutted meaning, because they were about feelings that somebody
had actually felt,' " Zwonitzer says.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that keeps drawing people to this music is the
pure, simple sound of it," says Hartley.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't necessarily want to hear something that's
commercialized, prepackaged and manufactured for them. They want to
hear music from the heart," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "And you find a lot of that in this music. For a lot of these
people, that's why they got started, because they truly love singing
and have a gift that they want to share with other people."</TE>

<HD>He's Writing--but Bearly</HD>
<DH>Forgoing his usual themes of romance and redemption, John
Hiatt does songs for Disney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer-songwriter John Hiatt has written hits for Bonnie Raitt, Jeff
Healy, Eric Clapton, Suzy Bogguss and B.B. King. Bob Dylan covered
one of his tunes. "The Thing Called Love" wasn't just a hit, it was
also the title of a country music movie starring River Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   And he's conjured memorable semi-autobiographical lyrics, often
dealing with his past problems with alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   "I was gonna get up off-a that bar stool, just as soon as I could
figure it out," Hiatt growls in a song about hitting the boozy
bottom, "Paper Thin."</LD>
<TE>   So it's a little disconcerting to hear his gravelly, bluesy
baritone coming out of a bear's mouth in a Disney children's film,
Disney's "The Country Bears," which opened Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, stranger things have happened," he says with a laugh. "I've
always thought of myself as kind of bruin-like."</TE>
<TE>   "He may be from Indiana, but he sounds like he's from the Ozarks,"
Tennessee-based music critic Wayne Bledsoe says of Hiatt, who has
made Nashville and environs his home for years. "He's the perfect
choice to play a singing bear."</TE>
<TE>   And at 50, maybe it's time for the cult figure country-rocker to
check in with a new audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hear from kids who dance around to 'Riding With the King' or
'Perfectly Good Guitar' at my live shows," he says. "So I've always
felt like the kids kinda dig me. Maybe kids like the simplicity of my
music. Rock is about arrested development. It's not about the
maturing process."</TE>
<TE>   So he's reaching out to the younger crowd. It happened because
Country Bears director Peter Hastings is a fan. He approached Hiatt's
agent.</TE>
<TE>   "A bunch of people working on the movie got on a plane, flew in to
see me in Oregon, where I was playing at the time," Hiatt says. "Next
thing I know, there's these nutters from Hollywood sitting around a
table trying to explain to me this band of bears and how they were
gonna get a movie out of them."</TE>
<TE>   Hiatt's been to Disneyland. "So I know the bears, man." But the
filmmakers lost him. Then Hastings explained it in a way Hiatt could
understand.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as Hastings told me it was 'Spinal Tap With Paws,' I knew
I was in," Hiatt says, laughing. He wrote a batch of songs: "Let It
Ride," "Where Nobody Knows My Name," "The Kid in You," "Straight to
the Heart of Love," and the filmmakers kept adding more and more of
them to the movie. "Started out, they were using two. Ended up with
something like seven."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote tunes sung by Raitt and Don Henley, by Jennifer Paige and
E.G. Daily. And he sang some himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like building a ship in a bottle," he says. "For this, I had
to look at it from another point of view. You've got to be in this
band of bears. And let me tell you, it's not that hard to do. Ever
been in a rock 'n' roll band? All rock musicians are bears.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote the tunes, and they built situations around them. It was
a little tough, because all I had to go on was the script."</TE>
<TE>   Hiatt's favorite themes of self-discovery, romance, redemption
from the perils of the bottle and the like went by the wayside.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're writing for yourself, it's your baby. When you're
writing for film, it's the director's baby. You're just aiding and
abetting. You have to meet the filmmaker halfway."</TE>
<TE>   More than one music critic has noted that Hiatt's complex
lyrics--clever phrases that in lesser hands would turn his tunes into
"ditties"--require more than one hearing to be fully understood. In
"Memphis in the Meantime," he sings, "Get your Chevette together." In
"Thing Called Love," the verse goes, "I ain't no porcupine; take off
your kid gloves."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always trying to simplify what I write," says Hiatt. But even
though he was writing for kids, "I didn't feel I had to write down to
the audience for this."</TE>
<TE>   And like the late Roger Miller, the country music legend whose
live show was forever changed the minute he did songs for a Disney
film ("Robin Hood"), Hiatt is already prepping his band, the Goners,
for a little flavor of the Mouse on their current tour. They've added
"Let It Ride," from the movie, to their playlist.</TE>
<TE>   Plug that one in with the title cut from his last album, "The Tiki
Bar Is Open," about pre-Disney Florida, recovering from alcoholism
and the death of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, and you've got an
interesting set.</TE>
<TE>   "That song came out of a week in Daytona Beach, the week before
the 500 the year he got killed," Hiatt says. "I was driving home and
I got the news he had died. The song is all about Florida, tourist
imagery. I saw the sign, 'The Tiki Bar Is Open,' hanging outside this
little mom-and-pop hotel in Daytona Beach. It was a comfort to know
those are still around, even if I don't drink.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the shuttle being launched. And Dale was killed the week I
was there. So it's just a little sketch of life there, at least for
the week I witnessed it."</TE>

brought "All in the Family," "The Jeffersons," "Maude" and "Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman" to television, turns 80 today and is surprised
at the attention his birthday has attracted.</LD>
<TE>   "When you hit 80, things accrue to you that are not reality," he
told the Associated Press at his summer home in Shaftsbury, Vt.
"Suddenly I am far wiser than I truly am. Suddenly I know more than I
ever did. I stand and walk straight. I can still lift a coffee cup to
my lips and people think, 'Isn't it a wonder! Look at that. He's 80!'
"</TE>
<TE>   He watches little television these days, although he thinks HBO's
"Six Feet Under" is brilliant and praises the hundreds of choices
viewers now have.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me what's the golden age of television, and I say this
is the golden age of television," he said. "Whatever you want is
there over that vast array of channels."</TE>
<TE>   Bush Opts for CBS on Sept. 11 Anniversary</TE>
<TE>   CBS "60 Minutes II" correspondent Scott Pelley landed a big
exclusive when President Bush agreed to an interview about the
aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks</TE>
<TE>   The journalist, who will interview Bush in the Oval Office and in
Air Force One, aims to produce a video version of a Washington Post
series reconstructing the administration's response to the World
Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.</TE>
<TE>   CBS hopes to make its broadcast the definitive video record of
that historic day, said Pelley, who will also speak with other top
White House officials.</TE>
<TE>   The interview, to be shown during the network's Sept. 11
prime-time coverage, will be the only one the president gives to mark
the anniversary, according to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been attractive under any circumstance," Pelley
said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "But the fact that this is going to be an exclusive interview with
the president ... raises the stakes of this enormously and raises the
profile of this broadcast enormously."</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   New Artistic Chief for Shakespeare Company</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old Royal Shakespeare Company, immersed in operational
and artistic turmoil, has appointed Michael Boyd, an associate
director of the group, as artistic director. He'll replace Adrian
Noble in March.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Belfast, Boyd is known as one of Great Britain's more
original interpreters of Shakespeare. Last year, he won an Olivier
Award--the London equivalent of a Tony--for a cycle of plays he
directed.</TE>
<TE>   During a press conference reported in the New York Times, he
mapped out his plan of action. Among his goals: keeping the company
flexible so it can change with the times and facilitating the
participation of big-name artists like Vanessa Redgrave and Ian
Richardson by paying them more and eliminating unwieldy contracts
that require them to give up other acting opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the company moved away from its long-standing "ensemble"
approach, seeking to attract a broader range of talent.</TE>
<TE>   The company vacated the Barbican Center, its London home since
1982, staging productions in a host of theaters on and off the West
End that are often only half full. Most upsetting to traditionalists,
it has announced its desire to demolish its Stratford-on-Avon
headquarters and build a new theater.</TE>

<TE>   Cassidy Selling Big Years After Her Death</TE>
<TE>   A new album of previously unreleased recordings by pop-jazz singer
Eva Cassidy, who died of melanoma in 1996, at age 33, will be issued
on Aug. 20, but it is already generating heavy pre-release orders at
Amazon.com.</TE>
<TE>   The album, "Imagine," at one point was the Web site's top-selling
album and has hovered in the Top 10 in recent days, based on early
orders. At her death, the native of Washington, D.C., left a number
of recordings, some of which were issued on albums released in 1998
("Songbird") and 2000 ("Time After Time").</TE>
<TE>   The new collection includes the rest of her unreleased studio
recordings along with some live performances recorded in
Washington-area clubs. Among the songs are Gordon Lightfoot's "Early
Morning Rain," Sandy Denny's "Who Knows Where the Time Goes" and Paul
Anka's "It Doesn't Matter Anymore."</TE>

<HD>To Reach This Film School, No Commute Is Required</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man in Antarctica, one of the first 90 students to sign up for
the Global Film School, was thrilled to finally be able to study
cinema through the new online school. He only had one question. "He
was wondering if he could get the textbooks sent to him by e-mail,"
said Frank Stork, the school's chief executive officer. "He only gets
mail once a year, in September."</LD>
<LD>   Launched in May by UCLA and film schools in Australia and England,
the for-profit online film school is believed to be the first of its
kind. In its first trial months, it has generated both excitement and
some confusion. The students--many of whom live in
non-English-speaking countries--are not equally skilled in English;
they've had problems obtaining the required textbooks or videos in
their countries; and they live in a variety of time zones, forcing
some students to sign on to live chat class at 2 a.m. And some
students have had to deal with a few technical glitches, such as
being dropped accidentally from a chat room.</LD>
<LD>   Still, judging by the students' response to the classes and
willingness to pay the per-class fees (now an average of $500,
increasing to $700 in September), Stork believes he's tapped a viable
market for the entrepreneurial venture. "There's a real demand from
aspiring filmmakers willing to pay a fair amount of money to get real
instruction from top instructors," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Not only does Stork predict the school will turn a profit within
18 months, he says its educational goal is honorable and
revolutionary: "It's the democratization of film education," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The school is associated financially and academically with UCLA
but has yet to be accredited. So far, it offers only two courses:
"Screenwriting Fundamentals" and "Elements of Great Filmmaking,"
taught by UCLA's Richard Walter and the University of Arizona's Yuki
Makino. There is also a free seminar, "Shoot Out!," about the
day-to-day realities of Hollywood filmmaking, hosted by Peter Guber,
chief of Mandalay Entertainment, and Peter Bart, editor in chief of
the trade paper Variety.</TE>
<TE>   The online classes, similar to those offered by UCLA's film
school, are divided into a maximum of four sessions with 15 students
each, Stork said. The professors lecture through downloaded videos,
which students watch on their own time. In addition, instructors lead
live chat sessions on the Internet, and give feedback to students
though e-mail. Students also interact with one another twice a week
for more than an hour in online chat sessions.</TE>
<TE>   E-learning isn't for everyone but seems to work best for aspiring
students who are either geographically or physically challenged, or
are already working professionals. Fifty-five percent of Global Film
School students live outside the U.S. and include a former
cinematography student now serving time in prison, a quadriplegic in
Denmark and a 16-year-old enthusiast from Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   As it looks now, the $4-million online school is a vastly
scaled-down version of the $25-million venture announced several
years ago during the dot-com boom. Back then, it was said 90,000
potential students had expressed interest. It was an unrealistic
vision coupled with bad timing, said Stork, who was hired by the
Global Film School a year ago. Last year's approval by the University
of California regents was a "time-consuming and painful process," and
when it was over, so was the dot-com boom, he said. "I came on to
lend business ability and sobriety to the project," he said.
"Everyone was still dreaming of the hundreds of millions of dollars
of equity values and revenues."</TE>
<TE>   Stork said he recognized the school had to go beyond concepts and
create a credible revenue-generating business before it could go
outside and raise capital. "It wasn't easy to do, frankly," he said.
Learning from the University of Phoenix example, he scaled back the
"bells and whistles" of technology to focus on content. His salary
and that of the professors will be paid from a portion of the profits
later.</TE>
<TE>   Through bulletin boards and live chat rooms with other students
around the world, they've heard different points of view from all
kinds and levels of enthusiastic students. "That's something you
can't find everywhere," said Hector Mora, 24, a student in Colombia,
via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The initial courses were limited, Stork said, so that the school
could test price and class content. A third session of courses will
be launched soon with additional courses: "Screenwriting Workshop"
and "Concepts in New Media."</TE>
<TE>   Mora said he reviews the material as many times as he wants to,
and at his own time and pace. He was surprised he had to work so
hard. "You have to write and send reports," he wrote. "For people
outside the U.S., this could be hard because of the language. In my
case, I must say that my writing skills has [sic] been forced to
improve whether I was ready or not."</TE>
<TE>   Takayuki Ito, 29, a management consultant in Japan who aspires to
become an independent filmmaker, said in an e-mail that he hopes the
screenwriting class will help prepare him for graduate-level
filmmaking classes he plans to take later in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the paying students, more than 1,000 "auditors"
have signed on to the "Shoot Out!" series, found at
www.shootoutonline.com and based on a UCLA class that also spawned a
book of the same title. They have heard agent Bob Bookman, director
John Singleton, actors Angelina Jolie and Matthew Perry, and Tom
Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, relate professional
experiences. Stork said the school is converting the seminar series
into a paid course with additional materials and live instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention was to do this as a gift," said Guber, the former
Sony Pictures chairman, who has taught courses regularly at UCLA for
33 years. Aspiring filmmakers today have easy access to digital
cameras and editing suites, but lack access to experienced
professionals who can help guide them in the storytelling process, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As it grows, the school hopes to evolve into a sort of talent
clearinghouse where agents and producers can see the actual films of
some of the students. Fox Searchlab, Fox Searchlight's director
program, will award a scholarship to the top candidate from Global
Film School's international student base. The candidate will be flown
to L.A., where he or she will receive a first-look deal with Fox
Searchlight.</TE>
<TE>   The school has applied for accreditation. It also is studying
whether to impose admissions requirements and is considering
scholarships to remove cost barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the school succeeds, some questions remain. Can anyone
really learn filmmaking on a Web site? Can anyone have a successful
filmmaking career without living in one of the filmmaking centers?
Will Americans, long criticized for imposing their cultural values on
the rest of the world through movies, spread their domination through
the school?</TE>
<TE>   Noam Dromi, publicist for shootoutonline.com, said, "We take the
position that once you've established a certain level of success in
the entertainment industry, you can live anywhere you want. The way
the town works, you can benefit from spending time in L.A." Stork,
who is Dutch by nationality and has lived in several countries, said
one reason he was hired was for his international viewpoint. "Had
they hired someone American, it may have become too much of a
Hollywood-focused enterprise," he said. "We're not limiting it to
American instruction to the world. From our perspective, Hollywood is
part of the global product base. It's the most prevalent, the most
profitable and popular. Hollywood knows how to develop the films and
market the films. They're not always the best stories, but the
best-sold stories.</TE>
<TE>   "What we hope to do is broaden that. A Spanish student taking a
course from a Chinese professor may come up with an entirely new and
different story technique, which may be impossible where students go
to their indigenous film schools." On the other hand, there's
something to be said for that as well, he said. "We don't want to
destroy a country's film culture."</TE>
<TE>   According to the University of Arizona's Makino, her students,
many of whom are Americans living abroad, tend to have independent or
eclectic tastes: "Clearly, they're not in a position to be able to do
huge-budget-type films."</TE>
<TE>   Stork said, "There's a certain level of arrogance from the
Hollywood perspective. They think they don't need schools to find the
talent, that the talent will naturally always gravitate to Hollywood.
It's not the case. There are a lot of talented actors in the world
who are not able to realize that passion. Film schools are out of
their reach. We hope we're opening a door to a whole new group of
talented individuals out there."</TE>

<HD>A Diary About Today's America</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can a film illustrate complex issues with relatively cardboard
characters and dialogue? That's the conundrum of "Our America," which
received accolades at Sundance in January and premieres on Showtime
Sunday at 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Based on a true story, the 95-minute movie focuses on LeAlan Jones
and Lloyd Newman in Chicago's South Side. After a 1993 audition, the
teens were selected by producer David Isay to create a "diary" for
National Public Radio.</LD>
<LD>   Isay (Josh Charles) trains the strait-laced Jones (Roderick
Pannell) and troubled Newman (Brandon Hammond) to use radio
equipment. For one week the teens document their daily routine, from
the gantlet of alcoholics and gangbangers they run on their way to
school to the hardscrabble stories of friends and relatives.</LD>
<TE>   The film shows how their effort, a candid project titled "Ghetto
Life 101" that aired in November 1993, won awards but also drew
critics who claimed that the African American boys were manipulated
by their white producer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our America" really could be two movies, with the first half
dramatizing this experience. The second half follows Jones and Newman
as they pursue the story behind a 1994 incident on their home turf,
in which two young boys were convicted of first-degree murder. Their
Peabody Award-winning report finds out what motivated the killers,
while dissecting urban life's woes.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with director-cinematographer Ernest Dickerson's film,
with a teleplay by Gordon Rayfield based on the NPR trio's book, is
the woodenness of many of the characters as well as the script. The
staginess offsets some of its grittiness. (A note to parents:
Showtime has rated it TV-PG, though there are harsh expletives.)</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "Our America" will make you think twice the next
time you hear a tragic story from "the bad part of town" that seems
so far away but is actually quite close to home.</TE>

<HD>Film Society May Help Save Theater</HD>
<DH>Movies* The American Cinematheque is negotiating to help
run Santa Monica's historic Aero, which has had financial trouble for
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinematheque is in negotiations to help run the historic
Aero Theater in Santa Monica by using it as part of the
Cinematheque's classic film screening programs. The Cinematheque, a
21-year-old nonprofit film society, which owns the Egyptian Theater
in Hollywood, would invest in upgrades for the venerable Aero,
including new seats, projection equipment and concession stand.</LD>
<LD>   No contract has yet been signed, but Barbara Smith, the
Cinematheque's executive director, is optimistic.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it is very beloved in the community," Smith said in an
interview this week. "It's a great example of a neighborhood theater
and it has its own history for people who live there."</LD>
<TE>   The Aero, which shows second-run films at discount ticket prices,
has been in financial trouble for the past decade, according to Chris
Allen, who operates the theater, located on Santa Monica's tony
Montana Avenue. Allen has not been involved in the Cinematheque
negotiations, which have been handled by the Aero's owner, Jim
Rosenfield. Smith said: "Jim is very committed to it being there and
to having it stay a single screen. He's gone out of his way to make
sure that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Allen plans to hold two benefit showings of the James Dean classic
"Rebel Without a Cause" on Wednesday night in case the Cinematheque
deal falls through.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still here and I'm still trying to keep this theater going,"
said Allen. "It could be just like the Sundance deal, which didn't
happen, and then what?"</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, Robert Redford, who saw his first movie at the
Aero as a child, planned to acquire the theater and turn it into an
art house devoted to showing independent film. That deal fell through
when Redford's Sundance Cinemas' joint venture with General Cinemas
shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   The 550-seat Art Deco-style theater has plenty of colorful
history. Built by the Douglas Aircraft Co. in 1939, it used to screen
movies around the clock for employees who lived in the neighborhood
and walked over when they got off shifts at all hours of the day.</TE>
<TE>   But in these days of flashy multiplexes trimmed in neon and set in
entertainment malls with restaurants, espresso bars and boutiques,
the Aero is a dinosaur. It never shows first-run movies, has no
parking lot, no cup holders in the armrests and no fresh popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who has been running the theater since 1996, said he would
often get behind on rent payments but he always seemed to catch up.
Then in 1996, attendance fell off, due mainly to the popularity of
Blockbuster video and the Santa Monica Promenade drawing customers
away, Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured out I lost about 2,000 to 2,500 people [who were
regular customers]," he said. "That is a small number but that's
enough to throw it off balance."</TE>
<TE>   In the past month Allen has served as a one-man publicity
campaign, calling local publications, appearing on KCRW and
distributing 3,500 fliers in the neighborhood asking the community to
help save the Aero.</TE>
<TE>   Other Los Angeles landmarks have been saved in recent years by
larger theater chains. The Regent Theater in Westwood was acquired by
the Landmark specialty chain and has been doing decent business
showing art films. Dot-com millionaire Robert Bucksbaum bought the
single screen Crest Theater, also in Westwood, continuing to feature
family fare but also using the theater for special events and
promotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a growing interest in revitalizing Los Angeles'
historic theaters," said Ken Bernstein, director of preservation
issues for the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit historic
preservation organization. He noted some success stories like the
Egyptian, and the Orpheum theater downtown, which was rehabilitated
with a $3-million cash investment last year by its owner, as part of
the Conservancy's Broadway revitalization program. But, he said,
"there are still many theaters in a precarious state." Bernstein said
it is the neighborhood movie theaters that suffer most because they
bear the brunt of the competition from the megaplexes, including the
Golden Gate Theater in East L.A., which has been vacant for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Aero may be outdated but some locals maintain their affection
for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," said Paul Kraemer, 70, a retired health care
consultant who lives in Pacific Palisades and has been going to
movies at the Aero for 20 years. He stopped to reminisce before a
recent Saturday matinee of "The Emperor's New Clothes," starring Ian
Holm. "It takes me back to my childhood. And here you can see things
you missed in other theaters."</TE>
<TE>   McKeown said it will take more than talk to save the theater. "We
all say we love the Aero but if we want it to survive we have to
become customers again. The Aero is great because you can walk there,
see a movie and walk home holding hands, talking about the movie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Rebel Without a Cause" screens at 6 and 9 p.m. Wednesday at the
Aero Theater, 1328 Montana Ave., Santa Monica. Tickets are $20 and

<HD>Bankruptcy Code Reform: A Primer</HD>
<DH>Finances: Legislation would require credit counseling
before and after filing and make it tougher for some to avoid paying
creditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bankruptcy reform legislation, which is virtually certain to become
law, would usher in sweeping changes for the more than 1 million
Americans who file for protection from creditors each year.</LD>
<LD>   What should consumers expect from the new law and how should they
react? Here are some answers:</LD>
<LD>   Question: What does the new law do?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It completely revamps the nation's Bankruptcy Code,
requiring new tests for debtors and new obligations for attorneys.
Though the bill would affect some corporate reorganizations, it's
biggest effect would be on consumer bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the biggest changes in store for consumers?</TE>
<TE>   A: "Means" tests would be required for many debtors who wish to
wipe out their bills under a liquidation, or Chapter 7 bankruptcy
filing, in which consumers turn over virtually all of their nonexempt
assets in return for a clean slate.</TE>
<TE>   Under current bankruptcy law, Chapter 7 filers don't have to repay
their creditors, even if their income would allow at least partial
repayments. Under the proposed law, if a judge determines that a
debtor could pay back a significant portion of his debts within five
years, the debtor would be required to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers also would be required to get credit counseling before
and after filing bankruptcy. And the bill proposes new limits on the
number of times an individual can unload debts in bankruptcy or have
legal actions such as foreclosures stalled by a filing.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy attorneys also would be required to do more research
into their client's financial condition and would be subject to
sanctions if they improperly file liquidation proceedings for a
debtor who does not qualify.</TE>
<TE>   The changes probably would increase the time it takes to discharge
a bankruptcy, which is likely to boost attorneys' fees and the
overall cost of filing, said Jack Williams, professor of bankruptcy
law at Georgia State University College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, parents owed child support would go to the
front of the creditor line, getting paid before credit card firms and
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does the means test mean fewer people will be able to file
bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. But it might mean people who in the past would have filed a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy will have to file under Chapter 13 instead. In
Chapter 13 filings, consumers can keep more of their assets as long
as they agree to pay all or most of their debts over time.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed law, those with sufficient income would be
required to file under Chapter 13, and a trustee would determine how
much of their debt can be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's considered sufficient income?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's an open-ended question. If you earn less than the median
income in your state, you are automatically exempted from the means
test and you can file under Chapter 7, as you can under current law.</TE>
<TE>   If you earn more, you are subjected to the test, but those who can
prove they can't repay a significant portion of their debts within
five years still would be allowed to file under Chapter 7 no matter
how large their income, said Andy Caine, a Los Angeles bankruptcy
attorney and president of the American Bankruptcy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The determination of who can and can't repay their debts would
hinge on how much the individual has after paying fixed expenses,
including home mortgage or rent, car payments and allowances for
food, clothing, insurance and other necessities. There's a fair
amount of latitude with these expenses, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the education requirements and how would they affect
consumers?</TE>
<TE>   A: The most important of the education provisions, said one
bankruptcy judge, requires debtors to get certification that they
have gone through a budget review with a certified credit counseling
agency before they're allowed to file bankruptcy. Because many
bankruptcies are filed on the spur of the moment--usually to
forestall foreclosure or repossession of a car--this requirement
could delay a bankruptcy filing long enough to cause the foreclosure
to be completed before the consumer could get court protection.</TE>
<TE>   Once this law is in effect--probably within six months of
enactment--consumers should consider getting a budget review and
counseling certificate the moment their finances become tight enough
to cause a single missed car or mortgage payment.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would you lose pension, IRA or 401(k) assets in a bankruptcy
under the new law?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. Like the old law, this measure would protect qualified
retirement assets from creditors, no matter how much is set aside in
these accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the new limits on how many times you can discharge
debts in bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   A: Under the new law, debts could be discharged under Chapter 7 no
more than once every eight years, compared with once every six years
under current law. In addition, those who file bankruptcy frequently
to thwart foreclosures or repossessions would be barred from getting
court protection for those assets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Key Points in Bankruptcy Reform Law</TE>
<TE>   * A certificate stating that the consumer has gone through a
budget review by a credit counseling agency will be required before a
bankruptcy filing will be accepted.</TE>
<TE>   * After bankruptcy, consumers will be required to take financial
education courses.</TE>
<TE>   * The maximum number of Chapter 7 discharges will be limited to
one every eight years, compared with one every six years under
current law. Repeat filers also will be restricted from getting
automatic stays from foreclosure and repossession.</TE>
<TE>   * Parents owed child support will rise in repayment priority.
Their debt will be repaid before credit card companies or attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   * Consumers' ability to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidations
will be subject to an evaluation of the ability to repay debts if the
individuals earn more than the median income in their state.</TE>

<HD>5 Firms' Execs Vouch Early on Accuracy of Financial Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies such as FedEx Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. are certifying the
accuracy of their financial statements before the starting date set
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to PepsiCo and FedEx, the chief executives and chief
financial officers of at least three other companies have filed the
required certifications with the SEC. They include AMR Corp., Fiserv
Inc. of Brookfield, Wis., and Delphi Corp. The SEC released
certifications from those five companies Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Confronted by a wave of corporate scandals at companies such as
WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp., the SEC recently adopted rules
requiring the CEOs and CFOs of 947 U.S. companies to attest that
financial reports filed with the agency are accurate and complete.</LD>
<TE>   Under the rules recently adopted by the SEC, companies don't have
to begin submitting the certifications until Aug. 14, but documents
released by the agency Friday show that some executives are getting
ahead on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not do it right away?" said Kenneth Jensen, the chief
financial officer of Fiserv, a provider of information management
technology to banks and brokerages. "We filed our statements so we
might as well file our certifications too."</TE>
<TE>   Other companies said they believe they can get a public relations
edge by filing ahead. An early filing permits the firms to distance
themselves from those plagued by accounting scandals, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The language in the certifications adheres to guidelines
recommended by the SEC on June 28. Each CEO certified under oath that
"to the best of my knowledge," his most recent annual reports filed
with the SEC didn't contain an "untrue statement of a material fact"
or neglect to include a material fact.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Thomsen, deputy director of enforcement at the SEC, recently
said she expected more companies to revise financial statements
before having their CEOs and CFOs swear that their financial
statements are on target.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The $136-million sale of Dick Clark Productions Inc. to a group of
private investors was finalized this week, company executives
announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Dick Clark Productions, founded in 1957, will continue as an
independent television production company, with Clark staying on as
chairman and chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of the agreement, announced five months ago, company
stockholders received $14.50 a share in cash. Clark received $12.50 a
share for a portion of his holdings; however, he transferred much of
his shares into the acquiring entity, as did the company's chief
operating officer, Francis La Maina, who stayed on as president.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday was the final day of trading of Dick Clark Productions
stock on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The acquiring investors include artist management firm Mosaic
Media Group, CDP Capital Communications, Claridge/Andell Group and
television producer Jules Haimovitz. Haimovitz is a former president
of King World Productions Inc. and Spelling Entertainment Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "This will give Dick more support," said Haimovitz, who now is
vice chairman of Dick Clark Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Mosaic, which produced the hit Warner Bros. movie "Scooby-Doo,"
has become the principal shareholder of the production company.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Patent Case Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, a federal judge in North Carolina on Friday dismissed
the rest of a patent infringement lawsuit Gemstar-TV Guide
International Inc. and SuperGuide Corp. had brought against EchoStar
Communications Corp., EchoStar announced.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Lacy H. Thornburg previously granted
EchoStar's motion to dismiss most of the suit, which contended that
Littleton, Colo.-based EchoStar violated three of SuperGuide's
patents for on-screen program guides for satellite TV services.
Pasadena-based Gemstar had licensed the technology from SuperGuide in
North Carolina, and both companies sought to enforce the patents
against EchoStar. Thornburg also ordered Gemstar and SuperGuide to
pay EchoStar's legal fees.</LD>
<LD>   The case was one of several major patent lawsuits by Gemstar,
which holds nearly 200 patents for the software used in television
program guides. That software is critical in an era when cable and
satellite TV operators offer hundreds of channels.</LD>
<TE>   Still pending are cases before the International Trade Commission
and federal courts in North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. An
administrative law judge at the ITC ruled last month that EchoStar
and two cable set-top manufacturers had not violated Gemstar's
patents, sending Gemstar's already depressed shares tumbling further.
Gemstar has appealed the ruling to the full commission.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Gemstar rose 12 cents to $4.09 on Nasdaq. The ruling was
announced after markets closed.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Puts Banker in Enron Probe on Leave</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. put investment banker Schuyler Tilney on
leave Friday after he said he would not testify before a U.S. Senate
subcommittee investigating the fall of energy trader Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Tilney, 46, decided not to testify Tuesday after he learned the
Department of Justice was probing a deal that the Senate is
reviewing. Tilney, who is head of Merrill's energy and power group,
arranged a $7-million equity investment for a company Enron set up to
operate energy-generation barges.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill said that based on what it knows, its employees acted
properly in deals with Enron.</LD>
<TE>   "However, it is placing the employee on administrative leave
because the company's policy is to cooperate fully with governmental
and regulatory inquiries," Merrill said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Associated Press reported that the federal task force
investigating Enron met with investigators for the California Senate
committee investigating the state's energy crisis to review documents
the committee obtained under subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Six investigators from the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office met
with state Senate investigators for four hours July 15 and have had
several telephone discussions since then, said a legislative source
close to the investigation. Another source close to the investigation
confirmed the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators indicated they were interested in potential criminal
fraud in electricity trading, as well as possible securities fraud,
one source said.</TE>

<HD>GE Capital to Split in 4 in Surprise Shake-Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. on Friday announced a surprise shake-up of its
profit-driving financial services arm, splitting GE Capital into four
separate parts in a bid to give investors a sharper picture of the
unit's operations and results.</LD>
<LD>   GE Capital, which generates 40% of GE's earnings, will be split
into insurance, commercial finance, consumer finance and equipment
units, each reporting to GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt and Vice
Chairman Dennis Dammerman.</LD>
<LD>   GE Capital CEO Denis Nayden is leaving the position to form his
own financial services advisory company. He will remain as a senior
advisor to Immelt.</LD>
<TE>   Immelt said that he has been considering the move since he took
office.</TE>
<TE>   GE, a wide-ranging conglomerate with a hand in everything from TV
stations to insurance, has drawn criticism for its sometimes oblique
earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note that questions have been raised about how GE
accounts for its pension and post-retirement costs, and Immelt has
acknowledged the scrutiny, saying the company is working to provide
greater clarity.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Neal will be in charge of commercial finance, David Nissen
will lead consumer finance, Arthur Harper will run equipment
management and Michael Fraizer will be in charge of the insurance
group.</TE>
<TE>   The change is effective Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Both Nayden and Immelt declined interview requests, Bloomberg News
said.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric has maintained its AAA credit rating--the highest
available--for 46 years, the longest of any company, according to

<HD>Gold Plunges on Stronger Dollar</HD>
<DH>Markets: Demand for greenbacks increases as stocks rise.
'Safe-haven' metal may have trouble holding on to gains, analysts
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold plunged again Friday, closing out its worst week in 2 1/2 years
as the dollar strengthened and stocks stabilized, reducing the
metal's allure as an alternative investment.</LD>
<LD>   Gold for August delivery fell $6.40 to $303.40 an ounce on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
closing price for a most-active contract since April 19. The loss for
the week came to 6.4%--the biggest one-week drop since December 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The greenback, meanwhile, had its biggest weekly gain against the
euro and yen in more than a year, making gold more costly for buyers
using those currencies. And the Dow Jones industrial average had its
first weekly increase in three weeks, although the outlook for the
overall market remains murky.</LD>
<TE>   This week's decline in gold prices has been "mainly because the
dollar looks like it's stopped falling and is going to bounce back a
bit," said John Bridges, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in New
York. "For now, there's less concern about the general markets,"
Bridges said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold stocks also fell. The Philadelphia gold and silver index slid
6.3% to its lowest level since Jan. 3. Gold prices jumped this year
as the worsening stock market meltdown prompted investors to seek
relative safety.</TE>
<TE>   The metal peaked at a 2 1/2-year high of $331.50 an ounce June 4.
Gold, still up 8.7% for the year, may have difficulty holding on to
the gain, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "Safe-haven buying in gold never lasts long," said Leonard Kaplan,
president of Prospector Asset Management. "When people see the stock
market go up and down drastically like it has, they just want to get
out of all of the markets."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, investor demand for greenbacks climbed as the three
most closely watched U.S. stock indexes gained, analysts said. The
dollar has moved in the same direction as stocks on nine of 10 days
during the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   "The dollar is pretty much in step with the equity market," said
Brian Taylor, head trader at Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Co. in
Buffalo. Foreigners will have "a lot more confidence" to invest in
the U.S. if stocks continue to fare better than European shares, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar strengthened 2.4% against the euro this week, its
biggest weekly gain since March 2001. It closed Friday at 98.8 cents
per euro, down from $1 on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The greenback had fallen to a 2 1/2-year low against the euro July
19 as declines in U.S. stocks reduced demand for the currency.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar also had its biggest one-day jump in 14 months against
the yen, rising to 118.85 yen from 116.49 on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "With the rebound in U.S. stocks and the poor performance
elsewhere, we are seeing more investors repatriating their money back
to the country," said Ben Ghalmi, a Europe specialist at Alliance
Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in Japanese stocks Friday pushed the Nikkei-225 stock
average to its biggest weekly decline in almost 1 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   The increased investor interest in gold was reflected in a rise in
sales of American Eagle gold coins to a six-month high of 26,500
ounces in June, the U.S. Mint said this month.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is an erosion of the false sentiment which
pushed prices up," said Howard Patten, an analyst at Barclays Capital
in London. "There wasn't a great deal of fundamental strength to gold
prices" at the levels they had reached, he said.</TE>

<HD>Health Net Lifts Freeze for New Medi-Cal Enrollees</HD>
<DH>Health care: The HMO reverses a policy that cut off access
to Tenet doctors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health Net Inc. said Friday that it was rescinding a controversial
policy that had prevented new Medi-Cal enrollees from accessing
scores of doctors and 10 hospitals affiliated with Tenet Healthcare
Corp. in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The big health maintenance organization this month imposed the
restriction for new members of Medi-Cal, the public insurance for the
poor and disabled, in part to pressure Tenet to give ground in
protracted contract talks.</LD>
<LD>   But Health Net's action drew criticism from physicians and
consumer advocates and was being scrutinized by state regulators who
were concerned about potential violations of patients' rights.</LD>
<TE>   Health Net said previously that its policy was aimed at reducing
the risk of patient harm if negotiations broke down and resulted in
the termination of contracts. The freeze steered Medi-Cal enrollees
who signed with Health Net away from about 20 medical groups and
hospitals owned by or affiliated with Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net, which has one of the state's largest Medi-Cal
enrollments with almost 600,000, said members had plenty of other
doctors and hospitals to choose from. Some patients and doctors
complained the policy was not only limiting choice but disrupting
care for families.</TE>
<TE>   "It was inappropriate," said Steven Thompson, vice president for
government relations at the California Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In lifting the freeze, Health Net officials said Friday that their
company and Tenet had made progress this week in what has been a
yearlong dispute over reimbursement rates. Neither side would give
details about the contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Health Net was sued late Thursday by the St. Joseph
Health System, which operates hospitals and doctors' groups in Orange
County. St. Joseph and Health Net severed relationships at the end of
last year, but St. Joseph said it sued to recover more than $18
million in unpaid or underpaid claims. David Olson, a Health Net
senior vice president, said the two sides had been in discussions
about claims but that the amount was overstated.</TE>

<HD>KPMG Gets Probation in Orange County Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm KPMG was put on probation for a year for alleged
gross negligence and unprofessional conduct that contributed to
Orange County's 1994 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Accountancy on Thursday placed the international firm
on probation and ordered it to pay $1.8 million in fines and costs.</LD>
<LD>   KPMG's lead audit partner, Margaret Jean McBride, cut corners and
ignored warning signs as then-County Treasurer Robert L. Citron filed
false accounts and faked interest earnings, the ruling said.</LD>
<TE>   McBride, who still heads KPMG's government audit section in Costa
Mesa, received three years' probation and 100 hours of community
service.</TE>
<TE>   Two auditors each got two years of probation.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's investment pool collapsed in December 1994,
resulting in a loss of $1.7 billion and the nation's largest
municipal bankruptcy filing. Citron was forced to resign after
revealing the losses.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG plans to appeal the decision.</TE>
<TE>   The probation terms require KPMG's government auditing section to
undergo investigation, and staffers must take classes, said Greg
Newington, the board's enforcement chief.</TE>

<HD>Stocks End Wild Week on Upswing</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The Dow halts its brutal losing streak, but
Friday's modest gains leave investors with mixed signals about the
future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quietly ending a tumultuous week on Wall Street, stocks finished
modestly higher Friday as investors assessed whether the market can
sustain a rebound from its devastating plunge this year.</LD>
<LD>   Tentative buying in the final hour lifted the Dow Jones industrial
average 78.08 points, or nearly 1%, to 8,264.39. The advance helped
the blue-chip index notch its best weekly gain since the onset of a
brutal 10-week sell-off, fueled by scandal and disappointing
earnings, that has depleted investors' confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Bargain hunting in the technology sector enabled the Nasdaq
composite index to rise 22.04 points, or 1.8%, to 1,262.12. The
benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 14.16 points, or 1.7%,
to 852.84.</LD>
<TE>   About three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York
Stock Exchange; winners outnumbered losers by almost 4 to 3 on
Nasdaq. Trading volume was well below the records of recent days.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow index gained 3.1%, its best showing since
the week ended May 17, and the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.6%. But Nasdaq fell
4.3%--its fourth straight weekly decline--and the tech- and
telecom-laden index has lost a stunning 35.3% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, meanwhile, fell again to finish its worst week in 2 1/2
years. Another upswing by the U.S. dollar and the lull in the stock
market's rout further diminished gold's appeal as a safe-haven
investment, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying Friday's modest gains on Wall Street were continued
declines in some key sectors, such as semiconductors and wireless
communications. Those losses tempered hopes that the market can build
on its startling rally Wednesday, when the Dow soared 6.4% for its
biggest one-day percentage gain since October 1987.</TE>
<TE>   After a "climactic" week like this, it is not unusual to see
activity slowing down as investors calculate their next moves, said
Edward Nicoski, chief technical analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis. For now, he said, "investors have no idea what to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, investors face decidedly mixed signals as they guess
whether the market has bottomed or will drop further. Many stocks
were at five-year lows at midweek.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dollar and blue-chip indexes have firmed--at least
for now--consumers' confidence in the economy has fallen sharply
since June, according to a University of Michigan report Friday. Yet
economists had expected an even steeper decline. This week the
government reported June declines in durable goods orders and sales
of existing homes.</TE>
<TE>   Upbeat comments from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. about semiconductor
stocks helped some of those issues climb Friday. But the sector
overall--as measured by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's chip-stock
index--slipped nearly 1% to 315.01, lowest since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, the market's ability to brake its plunge provided
some solace after a wild week, in which stocks gyrated in response to
passage of a landmark corporate reform bill, the arrest of insiders
at Adelphia Communications on fraud charges and the bankruptcy filing
by WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   And although skepticism abounds that the market can keep chalking
up gains, some analysts see positive developments. Barton Biggs,
chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients
that bearish sentiment toward the market is so deep that "stocks
around the world are poised for a powerful rally."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's firming this week also bodes well for stocks, Nicoski
said. Investors around the world are heavy with cash, and with a
stronger dollar, he said, "I think we're going to see money come back
into the U.S.," with much of that cash funneled into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco International soared $3.78, or 46%, to $12.03 after the
troubled conglomerate named Edward Breen, Motorola's president, as
chairman and chief executive. Motorola fell $1.28, or 11%, to $10.90.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Paul Cos. advanced $2.80 to $27. The insurer's planned sale
of $760.1 million of securities eased concerns about a shortage of
capital after the company postponed the sale of its reinsurance unit.</TE>
<TE>   * Electronic Arts rose $2.64 to $58.36. The biggest U.S. maker of
video game software earned 5 cents a share in the fiscal first
quarter as it sold more games for personal computers and consoles.
Analysts had forecast an 8-cent loss.</TE>
<TE>   * Among tech giants, Microsoft rose $2.52 to $45.35, Oracle gained
32 cents to $9.33, and Intel added 33 cents to $17.81.</TE>
<TE>   But IBM dropped $2.95 to $66.40 and was the biggest drag on the
Dow and S&amp;P 500. The loss resulted from speculation the company faces
weak PC demand and has underfunded its pension fund.</TE>

<HD>Tainted Meat Prompts Outcry</HD>
<DH>Food: Critics call for reform of U.S. safety inspection
rules after the latest recall, which involved 19 million pounds of
ground beef.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week's recall of 19 million pounds of hamburger exposed major
weaknesses in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's inspection
program, according to politicians and consumer groups, who are now
seeking reform of federal meat inspection regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The recall, the second-largest of its kind in U.S. history, was
ordered after E. coli-tainted meat from a ConAgra Foods Inc. plant in
Colorado sickened at least 28 people in seven states. Critics
maintain that the federal government suspected potential problems
months ago and should have acted then.</LD>
<LD>   Top USDA officials acknowledge some of the weaknesses in their
food safety inspection procedures, and the agency has pledged to
notify plants and their customers more quickly when contamination is
discovered. But consumer advocates say the moves are not nearly
enough to protect consumers from tainted meat.</LD>
<TE>   With business reform on the minds of many Americans, House and
Senate Democrats want to impose penalties on companies that produce
unsafe meat. And industry watchdog groups are calling for a
congressional investigation into the events leading to the massive
meat recall, which is still being linked to more illnesses around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "The ConAgra recall is not an aberration. It is another example of
a food safety system that is teetering on the brink of collapse,"
said Wenonah Hauter, a director with consumer group Public Citizen.
"It's time for the Congress to take a good, hard look into USDA food
safety policies and how they are implemented."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, critics have blasted the USDA's Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point food safety program, a relatively new program
that replaced the old "sniff and poke" approach performed by
government inspectors at private plants.</TE>
<TE>   Because the program allows companies to do their own testing for
E. coli, critics say it gives plants leeway to overlook potentially
unsafe products and makes it difficult for inspectors to intercept
tainted meat.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, both the General Accounting Office and consumer groups
have complained that the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is
understaffed to handle the fast-moving lines at today's huge plants,
and its inspectors are poorly trained and slow to sanction plants
turning out tainted products.</TE>
<TE>   E. coli O157:H7, the type found in the ConAgra meat, is one of the
more virulent strains of bacteria spread between animals by
manure-contaminated water. It rests in the intestines and is mixed
into meat during butchering.</TE>
<TE>   Infections from this particular bacteria cause severe diarrhea and
abdominal cramps in most people; in the elderly and young children,
it can cause kidney failure and even death.</TE>
<TE>   Because it is potentially deadly, the USDA should have acted more
quickly to warn consumers after it was discovered, consumer advocates
say.</TE>
<TE>   USDA officials waited 11 days after inspectors discovered E. coli
0157:H7 downstream from the Con- Agra plant that regrinds its meat
before warning the company and recalling 354,200 pounds of their
hamburger.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 19 days went by and a dozen illnesses were reported
before the agency widened the recall to 19 million pounds produced
between April 12 and July 11.</TE>
<TE>   As early as February, USDA officials had ignored urgings from its
own field inspectors to investigate ConAgra's Greeley, Colo., plant,
after it was strongly suspected of supplying E. coli-positive meat to
Montana Quality Foods &amp; Processing, another meat processor.</TE>
<TE>   After the meat tested positive, inspections officials refused to
test other unopened packages that Montana owner John Munsell thought
might help pinpoint the source of the contamination. Testing
continued at Munsell's plant, and after three consecutive positive
tests, inspectors then asked for a sample from the original lot that
tested positive. By that time, Munsell said he had sold all of the
product.</TE>
<TE>   And without the sample, inspection officials said the
investigation wasn't justified. Munsell then took the matter to Sen.
Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.) who in May--long before July's
epidemic--met with USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety Elsa Murano on
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   But still the agency took no action.</TE>
<TE>   The USDA's unwillingness to move against companies also was
apparent to congressional investigators studying the USDA's meat
inspection program. Of 68 enforcement cases last year, USDA
inspectors informed 60 plants that they would have to stop meat
production because of food safety violations, says a report expected
to be published by the General Accounting Office this fall. However,
in 95% of the cases, they did not follow through on their warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Murano acknowledged that since taking office last year she has
found some of the same "weaknesses" that GAO investigators found and
is working to correct them. The agency is providing further training
for the inspectors already stationed in plants, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Murano also has appointed a new deputy for field operations to
crack down on incomplete or inaccurate record keeping by inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   And as of the ConAgra recall, the USDA has changed its policy to
immediately inform plants and their customers when illness-causing
bacteria is discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Murano also signaled her intent this week to widen the scope of
meat recalls, pulling an entire day's production when a plant tests
positive for illness-causing bacteria, as the agency did in the
ConAgra recall, rather than a single lot of the product.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the industry are speculating that the sweeping ConAgra
recall also could lead to a broader test-and-hold policy at meat
plants, where a day's production of meat would be held until the
results of bacterial sampling come back.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would be costly, requiring the construction of much
more refrigerated warehouse space and ultimately cost consumers more
at the supermarket, said Jeremy Russell of the National Meat Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Although management of the USDA's Hazard Analysis Critical Control
Point food safety program has drawn a great deal of criticism, the
bigger problem appears to be the program itself, which was adopted by
meat companies after 1997's Hudson Foods recall in Nebraska, the
largest in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   The program does not mandate regular testing for E. coli 0157:H7.
Instead, the agency takes 5,000 random samples a year at plant
locations and supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   If a plant's own test records show it has not tested positive for
six months, the agency stops sampling from that plant, a policy that
critics say encourages companies to take samples from only the least
suspect parts of a carcass.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors are there to make sure a company's food safety plan is
followed, and the plant kept clean, even though in most cases
inspectors have not reviewed these plans to make sure they are
effective.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to come up with treatments that will kill the bacteria
on the spot, Murano said.</TE>
<TE>   ConAgra's procedures of steam-treating and acid-washing carcasses
to get rid of E. coli bacteria didn't work, Murano said.</TE>
<TE>   USDA inspectors will require ConAgra to come up with another plan
to assure the agency it can turn out safe beef. However, the agency
does not have the authority to immediately shut them down or issue
fines for dangerous products, Murano said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Reps. Lynn N. Rivers (D-Mich.) and
Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) introduced legislation this week that would
change that. They also are seeking the authority to levy civil fines
against offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Also, California Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) sent a
letter to Murano's boss, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman, asking
her to explain the agency's delay in ordering the recall after
contamination was first discovered.</TE>
<TE>   But microbiologists say the USDA also should devote more of its
resources to head off E. coli before it hits the plant, whether it's
developing feed with beneficial bacteria that kills E. coli in the
gut or vaccines to immunize animals against it, said Michael Doyle,
head of University of Georgia's Center for Food Safety and Quality
Enhancement.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government needs to address this at the farm," Doyle
said. "Issues with animals turn into issues with people."</TE>

<HD>Port Talks Suspended; Tension Rises</HD>
<DH>Labor: Dockworker union takes initial step toward a strike,
which shippers say would hurt a fragile U.S. economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contract negotiations covering about 10,000 West Coast dockworkers
grew increasingly tense Friday as the union suspended talks for
nearly three weeks and, for the first time, officially broached the
possibility of a strike.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of West Coast locals transferred the power to call
for a strike vote to the negotiating committee--strengthening that
panel's bargaining clout. The change is incremental, and union
officials insist they have no plans to shut down the ports. Even so,
retailers who depend on the ports to move goods were rattled.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Joe Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime
Assn., which represents major shipping lines in the negotiations,
called the actions "a threat to an already fragile economy" that
could endanger "the economic well-being of millions of Americans."</LD>
<TE>   The parties have been negotiating for three months. They appeared
to be making progress two weeks ago, when the union offered to accept
new technology that it said would eliminate hundreds of marine clerk
jobs. But the union rejected a counter-offer that it said would have
allowed for the outsourcing of International Longshore and Warehouse
Union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA maintains that its offer, which includes early retirement
packages, job guarantees and a 17% average wage increase over five
years, is generous.</TE>
<TE>   The postponement came after a weeklong union caucus by about 80
representatives of union locals, who unanimously rejected the PMA
offer. Caucus members then voted to transfer the ability to call for
a strike vote to the negotiating committee.</TE>
<TE>   ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone said the union still views a strike
as a last resort, and that the committee would have to mail ballots
to all members for authorization before calling one--a process that
would take weeks. "There is no crisis here," he said. Negotiators
called the break so they could meet with rank-and-file members in
their home ports, Stallone added.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn added his voice to the chorus of
officials urging both sides to reach a negotiated agreement. In
conversations Friday with the PMA's Miniace and ILWU President James
Spinosa, Hahn said he was assured that neither side would take any
actions to slow the flow of goods before talks resume in August.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration and California state officials also have
been monitoring the talks.</TE>

<HD>Spin Doctor, Heal Thyself: PR Group Is the Other Worldcom</HD>
<DH>Names: The association faces the problem of being mistaken
for the unrelated telecom company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worldcom Public Relations Group is in the middle of its own public
relations nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based association of more than 100 spin agencies
around the world wants everyone to know it is not now--and never has
been--associated with WorldCom Inc., the telecommunications company
that filed for bankruptcy protection this week.</LD>
<LD>   "It just so happens our name is the same," said Hal Dash, a board
member of the group founded in 1988. "We have absolutely no
relationship with them. We had the name before they did."</LD>
<TE>   The nation's No. 2 long-distance provider and parent company of
MCI adopted the WorldCom name in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a public relations expert might gently suggest this would
be a good time for a name change. Dash said the board is having none
of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a ... catchy name," he said. "Of course, these days
it's catching something else."</TE>
<TE>   The group was not always so adamant. It was willing to change its
name when the phone company came calling in 1996--for the right
price.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a nonprofit and they were a company that had zillions of
dollars," Dash said. "We wanted to know if they wanted to pay us for
the name. Basically, they blew us off. I guess they thought they
could outlast us."</TE>
<TE>   USC business professor William Crookston, who specializes in
marketing and public relations, believes that it's in the group's
best interests to hold on to the scandal-tinged Worldcom moniker.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing about a brand name," he said, "is that it should
be on everyone's lips."</TE>
<TE>   Even when those lips are scowling?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Crookston said. "It gives them a chance to quickly
explain they are not part of the WorldCom telecom. It turns a
negative into a positive, and nobody forgets their name."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, "you know that old saying about publicity: 'It
doesn't matter what you say about me as long as you spell my name
right.' "</TE>
<TE>   The origins of the Worldcom name for the PR organization are a
mystery. "I think it just referred to the fact that we are a
worldwide group that works in the communications field," Dash said.
"It wasn't rocket science."</TE>
<TE>   The small and mid-size agencies that make up the group often
depend on one another to handle situations outside their areas of
expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Dunkin, president of Worldcom's Americas wing and managing
principal with Standing Partnership in St. Louis, said that when one
of her clients--a chain of movie theaters--filed for bankruptcy
protection, her firm brought in an expert from a member agency in
Cleveland who had a lot of experience with Chapter 11 companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the telecommunications company would want to talk to him,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Being the less well-known of the two Worldcoms, the public
relations group has had to work at differentiating itself. Especially
lately.</TE>
<TE>   Dash said he has gotten a lot of ribbing from clients and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "They call up and say, 'Are you still here?' " he said. "Or a
vendor might say, 'Maybe I should get payment in advance.' It's all
kidding around."</TE>
<TE>   Being in the business, Dunkin has given some thought as to what
she would tell executives at the other WorldCom if asked for PR
advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I would tell them they have to be honest, ethical and open in
their communications," Dunkin said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they have had some lapses in that, but that's what I would
be telling them to do from now on."</TE>
<TE>   The most famous piece of advice in the PR industry is that there
is no such thing as bad publicity. Perhaps having the same name as
WorldCom is, for this group, a blessing in disguise.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say that," said Dash, suddenly demur. "Maybe
there is a bit of a silver lining in all this for us."</TE>

<HD>Bill Proposes Royalty Relief for Webcasters</HD>
<DH>Internet: A measure in the House seeks to help stations
facing possibly crippling payments to record labels and artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to complaints from hundreds of Webcasters, 10 members of
Congress proposed Friday to give most Internet radio stations
temporary relief from the royalty payments they must make to record
companies and artists.</LD>
<LD>   Their bill, introduced by Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), comes one
month after Librarian of Congress James H. Billington set a royalty
rate of 0.07 cent per song, which amounts to $92 per listener per
year for Webcasters playing a steady diet of music. Many small
Webcasters said that rate would drive them out of business, and more
than 50 companies have taken their stations off the Web.</LD>
<LD>   Inslee's bill would overhaul the arbitration process used to set
royalties, making it easier for small businesses to participate and
probably resulting in a lower rate. Until a new rate is set, Internet
radio stations that fit the federal government's definition of a
small business would not have to pay.</LD>
<TE>   But with online advertising slumping and the Webcasting industry
in its infancy, most online broadcasters currently qualify as small
businesses, representatives of the recording industry said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the bill would force labels and artists to subsidize
the financially troubled Webcasting industry, said John L. Simson of
SoundExchange, a subsidiary of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America that collects digital broadcasting royalties. He urged
Congress to let small Webcasters, labels and artists work out a
compromise on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We might have been a convenient scapegoat," Simson said, "but if
you look at all their numbers, they were losing tens of thousands of
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Inslee said the bill was needed to fix problems caused by Congress
when it established the process for setting royalties in 1998. The
arbitration process was so expensive that small businesses "had no
real way to participate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, Inslee said, arbitrators had to base the
royalties on the deals that labels and Webcasters had negotiated
privately. But there was only one, between the RIAA and Yahoo Inc.,
so the resulting rate did not truly reflect market conditions, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The first payments are due in mid-October, when Webcasters will
have to pay almost three years of back royalties, amounting to about
$260 per listener for full-time online broadcasters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Avaya Inc., the biggest U.S. maker of office-telephone equipment,
will eliminate 2,500 jobs, or about 12% of its work force, amid a
slump in demand.</LD>
<LD>   The company will set aside $150 million in its fiscal fourth
quarter for cutting jobs, closing offices and terminating leases, as
well as the declining value of assets, it said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Since Avaya was spun off from Lucent Technologies Inc. in October
2000, the company has cut about 7,200 jobs, or 24% of its work force.
The latest round of job cuts brings the company's payroll to 19,100.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer sentiment has been bruised this month but improved in the
last two weeks, as Americans have proved resilient to the merciless
stock market sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   But even as auto-buying incentives and the ability to refinance
mortgages at lower rates boosted their assessment of current
conditions, consumers continued to fret about the economy's outlook.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment index for
July fell to its lowest level since November 2001, to 88.1 from 92.4
in June, market sources said. That was better than economists'
forecasts for 86.5, where the index stood at mid-month.</LD>
<TE>   The current-conditions index, intended to measure Americans'
perception of their financial situation and their willingness to
spend on household items such as furniture, was 99.3, better than a
previously reported 99. It was 99.5 in June.</TE>
<TE>   The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to
five years, was 81, down from 87.9 in June but better than the
previously reported 78.5 for this month.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit has been filed by a former employee of Herbalife
International Inc., alleging that a former chief executive of the
Century City-based maker of nutritional supplements subjected her to
sexual harassment and battery.</LD>
<LD>   Samantha Faulkner, according to the suit, rose from the post of
executive assistant to Herbalife founder Mark R. Hughes in 1990 to
executive vice president of corporate services in 1999 with a salary
of $535,000. But, the suit alleged, her fortunes with the company
took a severe turn after the death of Hughes in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Faulkner's attorneys charge that she was subjected to verbal and
physical harassment by former Herbalife Chief Executive Christopher
Pair. They also allege an incident in which she was sexually
assaulted and battered by Pair in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit also names the company and Conrad Klein, executive
vice president and chief business affairs officer, for, among other
things, failing to stop the harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Klein and Herbalife attorneys called the lawsuit frivolous and
said that it was completely without merit or factual support. Pair,
who left Herbalife in October, was unavailable for comment.</TE>

<LD>Top executives from three of the nation's most troubled
telecommunications firms will appear before a Senate panel Tuesday
morning to testify about the industry's woes and how to protect
customers from service disruptions at ailing firms.</LD>
<LD>   The executives include John W. Sidgmore, chief executive and
president of WorldCom Inc.; John Legere, chief executive of Global
Crossing Ltd.; and Afshin Mohebbi, president and chief operating
officer of Qwest Communications International Inc. They will testify
after a panel discussion featuring Michael K. Powell, chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, which this week submitted the nation's largest
bankruptcy filing, has admitted to hiding $3.9 billion in expenses to
boost earnings. Global Crossing, also in bankruptcy proceedings, and
Qwest are both subjects of separate government accounting probes.</LD>
<TE>   Officials of the Senate Commerce Committee said the hearing's
focus will be on industrywide problems and their effects on
consumers, but that some questions may involve accusations of
wrongdoing.</TE>

<LD>A man sued four leading fast-food chains, claiming he became obese
and suffered from other serious health problems from eating their
fatty cuisine.</LD>
<LD>   Caesar Barber, 56, filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Bronx Supreme
Court, naming McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried
Chicken.</LD>
<LD>   Barber, a 5-foot, 10-inch maintenance worker who weighs 272
pounds, had heart attacks in 1996 and 1999 and has diabetes, high
blood pressure and high cholesterol.</LD>
<TE>   He said he ate fast food for decades, believing it was good for
him until his doctor cautioned him otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Barber said there is no history of heart disease or diabetes in
his family. He said he started eating fast food in the 1950s because
it was cheap and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Anderson, president of the National Restaurant Assn.,

<HD>Sprint Shares Spiral Down on Rumors</HD>
<DH>Telecommunications: The firm issues an unusual denial that
it is experiencing a cash crunch. The plunge reflects investors'
distrust of the sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. shares fell as much as 26% on Friday as skittish traders
reacted to rumors that the nation's No. 3 long-distance provider
faces a cash crunch.</LD>
<LD>   The stock's abrupt plunge, which sent shares in Sprint's core
business to their lowest level in more than a decade, illustrates
Wall Street's severe distrust of the telecommunications sector and
shows investors' fear of being stuck in yet another big industry
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at Overland, Kan.-based Sprint tried to calm investors
by taking the unusual step of issuing a statement to deny the rumors.
Sprint released a detailed accounting of its cash and available
credit lines and said it has not tapped any of its bank credit lines
and has no plans to do so because it has sufficient cash to fund
operations beyond 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Investors reacted tepidly to Sprint's comments, allowing the
company's stock to rebound only slightly from its intraday low of
$6.65. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Sprint's FON shares, which
reflect the local and long-distance phone business, closed at $7.05,
down $1.95, and shares in PCS, Sprint's wireless business, fell 70
cents to $3.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take much to panic people these days in the telecom
space," said Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Co., which doesn't own
Sprint's two stocks but rates both "outperform." His firm has done
banking for Sprint.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint has $20.3 billion in long-term debt and lease obligations.
It has $1.85 billion in cash and available credit, including $650
million in cash at the end of June. In addition, Sprint has a
$2-billion credit line that expires next month and is renegotiating
terms for a separate $3-billion credit line.</TE>
<TE>   The carrier wants its banks to remove a requirement that the
company's debt ratings stay above "junk" levels.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of its peers, Sprint's credit rating has not fallen
below investment grade, but its rating may change because of its
deteriorating financials. Sprint reported a consolidated
second-quarter loss, and its phone unit reported lower sales for the
sixth straight quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After watching cash-rich WorldCom Inc.'s financial health go from
bad to bankruptcy in a matter of weeks, investors are closely
watching Sprint's debt payments and credit lines, said analyst F.
Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. He doesn't own Sprint shares, and

<HD>Venture-Capital Spending Falls as Returns Lag</HD>
<DH>Investments: Survey says cautious firms have scaled back.
Health-care start-ups gain favor at the expense of tech sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venture capitalists are still having a hard time finding places to
invest their funds.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. venture-capital firms, struggling with lagging returns,
invested $5.06 billion in the second quarter, 43% less than a year
earlier, according to the latest survey by Ernst &amp; Young and
VentureOne.</LD>
<LD>   Industry spending was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1998
when $4.86 billion was invested, the survey of 1,200 firms found.</LD>
<TE>   Firms put new money into just 143 companies in the second quarter,
down from a peak of 819 in the first quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Initial investments in companies also fell by half to $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Venture-capital firms have scaled back as the tumbling stock
market has hurt their returns. Some have stopped investing in new
companies and a dozen firms have slashed the size of their funds.
Others have said they won't raise another fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the current state of the capital markets, it's
understandable that venture capitalists are holding back on
technology investments," said Chris Bruner, venture capital advisory
group leader at Ernst &amp; Young. "The large corporations that are
potential customers of tech start-ups are in a state of upheaval,
making paths to profitability unclear."</TE>
<TE>   Companies in the computer and telecom industries drew 58% less
investment, falling to $2.49 billion from $5.97 billion a year
earlier, according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care companies, which gained favor as Internet companies
stumbled, attracted 17% more investment, which rose to $1.75 billion
from $1.49 billion, accounting for more than one-third of all
venture-capital investments.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned about the record-low number of reported seed and
first-round deals," Bruner said. "If new companies aren't being fed
into the pipeline, there may be a long-term impact on future economic
development."</TE>
<TE>   This also may affect returns, Bruner said.</TE>
<TE>   Venture-capital firms typically finance multiple companies at a
time, betting a few will generate outsized profits to make up for the
failures.</TE>
<TE>   Venture-capital spending peaked at $26.9 billion in the first
quarter of 2000 along with the Nasdaq composite index.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index is down 75% from its high.</TE>

<HD>AOL Time Warner's Outlook Revised</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook for AOL Time Warner Inc. on
Friday to "negative" from "stable" because of weak operating
performance at the media company's America Online unit.</LD>
<LD>   The credit rating agency affirmed AOL's BBB-plus corporate credit
rating, its third-lowest investment grade.</LD>
<LD>   A negative outlook suggests conditions are present that may lead
to a downgrade, not that a downgrade is imminent.</LD>
<TE>   AOL shares fell 45 cents in after-hours trading after climbing
$1.26 to $10.90 during regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it is concerned that America Online's deteriorating
advertising sales might crimp profit and increase the burden on the
company's Time Warner divisions to make up any shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   It said a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
accounting practices at America Online, disclosed by AOL on
Wednesday, adds to investor uncertainty and may consume significant
amounts of management time, impeding AOL's ability to improve its
operating performance.</TE>
<TE>   The shares had fallen to a near four-year low Thursday after AOL
disclosed the SEC inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   AOL stock is off 66% this year and yields on its bonds have been
pushed to junk-like levels.</TE>

<HD>MGM to Repurchase Millions of Shares</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Monica-based Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. will repurchase up to 10
million shares of its battered stock, the company said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   MGM shares have fallen 55% from their high earlier this year after
box-office disappointments such as "Rollerball" and "Windtalkers."</LD>
<LD>   The stock closed down 5 cents to $10 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Tracinda Corp., the investment company owned
by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, said it would purchase up to 10
million MGM shares. Kerkorian owns 77% of MGM.</TE>
<TE>   That announcement contradicted MGM's stated long-term goal to
reduce Kerkorian's stake, a move seen as necessary to provide broader
support for the stock and give the company currency to use for
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing its stock buyback Friday, MGM said Tracinda had
advised the company it would suspend its purchase program pending the
completion or termination of MGM's plan.</TE>

<HD>Greece Tightens Noose on Guerrillas</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Police arrest a suspected leader of a notorious
group and name a gunman in the 1975 assassination of a CIA agent in
Athens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATHENS</DL>
<LD>Greek police arrested a suspected leader of the November 17 terrorist
group Friday and identified another key figure already in custody as
a gunman in the first of its more than 20 assassinations--that of the
CIA station chief here in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Together, the steps represent a breakthrough in the effort to
crush one of the longest-lived groups to emerge from Europe's
radical-left ferment of three decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   After making no progress for 27 years, Greek police in recent
weeks have made stunning advances, arresting suspected leaders and
rank-and-file members alike. The latest is Nikos Papanastasiou, 50,
arrested Friday, who has been running a souvenir shop in central
Athens and who police believe is an important first-generation leader
of the group.</LD>
<TE>   Named after the date of a 1973 student uprising that was violently
suppressed by the military junta that then ruled Greece, November 17
burst into prominence with the killing of CIA agent Richard Welch.
Operating since then with seeming impunity, it was blamed for nearly
two dozen killings as well as many bank robberies and the theft of
weapons. It last struck in June 2000, authorities say, killing
British defense attache Brig. Stephen Saunders.</TE>
<TE>   In a predawn statement to police Friday that was quickly leaked to
the media, a suspect arrested this week, Pavlos Serifis, 46,
confessed to having been a lookout at the Welch killing and said that
co-defendant Alexandros Giotopoulos was a gunman in that killing.
Giotopoulos, 58, was the leader of the group, police said at the time
of his arrest this month.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement, Serifis also admitted being a lookout in the
1980 slayings of two Greek policemen, and he identified Giotopoulos
as a gunman in that incident as well.</TE>
<TE>   Greece's 20-year statute of limitations means that suspects cannot
be charged with murdering Welch or the other victims before 1982, but
police appear to believe that those involved in the early killings
also committed crimes in the last two decades for which they can be
prosecuted. Greece does not have the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   November 17 took pains to cultivate a kind of Robin Hood image,
releasing stridently Marxist proclamations defending its deeds as
revolutionary violence aimed at oppressors of the people. Combined
with its members' ability to avoid capture, it developed an aura of
invincibility that raised suspicions that leftist politicians were
somehow protecting the group.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, U.S. officials repeatedly complained that Greek
authorities showed insufficient determination to track down the
killers. During the group's early years, a significant portion of the
Greek public--angered by American support for the 1967-74 military
dictatorship--appeared sympathetic to November 17's ideology, if not
its methods.</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion began to swing against it in the mid-1980s when the
group targeted prominent Greek businessmen, and sympathy was further
eroded in the last two years as relatives of victims spoke out about
their suffering. With the Greek government also under pressure to
prove that it can hold a safe Olympics in Athens, the capital, in
2004, police work has been stepped up. Police also accepted help from
Britain's Scotland Yard and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, a suspected November 17 member, Savas Xiros, 40,
was arrested after he was injured, allegedly when a bomb he was
carrying went off prematurely. His capture led police to safe houses
and the arrest of more than a dozen other suspects. Most of them
talked, apparently because a new anti-terrorism law permits
authorities to be lenient with suspects who cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Those Greeks who romanticized the group have been shocked to see
that its ordinary members seem to be non-ideological criminals who
simply took orders to kill or steal, and who were held together by
family, friendship or shared guilt. Suspected members now in custody
include a hospital telephone operator, an elementary school teacher,
a painter of religious icons and a bus driver.</TE>
<TE>   Among what is being called the second-generation "operational
group" that carried out killings and robberies in the 1980s and
1990s, three suspects are brothers and several others are distantly
related. Most of the rest are friends associated with these two
family groupings. These relationships are seen as central to how the
group maintained secrecy for so long, but the ties also promoted the
chain of rapid arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Giotopoulos, a translator of French, is the only suspect arrested
so far to fit the expected profile of an aging leftist radical. He
has denied any involvement in November 17 and charged that he is
being framed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen any of my fellow accused before," Giotopoulos
said this week in a statement to an examining judge. "I believe this
is a frame-up by my fellow accused and that their depositions are the
product of a deal between them and the police in order to secure
better treatment for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Confessions by most of the suspects have been leaked by
authorities to local media, apparently with the intent of
discrediting the group and perhaps to keep up the momentum of their
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Many Greeks "expected the people arrested to come out with heroic
statements, for example, 'We delivered blows to the murderers of the
people, the Americans,' or, 'We killed businessmen who were stealing
money from the people,' " said Manolis Vasilakis, author of a book
about Greek attitudes toward terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The press had presented them as heroic and bold," and people
imagined that they "would kill a couple of policemen while police
were trying to arrest them," he said. "Instead they saw people who
are nothing but common murderers and bank robbers, [including] a
brother who would turn his brother in. There is nothing heroic about
them."</TE>
<TE>   One alleged gunman, Patroklos Tselentis, 42, was charged Friday
with taking part in five killings, including that of a defense
attache to the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Navy Capt. William Nordeen, in
June 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Many Greeks say that what has been seen so far must be an
incomplete picture of the group.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe that a case that has been in the shadows for 30
years can in 10 days be brought out into the open and solved," said
Yannis Michaloudakis, 29, a restaurant manager. "I feel that deep
down there's something [the authorities] keep as a secret and don't
want to come to the surface. I can't say what, but I feel there are
political interests behind it."</TE>
<TE>   A man interviewed on a street in Athens, who would give only his
first name, Vasilis, voiced a widely held suspicion: that Socialist
politicians with roots in the anti-junta resistance are somehow
connected to November 17.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they are trying to use those people [who have been arrested]
as the 'real leaders' and save their skin by stopping it there," he
said. "These are my feelings. I don't have the proof.... But they
cannot stop November 17 unless they stop the real leaders. If they
don't get the real leaders, it will start up all over again."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly aware of such suspicions, Public Order Minister Mikhail
Khrisokhoidis, who has led the stepped-up effort against the group,
pledged in a nationally televised speech this week that authorities
will pursue leads until all those associated with the group are
caught: "The case of November 17 and of terrorism in general in
Greece will be closed only when it is irrefutably certain that all
the culprits have been led to justice."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Squinting through the window of his 82-year-old Italian restaurant in
the historic heart of San Francisco, Paul Mechetti longingly
remembers what he no longer sees.</LD>
<LD>   "We've always had them ... lines of them out the door and down the
sidewalk, shopping bags stuffed full," says Mechetti, who has owned
the family-run Gold Spike Restaurant in North Beach for 32 years. He
squints harder, as if the tourists he speaks of will suddenly
reappear on the unusually quiet street. "There's no way it's
summertime out there. I don't know what it is."</LD>
<LD>   For a city that has had to do little more than exist to propel a
booming $8-billion tourism industry, the slowdown pressing on hotels
and businesses this summer is unfamiliar and worrisome, leaving many
wondering how much longer such a stubborn drought will last. The
economic downturn, business travel cutbacks since Sept. 11 and the
dramatic tech bust that walloped the Bay Area have all formed what
industry experts are calling "the perfect storm" for upsetting a city
that has been something of a spoiled child in the tourism industry.</LD>
<TE>   The fallout--which could cost $1.5 billion to $2 billion in
visitor spending this year compared with the peak in 2000--has left
city officials and businesses hunting for ways to attract more
regional visitors, a novel idea.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, they say, is to recast, at least temporarily, San
Francisco's sophisticated image--the average age of out-of-town
visitors is 46--as a more family-oriented destination. Carnivals and
wine tastings, concerts and international food fairs are all being
promoted in force.</TE>
<TE>   "They've never had to work hard at getting people to visit and
spend, because it all just sort of came to them," said Jeffrey
Dallas, an industry consultant for Ernst &amp; Young. "But suddenly
they're not the bargain destination people are looking for. They're
not the place to grow dot-coms anymore. They're struggling, and
they're not used to it."</TE>
<TE>   While other California tourist destinations have been showing
signs of recovery in higher hotel occupancy rates and visitor
numbers--with some, such as San Diego, already surpassing last year's
figures--San Francisco is by far rebounding the slowest. Arrivals to
San Francisco International Airport were down 17%, or about 2 million
people, for the year. Through May, hotels were slightly more than
half full, compared with nearly three-quarters occupied during the
same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, hotels are about 70% occupied, and although local
tourism officials expect fewer visitors to Southern California this
year than last, they no longer worry about the double-digit drop that
was forecast in the weeks after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "It just about drives you crazy," said John Marks, president of
the San Francisco Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. "When you're used to
being on a rocket ship, this feels like a moped."</TE>
<TE>   Marks and others in the tourism industry recall the heady times of
just two summers ago, when the city's 34,000 hotel rooms were sold
out and the yearly occupancy rate was among the highest in the
nation, second only to New York's. In 2000, convention business set a
record, international tourism was up, and the dot-com business was
robust enough to send 30-year-olds splurging on $1,500 bottles of
wine at dinner, Marks said.</TE>
<TE>   Things were so good, in fact, that Marks was often told by
colleagues in other cities that he had the easiest job in the
industry. He didn't argue.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had a good gig," Marks said. "This city has always been
on autopilot when it comes to having the best platform for visitors,
meaning equally strong business, convention and leisure travelers."</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, though, the economy began to sour, dot-coms began
to implode, and it became clear that the city's tourism industry
would suffer the most. Then came Sept. 11, and "it all went down
hard," said Dallas, the Ernst &amp; Young consultant. "And it has been on
a downward spiral since."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Tourist Markets</TE>
<TE>   To get through the slump, San Francisco is trying to lure more
regional visitors. It's a market the city long took for granted, said
Norman Williams, spokesman for the California Technology, Trade and
Commerce Agency. With 80% of the city's visitors arriving by air, San
Francisco has not had to concern itself much with attracting guests
from the 100-mile "drive-in" market.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism officials have launched promotions for restaurants, crab
fests, street festivals and weekend getaways to draw more
Californians for shorter stays. A first-ever telephone campaign
targeting residents in Sacramento and the Central Valley last fall
was duplicated in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts have paid off for some businesses, particularly those
that cater to families, such as the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf
and the newly renovated Aquarium of the Bay, where business is up 15%
and 20%, respectively. Lines for the cable cars are still the norm,
though shorter, and the daily 5,500-person boat trips to Alcatraz
from Fisherman's Wharf are selling out three days in advance,
compared with the usual week or more.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting very strong weekend traffic from families that are
driving in and staying just a night or two," said John Frawley, the
aquarium's general manager. "After putting $2 million in improvements
here, we're very relieved that we're doing so well. I know we are the
exception right now."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Westlye, manager of the Franciscan restaurant at Fisherman's
Wharf, said that although he has started to see improvement in
weekend crowds within the last two weeks, business is still down at
least 10% from a year ago and the restaurant is "still pretty empty"
on weekdays--which he attributes to a significant drop in business
travel.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after Sept. 11, Westlye said, business fell 55% and
five of his 80 employees were laid off. By November, he had
renegotiated construction loans and credit card fees to avoid more
layoffs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not seeing foreign visitors or the usual number of
Midwesterners this summer, that's for sure," Westlye said. "Everyone
we talk to is trying to minimize their budgets."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Tierney, a tourism and hospitality professor at San
Francisco State University, said that at least until business travel
fully rebounds, the city may have to do more to position itself as a
family-friendly destination.</TE>
<TE>   The city's reputation as an adult playground, with its pricey
restaurants, urbane nightlife and sexually liberal ambience, may not
be the most desirable in a climate in which families are looking to
spend less money--and more quality time together--on vacations,
Tierney said.</TE>
<TE>   "Forget about business travel meltdowns and the dot-com exodus,"
he said. "To survive right now, you have to be affordable and you
have to have a family market. San Francisco is becoming a little more
affordable--but only out of desperation. So now it has to highlight
its family attractions too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Family Affordability</TE>
<TE>   Drew and Janise Singleton of San Diego said it had been nearly 10
years since their last visit to the Bay Area, largely because they
had always considered a San Francisco vacation unaffordable for a
family of four.</TE>
<TE>   "We can do so many other things where we live for so much
cheaper," said Drew Singleton, 40, as his wife and sons munched
Ghirardelli chocolate crepes at Pier 39 last week. "This always
seemed like an expensive trip to us, almost a splurge that we
couldn't justify."</TE>
<TE>   But when Janise found rooms at the upscale Argent Hotel near Union
Square for $99 a night and air fare for less than $100 a person on
the Internet last month, the family decided to take a long weekend
and go for it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been wonderful," she said. "A little colder than we
expected, but the [smaller] crowds are nice and the city is as
beautiful as we remember."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many hotels and merchants say the absence of business
travelers has hurt even more than the slowdown in tourism because
corporate visitors tend to spend more on rooms and meals.</TE>
<TE>   Tom LaTour, chief executive of the Kimpton Group, which operates
16 mid-range, boutique hotels in San Francisco, said the
much-anticipated upswing in travel hasn't materialized since Sept.
11, and the pace of improvement is painfully slow. Even convention
traffic--which typically pays the second highest after business
travel--has been bringing in fewer attendees per event. In years
past, there would have been an overflow of delegates clamoring for
hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, LaTour said, his properties have just started to bump
into the 70% occupancy rate, with average room rates down 15% from
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hardly healthy," he said. "And I'm surprised, frankly, that
I'm still saying that."</TE>
<TE>   In the popular North Beach neighborhood, where restaurant and
retail owners are having the worst summer in memory, a few merchants
have tried to boost business with mini-attractions of their own, said
Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Marsha Garland. The district
has seen 10 shops close in a three-block radius since January, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Business is down 30% or more for North Beach, and there's nothing
I can do to make it better," Garland said. "It's unheard of. You used
to barely be able to walk down the sidewalks around here. Now you can
find parking."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Azzollini, who owns the Caffe Roma coffee shop on Columbus
Avenue, recently introduced a casual evening wine bar, complete with
lighthearted Italian lessons for the whole family, that has helped
keep business somewhat on par with last summer. He also makes a
weekly production out of roasting coffee beans in the front window of
his store, after 14 years of quietly getting the job done in the back
room.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're doing OK, but only because we've worked very, very
hard at staying afloat," Azzollini said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tourists are our gravy, but we can't just wait around for them to
come back. We have to grab what we can get."</TE>
<TE>   As always, crowds are still the largest at Fisherman's Wharf,
where every other store sells tourist garb, street performers hope
for handouts and artists sketch children's faces for $2 apiece--a
price, they will quickly say, that has been cut in half from last
year. But even managers at the busiest shops say few sales are being
made.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Wong, who runs a shop packed floor to ceiling with shirts
and sweaters on Taylor Street in the wharf, said he finds himself
"sitting down on the job" more than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no customers to help," Wong said, perched on a stool by
the cash register. "A few people will come in, look a little and
leave. They don't buy. So here I sit. Let me know when it's time to
get up."</TE>

<DL>PRINCETON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>From its towering trees to its Gothic arches, the normally tranquil
campus of Princeton University was abuzz Friday with one question:
Why?</LD>
<LD>   Why would an admissions officer at the august institution hack
into a Yale University Web site designed to tell high school students
whether they had been admitted to the campus in New Haven, Conn?</LD>
<LD>   Sophomore Chris Greenman, heading up a leafy pathway on his way to
Firestone Library, rolled his eyes when asked about the electronic
break-in.</LD>
<TE>   "The first thing I thought was, there goes our No. 1 rating," said
Greenman, referring to Princeton's ranking in an annual survey of
U.S. campuses. "But seriously, this is a pretty terrible thing to do.
It's potentially criminal. And the guy who did it should be fired.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't uphold high standards at a place like Princeton and do
this. I only wonder what his motivation could have been."</TE>
<TE>   As the FBI launched an investigation that could cost Princeton a
chunk of federal funds, that same question ricocheted across the Ivy
League. Ethics scandals have rocked the worlds of business, religion
and politics in recent months, but with its lofty insistence of
intellectual integrity, the ivory tower seemed somehow immune.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Princeton University Admissions Director Stephen E.
LeMenager admitted he repeatedly broke into a Web site for Yale
applicants. Many marveled at why one elite school would resort to
Internet chicanery to snoop on another.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the technological trespassing was an indication of
just how cutthroat competition in the Ivy League has become.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of thing I would expect from a corporation
nowadays--you know, a real disregard for ethics," said John Rogers,
touring the campus here Friday from the Midwest with his two
daughters. "It's not what I would expect from a great university."</TE>
<TE>   LeMenager, immediately placed on paid academic leave, did not
respond Friday to interview requests. University spokeswoman Marilyn
Marks reiterated an acknowledgment of "a serious lapse of judgment by
at least one member of our admissions staff," and she announced that
a lawyer hired by Princeton arrived on campus Friday to conduct an
independent inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Marks said she did not know what amount of federal funds could be
at risk because the improper entry of the Yale Web site involved the
use of students' Social Security numbers, a possible violation of the
Family Educational Rights Privacy Act.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very sad day for Princeton," said a history
professor--every inch the academic in his bow tie, seersucker suit
and dapper straw hat--who was too upset to give his name. "Whatever
happened to standards and honesty?"</TE>
<TE>   According to one report, LeMenager--an admissions officer at
Princeton since 1983--said he was exploring the idea of setting up a
Web site similar to the site designed by a Yale senior to enable
applicants to learn their admission status. But Chris Michel, a
senior who is editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said
LeMenager's contention that he wanted only to find out how vulnerable
the site really was sounded flimsy.</TE>
<TE>   "If Princeton was that concerned about the security, they could
have sent their [information technology] people to talk to us," said
Michel, who spent Friday fending off e-mails from around the country
after his publication broke the story Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The incident included 18 improper visits to the Web site and
involved 11 students who apparently applied to both Princeton and
Yale. Michel said that along with ethics implications, the episode
carried a heavy "psychological impact."</TE>
<TE>   Ivy League schools compete fiercely for a narrow fraction of
superstar students. The application process is grueling and, as
Michel pointed out, "This certainly doesn't make it any easier."</TE>
<TE>   Schools of the caliber of Princeton and Yale "talk about trust a
lot, and they talk about integrity," Michel said. "The sense that
pervades these campuses is that these are students who are not only
academically talented but are being trained to be the leaders of
tomorrow. If we are giving them this kind of message at this stage of
the application, then it is very troubling."</TE>
<TE>   At his office outside Boston, college planning consultant Lloyd
Peterson said Friday that he was mystified why Princeton would find
it necessary to troll for information about students already accepted
to Yale.</TE>
<TE>   "The intellectual firepower is about the same in both places,"
said Peterson, a former associate director of admissions at Yale who
now advises high school students. "Everybody's competing with
everybody now, but has it reached the point where poor Princeton is
poaching on Yale? Everybody's got enough A-average, 1,600-SAT score
kids in the pool to where this isn't necessary. I guess a certain
paranoia just slipped into the Princeton folks."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said he was disturbed because "in the [Ivy] league, we
always felt whether a student or an employee, you set the tone. You
set the standard with regard to integrity and fair play and
practice."</TE>
<TE>   He described LeMenager as "a great guy. He's clean cut and
easy-going, kind of reminds me of Opie Taylor from ["The Andy
Griffith Show."]. He's just a good guy, and what compelled this kind
of activity? There's got to be a legitimate explanation, and for the
life of me, I can't find it."</TE>
<TE>   Former Dartmouth College President James O. Freedman said Friday
that he also was puzzled by Princeton's high-tech raid on Yale.
Top-echelon college applicants all are overachievers, he said, with
dazzling records of grades, test scores and extracurricular
activities.</TE>
<TE>   These students are such strong candidates for admission that a
school could basically take the first 1,000 applications that come in
over the transom and have a fine freshman class, Freedman suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so much alike that the first 250 kids on the waiting
list are just as good as the last 250 who were admitted," he said.
"This isn't like athletics, where getting the quarterback makes the
difference. If you don't get one kid, you're going to get another who
is virtually identical."</TE>
<TE>   With such a similar pool of applicants, the mystery here was the
motivation, Freedman said. "Intramural competition" among admissions
directors might be one explanation, he said. But to take it to this
extreme?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we do have higher expectations for academe," he said. "I
think we ought to have higher expectations. Academe does say by
design that we are a half step above the fray--and we ought to remain
there. This, therefore, comes as a very great surprise. I am shocked
that this would happen."</TE>
<TE>   But as he strolled across a campus founded in 1746, John Rogers
said the controversy would not dampen his desire to see his two
daughters among the 4,500 undergraduates at Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "Not at all," he said. "I'd do anything to get my daughters into
this school."</TE>

<HD>Democrats' Hopes Rest on Dixie</HD>
<DH>Politics: The party has a rare opportunity to gain ground
in the South, where four incumbent Republican senators are retiring
after this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BURLINGTON, N.C.</DL>
<LD>On a sweltering summer morning, Erskine Bowles is crisp and collected
as he greets supporters at breakfast here and smoothly fields
questions on issues from Iraq to health care.</LD>
<LD>   Over eggs and grits, Bowles, the front-runner for the Democratic
Senate nomination in North Carolina, hammers at the bread-and-butter
messages his party is stressing across the country this year. He
pledges to create a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, put
more money into education and resist Republican plans to partially
privatize Social Security.</LD>
<LD>   But Bowles, a businessman and former White House chief of staff
for President Clinton, also stresses his North Carolina roots. That's
a none-too-subtle dig at the anticipated Republican nominee: former
GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who has lived most
of her adult life outside the state.</LD>
<TE>   North Carolina is one of four Southern states that will choose new
senators this fall to replace retiring Republican incumbents. The
Democratic contenders, like Bowles, are stressing lunch-bucket
economics and clawing for any local advantage in a quartet of races
that have emerged as pivotal battlegrounds.</TE>
<TE>   In a region that reveres incumbency, this unusual confluence of
open seats represents a critical opportunity for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   With both parties on track to field strong candidates in all the
races, the contests will provide a revealing measure of the new
partisan balance in Dixie--and test the extent of the mini-revival
that Democrats have enjoyed across the region since the low point of
the mid-1990s. Also, with several Democratic incumbents in the
Midwest facing tough races, some analysts believe the party may be
unable to retain its slim control of the Senate unless it captures at
least one of the South's four open seats.</TE>
<TE>   These elections will replace some of the biggest names in the
Senate: conservative icons Jesse Helms in North Carolina, Strom
Thurmond in South Carolina and Phil Gramm in Texas, as well as Fred
Thompson, a telegenic moderate from Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Several of those vying for the openings--such as charismatic
Republican Rep. Lindsey O. Graham in South Carolina and Ron Kirk, an
African American Democrat and former Dallas mayor, in Texas--could
quickly become national stars if they win. The White House recognizes
the stakes in the contests: President Bush already has headlined
fund-raisers for Graham and John Cornyn, the GOP nominee and attorney
general in Texas, and Thursday he campaigned with Dole in North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The early line among political analysts gives Republicans a slight
chance of holding all four seats. But none is a sure thing for the
GOP. Both sides consider Democrats within reach in each race; in
Texas, Kirk has led Cornyn in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of these open-seat races are going to be
competitive," said Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice
University in Houston and co-author of the book "The Rise of Southern
Republicans." "I would give Republicans a modest edge in all four,
but nothing that amounts to any kind of certainty."</TE>
<TE>   Even those odds represent an improvement for Democrats in the
South.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, Democrats steadily lost ground in the region as
white Southerners who began voting Republican for president in the
1960s increasingly backed GOP candidates in Senate and House
elections. During Clinton's often chaotic first term, the number of
Southern Democrats in Congress fell to its lowest point since the
Reconstruction period following the Civil War. By 1996, Southern
Republicans controlled 71 of the 125 House seats and 15 of the 22
Senate seats in the 11 states of the old Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Bush underscored the continuing Republican strength in
the region by winning all 11 of these states. But local Democratic
candidates had stopped their retreat and even begun to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, Southern Democrats have essentially held even in the
House, reduced the GOP margin by two seats in the Senate and made an
unexpected breakthrough in governor's races. Democrats now control
the governorship in six of the 11 states.</TE>
<TE>   National and local factors contributed to the modest improvement.
Democrats have improved the turnout of African Americans and made
some inroads among Southern white suburbanites, largely through their
support for public education. They also benefited from Clinton's
greater success, beginning late in his first term, at moving his
party toward the center on issues such as the federal budget deficit
and welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a much better situation to run as a Democrat in the South,"
said Democratic strategist Tad Devine. "Mere association with the
Democrats isn't disqualifying, which for a time it might have been."</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the South's four closely watched Senate races this year,
it's the GOP candidates who are most eager to associate with their
national party. Across the board, the Republicans are linking
themselves to Bush, not only on the war against terrorism but also by
pledging to defend his tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   "The overarching issue will be support for George Bush and George
Bush's agenda," says GOP pollster Whit Ayres, who is working in the
Tennessee and South Carolina races.</TE>
<TE>   That message is already rippling through the campaigns. In
Tennessee, former governor and two-time presidential hopeful Lamar
Alexander and conservative Rep. Ed Bryant are competing for the GOP
Senate nomination in a primary Thursday. One of their key arguments:
who would support Bush more.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Graham, the GOP nominee to succeed Thurmond in South
Carolina, built his first advertisement around an endorsement from
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, Cornyn is working to portray Kirk as an impediment to
Bush's agenda--an argument the president himself made in an interview
with a Texas television station.</TE>
<TE>   "We will show that even a well-meaning Democratic senator is going
to Washington to empower" liberals such as Sens. Hillary Rodham
Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), said David
Beckwith, Cornyn's communication director.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Democrats are emphasizing their independence.
Bowles tells his audiences to vote for someone else "if you are
looking for someone who is just going to go to Washington and vote
the straight party line."</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, Kirk is presenting himself as a problem solver who can
reach across party lines; he has called on the Democratic Senate to
move faster in confirming Bush's judicial appointments and generally
blurred issue differences with Cornyn.</TE>
<TE>   In South Carolina, folksy Democratic nominee Alex Sanders is
stressing his experience as a state legislator, judge and college
president.</TE>
<TE>   "Graham is going to try to make this ideological and partisan, and
Sanders is going to say, 'No, this is about who is qualified,' " said
Bill Carrick, a consultant for Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Democratic candidates also are embracing two national
party priorities: blocking partial privatization of Social Security
and backing a prescription drug benefit under Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   In Tennessee, the Democratic nominee, Rep. Bob Clement, is banging
at both those issues. So is Bowles as he campaigns to win the Senate
nomination in North Carolina in a Sept. 10 primary. "Social Security
is supposed to be a guarantee, not a gamble," Bowles said at the
recent breakfast gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Most North Carolina Democrats consider Bowles the party's
strongest possible nominee against Dole. But he has some unusual
challenges. One is his link to Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   When Bowles spoke at a business luncheon in Burlington, one man
asked his tablemates: "As Clinton's chief of staff, do you think he
ever found out what the definition of 'is' is?"</TE>
<TE>   And amid rising concern about corporate responsibility, Bowles
faces criticism over his role as a partner in the Wall Street
investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co. and a board member for the
drug maker Merck &amp; Co. Firing back, Bowles said his business
background "was an asset to me at the White House ... and will be an
asset to me in the U.S. Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Adding urgency to the four Democratic campaigns is an awareness
that the races for open seats present an opportunity unlikely to
recur anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1992, Democrats have defeated only one of 15 Southern GOP
senators who sought reelection, Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina. He
lost in 1998 to Democrat John Edwards, now a possible contender for
his party's 2004 presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   The South has a tradition of venerating experience and incumbency.</TE>
<TE>   The four Republican senators retiring this year have held their
seats for more than a combined 100 years, with Thurmond and Helms
alone accumulating 76.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that if Democrats can't take some of these seats now,
they may have to wait quite a while for as good a chance.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl Everett became the first Texas player to homer twice in an
inning, doing it in a nine-run seventh inning, as the Rangers rallied
to defeat the Oakland Athletics, 12-4, Friday night at Arlington,
Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Ruben Rivera hit a tiebreaking homer in the seventh, Juan Gonzalez
drove in three runs and Rafael Palmeiro hit a two-run homer, ending a
streak of 17 consecutive solo homers.</LD>
<LD>   Palmeiro's 474th career homer left him one behind Stan Musial and
Willie Stargell for 20th place all-time.</LD>
<TE>   Trailing 4-3, the Rangers scored nine runs in the seventh in their
biggest inning of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Everett and Rivera homered off Oakland starter Mark Mulder (11-6)
to give the Rangers a 5-4 lead. After the Rangers loaded the bases,
Gonzalez hit a two-run single to score Michael Young and Kevin Mench.</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro followed with an RBI single and Ivan Rodriguez hit a
two-run double to make it 10-4. Everett capped the inning with a
two-run blast for his eighth homer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada went three for four and tied his career-best hitting
streak of 15 games with a single in the first inning for Oakland. The
A's struggled to capitalize on scoring opportunities, hitting into
five double plays as they lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durham went one for four with an RBI in his first game for
Oakland since being acquired from the Chicago White Sox in a trade
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger reliever Rich Rodriguez (1-1) got two outs for the victory.
Texas starter Rob Bell gave up four runs and nine hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder gave up five runs and six hits in six innings, losing only
his third start in his last 12 outings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 9, Boston 2--Rodrigo Lopez pitched eight strong innings
for his 11th victory, the most by an Oriole rookie since 1989,
leading Baltimore at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Melvin Mora and Howie Clark had consecutive RBI doubles in
Baltimore's five-run third inning. Tony Batista had a solo homer for
the Orioles, who ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez (11-3), who won his fifth consecutive decision, gave up two
runs and four hits, walking one and striking out eight.</TE>
<TE>   New York 12, Tampa Bay 9--Raul Mondesi homered and drove in four
runs and Robin Ventura hit a two-run homer as the Yankees won at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi had a two-run double during a four-run fourth, was hit by
a pitch with the bases loaded in the sixth and hit a solo homer in
the ninth. Ventura hit his 20th homer in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 8, Cleveland 5--Bobby Higginson, Randall Simon and Robert
Fick each had four hits and two RBIs to lead the Tigers at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome hit two homers for Cleveland in his return after missing
six games with a stiff back. He hit his 29th in the sixth to bring
the Indians within 7-4, and blasted a 470-foot shot to right in the
eighth to make it 8-5.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 10, Toronto 5--Jacque Jones hit two home runs, including
a tiebreaking two-run shot in the sixth inning as the Twins won at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Doug Mientkiewicz each drove in three runs for the
Twins, who had 16 hits. All nine Minnesota starters had at least one
hit, led by A.J. Pierzynski's three singles.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Kansas City 2--Highly touted Willie Harris, now
getting a full-time chance in the majors after the White Sox traded
Durham, hit his first big league home run as the White Sox won at
Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Yes, They Are: Angels in First</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Lackey pitches them to 8-0 win in Seattle,
leaving teams tied atop AL West and completing Anaheim's recovery
from worst start in club history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Yes, they can.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels completed a dizzying and magical ascent Friday, shoving
the Seattle Mariners aside and seizing a share of first place from
the defending division champions. In their first visit here since the
Mariners seemingly left them for dead three months ago, the Angels
made up the last of the 10 1/2 games that then separated the teams in
the American League West.</LD>
<LD>   Even the "Yes We Can" Angels of 1979--the first division champions
in club history--would not have found victory this improbable, or
this sweet: The Angels moved into a tie for first place behind John
Lackey, a rookie who was supposed to spend the summer in triple-A,
and Scott Spiezio, who was not supposed to hit well enough to play
first base for a contending team.</LD>
<TE>   But Lackey pitched eight shutout innings and Spiezio drove in
three runs as the Angels pounded the Mariners, 8-0. Shawn Wooten
drove in a run by drawing his first walk of the year with the bases
loaded, and Tim Salmon homered and doubled as the first-place Angels
silenced a sellout crowd of 45,559 at Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Long time coming," Salmon said. "It's nice to finally feel caught
up, but here's where the work starts."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since April 11, the Mariners do not have sole
possession of first place. The Angels had not occupied first place,
shared or alone, this season. They have not occupied first place this
late in a season since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a much nicer spot to be in," Spiezio said. "It feels good. I
don't think we feel we're where we need to be, but we feel as if
we're going in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Mike Scioscia: "We understand the challenge. We're
not raising any pennants now."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they can? Why not? In addition to tying the Mariners for
first place, they jumped three games ahead of the Oakland Athletics
in the AL West and two ahead of the Boston Red Sox in the wild-card
race.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels appear to have found the antidote to the Mariners'
"Sodo Mojo," and whatever other spells Seattle might have cast over
them. The Mariners won 15 of 19 games from the Angels last season and
the first six games between the teams this season. But the Angels and
Mariners have played four times in the past eight days; the Angels
have won all four and outscored Seattle, 36-14.</TE>
<TE>   In his sixth career start, Lackey scattered six hits, all singles.
He made 114 pitches, with Al Levine working the ninth inning to
complete the shutout.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels weren't surprised that Lackey, who made his first major
league start in front of a hometown crowd in Texas and his second
start before a sellout crowd against the Dodgers, did not wither
under pressure. They were pleased that Spiezio robbed the Mariners of
two hits with fine defensive plays, that second baseman Adam Kennedy
stole another hit with a leaping catch and left fielder Garret
Anderson erased yet another with a nice running catch.</TE>
<TE>   But they were thrilled that Lackey pitched with such effectiveness
that the Mariners did not get a man into scoring position for the
first six innings, and with such poise that he pitched out of a
bases-loaded, one-out mess in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty cool," he said. "I want to make the most of this
opportunity so I can hang around here."</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels were last in Seattle, they were 6-14, the worst
start in franchise history. Now they're on pace to finish with the
best winning percentage in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it feels like a different season," Scioscia said,
"but we absolutely feel like a different team."</TE>
<TE>   And how about first place? Big series, you know.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's too early to pin 'pivotal series' or 'must-win' or
'sending messages' on these games," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   So when do the games become pivotal?</TE>
<TE>   "When you start counting magic numbers and games behind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Angels' number in the "games behind" column is zero. A
magic number indeed.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Need for Relief Is in Outfield</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>If the Angels acquire one player by Wednesday's trading deadline, he
might be an outfielder rather than a relief pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   While the Angels remain interested in adding a hard-throwing
veteran reliever to help set up closer Troy Percival, concerns about
organizational depth have prompted them to add outfield help to their
shopping list.</LD>
<LD>   The current roster includes one reserve outfielder, Orlando
Palmeiro. Two other potential reserve outfielders, Jeff DaVanon and
Julio Ramirez, are out indefinitely because of injury, so an injury
to one of the starting outfielders could be devastating.</LD>
<TE>   Palmeiro bats left-handed, so a right-handed hitter who could add
pop to the bench, and start if necessary, would be ideal. Infielder
Jose Nieves, who has looked shaky in outfield trials and has started
one game since Shawn Wooten returned 16 days ago, could be
expendable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's game, the Angels activated Percival from the
disabled list and optioned reliever Lou Pote to triple-A Salt Lake,
where they want him to work as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Pote said the Angels had refused his request to be removed from
the 40-man roster, which would have allowed another team to claim him
on waivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a future here," he said. "If I had a future here, I
wouldn't be going down."</TE>
<TE>   Pote had a 3.23 earned-run average, but he had given up seven runs
in his last seven innings and had appeared four times in the last 23
games. The Angels were more impressed with Brendan Donnelly and Scot
Shields in relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a surprise. I didn't pitch, ever," he said. "I'm just
an insurance policy."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' bullpen shined in Percival's absence. The Angels went
8-3 with Percival on the disabled list, with Ben Weber converting all
four of his save opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' medical director, said catcher Bengie
Molina could be activated Thursday, after a minimum 15-day stay on
the disabled list for a hamstring injury that was originally expected
to sideline him for at least one month. Molina has responded
exceptionally well to treatment, Yocum said, and has been running,
catching and hitting. The Angels won't count on Molina to return this
week until they see how responds to more vigorous workouts, but the
possibility he could return so soon is thrilling news to Manager Mike
Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "If you would have asked me that three days ago, I would have said
you were crazy," he said.</TE>

the Storm. Tampa Bay is 33-0 all-time when scoring 60 or more points.
Despite its losing record, Tampa Bay won its last two games and the
Avengers lost two of their last three. Avenger offensive specialist
Chris Jackson, who might have rewritten the record book for receivers
if he hadn't been sidelined for five games because of injuries, did
not play in the May 17 game between the teams. A big day by Jackson
spells big trouble for the Storm.</TE>

<LD>First-round playoff games can be fraught with intrigue. And the
Avenger-Tampa Bay Storm contest, one of four Arena Football League
wild-card games this weekend, is no exception.</LD>
<LD>   The Avengers, in their third season, are in the Arena playoffs for
the first time. Their 8-6 record and third-place finish in the
Western Division under first-year Coach Ed Hodgkiss earned them the
fifth seeding.</LD>
<LD>   Though the franchise is young, several Avengers, among them
running back Chad Dukes, have extensive postseason experience.</LD>
<TE>   "[Today] is a huge game not only for the organization, but the
morale of the team in the future," said Dukes, a four-year Arena
veteran. "I remember my first playoff game [in 1996], and I felt I
was still trying to catch up to where the rest of the team was. So I
busted my butt on every play. That's what I hope to relate to the
newer guys."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay stumbled to a 6-8 record and sneaked into the playoffs
seeded 12th and last. But the Storm is appearing in its 12th
consecutive postseason, an Arena record.</TE>
<TE>   When the teams met May 17, the Avengers won, 38-24, holding the
Storm to its lowest point total of the year. It was also an Avenger
record for the fewest points scored by an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   But the Storm was staggering through a series of key injuries, the
most crucial being starting quarterback John Kaleo, who was lost for
the season after hurting his knee. Shane Stafford eventually settled
in as Kaleo's replacement and threw for 2,164 yards and 39 touchdowns
with seven interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm must slow an Avenger offense that has several standouts.
Dukes led the league in rushing with 223 yards and scored 12
touchdowns. Quarterback Tony Graziani was the league's third-best
passer, throwing for 3,568 yards and 67 touchdowns against nine
interceptions. Greg Hopkins and Chris Jackson finished as the top
receiving tandem in league history, combining for 187 receptions,
2,490 yards, 57 touchdowns and totaling an Arena-record 384 points.</TE>

<HD>Yankee Closer Rivera Goes on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees put closer Mariano Rivera on the 15-day disabled
list because of a strained right shoulder Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The move came two days after Rivera experienced continued
tightness in his shoulder after playing catch in the Yankees' bullpen
before Wednesday's game at Cleveland. Rivera is eligible to come off
the DL on Aug. 5. The Yankees recalled left-hander Randy Choate from
triple-A Columbus.</LD>
<LD>   With Rivera out, Torre is using Steve Karsay and Mike Stanton in
closing situations.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera, who received a cortisone shot Thursday, is 1-4 with a 3.06
earned run average and 24 saves in 28 chances this season. Rivera was
on the disabled list from June 10-25 with a strained right groin. It
was only his second trip to the DL, with the other coming in 1998
when he also had a groin strain.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees will decide, after a rehabilitation start tonight, if
pitcher Roger Clemens will be ready to return from a strained groin
by next week. Clemens is scheduled to throw 80-90 pitches for Class-A
Tampa. It will be his first game action since going on the disabled
list July 13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a brief discussion of revenue sharing, baseball's labor
talks in New York broke until next week.</TE>
<TE>   The sides met for five hours Thursday and management negotiators
expressed optimism, but Friday's session lasted for only an hour. The
sides say they are available for meetings every day next week, when
union head Donald Fehr hopes to conclude much of his tour of the 30
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Players, fearful that owners will change work rules or lock them
out following the postseason, are threatening to call the sport's
ninth work stoppage since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   If players don't see progress in the talks, their executive board
is likely to set a strike date for August or September. Because there
are five games scheduled that day, Aug. 12 has been mentioned as a
possible date for the executive board to hold either its next meeting
or a telephone conference call.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Blue Jay catcher Darrin Fletcher, who played 14 seasons in
the major leagues, abruptly announced his retirement. Fletcher, 35,
notified General Manager J.P. Ricciardi of his decision by phone.
Fletcher was not with the team in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher was hitting .220 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 45
games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher broke into the majors with the Dodgers in 1989 and had
his most productive season in 2000, when he hit .320 with 20 home
runs in 122 games with the Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays recalled outfielder Pedro Swann from triple-A
Syracuse to fill Fletcher's spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Brewers fined reliever Mike DeJean and the
right-hander apologized to his teammates and fans for his screaming
match on the mound with Manager Jerry Royster on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   DeJean initially apologized after the blowup on Wednesday night,
and repeated it an interview before Friday's game against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened. I can't change it," DeJean said. "All I can do is
apologize for it and try to prove to everybody that I'm not the
raving lunatic that I looked like the other night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox activated infielder Carlos Baerga from the
15-day disabled list and designated right-hander Rich Garces for
assignment.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one match, you have an aging former heavyweight champion back in
the ring to face one of the most colorful and unique fighters in the
sport. In the other, you have a heavyweight champion who can walk
down the street largely unnoticed against a challenger the casual fan
has never heard of.</LD>
<LD>   Which is the more appealing match?</LD>
<LD>   Sad to say, it's the first. Sad because it illustrates how far the
heavyweight division, once the most glamorous in boxing, has fallen.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight at the Scope arena in Norfolk, Va., Larry Holmes, truly an
aging former champion at 52, will take on Eric Esch, better known as
Butterbean, in a 10-round main event.</TE>
<TE>   Also tonight at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center, World
Boxing Assn. heavyweight champion John Ruiz will face Kirk Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the shrill histrionics of Ruiz's promoter, Don King,
Holmes and Butterbean will draw more attention.</TE>
<TE>   Old Man and the Bean</TE>
<TE>   Holmes, who once boasted that Rocky Marciano couldn't carry his
jockstrap, will now further deflate his image by taking on a former
tough-man star who is as much a circus act as a fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes has a legacy to be proud of. If he hadn't been in the
unfortunate position of following Muhammad Ali as heavyweight
champion, Holmes would be better remembered as one of the best in
heavyweight history. Possessor of a tremendous jab and excellent
power, he won his first 48 professional fights, one short of
Marciano's record, and was heavyweight king from 1978-1985, defending
the title 19 times.</TE>
<TE>   But like all too many fighters, Holmes found retirement
unacceptable, returning again and again to the ring, holding out hope
he'd eventually escape from Ali's shadow. Instead, he has cast a
shadow over his own accomplishments for a new generation of fans.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting Butterbean--whose assortment of opponents has included a
truck driver, a sawmill worker, a bartender and, yes, even an
occasional professional fighter--is hardly going to enhance the
reputation of Holmes (68-6, 44 knockouts), whose last fight, two
years ago, should have been his last fight.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting is something I've done all my life," Holmes said. "In
spite of my age and what people may say, wish, hope or pray for, I'm
still good at what I do and I don't mind bragging about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things are worth coming out of retirement for. This is to
eliminate some of the gaudiness and honky-tonk from the sport."</TE>
<TE>   Encouraging Butterbean will eliminate the honky-tonk?</TE>
<TE>   Butterbean (63-1, 47) figures he's just getting started. By moving
beyond the usual four-round fights--he was once dubbed king of the
four-rounders and given a bogus belt along with the bogus title--and
taking on Holmes, Butterbean hopes to finally lure his ultimate
opponent into the ring: Mike Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Considering his last performance against Lennox Lewis and his
dismal prospects for the future, Tyson might finally be reduced to
fighting Butterbean.</TE>
<TE>   And Butterbean might actually have a chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   How sad is that for the state of the heavyweight division?</TE>
<TE>   Fight for Recognition</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz (37-4-1, 27) emerged from his three grueling matches against
Evander Holyfield as the WBA champion, but the credibility Ruiz has
long sought did not come with victory.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz holds the distinction of being the first Latino heavyweight
king, but his title has been tainted by the fact he beat a washed-up
Holyfield and that Lewis is regarded as the undisputed champion
everywhere but the WBA.</TE>
<TE>   "John Ruiz was knocked out in 19 seconds [by David Tua in 1996],"
said King, "and he can't seem to get past that. He doesn't get the
recognition, and I just can't understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ruiz: "I don't know what I have to do, fight Holyfield a
fourth time?"</TE>
<TE>   No, no, anything but that. The first three holding, head-butting
marathons failed to produce a single memorable moment.</TE>
<TE>   In Johnson, Ruiz will be facing an unbeaten fighter at 32-0-1 with
23 knockouts. But to truly gain acclaim, Ruiz would have to beat
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Black and White Fight</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz thinks his title isn't appreciated?</TE>
<TE>   Clifford "The Black Rhino" Etienne (24-1, 17) is the International
Boxing Assn. Continental Americas heavyweight king. How obscure is
that?</TE>
<TE>   He'll put that dubious title on the line tonight at the New
Orleans Arena against veteran Francois "White Buffalo" Botha (44-4-1,
one no-contest, 28 knockouts).</TE>
<TE>   Running Feud</TE>
<TE>   Not scheduled to meet until their Sept. 14 showdown at Mandalay
Bay, Oscar De La Hoya and Fernando Vargas ran into each other earlier
this week while doing dawn road work in Big Bear, where both are
training.</TE>
<TE>   The two fighters were bolstered by their entourages, who did most
of the talking and the finger pointing.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll have to get up earlier than this to beat me," yelled
Vargas.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya noted Vargas was wearing a rubber suit, presumably to
work off excess weight. Vargas says he is right on schedule to come
in at 154 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Save it for September, guys.</TE>

<LD>The Northern Arizona athletic department is sending out 50,000
brochures urging people to attend the Aug. 31 game against Arizona.
What's unusual about that?</LD>
<LD>   The game is not at Flagstaff, but in Arizona Stadium at Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a great opportunity to play against Arizona," said Northern
Arizona Athletic Director Steve Holton. "It's a chance to rally
50,000 alums in the state of Arizona and get them involved with a
high-profile event. We wanted to make sure our fans were aware of the
unique chance to see the two schools compete on the football field."</LD>
<TE>   It will be the first meeting of the two Arizona schools in 57
years.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who has the longest Formula One winning streak?</TE>
<TE>   Be patient: Why are so many golf writers muttering about what is
wrong with Phil Mickelson because he has won 21 PGA tournaments
without winning a major?</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hogan had 29 tournament titles before winning his first major
and Sam Snead had 27 before his first. Not bad company.</TE>
<TE>   Making a choice: Arthur Blank, new owner of the Atlanta Falcons,
polled his fans on what they would like as entertainment during or
after Falcon games. The breakdown:</TE>
<TE>   James Brown 42%</TE>
<TE>   Temptations 10%</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Symphony Orchestra 5%</TE>
<TE>   None. Shut up and play football 43%</TE>
<TE>   No fooling: The Atlanta Braves held a "Wanna Play Hooky From Work"
day for an afternoon game with the Florida Marlins. Fans were given
fake glasses, each with a nose and mustache, to serve as a disguise
at the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Marlins fans were not impressed, because that's what they wear
anyway," noted Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   Cows and cars: Stock car racing legend Richard Petty, on how he
got started in racing: "My father was in the racing business instead
of being a farmer. When I grew up, we used to go to school and play
football, baseball and basketball, and all the boys, when they'd get
through, they'd go home--most of them was country boys, and they'd
plow fields and milk cows. I went home and worked on race cars."</TE>
<TE>   Vote of confidence: San Jose Mercury News columnist Mark Purdy,
evaluating past Golden State Warrior coaches, said of Brian Winters,
"The coaching equivalent of Spam. He took up space for no apparent
reason."</TE>
<TE>   Small favors: After a giant pine tree fronting the 18th green at
Pebble Beach had to be cut down because of disease, the course owners
decided to replace it with a similar tree from the first hole. It
took more than 80 people to move the 70-foot-tall Monterey cypress to
its new location at a cost of nearly $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   But, as SCGA official Bob Thomas noted, "At least they didn't have
to pay for the tree."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Alberto Ascari, who won seven consecutive Grand
Prix races in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Now that The Times has a daily soccer column, how
about some cricket news: England captain Nasser Hussain was unbeaten
on 120 to help his team to a 257-4 lead over India on day one of the
first Test at Lord's in London. Hussain faced 262 deliveries and
struck 20 fours.</TE>
<TE>   For the uninitiated, "deliveries" are like pitches and "fours" are
like home runs.</TE>

<HD>Houston Has No Problem</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Newly acquired infielder gets four hits, igniting
Beltre and offense in 11-6 win over Giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers will receive a player to be named later in the trade that
brought utility player Tyler Houston from the Milwaukee Brewers on
Tuesday. As an added bonus, they got a player to be named sooner, a
guy by the name of Adrian Beltre.</LD>
<LD>   Houston made his Dodger debut at first base Friday night, and the
pilot light under the underachieving Beltre turned into a raging
flame.</LD>
<LD>   Houston, who is expected to take playing time away from Beltre at
third base, got hits in his first three at-bats, and Beltre followed
each with a big hit of his own, leading the Dodgers to an 11-6
pounding of the San Francisco Giants before 41,675 in Pac Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Houston finished with four hits, including a two-run triple in the
first inning, and four runs batted in, and Beltre had four hits,
including a three-run triple in the second, and four RBIs to lift the
Dodgers out of their offensive morass for at least one night.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek added four hits, all singles, and two RBIs, as
the Dodgers amassed 18 hits, one shy of their season high, and scored
their most runs since an 11-5 win over Colorado on June 3.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers moved into sole possession of second place in the
National League West but remain four games behind first-place
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a lot of fun," Houston said. "It was fun enough being
part of the Dodgers, but it was nice to be part of a great rivalry,
to be yelled at and told I stink."</TE>
<TE>   Houston's boost was exactly what the Dodgers envisioned when they
acquired him for two minor league pitchers. They needed a left-handed
batter to punch up an offense that had scored 37 runs in 14 games
after the All-Star break, an average of 2.6 runs, and Houston came
through with four hits in his first four at-bats as a Dodger.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also hoped Houston's presence would motivate Beltre,
whose average, until Friday night, hadn't risen above .240 since June
28 and whose lack of discipline at the plate and occasional
lackadaisical play in the field have so frustrated the Dodgers they
explored a trade for Phillies' third baseman Scott Rolen last week.</TE>
<TE>   But Beltre seemed to take each Houston hit as a challenge Friday
night, coming through with his first four-hit game since May 13 and
setting a season high for RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Was there a correlation between Houston's performance and Beltre's
performance?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll let you decide," Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he may have sparked Beltre, Houston said, "Maybe ... if
that's what it takes to get it done, fine. The objective here is to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was especially pleased with the quality of Beltre's at-bats.
He stroked an RBI single over the second baseman's head in the first
and drove his three-run triple to the gap in right-center in the
second. He singled to right-center in the fourth, his third hit to
the opposite field, and lined a singled off the pitcher's foot in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we've been stressing for a long time," Tracy said.
"We know how good he is. We want him to understand how good he is."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants weren't very good Friday night, but they didn't field
exactly a varsity team. San Francisco's outfield--Barry Bonds,
Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Reggie Sanders--was sidelined because of strained
right hamstrings, and Shinjo was placed on the 15-day disabled list
Friday. First baseman J.T. Snow did not start because of flu-like
symptoms, and catcher Benito Santiago was out because of a sty in his
eye.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night's starting lineup included Tony Torcato, who was
making his major-league debut in right field, Ramon Martinez in left
field, Tom Goodwin in center, Yorvit Torrealba behind the plate and
Damon Minor at first.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Giants? This was more like the San Francisco (They
Might Be) Giants. And it showed.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin, the former Dodger who will never be confused with a Gold
Glove winner, appeared to have a chance to catch Houston's
first-inning triple over his head but missed after an awkward leap at
the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Torcato took an awful route on Beltre's second-inning triple,
giving himself no chance for a catch, and he dropped Paul Lo Duca's
fly ball over his head in the third, a ball that hit his glove and
was generously scored a double.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were much better in the clutch, scoring all three of
their runs in the first and all five in the second after two were
out.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan also knocked in a run with a groundout in the fifth,
the first RBI out of the Dodgers' cleanup spot in 15 games since the
All-Star break.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Tyler Houston was traded from Atlanta to the Chicago Cubs on June 27,
1996, and from the Cubs to Cleveland on Aug. 31, 1999, so he knows
all too well how traumatic it can be having to change teams during
the season. But those experiences didn't make his transition from
Milwaukee to the Dodgers any easier.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing helps--it's like being the new kid in the middle of the
school year," said Houston, who started at first base for the Dodgers
on Friday night after being acquired from the Brewers for two minor
league pitchers Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Not knowing too many people isn't bad. You kind of know guys from
playing against them. The most difficult part is getting myself to
relax so I can perform and not worry about the pressure. You come in
to a new team, you want to be great the first day. That's not how it
works. You're going to have bad days."</LD>
<TE>   Houston was so eager to start his new job he arrived at Pac Bell
Park at 12:45 p.m. Friday, almost seven hours before the game, to try
on his new uniform, shoes and to meet his new teammates. Leaving
Milwaukee (36-67) will do that to a guy.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a pretty light-hearted clubhouse, a fun
atmosphere," said Houston, who will also play third base. "Everyone
understands they've been struggling. I've been through a bad stretch
all year with my team. It always turns around. Well, probably not in
Milwaukee. I think it's going to get worse there."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have struggled to score runs since the All-Star break,
and they believe Houston's left-handed bat--he hit .302 with seven
home runs and 33 runs batted in--will add power and balance to a
predominantly right-handed lineup. He made an immediate impact Friday
night with a two-run triple in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means am I a savior," Houston said. "I'm here to help. I
understand they could use another left-handed bat. That's what I
bring to the table."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Brown's rehabilitation from June 11 surgery for a
herniated disk is progressing rapidly, but pitcher Darren Dreifort's
rehabilitation from major elbow surgery has hit a snag.</TE>
<TE>   Brown threw 70 pitches in the Dodger Stadium bullpen Friday, and
the reports, according to Manager Jim Tracy, were that Brown was
"sharp, crisp ... his best bullpen to date."</TE>
<TE>   Brown will throw again Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, however, had to cut Friday's light bullpen session off
at 20 pitches because of a sore right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still some pain, so why push it?" Dreifort said. "That
would be dumb."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger first baseman Eric Karros remained in Los Angeles on Friday
to be with his wife, Trish, who was due to deliver the couple's third
child.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Friday night whether Karros would travel to San
Francisco in time for today's game.</TE>

up with a loss and two no-decisions. Hernandez has limited opponents

<LD>The talk around the Galaxy compound these days is about timepieces.
Pricey brand names such as Rolex, Tag Heuer, Movado and, for the more
budget conscious, even Fossils are floating around, and for good
reason.</LD>
<LD>   Alexi Lalas made a bet with Carlos Ruiz that if the rookie forward
from Guatemala scored 15 goals on the season, Lalas would buy him a
new watch.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz has 14 goals before tonight's match at the Rose Bowl against
the Columbus Crew.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what kind of watch he's going to get me," Ruiz said
with a laugh, "but he's going to owe me one soon. It will be a great
gift for my first year here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lalas: "A deal's a deal. I figure that it's a small price to
pay for 15 goals."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, the Galaxy's ninth discovery pick, has taken Major League
Soccer by storm, scoring two goals in each of his first two games. He
is second in MLS scoring to New England midfielder Taylor Twellman,
who has 15. Ruiz also is second, along with Ariel Graziani, in points
with 28. Twellman leads with 34.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas doesn't want success to come too easily to Ruiz, though.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I figure it," Lalas joked, "I have to take away some of
his goals. Some were pretty ugly, and I'm sure I've assisted on
others, and he had a couple of penalty kicks. So I think he's really
only scored about six goals. It's all about style points from here on
in."</TE>
<TE>   And it's also about Ruiz, who was selected last week as a starter
for the MLS All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of watch he gets will reflect how he plays after getting
No. 15," Lalas said, "how he handles it from there--if he settles or
goes for more.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who scores that many goals should get a watch. I figure
the Galaxy ought to go out and buy watches in gross."</TE>

<LD>J.P. Hayes shot a course-record 10-under-par 61 on Friday for a share
of the second-round lead with Fred Funk in the John Deere Classic at
Silvas, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   Hayes broke the TPC of Deere Run record of 62 shared by Kirk
Triplett, David Frost and Pat Bates. Triplett and Frost shot their
62s in 2000, the first year the event was played on the course, and
Bates matched the mark Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Funk, coming off a second-place finish last week in the B.C. Open,
shot his second consecutive 64 to match Hayes at 14 under.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Gamez was a stroke back after a 64, and 2001 runner-up
Briny Baird (64) and Nolan Henke (65) followed at 11 under. Bates
joined first-round leader Mike Heinen (69) in a five-player group at
10 under, and B.C. Open winner Spike McRoy (67) was nine under.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes, the 1998 Buick Classic winner, had 11 birdies and a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelli Kuehne birdied the first three holes en route to a six-under
65 and a two-stroke lead after the second round of the LPGA Big Apple
Classic at New Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Johnson matched the 65 to move into second at six-under 136,
but she went the other way from Kuehne, making birdies on the last
three holes at Wykagyl Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, seeking her seventh tour victory of the
year, had a 66 to join South Korea's Hee-Won Han (67) at five under.
Beth Daniel (65) was four under along with Gloria Park (67), Kim
Saiki (67) and Sherri Steinhauer (69).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bob Gilder shot a six-under 66 to take a one-stroke lead over five
players, including two-time defending champion Larry Nelson, in the
FleetBoston Classic at Concord, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Gilder, coming off a playoff victory over Hale Irwin last week in
the SBC Senior Open in Chicago, had a five-under 31 on the back nine
at the Nashawtuc Country Club, getting birdies on Nos. 16 and 18.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer had the shot of the day, holing a 40-yard eagle chip
on the par-five 10th. The 72-year-old Palmer shot a 75, his best
round of the year in five senior events and three PGA Tour starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Watson had the only bogey-free round of the Senior British

<HD>Hubbard Resigns in Pinnacle Purge</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The Glendale-based gaming company he chaired
could be facing sanctions in Indiana.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>After an executive shakeup at Pinnacle Entertainment Inc., formed
three years ago in the aftermath of the sale of Hollywood Park to
Churchill Downs, the Glendale-based gaming company may face sanctions
Monday at a meeting of the Indiana Gaming Commission.</LD>
<LD>   R.D. Hubbard, a prominent owner and breeder of thoroughbreds who
led a proxy fight that resulted in the ouster of Marje Everett as
chairman of Hollywood Park in 1991, has resigned as chairman of
Pinnacle and begun a divestiture of his stock. Since mid-April, he
has sold at least $6.9 million of stock. He had been the biggest
personal shareholder in Hollywood Park before it was sold to
Churchill Downs in 1999 and was also the largest Pinnacle investor.</LD>
<LD>   Some of Hubbard's fellow board members at Pinnacle were upset
after the Indiana Gaming Commission announced in May that the
company's license at the Belterra Casino and Resort on the Ohio River
was in jeopardy. Eight or more women, referred to by the commission
as prostitutes, allegedly were brought to Belterra last year to
entertain 48 high rollers who had been invited to a golf tournament.
Some Pinnacle board members didn't learn of the controversy until
well after the Indiana investigation had begun.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Alanis, the chief executive officer of Pinnacle, has
resigned. Also dropping off the board is Robert Manfuso, a Maryland
horse breeder and former minority owner of the Pimlico and Laurel
Park racetracks there.</TE>
<TE>   Reached Friday at Saratoga, Manfuso said his resignation was not
related to Pinnacle's problems in Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a racing guy, and was on the board of the old Hollywood Park
company for that reason," Manfuso said. "When Hollywood Park Inc.
became Pinnacle, I didn't really fit with the casino and gaming mix.
But from what I understand about what happened in Indiana, I think
the gaming commission there is overreacting to this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Besides leaving the company, Hubbard has agreed to either sell his
Pinnacle stock or put his interests in a trust, as well as cease to
do business with the company. Hubbard reportedly will pay a $750,000
fine, and Pinnacle also could be hit with a substantial fine, which
has been estimated at $2 million. Jack Thar, executive director of
the Indiana Gaming Commission, said that a hefty fine for Pinnacle
has been discussed by the commission's seven members.</TE>
<TE>   "The settlement proposed [by Pinnacle in May] has not been
accepted," Thar said. "There's been no final action. Whether this
comes up Monday remains to be seen. The purpose of the meeting is to
discuss other things, unrelated to Belterra, and the Belterra
situation might not come up at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Three telephone messages left with Hubbard's attorney, Theodore
Nicholas, were not answered.</TE>
<TE>   One golfer who attended the tournament last summer at Belterra
said that he was aware the women were there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were brought in from Las Vegas," said the golfer,
who asked that his name not be used. "There was nothing out of line
as far as the tournament was concerned. But what happened [at a
party] after the tournament, I can't vouch for."</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle owns seven casino resorts in Indiana, Nevada, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Argentina. It also operates card clubs at Hollywood
Park, in Inglewood and in Compton. When Churchill Downs Inc. bought
the Hollywood Park racetrack, it agreed to lease the card club to
Pinnacle for 10 years at $3 million annually. The Hollywood card club
is wired for Las Vegas-style slot machines, which are not legal
except in Indian casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Alanis' annual salary was $600,000 and Hubbard was paid $500,000 a
year. Daniel Lee, Pinnacle's new chairman and chief executive, is a
former chief financial officer who was associated with Steve Wynn's
casino properties in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Pinnacle, which was trading at about $5 a share in February,
reached a 52-week high of $12.68 on May 3. The stock closed at $7.50
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hubbard, who owns Ruidoso Downs, a quarter horse track in New
Mexico, is one of three applicants who want to build a racetrack and
casino in Hobbs, N.M., near the Texas border. Slot machines there
bring in an estimated $54 million a year. The license is expected to
be issued at a meeting of the New Mexico Racing Commission on Aug.
27.</TE>
<TE>   "[Hubbard's troubles] in Indiana are an issue we're aware of,"
said Julian Luna, executive director of the commission. "I don't know
if it will be a factor in New Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beat Hollow, ranked by the Daily Racing Form as the best turf male
in the country, will carry high weight of 122 pounds Sunday in the
$400,000 Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar. Beat Hollow will be ridden
by Alex Solis. Also running, at 118 pounds, is Redattore, winner of
the stake last year. Rounding out the six-horse field are Deploy
Venture, Sarafan, Night Patrol and Casey Griffin.... Trainer Bill
Mott saddled the winner of Saratoga's Bernard Baruch Handicap for the
fourth straight year when Del Mar Show won the $200,000 stake Friday.
Jerry Bailey has ridden all four Mott winners, including Yagli in
1999 and Hap the last two years.</TE>

<HD>Big Race for Kona Gold</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A couple of the excuses offered for Kona Gold's loss in the Triple
Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap on July 6 at Hollywood Park were
priceless.</LD>
<LD>   After the 8-year-old gelding finished sixth at 4-5 in the Grade
II, trainer and part owner Bruce Headley pointed to the 126 pounds
the 13-time winner had to carry. This was a staggering one pound more
than he had carried to victory in the Los Angeles Handicap five weeks
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Others have reasoned that he was too close to the pace in the
Triple Bend. This would hold some water had the winner of the race
rallied from far back, but the fact is Disturbingthepeace, the winner
at 16-1, led virtually from start to finish and D'wildcat, the
runner-up, was second almost the entire journey, and they simply ran
away from the 2000 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner in the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   Kona Gold simply may not be as good as he used to be. He had
little behind him in the Los Angeles Handicap and he lost his final
three starts last year.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not he has lost a couple steps will be determined today
as he tries for his third consecutive win in the $200,000 Bing Crosby
Breeders' Cup Handicap, a Grade II at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the two Crosby victories, Kona Gold has three other wins
at Del Mar and has never lost by the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Surya will make her Grade I debut against Grade I winners
Golden Apples, Janet and Affluent in the $400,000 John Mabee/Ramona
Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bobby Frankel, who trains Surya, will try for two
graded stakes wins at Saratoga with Beefeater Baby and Tates Creek in
the $500,000 Diana Handicap and You in the $250,000 Test Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Rene Douglas. The defending champion at Arlington Park
is running away with the jockey title again. He won with 65 of his
first 224 mounts, putting him 21 winners ahead of Elvis Trujillo.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Nick Santagata. The jockey opened Monmouth Park with
only two wins from his first 42 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Parhelion in the seventh
and Surya in the eighth; Throw Me Roses, Lady Katy Did, Go Natalie
Go, Miss Tropics and Script Girl in the ninth and World Of Fun,
Moscow Nights, F'rilly Miss and Maria's Friend in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 2/3. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $11.60/$16.60. Total money bet: $34.</TE>

<DH>Former Cowboy Michael Irvin is working hard at being a good
broadcaster and a better family man</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Irvin, in Lake Tahoe last week for a celebrity golf
tournament, was talking with a reporter about how focused he is on
his daily workouts.</LD>
<LD>   "Sounds like you're monomaniacal," the reporter said.</LD>
<LD>   "Monomaniacal, that's a great word," Irvin said. "What does it
mean?"</LD>
<TE>   The reporter told him it means excessive interest in one thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to use it tonight on the show," Irvin said.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Irvin called on his cell phone. "Did you hear me use
your word, monomaniacal?" he said. "You got another word for me
today?"</TE>
<TE>   Two years since retiring from football, Irvin, who commutes to Los
Angeles from his home outside Dallas to work regularly on Fox's "Best
Damn Sports Show Period," seems as monomaniacal about his new career
in broadcasting as he was about catching passes.</TE>
<TE>   In 12 seasons as a wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, he played
on three Super Bowl championship teams, made the Pro Bowl five
seasons in a row, led the NFL in yards receiving in 1991 with a
club-record 1,523 and finished his career with 11,904 yards receiving
and 750 receptions, both club records.</TE>
<TE>   But with his fame came trouble.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he pleaded no contest to felony drug possession after he,
former teammate Alfredo Roberts and two strippers were busted in a
motel room where cocaine and marijuana were found. That was only one
of his run-ins with the law.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin says he was never addicted to drugs. His addiction was sex.
It was an addiction that almost cost him everything. He eventually
hit bottom.</TE>
<TE>   That happened, he says, on Valentine's Day, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The previous night, he came home after being gone for two days. He
left again but promised wife Sandi he'd be back in an hour.</TE>
<TE>   He came back the next morning, after spending the night with
another woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I was with my brother Derrick," he said in a recent interview.
"We drove past a bar and he suggested stopping for one drink. I said,
'OK, but only one drink.'</TE>
<TE>   "I would always tell myself I was going to have only one drink.
Then a bad woman would come over, and sometimes she'd bring a friend.
That was always my excuse to myself for having another drink--bad
women."</TE>
<TE>   The drinks often led to partying and illicit sex. Drugs were
usually involved, at least until Irvin quit doing drugs following his
1996 drug conviction. He had little choice in the matter then.</TE>
<TE>   "I was put on probation for four years and was tested for drugs
four or five times a week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about self-esteem. I lacked self-esteem, going all the
way back to kindergarten [in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.]. I couldn't read
or write, but the white kids could. I thought, 'I'm just a dumb black
kid.'</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize the white kids had been to preschool.</TE>
<TE>   "That lack of self-esteem stays with you. You're always trying to
prove to everybody how great you are, how perfect you are.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me [excessive] in football. That's also what all the
women were about. I had to prove to everyone I could get a lot of
women, that I was perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think I could do everything myself. I didn't need to
play anybody's game, I was going to do it my way.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I showed up in court after my drug charge wearing a
mink coat. It was a dumb thing to do, but I was going to show
everyone I was doing it my way."</TE>
<TE>   Irvin attributes most of his own troubles to his sex addiction,
which isn't much different than being addicted to drugs and alcohol.
It's something Irvin will have to always battle.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't beat a sex addiction any more than you can beat
alcoholism," said Dr. John Sealy, the medical director of the sexual
addiction recovery program at Del Amo Hospital in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it getting into recovery, rather than being recovered.
Each day you make a commitment to stay in recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Irvin said he has made a commitment to God, which Sealy said is
one way of handling it.</TE>
<TE>   There are many ways to act out on the addiction, be it on the
Internet or with prostitutes, according to Sealy.</TE>
<TE>   "Or by picking up girls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Irvin, finding women to feed his addiction was never a
problem, particularly in Dallas, where he enjoyed superstar status.</TE>
<TE>   "As a man, you really don't think about women hitting on you," he
said. "Women get hit on all the time, but not men. Well, believe me,
I got hit on all the time."</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, he usually obliged.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin, 36, went into a depression after he retired in July 2000.
He was drinking and chasing women, sometimes staying out all night.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned home Valentine's morning last year after another
night of extramarital sex, he said he broke down, got on his knees
and cried. So did Sandi.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I was very disappointed, but he was also very
disappointed in himself," Sandi said by telephone from the Irvins'
home in the Dallas suburb of Plano.</TE>
<TE>   "He was usually late, but he never promised he would be home at a
certain time. It's hard to get him to promise to do anything because
he doesn't want to break the promise.</TE>
<TE>   "This time he had broken his promise, and I think that's what made
him realize he had no control."</TE>
<TE>   Her words were not much different then than they were other times
when Irvin got into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi, devoutly religious, told Michael, "You have to make peace
with God. Baby, you have to pray and ask God for strength."</TE>
<TE>   Pray they did. They checked into a hotel room, ordered room
service and prayed all night.</TE>
<TE>   The next Sunday, Irvin went to church with Sandi and prayed some
more. About a month later, he spoke at a revival meeting and publicly
apologized to Sandi.</TE>
<TE>   He also quit drinking alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Michael and Sandi, who have four children--two boys, two
girls--renewed their marriage vows on June 23 while attending a
marriage seminar in Jacksonville, Fla. It was their 12th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi, who met Irvin while both were at the University of Miami,
has a high-pitched voice that personifies sweetness, and the voice
tells a lot about the person.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin calls Sandi the "greatest blessing of my life." He said if
she hadn't stuck by him he may not have survived.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he is as religious as she is, maybe more so.</TE>
<TE>   He regularly recites scriptures, continually says, "God bless you"
to those around him, and refuses to use bad language.</TE>
<TE>   He won't even say "Best Damn Sports Show Period." He prefers to
call the show "BDSSP," thus avoiding the word "damn."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Arnold, who is also on "Best Damn Sports Show," was a recent
guest on David Letterman's show. When Arnold mentioned Irvin was now
on the show--"He has been arrested almost as many times as I have,"
Arnold cracked--Letterman asked, "How did that happen? ... Wasn't
this the guy with the drugs, guns and strippers?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Arnold: "He doesn't have drugs, guns and strippers now, he
has Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold also said, "He embraces his past, so you can make fun of
him, which is nice. Lots of times those guys get religious and don't
like to talk about the drugs, guns and strippers. But we can make our
jokes. He's great."</TE>
<TE>   Said Letterman: "So he's clean and sober?"</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," said Arnold, himself a recovering alcoholic. "They
asked me to look into his eyes. They asked me, 'Can you guarantee
he'll stay sober?'</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, I can't guarantee I'll stay sober."</TE>
<TE>   One person who doesn't think Irvin will revert to his former ways
is Louis Moreno, who supervised Irvin's probation following his 1996
drug conviction. It was three years of intensive supervision and
another year of minimum supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno says Irvin did all the right things, passed all his drug
tests and fulfilled his 800 hours of his community service work
obligation, mostly in central Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones thinks enough of Irvin to have hired him
as the television commentator for his Arena Football League team, the
Dallas Desperados.</TE>
<TE>   The play-by-play announcer is Brad Sham, the radio voice of the
Cowboys for the last 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't socialize with Michael when he was a player, so I can't
personally attest to what he was like then," Sham said. "But I'm
certainly aware of his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I spend a great deal of time with him on the road, and he is
not what he used to be. He is faithful to his wife, he is not
drinking and he is not swearing.</TE>
<TE>   "These religious conversions tend to breed skepticism, and if you
don't know Michael you may feel that skepticism."</TE>
<TE>   Sham is not skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Even knowing what we know about how these life reformations can
go," he said, "it appears he has turned his life around dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in his hotel room on the road and he is either reading
his game notes or reading the Bible or he has his laptop up and
running."</TE>
<TE>   Irvin says he puts as much effort into his new lifestyle as he did
his old one.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be the best in football, and now I want to be the
best in broadcasting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He knows he needs work, particularly on his diction and grammar.
That's why he's working with voice specialist Arthur Joseph, founder
of the Vocal Awareness Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph said he has rarely seen anyone as dedicated as Irvin.</TE>
<TE>   "I love his effort, and I love his discipline," Joseph said.</TE>
<TE>   He likes some things that he sees and hears, cringing at others.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin continually has trouble using the correct verb tense. During
a recent show, he was doing fine until he interviewed Shaquille
O'Neal, then the old Irvin came out. He said things such as, "Tom
Arnold's always talking about he live next door to you."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph is working on such things, and more.</TE>
<TE>   "He affects your whole life," Irvin said. "He has got me reading
the front page of the newspaper for the first time in my life. I used
to only read the sports section."</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net first hired Irvin on the day he announced he was
retiring from football. But a month later Irvin was arrested in a
woman's North Dallas apartment, where police found marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin admits to going to the woman's apartment to have sex but
says he was unaware of the marijuana. It was determined later that
the police had conducted an illegal search of the apartment. The
charges were dropped, but the damage had already been done and the
network dropped him.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, George Greenberg, the executive producer of "Best
Damn Sports Show Period," went to Dallas to conduct auditions. Irvin
was among those auditioning, even though David Hill, the chairman of
Fox Sports, had said Irvin would never work for Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael was great in the audition," Greenberg said. "The problem
was convincing David we should hire him."</TE>
<TE>   Hill said he changed his mind about Irvin after talking with Jones
and Pat Summerall.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry and Pat gave him great character references," Hill said.
"It appeared he had seen the error of his ways, so we decided to give
him another shot. He is a wonderful, affable person and he has come
out of the box strong."</TE>
<TE>   Summerall says he and Irvin have become close and that he and his
wife Cheri sometimes go to church with Michael and Sandi. Summerall
said whenever Irvin gets up to speak in church, or wherever he makes
a public speech, it is something to behold.</TE>
<TE>   When Irvin was hired by Fox Sports Net for a second time on June
4, it was announced that he would be part of "The NFL Show," formerly
"NFL This Morning." (The name was changed because this season the
show will be televised Saturday nights, then repeated Sunday
mornings.)</TE>
<TE>   But Greenberg also knew he was going to find a regular spot for
Irvin on his show, "BDSSP," as Irvin calls it.</TE>
<TE>   "If Michael stays on track, he'll be the next big talent on
television from the players' world," Greenberg said.</TE>

<HD>Career Intercepted: Leaf Calls It Quits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled quarterback Ryan Leaf has, at least for now, ended a career
of unfulfilled promise, failing to show for the start of Seattle
Seahawks' training camp and informing the team he is retiring from
football.</LD>
<LD>   Leaf was not at Seahawk camp at Eastern Washington University in
Cheney, Wash., on Thursday when quarterbacks were due to report.</LD>
<LD>   Team officials had no further comment, except to say that Coach
Mike Holmgren would address the situation after practice today. Leaf
and his agent, David Dunn, did not return phone calls, but Seattle
starting quarterback Trent Dilfer said he spoke with Leaf on Thursday
night and learned that Leaf planned to retire.</LD>
<TE>   "He seems at peace with it," Dilfer said. "I was surprised. I
thought he had very productive minicamps and was learning and had
turned a page in his career and was building back up."</TE>
<TE>   Leaf, 26, signed a one-year, $525,000 contract with Seattle in
May, one day after his release from the Dallas Cowboys. The No. 2
overall pick behind Peyton Manning in the 1998 draft by the San Diego
Chargers, Leaf never found stardom, only four unspectacular and
controversial seasons in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   He appeared in 25 games for San Diego and Dallas, completing 317
of 655 passes for 3,666 yards with 14 touchdowns and 36
interceptions. Leaf will most likely be remembered for a rap sheet of
social maladies that includes run-ins with fans, teammates and
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after signing a reported five-year, $31.2-million contract
with San Diego--which included an $11.25-million signing bonus--Leaf
earned the nickname "Baby Boy" from teammates because of his
immaturity.</TE>
<TE>   A tantrum in the locker room that same year was replayed countless
times on television. In 1999, he confronted a fan during training
camp and served a four-week suspension later that year for
criticizing Bobby Beathard, the Chargers' general manager at the
time. He sat out that season after undergoing shoulder surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he left a preseason workout outraged after teammate Fred
McCray chastised the quarterback for being "fat" and "out of shape."
Other teammates openly criticized Leaf during that season and he was
released by the Chargers in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to catch on with Tampa Bay but failed that team's
physical. Dallas took a chance and signed Leaf, who couldn't pass the
Cowboys' physical at first because of an injury to his right wrist.
He finally signed with Dallas in October of that year and started
three games, all losses. The Cowboys released him in May.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Johnson, who coached Leaf at Charles M. Russell High in Great
Falls, Mont., heard the news of Leaf's retirement Thursday from Brady
Leaf, Ryan's younger brother who will be Johnson's starting
quarterback this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of years have been frustrating for [Ryan],"
Johnson said. "I'm disappointed, his family is disappointed, Brady is
shook up. It's shocking. I thought he could compete for the
[starting] job."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was drafted after Manning, many scouts had said that
the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Leaf had more raw talent. Leaf has struggled
since injuring his wrist against the Seahawks in 2000, but he was
sharp in a June minicamp.</TE>
<TE>   "His ability to pass is going to be hugely important to him in the
future," Holmgren said then. "In Dallas, he said [the wrist] didn't
bother him. It hasn't bothered him since he's been here. But he had
an injury to it and any time a quarterback injures something like his
wrist, you're going to be thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Holmgren will open the season with Dilfer as his No. 1 quarterback
and Matt Hasselbeck as his backup.</TE>
<TE>   Leaf would have been competing for the No. 3 job against rookies
Jeff Kelly of Southern Mississippi and Ryan Van Dyke of Michigan
State.</TE>

<LD>In Rob Cucher's letter to Viewpoint [July 13], he had the gall to all
but call Tom Lasorda a liar for claiming to have once phoned Frank
Sinatra at 3 o'clock in the morning. Cucher also impugned The Times
for believing and printing Lasorda's story.</LD>
<LD>   Lasorda clearly stated he was on the East Coast when he made that
3 a.m. call. Sinatra lived on the West Coast. Therefore, it was only
midnight for Sinatra, a man known to just be going out at that hour.
Oh, if only Frank were alive to punch Cucher in the mouth.</LD>

<LD>I can't help but notice how the content of The Times Sports page has
changed. This week has featured the soccer "Daily Report" each day,
filled with news totally uninteresting to 99% of your readers. Today
[July 11], for example, were such blockbuster items as "The Greek
club AEK has signed a second player from Costa Rica's World Cup team"
and "Barcelona has signed Argentine midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme
from Boca Juniors."</LD>
<LD>   Who cares about this? Certainly not American readers who are
deprived of local sports by your obsession with soccer or political
correctness. Get real! Your readers have no interest in the WNBA,
MLS, WUSA, etc. It's a waste of vital space to continue to cover
these "sports" that nobody cares about!</LD>

<LD>First my stocks take a dive, then the dog turns on me for not walking
her enough, and just when I thought it couldn't get worse, turns out
my beloved Dodgers are manic-depressive. More than needing a second
baseman who hits for average, outfielders who can hit at all or even
team defense, this team needs a therapist--in a hurry! What's next, a
strike? Oops, never mind!</LD>

<TE>   Let's play a little game called "Who Am I?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hi. I have a seven-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers for $15
million a year. I also have access to a private jet to use whenever I
want. Over my first four years with the club, I've contributed rather
little because I'm as fragile as fine porcelain china. This year,
I've started fewer than 10 games and have an ERA over 4.00. I'm also
not very friendly. And even though my family and I have more money
than we'd ever be able to spend in a lifetime, and even though I
almost never play, I have not offered to give a dime of my salary
back so that my team may be able to afford the player or players they
need to win a pennant. Who am I?"</TE>
<TE>   Sneaky Sims</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't think the fans really understand. See, it's not really
about winning. It's all about chemistry. What's most important is
that everyone on the Dodgers really likes each other. Recognizing
you're in a pennant race and actually trying to score more runs than
your opponents are relatively unimportant as long as there's harmony
and happiness in the clubhouse. So, whatever the Dodgers do, they
mustn't hurt anyone's feelings. They must not get rid of anyone or
add anyone that might upset that delicate chemical balance. I mean,
we're talking about the NL West champs of the 2002 halfway point.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, Evans, Daly and Fox, we fans just want to thank you for a fun
first half. We know how poor News Corp. and Fox are, and, to be
honest, we don't really know much about baseball, but hey ... that
Adrian Beltre sure seems like a nice kid.</TE>

<LD>   Sitting at last month's equivalent of an NBA poker party, the NBA
draft, and holding a pair of deuces, the 27th pick in the first
round, Mitch Kupchak hit the jackpot. Instead of folding his hand and
mailing in his pick, Mitch:</LD>
<LD>   * Acquired an athletic shooting guard, Kareem Rush, who, after his
sophomore season in college, was projected to be a lottery pick;</LD>
<TE>   * Unloaded Lindsey Hunter's salary when he traded the point guard
to Toronto in order to acquire the rights to Rush;</TE>
<TE>   * Obtained from Toronto Tracy Murray, a superb three-point shooter
who will strengthen the Lakers' perimeter game;</TE>
<TE>   * Created enough cap room to sign Devean George to a long-term
contract.</TE>
<TE>   With each passing day, Mitch sets his own standard of excellence
in maintaining and writing new chapters of the rich history and
tradition of the Los Angeles Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lallas</TE>

Shaquille O'Neill with a simpatico teammate. Shaq enjoys riding with
the police, and Polynice enjoys impersonating them.</TE>

<LD>On Tuesday night I was watching in the ninth inning of the Angel game
when Adam Kennedy jogged around first on a "routine" popup that the
A's shortstop dropped. If Kennedy had been hustling, he would have
been on second with none out. Instead, his dogging it forced the
Angels to use an out to get him there. Eventually, the Angels lost.</LD>
<LD>   I am very tired of seeing millionaire ballplayers give up on
"routine outs." The second baseman fields a grounder, and even before
he throws to first, the batter stops running. Infielders do make bad
throws to first, first basemen do drop balls, and fielders do miss
easy fly balls. That's why we teach kids to keep running until the
umpire signals they are out.</LD>
<LD>   Mistakes are human. But lack of effort at the salaries these guys
get is not excusable.</LD>

paid to hit a ball, and Anna gets paid to, well, pretty much just
stand there. And that is all I need from them, or any other
athlete/celebrity for that matter. Michael Jordan rarely speaks out
about social issues, but I have never watched him make a spectacular
play, then thought, "I wonder who he sides with, the Israelis or the
Palestinians?"</TE>
<TE>   I am not saying athletes should not have opinions, or that they
shouldn't use their status for positive change, I just don't think
it's part of their job description.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Robinson, Jesse Owens, Billie Jean King all stand out as
athletes who made a difference with their actions or their words, and
should be admired for their courage. Who knows where we would be
without them. But for every one of them, I offer a John Rocker, a
Fuzzy Zoeller, a Bobby Knight, to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   I do believe athletes have a certain responsibility to give back,
whether it be time, money or both. But I would rather see Tiger
continue to spend time with his foundation, helping to get kids off
the streets, than to make sure rich women get to be members at
Augusta.</TE>

<LD>Baseball fans are now searching for the replacement for Ted Williams
as the best living ex-player. Most knowledgeable fans point
immediately to Willie Mays, and with justification. Willie was one of
the most exciting players to play the game. Baseball and its players
live and die on their statistics. Every team and every player is
measured on the stats they produce and those stats usually rank
players and teams in history. I have no problem calling Willie Mays a
great player, but I think we need to take a closer look at who should
be called "the best living ex-player."</LD>
<LD>   If we look at the stats of Stan Musial, we will see he outdid
Willie in almost every category, offensively and defensively. The
only stat that stands out for Mays is the home run category, far and
away. In all others, Stan is the Man.</LD>

<LD>If Morning Snow wins for the fifth time in six starts tonight, the
2-year-old This Snow Is Royal filly will be two-thirds of the way to
a very healthy bonus.</LD>
<LD>   By virtue of her victory in the Kindergarten Futurity on May 18,
the Texas-bred is the only horse eligible to win a $1-million bonus
by sweeping the Kindergarten, Ed Burke Memorial Futurity and Los
Alamitos Million.</LD>
<LD>   She'll try to win the 350-yard Burke, a Grade I that carries a
$436,000 purse, against nine others. Morning Snow is the 5-2 second
choice in Ed Burgart's morning line.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Charles and Dixie Patterson and trained by Donna
McArthur, Morning Snow is unbeaten in three races at Los Alamitos and
upset stablemate Lonely Moon Sign when taking the Kindergarten by a
neck.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-5 morning line favorite is Straw Flying Dash, who was the
fastest qualifier for the Burke as he sizzled 350 yards in 17.38
seconds. He is unbeaten in three starts for owners Micah Leslie and
Link Newcomb and trainer Dan Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Private Flyin. 2. Frenchly. 3. Woody Dot Com. 4.
Bluegrass Prince. 5. Mary Blue Beduino. 6. Issues Falstaff. 7. Braces
Keeper. 8. Pats Charming Guy. 9. Straw Flying Dash. 10. Especialy Red
Hot. 11. Lucky Red Hot.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Private Flyin and OK Leter Rip in the first, single
Frenchly in the second, use The Prince Is Back, Woody Dot Com and
Flirtatious Fred in the third and First Perfect Royal, Bluegrass
Prince, Beduinos Breeze and Bud A Bing in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: India Lee makes her first start for sharp
trainer Adan Farias in the seventh. Red Lipstick has won all four of
her starts and has to be respected again at healthy odds in the 10th.</TE>

<LD>Bill Elliott was the fastest qualifier for the second week in a row,
and he tied the record Friday for the most career poles at Pocono
Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, in the Pennsylvania 500, Elliott will try to become the
first driver to win five times on the mountaintop.</LD>
<LD>   The pole was his fourth this year--giving Elliott the lead in the
Winston Cup series--and the 55th overall for the 46-year-old.</LD>
<TE>   It also was his fifth at Pocono, matching Ken Schrader's track
record.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott's Dodge sped around the 2 1/2-mile triangular-shaped track
in 52.765 seconds, posting a fast lap of 170.568 mph.</TE>
<TE>   That was far short of Tony Stewart's two-year-old track record of
172.391.</TE>
<TE>   Second-fastest was Ricky Rudd, whose Ford got around in 170.358.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Waltrip overcame a brush with the wall in practice and
wound up qualifying third.</TE>
<TE>   Driving a Chevrolet missing its number on the right side after a

One career.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been through so much in my Formula One career and achieved
a lot and I just didn't think it was worth it to push things any
further," Hakkinen said in a recorded message played during practice
at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's practice, Michael Schumacher had the fastest time (1
minute 16.086 seconds), followed by Ferrari teammate Rubens
Barrichello (1:16.248) and Raikkonen (1:16.344).</TE>

<HD>Vaughn Picks His Spot in Met Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth, Met slugger Mo Vaughn
turned to his teammates in the dugout and called his shot-- a single.</LD>
<LD>   "He told us he had seen enough of these curveballs, he was just
going to hit the ball up the middle," New York Manager Bobby
Valentine said.</LD>
<LD>   Vaughn came to the plate with two outs and the bases loaded. Then
he sent the first pitch he saw from John Riedling back up the middle
to give the Mets a 3-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night
at New York.</LD>
<TE>   "You're going to get your home runs," Vaughn said. "But I want to
get my average up where it belongs. And you do that by getting
singles too. By staying in the middle of the field, you have a better
chance of success."</TE>
<TE>   After Vaughn's hit, Rey Ordonez ran home with his hands in the air
as the screaming Merengue Night crowd of 46,466 made Shea Stadium
shake.</TE>
<TE>   Ordonez led off the ninth with a single. Pinch-hitter Marco
Scutaro advanced him with a sacrifice bunt and Roberto Alomar was
intentionally walked.</TE>
<TE>   Timo Perez grounded into a fielder's choice--avoiding the double
play--and Mike Piazza walked to load the bases and bring up Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   Riedling (0-1) had no place to put Vaughn, who entered the game
batting .278 with runners in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the Mets' ninth in 12 games and tied them with the
Reds at 53-49 as they chased the NL's wild card spot.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a long way to go," Valentine said.</TE>
<TE>   Met reliever Mark Guthrie (5-0), who extended his scoreless streak
to 25 1/3 innings, hit Ken Griffey Jr. in the batting helmet with a
pitch in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The ball struck with an audible crack, and broke Griffey's batting
helmet. Trainers rushed onto the field, helped Griffey to his feet,
and he went to first base as fans cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie came to the plate to check on Griffey, and later phoned
the Reds' clubhouse to check on Junior, who said after the game that
he was fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Guthrie's not that kind of a pitcher," Griffey said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, who had been booed before each of his at-bats, was later
caught in a rundown after Guthrie's pickoff throw to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar began the night with his 2,500th career hit in the first
inning and went three for three.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 12, San Diego 0--Randy Johnson returned to form against
the Padres, pitching four-hit ball for seven innings at Phoenix as
the Diamondbacks won their fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (14-4) was coming off his worst game of the season--an
eight-hit, eight-run, six-walk performance Sunday in which he lasted
only five innings in the Padres' 11-9 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had been 8-0 lifetime before that loss. But this time he
struck out eight and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Chicago 4--Jim Edmonds, Tino Martinez and Eduardo
Perez all homered, powering the Cardinals at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Finley, acquired last week in a trade with Cleveland, won in
his Busch Stadium debut before the largest crowd of the season at
48,730. Edgar Renteria got two hits to reach 1,000 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Finley (2-0) gave up three runs and five hits in six innings,
striking out seven and walking none.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Atlanta 2--Gary Sheffield grounded out with the
bases loaded to end the game as the Phillies won at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, playing a night game for the first time in a week,
won their fourth in a row. It's their longest streak since June 7-10,
when they also won four in a row during interleague play.</TE>
<TE>   After the Braves loaded the bases with two outs in the ninth
inning against Jose Mesa, Sheffield hit an easy grounder. Mesa held
on for his 28th save in 34 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Pittsburgh 3--Julio Lugo hit a game-winning single with
two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to bail out Astro closer
Billy Wagner at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   After Wagner (3-2) gave up a game-tying homer to Aramis Ramirez in
the ninth, the Astros won it in the bottom half to reach .500 for the
first time since May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Florida 5--Jose Vidro hit a leadoff home run in the
bottom of the 10th inning, lifting the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   After right fielder Vladimir Guerrero threw out Tim Raines at the
plate to end the top of the 10th, Vidro won it with his 11th homer.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 10, Colorado 3--Mark Loretta hit his career first grand
slam and Ben Sheets won for the second time in 15 starts as the
Brewers won at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta connected for the slam in the third inning off Denny Stark
(6-2) for his first homer since Aug. 22, 2001. It followed singles by
Richie Sexson and Matt Stairs and a walk to Jose Hernandez, giving
Sheets (5-12) a 6-0 lead.</TE>

<HD>Roddick's Got Next, if He Likes It or Not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Roddick is being asked to become Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick is expected to be a classy, focused, Grand Slam-winning
machine and to also be full of vim and vigor and charming
unreliability. He is supposed to be No. 1 in the world and to have
won a Wimbledon or U.S. Open by now.</LD>
<LD>   That's what happens when your country has been blessed with
watching the extraordinary talents of two of the greatest champions
in tennis history, watching them be rivals for a decade, watching
them dominate the sport.</LD>
<TE>   But Roddick is still a kid, a 19-year-old who did time on "The
Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn" wearing jeans so faded they were
almost invisible and a tousled T-shirt that must have been pulled out
of the laundry basket.</TE>
<TE>   For a year now, Roddick has been tabbed as the single hope of U.S.
men's tennis, the only young man with the game and the charisma to
take the place of both Sampras and Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   This has happened because Roddick ended last year ranked No. 14 in
the world and because he earned the first three tournament titles of
his career and because U.S. tennis fans desperately need a winner and
because Sampras and Agassi are getting old, are losing their hair and
gaining families and getting beaten more and more often.</TE>
<TE>   This happened because Roddick wears his baseball cap backward
while he plays tennis and because his game is manic and percussive, a
blur of pounding power from the baseline and service line. Roddick
has the fastest serve of 2002--144 mph at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   In this "SportsCenter" world, where a 10-second clip is what we
see, a 144-mph serve makes the news. But Roddick lost in the third
round and that's not how the new Sampras/Agassi is supposed to
behave.</TE>
<TE>   "My confidence doesn't waver," Roddick says. "I have too much
belief in myself."</TE>
<TE>   He has, at least, a champion's ego, the ability to count on his
talent to make him a champion.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived for the Mercedes-Benz Cup ranked No. 12. After Roddick,
seeded No. 4, beat No. 7 Xavier Malisse, 6-4, 6-4, Friday in the
quarterfinals, his record this year is 39-12.</TE>
<TE>   If you're into comparative statistics, Roddick took 32 events to
win his fifth tournament. Lleyton Hewitt, 21, the No. 1 player in the
world, needed 34 to win five; Agassi, seeded No. 2 seed, needed 35;
Sampras, owner of a record 13 Grand Slam titles, needed 63; Michael
Chang needed 75. Or, how about this? After 100 professional matches,
Roddick had a 73-27 record. Agassi and Chang were 70-30; Sampras was
60-40.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there has been a murmuring sense that somehow Roddick has
become a disappointment already.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's U.S. Open, Roddick lost a tough, tingling
quarterfinal match against eventual champion Hewitt. The battle
lasted five sets and Roddick crumbled after receiving a bad line call
late in the final set.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt has moved on to win Wimbledon and become No. 1. Roddick had
to withdraw from his second-round match at the Australian Open
because of an injured ankle. He was upset by journeyman one-shot
artist Wayne Arthurs in the first round of the French Open and by
plodding Greg Rusedski at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   So in our fast-paced sports world where winners better create
themselves quickly, Roddick has come here as a tennis sophomore who
is being whispered about. He will never win a Slam, some experts say.
He has too much extraneous movement in his groundstrokes. His
footwork is sloppy. He should get rid of his lifelong coach, Tarik
Benhabiles. That's what European media were writing at Wimbledon.
Roddick's game has stagnated, his progress has been halted.</TE>
<TE>   "No way," Roddick says.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick has just finished a fiery hour-long battle against
Malisse, a stylish Belgian who was a Wimbledon semifinalist. Roddick
had finished off the match with a cannon serve and a follow-up
nuclear forehand, the kind that would have knocked a hole in
Malisse's stomach had Malisse been able to locate the ball.</TE>
<TE>   During the match, Roddick had tossed a handful of rackets in anger
and muttered not-so-sweet nothings to himself on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   If he is asked about bearing the burden of being Sampras and
Agassi, of being considered the one and only man right now with
enough talent and pizazz to feed the tour its American pie, Roddick
sounds weary but resigned. "I guess it's not unfair to have those
expectations after last year," he says, "but I think people are being
impatient."</TE>
<TE>   Benhabiles, a Frenchman and a former Tour player, says Roddick
needs time to mature. "There is only one Pete and only one Andre,"
Benhabiles says. "And there is only one Andy. This Andy is part of a
new generation. Don't judge him yet. Give him three, four, five
years."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick says he took it hard, losing to Hewitt in New York last
September. He wasn't happy to have lost his composure over the bad
call. He shrugs off the two lackluster Grand Slam performances this
summer as "just something that happens."</TE>
<TE>   What he should have learned from those disappointments, Benhabiles
says, is, in one word, "preparation."</TE>
<TE>   In today's semifinals, Roddick will meet Jan-Michael Gambill.
Gambill, a handsome blond with a sparkling smile, had the Roddick tag
a couple of years ago. Gambill was going to be the next
Sampras/Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Now Gambill is ranked No. 53. It is where he belongs, where his
talent has taken him.</TE>
<TE>   It's too soon to tell where Roddick belongs or where his talent
will take him. Or leave him.</TE>

<HD>Agassi Knows How It Goes</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He wins quarterfinal against Kuerten that is too
good too soon, just as he thought it would be.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi knew it would be this way.</LD>
<LD>   He predicted a great match. He said it would be colorful. And he
felt it was a shame because it was too early in the tournament for
him to play Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Guess what? It was a hat trick of accurate predictions for Agassi.</LD>
<TE>   The only thing he didn't do was call a winner. But the No.
2-seeded Agassi took care of that himself eventually, in just under
two hours, defeating No. 5 Kuerten, 7-6 (3), 3-6, 6-4, in the
quarterfinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   The packed house of 7,115, which included French Open and
Wimbledon champion Serena Williams, was treated to a riveting
contest. Kuerten had 17 aces to Agassi's 11 and was not broken until
the seventh game of the third set. Agassi broke him at 15 with a
sharp forehand return winner.</TE>
<TE>   Kuerten was about the only one to misfire on an observation. It
turned out he may have seriously underrated himself when he said on
Thursday he felt he had little chance to reach the U.S. Open final.
This was his first hard-court tournament since the Australian Open
and his rustiness hardly showed as his formidable one-handed backhand
sent Agassi scrambling, combining power with deft angles.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi showed his typical resolve in what was a rematch of their
semifinal here last year, also won by Agassi in three sets. The first
set was an indication of the quality of this quarterfinal. Agassi won
it in 43 minutes. In the tiebreaker, he fell behind, 1-3, and did not
lose another point, taking the set by serving and volleying on his
first set point.</TE>
<TE>   "He's amazing," Kuerten said of Agassi. "His intensity on the
court from the first point until the end--he's so intense and
focused. He has so much energy. He could be home. He could be
satisfied. But he is still playing so intensely. He is an
inspiration. When I play him, I want to play like him."</TE>
<TE>   Said Agassi, of the decisive service break: "I hit two forehand
returns, which were just what the doctor ordered. I don't think I
would have slept well if I had gotten no breaks, but Guga can be
effective with his serve when he hits his rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   In today's semifinals, No. 4 Andy Roddick will play Jan-Michael
Gambill. Roddick defeated Wimbledon semifinalist Xavier Malisse of
Belgium, 6-4, 6-4, in the quarterfinals, and Gambill beat Nicolas
Kiefer of Germany, 7-5, 7-6 (5). Gambill won his only previous match
against Roddick last year in San Jose in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   There are three Americans in the semifinals for the third
consecutive year at this tournament, and it is guaranteed that an
American will be in the final for the seventh consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, the defending champion, will face No. 8 Max Mirnyi of
Belarus in the night semifinal. Mirnyi defeated left-hander Michael
Llodra of France, 6-4, 7-6 (4), to reach his third ATP semifinal of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I played pretty well and my movement was a key to the
match," Mirnyi said. "I feel my game is coming along. I would like to
win my first title here, but I have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Llodra kept squandering break-point chances against Mirnyi and
finally capitalized late in the second set, breaking to take a 6-5
lead. He was visibly excited, punching his fist in the air. Mirnyi
promptly broke him at love in the next game, sending the set to a
tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   The French player said he might have mentally moved ahead to the
third set. On the changeover before he served for the second set, he
told his coach to get him some water with electrolytes to prepare for
another set.</TE>
<TE>   "In my head, I'm going to play the third set," he said. "I think
the second set was over and I don't concentrate."</TE>
<TE>   Roddick appeared to have no such problems of faltering
concentration. Instead, he merely got angry with himself against
Malisse, twice tossing his racket. For him, a semifinal result in Los
Angeles is a considerable improvement over his first-round loss here
last year to Marat Safin, but the 19-year-old realizes the
expectations are different for him in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, they didn't want to lose to an 18-year-old that they'd
never really heard of," he said of his colleagues on the tour. "This
year, they're trying to beat a top-15 player. It's a different
scenario. Last year, everything I went to was new for me and it was
new for everybody else seeing me.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, getting to the semis here, it's kind of, 'OK,
whatever.' That's the difference."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras and his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson, are expecting
their first child at the end of the year. It is not anticipated that
Sampras will miss the Australian Open next year.</TE>

<LD>Justin Gimelstob is making a comeback in more ways than one this week
at the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Gimelstob, who played two seasons of college tennis for the
Bruins, has made himself at home in the doubles tournament at L.A.,
where he will make his third consecutive appearance in the semifinals
today.</LD>
<LD>   He and Michael Llodra of France will face cousins Prakash and
Stephen Amritraj tonight after upsetting top-seeded Don Johnson and
Jared Palmer, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7), in Thursday's quarterfinals.</LD>
<TE>   In the victory, Gimelstob and Llodra rallied and then held off
four match points.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exciting, good to beat one of the best doubles team in the
world," Gimelstob said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming back from injuries that have plagued him for the last 2 1/2
years has made it particularly satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Gimelstob said he is finally playing pain-free after being
bothered by a herniated disk in his lower back and strained ligaments
in his left ankle. His bad back has benefited from a yoga regimen
that has given him added strength and flexibility. The ankle also has
been healed by a combination of rest and rehabilitative exercises.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a lot of pain," Gimelstob said. "It was really hard, but
challenging too, and hopefully all the work will start paying off."</TE>

<LD>Top-seeded Venus Williams overcame a feisty performance by Anna
Kournikova to win, 6-3, 6-4, Friday night and advance to the
semifinals of the Bank of the West Classic at Stanford along with
Lindsay Davenport, Kim Clijsters and surprise winner Lisa Raymond.</LD>
<LD>   Williams used her powerful serve, which reached 116 mph early in
the match, to best Kournikova, who had two victories earlier in the
week after a five-match losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   Kournikova broke Williams' serve and took a lead in each set, but
Williams rallied twice for her eighth consecutive victory over the
Russian, who spiked several balls on the court in frustration and
questioned several line calls. Kournikova was undone by a string of
unforced errors in the first set, and she struggled against Williams'
serve late in the second set.</LD>
<TE>   Williams will next play Raymond, who upset No. 3 Monica Seles,
6-4, 6-2. Davenport, seeded No. 2, defeated No. 5 Jelena Dokic of
Yugoslavia, 6-2, 6-2, and Clijsters beat wild card Jelena Jankovic of
Yugoslavia, 7-5, 6-3. Raymond, a doubles specialist, hit serves
reaching 104 mph and rarely made errors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justine Henin of Belgium has withdrawn from next week's Acura
Classic at La Costa because of a broken left ring finger, which she
injured in her first-round match against Marissa Irvin on Wednesday
at Stanford. It was supposed to be the first appearance at La Costa
for the seventh-ranked player in the world. The wild-card entrants at
the event are Mary Pierce of France, Allison Bradshaw, Conchita
Martinez of Spain and Ashley Harkleroad.</TE>
<TE>   If form holds, top-seeded Venus Williams will play No. 5 Clijsters
in the quarterfinals and No. 3 Davenport in the semifinals. In the
other half of the draw are No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, No. 4 Seles and
No. 7 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. Venus Williams is the defending
champion. Martina Navratilova has accepted a spot in doubles field at
Acura and will play with Elena Tartakova of Ukraine.</TE>

<DL>BOURG-EN-BRESSE, France</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong doesn't have a rider threatening to cut into his lead
in the final two stages of the Tour de France.</LD>
<LD>   He likes it that way.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong finished 24th in Friday's 18th stage, 11 minutes 42
seconds behind winner Thor Hushovd. The Texan maintained his 5:06
lead over Joseba Beloki and is a virtual lock to win his fourth
consecutive Tour de France.</LD>
<TE>   After saying Thursday he is sleeping well thanks to his large
lead, Armstrong cruised Friday and wants to augment his lead in
today's individual time trial from Regnie-Durette to Macon.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show the value of the yellow jersey," Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   Hushovd won the 109.4-mile stretch from Cluses to Bourg-en-Bresse
in central France in 4:28.28. He crossed the line just ahead of
Christophe Mengin, credited with the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Hushovd, who rides for Credit Agricole, won his first stage in the
Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   He struggled to finish the second leg earlier this month after a
severe leg cramp. He had to have his leg massaged by the trainer
during the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Australian rider Robbie McEwen finished at the front of the main
pack and moved a point ahead of Germany's Erik Zabel in the standings
for best sprinter.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's final stage from Melun, outside Paris, to the
Champs-Elysees should be little more than a victory lap for the
30-year-old Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Armstrong finished 6:44 ahead of Jan Ullrich of
Germany. He could top that by winning the time trial and completing
what many consider his easiest victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The team has made it easier for me," Armstrong said. "To have
guys always there in multiples, that makes life a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong said Friday that he doesn't care about the French doping
probe of his U.S. Postal Service team anymore, calling it "a joke

<TE>   "Immediately they [French judicial officials] knew the evidence
was clean, but they kept the case open," he said. "It's not an issue
anymore, they can keep it open, there's nothing there."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong has been heckled by fans shouting "Dop-AY! Dop-AY!"
("Doped! Doped!"), but French judicial officials recently said the
investigation into the Postal Service team launched in the fall of
2000 has revealed no evidence of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The probe began after a French TV crew filmed U.S. Postal
officials disposing of medical waste far from the team hotel.</TE>
<TE>   French officials expect the investigation to close by the end of
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old Armstrong has never failed a drug test and denies
taking banned substances. If he wins this year, he plans to try for a
record-tying fifth Tour de France title next year.</TE>

<LD>A Midwestern father who loved midsummer's heat and, worse, humidity,
once suggested that bed pillows had two sides just so overheated
would-be sleepers like his son could turn them over once a night and
have a dry place for their lazy, whining heads.</LD>
<LD>   Willis Carrier wouldn't approve. A hundred years ago this month
Carrier finished inventing conditioned air, not to make anyone more
comfortable but to protect printing paper from the elements in urban
Brooklyn, which didn't invent summer heat but moved it closer to
perfection.</LD>
<LD>   The rest is largely unrecognized history. The reason Maryland
donated the District of Columbia to the United States was not
altruism or because the property was perfect for grandiose granite
buildings and a monument surfeit. The place is a swamp--of at least
the water kind. Without air conditioning, those feuding factions of
politicians and commentators who now populate Washington year-round
would have to evacuate the place for the summer, returning to real
homes to sip lemonade without an expense account. Then how would
cable-TV talk shows find hyperbolic guests to argue preprinted points
in the heat?</LD>
<TE>   Without air conditioning, the desert tow truck business would
wither as motorists zipped up those Mojave hills in windy bliss
without gambling on overheated engines.</TE>
<TE>   Without air conditioning, sweater companies would go bankrupt each
summer because female office workers could survive in blouses and
office windows would do weird things like open. Same for cold
medicine makers; who'd buy their stuff without the chills and
sniffles caused by plunging a sweating body into an indoor Arctic?
Without air conditioning's precise climate controls, our computers
would crash at unpredictable times, losing hours of valuable work and
overheating angry workers.</TE>
<TE>   Without air conditioning, Houston could not have a pro baseball
team. By all rights, St. Louis shouldn't either, but it makes do as
Budweiser's home. Without air conditioning, people would still sit on
their front porches, talking to each other across the hedges. Imagine
that racket! Without air conditioning, there would be no brownouts,
no Stage 3 alerts, no governors in shirt sleeves to show their
devotion to energy conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Without air conditioning, service stations wouldn't get to sell so
much gas to fuel our mobile family refrigeration units. Without air
conditioning, folks in Needles, Barstow, New Orleans and Memphis
might live elsewhere, maybe, heaven forbid, along the Hollywood
Freeway or Interstate 5. So thanks a lot to that Carrier fellow for
his grand invention of air conditioning. It's been a blessing.</TE>

<HD>R.I.P., Auburn Dam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 700-foot-high Auburn Dam on the American River 35 miles northeast
of Sacramento was to be the capstone of the golden age of big federal
water projects that began with Hoover Dam in the 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   Authorized by Congress in 1965, Auburn had a modernist design, an
elegant, thin curved-arch structure that would store the American's
waters and send them via a new canal down the east side of the San
Joaquin Valley to irrigate the row crops and orchards.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-five years ago, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation diverted the
river through a 35-foot-wide tunnel not far downstream from where
gold was discovered in 1848. The water thus flowed around the dam
site, keeping it dry for the construction to follow. Once the dam was
finished, the tunnel would be closed and the dam would begin to fill.</LD>
<TE>   But for a variety of reasons, the dam--always controversial--was
never built. And this fall, the bureau will shut the diversion tunnel
and return the American to its natural channel. The act will restore
seven miles of fine white-water rafting stream and ought to end any
prospect that the dam will be built. R.I.P., Auburn Dam.</TE>
<TE>   It was never economically justified and was authorized by Congress
mostly because it was the pet project of the local congressman, the
late Democratic Rep. Harold T. "Bizz" Johnson of Roseville. The river
should have been restored years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of Auburn will not rest in peace as long as Rep. John
T. Doolittle of Rocklin, a conservative Republican and a successor to
Johnson, remains in Congress. Auburn Dam is Doolittle's passion; he
says it is essential if Sacramento is to be spared a catastrophic
flood one day.</TE>
<TE>   It's Doolittle against everyone else. Other members of Congress in
the region, the Corps of Engineers, the local flood control district
and city, state and county officials all support a $219-million plan
to raise Folsom Dam, just upstream from Sacramento, by 7 feet and to
bolster the American River levee system through Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But if Doolittle can't have Auburn Dam, he won't let Sacramento
have reasonable protection against flooding. He has talked Chairman
Don Young (R-Alaska) of the House Transportation Committee into
blocking the Folsom-levee project. This is a dangerous course.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has repeatedly rejected revival of Auburn Dam, even a
smaller structure to be built solely for flood control. Construction
was halted in 1975 when scientists discovered the proposed dam was on
an active earthquake fault system. This necessitated a redesign of
the dam so that its concrete base would be 400 feet thick, raising
the cost to more than $1 billion. During the delay, opposition
mounted from environmental groups and taxpayer associations. The
project was abandoned in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn Dam from its inception was a white elephant in modernist
disguise, a remnant of a different era. Today we celebrate another
stretch of river that soon will run free.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If a bill just shy of enough support for passage in the state
Legislature becomes law, the folks who peddle cigarettes to kids from
the back of an ice cream truck could get a lucky break.</LD>
<LD>   AB 1666 probably would preempt the efforts of cities like Los
Angeles to crack down on merchants who illegally sell cigarettes to
kids and instead put all the authority to regulate underage tobacco
sales into the hands of the state. On its face that doesn't sound so
sinister. The measure, originally drafted by Sen. Steve Peace (D-El
Cajon), also would raise the state's tobacco tax. The resulting price
increase would be a disincentive to cigarette use.</LD>
<LD>   But consider this: The bill would transfer the power to curb
underage cigarette sales to the state's Bureau of Equalization, a tax
assessment agency, and the Department of Health Services. Neither is
staffed or equipped to monitor the thousands of retail outlets across
the state that sell cigarettes.</LD>
<TE>   State law bars cigarette sales to children under 18. Los Angeles,
like many cities, has put new teeth into enforcement in recent years.
A city ordinance requires merchants who sell tobacco products to
obtain a permit and dispatches undercover inspectors to ensure they
don't sell to children. A telephone hotline, (888) 333-0730, also
yields tips from the public about gas stations and stores near
schools that illegally sell to kids, as well as ice cream trucks,
street-corner sellers who carry their inventory in backpacks and
other mobile vendors. A unit in the city attorney's office goes after
violators. Repeat offenses result in the suspension and even
revocation of city permits.</TE>
<TE>   This approach works because local prosecutors know the city far
better than bureaucrats in Sacramento. But if Peace's bill passes,
the city attorney's unit could be out of business, to be replaced by
who knows what. That may be just what the tobacco industry wants.</TE>
<TE>   Peace's bill has moved with the stealth and deception that are
hallmarks of the industry. Peace originally drafted the bill as a
stand-alone measure, but in recent weeks he amended it into another,
faster-moving bill. The bill could be debated in a weekend session
today, and lawmakers frazzled by the end-of-the-session crush of
bills may not take the time to examine it closely. They should, and
they should vote no.</TE>

<LD>Leaking torpedo propellant caused the explosion that sank the Kursk
nuclear submarine nearly two years ago, killing its 118-man crew, and
no one was to blame, Russia's top prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   Closing the books on the disaster, Prosecutor General Vladimir
Ustinov also defended the Kremlin's handling of the rescue efforts
and confirmed that no evidence was found to back up allegations that
a collision with a Western submarine or a World War II mine was to
blame.</LD>
<LD>   Ustinov said all the sailors aboard died within eight hours of the
Kursk's sinking in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, 2000--long before any
help could arrive.</LD>

<HD>Castro Lauds House Vote</HD>
<DH>Cuba: 'We shall always be grateful' for the move to ease
sanctions, communist leader says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CIEGO DE AVILA, Cuba</DL>
<LD>Proclaiming that friends can be found even among his country's worst
enemies, President Fidel Castro thanked U.S. representatives who
voted this week to ease sanctions against the communist-ruled island.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a rally Friday to mark the start of the Cuban
revolution 49 years ago, the Cuban leader said the House vote passing
the measure was a gesture of such significance that it doesn't matter
if President Bush vetoes the move, as threatened.</LD>
<LD>   "Nor does it matter if new ruses and provocations are invented to
annul them," Castro said in his annual address, attended by tens of
thousands of people.</LD>
<TE>   "I would like to express our people's gratitude to both the
Democratic and Republican legislators who on that day acted
intelligently and strongly, following their own beliefs," Castro told
the crowd gathered in this central provincial capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We shall always be grateful for that gesture."</TE>
<TE>   The House voted Tuesday to lift long-standing restrictions on
travel to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The House also voted to remove hurdles on the sale of food and
medicine to Cuba and lift the caps on money that Cuban Americans can
send to relatives in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The measures have not been passed by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said this week that the president would be urged
to veto the spending bill containing the provisions if it included an
end to the travel ban.</TE>
<TE>   Castro also referred to the strong support many Americans
expressed for the return of Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba
during a seven-month international custody battle that ended in June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, were among the guests
at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in his speech, Castro painted an apocalyptic vision of
what he called impending financial disaster caused by global
capitalism.</TE>

<HD>German Politician Resigns in Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A growing scandal over lobbyist payments to government officials
ensnared one of Germany's most popular and charismatic legislators
Friday, adding to pressure for politicians to fully disclose their
income and perks.</LD>
<LD>   Cem Oezdemir, a naturalized German of Turkish descent who
symbolized successful integration during his eight years as a
lawmaker, is the latest politician tainted by association with
influence peddlers.</LD>
<LD>   Oezdemir, 36, resigned from his seat in the Bundestag, the lower
house of Parliament, and put his already troubled Greens party on
notice that he was withdrawing from his campaign for reelection.</LD>
<TE>   His departure was spurred by the disclosures that he had used
frequent-flier miles accumulated on state business for personal
purposes and had accepted a low-interest loan from the same lobbyist
whose lavish spending put more than $70,000 in the pocket of Rudolf
Scharping, leading to his ouster as defense minister just a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   The departures of Oezdemir and Scharping follow accusations in
recent months that Social Democrats in North Rhine-Westphalia state
had accepted illegal donations, as well as bribery allegations
against conservative Christian Democrats, including former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign for Sept. 22 elections heats up, the governing
coalition led by Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
pushing for broad reform of Germany's vague and limited financial
disclosure guidelines. But the opposition, including Kohl's party and
the liberal Free Democrats, have objected to efforts to expose the
"side income" of public servants as unnecessarily intrusive.</TE>
<TE>   Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse has thrown his authority
behind the push for detailed disclosure, arguing that honest
politicians have nothing to fear.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing fundamentally reprehensible about contact between
politicians and lobbyists," Thierse, who was a Social Democrat but
now is in a nonpartisan role, told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an
interview published Friday. "What is essential is that these
relations are transparent and regulated."</TE>
<TE>   German law requires legislators to disclose payments for public
appearances, speeches and promotional work only when they exceed
$10,000. A clause in the parliamentary code of conduct says lawmakers
should use frequent-flier miles accumulated on government business
for other official trips, but airlines eager to please their official
clientele can keep each customer's records confidential, said Michael
Kirnberger, vice president of a German travel management association.</TE>
<TE>   It is also sometimes unclear what constitutes income that should
be disclosed. Oezdemir ran into trouble for accepting a $40,000 loan
from lobbyist Moritz Hunzinger at about half the interest rate a
borrower would pay a bank. There is no law expressly prohibiting such
an arrangement, but the saved interest is regarded by some as outside
income that must be disclosed and assessed for taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Government ministers are not allowed to accept any income aside
from their annual salaries, which range from $165,000 a year to the
chancellor's $260,000. Bundestag members earn about $80,000 a year,
plus an additional $40,000 for travel and expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of clarity about what should be reported as
income, the German public is becoming increasingly concerned about
secret deals that could make politicians beholden to business
interests or create the appearance of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Scharping scandal, media reports have linked
politicians from all parties to lobbyists, suggesting such sweetheart
deals are relatively common.</TE>
<TE>   Another indication that such perks might be prevalent was the
virtual silence that followed Oezdemir's resignation, which would
probably be exploited by political rivals in an election year unless
they, too, felt vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   The only comments on his departure came from fellow members of the
Greens party, which was already facing an uphill battle to gain seats
in the next Parliament. Greens leader Kerstin Mueller called
Oezdemir's resignation "a loss for the whole Bundestag and especially
for the Greens."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Plans Talks to Unify Iraqi Opposition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has invited key representatives of major
Iraqi opposition groups to a meeting next month with State and
Defense Department officials, seeking to end rivalries in the
campaign to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, officials of the two
departments said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has made clear his intention to seek Hussein's
removal. He said this month that the U.S. would use "all the tools at
our disposal" to accomplish the task.</LD>
<LD>   The effort has been marked by a division in which the Iraqi
National Congress has worked apart from other leading opposition
groups. And the two Cabinet departments have sparred over which
factions of the opposition are the most reliable allies against the
Iraqi president.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting is expected to take place in Washington on Aug. 9.</TE>
<TE>   One Iraqi opposition source, outlining expectations for the
session, said: "We're going to hear that 'the United States is dead
serious about getting rid of Saddam and you have a role but you have
to work together.' "</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials did not dispute that assessment.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department and the Iraqi National Congress, a
London-based opposition umbrella group, have squabbled over the
group's use of U.S. funds to lure defectors and gather intelligence
from Iraq. The department has frozen about $8 million in INC funds
over alleged accounting irregularities.</TE>

<HD>4 Jewish Settlers Are Killed in Roadside Ambush</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian gunmen attack two cars in the West
Bank, injuring four passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Palestinian gunmen killed four Jewish settlers Friday in an ambush of
two cars in the southern West Bank, Israeli authorities said. The
dead included a couple and one of their children.</LD>
<LD>   A militia affiliated with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement reportedly claimed responsibility for the shootings south of
the West Bank city of Hebron. All major militant Palestinian factions
have vowed to avenge Israel's killing this week of 15 Gazans,
including nine children and a Hamas military commander.</LD>
<LD>   The dropping of a 1-ton bomb on a congested Gaza City residential
neighborhood, which achieved its goal of killing the leader of Hamas'
military wing, torpedoed a plan by several Palestinian factions to
declare a cease-fire and suspend attacks after 22 months of
Israeli-Palestinian fighting, according to Palestinian officials and
Western diplomats.</LD>
<TE>   Retaliation began quickly, with the killing Thursday of a rabbi
from a Jewish settlement and then the attack Friday. People on both
sides of the conflict fear a new surge in bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Two or three gunmen opened fire on a white station wagon carrying
a Jewish family en route to the settlement of Maon to spend the
Sabbath, authorities said. The occupants were a settler couple and
their four children, whose names were not immediately released.</TE>
<TE>   The two adults and one child, reported to be about 14, were
killed. The other children--including a 2-year-old--were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen continued firing and hit a second car, killing another
settler and wounding his companion.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities said the gunmen apparently escaped into the
Palestinian village of Yatta, where the army was searching for them
late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the attack, Israel accused the Palestinians of
targeting civilians. "No people can be expected to tolerate this
terror, and Israel will certainly not do so," said a statement from
the office of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Settlers are frequent targets of Palestinian gunmen. Many
militants consider them to be legitimate targets because they live on
land the Palestinians claim as their future state.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the owners of two metalworks factories destroyed by
Israeli forces earlier Friday denied that military equipment was
being fabricated at their businesses and said the destruction would
throw dozens of already destitute Palestinians out of work. The army
said the factories were being used to produce rockets that militants
frequently fire at Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Four Palestinians--a woman and three men--were injured in the raid
and an ensuing firefight.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Israeli troops conducting house-to-house searches
fatally shot a Palestinian man as he stood in his kitchen in the West
Bank town of Kalkilya, according to Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   And in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, several thousand Hamas
supporters marched to demand revenge for their military commander,
Salah Shehada. At the rally, another Hamas leader, Abdulaziz Rantisi,
announced that a replacement for Shehada has already been chosen, but
he refused to identify him. Israel had blamed Shehada for the deaths
of scores of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks and
alleged that he had been planning a massive assault that might have
killed hundreds.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Welcomes N. Korea's Overtures</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Powell says regime's apology to Seoul for a sea
clash and its willingness to receive an envoy are a boon to dialogue
efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIGONELLA, ITALY</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Friday that the Bush
administration's effort to open a dialogue with North Korea may be
back on track as a result of Pyongyang's sudden apology for a naval
clash with South Korea last month, followed by a message to
Washington on Thursday night that it was ready to receive a U.S.
envoy for talks.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of those moves, Powell indicated that he might meet
with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun next week at an ASEAN
conference in Brunei, which would be the communist nation's first
high-level contact with the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   "In the last couple of days, they've made what I consider some
very positive statements that we have welcomed, acknowledging
responsibility for the naval incident that took place a few weeks
back, also once again indicating receptivity to a dialogue with the
United States. We welcome that. We'll be following on it," Powell
told reporters traveling with him to Asia.</LD>
<TE>   The two steps by North Korea took Washington by surprise, because
as recently as Wednesday Pyongyang was still blaming the United
States and South Korea for "gross provocations" that led to a
confrontation in which North Korean naval vessels clashed with South
Korean patrol boats, a senior U.S. official said. At least four South
Koreans were killed, and one of the South's boats sank.</TE>
<TE>   The breakthrough follows a year of efforts by the Bush
administration to reengage the North in talks, which have been
deadlocked since the Clinton administration left office without
formalizing an agreement that would have ended the production and
export of North Korea's ballistic missiles. At an ASEAN summit last
year, Powell had relayed a message that Washington wanted to reopen
talks.</TE>
<TE>   The isolationist regime of leader Kim Jong Il did not respond for
months. In May, it finally said it would receive a U.S. envoy in
Pyongyang, the North's capital, but then in June it did not respond
to a U.S. proposal to send someone in early July. The U.S.
initiative, however, was frozen by the June 29 naval clash.</TE>
<TE>   "Our policy is that we are open to a dialogue. In fact, we stated
that last summer: any time, any place. We were prepared to enter in
that dialogue by now except for the naval incident, which sort of
suggested it was not an appropriate time to send a team to
Pyongyang," Powell told reporters en route to a refueling stop at
Sigonella Naval Air Station in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "So we have had another turn of the wheel, and we'll follow it
up."</TE>
<TE>   Pressed on whether he would meet his North Korean counterpart, he
said, "I'm not ruling anything in or out."</TE>
<TE>   Just a day earlier, U.S. officials had downplayed any possibility
of a meeting at the annual summit of the Assn. of South East Asian
Nations, because North Korea was still taking a belligerent stance.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Kim's regime had warned Wednesday of the danger of
additional confrontations if the U.S. and South Korea prevented North
Korean ships from crossing a disputed maritime border near a fishing
area in the Yellow Sea.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, the letter from North Korean Cabinet official Kim
Ryong Song delivered to South Korea expressed regret for the military
clash, which it called "accidental." It also proposed that both
nations make efforts to avoid future clashes and reopen talks on
reunification and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   If and when the U.S.-North Korean dialogue resumes, the United
States wants to focus largely on ending Pyongyang's programs to
develop weapons of mass destruction, and on redeploying North Korean
conventional forces stationed along the demilitarized zone with South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's decision to add the issue of
conventional forces is one of the reasons the talks launched during
the Clinton presidency have taken so long to resume.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the Clinton administration mediated an agreement with
North Korea to end its nuclear program in Yongbyon in exchange for
U.S., Japanese and South Korean help with two light-water nuclear
reactors for energy.</TE>
<TE>   Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in October 2000
became the first ranking U.S. official to visit North Korea in nearly
half a century, since the 1950-53 Korean War. She mediated terms for
a missile agreement, which President Clinton had hoped to sign as one
of his last foreign policy accomplishments in office. But the effort
stalled over terms for monitoring and verification.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's stop in Brunei is one leg of a grueling eight-nation
swing through Asia beginning with stops in India and Pakistan this
weekend to prod the two nuclear powers to launch new peace efforts in
the disputed Kashmir region.</TE>
<TE>   Although the two South Asian nations pulled back from the nuclear
brink last month, the Bush administration is concerned that another
terrorist attack by Muslim militants against Indian targets could
quickly renew hostilities. The two countries have deployed a million
troops along their border after tensions escalated, beginning with a
Dec. 13 terrorist attack on India's Parliament in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen people died in the attack, including the five gunmen, and
India accused Pakistan's military intelligence agency of complicity.
Pakistan denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he would speak about the urgency of a dialogue between
India and Pakistan so they can avoid getting stuck in an open-ended
state of prewar tensions. But he acknowledged that elections in
Pakistan and Kashmir this fall could prevent any quick response.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will also travel to six southeast Asian nations--Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines--that have
taken on new importance since Sept. 11. The United States says Al
Qaeda members or supporters have operated in five of the six
countries, and Powell will seek to beef up counter-terrorism
cooperation.</TE>

<HD>Russia-Iran Nuclear Plans Will Expand</HD>
<DH>Energy: Moscow's draft of a 10-year program calls for
building two more power plants for the Mideast nation despite U.S.
opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Despite opposition from the United States, Russia is seeking to
increase cooperation with Iran, releasing plans Friday to build a new
nuclear power plant in the western part of that country.</LD>
<LD>   A draft of a 10-year program of cooperation with Iran, which was
approved by the Russian government, spelled out Moscow's
determination to build a plant in Ahvaz in addition to completing a
station under construction in Bushehr, which the U.S. strongly
opposes. The Russians also intend to build a second nuclear plant in
Bushehr, a southern Iranian city about 240 miles southeast of Ahvaz.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for the Russians to supply six nuclear reactors,
four in Bushehr and two in Ahvaz.</LD>
<TE>   The draft, published Friday by the government information
department, also spells out cooperation in the fields of energy,
industry, science, technology and trade, including plans for Caspian
Sea exploration, a pipeline from Iran to India and an aviation joint
venture making Russian Tu-204 and Tu-334 passenger jets.</TE>
<TE>   Details in the 12-page document were agreed upon by Russian and
Iranian officials. No deal on further reactors has yet been signed
with Iran, but release of the plan came unexpectedly and will likely
create alarm in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is against all Russian nuclear sales to Iran, fearing
that this could help Iran develop nuclear weapons. President Bush has
termed the Middle Eastern nation part of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen these reports, and we are looking into them," said
State Department spokesman Frederick Jones. "In the past, we have
made clear to the highest levels of the Russian government that
selling sensitive technology to Iran could prove a serious threat to
the national security interests of the United States, its allies and
friends in the region."</TE>
<TE>   In congressional testimony this month, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell said that the issue of nuclear aid to Iran would be at the top
of his agenda when he and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld meet
with their Russian counterparts in September.</TE>
<TE>   John Tedstrom, a National Security Council aide in the Clinton
administration, said a Russian move to build a second nuclear
facility "would play into the hands of the far right in the Bush
administration who are already skeptical that Russia can be a partner
in the war on terrorism" or other aspects of foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's nuclear sales to Iran remain one of the sorest points in
a relationship with Washington that has improved sharply since
President Vladimir V. Putin backed the U.S. anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Under Putin, Russia has insisted on its right to export civilian
nuclear technology to Iran. The Russian president plans to visit Iran
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the plan came a day after Deputy Defense Minister
Mikhail Dmitriyev affirmed that Russia would sell conventional
defensive weapons to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Moscow promised to limit its nuclear cooperation with
Tehran to the construction of the Bushehr plant, but U.S. officials
are concerned that Russia is offering to help Iran in other sensitive
areas that could enable it to develop nuclear weapons. The CIA has
accused Russia of helping Iran develop long-range ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has repeatedly denied these charges, arguing that nothing
it was doing would help Iran develop a nuclear bomb and that Iran's
nuclear energy projects are internationally monitored. Moscow insists
that Iran will return the spent fuel from the reactors to Russia, so
the Iranians would not have the materials to make a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's eagerness to build three more reactors at Bushehr is not
unexpected, but its willingness to build a nuclear power plant at
Ahvaz, involving two reactors, has not been made public before.</TE>
<TE>   Quizzed by Interfax news service about the issue, Atomic Energy
Ministry spokesman Nikolai Shingarov confirmed that Russia would
offer to build four reactors at Bushehr, but he refused to comment
about the Ahvaz plan. The Atomic Energy Ministry could not be reached
directly for comment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow recently cautioned Russia about
countries such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea, which he said were
actively seeking to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, Russia has to avoid letting its desire for
commercial gain end up hastening the day that these countries can
pose a real weapons of mass destruction threat--a threat that could
not only destabilize their own region but undermine the security of
the entire world," Vershbow said Monday in a speech at the Moscow
School of Political Studies.</TE>
<TE>   In a paper on Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, Robert Einhorn, a senior advisor at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, warned
recently that Iran was working to establish a nuclear weapons program
invulnerable to international pressure or supply problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Within the next few years Iran could reach the point of no
return, a point after which it could succeed in achieving nuclear and
long-range missile capabilities without further foreign assistance,"
he argued in the paper, which was written jointly with Gary Samore, a
senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Einhorn said in an interview that he believed the U.S. was not
aware of plans for Russia to build any reactors beyond Bushehr.</TE>
<TE>   He said the U.S. was most concerned about the transfer of
sensitive fuel cycle technologies to Iran. The U.S. is alarmed that
these technologies, which include light-water research reactors, fuel
fabrication facilities and a uranium-enrichment centrifuge plant,
could enable Iran to produce highly enriched uranium.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov on Wednesday ordered
government departments to negotiate with Iran to finalize the plans
spelled out in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the International Affairs Committee of
the State Duma, or lower house of Russia's parliament, said
maintaining good relations with the U.S. was the one of the most
important planks of Russian foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain lines that Russia won't cross in its
cooperation with countries like Iran," he said.</TE>

<HD>Suharto's Son Convicted in Murder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The playboy son of former dictator Suharto was convicted Friday of
ordering the murder of a Supreme Court justice and was sentenced to
15 years in prison in a case that symbolizes Indonesia's struggle to
rein in judicial corruption and the abuses that defined the Suharto
era.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates for judicial reform hope the ruling will put other
former Suharto cronies on notice--and possibly signal a more honest
approach to ensuring justice in a country widely seen as among Asia's
most corrupt.</LD>
<LD>   Still, some Indonesians scoffed at the sentence for Hutomo Mandala
Putra, better known simply as Tommy, saying the 40-year-old tycoon
got off easy. His conviction for murder, illegal weapons possession
and fleeing justice could have brought a death sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Critics note that the two men convicted of shooting Supreme Court
Justice Syaifudin Kartasasmita received life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts very much," said Kartasasmita's widow, Iwah Setyawati.
"This sentence is not enough. I have lost my husband. I have lost
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Iwah testified during the trial that Tommy attempted to bribe her
husband, who had sentenced him to 18 months in prison in a September
2000 graft case.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict was delivered during a 10-hour proceeding that
was most notable for the defendant's absence from the courtroom. His
lawyers tried unsuccessfully to postpone the verdict, saying it was
unfair to proceed because their client was sick and unable to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors examined Tommy and confirmed that he had a stomachache. A
packed courtroom burst into applause when presiding Judge Amiruddin
Zakaria rejected the defense request for a delay and began reading
the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy has one week in which to appeal, which is considered likely.</TE>
<TE>   Kartasasmita was shot by two hit men on a motorcycle a year ago
Friday. The court said that Tommy paid $11,000 to the two men to kill
the judge and that the handgun used belonged to Tommy.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was arrested on Nov. 28, 2001--after more than a
year on the run after his graft conviction--Tommy had come to
symbolize the excesses committed by Indonesia's ruling class during
his father's reign, which ended in 1998 amid widespread pro-democracy
demonstrations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Finally Cleaning Up Its Act," editorial, July 20: In commending
the Orange County Sanitation District, The Times states: "Now that
water quality agencies are imposing strict rules on urban runoff,
city officials in most of Southern California already are talking of
'not needed' and 'too expensive.' "</LD>
<LD>   Not needed? On the contrary, cities throughout Southern California
support strict guidelines to improve storm runoff and drainage
systems and are fully committed to cleaning up the region's storm
drains. But we need regulations that have a reasonable chance of
succeeding. Similar plans in Orange and San Diego counties have
failed. Why? Because it's unfair to force cities to penalize
residents for washing their cars in the driveway or local businesses
for hosing bird droppings from their sidewalks. And who will cite the
child who drops a candy wrapper into the storm drain?</LD>
<TE>   Too expensive? You bet. The L.A. regional water board failed to
conduct a cost-benefit analysis to tell if these regulations will
deliver results. A state-commissioned study sets the costs for new
regulations at $54 billion over 20 years and almost $200 million in
annual operating costs. The L.A. board's plan is based on flimsy
science, where a single test site determined the guidelines for all
communities. As a result, city budgets will be devastated. Thousands
of Californians will lose jobs. Businesses will incur significant new
costs. And for what? Even the L.A. board staff concedes that its
rules will not be effective.</TE>
<TE>   Is there a better way? Yes. A watershed approach to storm water
management would deliver measurable results based on sound science
and water engineering, and at a reasonable taxpayer expense.</TE>

<LD>Yes, there should be a firing of the head of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("Use the Presidential Broom," editorial, July
23). The problem is how to make it retroactive to 1994 and include
the secretary of the Treasury. As each day goes by and new
revelations pop to the surface exposing the greed, questionable
accounting tactics and outright fraud that took place within
corporate America during the boom years of the 1990s, it is difficult
to believe that someone in either the SEC or Treasury did not at
least suspect that something may have been wrong in the business
world. Was no action taken because of incompetence or was it due to a
desire to not "burst the bubble"?</LD>

<LD>"The Electronic Pillory" (Opinion, July 21) points out that the
desperate savaging by e-mail of Hillary Clinton is reminiscent of the
personal attacks on that great lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, during and
after her husband's presidency. Unfortunately today, too many
e-mailers obligingly forward this patently false claptrap without
ever questioning the background of the source--if, in fact, a source
is provided.</LD>
<LD>   A visit to the public library is "outside the box" for such true
believers. What used to be "If the Bible says it, that's good enough
for me" is now "If it's on e-mail, it must be true." Thank you, Carol

<HD>2 Brothers Are Held in Deaths of 4 Relatives</HD>
<DH>Fire: One suspect owns motel next to inn of a victim,
fatally burned with her son, daughter and mother-in-law at their
home.</DH>

<LD>Two brothers have been arrested on suspicion of murder, bringing to
three the number of suspects in custody in the killings of four
members of a Hollywood Hills family.</LD>
<LD>   Pravin Govin, 33, whom his employees described as a motel owner,
and his brother Victor, 35, were arrested late Thursday night in
connection with the deaths of an owner of a neighboring motel, her
son, daughter and mother-in-law.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers were being held on four counts of murder in
connection with the May 4 deaths at a Lakeridge Drive home, which
authorities said was intentionally set on fire, according to Lt.
Horace Frank of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Pravin Govin was detained about 10:30 p.m. in South Gate and his
brother was taken into custody 45 minutes later in North Hollywood,
Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Another man, Carlos Amador, 26, of Los Angeles, was booked early
Thursday on four counts of murder and one count of arson.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, LAPD detectives declined to reveal a possible motive
for the killings of Gita Kumar, 43; her son, Paras, 18; her daughter,
Tulsi, 16; and her mother-in law, Sitaben Patel.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't going to talk about the motive and [the suspects']
relationship to the Kumars until the case is presented to the
district attorney's office on Monday," said Lt. Don Hartwell.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the investigation, however, said the
killings stemmed from "a land dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Gita Kumar, along with her husband, Harish "Harry" Kumar, owned
several motels, including the Universal City Inn in the 10700 block
of Ventura Boulevard. The Studio Place Inn, a motel that employees
said--and public records show--is owned by Pravin Govin, sits next to
the Kumars' property.</TE>
<TE>   A front desk supervisor at the Studio Place Inn, Kazi Nahid, 34,
said "the police took away" his boss and the boss' brother Thursday
night. "I can't think they could do something like that," said Nahid,
who has worked for Govin for a year, referring to the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Gita Kumar, according to city Planning Department records, filed
an application in 2001 for variances that would allow her and her
husband to tear down the existing 40-unit Universal City Inn and
build a 65-unit, three-story motel with 69 parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing for a conditional use permit on the project and other
variances was first scheduled for May 10 and then postponed to later
this month.</TE>
<TE>   On May 4, Harish Kumar returned home shortly after 11 p.m. to
discover his bungalow ablaze. His wife, son, daughter and mother were
dead inside.</TE>
<TE>   Fire investigators quickly identified the blaze as arson after
finding traces of a flammable liquid in more than one location in the
house. The blaze, they said, had begun in two bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were found in one room of the house and were so badly
burned that dental records were required to identify them.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo Refreshes Its Palette</HD>
<DH>Culture: An influx of artists and affluent buyers is
creating a burgeoning market. The city introduces its first ArtWalk
today in the Old Town area.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Camarillo is hardly a hot spot in Ventura County's art scene, but
things are definitely heating up.</LD>
<LD>   Motivated by what they see as the city's untapped potential,
artists and collectors are opening two galleries this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Successful shows at the 3-year-old gallery at Cal State Channel
Islands have pumped life into the art community.</LD>
<TE>   And today, the Old Town Assn. and Chamber of Commerce are holding
the city's first ArtWalk from 3 to 8 p.m. While Camarillo has not yet
achieved the notoriety of such art communities as Ventura and Ojai,
the activity shows promise for the city's artists.</TE>
<TE>   "The art community in Camarillo is small, but it is growing and
getting better," said Phyllis J. Doyon, a Camarillo watercolor
artist. "I'm very excited about the future." Doyon painted and taught
students at her studio on the north end of town for 15 years before
opening a 2,600-square-foot multi-artist studio and gallery in an
industrial area two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For 27 years, the tiny Camarillo Art Center was the city's main
exhibit space.</TE>
<TE>   The Ponderosa Drive building has hosted many demonstrations,
classes and exhibits, including a Ventura County Pastel Artists Assn.
show opening today. But not enough people know it exists, said Anita
McDermott, the association's president.</TE>
<TE>   Roxie Ray-Bordelon, an expressionist painter living in Camarillo
since 1986, said a growing local market for art has prompted the
city's artists to organize and push their work.</TE>
<TE>   Ray-Bordelon and Doyon attribute the growing market, in part, to
an influx of affluent people with disposable income to spend on art.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo's biggest artistic coup came when Studio Channel Islands
Art Center opened in a 22,000-square-foot space at the budding
university.</TE>
<TE>   Response to the gallery's shows, which have featured artists from
Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo, has been incredible, said
Ray-Bordelon, a board member and one of the founding artists.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, more than 600 people came to see the paintings of
Michael Dvortcsak of Ojai and Laura Rasey Miller of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Ray-Bordelon said the studio has become a hub for county artists,
providing them with mentors and referrals.</TE>
<TE>   The studio also has reached out to city groups, arranging for its
resident artists to display their works at the Camarillo Art Center
and the Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   James Waterbury opened a gallery on Ventura Boulevard two years
ago. His success there, as well as that of Studio Channel Islands,
prompted him to move to a 3,200-square-foot building, four times the
size of his old space.</TE>
<TE>   The grand opening of the James Waterbury Gallery will be held
today in conjunction with the ArtWalk.</TE>
<TE>   Waterbury of Camarillo said the upscale renovations in progress in
Old Town and the full-fledged opening next month of Cal State Channel
Islands, with its art-buying college professors and parents, should
provide more customers.</TE>
<TE>   A group of 30 artists, including painter Ray Ayers of Camarillo,
plans to open another gallery near Waterbury's shop next month.</TE>
<TE>   One of the organizers, Janice Wong, said it will likely be called
Artists' Gallery off the Boulevard. In a preview of what is to come,
many of the artists will display their works at Advantage Graphics &amp;
Printing during the ArtWalk.</TE>
<TE>   Kathlean Butcher, chairwoman of the Old Town Assn., said ArtWalk
organizers were overwhelmed by how many artists jumped at the chance
to participate. More than 50 artists will exhibit their work at 18
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   One of the eager artists was Teri Peterson of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a wonderful idea," said Peterson, who will
display her floral watercolors at Citron Garden, a home decorating
store. "I was excited that art had come to that level here that an
organization would get people together to have this happen."</TE>

<HD>Did System Fail to Protect Samantha?</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jurors acquitted Alejandro Avila in an earlier
molestation case, and the slain girl's mother blames them.
Prosecutors disagree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury had just come back with not-guilty verdicts on three
molestation charges against Alejandro Avila. Before releasing him,
Riverside County Superior Court Judge Robert G. Spitzer offered the
defendant some advice.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a reason that these charges were brought against you,
and the jury could have come to a different decision" over whether
Avila molested two 9-year-old girls in early 1999, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "You want to avoid situations in the future which could result in
the making of such accusations.... You should be grateful to your
defense team for the work that they put in, and change your lifestyle
to avoid these kind of accusations in the future."</LD>
<TE>   That was Jan. 5, 2001. Today Avila is back in custody, accused of
kidnapping, sexually assaulting and murdering 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion in a case that horrified the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they are confident they have the right man. But
they have yet to present any evidence, and Avila, in an interview
with The Times before his arrest last week, insisted that he is
innocent--in fact, that he was nowhere near the scene of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier case against him, however, has become the focus of a
national debate: Did the justice system fail to save Samantha?</TE>
<TE>   "We ordered the case up from our archives" right after Avila's
arrest July 19, Riverside County Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Soccio
said. "I wanted to make sure on a personal level ... anticipating
those questions: 'Could we have done more?' "</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dickerson, the deputy district attorney who tried the case,
"is in a lot of personal pain over this," Soccio said. "I don't think
anything could be worse for a prosecutor than to have this happen."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Soccio concluded that his prosecutors--who last year
won convictions in 98% of their child-abuse cases--did their best.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say the system failed," Soccio said with a sigh. "But
I do think that sometimes jurors reach conclusions that don't
accurately reflect what actually occurred.... I guess you have to ask
those jurors what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Erin Runnion, Samantha's mother, put it in harsher terms Thursday
night in a nationally televised interview with Larry King on CNN: "I
blame every juror who let him go, every juror who sat on that trial
and believed this man over those little girls."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors could not be reached because their names are not kept in
the public court file. But a review of hundreds of pages of trial
transcripts suggests they were persuaded by Temecula defense attorney
John Pozza, who focused on Avila's repeated denials, a lack of
physical evidence, and allegations that the children simply weren't
believable.</TE>
<TE>   Pozza did not return telephone calls seeking comment. But in his
closing arguments, he told jurors the evidence wasn't there. "It's
very easy to get caught up in the fact that a young girl is saying
these things," Pozza told jurors, "saying stuff that is horrible,
that is outrageous--[that] this guy is a monster. But you have to
look at the specific little things that come out ... Was she coached?
Has she been exposed to something else? We don't know. But certainly
that should lead to some doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very important," he concluded. "You've been given one of
the greatest powers that a group of people can have, and that is to
determine the outcome and life of a fellow citizen."</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the case rested on the testimony of Elizabeth Coker's
daughter. Coker dated Avila from 1996 to 1999. During the last three
months of the relationship, from January to March, the girl told
jurors, Avila began molesting her on weekends, when her mother, a
school custodian who worked evenings, was away.</TE>
<TE>   "When my mom went to work, he would take me into the room and he
would do those things to me," the girl testified.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, he would order her to take off her clothes. Then he
would remove his own clothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he would start touching me and then making his private part
touch mine," the girl said.</TE>
<TE>   The molestation would continue for over two hours at a time, she
said, in the only bedroom of the tiny Lake Elsinore apartment her
mother shared with Avila. All the while, the girl's two older
brothers sat just beyond the closed bedroom door watching television
or playing video games, unaware of what was happening, the girl
testified.</TE>
<TE>   She rarely struggled, the girl said, because if she did he would
"put his hand over my mouth and jerk me and say, 'Don't go. Don't
move.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared and I was just hoping it would be over soon," she
told jurors.</TE>
<TE>   The girl gave a number of other detailed allegations, including
the recollection that, on occasion, he made her watch pornographic
films.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, she said, she didn't tell her brothers or mother what
happened, intimidated by a threat Avila made to her: "One time he
threatened me and he said, 'I would kill your mom or hurt your
family.' And that time I believed him."</TE>
<TE>   A cousin, also 9, took the stand after Coker's daughter to report
a similar story, describing times when Avila would molest her while
he was baby-sitting for her mother. The cousin also said she was
afraid to tell because Avila told her it was "our secret, don't
tell," the girl testified.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until several months after Coker broke up with Avila
that the daughter decided to tell her mother, spurred by a school
friend who confided that she had been sexually abused by an uncle.
That uncle, the friend told her, later went to jail. So in December
1999, she told.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you wait so long to say anything?" Dickerson asked her.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I was scared still ... because he lived in the same area
as my mom," she said. "But after I told my mom I got a little over
it."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Coker then called police. Later, at the trial, she
testified that Avila always treated her daughter with more affection
than her sons. But she never suspected.</TE>
<TE>   "I trusted him," a distraught Coker testified. "I thought that he
was my fiance, I was going to marry him, and I thought he would be
all right watching the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Avila did not testify on his own behalf in the case, instead
relying on taped interviews with detectives that prosecutors played
for jurors. In the tapes, Avila repeatedly denied touching the girls
in any sexual way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a sexual person," Avila told authorities. "I'm not that
kind of guy."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he said, he did touch his girlfriend's daughter in sensitive
areas about a dozen times, but it was only because he often bathed
her. As for the girl's cousin, he did recall slathering lotion on a
sunburn, but, again, not in a sexual way.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors were never told that Avila failed a polygraph exam. The
judge barred the test as evidence. They were told, however, of
Avila's reaction when a detective came to the Lake Elsinore office of
Professional Hospital Supply, where he was a van driver. He ran out
of a side door, but was later apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   During closing arguments, the defense attorney pleaded with the
jurors to give Avila the benefit of the doubt. "Throughout the
interrogation, he says, 'I have no sexual intent,' " Pozza said.
"He's adamant about that."</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney argued that Coker's daughter was telling the
tale because she heard a similar story from her friend, the one whose
uncle went to jail for molestation. He hammered away at the lack of
physical evidence, which prosecutors say resulted from the lapse of
time since the alleged incidents and because the girls were not
penetrated.</TE>
<TE>   He attacked other inconsistencies in the girls' testimony, like
the time Avila invited Coker's daughter to spend the night with him,
even though the couple had broken up. The girl said she didn't want
to go, but ultimately agreed to visit for a few hours. Pozza also
argued it was implausible that the molestation could have occurred
without anybody suspecting it.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Pozza focused on the prosecution's failure to call as
witnesses several people who might have corroborated the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors told prosecutors after their verdict that they went into
the jury room confident they would convict but in the end decided
there was a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Soccio said his office is proud of Dickerson's efforts, despite
the outcome and the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul was a pit bull," he said. "He did everything he could ... We
let him know he worked hard, he put on a good trial, and a jury made
the decision to let Mr. Avila go, not Mr. Dickerson.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think the responsibility here has to come back to something
else," Soccio said. "It wasn't the jury's fault. It wasn't Mr.
Dickerson's fault. It's Avila's fault."</TE>

<HD>The Book on Black Church Leaders</HD>
<DH>History: An ambitious new work examines the religious
struggles and contributions of African Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BRIGGS</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>There were slaves who led bloody uprisings and former slaves who
endured whippings to preach the gospel. There were nationalists who
argued that blacks could be free only in a nation of their own and
those who suffered in nonviolent protest to change America.</LD>
<LD>   Like their biblical ancestors, black Christian leaders in America
have struggled to keep their faith amid an often-hostile culture.</LD>
<LD>   In a new book exploring key figures in the black church's history,
the Rev. Marvin McMickle celebrates the diversity of a community of
faith born in slavery and passionately engaged for the rest of its
history in a modern-day Exodus.</LD>
<TE>   The book reveals the hope--shared across three centuries--that the
black church can dramatically change American life.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think any other community tends to value its
religious institutions like the African American community does,"
says McMickle, pastor of Cleveland's Antioch Baptist Church.</TE>
<TE>   His "An Encyclopedia of African American Christian Heritage,"
published by Valley Forge, Pa.-based Judson Press, examines the lives
of the preachers, prophets, politicians, nationalists, singers and
scholars who have shaped black Christian life.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary figures in the encyclopedia include T.D. Jakes, an
electrifying, best-selling preacher; Kirk Franklin, a Grammy-winning
contemporary gospel singer; James Cone, one of a number of scholars
developing a black theology relevant to the African American
experience; the Rev. Vashti McKenzie, elected in 2000 as the first
woman bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church; and the Revs.
Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.</TE>
<TE>   But these modern-day figures build upon a legacy left by leaders
who shared the struggle of living as a black Christian in America.</TE>
<TE>   During the time of slavery, leaders such as Nat Turner gave their
lives in violent protest, while black preachers such as Andrew Bryan
endured public whippings in a nonviolent response to whites who
feared slaves organized for worship could later organize for
rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   It was a tension between working through the system and civil
disobedience that can be found throughout black religious history,
McMickle argues.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Turner started the bloodiest slave uprising in
American history, acting on what he believed was a sign from God to
lead nearly 70 slaves in the killing of 53 white people in August
1831.</TE>
<TE>   With the permission of his owner, George Liele organized the first
black Baptist church in the United States in the 1770s on the
plantation where he was a slave. Later, Alexander Crummell and Marcus
Garvey despaired in the 19th and 20th centuries that black Americans
would never be equal citizens and advocated leaving to build nations
of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Charles Harrison Mason founded the Church of God in
Christ, an interracial Pentecostal denomination with more than 300
white ministers before social pressures in the early 20th century
forced it to split into black and white groups.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. challenged the
status quo with a nonviolent protest movement that fundamentally
changed a nation.</TE>
<TE>   McMickle says one of the greatest contributions by the black
church to the Christian world is a tradition of powerful preaching.
That tradition, he says, continues today with such people as Jakes
and Cleveland's Rev. Otis Moss Jr. In an earlier day, God brought
forth Billy Graham to be a national voice for evangelical
Christianity, said Bishop J. Delano Ellis II, president of the United
Pentecostal Churches of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Ellis says, God is lifting up people such as Jakes and other
black preachers who are reaching the nation in their television
ministries and books.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a new way and a new movement," Ellis said. "I believe it
will be the black bishop, the black preacher, the black clergy,
that's going to set the Christian church back in order."</TE>

<HD>Vigil for Brothers Burned in Crash</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Friends plan weekend of fund-raisers to help
family pay medical expenses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Victor and Felipe Velez laid in the same hospital room Friday, both
severely burned and in extremely critical condition after a car crash
last Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The teenage brothers were driving to a soccer match on the Pomona
Freeway when a Ford Mustang racing another car hit the side of their
truck, flipping it onto its roof and trapping the pair inside,
according to authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The Velezes' truck caught fire. Bystanders yanked the boys from
the cab, taking hold of what was left of their blue-and-white
uniforms.</LD>
<TE>   Family and friends in their Long Beach neighborhood have spent the
last week dealing with the difficult status reports: Felipe's
condition is improving; Victor's is not.</TE>
<TE>   Both are burned on more than 65% of their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, friends organized a weekend of car washes and door-to-door
fund-raising, hoping to help the family pay medical expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, their father's health worsened and he stopped working.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother supports the family by working as a housekeeper.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested two men allegedly racing their cars and
charged them with causing injuries while involved in a "speed race."</TE>
<TE>   Omar Quito, 22, and Jose Antonio Vasquez, 19, posted bail but
could be charged with vehicular manslaughter if either brother dies.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Victor, 19, and Felipe, 16, planned to travel with
their father to Guadalajara so they could try out for a Mexican
soccer league team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was their dream to be soccer players," said Sandra Velez, 23.
"To be famous."</TE>
<TE>   The family moved to the U.S. from Guadalajara about eight years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe's parents both worked to provide for their six
children--four girls and two boys.</TE>
<TE>   Without fail, they bought Victor's and Felipe's soccer shoes,
Sandra Velez said.</TE>
<TE>   Once they had their professional careers, Felipe and Victor wanted
to treat their mom "como una princesa," Sandra Velez said.</TE>
<TE>   Both were known for wearing soccer jerseys to school.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe, who will enter 11th grade in the fall, would walk into his
sixth-period history class and entertain classmates Michelle Magana
and Diana Gonzalez with talk about soccer, they said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the pair had little interest, but by year's end,
Felipe's soccer passion proved infectious.</TE>
<TE>   "Felipe made us [care]," Magana said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Declares Suspect in Samantha Case 'the Killer'</HD>
<DH>Crime: The president's comment comes during a speech on

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush left no doubt Friday that he considers Alejandro Avila
guilty of murdering Samantha Runnion, referring to the arrested
suspect as "the killer."</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's comments earned a strong rebuke from Avila's attorney,
who chastised the president for judging her client before he has had
his day in court.</LD>
<LD>   "President Bush has proclaimed Mr. Avila guilty on the basis of
nothing more than law enforcement statements," said Denise Gragg,
Orange County deputy public defender. "If he used the same method to
determine the guilt or innocence of those men and women who were
executed under his watch in Texas, it's easy to understand how
innocent people get executed."</LD>
<TE>   Avila has been charged with kidnapping, sexually assaulting and
murdering Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Avila said in an interview with The Times that he had nothing to
do with the crime and was at an Ontario mall at the time of the
kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Gragg, who has represented defendants in some of Orange County's
most sensational murder trials, said she has declined numerous media
requests to discuss the Avila case, but broke her silence because she
was outraged by Bush's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Avila was arrested July 19 and hasn't yet entered a plea in Orange
County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The president volunteered his view during a speech on homeland
security before an audience of lawmakers, fire and rescue workers,
police officers, and other state and local officials.</TE>
<TE>   Among those in attendance was Orange County Sheriff Michael S.
Carona.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening comments, Bush mentioned Carona while singling out
various public officials gathered in an auditorium in the Eisenhower
Executive Office Building next to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to acknowledge Mike Carona of Orange County, California,
who's with us to share--Where are you, Mike? There you are, Mike.
Looking right at you," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate you coming," the president added, telling the crowd:</TE>
<TE>   "He represents the local officials, what we call in Texas the high
sheriffs ... He's the fellow who recently apprehended the killer of
Samantha Runnion there in California. I want to congratulate you for
your good work, helping make your community as safe as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments are reminiscent of similar remarks made in the
1970s by President Nixon, who pronounced Charles Manson guilty in the
middle of Manson's trial for the murders of actress Sharon Tate and
four others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's officials named the department's command
center--used for the first time during the recent murder
investigation--after the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   The two trailers that make up the center were officially named
"Samantha 1" and "Samantha 2" at a small dedication ceremony attended
by the girl's mother and stepfather Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the investigation, the trailers housed dozens of
telephone operators who fielded more than 1,000 tips as the public
scrambled to help detectives identify Samantha's killer.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities received several tips from the public suggesting that
they check out Avila, a 27-year-old Lake Elsinore man. Police sources
said DNA found on Samantha's body matches a DNA sample taken from
Avila.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Martyrs to Be Beatified</HD>
<DH>Catholics: The two, killed by idol worshipers in 1700, will
be recognized by Pope John Paul II. The event will culminate decades
of effort by believers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CAJONOS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>When Pope John Paul II travels to Mexico City next week, he will
canonize Juan Diego, making a saint of the Mexican peasant to whom
Catholics believe the Virgin of Guadalupe first appeared in 1531.</LD>
<LD>   An enormous crowd is expected to fill blocks around the city's
basilica Wednesday for what should be one of the biggest religious
spectacles that Mexico has ever seen.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to these festivities, however, a less well-known
appointment is on the papal schedule for the next day. This is a
beatification of the so-called "Martyrs of Cajonos," Juan Bautista
and Jacinto de Los Angeles, who were killed for their faith Sept. 16,
1700.</LD>
<TE>   A proud contingent of citizens from Cajonos, a village in the
Mexican state of Oaxaca, as well as immigrants from Oaxaca who live
in Los Angeles County, will participate in the ceremony, also at the
basilica. They will carry flowers, portraits of Bautista and De Los
Angeles, and glass cases decorated with gold fringe that hold the
martyrs' bones.</TE>
<TE>   The story of these two men--risen from obscurity after 300
years--opens a window into Mexican history as well as the Vatican's
modern evangelistic strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's subjugation of Mexico was achieved mainly through
Catholicism. Soon after conquistador Hernando Cortes prevailed in
1521, Catholic friars, priests and nuns were on ships sailing toward
what was soon called New Spain.</TE>
<TE>   They built fortress-like convents, and from these high walls set
forth to convert and--to their way of thinking--civilize the
indigenous population.</TE>
<TE>   To help in this massive task, early adherents to Catholicism were
deputized as fiscales, or marshals, and allowed to bear arms. The
fiscales--Bautista and de Los Angeles among them--were expected to
uphold civil and religious laws.</TE>
<TE>   One day, those two encountered a group of their fellow citizens in
Cajonos who were worshipping idols. Experts hypothesize that it may
have been a celebration of Huitzilopochtli, the harvest god. Bautista
and De Los Angeles reported what they had seen to the religious
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, those who had been informed on dragged the fiscales off
into the densely wooded mountain highlands and killed them with
machetes. They were buried there in unmarked graves near the town of
San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   In their youth, this gruesome tale was told often to Gilberto
Hernandez, now 73; Pablo Belasco, 69; and Desiderio Robles, 76. They
all live in Cajonos, nearly 10,000 feet above sea level and a
two-hour ride over muddy roads from the city of Oaxaca. Cajonos
(population 350) is known locally as un pueblo de las nubes, or a
"town in the clouds." A basketball court built on a cracked concrete
slab doubles as the town square.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, Belasco and Robles are subsistence farmers who grow
maize and chickpeas. Sitting in the shady courtyard of their
village's church, the three men spoke recently with visitors.
Politely removing their hats and placing them with dignity on their
knees, they spoke to each other in the flat-toned syllables of their
native Zapotec language before replying in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "Our grandparents would tell us about the martyrs, just like they
told stories from the revolution," Belasco said. "We learned that
they died defending the Catholic faith," Robles agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "And that lilies grew out of their graves, and their names were
written on each leaf," Hernandez added, though his tone of voice
indicated that this last detail could not be verified.</TE>
<TE>   This all might have remained local folklore had not Hernandez come
across a book in Cajonos' town hall titled "Historical Points."
Published in 1889 and written by Eulogio G. Gillow, who was then
bishop of Oaxaca, it deals with the lives and deaths of Bautista and
De Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After reading it, Hernandez and the others thought they had been
called to approach the Vatican with a case for beatification, which
is the first and hardest step toward possibly being named a saint.</TE>
<TE>   Coached by their priest in 1973, they started interviewing the
town elders. They collected detailed files on the more than 30 people
who insisted that their prayers to the martyrs had resulted in
miracles. To their surprise, though, the men learned that such claims
are not required for martyrs because the Catholic Church considers
that giving one's life alone is verification of sanctity.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, their decades-long effort would outlast the tenure of
various priests who helped them complete the application. As they
matter-of-factly described these labors, they were modest about what
they had accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "The work was a blessing from God," Hernandez said as his two
friends nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The current archbishop of Oaxaca, Hector Gonzales Martin, finds it
appropriate that the nearly forgotten case of the two fiscales was
championed by these three farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "This beatification process should be understood as fruit from the
first evangelization of this culture," he said. "Then, as now, the
church has allowed nonclerical individuals to assume important
responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   This may be so, but until the current papacy, some say a claim
that a town in the clouds of Oaxaca had produced two saints might
have fallen on deaf ears in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at all the saints in Catholicism, overwhelmingly they
tend to be white European males. And mostly celibate priests, bishops
and popes," said Timothy Matovina, a professor at the Cushwa Center
for the Study of American Catholicism at Notre Dame University.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet, what is sainthood? It's anyone who has given their life for
Christ. Recognizing this, John Paul II has diversified the communion
of saints and lifted up local heroes in places like Japan, Vietnam
and Russia."</TE>
<TE>   According to Lawrence Cunningham, also a Notre Dame theology
professor, in this diversification process, John Paul II has
canonized more people than all the popes combined since the
Reformation.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is he doing this? For political--meaning public--reasons," he
said. "The pope knows that in Mexico, people are hemorrhaging from
the traditional Catholic Church into Protestantism. So, he wants to
remind them that there is a tradition of heroic sanctity in Mexico's
history."</TE>
<TE>   For Gloria Hernandez of Glendale, who was born near Cajonos, the
beatification of Bautista and De Los Angeles confirms what she has
always believed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd heard about them from my grandmother as a child, but didn't
start praying to the martyrs until I was 20," said Hernandez, 59, who
is a longtime member of St. Cecilia Catholic Church south of downtown
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   She credits their intercession for giving her mortally ill son two
additional years of life and for help in retrieving a car impounded
by immigration authorities at the Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   For the past several years, in addition to her day job as a house
cleaner, Hernandez has organized sales of tamales to raise money for
the beatification. Her voice quickens as she describes her
anticipation of the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "The martyrs are like God to me, and my heart is with them," she
said. "I was nervous when I got married, but I'll be much more
nervous on the day we will be in Mexico City."</TE>

<HD>Rock: Shaking the Pews, but Also a Spirit Unto Itself</HD>
<DH>Music: Not only do more congregations incorporate it into
their services, it also has its own holy sites and relics.</DH>

<LD>Satan can't pick sides in the rock-and-religion debate anymore. When
Saturday night turns into Sunday morning, the drums and electric
guitars put down in smoky nightclubs can be heard again in the
sanctuaries of many churches.</LD>
<LD>   Once bitter enemies, each side in the struggle for young adult
souls is turning its philosophical swords into plowshares of
appreciation. While the rock world commemorates the spiritual roots
of many of its greatest stars, more churches are embracing popular
music as a way to reach a substantially unchurched generation.</LD>
<LD>   U2 and Creed are two of the biggest breakthrough groups bridging
the gap between spirituality and rock culture, says Jim Henke, chief
curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. "A
lot of the best rock 'n' roll has always been the search for truth,
the search for meaning."</LD>
<TE>   In a paper delivered this spring at a Society for the Anthropology
of Religion conference in Cleveland, Laura Helper talked about the
evolving relationship between the rock of ages and rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   Helper, a cultural anthropologist from Fayetteville, Ark., who is
working on a book on rock music and race relations, said that even if
someone wanted to, it would be impossible historically to separate
rock and religion.</TE>
<TE>   What about Al Green, Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke, Patti LaBelle,
gospel music pioneer Thomas Dorsey and hundreds of others who blurred
the dividing line between church and popular music? Many easily move
back and forth from concert halls and the Broadway stage to Sunday
morning worship.</TE>
<TE>   Among the sites where rock started were black and white,
working-class Protestant and Catholic churches "in which bodies are
vehicles for salvation and music not only an expression of joy but an
exhortation and inspiration and movement toward that joy," Helper
says.</TE>
<TE>   Don't knock the sacredness of rock lyrics or relics such as the
late Jimi Hendrix's guitars, Helper says. "What makes them sacred is
that people think they are. It's something that's bigger than you."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she says, consider the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as
a sacred space. In some ways, she says, the rock hall is like a
church, particularly in the way it is designed to preserve traditions
and reenact them to spread the word.</TE>
<TE>   Even the hall's layout is church- like, starting with the
relic-filled first floor and ascending to the hall honoring
inductees, a hushed hallway of illuminated signatures. On the top
floors, Helper says, are two "holy" experiences, a film of rock hall
induction concerts and an exhibit of artifacts connected to John
Lennon, "arguably rock 'n' roll's ultimate martyred saint."</TE>
<TE>   The sacred connection is also making its way into sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is Kirk Franklin performing at a Billy Graham Crusade
or a seven-piece band cranking up the sound and the emotion at a
Sunday worship service, many religious groups find contemporary music
a great way to spread an ancient message.</TE>
<TE>   Christian music festivals feature scores of performers of
Christian pop music. Rock 'n' soul has even made its way into
mainline Protestant churches looking for new ways to bring young
people into their declining folds.</TE>
<TE>   That does not mean Eminem will be welcomed in a Pentecostal
church, or that religious groups still won't protest the sexism,
racism and violence advocated by some popular artists. But it does
mean that religious leaders--and anthropologists--are becoming more
appreciative of what once seemed an alien art form.</TE>
<TE>   When Helper saw the movie "Beach Blanket Bingo" in junior high
school, she noted that one of the characters was an anthropologist,
"a patently square white male academic studying the tribal rites of
youth culture." Although he starts off seeing Frankie Avalon, Annette
Funicello and the rest of the gang as somewhat primitive in their
musical taste, he ends up joining the dance.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, are the secular and sacred parts of rock converging,
Helper says. "Rock 'n' roll is all about this other kind of
spirituality, which is being engaged in life, really joyous in your
body."</TE>
<TE>   In speaking before the anthropological society, Helper admitted
she was mostly joking when she first raised the idea of writing about
the rock hall as sacred space.</TE>
<TE>   But Helper says that as she started to delve deeper into the
topic, she found a much more complex relationship than she first
imagined, both for religious rockers and music fans who do not
participate in organized religion.</TE>
<TE>   For the self-described lapsed Unitarian, there is meaning in the
music.</TE>
<TE>   "Far from being cynical about rock 'n' roll as religion," Helper
says, "I am happy to claim that I am in fact a member of the church
of rock 'n' roll and that rock 'n' roll changed my life."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man killed while driving away in a car he had just stolen in Reseda
was identified Friday by police.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Gonzalez Hernandez, 28, of Northridge was shot in the head
about 3:15 p.m. Thursday while driving a stolen Honda Accord on the
6600 block of Etiwanda Avenue, Los Angeles Police Lt. Gary Hallden
said.</LD>
<LD>   Hallden said Hernandez and as many as five other men in a red or
maroon Toyota had approached a father and son--the son a man in his
early 20s on foot and the father the driver of the Honda, which had
halted. The newcomers fought with the father and son, who ran away,
he said.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez jumped into the abandoned car and drove south on
Etiwanda, followed by his friends in the other vehicle, Hallden said.</TE>
<TE>   Shots were fired at the cars, Hallden said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was hit, but drove a few more blocks. He collapsed after
fleeing the vehicle on Kittridge Street, near Lindley Avenue, Hallden
said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The father and son were taken to a local hospital for treatment of
injuries suffered in the fight. Their conditions were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The other car fled. No arrests have been made, police said.</TE>

<HD>Farm Smog Targeted by EPA</HD>
<DH>Environment: Agency moves to regulate California
agriculture. Farm Bureau seeks to block the action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The agriculture industry's exemption from clean-air controls may be
nearing an end as federal air quality officials announced this week
that they will move ahead with plans to begin regulating farms in
California. The California Farm Bureau, however, quickly filed suit
to block the action.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike most other industries, agriculture is exempt from stringent
smog controls, a loophole the state Legislature granted a generation
ago and that air quality officials tacitly honored until now.</LD>
<LD>   The Farm Bureau, representing 95,000 farmers, wants the exemption
to continue for three more years so experts can better determine how
farms contribute to the pollution problem.</LD>
<TE>   But as the San Joaquin Valley slips further and further behind
clean-air goals--it is home to some of the nation's most polluted
skies--environmentalists and health experts are demanding more
aggressive action.</TE>
<TE>   Three advocacy groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency last year for allowing the agricultural exemption, and in May
the agency agreed to take over the California program.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the EPA announced a proposed rule to accomplish that
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   "California state law needs to comply with the Clean Air Act,"
said Jack Broadbent, director of air programs for the EPA's
California office. "As soon as California removes the agricultural
exemption from state law, the EPA will return the permitting
authority to the state."</TE>
<TE>   The first step would implement a provision of the Clean Air Act
that requires significant polluters to secure permits before adding
new irrigation pumps or livestock disposal ponds, among other things.
Though a permit does not trigger controls, the information they
contain forms the foundation for regulatory programs that could come
later and affect farming operations statewide.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,500 diesel-powered irrigation pumps dot the San Joaquin
Valley. Though many have been cleaned up under a voluntary program,
air quality officials say they still represent a prime target.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say healthful air cannot be restored to the
valley until farms do their fair share.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you get there [to clean air] when you exempt an industry?
They've exempted a huge part of the problem," said Kevin Hall of the
Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) said the state's
$29-billion agriculture industry is being wrongly blamed for air
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "Agriculture has been doing business in California since the '20s,
and it's only when autos and people began moving into the valley that
the air got dirtier," he said. "The people who have been farming and
feeding the state are being blamed for the problem, but it's really
all the growth that is causing this problem."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Cardoza acknowledges that the Legislature will have
little choice but to remove the agricultural exemption.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a fait accompli. I don't know there's much for the
Legislature to do other than comply with the mandate from the federal
government," the assemblyman said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza said a bill to remove the agriculture exemption is likely
to be introduced in the Legislature early next year.</TE>
<TE>   California has an incentive to act. Under the legal agreement
between the EPA and environmentalists, if the state does not lift the
agricultural exemption, it must restrict economic growth in smoggy
cities by late next year or face the loss of more than $3 billion in
federal highway funds the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources
Board, said that of the 87,000 farms statewide, perhaps just a few
hundred would require permits. The program the EPA is proposing
affects only major agricultural operations.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA will receive public comments on its plan until Sept. 3 and
will continue working with farms, air quality officials and the
Department of Agriculture to develop air quality programs to address
farms.</TE>

<HD>Mother, Daughter Struck and Killed by Truck</HD>
<DH>Accidents: Both had darted into traffic during an evening
walk. The family had just relocated to Ventura from the Midwest.</DH>

<LD>An engineer who moved his family from China to the United States to
start a new life was in mourning Friday after losing his wife and
7-year-old daughter in a Ventura traffic accident. Yunsheng Su, 36, a
hydraulics specialist at the Ventura County Flood Control Department,
called police Thursday night after his wife and daughter failed to
return from their regular evening walk.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Yisha Xie, 36, and the couple's daughter, Shan
"Susan" Su, had darted into traffic at Telephone Road and Johnson
Drive and were hit by a truck.</LD>
<LD>   "They were a beautiful family. This is absolutely tragic," said
Sergio Vargas, a colleague of Yunsheng Su. Vargas has started a fund
to help pay for the funerals.</LD>
<TE>   Friends and co-workers on Friday tied pink balloons shaped like
butterflies to a light post at the scene. They also left large
decorated signs, sympathy notes and scattered white roses and
gladiolas.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph on one of the posters shows Xie kneeling next to her
daughter, who is smiling and wearing a light pink dress.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a really good relationship. Susan's mother would take
the time to listen and let her child have a chance to say things,"
said Mikey Destito, a recreation director at the Ventura Boys &amp; Girls
Club, where the youngster attended classes each day.</TE>
<TE>   Destito said her favorite activities were drill team and playing
the card game "Uno." Another club official said Susan lost a tooth at
the club last week and had asked an activities director to put it in
an envelope to save for her mother.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, the family often took walks together
after dinner.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday night, however, Yunsheng Su stayed home as his wife
and daughter set out from the family's Thille Street apartment, just
around the corner from Yunsheng Su's county office.</TE>
<TE>   About 8:30 p.m., the mother and daughter tried to cross Telephone
Road, despite a red light and a sign that warns pedestrians against
crossing at that intersection, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said the intersection is dangerous because of the
high volume of traffic and speeding vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   A 23-year-old Oak View man was driving west on Telephone Road when
he struck the pair. Susan died at the scene and her mother died en
route to Ventura County Medical Center, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver was interviewed at the scene and released. Authorities
said he will not be cited because they believe he was not at fault.</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers and friends said the family had just relocated to
Ventura early last month after living in the Midwest while Yunsheng
Su completed his doctoral work at Kansas State University.</TE>
<TE>   Yunsheng Su and his wife had left their parents and other family
members behind in their homeland--a southeastern province in mainland
China--to move to Kansas about four years ago, colleagues said.
Yunsheng Su was hired by Ventura County after responding to an
Internet ad, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very fortunate to get him," said Jeff Pratt, deputy
director of the Public Works Department. "This is very tough for him
because they just got here and he doesn't really have a large support
system."</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers said the family visited Las Vegas and Disneyland during
their drive from Kansas to Ventura. When the three arrived in
Ventura, flood control employees took the family to a Chinese buffet
for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very attracted to the climate here and the little girl
just loved the beach," Vargas said. Xie was a stay-at-home mom.</TE>
<TE>   Because Yunsheng Su used his savings to move his family to
Ventura, co-workers are trying to raise money to help him with
expenses, Vargas said.</TE>
<TE>   Donations can be made to the Su Memorial Fund at Ventura County
Credit Union, 6026 Telephone Road, Ventura 93003.</TE>

<HD>Split Opinion Delays Rapist's Release</HD>
<DH>Court: Two experts can't agree if Patrick Ghilotti would be
a public threat. State law permits just one more review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN RAFAEL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Two psychologists who initially declared imprisoned serial rapist
Patrick Ghilotti safe for release have split on whether the first
sexual predator to complete a state-mandated treatment plan continues
to present a "substantial danger" to society.</LD>
<LD>   The opposing opinions, revealed Friday, came after the California
Supreme Court issued new standards for the release of sexually
violent predators. But even with specific new guidance from the high
court, the continuing controversy over Ghilotti's case highlights the
difficulty experts have in determining what level of danger
constitutes a public threat, and which repeat offenders are likely to
strike again.</LD>
<LD>   Ghilotti, 46, will remain locked up at Atascadero State Hospital
while he is reevaluated by a different pair of state-appointed
experts. Their findings will be delivered at a hearing Sept. 5 in
Marin County Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   This next round of evaluations could represent the state's last
hope of keeping Ghilotti in confinement. According to a 1996
California statute, the state's petition to keep a predator confined
after he has served his sentence may be reviewed only twice. If the
new evaluators are also split, or if both agree that Ghilotti does
not present a serious danger, he will be released.</TE>
<TE>   If the evaluators agree that Ghilotti's release would put the
public at "a serious and well-founded risk," he is then entitled to
have his case heard by a jury. Judges also have the latitude to
reject the evaluators' findings, the state high court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased to the extent that we're still in the ballgame," said
prosecutor Alan Charmatz, who has fought to keep Ghilotti behind
bars. "We still have the possibility of getting another two-year
commitment" allowed for by state law.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti has been convicted of four rapes and has admitted to six
others. After serving a 12-year prison term for the most recent rape,
he was committed to Atascadero, where he has spent the last four
years. Reached by telephone Friday, Ghilotti declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, the state may recommit repeat sex offenders
to mental institutions two years beyond their original prison
sentence if the felons are found "likely" to commit sexual violence
again. Ghilotti was set to be freed in Marin County last December
after three mental health experts testified that he no longer needed
to be in custody. The state attorney general fought Ghilotti's
release and appealed to the high court.</TE>
<TE>   In its 5-2 ruling in April, the court decided on a standard that
made it easier for judges to keep sexually violent predators behind
bars if there is "a serious and well-founded risk" that the
perpetrator would strike again. That "does not mean that the risk of
reoffense must be higher than 50%," Justice Marvin Baxter wrote for
the majority.</TE>
<TE>   The court also ruled at the time that evaluators may consider
promises by an inmate to undergo therapy and take drugs to diminish
his sex drive.</TE>
<TE>   In light of the court's clarified guidelines, Marin County
Superior Court Judge John Stephen Graham ordered the evaluators to
reconsider Ghilotti's fitness. Their split opinions were revealed in
court on Friday, although the contents of their reports remain under
seal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ghilotti had agreed to certain conditions for his
release--including that he receive drugs to reduce his sex drive and
wear an electronic locating device--the restrictions would not be
required if the examiners find him fit to be released.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't have the legal obligation to do anything except register
as a sex offender" with the state, said Charmatz, Marin County's
deputy district attorney. "It would be us going to him and asking,
'what are you willing to do to protect the public?' "</TE>
<TE>   One of Ghilotti's victims, who attended the brief court hearing
Friday, said that she is "more or less resigned to the fact that he's
going to be released eventually."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she said, "I'm nervous for my granddaughter and
for my daughter and my friends if he is released.... My personal
feeling is that he's going to kill somebody if they let him out."</TE>
<TE>   California's Sexually Violent Predator Act is one of at least 15
similar laws across the nation that permit repeat sex offenders to be
committed to mental institutions after serving their prison terms.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Secession OKd for November Ballot</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state commission formally approved the Hollywood secession measure
for the Nov. 5 ballot Friday, after rejecting last-minute objections
from the city of Los Angeles and a handful of residents.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous vote by the Local Agency Formation Commission
established the language of the ballot measure, including a passage
that spells out the separation payments a Hollywood city would have
to pay Los Angeles. The measure will be on the same ballot as the
proposal for San Fernando Valley secession.</LD>
<LD>   "We've cleared every major hurdle," said Gene La Pietra, founder
of the Hollywood Independence Committee. "A 2 1/2-year effort
culminated today with LAFCO deciding to put this to a vote."</LD>
<TE>   LAFCO's action followed a required "protest hearing," at which
only two voters filed written objections to the Hollywood vote.
Written protests from half of L.A.'s 1.45 million registered voters
would have been required to keep the measure off the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Glazier, co-founder of the anti-secession group called
Hollywood and Los Angeles Together, filed one of the protests.</TE>
<TE>   "Financially, it's going to be a disaster," Glazier said. "I don't
think Hollywood can sustain itself as an independent city."</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO also rejected a request by Los Angeles officials that it
reconsider its earlier finding that a Hollywood city could be
financially healthy. The commission has found that an independent
Hollywood could operate with a budget reserve, even after making the
annual separation payments to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The payments would start at $21.3 million and gradually decline,
fading out in 20 years. LAFCO rejected Los Angeles' request for
payments of $73 million each year for 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   In approving the ballot language Friday, LAFCO agreed with Los
Angeles' position that the measure should inform voters of the
payments. But the commission also decided to include on the ballot a
statement that the payments reflect the amount of taxes paid by
Hollywood residents in excess of the value of city services the area
receives. That explanation had been sought by secessionists.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors adopted similar language for the Valley
secession measure Thursday. In a procedural action, the board is
scheduled Tuesday to approve the Hollywood measure for the same
special election set for Valley cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, candidates for Hollywood's five City Council seats
may begin circulating nominating petitions, which have an Aug. 9
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the race for mayor in the proposed Valley city may
become more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Two new candidates took out papers for possible runs against
Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), the only declared
candidate. The possible new contenders are a North Hollywood
activist, Greg Roberts, and Scott Sobhani of Valley Glen, a
telecommunications industry consultant and former vice president at
Lockheed Martin.</TE>

<HD>Tighter Fence to Secure Perimeter at LAX</HD>
<DH>Safety: City will install high-tech barrier linked to
surveillance cameras in an effort to make travelers feel safer.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city plans to beef up security around Los Angeles International
Airport's perimeter by installing motion detection technology that
will help police discern whether an animal, person or big rig is
tangling with the heavy chain-link fence that surrounds the facility.</LD>
<LD>   This new system, together with closed-circuit television cameras,
more intense lighting and a concrete barrier to prevent vehicles from
crashing through the bottom of the fence, will be installed at LAX
starting early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Perimeter fencing is to be reinforced in a further attempt to
prevent attacks on the world's fifth-busiest airport.</LD>
<TE>   "Our goal is to make LAX the safest airport we can," said Mayor
James K. Hahn, who was forced several times to pause during a news
conference Friday as jets landed and took off nearby on the airport's
busy northern runways.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of the improvements will cost $15 million and will
upgrade eight miles of fencing on the facility's western and northern
edges by Christmas 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport and Miami International
Airport have installed similar systems, which are based on a design
used for maximum-security fencing in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   A cable attached to the top of the new 8-foot-high fence will help
police detect activity near the perimeter. An object that strikes the
fence will disrupt a low-voltage current in the cable, sending a
signal to the nearest camera. The camera will turn and focus on the
intruder.</TE>
<TE>   "The system is sensitive enough to differentiate between a fox, a
soccer ball or a person climbing the fence," said Thomas E. Day, a
consultant at Bechtel/JGM, a company hired by the Airport Commission
to study security at LAX after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "What a great help to overworked police sitting in the monitoring
station to know what is out there."</TE>
<TE>   The changes are meant to protect vulnerable spots on the airport's
perimeter, even though the existing 5-foot-high fence meets
guidelines of the Federal Aviation Administration, city officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Enhanced perimeter security at LAX will also include construction
of a paved road adjacent to the fence to provide police with better
access, and of a series of 16-foot-high gates at airfield entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the gates will be installed at each of the four entry
points. Airfield visitors will enter through the first gate, which
will close behind their vehicles. Guards will check the visitors'
credentials before opening the second gate.</TE>
<TE>   In the first phase of the project, fencing that faces Westchester
Parkway on the airport's north side and Pershing Drive along the
facility's western edge will be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The second phase will be considerably smaller and involve portions
of fence along Imperial Highway and Sepulveda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Workers will start building the new fence by sinking a concrete
barrier 4 feet into ground. This barrier will extend several feet
above ground, and the fence, with mesh openings of 2 inches or
smaller, will be installed on top of it. Six strands of barbed wire,
on V-shaped brackets with three strands on either side, will be on
top of the fence.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance cameras and lights will be installed on posts every
400 feet, about 10 feet behind the fence.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials said Friday that they hope the promise of
improved perimeter security will entice wary travelers back to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to keep the public informed about these security
enhancements," said Paul Green, the airport agency's chief operating
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "So all those folks who have occasion to visit and work at the
airport will feel a greater level of comfort."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Urban League Returning to L.A.</HD>
<DH>Rights: After a 20-year absence, the group will hold its
annual conference here in what some see as a sign of the city's
racial progress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON and JOHN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The National Urban League, one of the nation's largest and most
influential civil rights organizations, kicked off its 92nd annual
conference this weekend, returning to Los Angeles after a 20-year
absence.</LD>
<LD>   The league, founded to promote economic self-reliance for African
Americans, had planned to return in 1996 but pulled out to protest
then-Gov. Pete Wilson's support for the anti-affirmative-action
Proposition 209.</LD>
<LD>   To some observers, the organization's return is a measure of
racial progress in both the city and the state.</LD>
<TE>   By Los Angeles' standards, the Urban League convention, with
10,000 delegates and visitors, is neither inordinately large nor
unusually lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   "But in light of history, its return is iconic," said Michael
Collins, vice president of the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau. The bureau has been wooing the Urban League to return since
1996. "It speaks to a time when L.A. and California were in limbo....
Now what's obvious is that ... Siberia has changed."</TE>
<TE>   What also has changed, said John Mack, president of the Los
Angeles affiliate of the league, is that Wilson is no longer
governor. "It's a different time in history, and enough time has
elapsed to hold [the convention] here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, the National Urban League has decided to pull its
2003 conference from Cincinnati because of poor race relations there,
according to the group's president, Hugh Price.</TE>
<TE>   But race relations in the Los Angeles remain at a delicate point,
Mack said, citing two issues: the videotaped beating of a black
teenager by a white Inglewood police officer and L.A. Mayor James K.
Hahn's refusal to support former Police Chief Bernard C. Parks' bid
for a second term.</TE>
<TE>   The videotape has refocused attention on the struggle of people of
color against police brutality, Mack said, and African Americans are
still "rebounding" from their disappointment in Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Mack rescinded Hahn's invitation to the annual gala of the
league's local chapter in April, and said he pointedly did not invite
the mayor to participate in or attend the national conference.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably calculated that this is the early part of his tenure
as mayor, and folks would forgive and forget," Mack said. "A whole
lot of people are not prepared to forget; I'll leave it to my
minister friends to forgive."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But the Urban League's primary mission is to forge business and
community partnerships that lead to economic self-sufficiency--issues
that have moved to the forefront in African American communities
around the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In its just-released State of Black America 2001 report, 60% of
the African Americans surveyed said economic opportunity should be
the primary focus of black organizations today. Sixty-seven percent
said they wanted to own their own business.</TE>
<TE>   The two primary obstacles to business ownership for people of
color, however, are gaining access to capital and acquiring top-notch
management skills, Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   Economic concerns were cited as the biggest problems that
respondents personally expect to face in the next 10 years, but they
tied with discrimination as the most important problem facing black
people as a whole today.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns about police brutality and skepticism toward the criminal
justice system remain significant issues: 43% of respondents said
they believed that they had been stopped by the police because of
their race. Forty-five percent said they worry about being a victim
of police brutality, and three-fourths said they think the criminal
justice system is biased against black people.</TE>
<TE>   Mack noted that although the Urban League historically has been
viewed as an African American organization, the Los Angeles chapter
serves a diverse constituency. About 51% of the people it serves are
African American, 30% are Latino, and the rest are Asian and white.</TE>
<TE>   The five-day conference will include workshops and plenary session
speeches by leading corporate, government and civil rights figures.
There will be corporate exhibits, a job fair and health fair, and an
African American vendor marketplace. About 360 teenagers from around
the country will be housed in dormitories at UCLA and mentored by
local businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The conference theme touches on the goal of combining opportunity
and equality to create one America--something organizers say took on
a special meaning after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But patriotism and the sense of togetherness left African
Americans and other people of color with an "unfinished agenda," Mack
said. "We cannot have one America until some of these issues are
addressed."</TE>
<TE>   League President Price will highlight those unfinished issues
Sunday in his keynote speech.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, however, he noted the importance of keeping pace with the
social and economic developments of the times. For African Americans,
the 1800s were marked by the freedom revolution; the 20th century saw
the equal rights revolution, in which gains were often made through
the courts. The 21st century will be marked by a development
revolution that centers around education and entrepreneurship, Price
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've fully absorbed that yet," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Corporate, Asian Cultures Together</HD>
<DH>Training: Nonprofit group encourages workshop participants
to be more assertive in using diligence, skills to get ahead in
workplace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIN CHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was just a hypothetical situation, but it showed dead-on what a
nonprofit organization called Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics
Inc., or LEAP, wants to accomplish.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a buttoned-up business suit that made her look like the
well-groomed executive she wanted to imitate, workshop facilitator
Audrey Yamagata-Noji whipped back her black hair and strolled up to a
conference table of six Asian Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The six were playing the roles of business executives, and
Yamagata-Noji, with a wry smile, floated a proposal for a new
diversity initiative and waited for suggestions.</LD>
<TE>   Silence.</TE>
<TE>   "Well?" she asked, raising her eyebrows. There were a few grins
and a mumbled "great." But mostly the six executives remained
politely quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Yamagata-Noji was not happy.</TE>
<TE>   "What if you were the only person of color in the room when I
asked that question, and you didn't respond?" Yamagata-Noji asked.
"How often does that happen--when you are in a setting where you are
looking for more opportunities, but you aren't able to get at them
because you're frozen with indecision?"</TE>
<TE>   There were some sheepish shrugs and a lot of nods.</TE>
<TE>   And a lot of time spent thinking by the participants--which is
exactly what LEAP wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Through the mock situation, Yamagata-Noji highlighted rifts
between some Asian American tendencies and American management
styles. Though a non-Asian executive might perceive the six quiet
participants as unwilling or uninterested, many simply didn't want to
appear too forward and desired a one-on-one chat instead.</TE>
<TE>   And while LEAP works with non-Asians to change their perceptions
of Asian Americans, it concentrates mostly on encouraging Asian
Americans to assume more responsibility by not hesitating to act with
assertiveness, especially when opportunities present themselves at
the conference table.</TE>
<TE>   The winding hallways and gray doors of LEAP's Little Tokyo
headquarters resemble a drab hospital ward. But the lackluster decor
belies a more dynamic mission "to achieve full participation and
equality for Asian Pacifics" through leadership training and public
policy research.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Asian Americans to lead in all sectors, from CEO to White
House government to head of nonprofit corporations," Yamagata-Noji
said. "We stereotypically are seen as hard workers ... and sometimes
that doesn't work in our favor for getting promoted and getting
ahead. The reward is more work--not a promotion, not opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   LEAP, which celebrated its 20th anniversary July 18 with a
gathering of about 600 supporters in Universal City, charges
companies $3,500 per person for its workshops and uses the money to
fund low-cost or free community and student workshops and public
policy research.</TE>
<TE>   Through its workshops and mentoring efforts, LEAP aims to "smash
the glass ceiling from above and below, simultaneously," said J.D.
Hokoyama, the group's founder and president.</TE>
<TE>   Hye Ok Park of Fresno, a participant in a leadership development
workshop for those in higher education, called LEAP "an American-type
of leadership training with an understanding of an Asian cultural
background."</TE>
<TE>   A LEAP workshop eight years ago helped Debbie Barba lead without
compromising her Japanese American cultural values. The Anaheim Hills
resident found a way to promote herself that meshed with the way her
parents raised her--to never brag in order to elevate her position.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of saying, 'Look at me, I'm great,' I talked about how
great the people were who worked for me," Barba said. "It's saying
the same thing but in a fashion that fits me."</TE>
<TE>   Barba, who once aspired to just go from answering the "411" calls
to the "0" requests as a telephone operator at SBC Pacific Bell, is
now a vice president at the company.</TE>
<TE>   But by using words from American corporate culture such as
"synergy" and "proactive," LEAP has drawn criticism from some who say
it caters to certain businesses and to American-born Asians.</TE>
<TE>   LEAP tends to place an emphasis on getting "Asians to adapt to
corporate culture, rather than getting corporate culture to change
its management style to adjust to the diversity of their workforce,"
said L. Ling-chi Wang, a UC Berkeley Asian American studies professor
and guest lecturer for LEAP.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that LEAP spend more time encouraging CEOs to embrace
unfamiliar styles of leadership from Asia, such as those centered on
consensus building.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem, Wang said, is that some non-Asian chief
executives who take classes and finance LEAP workshops are "just
going through the motions to show that they are committed to
diversity."</TE>
<TE>   IBM spokesman Jim Sinocchi countered that IBM, a LEAP sponsor,
changes its management "in order to stay competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Just 2% of IBM executives in the United States were Asian in 1996,
company officials said. As of last month, Asians made up 5.4% of the
company's executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that our company on the inside reflects the
market on the outside," Sinocchi said. "To ignore that is just
suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Belinda Butler Vea, one of the six quiet "executives" at the table
Yamagata-Noji had approached, had traveled from Phoenix to the recent
workshop at Cal Poly Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   After the questioning by Yamagata-Noji, she spent the next four
days at the workshop trying to clarify a lifetime of muddled goals.</TE>
<TE>   A daughter of migrant farm workers, Vea, 45, returned to work as
program coordinator of Arizona State University's humanities program
invigorated by her LEAP experience.</TE>
<TE>   She immediately told her boss her ambition--to become a dean of
student affairs--with a frankness and sense of purpose that Vea said
she could not have mustered before the workshop.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't come away from LEAP without a different perception of
yourself," Vea said. "You're among a group of people that affirm what
you want to do in your life. It makes you feel stronger."</TE>

<HD>Man Killed in Ambush Near Home</HD>
<DH>Crime: A 19-year-old in Winnetka is shot in an incident
that is believed to be gang-related.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 19-year-old man was shot and killed early Friday morning outside
his family's Winnetka house as he returned from a nearby cyber cafe,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Nguyen, was ambushed just after midnight as he walked up the
driveway of a home on the 19700 block of Lull Street that he shared
with his parents, his 2-year-old son and the boy's mother, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   A gunman driving a red or maroon Toyota minivan fired at least six
shots at Nguyen, striking him several times in the upper torso, Los
Angeles Police Department Officer Alex Baez said.</LD>
<TE>   Nguyen, who was pronounced dead at the scene, may have been
followed home from Netstreet Internet Cafe in the 9200 block of
Reseda Boulevard in Northridge, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to be gang-related," said Det. Terry Carlos of the
Asian Crimes Investigation Section, which is handling the case.</TE>
<TE>   Police retrieved a surveillance tape and other items from the
cafe, where Nguyen was playing video games with friends until about
11 p.m. Thursday, said the owner, Charles Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen has been a customer at the cafe since it opened six months
ago, going there about four times a week to play such strategy video
games as Diablo and War Craft, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Nguyen recently left his job at an electronics store
and was taking classes at an adult school.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday afternoon, about a dozen friends gathered near the
doorway where, hours earlier, Nguyen had been killed. They placed
flowers and candles near the front door and garage, which were marred
by bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic," said one of them, John Dinh, 22. "All we ever
wanted to do was have fun."</TE>

<HD>Gift Provides a Reprieve for Museum</HD>
<DH>Community: Donation of $20,000 saves Leimert Park Village
institution from eviction. Others offer help to save civil rights-era
displays.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took Brian Breye 30 years to build up the Museum in Black, and
just a few days to pack it into more than 100 boxes when debts forced
him to close.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the check: $20,000 from a man he'd never met.</LD>
<LD>   Gene Scott, pastor of Los Angeles University Cathedral, made the
donation, saving the Leimert Park Village museum from eviction.</LD>
<TE>   Property owner Edward MacDaniel said he was evicting Breye because
he owed $20,000 in back rent. Breye disputes the amount, but paid the
$20,000 with Scott's gift to close the matter, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he unpacked boxes and continued placing on display the
museum's more than 5,000 pieces, which include numerous slave and
civil rights-era artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   Others rushed to help the museum once news of its closing became
public. Breye said that Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn, the city's
Cultural Affairs Department and numerous private and public
benefactors have contacted him to offer help. Scott's spokesman, Mark
Travis, also said their "commitment to the museum will be ongoing."
Scott has donated to other local museums in financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Breye has never charged admission. He now is planning a grand
re-opening, hoping to have the museum back in order by next weekend.
He said he hopes Hahn and his other benefactors, including Scott,
will attend.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he repainted the walls and made upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   He frequently is interrupted by people who don't know the museum
closed. In the last week, he said, he turned away at least nine buses
of schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   College instructor Nenjali Jackson walked into the building
Friday, shocked to find the disarray. "This is like having a major
church in a black community uprooted," she said.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed. But he comforted himself in something his grandmother
used to say: "Out of bad comes good."</TE>

<HD>College Trustee to Call It Quits</HD>
<DH>Education: Norman Nagel changes his mind about seeking
reelection to the county board, which is mired in a spending scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of the troubled Ventura County Community College
District Board of Trustees said Friday he has changed his mind and
will not run for reelection in November.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Norman Nagel announced that he would seek another
four-year term. On Friday, however, he said he reconsidered after
talking with his family, friends and supporters. He said that he
determined he had accomplished everything he set out to do since he
joined the board in 1994, especially with the passage this year of a
$356-million bond to upgrade the district's three campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Nagel said the recent spending scandal involving Chancellor Philip
Westin, who has been placed on paid leave pending an investigation,
was not a factor in his decision.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought it was time to turn over the reins to somebody else,"
said Nagel, 59, a Thousand Oaks orthodontist. "I thought about what
it is I would need to accomplish in the next four years and decided
there wasn't a lot. I set some goals and priorities, and I feel I've
met them."</TE>
<TE>   If he had sought another term, he undoubtedly would have faced
stiff competition from a teachers' union-backed challenger for his
seat on the five-member board. The Ventura County Federation of
College Teachers and other critics have said they would fight to
unseat any trustee who supported the chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Westin faced enormous public criticism earlier this summer when it
was revealed that he had charged the district more than $119,000 for
business-related expenses from 1997 to 2001. An audit cleared him of
violating district policy and criminal wrongdoing, but critics still
demanded that he resign or be fired.</TE>
<TE>   Although the board knew of Westin's spending, it voted 4 to 1 in
May to award him a new contract and a $30,000 raise, bringing his
annual salary to $203,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm dismayed and saddened by the way he's been vilified, and the
way his situation has been handled," Nagel said Friday. "I think the
bond issue was passed because of the board and Dr. Westin, not in
spite of the board and Dr. Westin."</TE>
<TE>   Trustee John Tallman, who voted against renewing Westin's
contract, and board Vice President Art Hernandez also are up for
reelection in the fall. Both have said they favor removing Westin as
chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Allan Jacobs, whose term expires in 2004, is the target of
a recall effort by a conservative Republican organization because of
his support for Westin. Trustee Bob Gonzales, whose term also expires
in two years, has not been targeted for recall.</TE>

<LD>The Anaheim Union High School District Board of Trustees has filled a
seat left vacant by the recent death of Benny Hernandez, whose long
illness was closely watched in the Latino community.</LD>
<LD>   The board named La Palma resident and former Councilman Brian
O'Neal to the seat.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal has two sons who graduated from the district's Kennedy High
School.</LD>
<TE>   "I have been involved in education and youth in some way for over
30 years," O'Neal said in a statement. "I felt this was the next step
in helping our district's youth."</TE>
<TE>   As a former member of the board's facilities committee, he
proposed a bond initiative to improve district campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees agreed to place a $132-million bond measure on the
ballot, and O'Neal led a citizens' advisory committee that promoted
the concept last year.</TE>

<LD>Tustin police shot and injured two suspected car thieves late
Thursday after they tried to run the officers over with their car,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, who were not identified, were hospitalized with gunshot
wounds at UCI Medical Center in Orange. They are expected to recover
and will be booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began about 6:15 p.m. when officers received a report
of a stolen 1984 Toyota Celica.</LD>
<TE>   Officers found the car about 7 p.m. on Red Hill Avenue near Bryan
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators watched as five men in a gray Toyota Corolla pulled
next to the stolen car an hour later, said Tustin police Sgt. Mark
Hein. Police arrested two men without incident. The third ran and was
later found.</TE>
<TE>   Two men stayed inside the Corolla and "drove toward the officers,
who fired for their safety," Hein said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers were not injured.</TE>
<TE>   After trying to run over the officers, the two men led police on a
pursuit that ended near Edinger and Grand avenues in Santa Ana, Hein
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating.</TE>

<HD>As the Sun Sets on Another Little League Season, There's
Something Amiss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Little League season is drawing to a close at Stearns Park in
Long Beach, and umpire Damon Hawn says that one of the most memorable
lines was uttered by a young infielder who allowed a ground ball to
go through his legs. "Coach," the kid said afterward, "I lost it in
the sun."</LD>
<LD>   Yer outta there! The Dodgers and Adelphia, who teamed up for a
foam-finger promotion the other day (see accompanying), don't have
too much in common. Adelphia has been the one in trouble with federal
umpires.</LD>
<LD>   The bankrupt communications company's founder was recently
arrested, along with two of his sons and two associates, for
allegedly looting $1 billion from Adelphia.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, meanwhile, just steal a few bases.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of crime: There are watchdogs and there are watchcats--or
meerkats--in the case of the London neighborhood visited by Mark
Scott of Long Beach (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Spiked balls, not drinks: With Manhattan Beach's annual volleyball
tournament a week away, city officials served this warning: No
drinking allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, imbibing was heavy, restroom facilities were few (four
stalls) and the surf was dangerous. The result: More than 50 rescues
during the two-day event. "People were going into the water to
relieve themselves," county Fire Capt. Mike Cunningham told the Beach
Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Out of options? Vallen Sarnoff of Yorba Linda was in Manhattan
taking voice lessons when she noticed an icy warning in the hallway
(see photo). "What were you allowed to do," asked mom Carolyn
Sarnoff, "hover?"</TE>
<TE>   Free item: Since rumor has it that the San Diego Chargers may move
back to L.A., it's time to bone up on the team's history. What's the
origin of the club's nickname? Les Liebsen of L.A. points out that it
was conceived by owner Barron Hilton, who had just introduced Carte
Blanche, one of the nation's first credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: The media Web site www.ronfineman.com gave
high marks to a story on illegal car-poolers by KCOP-TV's Gigi
Graciette. She accompanied the California Highway Patrol on a
ride-along that netted one driver who didn't even have a driver's
license (let alone a passenger). What was funny was that the motorist
produced another form of ID: an application to join the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Right, baby! Where did the Hollywood Walk of Fame install a star
for actor Mike Myers of the "Austin Powers" movies? Why, in front of
the International Love Boutique, of course.</TE>
<TE>   I'm all wet: After I printed what I thought was a typographical
error about "dive-in" movies, Holly Rizzo, Elizabeth Rothbart, Rod
Kavanagh and several other readers chastised me.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw c'mon, Harvey," Kavanagh said, "you haven't heard about
dive-in movies? They've been a big draw at water parks and public

<DH>Loss of habitat in the Santa Monica Mountains threatens
Western pond species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a scorcher of an afternoon, the kind of day when it's hard to
imagine water, much less pond turtles, left anywhere in the Santa
Monica Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   In the heat, Rosi Dagit and her small crew of volunteers hike up a
dry creek to a sandstone gorge where--surprisingly--a small pool of
water has survived the drought. It's not much. There are probably
bigger bathtubs in the mansions that dot nearby hills.</LD>
<LD>   Dagit, a biologist, crawls up to the water and points. On cue, a
tiny green head pokes through the surface. It's a baby turtle, about
the size of a dollar pancake. It takes a quick breath and vanishes
into the murk. Another soon emerges and does a passable version of
the breaststroke.</LD>
<TE>   "They are the cutest things," says Dagit. "I could sit and watch
them all day."</TE>
<TE>   She's correct. On a scale of one to 10 for cuteness, the turtles
warrant an 11. And that's just one reason they're in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Dagit works for the Resource Conservation District of the Santa
Monica Mountains, and she has brought her charges to the creek as
part of a two-year study of the elusive reptiles. Among the questions
she hopes to answer: How many turtles live in the Santa Monicas? What
types of habitat do they need? What do they eat and who eats them?
Where do they go on Saturday night?</TE>
<TE>   Dagit and her 40 or so volunteers plan to spend hundreds of hours
observing turtles, an activity that seems leisurely but actually
involves filling out a lot of forms.</TE>
<TE>   The real data bonanza will come in the fall when rice-sized radio
transmitters are attached to 10 adult turtles, which are about 6
inches long. This will allow Dagit to continuously track their
movements. That way, she'll learn how they spend Saturday night, and
where--and, perhaps, with whom --they awaken on Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Western pond turtles are native to the West Coast and were once
common in streams from the Canadian border to Baja. Today, they are
listed as endangered in Oregon and Washington, but California has
designated them a "species of special concern."</TE>
<TE>   There is some good news. Dagit and other biologists believe that
pond turtles can be saved if--and it's a big if--people are willing
to understand the problems facing the reptiles and will make a few
small sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   The turtles' biggest problem is habitat loss, caused by the
draining of wetlands and by development. The soggy coast of
Washington, for example, is seemingly ideal turtle habitat, but only
17 pond turtles have been found there since 1986. "Last year we even
had two turtles that were shot," said Frank Slavens, who works with
the state's turtle recovery project.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, about 2,000 turtles remain, and Dagit
believes that there could be as many as 10 small populations in the
Santa Monicas. The habitat problem here, she suspects, involves the
females.</TE>
<TE>   Before laying their eggs in the autumn, the females take a long
drink of water and depart for higher, drier ground--sometimes
traveling a mile or more. After they've selected a site, the turtles
release the water to soften the soil. Then they dig and bury their
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Though many creeks in the Santa Monicas are in good shape, Dagit
suspects that development has robbed the turtles of nesting sites
throughout their range.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers are picky, and if they can't find a suitable nesting
site, they don't nest. That means no baby turtles, which means the
overall population drops.</TE>
<TE>   If they do nest, success is hardly ensured. After hatching in the
spring, the babies must journey back to water through a gantlet of
predators that includes raccoons, coyotes, bobcats and bullfrogs.
Often, the moms are also eaten.</TE>
<TE>   In the Santa Monicas, the turtles are fortunate, because a few
mountain lions remain, and the big cats eat the raccoons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you live in the mountains and you want to help turtles,
animal-proof your garbage," to discourage raccoons and other animals,
said Dan Holland, the world's foremost expert on pond turtles.
"Another thing I can't overemphasize is that people have a really bad
habit of buying turtles as pets, and when they get tired of them they
throw them in the nearest pond."</TE>
<TE>   Holland has found 29 species of exotic turtles in pond turtle
habitat on the West Coast. And as California has become home to
turtles from all over the world, the turtles that evolved here for
more than 1 million years have been disappearing. Why? Exotic turtles
often bring exotic diseases that kill pond turtles.</TE>
<TE>   "These pet turtles belong in the part of the world they originated
in," said Holland. "How would Californians feel if people were
harvesting thousands of our native turtles and shipping them to
Florida as pets?"</TE>
<TE>   Dagit, for one, believes that the situation for the native turtles
is far from hopeless. But she is concerned about how a drought could
affect them. She worries, too, about the problem of cute little
turtles being plucked from streams and tossed into fishbowls.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, she frets about development in the local
mountains. "People look at the Santa Monicas and say there's so much
space left, but that's from the perspective of a human, not all the
other things living here," she said. "We really don't know how it all
fits together."</TE>
<TE>   No one suggests that the entire ecosystem will unravel should pond
turtles disappear. No one, in fact, really knows exactly what impact
turtles have on an ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   This much is known: For hundreds of thousands of years, pond
turtles endured in Southern California. They have been washed out to
sea by winter storms and sandblasted by years of drought.</TE>
<TE>   But there were always a few that had the strength, will and
tenacity to climb back into the mountains and find a small pool of
water shielded by the sun.</TE>
<TE>   The turtles of the Santa Monica Mountains, scientists say, are
proof that evolution is not a sprint, but a marathon full of hurdles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Weiss, 101, a metaphysician and university professor who fought
several age discrimination battles, died July 5 at his home in
Washington, D.C. He had a heart ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Weiss founded the Metaphysical Society of America in 1947, as well
as its academic journal, Review of Metaphysics.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Manhattan, Weiss received his doctorate in philosophy from
Harvard University in 1929. He taught at Bryn Mawr College and then
at Yale from 1946 until 1969, when he was forced to retire as
Sterling Professor of Philosophy because of his age, 68.</LD>
<TE>   After unsuccessfully fighting that rule, he lost a $1-million age
discrimination suit against Fordham University, which had rescinded
its offer of a prestigious chairmanship.</TE>
<TE>   He taught at Catholic University from 1969 until 1992, when the
university announced it would not renew its annual contract with the
then-91-year-old Weiss. He challenged the firing and was reinstated
after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that he was a
victim of age discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the university two years later, he continued
to write books until his death. The most recent of his more than 30
books, "Emphatics," dealt with the use of language and was published
in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Jonathan Lopez never thought he would have the courage to dance on
stage. The aspiring death metal vocalist didn't have his band mask to
hide behind while performing in front of his peers.</LD>
<LD>   But after two weeks of intense training in theatrical arts, the
17-year-old from Anaheim fit right in with the dozen or so other boys
swiveling hips in grass skirts and wigs Friday on stage at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really shy," Lopez explained before his performance.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't really talk to a lot of people because sometimes they
have a tendency of being really mean."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and 39 other students are wrapping up the 11th annual Summer
at The Center program with performances today.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be showing what they've learned at the two-week dancing
and singing camp for at-risk youth.</TE>
<TE>   Their show will feature songs from movies and plays such as
"Grease," "Men in Black" and several Disney tunes.</TE>
<TE>   The 40 youths come from a variety of backgrounds and have had
learning problems, suffered physical or mental abuse, or had ties to
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   They are students at continuation and juvenile detention
facilities from around the county.</TE>
<TE>   Summer at The Center, underwritten by private donations and
corporate sponsors, aims to give students musical and theatrical
training that will foster an appreciation for the arts, but also give
them life skills that will help them enter the work force. More than
96% of the students graduate from high school, said Bill Brawley, who
has directed the program for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   The teens were apprehensive at first.</TE>
<TE>   "We all had equal amounts of lack of confidence ... we all had to
test ourselves in front of each other," Lopez said as their lessons
ended this week. "But that only brought us together more as a group."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and staff members were pleased with the students' effort
and progress. "It's amazing to see the change in his demeanor and
personality," said Sabrina Vasquez, Lopez's regular teacher, who came
to watch his dress rehearsal. "It has done wonders for him. It lets
him see what he is capable of."</TE>
<TE>   Not only have they made new friends, the students have also gained
confidence. "I love that I am at a place in my life right now where I
can encourage [other students] and tell them that I understand how
they feel and that we are all here to support them," said Megan
Zuliani, 18, of Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Zuliani, who also took part in last year's program, said the
students this year have made an extra effort to develop
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "People are dealing with a lot of insecurities and problems in
their life, but are able to express themselves and feel that it's
OK," Zuliani said. "Everyone is part of a team."</TE>
<TE>   Brawley, who shouted stage directions, coached and cajoled the
youthful performers past their stage fright Friday, watched with
pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the kids will leave believing in themselves and in turn
believe in others," Brawley said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids can do anything as long as you support them and show that
you believe in them."</TE>

<HD>Evdokia Petrov, 88; Soviet Spy in Australia Defected With
Husband</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Evdokia Petrov, a Soviet spy who sparked an international incident
when she and her husband defected to Australia in 1954, has died in
Melbourne, the government said Friday. She was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Petrov, who lived in the southern city for 48 years under the name
Maria Anna Allyson, died July 19 of complications from an operation
on her back, the Herald Sun reported Friday.</LD>
<LD>   She and her husband, Vladimir, made international headlines when
they defected at the height of the Cold War.</LD>
<TE>   The couple arrived in Australia in February 1951, when Vladimir
took up the post of third secretary at the Soviet Embassy. However,
he was covertly serving as the resident KGB spy.</TE>
<TE>   Evdokia Petrov was to be the embassy's accountant and secretary,
with covert responsibility for deciphering and writing coded messages
exchanged between the embassy and officials in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   But after three years, her husband became disillusioned with the
Soviet Union and decided to defect, former Australian intelligence
agent Michael Thwaites said.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after Petrov's defection, armed Soviet agents abducted
his wife and dragged her through a roaring crowd at Sydney Airport
and onto a flight bound for Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   She was being returned against her will to face the repercussions
of her husband's defection.</TE>
<TE>   But Australian police dramatically snatched her from the Soviets
when the plane stopped for fuel in the northern city of Darwin.</TE>
<TE>   The Petrovs were granted asylum, Australian citizenship and new
identities in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Their defections resulted in the closure of the Soviet Embassy in
Canberra and the expulsion of staff from the Australian Embassy in
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Thwaites said the defection also led to the unmasking of 600
Soviet spies around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "They were extremely big fish as defectors," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir, who lived under the assumed name Sven Allyson, died in
Melbourne in 1991 at age 84.</TE>
<TE>   Details about surviving relatives were not immediately available.</TE>

<HD>Young Catholic Pilgrims Feel Embrace of the Global Church</HD>
<DH>Gathering: Youths from California meet counterparts from
169 other countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>During a Mass this week here at World Youth Day, Mayra Giallo
extended her hand as a sign of peace--the custom in her Southern
California parish--to a handsome young Frenchman next to her.</LD>
<LD>   "He grabbed me and kissed me on both cheeks," the 22-year-old Cal
State Northridge student from La Puente said, blushing. "I was like,
let's do that again!"</LD>
<LD>   But Giallo quickly said adieu to her new friend because she, like
hundreds of other Southern California Catholics, had more weighty
reasons for making the pilgrimage to World Youth Day, a weeklong
event that feels like a combination of Woodstock, the Olympics and an
old-fashioned revival meeting headlined by Pope John Paul II.</LD>
<TE>   The Southern Californians wanted to experience Catholicism's
global reach, to deepen their faith and to see John Paul in person
before he dies.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to see the pope, to see a living saint," said Elena Medina,
a 27-year-old from La Puente who carried with her a handful of
prayers--for health, for a financial reversal, for leniency for a
jailed son--that had been scrawled on paper by friends and family
members.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the travelers to Canada are outside of California for the
first time, an added bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "To think someone like me can actually get out of Los Angeles and
see the pope--I've never been on a plane before," said Glenda Garcia,
a 17-year-old Fairfax High School senior who had joined more than
200,000 other Catholics from 170 countries in Toronto. "And I've
never seen so many trees."</TE>
<TE>   She, like many of the young pilgrims, comes from a working-class,
immigrant family that couldn't underwrite the trip, which may cost
more than $2,200. But through entrepreneurial efforts--baby-sitting,
and holding raffles, car washes and charity dances--many participants
earned their way. Others had received partial scholarships from their
churches or dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Glenda's revenue-generating battle cry was "Avon calling." She had
sold lipstick, makeup and lotions to school friends, church members
and her family for the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom bought a lot, even though she really doesn't use it,"
Glenda said. "She just wanted to make sure I could go."</TE>
<TE>   The Avon fund-raising technique had been devised by Sister Karen
Collier, who heads an 88-member World Youth Day delegation from the
Los Angeles archdiocese. She became an Avon representative and then
deputized interested Catholic youths to sell the products, allowing
them to keep both their commissions and hers.</TE>
<TE>   In Toronto, the Catholics have made sure they get their money's
worth. Most get up for early morning Masses and don't fall asleep
until well after midnight. In between, they attend religious classes
run by cardinals and bishops and go to confession at open-air booths
set up in parks. They visit (and sometimes flirt with) fellow
believers from far-off countries, exchanging decorative pins or
e-mail addresses with people from China, Finland and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   They throw Frisbees, wave their countries' flags and exchange
native snacks.</TE>
<TE>   And they hold impromptu dances and musical concerts on the street.
The 300-member group from Our Lady of the Pillar in Santa Ana is
especially popular, merrily blasting out songs in Spanish,
accompanied by an army of guitars, tambourines, bongos and a tinny
portable sound system.</TE>
<TE>   "At night, when you finally get to bed, you get chills about
everything you've seen and done," said Priscilla Scaff, a 16-year-old
from Costa Mesa. "It's like a dream."</TE>
<TE>   For two of Southern California's local prelates, the vision of
hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic young Catholics gathering to
cheer for the church and John Paul ("John Paul Two, we love you!") is
heavenly, especially after the church sex scandal that has rocked the
U.S. and their dioceses this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's demonstrating to me the deep faith young people have in our
church," said Tod D. Brown, the bishop of Orange, before he said a
special Mass on Friday in a hotel ballroom for more than 700 pilgrims
from Orange County. "And the special charisma that the pope has to
bring young people together."</TE>
<TE>   Says Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles: "This reinvigorates
their faith, and the pope's presence really, really launched that
spirit."</TE>
<TE>   The young Catholics find little to complain about, even though
many of them are experiencing the spartan life often associated with
religious journeys: hoofing it for miles to event sites, grabbing
food where they can and sleeping on church floors.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, Candy Contreras, 16, will sleep with her friends in
sleeping bags in the city park where a papal Mass will be said
Sunday. The service is expected to draw 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be so many nations out there, but only one God," the
Santa Ana resident said. "We'll always be singing and dancing."</TE>

<HD>Work to Resume on Port of L.A. Terminal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge lifts order to halt construction in a blow to
coalition of environmentalists and residents that says plan ignores
public safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday rejected a request to stop construction of a
174-acre terminal in the Port of Los Angeles until a study of its
impact on health and safety could be completed.</LD>
<LD>   The request for a preliminary injunction against the China
Shipping Holding Co. Ltd. was filed by a coalition of community and
environmental groups that fears the project will generate dangerous
amounts of diesel emissions in neighboring San Pedro and Wilmington.</LD>
<LD>   Those communities already suffer from some of the worst big rig
congestion and highest concentrations of diesel emissions in the
region.</LD>
<TE>   The group claimed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated
federal law by permitting construction of the terminal's first wharf
without reviewing the cumulative impacts of the entire three-phase
project.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition's hopes were buoyed Tuesday when U.S. District Court
Judge Margaret Morrow issued a temporary restraining order to halt
construction of the terminal, even as work crews rushed to pour 100
feet of concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating a possible legal delay, port contractors have been
rushing to complete the project, which is about 60% finished.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow promised to rule Friday on whether to let work resume or to
extend the construction ban with a preliminary injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Port officials predicted that delays caused by a preliminary
injunction would cost the port about $1.2 million a month.</TE>
<TE>   Port authorities also feared delays would sully their reputation
as good business partners with some of the world's largest shipping
firms.</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling released early Friday evening, Morrow agreed with
points made by both sides but ultimately sided with the port on key
issues.</TE>
<TE>   While it was likely that the corps violated federal law by not
evaluating the project's cumulative impacts, she wrote, the
plaintiffs had not proved the public would be "sufficiently harmed"
by finishing the first wharf before environmental reviews could be
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Port of Los Angeles and China Shipping have said they
will conduct environmental reviews of the second and third phases
before starting to build them.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition attorney Gail Feuer of the Natural Resources Defense
Council said, "We are seriously considering appealing this ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn, whose district includes the area, did
not take issue with Morrow's ruling, but called the environmental
review of the second and third phases necessary. She warned that she
will keep a close eye on the project and "hold the port responsible
and accountable to the community throughout this entire project."</TE>
<TE>   The terminal, which is being built 500 feet away from San Pedro
homes, will include two wharves designed to handle 260 cargo ships
and 1.5 million 20-foot containers each year. Four of 10 new cranes
will stand 16 stories tall, blocking views of open water.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy erupted a year ago after the Los Angeles City
Council unanimously awarded China Shipping a $650-million lease
agreement on the property on the west side of the harbor just north
of San Pedro's Vincent Thomas Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who strongly supports China Shipping,
said at the time that failing to act promptly on the company's
request for a lease and permit would have scuttled the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor-area organizations initially filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles
County Superior Court against Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Harbor
Department and China Shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The state court ruled against the coalition, which includes the
Natural Resources Defense Council, San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners
Coalition, San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners United Inc. and the
Coalition for Clean Air.</TE>
<TE>   The group is appealing the state court ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Last April, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave China Shipping a
permit to build a 1,200-foot-long wharf after determining that it
would actually improve regional air quality by enhancing efficiency
in cargo handling in an existing industrial zone.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition challenged that permit in federal court on grounds
that the corps should have assessed the "cumulative" impact of the
entire three-phase project before allowing construction of the first
wharf to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Tonsich, president of the Board of Harbor Commissioners,
has called for a meeting with China Shipping officials to allay any
possible concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The terminal is being built on what is known as Berth 100. Chevron
USA used the area for seven decades as a crude oil tank farm with two
tanker wharves. As recently as 10 years ago, a portion of the
property was used as a shipyard.</TE>

<HD>State Nearing Deals to Redo Power Pacts</HD>
<DH>Energy: California will settle with five providers that
have agreed to ease terms of long-range contracts, a federal mediator
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California will drop its lawsuits and demands for refunds from
Williams Cos. under a settlement announced Friday by the troubled
energy trading company.</LD>
<LD>   Without releasing details, Williams said it had reached an
agreement in principle to rework its $3.8 billion worth of long-term
electricity contracts with California. In return, Williams would get
relief from the state's demand that it give back profits earned
during the electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis refused to confirm an agreement.</LD>
<TE>   "We have made it our policy never to comment on negotiations until
all the terms have been agreed upon and a renegotiated contract has
been signed by the parties," said Steven Maviglio, the governor's
press secretary.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal mediator trying to make peace between California
and energy companies said that a deal had been struck and could be in
writing by next week.</TE>
<TE>   "They have made a settlement in principle," said Curtis L. Wagner
Jr., chief of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's office of
administrative law. "They'll start the hard work of trying to reduce
it to writing."</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for the state and good for Williams," Wagner said. "I'm
very pleased."</TE>
<TE>   Four other energy companies have struck tentative agreements with
the state, he said, but do not want to make public announcements
until the commitments are in writing.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams agreement would be the second major power contract
renegotiation achieved by the state. In April, Davis announced the
overhaul of eight long-term energy contracts to save California
roughly $3.5 billion, or 23%. Those amended contracts include four
major deals with Calpine Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In a sharp turnabout from a year and a half ago, when energy
companies such as Williams appeared to be raking in cash from
California utilities, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Its
shares traded at $1.06 on Friday, down from a high of $34 earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Tulsa, Okla.-based company markets natural gas, other energy
products and the output of three Southern California power plants.
Williams Cos. has roughly $1 billion in cash and credit available and
a $650-million payment on debt due next week, said Carol Coale, an
analyst with Prudential Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Settling with California, she said, would help eliminate some
uncertainty for a potential buyer of Williams' trading operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Every power supplier out in California is probably going to have
to renegotiate their deals with [the state] and it's probably better
to just go ahead and get it done," Coale said.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner met with energy company officials for several days in
Sacramento this month. More talks are scheduled for Aug. 5 and 6 in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner is trying to mop up the mess left by the implosion of the
power market California launched in 1998 under an attempt at
deregulation. Exorbitant prices in that market drove the state's
biggest private utility to bankruptcy and forced a state agency--the
Department of Water Resources--to take over the job of buying
electricity for 27 million utility customers.</TE>
<TE>   Davis argues that power sellers such as Williams earned $9 billion
in excess profits in 2000 and 2001 and should be forced to give it
back by FERC, the nation's top arbiter of electricity sales.</TE>
<TE>   The governor and the California Public Utilities Commission also
argue that California deserves a $21-billion break on the $43 billion
worth of long-term contracts the state signed in the spring of 2001.
They say that the deals, some lasting 10 years, were signed at a time
when energy companies wielded illegal levels of control over power
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner has been trying to help California and the energy companies
find compromise on both the issues of refunds and long-term
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Williams President and Chief Executive Steve Malcolm said the
company had reached agreement with California, Washington and Oregon
on a "global settlement" that should result in a new power contract
with California. It would also resolve litigation against the
company, including a lawsuit by state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer
accusing Williams of violating state business laws.</TE>
<TE>   "The new long-term contracts will ensure that California consumers
will have power under more flexible terms and Williams will continue
to benefit from long-term power sales in the California market,"
Malcolm said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams signed four separate agreements with Water Resources
worth an estimated $3.8 billion over 10 years. Consumer advocates
have criticized the contracts as among the state's worst. The state
auditor concluded that the deals could expose the state to hundreds
of millions of dollars of increased costs by allowing Williams to
charge the state for compliance with air pollution laws.</TE>

<HD>Leader of Alleged Korean Prostitution Ring Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police are hunting the leader of a ring that allegedly lured young
women from South Korea to Los Angeles, where they were forced to work
as prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators say Joo Jong-Chang, 39, of Rowland Heights operated
a Koreatown gang that brought women illegally through Mexico and
Canada and then forced them to have sex with about a dozen customers
a day.</LD>
<LD>   Two suspected ring members, Lee Sun-Hwa, 30, and Kenith Park, 37,
were arrested July 5 and face charges of pimping, pandering and
kidnap for ransom.</LD>
<TE>   Police described Park as the ring's "strongman," ferrying the
women to and from customers and threatening them, sometimes with a
knife.</TE>
<TE>   The women were told "they could come to the United States and make
a lot of money," said LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish.</TE>
<TE>   "Once here, they were told that they had to be prostitutes in
order to pay off their debts," Kalish said.</TE>
<TE>   Police know of four women who say they were caught up in the
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that, once here, the women's money was taken away, and
the ring charged them for room and board and for condoms. Two of them
had been working as prostitutes since early January, the other two
since April.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish said one woman got pregnant, was forced to have an
abortion, and then ordered to work the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for immigrant women to be
exploited, to be brought into the country under false pretenses and
forced into becoming indentured servants," Kalish said.</TE>

<LD>A Newbury Park man who ran a Ventura auto body shop has pleaded
guilty to three counts of felony insurance fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Reiser, 58, was sentenced Thursday to 36 months of felony
probation, 30 days in Ventura County Jail and ordered to pay at least
$200 to a state restitution fund.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Mickey Coyle said the case began with a
citizen complaint about work done at Reiser's Buena Body Shop.</LD>
<TE>   Undercover investigators from the state's Bureau of Automotive
Repair brought two automobiles to the shop and found that about
$1,000 in repairs that were never performed were charged to insurance
companies, according to Coyle.</TE>

<HD>Tapes Tell Incomplete Tale of Police Beating</HD>
<DH>Inglewood: Security cameras, interviews fill in some
details of what happened at gas station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a pleasant day, sun shining, afternoon sliding into evening on
July 6 when Coby Chavis pulled his tan 1997 Ford Taurus into the
Thrifty gas station on Century Boulevard at Freeman Avenue in
Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   Chavis, a 41-year-old Inglewood man, is employed in construction
scaffolding and has a history of run-ins with police. He was, he
said, on his way to visit his father. With him was his son Donovan
Jackson, 16, a student at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours, Jackson's image would be flashed across the nation,
his body pictured being thrown across a police car, his face struck
hard with an officer's fist. Those images, which riveted Southern
California and reached to Washington and beyond, offered one part of
the story of Jackson's confrontation with Inglewood police.</LD>
<TE>   A fuller story emerges, however, from participants, police reports
and segments of videotape shot from various angles. In addition to
the widely broadcast tape by itinerant videographer Mitchell Crooks,
gas station security cameras shot photographs every three seconds;
some of those have been made public, others, still unreleased, have
been viewed by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Those accounts lend some credence to the police contention that
the televised blows to Jackson came after several minutes of
scuffling and raised tempers.</TE>
<TE>   But they also capture the incident's pivotal moment, when
Inglewood Officer Jeremy J. Morse threw the youth onto the police car
and punched him--and all accounts concur that Jackson was dazed and
in handcuffs when that happened.</TE>
<TE>   Morse has been indicted on felony assault charges; his partner,
Bijan Darvish, is charged with filing a false report.</TE>
<TE>   The events that left Jackson hurt and those two officers facing
the possibility of prison unfolded over roughly 11 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis stopped under the station's broad red-striped canopy to
draw gas from a pump in the northwest corner of the station. He sent
his son to pay. Jackson went into the station's closet-sized
mini-mart, where a cashier works in a steel-and-glass booth.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is slight, weighing 136 pounds. He is known to classmates
as quiet and easygoing, if a little slow academically. He was, in
fact, classified for special education on the basis of what his
family says is an "auditory processing disorder," which would mean he
doesn't easily understand what people say.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment that his father pulled into the station, though, his
family says, Donovan Jackson was a typically hungry teenager who had
a hankering for some potato chips. Inside the mini-mart, he picked a
bag from the small selection, paid and opened the door to return to
the car.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
were on their regular patrol.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrifty station lies on a heavily traveled commercial strip
between the Hollywood Park racetrack and Los Angeles International
Airport. Its neighbors are a humdrum mix of fast-food outlets, auto
repair shops and budget motels serving LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is in Inglewood, a patchwork of various police
cruisers typically plies Century Boulevard in front of the station,
which lies within a mile of three other jurisdictions: the cities of
Los Angeles and Hawthorne, and the unincorporated Lennox area, which
is patrolled by the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   It is not uncommon, officials say, for one agency to make a stop
in the other's territory. "Normal, routine stuff," said Assistant
Sheriff Dennis Dahlman, who worked the sheriff's Lennox area as a
patrolman for 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:02 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's cruiser passed the station, heading east on Century.
Noticing the Taurus, deputies rounded the block and pulled into the
station. Nothing in their report offers a hint about what drew their
attention. Dahlman, who has answered questions for the Sheriff's
Department about the case, said that issue remains under review.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the station and behind the Taurus, Deputies Carlos Lopez
and Daniel Leon noticed that the registration tag on the car's rear
license plate had expired in April. They ran a quick check of
Department of Motor Vehicle records, which confirmed that it was
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, Dahlman said, deputies who spot a recently expired
registration simply ask the driver to take care of it. But when Lopez
and Leon approached Chavis and asked for his driver's license, they
discovered another problem: His license, he said, had been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, meantime, had emerged from the mini-mart with his potato
chips; the gas station tape indicates that Jackson walked toward the
car at 5:02:39, carrying something in his left hand. According to
Chavis and lawyers for the family, the deputies saw the boy approach
and ordered him to drop the bag of chips.</TE>
<TE>   In his report after the incident, Lopez didn't mention any chips,
but said he asked the youth not to get back in his father's car.
Either way, the deputies didn't get what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson "stopped and faced me," Lopez wrote. "I noticed he was
breathing hard and had an angered facial expression." Jackson
mentioned that Chavis was his father, Lopez recalled. The deputy said
he told the boy "to hold on and allow us to finish what we were
doing." Jackson, he said, "stood outside of the vehicle intently
staring at me."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said later that he interpreted this as an indication of
defiance and anger. Jackson's family maintained that it was the
natural reaction of a frightened, perhaps panicked, teenager, whose
disability may have made it difficult for him to respond
appropriately to the deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Dahlman said Lopez "was just trying to get the kid out of the
problem." He added that Jackson "didn't seem to understand."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:05 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, according to Lopez, Leon told Chavis to get out of
his car, and the videotape shows him being led to the police car. The
deputy then began to pat down Chavis.</TE>
<TE>   As he did so, another deputy passed by, walking with Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the accounts begin to diverge. According to Chavis, Lopez
checked Jackson's pockets--apparently looking for weapons--and sat
him down in the patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   A few seconds later, Chavis said, his son stood up, drawn by the
sight of more officers approaching--the first of four Inglewood
officers who arrived in two squad cars. They pulled in, according to
Inglewood officials, to see if the deputies needed help. Lopez's
version of the searches of Jackson and his father differs from that
offered by Chavis. He says that while his partner was patting down
Chavis, Jackson "turned the left side of his body away from me and
placed his left hand in his left pocket." He then "moved his left
hand within his pocket as if he was manipulating something."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he asked Jackson if he had anything in his pocket, but
the youth didn't respond. "He continued looking at me as if he was
angry at me," he added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:06 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   From this moment, the situation rapidly went from tense to
violent, according to the tapes, officers and Jackson and Chavis.</TE>
<TE>   According to the deputy's report, Lopez asked Jackson to face the
Taurus and put his hands on the roof. Again, he didn't respond. So
Lopez said he began patting him down. Jackson's response now, he
said, was to tense up and refuse to obey orders to put his hands
behind his back. Lopez said he told him that he was just checking for
weapons and "it was not a big deal, and to relax."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson didn't relax.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Lopez said he decided he would have to hold the boy
in the patrol car while his partner completed the investigation of
Chavis.</TE>
<TE>   But that did not prove easy. Seconds after Jackson passed near his
father, the deputy patting down Chavis began to struggle; the two
fell to the ground and wrestled before officers succeeded in putting
Chavis in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Two Inglewood officers helped briefly with cuffing Chavis. In one
unreleased tape, one of the officers can be seen pausing over Chavis,
then suddenly looking up and hurrying toward Jackson and the officers
confronting him.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish reported the following exchange:</TE>
<TE>   "Have a seat in the car," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not getting in the car!" Jackson yelled.</TE>
<TE>   "We then saw Jackson's eyes open up very wide and begin to stare
at Deputy Lopez," Darvish wrote. "Jackson's nostrils then began to
flare and he started to breathe very heavily. Fearing that Jackson
was about to become combative, Officer Morse asked him to get in the
car, however, Jackson refused and continued to stare at Deputy Lopez.
Jackson then clenched both of his fists and raised his arms."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:07 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   According to an account written by the Jackson-Chavis Justice
Committee, a support group established soon after the incident,
Jackson had just stood up to watch the Inglewood police approach when
he was hit--unprovoked--by one of the officers, after which "other
officers began to hit Donovan all at once."</TE>
<TE>   That blow, if it occurred, is not definitively captured on tape.
Police reports and Chavis concur that officers knocked Jackson to the
ground, and one of the security camera sequences does show the youth
on the pavement as an officer jerks his arm quickly.</TE>
<TE>   From that point forward, the security cameras clearly depict a
scuffle.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis, in an interview long after the incident, said the
Inglewood officers "took turns beating [Jackson] in the face. My son
did nothing." During this pummeling--according to Joe Hopkins, who
briefly served as the father's attorney--one of the other officers
accidentally struck Morse in the head, causing him to bleed. One
officer, he said, then put his knee in Jackson's back.</TE>
<TE>   The officers, Hopkins said, then "slammed" Jackson onto the
pavement after picking him up by the seat of his pants. Morse, he
said, hit the boy twice with a closed fist.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials offer a significantly different account.
The versions presented by sheriff's deputies and Inglewood police are
not identical, though they generally parallel one another.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Deputy Lopez said Jackson "lunged at me, raising
his hands in front of him." Lopez said he crouched and tried to push
Jackson into the patrol car, but couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Darvish, slightly more specific, said Jackson had hit Lopez in the
upper chest and lower neck with both fists. Darvish added that he put
his hands on the back of Jackson's neck, and the three officers
managed to pull Jackson down.</TE>
<TE>   "As we were going to the ground," Darvish added, "Jackson was able
to free his arms from Officer Morse and Deputy Lopez."</TE>
<TE>   "As Officer Morse was pushing Jackson's hand away, the button on
his uniform broke off, causing Jackson to lose his grip," Darvish
continued. "Jackson then used his right hand and grabbed the top
portion of Officer Morse's left ear. Jackson then pulled his hand in
a downward motion, at which time Officer Morse felt a sharp pain on
the left side of [his] head."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Morse would be seen bleeding from below his left ear.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that Jackson was pulling him into a vulnerable position,
Darvish wrote, "I punched him two times in the face, using my right
hand."</TE>
<TE>   On the security tape, other Inglewood officers are visible in the
altercation with Jackson. And in a clearer view of that section of
the altercation, the scrum appears intense, with officers and Jackson
tumbling over one another.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, one Inglewood officer, Mariano Salcedo, grabbed Jackson
by the legs, Darvish wrote. The two deputies and Morse then turned
him onto his stomach--at this point, the two agencies' accounts
mesh--and handcuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:08 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Chavis and his supporters insist that Jackson did not struggle
during the tussle on the ground, and that the officers were the sole
aggressors. Moreover, Chavis said that one of the Inglewood officers
grabbed an 18-inch, silver-colored chain-link necklace that Jackson
was wearing and dragged the boy a foot or two by it until the chain
snapped under his weight. By then, he said, Jackson was unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   That is not visible on the gas station tape, but the gaps in the
action and the quality of the tape make it impossible to rule it out.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, Jackson's neck bore deep marks in the shape of
the chain.</TE>
<TE>   As officers and Jackson were struggling, Crooks was across the
street, relaxing in Room 215 of the Backpackers Paradise Hostel. He
heard a woman screaming that police were beating a man, and he jumped
to his feet, grabbing his video camera. Standing on his balcony, he
began filming.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks' tape begins just before 5:08 p.m. (the time code on his
camera is slightly different from the settings on the gas station
cameras). All the officers are gathered around Jackson, who on the
tape appears to be lying still on the ground, a moment also captured
from another angle by a gas station camera.</TE>
<TE>   In both views, Morse can be seen lifting the boy--who was so limp
as to appear unconscious--by the back of his pants and collar.
Crooks' video then shows Morse slamming the boy down, face first,
onto the trunk of the police cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   Morse then stood behind and over Jackson, whose dazed face hovered
just above the trunk. Darvish was next to Morse, with one hand on the
boy's back. Morse was holding Jackson's neck with his left hand.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, as Morse moved from Jackson's left to right, he briefly
released his hold on the boy's neck. After quickly reaching down
toward his own crotch, he reached back up and grabbed the boy's neck
again with his left hand. Darvish put a second hand on the boy's
back, apparently to help hold him down. Then Morse, grimacing,
slugged Jackson in the face with his right fist.</TE>
<TE>   It is for this behavior--the slam on the trunk and the punch to
the face--that Morse has been indicted. His defense so far has rested
on his allegation that Jackson, while slumped over the trunk, reached
back with his handcuffed hands and grabbed Morse's testicles,
squeezing them.</TE>
<TE>   Through that sequence, Morse was in and out of the video frame.
The tape does not show Jackson's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's contention that he was grabbed does not account, however,
for his action in slamming Jackson onto the car. Darvish's report
says only that the officers "assisted Jackson to his feet." Morse's
lawyer, John Barnett, said that was precisely what the officer was
doing when he picked up Jackson and slammed him down.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors evidently think otherwise: Darvish's description of
that sequence is what landed him an indictment for the felony of
filing a false police report.</TE>
<TE>   After Morse hit Jackson, the tape shows another officer,
apparently Salcedo, grabbing Morse by the arm and then using his own
arm as a wedge to separate Morse and Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5:11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo and Morse then marched the boy to the police car. He was
booked on suspicion of interfering with a police officer, but
prosecutors have decided not to charge Jackson with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the incident, much of the tape that recorded it is
silent. The security tape has no sound.</TE>
<TE>   But Crooks' tape is accompanied by voices. One is obviously that
of Crooks, the other that of the woman who alerted him to the
incident. While Jackson is still lying on the ground, surrounded by
the four Inglewood police officers and two sheriff's deputies, she
can be heard yelling--apparently to Jackson and his father--"Please,
you guys, do not resist them!"</TE>
<TE>   Then, in an aside, apparently to Crooks: "I just don't want this
boy to lose his life."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Crooks can be heard lamenting that he has filmed over
footage of his trip to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd better get money for it," he says.*</TE>

<HD>An Enlightening Account of Church's Sex Abuse Scandal</HD>
<DH>Betrayal: The Crisis in the Catholic Church; $23.95, 288
pages; Little, Brown and Co.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the annals of the Roman Catholic Church in America, there has been
no greater crisis in modern times than this year's sexual abuse
scandal. From its epicenter in Boston, shock waves rippled across the
country, reaching Los Angeles and other U.S. dioceses, toppling
priests from their pulpits and even retirements, and focusing
unprecedented popular anger at bishops themselves.</LD>
<LD>   If Boston was the epicenter, the seismic shock behind the tremor
was the Boston Globe. Its early-on investigative reporting and
perseverance in pursuing an ever-widening and shocking story in the
face of legal obstacles and ecclesiastical stonewalling uncovered a
scandal in its backyard that quickly became a national and
international story. Other media outlets soon followed.</LD>
<LD>   The Globe's reporting will likely be a contender for a Pulitzer
Prize next year. Now, eight members of the newspaper's investigative
staff have published the first and most complete accounting of this
year's events in a new book, "Betrayal: The Crisis in the Catholic
Church," overseen by Deputy Managing Editor Ben Bradlee Jr.</LD>
<TE>   By now, the story of the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic
priests and bishops is well-known, as are the attempts to cover it up
through out-of-court settlements, sealed court documents and quiet
transfers of abusive priests to new parishes where they harmed more
victims.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal is not thought to have run its full course. But
already Pope John Paul II has personally weighed in by declaring the
sexual abuse of minors not only a sin but also a civil crime. The
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, reacting to unprecedented
grass-roots pressure and public shame, last month in Dallas approved
tough new national sexual abuse prevention standards. The conference
is awaiting the Vatican's endorsement, which would make those
standards mandatory. In the meantime, most bishops say they are
voluntarily putting the standards into effect. A few continue to
wait.</TE>
<TE>   "Betrayal" is the journalists' account of the unfolding story. Its
value lies in bringing together in one place an overview of the
scandal, including the personal stories of abuser priests and their
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Special attention is focused on John J. Geoghan, now an ex-priest,
who over 34 years is accused of molesting upward of 200 minors as two
cardinal-archbishops transferred him from parish to parish. He is
serving a 9- to 10-year term in state prison after a conviction of
molesting one boy.</TE>
<TE>   There are details, too, of Father Paul Shanley, who was
recommended as a trustworthy priest by the Boston archdiocese to the
Diocese of San Bernardino, even though Boston knew about his record
of sexual abuse and that he attended a founding meeting of a national
man-boy love group.</TE>
<TE>   The book is more than a rewrite of previously published Globe
stories, and its narrative contains original reporting. While it does
not significantly advance the story or contain any new revelations,
it does place the scandal in a much-needed broader context often
missing from daily journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it looks beyond the immediate scandal and offers
enlightening, if brief, glimpses at the underlying factors that may
have contributed to the scandal, among them the clerical culture of
the Roman Catholic Church. It takes note, as did other media outlets,
of how the abuse scandal gave new force to long-simmering debates
over lay involvement and greater lay power within the church.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis also focused again on the wisdom of mandatory celibacy
for priests in the predominant Western or Latin Rite and the church's
prohibition against ordaining women and married men. There are
snippets of historical context that offer readers insight into the
reasons for its stance.</TE>
<TE>   In a large sense, the Boston scandal is about Cardinal Bernard
Law, the archbishop of Boston. It was Law who resisted early attempts
to address the problem on his watch. It was Law who in 1992 lashed
out against the Globe when it reported a case involving a pedophile
priest. "By all means, we call down God's power on the media,
particularly the Globe," he was reported as having said.</TE>
<TE>   Readers learn, too, of Law's aloofness and how he lost touch with
the pulse of Boston, one of the nation's most Catholic cities. Yet
Law also comes off as a thoughtful and compassionate priest and
bishop on issues not having to do with sexual abuse. He was a
crusading editor for civil rights on a Catholic newspaper in
Vicksburg, Miss., in the 1960s. In Boston, he championed affordable
housing and the causes of immigrants. He speaks fluent Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The book doesn't pretend to examine, as would a theologian or
scholar, the intricacies of the church dogma and disciplines. It is a
journalistic book written by journalists. It is based on solid
reporting. Yet its tone is not strictly "objective." It doesn't
merely present the facts and allow readers to draw their own
conclusions as "old school" journalism might. There is an
undercurrent of shock, outrage and breathlessness to the narrative
that at times goes beyond analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the book reflects the public anger and incredulity over how
things could have gone so far. "I never thought that a leading
facilitator for child abuse would be the church, where the church
would supply the victims and hide the perpetrators," one
Massachusetts state legislator and longtime Law supporter is quoted
as saying. "I understand why pedophiles do what they do. I still
can't understand, I still can't appreciate, how the church would do
this, how sophisticated and how diabolical this was. And how the
cardinal could preside over it."</TE>
<TE>   Given the gravity of the crimes and the helplessness and
vulnerabilities of the victims, there are times when journalism must
take a page from another school of thought and do more than merely
recount. As turn-of-the century crusading editor Finley Peter Dunne
once wrote, a newspaper "comforts the afflicted, afflicts the
comfortable." That is writ large in "Betrayal."</TE>

<HD>Mini-City in Oxnard Gets Key Approval</HD>
<DH>Growth: The Planning Commission votes to recommend the
2,800-home RiverPark development to City Council, and praises its use
of green space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaping over a crucial governmental hurdle, developers of Oxnard's
$750-million RiverPark mini-city have come a step closer to starting
construction late this summer.</LD>
<LD>   The city Planning Commission unanimously recommended approval of
the 2,800-home development Thursday night. The City Council will
consider it Aug. 27.</LD>
<LD>   "We crossed the finish line tonight," said developer Paul Keller,
who is partnering with David O. White in what would be the largest
project of its kind in Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   A heavily landscaped home and business development, the project
was praised by planning commissioners for its extensive use of green
space in neighborhoods and commercial areas. There are to be 10
parks, some with soccer and baseball fields, walking paths and
children's play areas. A reservoir would be created from old gravel
pits.</TE>
<TE>   Even affordable housing advocates, who initially were skeptical,
gave developers high marks for increasing low-income housing on the
site. When completed, as many as 27.5% of the homes in RiverPark
could be designated for people with low or moderate incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the type of project that speaks to the role we
need to play in the county," said Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an advocate
for affordable housing. "I will use this program as an example of a
development that houses workers."</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's homes would be clustered around community green
spaces. A town square would be bordered by shops and restaurants, a
convention center and 600-room hotel, and an exhibition hall.</TE>
<TE>   But developers said they have had no luck attracting a movie
theater because Ventura's Johnson Drive theater complex is too close
to the proposed multi-screen venue at RiverPark.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed commissioners urged them to continue trying because
Oxnard has no first-run theater and residents must travel to nearby
cities to see a new movie.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard has been trying for at least eight years to attract a
theater complex downtown to help revitalize the city's night-time
activities.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Commissioner Morey Navarro threatened to vote
against RiverPark if a theater was not included. He said he would
even help attract one.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you I can close a deal," Navarro said. "We're
basically building a brand new city ... it would seem we [should]
provide an avenue of entertainment for local people. If not, I think
we're missing the boat."</TE>
<TE>   Keller said RiverPark is still "very, very interested" in getting
a theater. The commission's vote Thursday specified that a theater
may be added to the plan in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Developers hope to break ground by late summer and open the first
of the project's five phases by 2004 after construction of a new
freeway interchange and the widening of the adjacent Santa Clara
River Bridge--a $100-million project that began in May.</TE>

<HD>Ed Runge, 84; Patriarch of Three-Generation Family of Major
League Umpires</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Runge, the patriarch of the only three-generation family of major
league baseball umpires, has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Runge, an American League umpire from 1954 through 1970, died
Thursday in San Diego, according to the commissioner's office. The
cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   His son Paul was a National League umpire from 1974-97 and then
became the league's executive director of umpires in 1998 and 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Paul Runge's son Brian joined the National League staff in 1999
and now is part of the major league staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only occupation where a man has to be perfect his first
day on the job and then improve over the years," Ed Runge said in
1973.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Runge became a professional umpire in 1947
in the Big State League and was promoted to the Pacific Coast League
in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to work the World Series in 1956, 1961 and 1967, the
All-Star games in 1955, 1959 and 1967, and the first American League
championship series in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   He threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the 1984
World Series, a game in which Paul Runge worked third base.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came to bat, Ed said to me, 'I don't know if you know my
strike zone; it's a wide plate,' " Tim McCarver, a broadcaster and
former catcher, once said.</TE>
<TE>   "I stored away the knowledge, not only for batting purposes, but

<TE>   Runge was the right field umpire at Yankee Stadium for Don
Larsen's perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956.</TE>
<TE>   With two outs in the fourth inning, Duke Snider hit a 2-0 fastball
over the fence in right field, and Runge called the ball foul--it
missed being a home run by about a foot. Larsen came back to throw a
called third strike past Snider.</TE>
<TE>   A complete list of Runge's survivors was not immediately
available.</TE>

<LD>The city of Oakland and Alameda County cannot find a company to

arena in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The city and county are struggling to pay off $140 million spent
on renovations five years ago.</LD>

<LD>Leigh Bailey, on loan to the San Fernando Valley secession campaign
from its better-funded sister effort in Hollywood, is standing in the
only spot of shade in the center of a flat, wide Valley park.</LD>
<LD>   There, the campaign worker says, pointing to the very center of
the sun-baked meadow, will be red-white-and-blue bunting, kids in
towering Uncle Sam hats and, on a big easel, a declaration of
independence for the San Fernando Valley, ready for signing.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that the founding fathers orchestrated their
declaration in Philadelphia, and that some pretty interesting people
showed up, such as Benjamin Franklin and John Adams. Valley
secessionists are hoping to attract an equally impassioned bunch this
morning, when they gather in Van Nuys to offer a declaration of their
own.</LD>
<TE>   "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bonds that connect them with
another," they will intone, with words that both echo and embellish
those of that great declaration at Independence Hall.</TE>
<TE>   They go on to list their grievances: "The City of Los Angeles has
provided no major museums in the Valley. The Valley has half the
number of libraries as have been located in the remainder of Los
Angeles. The Valley is without a mass transit system.... We have for
decades petitioned for redress of these inequities."</TE>
<TE>   It's all part of the shoestring campaign to wrest the San Fernando
Valley from Los Angeles come November.</TE>
<TE>   Today's event, the group's first real rally and its first big
effort to attract the media, is meant to celebrate what secessionists
view as a historic victory this week, when the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors officially placed a measure on the Nov. 5 ballot
that would create a new Valley city. A similar measure regarding
Hollywood won its place on the ballot Friday; secessionists there
held a similar "declaration" event weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   As secessionists struggle to regain campaign momentum after
several weeks of setbacks, they are busy planning more events like
the one today in Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, pro-secession forces will hold an "independence ball,"
featuring roving mariachis and a Filipino big band to showcase the
diversity of the Valley. On Aug. 10, they will kick off the fall
campaign season early, with a rally for volunteers and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Their hoped-for comeback will be tightly budgeted. By their
accounting, secessionists have raised about $300,000, most of it from
their own members. They will be fighting what's expected to be a
massive effort led by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, which has
raised about $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done this whole thing on a shoestring," said Jeff Brain,
president of the pro-secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the group's two-year campaign to change state law so
that secession could go on the ballot was $5,700, Brain said. Today's
party, according to Bailey, cost $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   As in those efforts, the group plans to rely on volunteers and
word of mouth to spread the secession message. In coming weeks,
secession proponents say, they will organize phone banks at borrowed
offices and hold four recruiting meetings a week in different parts
of the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have limited funds, it becomes very important to
organize your volunteer effort conscientiously," said Laurette
Healey, co-chairwoman of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   If more money becomes available, the campaign may be able to
afford mailers and broadcast advertising, but those wouldn't come
until later in the fall, said Frank Schubert, the committee's
political consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Steinberg, a political strategist who advised some early
backers of secession, said he is not certain whether the planned
events will give the campaign the boost the separatists hope for.</TE>
<TE>   Today's event, he said, could generate media coverage,
particularly from the story-hungry Saturday television news programs.
But other events and the recruitment efforts may be too late, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, the wording of the secessionists' "declaration
of independence," which quotes liberally from the real thing, is
"hyperbolic overstatement that probably trivializes the issues that
need to be discussed."</TE>
<TE>   A USC political scientist, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, said the planned
events could help renew the campaign. But the effort could also
backfire, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to create an image of motion," Jeffe said. "But
there's a risk. What if they have all these events and no people show
up?"</TE>

<HD>Complaint Paints Desperate Picture of Blaze Suspect</HD>
<DH>Sequoia: Woman allegedly used drugs, stalked husband before
setting campfire that grew out of control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX and BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>In the hours before she lighted a campfire that, so far, has burned
62,000 acres of the Sequoia National Forest, Peri Van Brunt allegedly
smoked methamphetamine and stalked her estranged husband, following
him to the Roads End Resort near where the fire started last Sunday,
according to a federal criminal complaint filed here Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A tearful Van Brunt, 45, appeared in U.S. District Court on
charges of setting the fire "willfully and without authority." The
complaint painted a portrait of a desperate woman who was nursing an
injured eye and trying to patch up a rocky marriage marred by years
of drug abuse.</LD>
<LD>   But Van Brunt was not accused of purposefully starting the
so-called McNally fire to get back at her husband. Nor was there
evidence presented that the Bakersfield woman was under the influence
of drugs at the time the fire started.</LD>
<TE>   By late Friday, firefighters were sounding optimistic about the
blaze, although it was still only 30% contained and flames were
within half a mile of the Packsaddle Grove of giant sequoias.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was making the most headway to the north toward the
Golden Trout Wilderness and to the southeast, near Poison Meadow and
Cherry Hill Road. Helicopters were making water drops in the
southeast. Some personnel were being shifted to the north. On the
east, fire engines were sent in to protect cabins at Bonita Meadows,
near Sherman Pass.</TE>
<TE>   "This is looking a lot better today," said Karen Giullen, a
spokeswoman for the California Department Forestry. "I think today
went very well.... We still continue to have a few problems, but
things are looking better."</TE>
<TE>   Giullen, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry,
said firefighters were holding their own along a cleared strip
between the fire and Pack Saddle.</TE>
<TE>   "The line is in place and it's a good line. We have personnel, air
and ground support, and we're hoping [the fire] just comes up and
bumps that line and stops there."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, in their case against Van Brunt
say she made the mistake of building a campfire without a permit and
failing to adequately clear out brush--enough to charge her with a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The requirements for a permit and the requirements on how to
conduct yourself in a national forest, they are there for a reason,"
said Assistant U.S. Atty. Carl Faller. "When folks don't follow those
regulations, appropriate action will be taken."</TE>
<TE>   Van Brunt, who is being held in Fresno County Jail without bail
until a hearing next week, was required to neither enter a plea nor
speak. Her left eye was still black and blue, an injury that Faller
said took place before the fire, although he would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Her feet and hands bound in chains, she bit her lower lip and
tried to hold back tears. As she was led out of the courtroom, she
smiled at her teenage son and a female relative who shooed off
reporters, saying only that the fire was unintentional. "I know it
was an accident," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In an affidavit filed as part the criminal complaint, U.S. Forest
Service Special Agent Phillip Stewart said the wildfire began at 2
p.m. Sunday near the Roads End Resort beside the Kern River in the
Cannell Meadow Ranger District.</TE>
<TE>   He said employees of the resort were confronted a few moments
later by a woman with blond hair and a bruised left eye, screaming
that she had started a wildfire and did not know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who was accompanied by a tan-and-white boxer dog, then
drove off in a beat-up white pickup, according to the affidavit.
Three days later, Gary Van Brunt, the estranged husband who was
staying at the resort at the time, contacted police. He told
authorities that the description of the woman who allegedly started
the fire matched that of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "He said [on the day of the fire] he saw his wife walking toward
the resort from a campsite that the two of them had used for several
years," the affidavit states. "In the years they camped there, they
had always obtained fire permits and properly cleaned the area around
the campfire.</TE>
<TE>   "He stated that he had been at the resort in order to avoid his
estranged wife. He contended [she] was stalking him and ... he was
seeking a restraining order."</TE>
<TE>   Agent Stewart said he then tracked down Peri Van Brunt at her home
in Bakersfield and she acknowledged that she had started the fire and
was going to turn herself in.</TE>
<TE>   "She admitted that she did not have a campfire permit prior to
starting her campfire," the affidavit states. "She also admitted to
having smoked methamphetamine the night before she traveled to the
resort."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Van Brunt faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Three much smaller wildfires burned inside and next to the Klamath
National Forest near the Oregon border Friday. One of them was
contained and the other two were not spreading rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   The largest of the three was the so-called Stanza fire, about 10
miles southeast of Happy Camp on the Klamath River. Forest Service
officials said steep terrain and increasing winds were hampering
efforts to control the fire, which had burned about 350 acres by
Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   A 60-acre blaze was burning through rugged backcountry near the
community of Klamath River, about 15 miles west of Interstate 5.
Officials did not expect full containment before tonight or Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   On the east side of the national forest, crews contained a 75-acre
fire near the town of Dorris on Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Another blaze, in Yosemite National Park, was extinguished before
dawn Friday after blackening about 15 acres on the shoulder of Half
Dome.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles street gang member was sentenced Friday to life in
prison without the possibility of parole for murdering the
granddaughter of former LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks one week before
her 21st birthday.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Sharad Shabazz, 20, was convicted earlier this month of
first-degree murder in the shooting death of Lori Gonzalez, a
bystander caught between two gangs.</LD>
<LD>   Shabazz fired into a vehicle that Gonzalez was driving and hit her
instead of her passenger, the intended victim.</LD>
<TE>   At an emotional court hearing, the victim's mother, Felicia Parks
Mena, displayed photographs of Gonzalez and told Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Robert J. Perry that it was hard to go on.</TE>
<TE>   She pleaded with gang members to put down their guns.</TE>
<TE>   "A mother's cry for her dead child is like no other," she said.
"Stop killing our babies."</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Parks, who sat next to his wife during the hearing,
did not address the judge but said later, outside the courtroom, that
he had attended both as a parent and as a grandparent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that no one should go through," he said.
"Closure does not come, but certainly justice was served today.</TE>
<TE>   "Closure will never come because Lori will never return."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez was shot on May 28, 2000, in the parking lot of a
fast-food restaurant in southwest Los Angeles when Shabazz approached
her car and fired at her childhood friend, Ernest Gray. He missed
Gray, a member of a rival gang, and hit Gonzalez in the chest and
head.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, Gray and other eyewitnesses testified
against Shabazz. Prosecutors argued that Shabazz, a West Boulevard
Crip, had shot at the car in retaliation for another gang shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys maintained that the photographs used to identify
Shabazz had been flawed because he had been the only dark-skinned
male pictured.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors convicted Shabazz on July 3 of killing Gonzalez, and
determined that he had committed the murder to benefit the gang.</TE>
<TE>   They also found him guilty of eight other attempted murders,
including four shootings in 1998, and acquitted him of a ninth
attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the judge denied a motion for a new trial before
sentencing Shabazz to the life term without possibility of parole and
eight additional life sentences for the attempted murder convictions.
He also ordered Shabazz to pay a $10,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz, wearing an orange jail suit and shackles, looked straight
ahead during sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by the judge whether he wanted to say anything, Shabazz
declined.</TE>
<TE>   His mother sat in the back row of the courtroom, behind two rows
of Gonzalez's family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, a recent beauty school graduate, was working two jobs at
the time of the shooting. Her parents said she loved listening to
music, going to church and taking pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "Lori was a student of life," her father, Joe Gonzalez, said in
court.</TE>
<TE>   She lived in Orange County, but visited friends and relatives in
Los Angeles regularly.</TE>
<TE>   The murder moved Parks Mena to become involved in support and
advocacy for parents of murdered children.</TE>
<TE>   Several other women who had lost children attended Friday's
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Lori was murdered the same way as our children," said Anna Del
Rio, whose daughter was killed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "She was gunned down on the streets of Los Angeles. We're here to
support the family."</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Joe Gonzalez said he is just one of many parents
who has lost a child to gun violence.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped that his daughter's death "may inspire somebody
to put their gun down and talk instead of shoot."</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raising Struggle Leaves Simon With $5 Million on Hand</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Despite $16.4million gathered in the first half
of 2002, the GOP candidate is far behind Davis, who has a
$31.6-million war chest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and JEFFREY RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Relying heavily on help from the Simon family and President Bush,
Republican Bill Simon Jr. on Friday reported raising $16.4 million
toward his bid for California governor in the first half of this
year. He had $5 million in the bank as of June 30.</LD>
<LD>   Both figures paled beside the amounts reported by incumbent
Democrat Gray Davis, and the showing increased concern within GOP
circles about the financial strength of Simon's effort.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has raised more than $50 million since taking office in
January 1999, and he reported $31.6 million in the bank as of June
30, the close of the most recent reporting period. By contrast, Simon
has collected $22.1 million since announcing his candidacy.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement issued with his campaign report, Simon sought to
turn Davis' money advantage against the governor. "For the past four
years, Gray Davis has built a campaign war chest by putting his
reelection campaign ahead of the needs of Californians," Simon said.
"His campaign account is full, but the state's treasury is empty."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the figures offered a stark outline of the challenge Simon
faces unseating an incumbent governor--even one as personally
unpopular as Davis. It has been 60 years since a California governor
has been denied a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a decent showing, but it's not overwhelming," Republican
strategist Ken Khachigian said of Simon's fund-raising performance.
"It's got to be improved."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the latest figures were released, GOP insiders were
fretting about the financial wherewithal of Simon's campaign. Those
worries increased earlier this week with the public glimpse at his
tax returns, which suggested that Simon is not nearly as wealthy as
many had supposed. That, in turn, raised doubts about whether Simon
will invest the tens of millions of dollars that strategists hinted
at when he entered the governor's race as a longshot last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon team released a summary Friday of contributions to its
campaign during the latest reporting period, Feb. 17 to June 30. The
campaign collected $11.8 million in that time. Simon made $2.7
million in new loans to his campaign, bringing his total investment
in his candidacy to $5 million. Since winning the primary, however,
he has made no more contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Simon faces a quandary: If he taps his personal fortune again, he
may discourage other donors. If he does not--and fails to
significantly improve his fund-raising--he risks effectively ceding
the television airwaves to Davis, who has been advertising nonstop
for the last seven weeks.</TE>
<TE>   To date, Bush has been Simon's biggest asset outside of his own
family. The president raised almost $5 million for the GOP nominee
during a fund-raising swing in April and plans to return for more
events in August.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's brother and five sisters have contributed hundreds of
thousands more to the campaign, making the family's money crucial to
the candidacy's continued viability. The family-owned investment
banking firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons, has also given $50,000 in
recent months, according to a Times analysis of large contributions
reported to the California secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis shows that the New Majority PAC--a group of moderate
Orange County Republicans that backed former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan in the primary--has given $200,000 to Simon since
March 5, to become his second-largest donor.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton-based developer A.G. Spanos has given $151,405 since Jan.
1. Joseph Coors of the Coors brewing family provided $123,000, and
Simon's sister, Aimee S. Bloom, was the campaign's fifth-largest
donor at $105,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 10 contributors have donated $100,000 to Simon in the
first half of the year. They include Univision Chairman Jerry
Perenchio, who has also given substantially to Davis; H.F. Boeckmann
III, a Galpin Motors executive and son of San Fernando Valley
secession leader Bert Boeckmann; Los Angeles business executives
Frank E. Baxter and B. Wayne Hughes; Los Angeles investor David H.
Murdock; the Republican National Committee; and the Lincoln Club of
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Davis released his report earlier this month, showing that he had
raised about $14 million during the first six months of the year.
Without collecting another cent, the governor now has more than
enough money to finance $1.5 million worth of weekly TV advertising
for the rest of the campaign, the amount that political professionals
say is necessary to catch the attention of notoriously disengaged
California voters.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, on a separate matter, Simon and his staff reiterated
that the candidate's tax returns would remain under wraps for the
rest of the campaign, declining a request for a follow-up review.
Simon let reporters peruse the materials for a limited time Monday.</TE>

<DH>Shooting: The discovery of the victim's body in Ventura
sparks an unsuccessful search for a man who witnesses say ran from
the scene.</DH>

<LD>A 22-year-old Port Hueneme woman was shot and killed in Ventura on
Friday, sparking a daylong search for the gunman that stretched from
the Buenaventura Golf Course across the dry bed of the Santa Clara
River and into Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Police initially responded to a call of a car accident in the 3000
block of Bunsen Avenue, an area of industrial parks and empty fields.</LD>
<LD>   When they arrived just after 8:30 a.m., they found Irene Imelda
Mata shot in the head and slumped in the front passenger seat of a
white Camaro, said Ventura Police Lt. Doug Auldridge. The Camaro had
apparently rear-ended a blue van, which witnesses said had been
abandoned on the street several weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Camaro was registered to a Ventura woman.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that a man in his 20s, about 6 feet tall and
wearing a white shirt and brown pants, ran from the scene, prompting
the search.</TE>
<TE>   Assisted by a bloodhound, an army of uniformed police officers,
investigators and SWAT team members fanned out in the area during an
eight-hour search for the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   A Ventura County sheriff's helicopter also assisted.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators combing the area near the crime scene found a gun
that they believe was used in the shooting, the 14th homicide in
Ventura County this year.</TE>
<TE>   Police tracked the suspect south, through the Buenaventura Golf
Course, across the riverbed and through the River Ridge Golf Course.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, officers found two window screens at a nearby hotel
that appeared to have been pried open in an attempt to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Later, officers searched door-to-door through nearby
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests were made. Police declined to name a suspect and said
they were still trying to sort out details about the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy is scheduled for 9 a.m. today, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Annie Snyder, 80; Fought to Preserve Manassas, Va.,
Battlefield and Environs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Annie Snyder, the Virginia farmer and World War II Marine Corps
veteran who led major campaigns against Marriott Corp., Walt Disney
Co. and other developers in her decades-long battle to preserve land
near the Manassas Civil War battlefield, has died. She was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Snyder, who had diabetes and heart problems, died July 19 of
pneumonia at Prince William Hospital in Manassas, Va.</LD>
<LD>   A conservative Republican, Snyder began leading political crusades
in Prince William County not long after she and her airline pilot
husband, Pete, moved to their 180-acre farm near Gainesville after
World War II.</LD>
<TE>   The farm, on which Snyder raised strawberries and Black Angus
cattle, lies just east of Manassas National Battlefield Park, where
Union and Confederate troops clashed in two major Civil War battles.
(The Battles of Manassas were known by Northerners as the Battles of
Bull Run.)</TE>
<TE>   Battle of the Interstate</TE>
<TE>   The first of what Snyder called her many "battles of Manassas" to
preserve the historic ground began in the 1950s when she successfully
fought federal highway engineers who wanted to build an interstate
through the middle of the battlefield about 30 miles west of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, she led a campaign that forced Marriott to abandon
its proposal to build a Great America theme park on nearby land.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, she and other preservationists--most prominently
the National Trust for Historic Places and historians David
McCullough and Shelby Foote--worked to thwart Disney's plans to build
an American history theme park, housing, shops and hotels on 3,000
acres about four miles from the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   In surrendering, Disney executives acknowledged that the national
debate over the $650-million project damaged the company's image.</TE>
<TE>   But the battle that made her an internationally known
preservationist came in 1988 when the developer of a "campus-like"
540-acre residential-retail-office complex dropped a bombshell two
years after receiving approval by announcing that the centerpiece of
the project would be a 1.2-million-square-foot mall.</TE>
<TE>   The site for the mall was Stuart's Hill, the ridge where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee directed his troops to victory at the
Second Battle of Manassas in 1862.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists were aghast.</TE>
<TE>   "Another piece of America's heritage is about to be taken away
from us forever," Snyder said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The media jumped on the story, their cameras capturing bulldozers
and chainsaws as construction crews worked around the clock on the
site.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder led the charge, launching the Save the Battlefield
Coalition, which grew to include more than 120 history and
preservation groups. They gathered more than 80,000 petition
signatures and won the backing of several congressional leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Jody Powell, a descendant of nine Manassas veterans and onetime
press secretary for President Carter, joined up as a tactician and
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   During a congressional hearing, Powell made an impassioned speech
in which he referred to that "blood-soaked piece of Virginia
countryside" where "history is palpable." As he spoke, the network
news cameras focused on Snyder sitting next to him, tears streaming
down her face.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Congress approved spending $120 million to buy the
land and President Reagan signed the legislation, which saved the
site from development.</TE>
<TE>   To her foes over the decades, Snyder was "selfish," a "crackpot,"
and a "real environmental nut" who cost the county dearly in tax
revenue and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been anti-growth," Snyder told the Washington Post in
1984. "That's unrealistic. What I am against is destroying natural
resources that are irreplaceable in the name of growth."</TE>
<TE>   Born Elizabeth Anne Delp in Pittsburgh, Snyder was the daughter of
a prosperous attorney. She entered Allegheny College at 16 and
graduated with a degree in English and history at 19. She was
attending law school at the University of Pittsburgh in 1943 when she
dropped out to join the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   'Mollie Marine'</TE>
<TE>   Among the first female officers in that branch of the armed
forces, Snyder was one of five women in the Corps to serve as models
for the "Mollie Marine" statue, the nation's first monument to women
in uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Dedicated Nov. 10, 1943, it stands on Canal Street in New Orleans,
where Snyder first worked as a recruiter before traveling around the
nation seeking female recruits. She was working in the
quartermaster's office at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia
when she met the Marine pilot who would become her husband.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the Snyders moved to their rural property, where
Annie raised six children and ran the farm and cattle operation while
her husband flew for the airlines. In her spare time, she became
Prince William County's most prominent civic activist.</TE>
<TE>   The upstairs study in her home was filled with cabinets and
cardboard boxes from her many battles against proposed road
improvements, bond issues and developments. She also was an early
fighter for civil rights and better schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I have kept up on everything that goes on in this county," she
told the Washington Post in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The battles also earned her many enemies, something she viewed
with pride.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet I'm the only woman you know who's going to have a bouncer
at her funeral," she once joked to a reporter. "I've already arranged
to keep my enemies out who are going to want to come and dance on my
grave."</TE>
<TE>   She added with a chuckle, "You know, friends come and go, but
enemies are forever."</TE>
<TE>   Snyder is survived by her husband of 57 years; her six children;
six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Stand Down Reveals Battles Won and Lost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Frymann is a Stand Down success story.</LD>
<LD>   After four years of attending the three-day event designed to help
veterans break the cycle of homelessness, Frymann has a job
installing satellite dishes, shares a home with the woman he loves
and is clean of alcohol and drugs. He has returned to the Stand Down
for the past two years as a volunteer, handing out clothes to the
homeless.</LD>
<LD>   But for every Ray Frymann, there is a Spider.</LD>
<TE>   Spider was able to get off the streets thanks to help he received
at the Stand Down in 1993. But to the dismay of organizer Claire
Hope, Spider was spotted this year in line at the Stand Down to get a
free lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "It is discouraging," Hope said with a sigh. "We try to get them
transitional housing, give them detox if they need it." But some may
never be able to get off the streets, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Stand down" is a military phrase referring to the movement of
exhausted combat units from battlefields to a place of relative
safety. The Ventura County Stand Down, held annually at Ventura
College, is an intervention program that gives homeless veterans
access to medical treatment, legal services, employment counseling
and referrals, Veterans Affairs benefits and drug counseling.</TE>
<TE>   During the Stand Down, the college's football field is transformed
into a temporary barracks--with green military tents set up as
sleeping quarters. Flags representing each branch of the military are
displayed on the field, in front of a makeshift stage.</TE>
<TE>   Friday morning, tunes from the '60s served as the soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the social services available, veterans can get a
haircut, pick up new toiletries and acquire a fresh set of clothing.
And unlike previous years, volunteers expect to outfit every one of
the expected 200 veterans with a new pair of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, Hope says, is to give needy veterans many of the tools
they need to make it on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not have veterans sleeping on the streets of America,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But as Spider and other attendees illustrate, three days may not
be long enough to make a permanent difference. Which is
understandable, many of the event's 300 volunteers say.</TE>
<TE>   "What tends to happen is that there are only a small portion [of
veterans] who don't come back. It can take four or five years to
break the cycle," said Coast Guard Lt. Col. Mary Gene Ryan, who
organized medical services for the event. "Most volunteers understand
that, especially the medical people. Some [veterans] may never break
the cycle."</TE>
<TE>   Frymann testifies to how hard it can be. He attended the first
Stand Down in 1993 and found the services helpful, but he now admits
that he wasn't ready to change.</TE>
<TE>   "I got some good advice, and I started out on the road to try to
straighten out my life," Frymann said. "But for some reason, every
time I'd try to straighten out, I'd catch up with old friends and get
in trouble again."</TE>
<TE>   He moved off the streets four years ago and got his current job
two years ago. Today, retired Chief Master Sgt. Jesse Dunlap of
Camarillo, the Stand Down chairman for clothing, is glad to count
Frymann among his volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're hoping is that one day, we'll open the door and nobody
will come through the door--they'll all have gone out and gotten
jobs," said Dunlap, a 30-year Air Force veteran. "But that's not
going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   The effort remains important, however, as evidenced by the number
of volunteers, the hours of planning and the year-round donations.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans get the camaraderie that comes with being around others
who have shared their experiences and understand their plight. One
volunteer said the Stand Down has a family atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are living in the trenches," said Junior Garcia, an
Air Force veteran and advocate for the homeless. "This is three days
of not being harassed by the elements, of not worrying about the cops
busting them. "</TE>
<TE>   But there is more that can be done, Garcia said, speaking
wistfully about a planned homeless shelter in Ventura and a veterans
home that is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   "After these three days, where do they go?" Garcia asked.</TE>
<TE>   Frymann will be going home. But he will be back for the next Stand
Down, he vows.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed me that there were people who cared whether I lived
or died. They showed me that was another way to go," he said.
"Because they helped me, it's my turn to repay the favor."</TE>

<HD>Language Course Sign-Ups Lagging</HD>
<DH>Education: Orange County's Vietnamese community lobbied for

<LD>Student interest in Vietnamese language programs at two Garden Grove
high schools has been below expectations, forcing school officials to
scramble to save classes added to the curriculum after years of
lobbying from Vietnamese parents and community leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The language classes at Bolsa Grande and La Quinta high schools
are two-thirds full, prompting school officials and civic leaders to
hit Little Saigon radio stations, local newspapers and community
bulletin boards to drum up interest in the foreign-language
electives.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we need to publicize the course again," said Bolsa Grande
Principal Denise Jay.</LD>
<TE>   Second-generation Vietnamese who want to learn the native language
of their parents have created a surge in Vietnamese language classes
in high schools.</TE>
<TE>   But Bolsa Grande's beginner Vietnamese course has just 18 of the
30 students required for a full class. La Quinta's 30-student class
is full.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the two high schools must enroll at least 60 total students
in the pilot classes or the program could be canceled, school
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents, students, teachers, school officials and politicians who
have fiercely backed the programs said the courses are a necessity
for the Garden Grove Unified School District, which serves the
largest Vietnamese American student population in the nation--28% of
the student body, or about 11,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   They are hoping for a higher turnout when underclass students
register in August.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the program is poorly organized, leaving no
assurances for success and too much to chance as pilot classes, even
for interested parents and students.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that the pilot classes might not be successful,
because at this point I don't know what the district has done to
ensure the program's continued success," said KimOanh Nguyen-Lam of
Garden Grove, whose eighth-grade son, Elliot, will attend high school
a year from now. "The class might be dropped by the time my son gets
to La Quinta in ninth grade."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen-Lam said she's hesitant about signing her son up for the
pilot classes because the schools don't evaluate the students'
proficiency level, and the volunteer teachers aren't given
supplemental training to teach language classes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those concerns, community support for the classes remains
strong.</TE>
<TE>   Much like French, German or Spanish electives, the Vietnamese
course is open to all students and fulfills high school and college
language requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "I have every belief that the pilot classes will be a successful
endeavor and more schools will want it," said Garden Grove board
member Lynn Hamtil.</TE>
<TE>   The more languages schools offer, the brighter the future Huong Le
sees for her children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good, because my children can learn more languages and they
can have better opportunities," said Le of Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   "But nothing can compare or be more satisfying and precious to me
than to have my children sit down with me and have a conversation
entirely in Vietnamese. I wish for that."</TE>

<TE>   Despite those concerns, community support for the classes remains
strong.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to stay with this issue," said Sen. Joe Dunn
(D-Garden Grove), who helped spearhead a grass-roots campaign to
develop the programs. "I think it's about time. I was shocked to
discover as of the late 1990s that there was no ability for a
Vietnamese American student to learn Vietnamese as a foreign-language
option at their high school."</TE>
<TE>   Much like French, German or Spanish electives, the Vietnamese
course is open to all students and fulfills high school and college
language requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "I have every belief that the pilot classes will be a successful
endeavor and more schools will want it," said Garden Grove board
member Lynn Hamtil. "We have no short-term or long-term expectations
other than we hope there are enough students interested to make it
worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of Vietnamese as a foreign language course was raised by
parents in the mid-1980s. For years, the district maintained a
position that there wasn't enough student interest to warrant a
program, Dunn said.The issue was raised again in 1999. Critics say
the district has been largely unresponsive and slow to act despite
letters, student petitions, calls and e-mails from the community.</TE>
<TE>   'Misperceptions' Gone</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that there were members of the community who
felt that the mostly Anglo administration of Garden Grove district
resisted their request because racism was at the core of the
resistance by the district," Dunn said. "All those misperceptions
vanished when we--myself, community leaders and the
superintendent--finally met face-to-face to voice our concerns."</TE>
<TE>   District officials said adding language courses is a difficult
task that requires an overhaul of schedules, finding qualified
teachers and proper textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "If parents say the district is slow, then it's because they
didn't know who they needed to contact and notify to initiate the
class," said Hamtil. "Once we found out about six to eight months ago
that we could offer the course, we approved it. The process is slow,
but in education nothing is instant."</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta and Bolsa Grande high schools had to draft course
proposals, readjust class loads and recruit from its full-time,
bilingual teaching staff to find a qualified and willing teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Timing and support from the district is crucial to the survival of
a language program, said Anji Clemens, assistant principal in charge
of curriculum at Westminster High School, which in 1999 became the
first school in Orange County to start a Vietnamese program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long and laborious process that most people don't fully
understand," Clemens said. "I see the foreign language course as a
college requirement that students must take and parents and people in
the community see it as an emotional, cultural thing to preserve the
language and heritage of their parents and grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   Westminster's first Vietnamese program had 80 students and
included native and nonnative Vietnamese students. Last year's class
had 105 students and includes advanced-level courses, Clemens said.</TE>
<TE>   Jay and Clemens want to develop a more comprehensive Vietnamese
foreign language program to include up to four levels of proficiency,
on par with more traditional foreign-language electives.</TE>
<TE>   The more languages schools offer, the brighter the future Huong Le
sees for her children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good, because my children can learn more languages and they
can have better opportunities," said Le of Garden Grove. "But nothing
can compare or be more satisfying and precious to me than to have my
children sit down with me and have a conversation entirely in
Vietnamese."</TE>

<HD>Lord Arnold Weinstock, 77; Led Growth of Firm GEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lord Weinstock, who transformed GEC into one of Britain's most
successful postwar industrial groups, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Weinstock died Tuesday at his home in Wiltshire, southwest
England, a family spokesman said. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Weinstock joined Radio &amp; Allied Industry, the family firm of his
father-in-law, Michael Sobell, in 1954. It became GEC after a 1961
takeover, and Weinstock became managing director in 1963.</LD>
<TE>   After 33 years at the helm, Weinstock retired in 1996, having
built one of Britain's most successful manufacturing empires, which
had some 2 billion pounds (or about $3 billion) in cash resources.</TE>
<TE>   Through a string of takeovers, GEC had come to dominate Britain's
engineering, electronics and telecommunications industries. Its
interests included military equipment, refrigerators, gasoline pumps
and telephone exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstock was famous for his grasp of detail, caution in business
and tightfisted management of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Born Arnold Weinstock in 1924, he was the youngest of six children
of Polish parents who immigrated to London in 1904. He married Netta
Sobell in 1949, after receiving a degree at the London School of
Economics.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstock and Sobell owned racehorses together from 1957, and in
1960, they bought Ballymacoll Stud in County Meath, Ireland, breeding
successful horses.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstock, who was knighted in 1970 and made a life peer 10 years
later, was a former trustee of the British Museum and the Royal
Philharmonic Society.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife and a daughter.</TE>

<HD>Ft. Bragg Evaluates String of Killings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FT. BRAGG, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Four Army wives at Ft. Bragg have been killed over the last six
weeks, allegedly by their husbands, prompting the Army to announce
Friday it will reevaluate the base's family counseling program.</LD>
<LD>   "It's mind-boggling," said Henry Berry, manager of family advocacy
programs at Ft. Bragg. "To be absolutely honest, I was completely
caught off guard. We're going to look at these cases to prevent them
from happening in the future."</LD>
<LD>   Two Ft. Bragg soldiers killed their wives in murder-suicides, and
two others were charged with murdering their wives. Three of the
soldiers were from the Army's Special Operations and had just
returned from Afghanistan; the fourth was from an airborne unit and
had not been sent into action.</LD>
<TE>   Until the recent murders, base officials said no domestic abuse
deaths involving base personnel had occurred in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The string of family deaths, none of which occurred on the base,
started June 11 when Sgt. 1st Class Rigoberto Nieves fatally shot his
wife, Teresa, and himself in their Fayetteville bedroom. Nieves had
recently requested leave to resolve personal problems, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators said Jennifer Wright was strangled June
29. Her husband, Master Sgt. William Wright, reported her missing two
days later. On July 19, he led investigators to her body, buried in a
field near Fayetteville, and was charged with murder.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Wright was arrested, Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Floyd shot
his wife, Andrea, then killed himself in their Stedman home.</TE>
<TE>   The Fayetteville Observer reported that Floyd was a member of
Delta Force, the anti-terrorism unit based at Ft. Bragg.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Cedric Ramon Griffin was charged with stabbing his estranged
wife, Marilyn, at least 50 times and setting her home on fire July 9.
Griffin was in an engineering battalion.</TE>

<LD>   Susan Lemery, a married mother of three, had denied having sex

stains containing a mixture of their DNA.</LD>

<LD>A jealous Texas dentist accused of killing her orthodontist husband
by running over him several times with her Mercedes-Benz was ordered
by a judge to stay away from the woman she believed to be her
romantic rival.</LD>

<LD>   Police say Harris caught her husband, David, 44, with another
woman at a Houston area hotel Wednesday night.</LD>

husband, then circled around a parking lot and ran over him three
times. She then backed the car over him and parked it on top of him,
Magness said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Plans 'Outsider' Economic Forum</HD>
<DH>Policy: Idea is to invite business and union leaders and
workers, but not lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush will summon Cabinet members, corporate chiefs, union
officials and others to a mid-August meeting in Texas on the economy,
part of an effort to spotlight his focus on the issue during his
vacation.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual meeting, which the White House announced Friday, will
occur during what is normally a lull in government business. It will
put Bush at the center of the debate over the economy while Congress
is in recess--and set a course for his defense of his economic and
domestic policies leading up to the congressional elections in
November.</LD>
<LD>   "What the president hopes to get out of it is to be able to hear
from the American people from a variety of walks of life, from a
variety of backgrounds, whether they are union workers or whether
they are business executives," White House aide Ari Fleischer said.</LD>
<TE>   Bush also plans trips to 12 cities during his 25-day break from
the nation's capital to emphasize his message that the nation's
economy is fundamentally sound despite the recent decline of the
stock market.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will take place Aug. 13, the day before the
government's deadline for corporate chiefs to certify the accuracy of
their corporations' reports, or to revise already disclosed financial
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The White House plans to open the meeting to news coverage. Such a
public display of concern about the economy worked well for Bill
Clinton during the presidential transition after the 1992 election.
Clinton had just unseated Bush's father, in large part because of
public worries about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Before he was inaugurated, Clinton held an "economic summit" to
establish that his top priority was pulling the nation out of a
recession. It turned out, when economic figures were released later,
that an economic turnaround had already begun.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Clinton, Bush is not planning to invite members of
Congress--Republican or Democrat--to his conference. Fleischer
insisted that the meeting would be an "economic forum," not a
"summit."</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) has urged Bush
since January to hold an economic conference much like Clinton's. His
office on Friday questioned the effectiveness of Bush's gathering.</TE>
<TE>   "While I'm sure it's going to be a nice meeting, the idea was to
have a broad economic summit where we could hear from Democratic and
Republican lawmakers and economists," said Kori Bernards, a Gephardt
aide. "We need a serious summit, not a press event, if we're going to
get the nation's economic house in order."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the meeting, which he equated to round-table
discussions Bush held in Austin while he was president-elect, would
include roughly half the Cabinet, other government policymakers and a
diverse group that would include "small investors, small business
owners, industry experts, workers, business ethicists, union members,
corporate executives, economists, business students and others."</TE>
<TE>   He said they would be asked "to discuss the fundamentals in the
American economy and to talk about the president's agenda to increase
growth for the future."</TE>
<TE>   With the House starting its summer break today and the Senate
taking its recess after one more week, administration officials on
Friday tried to accentuate what they saw as several positive
developments.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market's gyrations have caused anxiety among White House
officials about voter attitudes toward Bush and the GOP, but the
downward slide of previous weeks began to slow at week's end.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Congress passed--by overwhelming margins--a corporate
reform bill that backers hope will help restore investor confidence
in the stock market. Bush may use the signing ceremony for the bill
to tout its potential effect.</TE>
<TE>   Also at week's end, Congress made progress on some of Bush's
legislative priorities, including a bill that would strengthen his
hand in reaching trade pacts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an amazing week. A lot has gotten done here in the
Congress," the president said after going to Capitol Hill for a brief
meeting with House Republicans. "I'm real proud of the members of
both parties."</TE>
<TE>   With the market's volatility, White House officials have shown
even more sensitivity than usual toward how Bush is being portrayed
by the media, particularly regarding his role in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   As the Dow Jones industrial average was soaring by nearly 500
points on Wednesday, one senior White House official began a
conversation with a reporter by asking whether Bush would get credit
for the good news to match what the aide thought was the blame
directed at the administration when the market was falling.</TE>

<HD>Firm Linked to Cheney Gets Contract for Cuba Jail Cells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A subsidiary of a company once run by Vice President Dick Cheney has
won a $9.7-million contract to build more cells for terrorist
suspects at a naval base in Cuba, the Navy announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 204 cells will expand by one-third the high-security prison at
Guantanamo Bay. The site is nearly full, with 564 suspected Al Qaeda
and Taliban prisoners captured during the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Brown &amp; Root Services, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Co., will
build the cells and is expected to finish them by the end of October.
Cheney was chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based company
from 1995 to 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Guantanamo prison--as well as the U.S. military's holding of
prisoners without charging them or giving them access to lawyers--has
drawn criticism from civil and human rights groups. The Bush
administration maintains that the Guantanamo Bay detainees are
illegal fighters and therefore are not eligible to be treated as
prisoners of war under international conventions.</TE>
<TE>   The new cells, like the others at the prison known as Camp Delta,
will be made of steel mesh and measure 6 feet, 8 inches wide by 8
feet long. Each will contain a bed, sink and toilet.</TE>

<HD>Clintons Seeking Taxpayer Money for Legal Bills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton and his wife have asked a court to have
taxpayers reimburse them for legal costs related to the Whitewater
investigation, their lawyer said late Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the former president earned $9.2 million on the lecture
circuit, and Hillary Rodham Clinton--now New York's junior
senator--received a $2.85-million advance on her memoir.</LD>
<LD>   But they still have legal bills totaling between $1.75 million and
$6.5 million, according to the financial disclosure form Hillary
Clinton was require to file as a member of the Senate. The Clintons
paid $1.3 million in legal bills last year, according to the Senate
filing.</LD>
<TE>   It is unknown how much of the outstanding bills is related to the
inquiry into the failed Arkansas land deal. The Clintons were never
charged in connection with the Whitewater investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Clinton lawyer David E. Kendall said he was
seeking reimbursement under the independent counsel statute and was
following the precedent set by former presidents Reagan and Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The law pays legal fees for the subject of an investigation if no
indictment results.</TE>
<TE>   Kendall's firm is owed $1 million to $5 million by the Clintons.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Clinton's office referred all questions to Kendall, who could
not be reached for further comment.</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Bill Hits Delay Over Abortion Detail</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP lawmakers in the House object to a deal that
Rep. Hyde reached with Democrats. Meanwhile, a trade bill is headed
for approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Antiabortion Republicans in the House early today forced what could
be a fatal delay of a bill to make it more difficult for consumers to
cancel their debts by filing for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the House moved toward passage of a bill that would
allow President Bush to negotiate new trade agreements without being
second-guessed by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The House planned to pass the compromise bankruptcy legislation
Friday night before leaving for the summer, but hit a snag after an
argument rose among Republicans over an abortion provision in the
bill.</LD>
<TE>   One of the sticking points on the legislation was a provision that
would prohibit people who attack or block access to abortion clinics
from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying court-ordered fines.</TE>
<TE>   GOP Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, one of the leading anti-abortion
Republicans in the House, had fought to curb or kill that provision,
and went along with the bankruptcy deal only after Senate Democrats
agreed to limit the measure to people who intentionally or knowingly
violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of antiabortion Republicans, led by GOP Rep. Chris
Smith of New Jersey, objected to Hyde's deal with Senate Democrats,
delaying the floor movement until September.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy and trade measures were strongly backed by
business, and their approval would have served as counterpoint to
House and Senate passage of corporate reform legislation a day
earlier. While business lobbyists were unable to head off the reform
juggernaut, which was propelled by public outrage over accounting
fraud, they demonstrated Friday that they could still flex their
muscles on other measures opposed by consumer advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush and Congress can't afford to excommunicate business," said
Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for
Politics. "Large and small businesses are critical to economic
recovery, not to mention the politicians' campaign war chests."</TE>
<TE>   House and Senate negotiators late Thursday had announced
agreements on compromise versions of the trade and bankruptcy bills;
such accords usually set the stage for quick passage of legislation.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the House, the trade bill will go to the Senate,
which could pass it as early as next week. The White House has
indicated that Bush will sign it. The trade bill would restore the
"fast-track" authority that was extended to every president from
Gerald Ford through Bill Clinton but lapsed eight years ago after the
contentious battle to approve the North American Free Trade
Agreement. It would allow the president to negotiate trade agreements
that Congress could accept or reject, but not amend.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get a free trade agreement, which is very
important for jobs and workers, very important for our farmers and
ranchers, and it's very important for our economy," Bush told
reporters after paying a visit to the Capitol to press for passage.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has said that without fast-track authority, it
cannot negotiate effectively with other countries because any deals
made could be taken apart in Congress. Bush plans to use the
authority in the new round of global trade talks launched last year
in Qatar, as well as in negotiations to create a free trade area of
the Americas that would extend NAFTA to the entire Western
Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   The measure packages fast-track authority with a significant
expansion of government benefits for workers who lose their jobs
because of trade. It would extend the length of vocational retraining
and expand it to include farmers, fishermen and workers in downstream
industries. It would provide limited tax credits to help
trade-displaced workers keep their health insurance and partial wage
insurance for older workers who take a pay cut when they go back to
work.</TE>
<TE>   The changes would nearly triple the size of the Trade Adjustment
Assistance program, increasing annual outlays from about $400 million
to more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The trade measure also would extend preferential tariff treatment
for imports from Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, whose
governments are trying to wean their economies away from cocaine
production.</TE>
<TE>   Both houses of Congress have already passed fast-track bills once,
the Senate by a 66-30 vote in May and the House by a razor-thin
215-214 in December. But it took negotiators until late Thursday to
reconcile differences between the two bills.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of fast-track "means more free trade agreements and a
more stable world economic order," Rep. Judy Biggert (R-Ill.) said
before the House took up the measure. "America wins in both
scenarios."</TE>
<TE>   But critics contend that previous trade pacts have failed to
protect the interests of U.S. workers or ensure that other countries
observe basic labor and environmental standards. Congressional
opponents want to reserve the right to participate more fully in the
process of negotiating new trade deals.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy measure would make it harder for consumers to shed
their debts, especially if they can afford partial repayment. It also
seeks to close a legal loophole that could allow executives of Enron
Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other scandal-tainted companies to declare
bankruptcy and keep their multimillion-dollar estates.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would force more people to file under Chapter 13 of the
bankruptcy code, which requires debtors to work out repayment plans
for at least some of their debts, rather than under Chapter 7, which
erases their debts entirely. The bill would establish a means test to
determine who qualifies to file under Chapter 7.</TE>
<TE>   Approval would represent a major victory for banks and credit card
companies, which contribute heavily to the campaigns of lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy cases have skyrocketed in recent years, with a record
1.5 million filings over the 12-month period ending in March 2002,
according to Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.). Studies have
indicated that tens of billions of dollars of debt is written off
every year.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE DALLES, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A wildfire burned on bluffs overlooking this Columbia River town
Friday, singeing about 6,000 acres of grass and white oak and
threatening 270 homes.</LD>
<LD>   The Sheldon Ridge fire spewed smoke over The Dalles and burned to
within a few feet of some homes perched on the hillsides, some with
dramatic views of the river and Mt. Hood.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters parked their red and yellow engines in driveways with
lights flashing and prepared to fight house to house if the fire
picked up. Gusty winds whistling through the gorge remained a key
concern.</LD>
<TE>   Anita Carothes, 38, a resident whose house was about a mile from
the fire Friday afternoon, said the blaze frightened her. The south
edge of the fire lay in clear view of her backyard. Jets of red flame
from crowning trees and bursts of gray and brown smoke rose from a
hillside.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared. I was crying," she said. "My husband assured me it
would be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Carothes walked to the edge of her lawn and watched a huge,
dual-rotor helicopter chug through swirling smoke as it dumped a
bucket of water.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. John Kitzhaber met with fire commanders and toured the fire
in a military helicopter Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very serious situation for the state in terms of
risk for property and life," Kitzhaber said of the fires.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're OK from the manpower standpoint, but our biggest
deficit now is air power," he said.</TE>
<TE>   About 125 Oregon National Guard troops were to join firefighters
at the Sheldon Ridge fire today.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheldon Ridge fire got away from four crews that had it 95%
contained Thursday morning. It grew from 150 acres to more than 5,000
acres in a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen major fires, all started by lightning, were burning across
233,000 acres in Oregon, according to the Northwest Interagency
Coordination Center. More than 10,000 firefighters battled the
blazes.</TE>

<DH>Health: Seniors advocacy group signs on to Senate proposal
that is geared to the low-income elderly.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A scaled-back proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit
gained momentum Friday, picking up support from the nation's largest
lobbying group for the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to support it," said William Novelli, executive
director and CEO of AARP. "We think this is the best we can get for
our members. It's a framework to go back and work on."</LD>
<LD>   The compromise plan would help mostly the low-income elderly or
those who have already spent a significant amount on medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate health
committee, conceded that the measure is gathering steam even though a
group of senators continues to try to develop a more comprehensive
plan that would provide coverage for all senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those that believe we need a down payment of some form
or shape even if it has to be a catastrophic proposal," Kennedy said.
"Certainly, I think at this point, the majority of Democratic members
feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine), who is working on a more
expansive plan, said lawmakers were giving in too soon. "There's no
reason to go with a lesser plan. It's a cop-out." She added that she
believes a more comprehensive plan still is "doable."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy predicted that the scaled-back plan would get bipartisan
support. Final details were being worked out by Sens. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.).</TE>
<TE>   "This new bipartisan plan will help all seniors buy prescription
drugs, but it will give the greatest help to the most vulnerable
older Americans, those with lower incomes and with the most serious
health problems," Graham said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good, focused plan that all of us should be able to
support," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise is a retreat from Democrats' longtime push for a
comprehensive benefit that covers all senior citizens. But it also
omits Republicans' push to have a plan that relies on private
insurers. The compromise calls for a benefit administered through
Medicare, according to one Senate Democratic aide, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would cost an estimated $400 billion over 10 years
and would cover about half of the 40 million senior citizens on
Medicare, Kennedy said. That's substantially smaller than the
$594-billion plan Democrats unsuccessfully brought to the House floor
this week. That plan, as well as a $370-billion proposal offered by a
coalition of Republicans, a Democrat and the Senate's lone
independent, failed to get the 60 votes necessary to pass.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Republican lawmakers offered a $160-billion plan that
also was targeted to the poorest seniors and those with high drug
costs, but that plan also failed.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise proposal is substantially different from that
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level
(about $18,000 annually for a family of two) would get full coverage
with nominal co-payments, according to Senate Democratic aides. All
other seniors would receive government help of 5% of the cost of each
prescription drug, although aides said additional discounts could be
provided through group purchasing power.</TE>
<TE>   More government help would kick in once a senior citizen reached
$4,000 in drug costs. At that point, there would be a $10 co-payment
on each prescription drug and the government would pick up the
remaining costs.</TE>
<TE>   All but low-income beneficiaries would pay a $25 annual enrollment
fee, but there would be no monthly premiums or deductibles.</TE>
<TE>   The Medicare proposal would be offered as an amendment to a bill
that eases access to generic drugs and is being used for an overall
debate on prescription drugs.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Child Services Worker Found Passed Out With Infant in
Car</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Florida child welfare worker was arrested Friday after police found
her passed out drunk in a car with a foster child in the back seat,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables said they found the car
stopped in the middle of a road with the engine running, the driver
asleep and a crying 7-month-old girl strapped into a safety seat in
the back. There was a half-empty bottle of rum in the car, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   The officers said they broke into the car, smelled alcohol, awoke
the driver and tried to give her a sobriety test. "The defendant was
unable to stand by herself," the officers wrote in their arrest
report. The baby was unharmed and was turned over to state protective
custody, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Driver Miria Pronga, 56, was jailed on charges of child neglect
and drunken driving with a passenger under age 18. Pronga was a
caseworker for the state Department of Children &amp; Families and had
picked up the baby from her foster parents for a visit with her
biological parents, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency released a statement saying it fired Pronga after
learning of her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Department of Children &amp; Families was already under fire
over the disappearance of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson. It took 15 months
for state officials to realize she was missing.</TE>

<HD>Bomber Kaczynski Is Again Published</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The last time Theodore J. Kaczynski had a lengthy article published,
his 35,000-word manifesto led his brother to identify him as the
Unabomber, the man who had killed three people and injured 23 during
a 17-year mail-bomb spree that authorities had not yet been able to
solve.</LD>
<LD>   Seven years later, locked behind the walls of a federal maximum
security prison in Colorado, Kaczynski has apparently managed to get
his controversial views in print again.</LD>
<LD>   In an article published this spring by Green Anarchy, a radical
environmental newsletter, Kaczynski calls on revolutionaries to
"eliminate the entire techno-industrial system" by "hitting where it
hurts" and disparages the activities of most radicals as "pointless."</LD>
<TE>   The essay, which repeats Kaczynski's contention that modern
society must be destroyed, has disturbed Unabomber survivors as well
as prison officials, who are investigating whether the article
violates rules that prohibit prisoners from publishing under their
own names. Even the newsletter's editors objected to some of
Kaczynski's views.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised that he's able to write these things," said Charles
Epstein, a California physician and researcher who lost fingers from
one hand when he opened a mail bomb sent by Kaczynski in 1993. "To
the extent that his message potentially influences malleable people,
it's a concern."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still reviewing the case, but they said they
believe the essay is authentic.</TE>
<TE>   One of the newsletter's editors, John Zerzan of Eugene, Ore., said
he corresponds regularly with Kaczynski and received the essay from
him.</TE>

<LD>A FedEx Boeing 727 cargo jet crashed and burned short of the runway
Friday at the Tallahassee airport, but the three-member crew escaped
serious injury.</LD>
<LD>   The plane was carrying the paperwork of several candidates who
were rushing to meet a noon filing deadline to run for office in
Florida. After the crash, Gov. Jeb Bush signed an executive order
setting a new deadline of 5 p.m. today for those candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The three-engine jet went down half a mile short of the runway
before daybreak, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The three
crew members were listed in fair condition at a hospital.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The National
Transportation Safety Board and a FedEx team were investigating.</TE>

<HD>Dow Seeks to Ban Its Own Weedkiller</HD>
<DH>EPA: Agency is asked to pull clopyralid--toxic to some
garden plants--for homeowners' use, although lawn care firms still
would have access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing a wide-scale ban in California, the maker of a highly potent
weedkiller asked the federal government Friday to ban the use of its
own product by homeowners across the country.</LD>
<LD>   The action by Dow Chemical subsidiary Dow AgroSciences would
remove lawn care products containing the weedkiller clopyralid from
the shelves of hardware stores and garden centers nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The request, made to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
would not prevent professional lawn care companies, or even local
gardeners, from applying the chemical to residential lawns, nor would
it keep it off the grass at cemeteries, schools, parks and other
public spaces.</LD>
<TE>   Dow spokesman Garry Hamlin said the company decided to request the
residential restrictions after discussions with the EPA about
problems with clopyralid residues on grass left for pickup by
curbside collection programs. This grass then was turned into garden
compost at municipal recycling centers. Finished compost made from
grass treated with clopyralid has proved toxic to some common garden
plants.</TE>
<TE>   Dow AgroSciences Vice President Erin Miller described the move as
"a prudent step" while scientists studied the decomposition of the
chemical in compost.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors of a California Assembly bill calling for tighter
restrictions dismissed Dow's move as window dressing.</TE>
<TE>   "Dow is trying to put itself in the role of a responsible
citizen," said Stephen Grealy, recycling program supervisor for San
Diego. "But in effect what they are trying to do is undercut
legislation that would go a lot further to cure the problem. Half of
the lawn in California is commercial lawn, and that's where most of
it is used. Dow is only removing it for sale for treatment of
residential lawn."</TE>
<TE>   The chemical, which was approved by the EPA in 1987, is sold in
all 50 states under as many as 37 brand names, such as Confront,
Stinger and Lontrel. It is a favorite of lawn care companies because
it kills dandelions, thistles and English daisies but spares grass. A
little bit also goes a long way: One application lasts a year, where
rival products may have to be applied two or three times a year.</TE>
<TE>   However, by 1999, clopyralid's persistence had been identified as
a problem by Dow and university researchers. Unlike other garden
chemicals, it did not break down when cut grass was sent for
recycling into compost. Soil scientists from Washington State
University traced deaths of "non-target" but sensitive plants--such
as tomatoes and petunias in nurseries and community gardens--to
compost made from grass clippings from treated lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Further cases of contamination were subsequently recorded in New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Zealand and Canada. In Pennsylvania,
the clopyralid residues were so potent that compost made from leaves
that had fallen on treated lawns was contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   In California, which only licensed the chemical in 1997, grass
recycling facilities in San Diego and Los Angeles recorded the first
positive tests for clopyralid last year. By February of this year,
the California compost industry estimated that as many as two-thirds
of the state's facilities had some sort of contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal compost sold in Los Angeles and San Diego comes with
warnings that it may kill common garden vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   The pervasiveness of positive tests prompted the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation to issue an emergency ban in
February. This seems to have worked, according to recycling
supervisors in San Diego and Los Angeles. After a series of positive
tests at two Los Angeles facilities earlier this year, "everything
has been coming up clean, clean, clean," said Stephen Fortune, the
principal sanitary engineer at the Bureau of Sanitation.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego now is getting clean tests, and elsewhere in the state,
in hard-hit counties such as Sonoma, green-waste recyclers report
that clopyralid contamination levels are falling steadily.</TE>
<TE>   However, the recycling community--a mix of local governments and
private contractors--also has turned to lawmakers. Last spring, it
lobbied for an Assembly bill banning almost all turf use of the
chemical. The measure has been approved by the Assembly, and its
sponsors expect the state Senate to follow suit this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Washington state, where the chemical has been most
heavily used, state and city officials said almost all of the compost
tested is positive, and readings are routinely five to 10 times
higher than in California. The worry is that clopyralid contamination
will end the market for municipal compost and bring down entire
green-waste recycling programs developed in the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Spokane Regional Solid Waste System said Monday that it plans
to close its 72-acre Colbert compost facility because of clopyralid
contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The facility that once composted 40,000 tons of yard waste a year
has been unable to take in this season's clippings because of a
backlog of unusable compost tainted by the chemical. The authority
plans to buy out the contract of the operator of the Colbert facility
for $950,000 and close the site, in spite of millions of dollars
invested in it. "We don't wish to be owning the land or be in this
business anymore," said Damon Taam, system contract manager for
Spokane Regional Solid Waste System.</TE>
<TE>   The authority also is considering suing Dow.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an option that we're exploring," Taam said. "We've
obviously had a significant amount of damage here."</TE>

<HD>Second Rescue Shaft Dug in Effort to Reach Miners</HD>
<DH>Cave-in: Crews lost half a day after a drill broke. It's
unknown if any of the nine men still are alive. Last sounds of life
were heard Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN and DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SOMERSET, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Losing 18 precious hours because of a broken drill, rescuers began
burrowing a second escape shaft Friday in their dogged attempt to
free nine miners hemmed in for nearly two days deep in a
water-saturated coal mine.</LD>
<LD>   By day's end, both mechanical borers were digging toward the
miners, cut off 240 feet below the surface of the Quecreek Mine. The
first rig, repaired with a 1,500-pound metal bit flown in by
helicopter, was still more than 100 feet from the trapped men in late
evening. The second rig, operating all day but making halting
progress through bedrock, was about 200 feet away.</LD>
<LD>   "It's gone painfully slow," a frustrated Pennsylvania Gov. Mark
Schweiker said. "Now we're picking up the pace. We've got two rescue
shafts underway."</LD>
<TE>   Rescuers did not know if any of the men still were alive. The only
evidence of life below has come from the succession of nine taps on a
metal pipe--miners' code signaling the presence of survivors--last
heard Thursday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, there was only silence underground.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disheartening when you lose communication," said Dave
Lauriski, head of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, one
of several federal agencies involved in the rescue effort.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets of rain slanted down much of the day as worried public
officials, engineers, mining company workers and volunteers massed
around drenched crews straining to master their balky machines and
make up for lost time. At a nearby fire station, relatives of the
trapped men gathered to wait and pray, joined by concerned neighbors,
some of whom had lost loved ones in similar disasters.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody can survive, I would place my bet they'll make it
out," said Mike Maurer, 44, whose brother-in-law is trapped miner
Robert Pugh, 50. Maurer and other local miners identified eight of
the trapped men as Pugh, John Unger, Randall Fogle, Thomas Foy,
Blaine Mayhew, Ron Heilman, John Philipe and Mark Poperneck.</TE>
<TE>   Even with both drills churning, Schweiker said just before dusk
that rescuers would not close in on the trapped crew for at least six
hours. Other officials said they were uncertain when the drills would
be able to pierce the dense layers of limestone, shale, sandstone and
finally, coal pillars. "Bottom line, it's going to take long,"
Schweiker conceded.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers sought to protect the trapped miners from potentially
fatal hypothermia or decompression.</TE>
<TE>   Six powerful blowers pumped air heated to 190 degrees down through
holes punched into the earth to keep the men warm, while the Navy
trucked in nine portable hyperbaric chambers to protect them from the
"bends," a lethal sickness they could contract from high underground
water levels.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Capt. Henry Schwartz, a specialist in underwater medicine,
said that air pressure building inside the 4-foot-high coal seam
could rise to rates similar to those experienced by divers 40 feet
underwater. Lethal bubbles could develop in the miners' blood during
their ascent to ground level, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they have concluded that the 4-foot-high chamber
where the miners were trapped was waterlogged but probably contained
enough air to keep them alive. Their helmet lantern batteries likely
were spent, said Joseph A. Sbaffoni, chief of the state's Bureau of
Deep Mine Safety, leaving them in darkness inside the coal-lined
crawlspace.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Darrigo, 72, a veteran of western Pennsylvania mines, said the
trapped men would be "in total darkness down there now. That's the
hardest part. But if they're in a dry area, if they've found an air
bubble, they could get out."</TE>
<TE>   A large air bubble could protect the trapped men from
body-chilling hypothermia, particularly if the temperature inside the
seam was raised by drafts of hot air pumped from above, said Raja
Ramani, professor of mining engineering at Penn State University.</TE>
<TE>   "The concern is that the coal seam is only 52 inches high and
these miners may not have adequate head room," Ramani said. "But as
long as there is breathable atmosphere, hypothermia and other
problems should not be serious if they can be reached in a reasonable
amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   For much of the day, optimism was about the only thing keeping
rescuers going. On the verdant hill where the drilling rigs rumbled,
an army of volunteers had little else to do except rehearse its role
in the planned rescue and pray that the chance would come.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sitting here, watching and hoping and praying," said
Terry Smith, 45, a firefighter assigned to a rescue detail if the
miners are found alive. "That's all we've got left: hoping and
praying."</TE>
<TE>   Smith had a personal stake in his duty. A coal miner for 27 years
who quit because of an injury a few years ago, Smith knows seven of
the trapped men. Two of them, Unger, 52, and Pugh, are his close
friends.</TE>
<TE>   As he trudged toward the Sipesville Volunteer Fire Department
headquarters, where the miners' families kept a vigil, Smith said
that when he crawled down deep into the coal caverns, he constantly
feared being trapped.</TE>
<TE>   "But I loved doing it," he added. "I'd say they loved it too."</TE>
<TE>   Leaving a church vigil Friday night in the neighboring town of
Acosta, Maurer said he understands why Pugh, known to his friends as
"Boogie," kept going down below.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd never quit," Maurer said after praying for Pugh's safe
return. "If he comes out, he'd be back at work on Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Among those gathered at the drilling site were Louise Wolk, 54, a
day-care administrator whose husband, Tim Shaffer, died in a cave-in
at the nearby Ralphton No. 5 mine in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Wolk still clenches at the memory of the co-workers who drove up
to her house that day and told her there had been an accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a goner," she remembered one of the men telling her.</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting word of the nine miners, Wolk had stayed up all night,
waiting until 6:30 a.m. Friday, when the drilling stoppage made it
painfully clear that a rescue was still many long hours away. Haggard
from lack of sleep, she went with her daughter, Diane Henry, to the
firehouse to support the families who now feared what she had endured
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I can do for those families is go to the hall and
pray," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the weather-beaten clapboard firehouse, preachers came and
went, huddling with agonized relatives and counseling their children.
The families mingled, talking about their missing husbands and
fathers and sons.</TE>
<TE>   One local minister led a row of relatives out from the firehouse
into the backyard. There, under gray clouds, they prayed, silently
and aloud, clutching each other's hands and borrowed Bibles.</TE>

<HD>St. Louis Area Girl Found Dead After Disappearing From Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The body of a 6-year-old girl was found Friday afternoon, several
hours after she vanished from her father's home in a St. Louis
suburb, police said. A transient who had spent Thursday night on the
father's sofa was arrested in connection with what appeared to be the
murder of Cassandra Williamson.</LD>
<LD>   The first-grader, who went by the nickname Casey, disappeared from
the kitchen of the home in Valley Park shortly after 7:30 a.m.,
police said. Her father, Ernie Williamson, said he was just about to
pour his daughter a bowl of cereal when he left the kitchen to go to
the bathroom.</LD>
<LD>   When he returned, the girl was gone, he told police.</LD>
<TE>   Casey's disappearance drew national attention Friday because of
several recent child abductions. Missouri authorities immediately
took the case seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Before noon, local police, St. Louis County deputy sheriffs, FBI
agents as well as residents of the town of 6,500 were combing parks
and waterways and knocking on doors in the town. Helicopters and
bloodhounds were also used in the search.</TE>
<TE>   In the early afternoon, police discovered Casey's tiny white
nightgown with red flowers. A short time later, police found an
unclothed body believed to be Casey's in an abandoned glass factory a
few blocks from the home after they were directed there by the
transient.</TE>
<TE>   And Friday night, Casey's parents identified the girl's body. The
parents, hugging and crying, were driven away behind the coroner's
van carrying the body.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis County Police Chief Ron Battelle did not describe the
condition of the body but said an autopsy was planned to determine
the cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested Johnny Johnson, 24; no charges have been
filed.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Williamson and Casey's mother, Angela Williamson, had
separated, according to police, with the mother taking up residence
at a home nearby, along with the couple's four children, as she and
her husband tried to reconcile. However, the entire family
occasionally spent the night at the father's house. That, police say,
is what happened Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Williamson spent the night in the same room as her father,
police said. Johnson slept on a couch in the living room. It is
unclear how the red-haired, boyish-looking Johnson knew Ernie
Williamson or his roommate.</TE>
<TE>   "She never walks off without telling me she's going somewhere,"
Angela Williamson said before the body was found. "She doesn't even
go to her friend's house without telling me she was going. I just
want my baby."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the day, police began questioning Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   When Ernie Williamson returned from the bathroom to find his
daughter missing, police say, he also noticed that Johnson was gone.
Half an hour later, Johnson returned to the home, wet and muddy. He
had been swimming in the nearby Meramec River, he allegedly said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, police say, has been cooperating in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's was the latest in a series of high-profile kidnappings of
young girls from their homes in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, 50-year-old David Westerfield is on trial, accused
of kidnapping 7-year-old Danielle van Dam from her bed on Feb. 2. The
girl's decomposed body was found three weeks later near the side of a
road.</TE>
<TE>   On June 5, Elizabeth Ann Smart, 14, was taken from her bedroom in
her family's Salt Lake City home. Elizabeth is still missing and no
one has been arrested in connection with her disappearance. Richard
Ricci, 48, a handyman who once worked for the Smart family and who
was charged with stealing jewelry and a perfume bottle from the home,
is among several people police say they are looking at, but he has
not been named a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Five weeks later, on July 15, 5-year-old Samantha Runnion was
snatched near her home in Orange County by a man who said he was
searching for a lost puppy. A person using a hang glider found her
body the next day in the Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   It had been placed in the open and positioned, police say, as if
to taunt officials.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Avila, 27, of Lake Elsinore, was arrested a week later
and charged with sexually assaulting and killing Runnion.</TE>
<TE>   And on Tuesday, 7-year-old Erica Pratt was abducted from the yard
of her grandmother's South Philadelphia home by two men who later
demanded a $150,000 ransom. Pratt's is the only case thus far to have
ended well, when she escaped from the North Philadelphia house where
she was being held.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security Bill Clears House</HD>
<DH>Cabinet: The most sweeping government reorganization in
decades passes on a 295-132 vote. Bush strongly backs measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House approved legislation Friday to create a Department of
Homeland Security, with nearly all Republicans and many Democrats
embracing the most significant government reorganization in more than
50 years.</LD>
<LD>   House passage of the homeland security bill, on a 295-132 vote,
came less than two months after President Bush proposed the overhaul
in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would create the third-largest Cabinet department, after
Defense and Veterans Affairs, consolidating 22 disparate federal
agencies into one focused on defending the nation against terrorism
and other domestic threats.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration issued a statement strongly supporting the
House's bill, even though it would split the Immigration and
Naturalization Service between the proposed security department and
the Justice Department. The president prefers to move the entire
agency into the new department.</TE>
<TE>   In a position paper, the administration said the House bill
"reflects the president's proposal" and "establishes a strong
framework" to focus the government on domestic security.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has threatened to veto the Senate version, which
limits the administration's ability to hire and fire personnel in the
department. It could come to a vote next week.</TE>
<TE>   The House action capped a remarkable week in which Congress also
approved landmark corporate reform legislation and an anti-terrorism
spending bill and prepared to clear major trade-promotion and
bankruptcy reform bills. Bush came to the Capitol on Friday afternoon
to rally Republicans behind his legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   House members begin a one-month recess today. The Senate will
remain in session for another week.</TE>
<TE>   However, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chief sponsor of the
Senate bill, said Friday that efforts to pass the homeland security
bill before the Senate breaks for the summer could be "in jeopardy."
The bill's critics may delay action through parliamentary maneuvers,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In two days of debate on the House floor, the Republican-drafted
bill survived most Democratic efforts to alter it.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, lawmakers voted nearly along party lines to affirm the
president's power, on national security grounds, to deny collective
bargaining rights to federal employees who would be moved to the new
department. Currently, more than 25% of the affected employees are
represented by unions.</TE>
<TE>   That issue and others connected to proposed executive powers have
become ideological flashpoints in a debate where most lawmakers agree
on the need for a new agency.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in a blunt White House speech Friday, warned lawmakers he is
"not going to accept" a bill that allows Congress to "micromanage"
his administration's efforts to bolster domestic security. Yet the
president said he wanted to work with such Democrats as Lieberman and
Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher of Alamo, two sponsors of homeland security
legislation who were in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on the cusp of doing something right for America," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   House Democratic leaders complained that Republicans had rebuffed
their attempts to fashion a bipartisan bill. Several opposed it, but
reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   "I have some concerns about the bill," said House Minority Whip
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, who voted against it. "[That] doesn't
mean I have concerns about the idea. We all know we want a Department
of Homeland Security."</TE>
<TE>   But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said Congress needs to
"move forward to provide the president with the tools he needs to
defend the homeland." The new department, he said, would be "a
comprehensive agency that's engineered to combat the dangers that are
unique to our time."</TE>
<TE>   In the final vote, 88 Democrats joined 207 Republicans for the
bill. Opposed were 120 Democrats, 10 Republicans and two
independents.</TE>
<TE>   Among California's 52 House members, eight Democrats joined 19
Republicans in voting to create the department. The remaining 24
Democratic members of the state delegation, who voted against the
bill, were joined inadvertently by Rep. William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield). Thomas, a strong supporter of the president's
proposal, sheepishly explained on the House floor that he had
accidentally cast a no vote. But the wide margin for passage belied
several close fights on amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the sharpest exchange came over airport security. The GOP
bill would extend by one year the Dec. 31 deadline--set by Congress
last year--for airports to install bomb-detection equipment to be
used on all checked bags. Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) proposed
to keep the current deadline. He called his amendment a
"life-or-death vote" and warned that lawmakers could be inviting
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) faced jeers and shouts for opposing
Oberstar. But Portman replied: "A lot of raising voices and yelling
isn't going to get the job done." Republicans, arguing that many
airports need more time, defeated Oberstar, 217 to 211.</TE>
<TE>   By a 215-214 vote, Republicans defeated a Democratic effort to
remove a provision in the bill that would limit liability for
businesses that supply homeland security products. On top of that,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), chief sponsor of the
bill, won approval for an amendment that expands the bill's liability
protections to airport security companies. It drew bitter Democratic
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) called the Armey amendment
"the most irresponsible position I can imagine.... There must be a
payoff." Armey angrily dismissed what he called a "sophomorish
allegation."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats complained that Republicans were catering to corporate
interests; Republicans shot back that their foes were beholden to
trial lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   By a 222-208 vote, Republicans killed an amendment to ensure
collective bargaining rights for the roughly 50,000 employees
represented by labor unions who would move to the new department.
Instead, the House passed, 229 to 201, an amendment that would allow
the president to waive those rights in cases in which he justifies,
in writing, on the grounds of national security concerns.
Republicans, echoing Bush, said that every president since Jimmy
Carter has been able to exercise a national security waiver of
federal labor relations law.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the partisan acrimony, Republicans drew large blocs of
Democrats to defend the core of the Bush plan, indicating that many
turf battles over the reorganization have subsided.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, lawmakers easily defeated amendments to keep the
Federal Emergency Management Agency out of the new department and to
make the White House anti-terrorism advisor subject to Senate
confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Both proposals could have drawn a Bush veto.</TE>
<TE>   The votes in favor of the scope of the reorganization gave strong
momentum to the plan Bush unveiled on June 6 to move about 169,000
federal employees into a department with an annual budget of $37
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Few now doubt that the new department will include such agencies
as the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, FEMA or the Customs
Service--all of which have strong allies on Capitol Hill that
initially protested the transfer. That development increases the
likelihood that Bush will be able to sign a bill later this year
comparable to the one that helped create the modern Pentagon and
intelligence agencies in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a new department would improve domestic security is a
question critics will continue to ask. Some lawmakers noted during
this week's debate that the creation of the departments of Energy in
1977 and Education in 1979 did not solve the nation's energy problems
or eliminate public school troubles.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates claimed the new department would help mobilize a
post-Sept. 11 America to prevent terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Comparing Security Plans</TE>
<TE>   Here are highlights of a House-passed bill to create a Department
of Homeland Security, compared with the White House proposal and a
Democratic version approved this week by a Senate committee.</TE>
<TE>   Size: President Bush proposed the creation of a department with
about 169,000 employees from 22 agencies, including the Customs
Service, the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Congress largely agrees with that structure. But the House
bill, like the Senate draft, would trim more than 5,000 Agriculture
Department employees from the Bush plan. The House also would keep
several thousand Immigration and Naturalization Service employees in
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration: Bush would move the INS into a border and
transportation security unit within the new department. The Senate
bill would move the INS into the department but make it a separate
division. The House bill would split the INS, moving border and
immigration enforcement functions (the bulk of the service) into
homeland security but leaving immigration services in the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Employee rights: Bush proposed giving the department authority to
craft a "flexible, contemporary" alternative to the existing civil
service system. The House bill would preserve some flexibility for
the president but enumerate a range of worker rights, including
whistle-blower protections. The Senate bill would go further,
guaranteeing collective bargaining rights.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation security: The House bill would extend for one year the
Dec. 31 federal deadline for installing bomb-detection equipment in
airports to screen baggage. Neither Bush nor the Senate Democrats
have proposed such an extension.</TE>
<TE>   Privacy: The House bill, unlike Bush's proposal, would add an
officer to the department to guard privacy rights, ban a national ID
card and kill a federal initiative to encourage anti-terrorist
tipsters. The Senate version includes a privacy officer.</TE>

<DH>When attorney Lynne Stewart was charged with aiding
terrorists, New York lawyers of all stripes came to her aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When FBI agents swarmed onto Lynne F. Stewart's front stoop in
Brooklyn on April 9 with an arrest warrant, she thought they'd come
for her partner of 34 years, Ralph Poynter, a longtime political
activist. An agent informed her otherwise: "We're not here for him,
we're here for you."</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, a 62-year-old lawyer, was handcuffed in front of her
neighbors and charged with helping one of her jailed clients--a blind
Egyptian cleric convicted of plotting to blow up Manhattan
landmarks--pass messages to his militant followers.</LD>
<LD>   As agents took the plump, grandmotherly Stewart away, she shouted
to Poynter: "Whatever this is, call the media."</LD>
<TE>   The arrest put Stewart at the center of a controversy that has
jeopardized her career but also brought her to the attention of the
tight-knit defense bar. Despite annoyance with her anachronistic
lefty ways, many of these lawyers are rallying around her on
principle.</TE>
<TE>   They are horrified that this lawyer, any lawyer, is being lumped
in a conspiracy with the likes of militant Muslims who live to kill
Jews and take down governments; they are convinced that the
government is growing increasingly hostile toward them and the people
they represent.</TE>
<TE>   And little-known attorney Stewart, a former librarian who wears
billowy tent dresses and unstyled gray hair, has come to personify
all these concerns and more. She has the nation's top prosecutor to
thank for her newfound fame.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing her indictment, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the
three-year investigation that led to Stewart's arrest inspired the
Justice Department to assert new powers to monitor lawyers and their
clients when the attorney general suspects doing so could deter
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply aren't going to allow people who are convicted of
terrorism to continue ... directing the activity from their prison,"
Ashcroft said later that day during an appearance on CBS-TV's "Late
Show With David Letterman," before he performed "Can't Buy Me Love"
on the piano for Letterman's cheering audience.</TE>
<TE>   In charging Stewart with conspiring to aid terrorists, lying and
breaking an agreement with the Bureau of Prisons, the government says
she crossed the line from criminal advocate to criminal.</TE>
<TE>   From a dingy office with a broken toilet, Stewart has spent 27
years representing small-time crooks and leftist radicals in the
tradition of such legal bomb-throwers as the late William Kunstler,
with whom she tried five cases.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is reveling in being pitted against the conservative
attorney general, and says this case is the culmination of her life's
work.</TE>
<TE>   "I just never thought I'd be the one who could pull blacks,
Chinese, environmentalists, American Indians, Arabs ... all these
groups together in one case," she said during an interview in her
Lower Manhattan office, referring to her natural allies over the
years. "I thought I'd be the lawyer, not the defendant."</TE>
<TE>   As she was released on $500,000 bail after a few hours, FBI agents
searched her office, seizing files, computer disks--even her Rolodex.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, Stewart's friends--$50-an-hour lawyers with clients
accused of 60 rapes or worse--held a fund-raiser over a deli near her
office. The mostly young lawyers drank wine from plastic cups, griped
about the heat and slipped checks for her defense fund into a
cardboard box.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, a local law school drew a tonier crowd for a
round-table discussion titled "The Attorney-Client Privilege at the
Crossroads: The Indictment of Lynne Stewart." Panelist Michael Tigar,
a nationally acclaimed defense lawyer, announced to great applause
that he would take on her case.</TE>
<TE>   These lawyers said they suspect Ashcroft of going after Stewart to
intimidate them, and that she was picked precisely because she is not
the most popular lawyer in town. Many see her as a throwback to 1960s
rebelliousness and do not appreciate her habit of embracing her
clients' causes.</TE>
<TE>   "What I am doing here," said one of her frustrated but loyal
backers, "is defending the right of a lawyer to represent a
fascist--stupidly."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart brushes aside criticisms of her and her unpopular client,
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, preferring to focus on her nemesis,
Ashcroft, whose picture hangs above that broken toilet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a Midwestern Christian fundamentalist and I really think
they view liberal Easterners as having horns and pointed tails and
not being folks like he is," she said. "But he has grossly
underestimated me. I'm not some lesbian lefty."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, a 24-page indictment put together by the New York U.S.
Attorney's office marks her as the U.S. justice system's worst
nightmare: A lawyer who exploits her protected role to commit a crime
against the country.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart and three others are accused of conspiring to keep Abdel
Rahman at the helm of his terrorist organization, even though he is
serving 65 years behind bars. The indictment said Stewart discussed
inconsequential matters using English legalese to distract guards,
while Rahman talked about Islamic revolution in Arabic to translator
Mohammed Yousry, who also was indicted.</TE>
<TE>   The government began monitoring the conversations early in the
sheik's prison stay after he publicly called on his followers to
"avenge" him. (And they did--killing 58 tourists in Egypt in 1997 and
stuffing leaflets demanding his release into their torsos.) The
Bureau of Prisons placed the sheik in solitary confinement and made
Stewart agree not to convey his views to the media.</TE>
<TE>   She admits she violated that pact in May 2000 by telling Reuters
the sheik believed his organization should no longer observe a
cease-fire on terrorism. She lost visiting privileges briefly, but
then signed a new agreement. Prosecutors allege she violated that one
too, by acting as a link between the sheik and the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Branded a Traitor</TE>
<TE>   "They claim she went too far, but the government went even
farther," said Ellen Yaroshefksy, a law professor who moderated the
round-table. "Instead of charging her with violating prison
regulations, she was branded a traitor."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors won't discuss the indictment, but after the
round-table, where Stewart was cheered pep-rally style by about 300
lawyers, U.S. Atty. James Comey issued a terse statement: "With a
trial pending and few facts disclosed so far, it is grossly premature
for anyone to draw conclusions.... The government will present its
evidence ... at trial. After that, analysis and round-table
discussions will be fully formed." The trial is due to begin late
next year.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last spring at her office suite, Stewart sounds
like the last campus radical. She is surrounded by tattered
furniture; newsletters about an upcoming union meeting are in the
reception area; four large courtroom drawings of her and Abdel Rahman
adorn the walls. A photograph of a clench-fisted revolutionary looms
above it all.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheik is a star," she said, "one of those people you meet in
this world journey and you know immediately you are in the presence
of someone worldly."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which
killed almost 3,000 people just blocks from her office, do not seem
to have shaken her views. In America, she said, these men may be
called terrorists, but to their people "they are freedom fighters"
whose enemies are oppressive Arab regimes and the U.S. for supporting
them.</TE>
<TE>   "America likes to say, 'Do it our way,' but people have to do it
their way," she said. "We are a country founded in violence and so it
is used by others to determine their own future."</TE>
<TE>   But what if that violence touched her, if her grandchildren had
been in the twin towers?</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had to answer questions like that," she said, noting
that she had represented Black Panthers and members of the Weather
Underground. "Those people were not about going quietly into that
good night and [singing] 'We Shall Overcome' and getting their heads
beaten in. They were about fighting back."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is hardly just an affable grandmother in sensible shoes,
as she often portrays herself during jury summations.</TE>
<TE>   Raised on Long Island by two Republican schoolteachers, she became
a teacher herself after college, and later a librarian in Harlem
schools in the 1960s. There, she met Poynter, a black teacher
fighting for community control of the schools. In her 20s, Stewart
joined his cause and grew increasingly enraged by all the poor
children who could not read and who had no hope.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few years, they had left their spouses and were together.
Now an investigator for Stewart's law practice, Poynter, 68,
explained: "When you're politically together, the rest is
inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Together they have fought capitalism, protested at rallies and
raised children--one of theirs, three of his and two of hers--in an
East Village apartment with an enviable view of the New York skyline.
(They now have seven grandchildren and live in Brooklyn.)</TE>
<TE>   Stewart pursued law when she became fed up with the school system.
At age 32, she entered Rutgers Law School in New Jersey and joined
anti-war protests. Later she took up criminal defense work because it
fit with her politics. She would represent anyone except child
abusers and pedophiles.</TE>
<TE>   She teamed with Kunstler to get drug dealer Larry Davis acquitted
of trying to kill nine police officers in a 1986 shootout. She
defended David Gilbert, a Weather Underground member, and Richard
Williams, who was convicted of setting off bombs at military sites
and corporate offices in the early 1980s. And she was assigned by
judges to defend mobsters, including Sammy "The Bull" Gravano.
Although she was never the marquee radical lawyer in New York, she
built an impressive list of despised clients over the years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Grandmother's Style</TE>
<TE>   John Gallagher, a former prosecutor who opposed Stewart in the
Williams case, said her style is to convince juries "in a
grandmotherly way that she is a nice person representing people who
are victims of government overzealousness."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Kunstler, the czar of courtroom theatrics, Stewart does not
try to distract "a jury from the facts by clashing with judges and
prosecutors," Gallagher added.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Stewart distanced herself from Kunstler, telling The
Times in a 1994 interview: "He's a mirror of the times because the
'60s was an era of hope and change. When that disappears you get
involved with things that aren't as pure. You make excuses and see
political righteousness in cases where it's not quite so."</TE>
<TE>   Yet that's how some lawyers viewed her during the sheik's case in
1995, when he and nine others were tried for engaging in a "war of
urban terrorism." In interviews, Stewart seemed to champion the
sheik's cause as much as represent him.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Lefcourt, another well-known defender of radicals, said
that in the 1960s lawyers often said "all kinds of things in public."</TE>
<TE>   But "things get really dangerous when the government starts
interpreting a lawyer's words to his client in private," he added.
"In this case the government decided Lynne stepped over a line. She's
just too smart for that."</TE>
<TE>   At worst, her defenders argue, Stewart might have been "sloppy"
during visits and weekly phone meetings with the sheik, or that her
anti-government attitude might have colored her professionalism when
talking to the sheik's collaborators. Some suspect she was duped, but
she's not going for that:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not prepared at this point to say ... things were going on
behind my back."</TE>
<TE>   She is sticking with her co-defendants, speaking of the rights of
oppressed Muslims, managing her own public relations and vowing to
fight the good fight. And, yes, enjoying every minute of it.</TE>
<TE>   When she left her office at dusk for a retirement party for a
local judge, Stewart said that, unlike a lot of New Yorkers, she
never worries about another terrorist strike here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more worried about some fat white racist cop from Scarsdale
stopping my Ralph at a red light and him saying something and the cop
shooting him in the head," she said. "Now that's what I worry about."</TE>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For Renny Rogers, it was strange enough that military jets were
flying low over his home in Waldorf, Md., in the middle of the night.
It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early
Friday that floored him.</LD>
<LD>   "It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a
phenomenal rate of speed," Rogers said. "This Air Force jet was right
behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the
dust. I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.' "</LD>
<LD>   Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air
Force Base were scrambled early Friday after radar detected an
unknown aircraft in Washington airspace. But they scoff at the idea
that the jets were chasing a speedy unidentified flying object.</LD>
<TE>   "We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft," said
Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace
Defense Command in Colorado. "Everything was fine in the sky, so they
returned home."</TE>
<TE>   Military officials say they do not know just what the jets were
chasing, because whatever it was disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers says what he saw was not routine. "It looked like a
shooting star with no trailing mist."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A white-supremacist couple were found guilty Friday of plotting to
blow up Jewish and black landmarks around Boston.</LD>
<LD>   A federal jury deliberated over two days before convicting Leo
Felton, 31, and his 22-year-old girlfriend, Erica Chase.</LD>
<LD>   The couple were arrested in April 2001 when an off-duty police
officer spotted Chase passing a counterfeit $20 bill.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators discovered that Felton was making the phony money to
help fund their plan and already had gathered most of the ingredients
to make a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The defense argued the couple were prosecuted for their beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   They were found guilty of conspiring to make a bomb, conspiring to
make counterfeit bills, obstruction of justice, conspiring to
obstruct justice and firearms violations. Felton was convicted of
making counterfeit bills; Chase was acquitted on that charge.</TE>
<TE>   Felton also was convicted of bank robbery, conspiracy to commit
bank robbery and attempting to receive explosives with the intent to
kill or injure people, or damage property.</TE>
<TE>   Felton faces a minimum of 35 years behind bars. Chase could have
gotten at least eight years if she had been found guilty on all
charges.</TE>

<HD>Tell Students They'll Strike Out With Steroids</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball was rocked when Jose Canseco said 85% of Major League
ballplayers were using steroids to improve their performance. Student
journalist BARBARA MacLAREN spoke with a high school coach about the
use of steroids and how to educate students athletes to their
dangers.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   DENNIS PATRICK</LD>
<TE>   HENDERSON</TE>
<TE>   Varsity baseball coach,</TE>
<TE>   Little Rock High School</TE>
<TE>   I haven't had a problem with my players or fellow coaches using
steroids, but I have played in sports where others have used them.
It's not hard to recognize the symptoms. Players on steroids are more
on edge, have quicker tempers and sweat profusely. I don't know why
anyone would want to do that to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Any player on our team who uses drugs--including steroids--would
be suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Kids have to be educated about the dangers. A major problem is
that steroids increase your heart rate. A player with any type of
minor heart problem could cause himself a major problem.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and coaches should talk to the kids and show them articles
about players who have died from steroid use. Heck, Babe Ruth would
have been one of the fatalities of steroids with his use of tobacco
and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   I regularly talk to my players about steroids. I tell them that
people come to the game to see the human, not the steroid freak.
However, kids look up to professional baseball players and may think
that if it's good for the pro, then it's OK for them.</TE>
<TE>   High school baseball players are curious about the quick fix. They
say to themselves, "Look how big he got in a short time." Then they
start to ask around and usually find out that the negatives outweigh
the positives.</TE>
<TE>   What I try to get across is that the game of baseball should not
be played by people who lack the courage to work hard and acquire the
power and strength the old-fashioned way: Eat right and work hard in
the weight room. The steroid user is cheating himself. In the long
run, if it has a negative effect on his health he has cheated his
future wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   The players who admitted that they were using steroids are out of
the game. That's good. The others who are still playing should try to
experience greatness without steroids. Think about it this way: Would
Babe Ruth's home runs count as much if he had been a steroid freak?</TE>

<HD>Black Schools Hit Hardest by Loss of Teachers</HD>
<DH>Weakened staffs are the main cause of low test scores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY ROSS</AU>
<BD>Randy Ross is vice president for research and policy
development at the Los Angeles County Alliance for Student
Achievement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I graduated from John C. Fremont High School in 1968, back when
graduating was still the norm. The South-Central Los Angeles school's
current sicknesses and failures, described in The Times on July 14,
made me feel almost hopeless. But the worst failure of the Los
Angeles Unified School District is that its broad reforms have not
helped African American students. The causes are complicated but
fixable.</LD>
<LD>   All L.A. schools enjoyed a hefty infusion of resources during the
1990s, that decade of relative plenty. The costliest reform was
smaller classes in kindergarten through third grade in elementary
schools statewide. More recent changes include new reading programs
and teacher coaches.</LD>
<LD>   The overall performance of Los Angeles students on the state's
reading, math and language tests has indeed gone up. Not, however,
for African Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Some say it's because the students are poorer, harder to
discipline and less motivated and their parents are less supportive.
I say hogwash. Studies that follow individual students from year to
year show their test scores going down. The same children, with the
same parents, should improve, not decline, if the school itself is
succeeding.</TE>
<TE>   The district's leaders have tried to turn the focus to the high
performance of first-graders--despite the fact that California does
not even test first-graders (the results are too unstable even for
government work).</TE>
<TE>   So how do we explain this Los Angeles puzzle? A recent study by
the Public Policy Institute of California on the effects of the
state's class-size reduction program opens a window. One of the
seemingly odd findings was that "an analysis of fifth-grade
achievement showed that class-size reduction in third grade led to
lower achievement in fifth grade for schools with a high percentage
of black students."</TE>
<TE>   It appears that class-size reduction in Los Angeles schools led
many experienced fourth- and fifth-grade teachers to switch to the
smaller primary-grade classes. More important, many teachers in
predominantly African American schools left for other schools once
the class-size reductions created openings in every elementary school
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The mass exits and internal reshuffling of teachers in inner-city
schools overwhelmed the benefits of the new programs.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, according to the study, math scores in the LAUSD's
predominantly African American elementary schools went down by 15%
from 1997-98 through 1999-2000, while math scores for similar schools
in California's next five largest districts went up by 15%. Add to
that the more recent year-to-year data and the continuing trend is
clear.</TE>
<TE>   More or different reading and math programs would not help. What
these schools need are great teachers. The schools need to offer
higher salaries to attract nationally certified teacher coaches and
offer an atmosphere in which teachers can work together on a daily
basis to improve themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers must possess not only knowledge but fluid
understanding of content, be eager to teach African American
students, be willing to master strategies for teaching these children
and continually evaluate students' needs.</TE>
<TE>   One more initiative for closing the teacher gap is working its way
through the district. But judging by the grim past, it is hard to
count on the LAUSD.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the California Legislative Black Caucus, whose
districts include schools that are falling the furthest
backward--such as Fremont, Locke and Jordan high schools and the
middle and elementary schools that feed into them--can help by
monitoring other proposed state legislation on education. For
instance, one current proposal would require every high school
student to have access to a college prep curriculum. Schools would
scramble for more math and English teachers and they would be
siphoned off, again, from African American schools. The fix is to
direct the reforms first to the schools with the greatest need.</TE>
<TE>   If African American children in Los Angeles schools don't get
better teachers, they will continue to fail. This is a position that
the teachers union needs to embrace.</TE>
<TE>   The choice is whether African American students, at Fremont and
elsewhere, will have a future.</TE>

<LD>Re "Medical Disciplinary Actions," July 23: I would hope that the
overwhelming majority of practicing doctors who daily and
unstintingly provide health care to those in need would be as
disappointed as this citizen with the "slap 'em on the wrist"
disciplinary measures taken by the Medical Board of California. To so
lightly treat these malpractitioners is in itself a form of
malpractice. Come on, docs, put those scalpels to work and excise the
rotten apples!</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I read with great interest "Teens Get a Second Chance at Literacy"
(July 21), on the "Language!" program being used in the Los Angeles
Unified School District. I used the program this past year with
sixth-graders who were two or more years below grade level in reading
at the school where I teach in La Mirada. I am an ardent supporter of
the program. Students reading at the second- or third-grade level in
high school have lots of holes in their literacy education and do
need to go back to the beginning to fill them in.</LD>
<LD>   Several of my students and their parents were reticent about
reading stories and working on skills that seemed too "babyish" for
sixth-graders, so I am sure in high school the reticence is even
stronger. However, nothing is more important than getting students to
read at the appropriate level. Doing nothing and allowing students to
continue to be unable to read "Romeo and Juliet" and other great
works of literature when they graduate would be a real tragedy.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James McPartland of Johns Hopkins University seems to think that
"almost every child of [high-school] age can sound out words."
Unfortunately, he is mistaken. Time and time again, in my ninth-grade
classes at Jefferson High School, I have watched students struggle
with texts and give up in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Students who come to high school with a first- to third-grade
reading level almost always lack basic decoding skills, especially if
they are asked to attack a sentence or word list at a fluent-reader
rate of speed. They need extra help and practice to be able to attack
"real reading in real books." The "Language!" program gives them the
practice to build those skills. Students are able to practice
independent reading, at their level, using a program called
Accelerated Reader. In addition, teachers read "real books" out loud
to model fluency and then discuss the literary elements of those
books with their students, thereby practicing critical thinking
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Language!" is not a phonics program, though it does have elements
of phonemic awareness. It addresses grammar, language mechanics,
semantic relationships, vocabulary development, morphology, syntax,
sentence structure, composition and critical thinking skills.
Properly taught, it can make a huge difference for students.</TE>
<TE>   Glenna M. Dumey</TE>
<TE>   National Board Certified</TE>
<TE>   Teacher, Jefferson High School</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD's decision to pump $16 million into phonics for middle
and high school students ignores one of the district's major
problems: poor libraries. Districts and states that have more books
per student in the school library have higher reading scores, even
when other factors, such as poverty, are taken into consideration.
The average school library in the U.S. has 18 books per child.
California is last among states with 12 books per child. The LAUSD
has a dismal six books per child.</TE>
<TE>   For the U.S. as a whole, there is one school librarian for every
900 students. California is last in the U.S., with less than one
school librarian for every 5,000 students. The LAUSD does not fund a
librarian in any of its elementary schools' libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Including some phonics in a basic reading program is a good idea.
It is one way of making texts more comprehensible. However, the
problem readers in the new program have already had phonics
instruction. Remedial readers need lots of interesting and
comprehensible reading material. Because California has one of the
worst public library systems in the country, and because so many poor
readers are children of poverty, this reading material is not easily
available outside of school. Improved school libraries are the only
chance these children have.</TE>

<LD>Re "United We Stand, but We'll Snoop Divided," Commentary, July 22:
Robert Levy has it all wrong! TIPS (the Terrorism Information and
Prevention System) is a great idea. I have a question, though. If I
see a utility person acting suspiciously, should I flag down a UPS or
FedEx driver and ask him or her to call in a report?</LD>
<LD>   However, this is a trivial point and trivia should not prevent
implementation. And what better way to launch the program than with
an example from our glorious leaders?</LD>
<LD>   So, then, anyone notice who went in and out of Vice President Dick
Cheney's office when the energy policy was being drafted?</LD>
<TE>   Tony O'Doherty</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have to agree with the general intent of Levy's piece but I find
the idea that "the administration's motives may indeed be pure"
either ironic or an insult to common sense. All that I can see since
the Florida debacle is duplicity and double standards.</TE>
<TE>   Here is an example: Operation TIPS is designed, according to
Barbara Comstock from the Justice Department, "to allow American
workers to share information they receive in the regular course of
their jobs in public places and areas." Is the White House a public
place? The answer is a resounding "No!" if we trust the Bush
administration and the "purity" of its (patriotically driven) motives
as it now moves to " ... Tighten Loose Lips, Stop Leaks to Media"
(July 21).</TE>
<TE>   If we the people are going to be subjected to snoops, why is the
FBI considering taking the step of using polygraph exams to try to
"plug leaks" on the part of members of Congress and their staffs? I
tend to believe the average Joe in this country is a lot more likely
to be hurt by the "greed" strain of terrorism than any other variety
(religious fundamentalist). The places where we do need to unleash
Operation TIPS, sniffing dogs, snoops and whistle blowers are
precisely in the White House, the halls of Congress and the
boardrooms of corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   What is the definition of "terrorist"? A person who terrorizes or
frightens others (Webster's). How many working class (not oil class!)
people in this country now live in a state of fear because they see
their life's earnings on the chopping block? I would guess that a lot
more people are going to suffer from this feeding frenzy of
"corporate deregulation" than all the tragic victims of Sept. 11 and
all the innocents who lost their lives in the terror in Ireland and
the Middle East put together.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times does it again--with yet another in a series of incredibly
slanted anti-secession pieces, this one camouflaged as a bio on Jeff
Brain (July 22). Brain didn't pay his taxes, accidentally registered
for the wrong party and voted at his office instead of his home.
Shocking! There may even be rumors that he has, on occasion, changed
lanes without signaling. But I'll leave that for tomorrow's
California section.</LD>
<LD>   How about dealing with the facts instead of disparaging the poor
guy, whom you have already ripped apart in previous articles? I want
to know if a smaller city is a better city. Can one councilperson
adequately represent 250,000 people? Can a leader be in contact with
a quarter-million people and not be swayed by special interests and
developers? Or will cutting the size of the city by half make things
better, as they are in Santa Monica, Burbank or Glendale? These are
the questions and answers you should be offering your readers. Leave
the rest to the tabloids.</LD>

<TE>   Are we expected to trust a man who owes thousands in city, state
and federal taxes as a proponent of a new Valley government? Are we
supposed to believe Brain when he says he did not know what political
party he was registered with for five years?</TE>
<TE>   Someone who does not know simple voting registration laws or
feigns ignorance to manipulate them is not someone I would trust when
he tells us that secession will be good for the Valley. If he wants a
place of leadership in any government, he'd better go back and take
some basic political science courses. Anyone who lives in the real
world knows that the creation of a new city does not guarantee
sparkling streets and better government accountability.</TE>
<TE>   The proponents of secession have not provided enough details on
what this is going to cost, and there have been conflicting opinions.
Should we trust this man who cannot balance his own books?</TE>
<TE>   Brain should get his own house in order before telling me I should
move mine to another city. I have lived in the Valley my entire life
and do not want to live in "Camelot." Didn't anyone read the book, or
watch the movie? "Camelot" did not have a happy ending.</TE>

<HD>Law to Cut Auto Emissions Is Just a First Step</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Signs Bill to Cut Greenhouse Gases," July 23: Instead of
spending more millions of dollars on misleading scare tactics, the
auto manufacturers should do the responsible thing and spend those
millions working with the Air Resources Board to come up with
solutions that give us better vehicles to drive. Their disinformation
campaign clearly did not work, since 81% of Californians favor
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as the new law will require.</LD>
<LD>   Further obstructionist measures will merely reinforce the public
perception of American auto makers as being out of touch with reality
and trailing behind foreign manufacturers in leading-edge automotive
technology. The declining market share of the last few years is
irrefutable evidence of that perception. It needs to be reversed, and
the law just passed is a golden opportunity to make that happen.</LD>
<LD>   Paul W. Rosenberger</LD>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Against the big money and protestations of the automobile
manufacturers and other special-interest groups, Gov. Gray Davis did
the right thing by signing AB 1493. We Californians should not have
to wait for legislation. We should wise up and stop buying and
driving monster gas-guzzling, polluting, view-blocking sport utility
vehicles and other unnecessary trucks that are not only more unsafe
than cars and contribute much more than their share of air pollution
but also indirectly contribute more dollars to those countries that
support, either tacitly or explicitly, terrorism against the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   We Californians have been had by the automobile manufacturers,
which could make safer, cleaner SUVs, but don't; by many energy
companies, which benefit financially from the increased consumption
and demand for oil; and by many of our own elected leaders who,
because they have such strong ties to automobile manufacturers and
energy companies, won't act to protect us.</TE>
<TE>   Even AB 1493 won't apply until 2009. That's another seven years of
increasing carbon dioxide emissions from our vehicles. We should take
responsibility for our own health and safety and buy smaller, safer
and cleaner vehicles now.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Schlinger</TE>
<TE>   Toluca Lake</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To no one's surprise, Davis has signed a controversial bill
requiring limits on greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) from
automobiles beginning with the 2009 model year.</TE>
<TE>   These gases are thought to contribute to global warming, although
scientists are far from agreement on the existence and consequences
of global warming.</TE>
<TE>   If the government is serious about reducing carbon dioxide
emissions it can begin now by reducing gridlock on our freeways.
Stop-and-go driving consumes more fuel and generates more carbon
dioxide than free-flowing traffic. As a first step, increase the
capacity of existing freeways by opening carpool lanes to all
automotive traffic. Second, add additional lanes, especially where
jam-ups are frequent. Finally, divide existing transportation
bureaucracies like the Orange County Transportation Authority and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority into highway departments that
are dedicated strictly to roads and mass transit departments that are
dedicated to bus and rail.</TE>
<TE>   The new agencies can be funded according to the number of people
they serve. Thus, if half the people drive their cars and half use
mass transit, transportation funding can be divided 50-50.</TE>

<LD>Re "Culinary Tradition Poses a Health Risk in Hong Kong," July 21:
The Times is reporting a story about the hazards of live-food markets
in Hong Kong, while live markets flourish right here in downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   For more than five years we have begged everyone from the Health
Department and the Department of Fish and Game to the SPCA's Los
Angeles chapter and local politicians to close these filthy, cruel
markets in L.A. and San Francisco. We have shown gruesome videos and
presented scientific evidence about the bacteria inside and outside
of the chickens, fish, toads, turtles and rabbits being sold. Yet
existing laws are not being enforced that would protect animals from
harm and humans from the public health hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Law enforcement and politicians, with the exception of state Sen.
Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), have turned the other way. While in
the Assembly, Kuehl introduced AB 2479 to protect the animals from
the cruelty they suffer in live markets, including no food, no water,
no shade and a horrible slaughter. This law was passed, but not only
is it not being enforced, it is being scoffed at.</LD>
<TE>   Take a trip to Chinatown in L.A. Check out the chickens squashed
in tiny cages, the frogs in filthy water, the turtles upside down,
all awaiting death just so someone can enjoy a tasty bacteria-filled
meal.</TE>

<LD>Re "Adelphia Founder, 2 Sons Are Charged With Fraud," July 25: John
Rigas and his two sons are charged with stealing $1 billion. Retirees
have lost their investments, workers have lost their jobs and
creditors are left holding the bag, hoping to get a few pennies on
the dollar. The Rigases are looking at 15 1/2 to 19 1/2 years, if
convicted. What do crack addicts in New York City get? What about the
"three strike" petty-theft cases in California? Is there a two-tier
system of justice in a democracy?</LD>

<TE>   If the Bush administration really wanted to make a statement to
restore confidence in Wall Street and corporate America, we'd see
former Enron head Kenneth Lay in handcuffs. Hundreds lost their jobs
and retirement accounts but not a word about his greed and
wrongdoing. Maybe the Texas oil connection is too deep.</TE>

<TE>   Re "It's About Time for a Little Payback," Commentary, July 22:</TE>
<TE>   While we were distracted by "outside terrorists," our very own
American-made, home-grown white-collar terrorists were cleaning out
our wallets, destroying our children's college funds and gobbling up
our retirement nest eggs for their own personal gain and greed. How
can they look at themselves in the mirror?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, this entire group should "pay back," dearly, for the rest
of their lives, since they've ruined the lives of so many. Forcing
them to do time (after many years in prison, of course) in the
"CriminalCorps--From the Greedy to the Needy" is a marvelous idea.</TE>

<TE>   Jennifer Grossman's slogan needs some modification. Instead of
"From the Greedy to the Needy" it should be "From Greedy to Needy,"
or "Poverty as Punishment." A walk in the park watering the flowers
is no punishment. Leaving these people in the environment that
sheltered them by having them brainstorm for corporate solutions is
no deterrent. The usual Club Fed prison sentences coupled with
Grossman's community service idea does not serve justice. The specter
of 20 years to life served in poverty, for those found guilty, would
be a powerful incentive for them to more carefully consider their
actions.</TE>

<TE>   Grossman's opinion shows the root cause of the problem. Somehow,
there's a societal disconnect between street crime and white-collar
crime. If a thief is convicted three times in California, it's a
mandatory life sentence in state prison--even though the dollar
amount may not be great and there were very few people directly
harmed. However, if a corporate executive thief manipulates the
books, enriches himself and destroys a company, its employees, its
pensioners, its shareholders, its creditors and investors in general
to the tune of billions of dollars, Grossman recommends he do
community service.</TE>
<TE>   I doubt anyone from Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen or ImClone
will ever serve hard time.</TE>

<TE>   The only consolation I have, as a small-time stock investor
watching my money disappear, is the emerging realization that my
fellow small-time investors across the aisle must be reaching the
point of view that "all Republicans are created equal--but some
Republicans are more equal than others." (With apologies to George
Orwell.)</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since Alan Greenspan and President Bush report that the economy is
basically healthy and even ready for more expansion and the drag on
the stock market is the doing of only a few corporate offenders, this
might help restore investor confidence: Have all Fortune 500 chief
executives sign a statement assuring investors that no accounting
fraud or other wrongdoings have occurred on their watch and publish
it in all major U.S. newspapers. And if not, why not?</TE>

<TE>   In "Connect the Dots for a Disturbing Picture" (Opinion, July 21),
Todd Gitlin displays a commendable lack of moral relativism and some
impressive intellectual clarity. ("The people in power represent an
economic clique whose interests are only superficially tied to the
well-being of the country as a whole.") The ghastly events of 9/11
seemed to have temporarily blinded our populace to the exceptional
corruption (even by today's standards) of the current administration.
Sadly, it is only by having our retirement pockets so egregiously
picked that we have begun to come to our senses.</TE>
<TE>   Wake up, folks. The crony capitalism and economic terrorism of fat
cats like Vice President Dick Cheney, Bush, Army Secretary Thomas
White, Sen. Phil Gramm and others pose a far greater long-term danger
to our republic than Osama bin Laden and his demented minions.</TE>
