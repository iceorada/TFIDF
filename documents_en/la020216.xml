<LD>"I want to welcome you all to a wonderful night of love...."</LD>
<LD>   Teddy Pendergrass still knows how to set a mood. At the Wiltern
Theatre on Thursday, he was a loverman as passionate and convincing
as Al Green or Barry White, singing soulful love songs and party
tunes that resonated as deeply as ever.</LD>
<LD>   That hasn't changed, despite a 1982 car accident that left the
Philadelphia-based singer in a wheelchair. If anything, Pendergrass'
performance suggested that he has found inspiration with the
accelerating rebirth of his live performing career.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's rare Los Angeles appearance came near the end of six
months on and off the road. The 75-minute concert opened with "Joy,"
his 1986 comeback hit single. It was slick, funky R&amp;B, but the song
gained infinite depth from Pendergrass' delivery, rich with palpable
feelings of warmth and excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his limited mobility, Pendergrass never stopped moving,
bobbing excitedly to the beats, raising an arm, talking to fans. His
sidemen handed out teddy bears to women in the audience, and
Pendergrass invited a woman onstage for a romantic serenade.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned to her Valentine's Day date, Pendergrass smiled
and said, "All right, brother. It's on you now,"  a light sermon  on
romance.</TE>
<TE>   After finding fame as a member of Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes,
Pendergrass began a solo career that bridged a gap between classic
'70s soul and the highly polished R&amp;B of the early '80s. But his own
music rarely succumbed to formulas, never lost the fire of such early
Blue Notes hits as "If You Don't Know Me by Now."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Pendergrass on Thursday outshined his original
recordings. He also thanked the audience for helping him demonstrate
how his musical life remained unrestrained. By then, the case was
already made.</TE>

<HD>Harvey Closes the Book on Sitcom</HD>
<DH>Television: 'The Steve Harvey Show' ends its run Sunday,
leaving the actor-comedian feeling both pride and regret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six years, school is finally out for Steve Harvey.</LD>
<LD>   And he couldn't feel prouder.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm walking away on my own terms," the actor-comedian said last
week, before Sunday's final episode of "The Steve Harvey Show," the
WB network comedy set at an inner-city high school.</LD>
<TE>   "We lasted six years, we're doing well in syndication and I know
this is the best half-hour [series] that the WB has ever had."</TE>
<TE>   The program, featuring Harvey as a former 1970s R&amp;B singer who
moves from music teacher to vice principal, helped establish Harvey
as a comedy force to be reckoned with.</TE>
<TE>   It was his decision to end the show after six years--once there
were enough reruns to play on local TV stations--while it still
possessed a small but loyal audience (about 3 million viewers per
week), saying he wanted to pursue other projects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to starring on the show, Harvey also became a
top-rated local radio personality on KBBT-FM (100.3) the Beat, and
drew praise for "The Original Kings of Comedy" concert tour and
related documentary from filmmaker Spike Lee. He's also earned
several NAACP Image Awards, including last year's entertainer of the
year honor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Harvey said it is the series that has had the most impact
on his career.</TE>
<TE>   "The show put me in people's houses, which was very important," he
said. "I grew from being just a stand-up to being on this great show.
It really had a profound effect."</TE>
<TE>   However, Harvey also exits the TV scene with mixed feelings,
saying there are aspects of the business of television that he is
ready to leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't miss getting notes from the network, or the long hours of
taping and rehearsal," he said, adding that he wished the network
would have had more trust in his vision. (The WB is part-owned by
Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   "This show was never from the Steve Harvey point of view, which I
thought the show was supposed to be," Harvey said. "There are so many
issues I would have like to have tackled, such as teen pregnancy or
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "But they didn't want to do that. They felt it would be too heavy
for a comedy. They said, 'The numbers are great, let's not mess with
it.' I disagree. You can make anything funny."</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said he was also distressed that the WB "moved our show to
a different night each season. Still, people found it. In hindsight,
the network did what they had to do. It's water over the dam now. I'm
all about positive."</TE>
<TE>   Network executives said several of the WB's African American
comedies, including Harvey's show, were moved en masse to different
nights as a programming strategy and pointed out that Harvey was able
to tackle serious issues, such as the East Coast-West Coast rap
rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Turell, a spokesman for the Turner Broadcasting networks,
said the WB is currently looking for another strong African American
personality "that can be the center of a show." In addition to
Harvey's show, the network's other remaining sitcom with African
American leads, "For Your Love," will also end its run this year.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey said he will greatly miss working with the show's creator
and executive producer, Winifred Hervey, executive producer and
director Stan Lathan and a cast that included Wendy Raquel Robinson,
Terri J. Vaughn and Cedric "The Entertainer," who played coach Cedric
Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   Hervey added that the show brought "a bit of sophistication" to
the genre of African American sitcoms, which have been criticized in
the past for being too stereotypical or cartoonish.</TE>
<TE>   "All the characters had a lot of dignity, even though they
approached things differently," she said. "There were no weak people
on the show. And I felt all the actors did really good work."</TE>
<TE>   The show marks Harvey's second TV project, and he remains bitter
about the fate of his first project, ABC's "Me and the Boys." The
1994 series cast Harvey as a widower raising three young sons.
Despite the fact that it was the network's highest-rated new show (it
benefited from being sandwiched between "Full House" and "Roseanne"),
it was not renewed for a second season.</TE>
<TE>   "That was simply an injustice," Harvey said with a noticeable
edge. "How do you explain that? It would have been a great show. 'Me
and the Boys' is the only show I would come back to television to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Harvey has plenty of other projects on his plate.</TE>
<TE>   Syndication of his radio show to other cities is on the horizon.
Urban Works Entertainment has just released a DVD of his stand-up
act. He also has a music compilation album featuring Carl Thomas,
Angie Stone and other R&amp;B artists.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty to do, and it's all good," Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Steve Harvey Show" finale airs Sunday night at 7:30 on the
WB. The network has rated it TV-PG-D (may be unsuitable for young
children, with an advisory for suggestive dialogue).</TE>

<HD>Young Conductor Makes Strong L.A. Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever awaiting their big opportunity, assistant conductors of major
symphonic organizations must pray for debut chances. For 33-year-old
Yasuo Shinozaki, that opportunity came Thursday night, when he
deputized for the ill Hans Vonk and led the Los Angeles Philharmonic
in a Beethoven program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Since joining the orchestra at the beginning of last summer, the
Japan-born and Vienna-trained conductor has led the orchestra in a
series of community concerts and in the Symphonies for Youth program.
The Thursday night performance, which will be repeated through
Sunday, marked his first appearance with the orchestra in a
subscription series concert. Shinozaki handled it with aplomb.</LD>
<LD>   In a program encompassing the Third "Leonore" Overture, the
G-major Piano Concerto--with soloist Andre Watts--and the "Pastoral"
Symphony, the young conductor made a strong impression, proved
imperturbable and enforced orderly, well-contrasted and motivated
performances from his colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   The concerto showed Shinozaki at his best, collaborating smoothly
with Watts' patrician pianism and sculptured reading, holding the
orchestra in check while giving it room for expression, keeping the
shape of the work clear. The total unfolded logically and
effortlessly.</TE>
<TE>   The Sixth Symphony emerged with its inner workings supporting its
familiar, grand superstructure. Each movement was given its
character, and each moved solidly forward. The audience, informed of
Shinozaki's debut via an insert in the program, seemed to have
developed a new affection when it came to the young conductor.
Standing ovations followed the piano concerto and the "Pastoral."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Philharmonic, Yasuo Shinozaki conducting, repeats this
program tonight at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., L.A., $12 to $78. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>Lou Rawls Is Still Easy on the Ears--and Soul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thursday was Valentine's Day, so it was inevitable that Lou Rawls
would sing "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine" at some point
during his evening set at the Cerritos Center for the Performing
Arts. The only question was when he would get around to the Gamble &amp;
Huff soul classic.</LD>
<LD>   When he did, the full-house audience--with Valentine red the most
popular color choice for concert attire--let out a collective sigh of
relief.</LD>
<LD>   It took Rawls half the program to get to the hit number, but that
was OK, since he had already acknowledged the holiday with romantic
tunes from the appropriately sweet sentiments of "My Funny Valentine"
to the lusty suggestiveness of "Fine Brown Frame."</LD>
<TE>   Hearing Rawls sing is a bit like slipping on a comfortable pair of
old loafers and propping one's feet up on a hassock.</TE>
<TE>   His voice, with its unique timbre and the emotional catch, is one
of the great warm-and-fuzzy sounds of pop and jazz music. He used it
with great effectiveness on other ballads too, especially with tunes
not ordinarily associated with him, such as "Send in the Clowns" and
"Pure Imagination."</TE>
<TE>   But Rawls, whose roots are deeply embedded in the blues of his
Chicago hometown, is a superb rhythm singer as well.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkled throughout his set was a wide-ranging collection of
blues, occasionally in medleys, including both "Goin' to Chicago" and
"Goin' to Kansas City," as well as the classic "Stormy Monday Blues."</TE>
<TE>   He honored his close friendship and musical association with Sam
Cooke (who was briefly his manager) via a grouping of three Cooke
classics: "You Send Me"; "Wonderful World" (perhaps best known for
its repeated phrase, "Don't know much about ... "); and "Bring It on
Home to Me" (which was a duet with Rawls in the original Cooke hit
recording).</TE>
<TE>   And he wrapped the evening with a romping, hard-swinging rendition
of Willie Dixon's "Hootchie Coochie Man," enlivened by his five-piece
backup band and the wildly imaginative guitar work of David T.
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   For the Valentine's Day celebrants in the audience, it was a
performance with plenty of romantic moments.</TE>
<TE>   For the music lovers, it was Rawls at his best, proving in tune
after tune that good singing can stand on its own, without benefit of
smoke machines, laser beams, high-decibel sound or wiggling backup
singers.</TE>

<LD>Talk About a Make-Over: "In New York, a former Rockette is suing her
bosses at Radio City Music Hall because she claims they used her
picture on promotional merchandise without her permission. She also
claims they changed her teeth, her eyes, her nose, her hair and her
eyebrows and then placed her head on a different body. How does she
know it's her? How do you sue for that? ... Imagine--they took her
head and put it on somebody else's body. Today, Cher said, 'You can
do that? That's possible? Can I get that done?'" (Jay Leno)</LD>
<LD>   Heads Up: "A passenger recently forced his way into the cockpit of
a flight from Miami but was subdued after the co-pilot hit him with a
small ax. Good to see our airlines are being kept secure by the
latest in 12th century technology." (Dennis Miller)</LD>
<LD>   So He Says: "In a statement before the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, Mike Tyson recently said, 'I'm not Mother Teresa, but I'm
not Charles Manson either.' ... Of course, whether he's Hannibal
Lecter is another question." (Paul Steinberg)</LD>

<LD>Here's a real tough one for your readers: "Shakespeare in Love" is to
"Saving Private Ryan" as "Moulin Rouge" is to what movie?</LD>
<LD>   Admittedly, "Black Hawk Down" is "disquieting" (Kenneth Turan's
word), but is that really why a piece of obnoxious fluff received a
best picture Academy Award nomination in its stead?</LD>
<LD>   I wouldn't exactly call "In the Bedroom" uplifting.</LD>
<TE>   Could it be that industry folks just found it too distasteful to
honor a film that celebrates values so alien and repugnant to them?
The message that "Black Hawk Down" sends so clearly--that our way of
life must sometimes be defended with force and that those who fight
on our behalf deserve our thanks--is truly a disquieting one for
Hollywood.</TE>

<TE>   The academy deserves high praise in its selection of the nominees
in that they were able to stay awake while judging "Moulin Rouge." Or
maybe they didn't, and that was the problem.</TE>

<TE>   Though "Gosford Park" was a wonderful movie, I question Robert
Altman being nominated for best director. One wonders why all that
great talent was assembled for the film when some played such minimal
roles. Probably the most egregious example of this was Derek Jacobi,
a great actor who, I don't believe, had more than two lines.</TE>

<TE>   Once again, the academy's documentary branch displays its usual
dubious expertise and denies even a nomination to what was clearly
the year's best documentary. For many, "Martin Scorsese's 'My Voyage
to Italy'" was not only the year's best documentary but the year's
best film. Period.</TE>
<TE>   This beautiful four-hour cinematic history lesson brought tears to
my eyes, as it reminded me again and again of the potential power and
beauty of the cinema, from the days when some people still treated
movies as an art form.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the documentary branch didn't do its homework.</TE>

<LD>I recently had the opportunity to see an advance screening of the new
Denzel Washington film, "John Q," the story of a blue-collar family
whose insurance won't cover their son's heart transplant. Not only
did the film have more expository dialogue than the owner's manual
for the space shuttle, it was a slap in the face for any American
without adequate health insurance, myself included.</LD>
<LD>   One of the lessons learned in becoming an adult is that life is
full of hypocrisy. This is especially true in the entertainment
industry. As a member of the human race and of the entertainment
industry, I accept that. But this film and the filmmakers are so
hypocritical, J. Edgar Hoover looks like a straight shooter in
comparison. In truth, it would be laughable if it were not so cruel.</LD>
<LD>   The film serves up a litany of facts and figures to drive home the
point of how terrible the American health-care system is--a fact many
of us know all too well. Without insurance in America, you cannot get
the care you need. Without a full-time job, you are not eligible for
complete coverage, and that's if your employer even offers health
insurance.</LD>
<TE>   The hypocrisy of all this is that the film was shot in Canada.
Hey, caring filmmakers, how many men and women here in Southern
California will not qualify for benefits this year because they were
unable to work the required hours to be eligible? Did anyone on the
set even think of this when the lead character complains he cannot
get enough hours because so many jobs have gone to Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   As a person who works in the film industry and has not qualified
for insurance for years, this was nothing more than adding salt to an
open wound. An injury I am sure insurance doesn't cover.</TE>

<TE>   For all the space (a front-page article) and high-flown rhetoric
(a positively fawning review) you gave to "Shiri" ("A Korean
Detente," by Jon Matsumoto, Feb. 8; "'Shiri' Captures Political
Intrigue's Toll," by Kevin Thomas, Feb. 8), you left something out:
the mind-numbing, gratuitous violence displayed in this film.</TE>
<TE>   This is irresponsible journalism. No matter how afraid critics Jon
Matsumoto and Kevin Thomas are of being considered less than "edgy"
and hopelessly out of touch with the latest from young foreign
filmmakers, they are responsible for giving their readers all the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   SYLVIA ALLOWAY</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What enticed me to pay good money to see "Collateral Damage" was a
snippet of dialogue in the trailer: An authoritative figure demands
of Arnold (slight paraphrasing here), "Whatever you do, don't take
the law into your own hands." To which Arnold Schwarzenegger replies
with a hint of sarcasm (given the context), "Thanks for the advice."</TE>
<TE>   The content of this exchange led me to believe that Arnold was
going to kick some major tail a la "Dirty Harry." However, when I saw
the movie, the above exchange never took place. Both lines of
dialogue were in the film, but not in connection with each other.
Actually, Arnold's "Thanks for the advice" appeared in a different
scene altogether as a sincere declaration of gratitude to someone
who'd just shared valuable travel tips with him.</TE>
<TE>   It's annoying that this kind of transposition (misrepresentation
might be a better word) has become increasingly common in previews of
coming attractions. Can you imagine my dismay when, instead of
enjoying Dirty Harry, I was subjected to "Weeping Gordy??"</TE>

<LD>Characterizing the simple plot of "Into the Woods" as "excessively
intricate" and "[requiring] an audience to multitask to an unusual
degree" speaks volumes ("An Invigorating Trip," by Don Shirley, Feb.
12). Such characterization clearly suggests that today's audiences
are uneducated or undereducated.</LD>
<LD>   But then, if schools allow watching the Hollywood version of
"Romeo and Juliet" instead of reading the play, and if reading lists
consist of only current, politically correct drivel and if each
student gets to pick a different book so no meaningful class analysis
is possible--then, of course, "Into the Woods" is too complicated.</LD>
<LD>   The information age makes available lots of factoids but,
increasingly and alarmingly, analytical and critical thinking are not
being developed. When all we are doing is "tasking," we are not
"thinking."</LD>

<LD>Last Saturday night I saw the Los Angeles Opera's Mass in B
minor--and my mind still resonates with both the music and the stage
performance. Achim Freyer's production was wonderful, inspiring and
more than a little humbling. Please, let's welcome him back any time.
I have never seen such a brilliant use of lighting, music and
production design. I cannot stop thinking of what I saw and heard.
Congratulations, Los Angeles Opera, for your courage.</LD>

<TE>   It occurred to me after reading Richard Ginell's review of the
L.A. Philharmonic ("Philharmonic's Sure-Fire Mahler," Feb. 4) that
perhaps he heard the Mahler Fifth and the Mozart concerto over the
closed-circuit TV in the second-floor bar of the Dorothy Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   He tells us in a deliberately condescending fashion that the
Mahler was "expertly performed," the orchestral accompaniment for the
Mozart "lush," the soloist's playing "searching." None of this was
adequate to Ginell's high-flown demands.</TE>
<TE>   He should have been sitting fifth row center of the front balcony.
I found new depths in the Mahler and, in the first movement
particularly, I could say that I plunged into those depths, happy
that such glorious music so beautifully played offered some
compensation for the ills that we all must suffer in our time.</TE>
<TE>   My advice is that you all trade in your more expensive tickets (or
leave the bar) and come up where the acoustics for most music are the
best in the house.</TE>

<LD>What astonished me in Michael Sragow's effusive tribute to Marlon
Brando ("Contender? More Like a Champion," Feb. 9) was his failure to
even mention the obvious parallel to Orson Welles.</LD>
<LD>   Both Brando and Welles started out great but soon lost interest
and wound up as 300-pound grotesqueries, devoting the last 30 or 40
years of their lives to overpriced cameo appearances in lousy movies,
working with mediocre directors in projects they openly despised. In
the end, natural talent is not nearly enough; character is finally
what matters.</LD>

The band is a true flashback to the great days of rock, where touring
200 days a year and playing in front of friends were as much fun as
they were business.</LD>
<LD>   O.A.R. has bucked all the trends of modern music and relied on the
one thing that no producer or recording can give them: talent. And by
allowing their shows to be recorded, their talent is being recognized
across the country.</LD>

like Landmark's Nuart Theater, is the salvation of the few remaining
cineastes left here in "movieland." Dennis does himself a gross
disservice by comparing the Nuart's programming (or his own) to that
of the Sunset 5's. The Laemmle theaters only continue the

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Glass sculptures by Dale Chihuly glow in front of Abravanel Hall
across from the Mormon Temple. Outside, his version of the sun and
moon are suspended in midair; inside, a 10-by-27-foot tower,
constructed of steel and 1,118 pieces of twisted red glass, flashes
like frozen fire through the huge windows that front the arts center.
Nearby, members of the American Poetry and Literacy Project dispense
volumes of poetry to spectators, and behind the Gateway shopping
complex downtown the drumming of Native Americans sounds from a
tent-museum of Navajo culture.</LD>
<LD>   One and a half million visitors are expected to flock to Salt Lake
for the XIX Winter Olympics to see the world's elite athletes compete
in events that include skating, snowboarding and skiing. But
organizers of the 2002 Olympic Arts Festival hope that while they are
here, many of them will dip into museum exhibitions, dance
performances, concerts and theater assembled--and in some cases
commissioned--to complement the Games.</LD>
<TE>   In all, the arts festival in Salt Lake City, which runs from Feb.
1 through March 16 (with some exhibitions continuing into September)
includes more than 60 performances, 10 major exhibitions and 50
community programs put together with a budget of $35 million. Of
that, $6 million comes from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee,
raised through private donations. The balance came from the artists
and arts organizations, which put up some or all of the money
required to bring their exhibitions and performances to Salt Lake.
The Lear Family Foundation, for example, paid to bring one of only 25
surviving original copies of the Declaration of Independence for
display in the rotunda of the state capitol.</TE>
<TE>   The link between the Games and the arts goes back to the Olympics'
origins in ancient Greece, scholars say. The Pythian Games held in
Delphi in 580 B.C. included a music competition between citizen
soldiers, according to Raymond T. Grant, director of this year's arts
festival, and flutists played in the Olympic stadium to give javelin
throwers their rhythm. A terra-cotta vase buried in an Athenian grave
decorated with a poem describes a 740 B.C. dancing contest that
historians are "pretty sure" was related to the Olympic tradition,
says Grant: "He who dances most nimbly of all take this [vase] as
your prize."</TE>
<TE>   The modern Olympic charter mandates some sort of cultural
festival, but Grant says historians argue about when precisely the
cultural component was included. From 1906 to 1948, Olympic athletes
actually competed for medals in artistic competitions, such as
sculpture and literature. In more recent Olympiads, the cultural
component has taken the form of performances and exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   "The only specificity that the International Olympic Committee
charter gives us is to present programs that are of interest to those
competing in the Olympic Games," Grant said. Grant took on the job of
organizing the 2002 festival in July 1998, moving to Salt Lake City
from Florida, where he headed the performing arts and film
programming team of the Disney Institute in Orlando. He had
previously served as general manager of the American Symphony
Orchestra in New York City and directed the Tisch Center for the Arts
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said no single previous Olympic Arts Festival served as a
model for Salt Lake's, but he instead chose successful aspects from a
number of them. From Atlanta, who hosted the Summer Games in 1996, he
took the idea of creating one major art exhibition as a focal point;
in Salt Lake that takes the form of Chihuly's four commissioned glass
sculptures and the accompanying exhibit downtown. From Sydney he
learned that cultural activities should be centrally located, and
free transportation should be linked to tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, his goal was to create a festival that would showcase the
art of the host country and geographic region. "These programs define
the atmosphere of the Games," Grant said. "Artists define a sense of
place. I believe that the cultural programming will be the flavor
that visitors will leave with."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Grant said, he hopes the festival will debunk some
of the myths of the American West. "A survey of European tourists
showed that less than 4% even know Utah is a state," Grant said.
"European visitors expect to land at the airport and be greeted by
cowboys and Indians."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Fitzpatrick, now the head of the Chicago Museum of
Contemporary Art, directed the ambitious and successful Los Angeles
Olympic Arts Festival in 1984. He used it as a platform to piggyback
culture onto the appeal of sports.</TE>
<TE>   "What I wanted to do was use the Olympics, which are popular,
accessible, and don't sound so highbrow, to seduce people into
performances and museums," says Fitzpatrick. "People thought, 'It
can't be that off-putting, or avant-garde if it has the Olympics
label.'"</TE>
<TE>   Grant, too, said he is proud of introducing the Salt Lake
community to artists they may not have seen before. Indeed,
organizers strove to keep ticket prices affordable so that locals
could attend. That local interest has been reflected to date in
ticket sales. As of Feb. 14, Grant said the Olympic Arts Festival was
on track to sell 92% of the total tickets available. He said about
three-quarters of those were bought by residents who live within a
45-minute drive of Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Create a Bit of a Laboratory'</TE>
<TE>   "What we have tried to do is create a bit of a laboratory, not to
have artists who would blow in, do a gig, and leave town," Grant
said, defining the difference between his cultural programming and
the nightly pop music concerts at Olympic Medals Plaza, or the pomp
and flash of the opening ceremony, neither of which is part of the
cultural festival. "Connected to that is the commissioning of new
work. I doubt the Bare Naked Ladies introduced any new material."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Chihuly commission, Grant cites a number of dance
works as evidence of the new work on display: Judith Jamison's
one-act jazz suite for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre, based on the
life of 1980s track champion Florence Griffith Joyner, and a new work
by contemporary Pilobolus Dance Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "The heart of this is that the artists will own the work," he
said. "If the works were done for the opening ceremonies, they would
end up locked in the Olympic Museum [in Lausanne, Switzerland]. This
is the only way to help artists' works become part of the
repertoire."</TE>
<TE>   Other festival highlights include the "Utah's First Nation"
exhibition at the Utah Museum of Natural History, a multimedia look
at eight tribal cultures from the Navajo to Ute. At the University of
Utah Marriott Library, near the stadium where the opening ceremonies
were held, an exhibit assembled by the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., details the controversial history of the 1936
Olympics in Berlin, including Nazi origins of the Olympic torch
tradition in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   The festival also showcases other aspects of U.S. and Utah local
color, with programs by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, cowboy poets and
a full-scale professional rodeo. A warehouse of the work of Utah
artists is open in Springville about a 30-minute drive from downtown
Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a quarter of the tickets to art performances have gone
to Olympic visitors so far, and Grant says athletes tend to be "more
interested in television and video games than Ailey," but he hopes
the festival will do its job for visitors and locals.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of the activity they came to see ends at 4:30," Grant
said of the Olympic spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "When night falls, with the exception of those watching ice
skating, they will be looking for things to do."</TE>

<LD>   Willis Wins This Year's Harvard Pudding Pot</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Willis was wearing a wig and gold glitter bra Thursday night
when he was crowned Harvard's Hasty Pudding Man of the Year.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't seen this many men dressed in women's clothing since my
bachelor party," Willis quipped after two undergraduates dressed in
drag presented him with the brass pudding pot.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with tradition, members of the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals, an undergraduate dramatic organization, didn't let
Willis off easy.</TE>
<TE>   They forced him to re-enact a scene from "Die Hard," the action
film that made him a star. He had to remove his shoes, pull a
bloodstained tank top over his tuxedo and run across bubble wrap--a
sendup of the scene in which he runs barefooted over broken glass.</TE>

<TE>   'Lagaan' Grants India  a 'Proud Moment'</TE>
<TE>   The cast and crew of the Indian film "Lagaan" cheered wildly on
hearing that the Bollywood musical had been nominated for an Oscar
this week in the best foreign language film category.</TE>
<TE>   Only two other Indian films have been nominated for an Academy
Award: "Mother India" in 1957 and "Salaam Bombay" in 1988. Neither
won.</TE>
<TE>   "We went wild," said Ashutosh Gowariker, the director of "Lagaan,"
which means "tax" in Hindi.</TE>
<TE>   He said the cast and crew held a celebration at the Bombay home of
Aamir Khan, the film's producer and leading man. Said Khan: "It is a
proud moment for every Indian."</TE>

<TE>   Amnesty International is joining the fray of high-profile
post-Oscar parties. Details will be sent around town next week, but
Bonnie Abaunza, who heads the nonprofit's artists relations office,
said it is part of a strategy to rejuvenate interest in the

<TE>   'Colin Quinn' Hobnobs With NBC Celebrities</TE>
<TE>   NBC will sandwich the March 11 premiere of "The Colin Quinn Show"
between a 90-minute installment of "Fear Factor" and an hourlong
tribute to the late comedian John Belushi.</TE>
<TE>   The half-hour show starring Quinn, a former writer and performer
on "Saturday Night Live," will feature a monologue, sketch comedy
elements and guest appearances, NBC said.</TE>
<TE>   Its first telecast will be preceded by a celebrity edition of
"Fear Factor," featuring singer Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet
Boys and actors Stephen Baldwin and Alison Sweeney. "Quinn" will be
followed by the Belushi tribute, marking the 20th anniversary of his
death, to be hosted by Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon of "Saturday Night

<TE>   Perfect Attendance Doesn't Matter to 'Lady'</TE>
<TE>   Martine McCutcheon, who made headlines for frequently missing
performances in her starring theater debut, has won an Olivier Award
for her performance as Eliza Doolittle in the London revival of "My
Fair Lady."</TE>
<TE>   The win was as surprising as the shutout for the revival of "Kiss
Me, Kate," which had been nominated for nine Oliviers. It lost the
award for best musical production to "My Fair Lady," which also was
honored for its choreography, by Matthew Bourne.</TE>
<TE>   Winners of the British equivalent of Broadway's Tony Awards were
announced Friday by the Society of London Theater.</TE>
<TE>   In another unexpected vote, best play honors went to August
Wilson's "Jitney," an American import that briefly played the
National during the fall.</TE>
<TE>   The favorite for that award was a competing National entry,
Charlotte Jones' "Humble Boy," which was honored for Marcia Warren's
supporting performance.</TE>

<TE>   Now, some in the Panhandle town are working to turn the abandoned
Harris Drug Store into a tribute to Guthrie, who wrote "This Land Is

<HD>Framing Light Without Heat</HD>
<DH>Luminous photographs by Richard Ross are exquisite but as
coolly dispassionate in content as their square format would suggest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Photographs can be made without good reason, without any ostensible
subject and without much care or sensibility, but they can't be made
without light. Light is the catalyst, the engine, the fuel of every
photographic image. It can be present in artificial or natural form,
but it must be present. It delivers the wake-up call to slumbering
silver salts or, nowadays, to the dormant codes of digital "film."</LD>
<LD>   In the group of Richard Ross photographs on view at the Orange
County Museum of Art, light is both reason and subject. For the last
10 years, Ross has used the camera like a straight pin on a corkboard
to collect specimens of light. Each is exquisite and unique, but for
all the passion requisite in their collection, these luminous
incidents come across as coolly dispassionate in their display.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the two dozen color prints is large enough (about 4 feet
on each side) and vivid enough to feel like a physical invitation.
The architectural spaces feel nearly continuous with our own space;
we stand, it seems, at the edge of each room, at the cusp of each
passageway. The spaces themselves are largely vacant except for
light--in beams, throbs, flickers, searing fields and radiant pools.</LD>
<TE>   Ross shot the Temple of Ananda in Bagan, Myanmar, from the
outside, where its sooty, stone-carved exterior dramatically offsets
a golden passageway inside. The stairway down, with its ceiling of
receding pointed arches, radiates golden light. It beckons with
warmth and promise.</TE>
<TE>   The delicately tiled bath at the Red Fort of Delhi is pictured
with solemnity and something akin to reverence. All is dim and still
but for a dusting of light that drifts to the floor in a circular
pattern of dots, like powdered sugar sifted through a doily.</TE>
<TE>   Ross' photographs of a cathedral in Spain, a temple in Laos, an
ancient bath in Israel and a fresco-lined chamber in Pompeii are
similarly still and pristine, haunted as much as vivified by light.
Nearly half of the images represent sacred spaces where,
paradoxically, light makes palpable the spiritual function of the
place.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the pictures in the show, which originated at the
Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky., frame spaces of a different
sort, museums mostly, but also a ferry landing in Italy and a storage
room at a movie studio.</TE>
<TE>   Ross has been photographing in art and natural history museums
since the 1970s. As repositories of cultural and historical meaning,
those institutions might be considered sacred spaces. Ross has long
tempered his reverence with canny humor, irony and an overall sense
of disjunction that teases prickly questions out of even the most
orderly, placid environment.</TE>
<TE>   The museum pictures here have little spark, however. A gallery at
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu (Ross is principal photographer
for the museum's Villa Project and the Getty Conservation Institute)
is empty but for a puddle of white light on the hardwood floor. The
image is spare but underwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more intriguing is a view of a room in the Getty Villa
under repair, where rubble heaps around a hole in the floor, a secret
shaft to a mysterious underworld.</TE>
<TE>   A few photographs hint at faded glory by quietly exposing surface
decay in the museums' otherwise elegant settings. These and some
behind-the-scenes shots reveal a certain messiness at odds with the
polished facades that museums typically present to the public.</TE>
<TE>   These pictures, though, lack the savory friction of his earlier
museum work. They also fall short of the harmonious beauty of the
images of sacred sites, falling instead into a visual limbo of the
big, beautiful and benign.</TE>
<TE>   The show, "Gathering Light," is accompanied by a catalog with a
pithy introduction by Dave Hickey and a provocative essay by Eduardo
Cadava. But Ross' pictures (also on view at the museum's South Coast
Plaza gallery) have a hard time measuring up to the writers'
poeticizing.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of their grand scale, the photographs, even of sacred
sites, feel slight. Regardless of their concentration on the
ephemeral, fleeting, intensifying power of light, both their
insistent frontality and their square format make the pictures appear
static. Light is all that's needed to make a photograph, but it's not
enough: necessary but not sufficient.</TE>

<HD>The Cultural Component</HD>
<DH>Sports-infused dance pieces abound at the Olympic Arts
Festival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Wearing layers of black except for immaculate white sneakers, Judith
Jamison climbs out of a van in front of the Capitol Theatre and
dances a few fast, playful steps on the icy street.</LD>
<LD>   A former star of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and now
the company's artistic director, she is one of the dance world's most
articulate advocates. But dance isn't the first thing she wants to
talk about when she meets a visitor inside a theater conference room.</LD>
<LD>   Today Jamison is caught up in Olympic fever and is still glowing
from her participation in the torch relay the day before the opening
ceremonies. "I carried it 0.2 miles," she explains. "Norman Lear gave
it to me, and I gave it to Kristi Yamaguchi."</LD>
<TE>   Jamison is one of the choreographers commissioned by the Olympic
Arts Festival to create a work to be danced during the 2002 Winter
Games. Like many of her fellow dance-makers, she came from an
athletic background, is inspired by athletes and incorporates
movement associated with sports in her Olympic commission.</TE>
<TE>   But even though dancers and athletes represent twin icons of
physical fitness and splendor in our culture, Jamison and her
colleagues recognize that deep distinctions exist between what
dancers and athletes do and how we view them. It isn't just a matter
of medals or choreographed versus spontaneous achievement. For
Jamison, the worlds of dance and sports divide over the use of time.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes annihilate time, she says, where dancers manipulate and
sometimes seem to suspend it: "If you're a sprinter, you have to do
in 8.6 seconds or less what we sustain for 21/2 hours."</TE>
<TE>   "It's phenomenal that they can produce a burst of energy like
that," she exclaims. "But, for me, their fire, sports fire, burns too
fast. I like to float on a cloud and be there for a minute and then
burn and do everything that comes in between. And athletes don't get
a chance to do that."</TE>
<TE>   It's movement specialization that separates dance and sports,
according to Joan Woodbury, the co-artistic director of Utah's
Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company. "Athletes train for just one skill and
for an incredible amount of perfection in it. Dancers train for
perfection, too, but we also train for quality of movement, to get
nuances and new movement material that we've never done before."</TE>
<TE>   Woodbury and Jamison both choreographed works for the Olympics
with unmistakable sports connections. But where Jamison's "HERE ...
NOW." evokes the career and personal style of 1980s track champion
Florence Griffith Joyner, Woodbury's "Ready, Set!" celebrates
athletes en masse: "I have sections in which you're seeing all of the
sports at once, the moguls, the ice skating, the distance skiing,"
Woodbury says.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Ready, Set!" is not an arts festival commission,
Woodbury says she never would have begun it "without the impetus of
the Olympics." In contrast, Daniel Ezralow's "Prelude d'Olympiad" for
the Ririe-Woodbury company is a commission from the Salt Lake
festival, but it focuses less on the Olympics than Olympus, home of
the Greek gods.</TE>
<TE>   Ezralow didn't discover dance until college and before that was
something of a jock. "I played football, I swam, I played basketball,
I played tennis, I ran track," he recalls, "and my sports background
plays a part in my dance."</TE>
<TE>   When he was a member of the Momix company, for instance, Ezralow
choreographed a pas de deux on skis and more recently worked with
champion Romanian gymnasts in "Aeros," in which three contemporary
choreographers adapted the gymnasts' movement vocabulary for a
program of unorthodox dance theater.</TE>
<TE>   That crossover between sports and dance taught him that "the
physical repetition required of athletes, and sometimes of dancers,
can bind your body. It almost creates armor. And to become truly
expressive, you have to shed that armor."</TE>
<TE>   "We all know that dance is as wide as Misha [Baryshnikov] doing a
leap to [butoh specialist] Oguri crawling across the floor," he says.
"In sport, when athletes invent new movement, some of them are
disqualified at first. As a dancer I feel I am an expressive being
much more than I would have been if I had continued as an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   No company is more identified with infusing dance with athletic
movement than Pilobolus, so it's no surprise that photos of its
dancers in picturesque contortions adorn posters and brochures for
the Olympic Arts Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Co-director Michael Tracy admits that Pilobolus initially startled
the dance world with its gymnastic people towers and other
innovations. "But we didn't see our work as sports on stage," he
says. "We were aware that we weren't drawing from traditional dance
techniques, but we were always interested in the arts, and in theater
particularly. There was a part of us that considered our work
athletic but really it was theater."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy emphasizes the role of theater when discussing the
distinctions between sports and dance. "I love to watch great
athletes," he says, "but it's the illusion and the artistic potential
of theater that moves me more than competition. Part of the
experience of a dance company going to the Olympics is the awareness
of the Olympics as theater--it has an effect a little like the
millennium celebrations. Suddenly you saw theater going on in every
city around the world at once. In a way it gives the planet a certain
self-awareness that's rare."</TE>
<TE>   "But in terms of Pilobolus and how it relates to sports, there's
something I find in dance theater--some more mysterious experience or
imagery that somehow resonates with audience members' own lives--that
interests me far more than physical prowess."</TE>
<TE>   Pilobolus' Olympic commission doesn't overtly explore sports
themes or images, Tracy says. Rather, it's part of a continuum: "In
large measure, the subject matter and the way I treated it this year
was very much an outgrowth of what I did last year."</TE>
<TE>   Like Tracy, tap phenomenon Savion Glover acknowledges that sports
images do turn up in his choreography--especially in his solos: "I'm
all over the place and I might do a step that describes a ball going
down a court, or a skater doing a jump. But meanwhile I'm tapping out
all these rhythms and I consider myself more of a musician, a
drummer, than an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Glover will be appearing in the Olympic Arts Festival with his new
eight-member group and says he's not going to change anything that he
usually does. But he will also dance during the closing ceremonies
and that Olympic performance will involve one big change that he's
none too happy about.</TE>
<TE>   Amplification problems at that event will force him to prerecord a
tap track and dance to it, Glover says. "I've never done that before,
I always improvise my solos. But now I have to choreograph a routine
and stick to it." With billions of people watching.</TE>
<TE>   Among them will be Margo Apostolos, who has been researching the
relationship between dance and sports in projects at USC and
Stanford. "After many years of this work," she says, "I deduce that
there is an athlete in every dancer and a dancer in every athlete.
I've seen in the studio that elite athletes can transfer into dance
skills very well. They can pick up the movements, at least on a basic
level, because their bodies are so well trained."</TE>
<TE>   Ezralow would agree. "There was nothing greater in Michael
Jordan's prime than watching him go down the court," he says. "It was
pure athletics and one of the most beautiful dances you could see."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also finds what he calls "an obvious relation between a
great trained dancer and a great trained athlete, both in their
dedication and in their economy of movement. It's a two-way street:
Beauty is a part of prowess. This is why people watch great dancers,
and it's the same reason people travel around the world to watch
champion Olympic athletes."</TE>

<HD>Siblings and Space Race Make 'Moon' Shine</HD>
<DH>Ingeniously staged one-man show portrays two brothers
caught up in a heavenly rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Lepage's "the far side of the moon" is part of UCLA Live's
Solo Festival, and it's true that only one actor is on the stage. Yet
Lepage's creative use of the stage is so ingenious that most other
solo theater pieces--including many in this festival--appear
predictable and earthbound.</LD>
<LD>   Lepage's concerns literally leave the Earth, as he incorporates
memories of the U.S.-Soviet space race into his text. But this
subject is framed within a very human story, set in the late '90s,
about two Canadian brothers, Philippe and Andre. They correspond
metaphorically to the Russian cosmonauts and the U.S. astronauts,
respectively.</LD>
<LD>   Neither brother is an actual space traveler. Philippe is a
middle-age academic who has never boarded an airplane. He makes ends
meet as a weekend telemarketer for a newspaper--and in one chance
telephone encounter with a former girlfriend, we learn all we need to
know about his currently nonexistent love life.</LD>
<TE>   Fascinated by the space race, Philippe has written a dissertation,
which he is defending as the play begins, arguing that the space
competition was all about narcissism.</TE>
<TE>   During the course of the play, Philippe unwittingly illustrates
his own thesis by meticulously recording a wry autobiographical video
that he plans to send to a group that will launch 10 such videos into
outer space for the benefit of any extraterrestrial beings who may
find them.</TE>
<TE>   Philippe sympathizes with the Russian cosmonauts. Even though they
blazed the path in space, they lost the race and must feel like
"losers," he believes. That's how he feels around his younger
brother, Andre.</TE>
<TE>   Andre is a successful, down-to-earth TV weather forecaster, who
works in front of a large image of the planet that he marks up with
information about the next day's temperatures and storms. He shares
his home with a gay lover.</TE>
<TE>   Andre has little patience with Philippe's philosophical
meanderings. The men are also at odds over what to do with their
just-deceased mother's belongings. Philippe is intent on preserving
her memory; Andre is more willing to let go.</TE>
<TE>   This story of sibling rivalry, which may sound conventional, is
often told in startlingly unconventional fashion. The stage becomes a
visual and aural wonderland. With the help of video and lighting
effects, large set pieces and simple household items transform into
completely different objects. Small puppets portray space travelers.
Laurie Anderson's recorded score emphasizes the sense of mystery and
magic.</TE>
<TE>   The more conventional parts of the script, such as several
telephone monologues, are replete with droll humor and often with
understated poignancy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the outline of puppeteer Pierre Bernier can sometimes be
spotted, only one actor portrays both brothers as well as their
mother and Philippe's doctor. In late 2000, Lepage was that actor in
performances at Irvine Barclay Theatre. At UCLA, Yves Jacques has
taken over the roles.</TE>
<TE>   The casting makes little difference. Jacques has obviously learned
well from the master and is just as compelling throughout this long
(nearly 150 minutes with no intermission) but mesmerizing production.</TE>
<TE>   It was a thrill to see the wizard behind "the far side of the
moon" in Irvine. But anyone who enjoys visionary theater should see
this production regardless of whether Lepage himself is in it.</TE>

<HD>Series Spotlights an Innovative Animation Pioneer</HD>
<DH>Movies: Mary Ellen Bute blended music, abstract imagery and
movement into her early short films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Writing With Lighting: D.W. Griffith, Mary Ellen Bute, Busby
Berkeley," a program in the "Unseen Cinema: Early American
Avant-Garde Film" series that the UCLA Film and Television Archive is
presenting Sunday, offers viewers a rare look at the work of one of
the first American abstract animators and one of the first women to
enter a field dominated by male artists. Bute's name may not be
widely known today, but during the mid-1930s, her experimental short
films screened at the prestigious Radio City Music Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Texas in 1904, Bute received a scholarship to the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. She initially intended to paint in
the manner of Rosa Bonheur, but later recalled that in Philadelphia,
"I was deeply impressed by the wonderful Picassos, the African art,
the Paul Klees, the Braques, the Kandinskys. Kandinsky used abstract,
nonobjective canvas the way you experience a musical composition.
Well, I thought it was terrific but these things should be unwound in
[a] time continuity. It was a dance. That became my objective."</LD>
<TE>   Her desire to blend music, abstract imagery and movement led her
to New York, where she studied with electronics wizard Leon Theremin;
Thomas Wilfred, who developed a color organ; and
musician-mathematician Joseph Schillinger. She collaborated with
experimental filmmaker Melville Webber and Ted Nemeth, a cameraman
with experience in advertising, documentaries and special effects.
Bute married Nemeth in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   The early films from the late '30s and early '40s in "Writing With
Lighting" feature a variety of techniques, including 3-D miniatures,
cels, cutouts and drawings on film. Bute's abstract and semiabstract
images reflect the influence of the nonobjective animator Oskar
Fischinger (who fled Germany for Hollywood in 1935). Her work would
influence a later generation of Los Angeles-based experimental
filmmakers, notably computer animation pioneer John Whitney Sr.</TE>
<TE>   In "Synchromy No. 4: Escape," set to the Toccata section of Bach's
"Toccata and Fugue in D minor," Bute juxtaposes moving grids with a
series of patterns built out of golden triangles. The patterns
suggest structures, tunnels and even organic shapes as they form and
re-form in time to the music. In "Parabola," she uses wire sculptures
and three-dimensional models to examine the relationship between the
curve and the cone from which is it generated.</TE>
<TE>   Bute made "Escape" and "Parabola" in 1937, the year Walt Disney
completed "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and a loony waterfowl who
would become Daffy Duck "woo-hoo'ed" his way through Tex Avery's
"Porky's Duck Hunt" at Warner Bros. Bute doesn't present a story or
provoke laughs in her shorts; she offers a vision of animation
completely unlike the Hollywood cartoons that define the medium for
most Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to three other Bute shorts"Writing With Lighting"
includes two Busby Berkeley musical numbers: "Don't Say Goodnight"
from "Wonder Bar" (1934) and "By a Waterfall" from "Footlight Parade"
(1933).</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley's work epitomizes Hollywood movie-making at its most
lavish; Bute's offers a minimalist alternative to mainstream films.
But there are some surprising parallels between Bute's visuals and
the geometric patterns formed by lines of dancers in Berkeley's
production numbers. Bute continued to make animated and live-action
films until her death in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Writing With Lighting" screens Sunday at 2 p.m. at the James
Bridges Theater in Melnitz Hall at UCLA. Admission: $7, general; $5,
students, seniors. Information: (310) 206-8013 or

<HD>In 'mercy,' Looking for Truths in Human Nature</HD>
<DH>Meredith Monk and Ann Hamilton join forces to create a
moving forum for big-picture questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two and half years ago, in a Westside synagogue, Meredith Monk sang
to the Dalai Lama, who was on hand to give a talk. She stood before
him and welcomed him with an invocation, making distinct music in her
wordless, elemental manner that seems to come directly out of her
body and being. She beamed. He beamed. Before long, the large temple
seemed aglow.</LD>
<LD>   A few months later, Monk returned to the Southland to present her
sci-fi opera, "Magic Frequencies." It began with Monk and a member of
her company seated across a kitchen table, singing a loopy duet. She
beamed. He beamed.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, it wasn't long before the joint was spiritually
jumping, this time attracting the attention of adorable aliens from
outer space.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday night at UCLA's Royce Hall, Monk once again began a new
piece sitting at a table across from a partner, singing, beaming. Her
companion was the noted installation artist, Ann Hamilton, who beamed
a light into Monk's mouth as she intoned a drone. A miniature camera,
attached to Monk's teeth, then beamed the inside view of chanting
lips onto the large screen that served as the backdrop of the stage.
No holy men, no aliens beckoned. Instead, the beaming in "mercy," the
new collaborative work from Monk and Hamilton, called forth essential
questions of our own spirituality, and about what is true and what is
alien in human nature.</TE>
<TE>   The 83-minute performance piece, which had its premiere last
summer in Durham, S.C., comes without explanation. In interviews, the
two artists have described the inspiration for "mercy" as an attempt
to come to terms with the incomprehension they felt when they watched
on TV the shooting of a Palestinian boy, caught in cross-fire on the
Gaza Strip, neither side acknowledging his father's pleas for mercy.
It is a horrific image, but one we don't see or need to know about.
There was no reference to it in the work, and the program came
without notes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, what this intensely moving, drop-dead gorgeous,
can't-be-categorized fluid piece of meditative music, movement and
milieu presents is an immersion into the process of transcendence.
And what is truly remarkable is that it does this in many unrelated
ways that all somehow interlock.</TE>
<TE>   One example of many occurs near the beginning. Hamilton, still at
the table, trains her minute camera on her fingertip, as she draws a
line with a pencil, across an unfurling bolt of paper. The entire
backdrop of the stage, then, is magnified pencil lead and flowing
line, a beautiful image of rippling movement,  a road endlessly
expanding.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Monk moves away from the table, her chair slowly
gliding backward, her music following repetitious cycles that slowly
evolve in their own directions. The counterpoint of different kinds
of movement is hypnotic.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone would have predicted a success from the collaboration
of Monk and Hamilton. However compatible their sensibilities may be,
they are both incredibly strong artists who create complete worlds.
Monk--a composer, choreographer, singer, dancer, myth maker and what
not--is the model of a poly-artist with an all-encompassing vision.
Hamilton's immense, overwhelming installations are vast landscapes,
such as the facade she created for the new main library in San
Francisco with 50,000 3-inch-by-5-inch annotated cards.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond their inevitable ornate grandiosity, Monk and Hamilton
often work on a downright primordial level. And together, they avoid
competition by keeping everything simple and pure.  In "mercy," Monk
creates her typically direct images of human contact and feeling with
her eight-member company of singers, musicians and dancers.</TE>
<TE>   In one scene a doctor (Theo Bleckmann) slowly approaches Monk, his
voice jumping between baritone and falsetto. He examines her. They
sing nonsense syllables, but unmistakably deep feelings, the kind for
which words can seem inadequate, are expressed.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, such feelings emerge. There is the shock of the
doors of the theater opening, bright lights shining and a chorus of
over-coated refugees walking past us, inserting the audience into
some kind of exodus.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton's additions to Monk's evocations are equally arresting,
her miniature camera creating landscapes of the human face, the
written word.</TE>
<TE>   She bathes the stage in glorious color. As Lanny Harrison dances,
a scrim is lowered , turning the luminous screen behind her into
living moire patterns. There is sheer magic in the scene in which
Hamilton makes Monk's syllabic song visible by causing the breath of
two singers to release bubbles from watery curtains.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end, Hamilton's camera focuses on a page of text. Words
appear out of context, but one sentence survives. Ogres, it says, are
also people, but inhuman. Then a simple, radiant wordless song from
five singers in a circle; behind them a mouth large and spooky
illuminated on the screen. I can't tell you why, but at that moment,
after much grave, earnest, disquieting beauty, the quality of "mercy"
seemed the essence of humanity.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lifetime cable channel, which describes its media mission as
"Television for Women," shows the extent of that commitment this
month by spearheading a multifaceted national campaign against
domestic violence and sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   The effort includes cable and online programming, community
outreach and a political component through the Congressional Women's
Caucus, and it opens impressively Sunday with a slate of programming
anchored by a brutally frank episode of "Strong Medicine" (8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   The hospital drama, starring Janine Turner ("Northern Exposure")
as Dr. Dana Stowe, spares little time getting to the issue at hand.</LD>
<TE>   After a brief scene in which the promotion of a new chief of
surgery (guest star Gregory Harrison as Dr. Rand Kilner) is feted at
a champagne celebration among staff, Dr. Lu Delgado (Rosa Blasi)
leaves the festivities early, only to appear at the emergency room
later that night with some shocking information: She says that she
has been raped--by Kilner.</TE>
<TE>   As word spreads within the facility, Delgado is subjected to the

<HD>A Woman of Brass Pursues the Lyricism of a Human Voice</HD>
<DH>Music: Ingrid Jensen, who performs at the Newport Beach
Jazz Party, has moved past just following the guys.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may be the 21st century, but many jazz fans still have a
distinctly outdated reaction when they see a woman playing a trumpet
in a jazz group.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend, they will have the opportunity to test those
reactions at the Newport Beach Jazz Party, when New York-based
trumpeter/flugelhornist Ingrid Jensen will appear. .</LD>
<LD>   True, the jazz world isn't nearly as sexist as it was, say, in the
swing years, when the emphasis in all-woman groups such as the Ina
Rae Hutton Band focused more on gowns and hairstyles than musical
originality. (Hutton, you may recall, was billed as "The Blonde
Bombshell of Rhythm.") But vestiges of the brass ceiling still
remain, and female artists who, like Jensen, insist upon being judged
solely as musicians have to prove themselves at every level of their
careers.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was coming up," said Jensen, 34, "there was a lot of
pioneering that needed to be done, insofar as people's openness. It
wasn't as hard as it used to be in the days when, if a female went to
a jam session, she'd have to wait until four in the morning before
they'd let her sit in and play a tune. But there's still a lot more
that needs to be done before we get to the point where people look at
you when you stand up to play and just say, `OK, let's see what
you've got'."</TE>
<TE>   Given Jensen's imaginative qualities, it's hard to imagine anyone
reacting in anything other than a positive fashion to her playing. At
a time when technical virtuosity rules and it can be difficult to
distinguish one young trumpeter from another, she possesses an
authentically original sound.</TE>
<TE>   Legendary trumpeter Art Farmer referred to her "feeling, swing,
drive, taste, grace and lyricism." And Clark Terry said he is "proud
to describe her as a protege of mine."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen, in turn, calls Terry "the reason I'm playing jazz today."
But her fundamental talent springs from a rich musical heritage. Her
mother, Karen, is a pianist who continues to work as a professional
musician, and her younger sister, Christine, is a saxophonist.</TE>
<TE>   "My Mom," Jensen said, "really set us up with Oscar Peterson and
Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong and the Basie Band--all that
stuff--while we were growing up in Vancouver. I didn't want to play
trumpet at first, because I kind of preferred the sound of Jack
Teagarden to Louis. But eventually I figured out that they're all
great."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen left Vancouver to study at the Berklee College of Music in
Boston, eventually winding up in Europe, where she became the
youngest faculty member at Austria's Bruckner Conservatory. New York
City beckoned, however, as it eventually does for many jazz artists,
and she has been living in the Big Apple since the mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Like many female instrumentalists, she started out feeling she had
to play as fast, as hard and as high as male trumpeters.</TE>
<TE>   "I had that quality for a while," she said, "but that was because
I wanted to play and I wanted to get work. And I just felt that the
only way I could do that was by being forceful in my playing."</TE>
<TE>   But she feels that her tenure in Europe helped trigger the
realization that she could "just be an artist, just back off, and
just play music."</TE>
<TE>   Those attending the Jazz Party, which started Friday, may detect
another quality in Jensen's style--the kind of soaring lyricism one
associates with jazz singers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really influenced by singers--female singers, especially,
of all styles," she said. "Like Joni Mitchell. That was something
that made me realize that the trumpet is just another vehicle for
your voice rather than a piece of brass and valves. And it helped me
to hear things from my own vocal perspective, because, for me, that's
what playing a brass instrument really is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very vocal, almost parallel to being a singer. And I hope
that's what comes through to my listeners."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen appears with small groups throughout the weekend, including
tonight's Nightcap Session in the Newport Room. She will also be
featured with Ann Patterson's Maiden Voyage Big Band this afternoon
on the Main Pool Stage and in a duo female trumpeter session with
Stacey Rowles on Sunday evening in the Pacific Ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen and Rowles will not be the only female instrumentalists at
the party. Also scheduled to perform are the usually all-female
Maiden Voyage, fronted by Patterson, a versatile woodwind and
saxophone artist; flutist Holly Hofmann; and pianist-singer Ann
Hampton Callaway. "The important thing to me," Jensen said, "is to be
in a setting, in a community that is really all about the music--not
how many males or how many females are on stage. The bottom line here
is that this is going to be fun. And that's what a jazz party is all
about, to get together with a bunch of different players, in a bunch
of different settings and make something spontaneous happen."</TE>

<HD>Ballet Classique Takes Stage in Dance Visions</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight dance students from the Conservatoire de Paris are at UC Irvine
for a two-week residency that will culminate in their participation
in the UCI Dance Visions concerts Thursday through Feb. 23 at the
Irvine Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The eight are members of the Junior Ballet Classique, a training
and touring troupe for which UCI dance professor--and former National
Ballet of Canada principal dancer--David Allan created "Palladio"
last spring. They will dance "Palladio" to music by Karl Jenkins on
the UCI dance program, as well as on a Feb. 24 program that presents
other repertory the troupe has recently toured.</LD>
<LD>   "The residency is part of an exchange program I discussed with the
company when I was creating 'Palladio' in Paris," Allan said.</LD>
<TE>   "They asked, 'Do you really have dancers?' I said, 'We have a
strong ballet program here at UCI,' and I was able to show that when
I took six dancers to Paris in November to study. They studied with
all these different dancers, choreographers and theater
improvisational people. It ended up being quite a fantastic week."</TE>
<TE>   The trip was sponsored by William J. Gillespie, an Orange County
philanthropist and supporter of the UCI dance department. During
their residency, the French students will take dance classes and
rehearse with Allan or UCI faculty member Muriel Belmondo and take
workshops in the Motion Capture Technology Studio directed by Lisa
Naugle.</TE>
<TE>   UCI has been invited to participate in the annual Festival of
Dance at the Conservatoire de Paris in May 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "They usually invite groups from prestigious academies," Allan
said. "We'll be the first American group ever presented there, which
is pretty exciting for a university."</TE>
<TE>   * UCI Dance Visions program will be danced Thursday and Friday at
8 p.m. and Feb. 23 at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Irvine Barclay Theatre,
4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. The Junior Ballet Classique will also
dance a largely different program Feb. 24 at 3 p.m. at the Irvine
theater. Tickets for Thursday, Saturday, Sunday afternoon: $15.
Tickets for Friday and Saturday evenings: $18. (949) 854-4646.</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Concerto Contest Winners Perform</TE>
<TE>   Winners of the 2001 Saddleback College Concerto Competition will
appear with the Saddleback Symphony on Feb. 23 at 8 p.m. at McKinney
Theatre on the Mission Viejo campus. The soloists include pianists
Lisa Iwaki, Michael Zhang, Brian Kim and Audrey Pahmer. Carmen Cortez
Dominguez will conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback College is at 28000 Marguerite Parkway. Admission: $8.
(949) 582-4656.</TE>
<TE>   E-Competition to Link Pianos in U.S. and Japan</TE>
<TE>   Yamaha will sponsor the first "International Piano-e-Competition"
on the Internet in June. Finalists will compete in Minneapolis on a
piano linked by technology to a  Disklavier piano in Japan, where two
of the judges will be. Top prize is $25,000, a recital at Alice Tully
Hall in New York, a CD release on the Ten Thousand Lakes label and a
Yamaha DC3 A Disklavier grand piano. Judges include Emmanuel Ax and
Yefim Bronfman, judging from Japan, and seven judges in Minneapolis,
including Abbey Simon. Applications must be postmarked by March 1.
They are available online at www.piano-e-competition.com.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a slowdown in air travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, aviation experts still predict that perhaps 80 million more
people a year will be flying into and out of the Los Angeles region
within two decades. Something has to give.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles International Airport, with its expansion plans mired
in controversy, could handle only about one-quarter of that
additional load. It is already bearing most of the weight for
Southern California and suffers one of the highest rates of near
collisions on runways and one of the worst records for late arrivals.
Ontario Airport wants new business and easily could expand to serve a
quickly growing population around it, but meeting clean air standards
poses a tough problem in the Inland Empire.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California can't afford to foreclose its limited options
at other airports in the region. One of them should remain El Toro,
the former military base in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   On the March 5 ballot in Orange County is a proposal that, in
effect, would shut the option of building an airport, any airport, at
El Toro, instead allocating its 4,700 acres to parks, schools, health
care facilities, museums, other cultural uses, open space and sports
facilities. Given the alternative of an outsized and poorly planned
airport, the park is undeniably attractive. The Times regularly has
supported park bond issues on state and local ballots. But we oppose
Measure W, although we do so with an understanding of the blunders
and missteps that got the county to this point.</TE>
<TE>   Without preserving some kind of airfield potential for El Toro,
Orange County would be left to meet its own and its regional
obligations under the narrow growth capacity of John Wayne Airport.
It's a facility with a quirky takeoff pattern, a runway problem
similar to LAX's and one 5,700-foot runway to serve a county coming
up on 3 million people. Although its current court-approved caps on
flights and hours of operation expire in 2005, the airport is really
not equipped to carry Orange County's future need alone.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing Measure W does not mean that we embrace a plan for an
airport that could end up larger than Boston's Logan Airport. Our
disappointment in the various designs put forth over the past eight
years remains. It is astonishing that county planners never decided
to rip up and replace an antiquated runway design, and that they did
not draw up flight paths better suited to prevailing winds and the
concerns of longtime residents. Pilots say the proposed flight
patterns make them nervous about clearing the nearby mountains. And
the proposed airport is still too big.</TE>
<TE>   If the airport choice survives next month's initiative, opponents
absolutely should explore every legal alternative to block the
current plan in the hopes of a better design.</TE>
<TE>   A routine decision about recycling a closed military base has
turned into a nightmarish struggle. A county that grafted affluent
new suburbs and gleaming high-tech parks onto a feudal political
structure has been torn apart over this plan since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In decades past, before the multitudes of suburbanites arrived
seeking clean air and good schools, regional decisions in Orange
County were dictated mostly by a moneyed elite with ready access to
compliant county supervisors. When that lingering system, along with
agitation from Newport Beach to divert the county's air traffic away
from John Wayne, produced a preposterous early plan to install a
38-million-passenger-a-year international airport at El Toro, it
collided with the rising political force of the suburbs. But because
supervisorial districts are geographical, a thin majority of three
managed to stay beyond the reach of angry voters from Irvine south to
San Clemente and from Laguna Beach east into the new communities of
Foothill Ranch and Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Through ineptitude and arrogance, this majority last year signed
off on an environmental impact report that left a host of questions
that the Federal Aviation Administration, the nation's pilots and the
airlines are still trying to sort out.</TE>
<TE>   We wish this initiative were offering a choice between a good
airport plan and the one that now exists. But we must oppose Measure
W because it would zone away a more modest and better designed
aviation option for El Toro, at some point in the future, just
because politicians bungled the original plan. Orange County does not
need Measure W. It does need better leadership.</TE>

<HD>Mammograms and Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For any woman who's had breast cancer--and for every woman who fears
it--listening to the current debate over the scientific value of
mammography must seem like watching an atheist try to convince a true
believer that God doesn't exist. It's engaging but irrelevant.</LD>
<LD>   A National Cancer Institute study released last month underscores
the earlier findings of Danish scientists that regular mammograms may
not be the lifesaver long believed. For women with aggressive and
fast-growing tumors, even catching the cancer early may not change
the outcome. And women whose tumors are slow-growing may do fine even
if the cancer isn't detected until it's large enough to feel.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps mammography is most helpful, these researchers conclude,
for women whose tumors are somewhere between, neither particularly
aggressive nor slow-growing. These tumors represent just 15% to 20%
of all breast cancers. The researchers argue that routine screenings
don't make sense for most women.</LD>
<TE>   Other scientists dispute these conclusions, claiming that the
studies are methodologically flawed. They say mammograms save more
lives than skeptics grasp, and they urge women to continue to be
screened. Is it any wonder that most women will align themselves with
this camp? Is there any rational reason not to?</TE>
<TE>   Yes. Cost. Mammograms average $100, although many clinics charge
much less. Overall, the national tab for breast cancer screening runs
into many millions each year. If managed care agencies cut out most
annual exams, the potential cost savings for insurers--and the
individuals and corporations who pay their premiums--would be
significant. In other words, if mammography's critics are right, a
decision grounded in a cost-benefit analysis based on statistics may
make economic sense.</TE>
<TE>   But ask an individual woman if $100 is too high an annual price to
put on the measure of peace of mind such tests can bring. The managed
care industry might ask that too, in weighing whether to dump
testing. The issue, after all, is survival.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 years after President Nixon declared a "war on
cancer," the disease still bedevils physicians and terrifies its
victims. An estimated 205,000 women will be found to have breast
cancer this year and 40,000 will die of the disease. After all the
celebrity run/walks, the lobbying and the billions spent on research,
there's still no cure in sight. The death rate has dropped slightly
over the last decade, but for too many the discovery of a tumor is
still the beginning of a long and ghastly end. In the absence of a
"magic" cure, women have come to believe that mammograms are a key to
their survival.</TE>
<TE>   Women don't need the National Cancer Institute to convince them
that mammograms are far from foolproof. At the same time, no one
doubts that they do work. Sometimes. With cancer, there is never a
certain death, never a sure cure. And until that cure is discovered,
a woman is left with a faith that flows in part from the
knowledge--or is it now chimera?--that there is something she can do
to reduce the odds that a lump that can't be felt will quickly cause
havoc throughout her body. Medical exams are never pleasant, and no
woman looks forward to having her breasts squeezed between those cold
glass plates. But it certainly beats simply crossing her fingers.</TE>

<LD>Re "Turn Away From Selfish Behavior: Use Your Signal," Voices, Feb.
9: I share professor John Allswang's irritation over self-centered
drivers who don't care enough about others to use their turn signals.
Making matters worse, the antisocials are abetted by the clueless.
Many left-turners waiting at a red light start to signal only after
the light changes. The rest of us have been conditioned to expect
this behavior and change to the right lane, blocking those who had
hoped to turn right on the red light. Maybe the frustrated
right-turners take it out on somebody else. And on it goes.</LD>
<LD>   Jan C. Gabrielson</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indeed there are increasing numbers of drivers who neglect to use
their turn signals. But I believe that the professor missed the main
reason that this is so. In order to activate the turn signal, one
must use the left hand. That hand is being used by more and more
drivers who are talking on their cell phones, another expression of
the self-centeredness of people these days. Everything that they have
to say is important at all hours of the day, even when doing
something that requires their full attention, like steering that
other measure of modern selfishness--the SUV (or as a friend of mine
likes to call them, road bullies).</TE>

<TE>   Bravo for Allswang's piece on the endless slew of selfish drivers
who refuse to use their turn signals. Why wouldn't you want to be
helpful to your fellow motorists and let them know what you're doing?
I not only drive in Santa Barbara but also ride my bicycle as well
and, believe me, that is just as discouraging. I make it a point to
use hand signals at every junction. Even when no one is around, I try
to stay in the habit, so I don't even have to decide if I should
signal or not. And, ultimately, that may well be a driver's main
dilemma: contemplating a turn signal at all.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I must admit that on occasion I stop signaling. However, it is
always in response to selfish drivers who will not allow you to
change lanes, especially on the freeway when you must get on or off.
After continuously attempting to merge left or right and seeing
drivers speed up to prevent my move, I turn my signal off and wait
for an opening to activate my signal at the last moment and move
fast. Don't these selfish drivers ever need to change lanes?</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Lamont</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Allswang that people have a disregard for others on
the road when they fail to use turn signals. Even worse is that peace
officers, especially LAPD and CHP, seldom, if ever, use them. Of
course they sometimes have a legitimate law enforcement reason, but
usually it's their "I don't have to, so I'm not going to" attitude
that lowers the bar, which I hope most citizens know better than to
follow. Unfortunately, L.A.'s finest aren't when it comes to driving.</TE>

<TE>   I would disagree with Allswang's statement that "by a conservative
estimate, 20% to 25% of California drivers have stopped using their
turn signals." I would say that only 20% to 25% of drivers do use
turn signals. However, he is right on when he says that this is a
matter not only of safety but even more so of courtesy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ripe for Cutting: Prison Budgets," Opinion, Feb. 10: Glad to see
someone saying the unspeakable. The authors could have also mentioned
that Gov. Gray Davis refuses to approve his own parole board's
recommendations for release of a few qualified, very long-serving
"term to lifers"--I mean the perhaps 350 out of the almost 20,000
prisoners who have sentences, with the possibility of parole, of
seven to life, 15 to life, 25 to life.</LD>
<LD>   Believe me, if the parole board, which is almost exclusively made
up of former law enforcement people, recommends someone for parole,
it means that that individual has jumped through a lot of hoops,
including public safety. But Davis is held back from allowing the
parole process to function normally by his political timidity and by
his deep financial obligation to prison interests.</LD>
<LD>   Let's see, 350 prisoners times the $25,607 it costs annually for
incarceration comes to $8,962,450 that could be cut from the prison
budget and added to education or health care. Ripe indeed.</LD>
<TE>   Deborah D. Jimenez</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with the heart of your article. Prison costs must be
reduced. But your solution is plain wrong. Ronald Reagan reduced the
state budget by closing minimum security facilities and initiating a
probation subsidy program to provide "punishment" for nonviolent
offenders in the community. This led to a huge rise in crime in the
state and ultimately led police chiefs like Ed Davis to lead a call
for greater incarceration of all felons. The "determinate" sentencing
policy of 1977 was the result of this call.</TE>
<TE>   Now The Times and many others call for reduction of "three
strikes" and the use of prisons in an effort to cut costs. But this
will not cut costs. The costs will merely be transferred to insurance
premiums as crimes increase, as the vast majority of prisoners do not
want to get out of prison. One-third don't want to get out at all.
One-third like an occasional vacation, but go on parole with every
intention of returning as soon as possible, preferably to the same
prison. Then you have a third who really want to get out and stay
out. But they soon find out that the outside is a pretty inhospitable
place for ex-cons who have $200 in their pockets to hold them until
their first paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   Crime's down. Keep locking people up who need it. But make the
lockup less costly. And, if you don't want them to feel the need to
return to prison, add the cost of education.</TE>
<TE>   I earned a college degree through the SOL-AP program at Soledad
Prison from San Jose State. I've been out for 13 years. That's a year
longer than I was inside. And not even a traffic ticket in those 13
years.</TE>
<TE>   W.K. Murphy</TE>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suggestions made for cutting prisons by the Justice Policy
Institute make a lot of sense. Every necessary dollar spent on
prisons means less money for education in our current budget deficit
crisis. Why not also release older, deserving prisoners, say 50 or
older, who are eligible for parole and who studies show are extremely
unlikely to offer any threat to society? These older prisoners also
require greater medical attention at a considerable cost to
taxpayers.</TE>

<LD>"Town Wants More Than Citrus Trees" (Feb. 10), about Orange Cove,
left the impression that the orange-growing business in that town
began in the 1960s when growers were forced out of the L.A. area. My
father and his family moved from North Whittier Heights to Orange
Cove in about 1914 by wagon over the Old Ridge Route. When they
arrived, my grandfather helped clear land for the groves.</LD>
<LD>   The classic "California Place Names" by Erwin Gudde reports that
Orange Cove was named in 1913 by the owners of the Orosi Lands Co.
While there may have been an influx of orange growers in the 1960s,
they came to a place long known for its orange groves.</LD>

Bay. Who better to defend these Arab terrorists for shooting at our
troops in Afghanistan than an attorney who has made his living
defending urban terrorists (i.e., gangbangers and armed bank robbers)
who shot at police? It seems like a natural progression.</LD>

<LD>Re "Reports of Priests' Abuse Enrage Boston Catholics," Feb. 9: That
there are deviants galore in the Boston Archdiocese is no surprise to
me. Thirty years ago, I taught psychology to high school seniors in
two predominantly Catholic communities in the Boston area. For 10
years, I was a magnet for troubled kids--usually boys--struggling
with issues of sexuality.</LD>
<LD>   I was able to play a small part in helping the majority make the
awkward transition from painful adolescence to acceptance and a
healthy, productive adulthood. The kids I couldn't help were the most
seriously disturbed, with issues beyond mere sexual preference. Year
after year, I watched in dismay as those kids chose the priesthood.
As long as the Catholic Church insists on celibacy, the priesthood
will continue to be a magnet for the sexually maladjusted, both gay
and straight.</LD>

<HD>No Single Person Broke the Hollywood Blacklist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was deeply disturbed by Jack Valenti's Feb. 9 letter concerning the
Hollywood blacklist. Valenti states that "the blacklist was
irretrievably broken by an actor-producer named Kirk Douglas" when my
husband Dalton Trumbo's name appeared on the film "Spartacus."
Valenti proclaims, "Douglas broke the blacklist, forever." In January
1960, Otto Preminger announced that Trumbo would receive screenplay
credit for the film "Exodus." It wasn't until August 1960 that
Douglas announced my husband's name also would appear on the credits
of "Spartacus."</LD>
<TE>   While it took men of principle and courage like Preminger and
Douglas to at long last defy the Hollywood studios, it is my
unwavering conviction that it was primarily the efforts of
blacklisted writers themselves that caused the blacklist to be
broken. For more than 12 years these men and women continued to write
without credit at a fraction of what they had earned before. It was
the quality of their work that attracted producers--scripts like
"Roman Holiday," "Bridge Over the River Kwai" and "The Defiant Ones,"
which all received pseudonymous Oscars for writing. For more than a
decade they brought lawsuits, gave speeches, wrote articles,
published pamphlets and pleaded their cause on television and radio.
By the time Trumbo's name appeared on "Spartacus" and "Exodus" the
ground had been well prepared by the ceaseless efforts of blacklisted
writers.</TE>
<TE>   It goes without saying that no single person can be credited with
"breaking" the blacklist.</TE>
<TE>   My husband's affection and respect for Douglas was great, and
there is a body of correspondence that attests to this. However,
Valenti's assertion that one of these letters was tear-stained with
gratitude is simply untrue, and misrepresents both my husband's
character and conduct.</TE>

<TE>   Michael Cregan (letter, Feb. 10) asked what the Hollywood
blacklist controversy would look like if we changed "Communist Party"
to "Nazi Party." Well, what if we did? It would still be a legal
entity in the U.S., entitled to stage its offensive marches through
Jewish neighborhoods. That is what the U.S. is about. We don't have
to agree with everyone's harebrained ideas, but we absolutely cannot
stop them from expressing those ideas. Outlawing political beliefs
with which one doesn't agree was fine in Nazi Germany and Communist
Russia, but not here.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The mental health community has long bemoaned the demeaning
caricatures of people with mental illnesses. Hollywood has
contributed to the problem. That is why it is important to celebrate
Ron Howard's brilliant film, "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   The picture, based on the story of John Nash, who despite his
schizophrenia went on to win a Nobel Prize, powerfully conveys the
message that recovery is possible and that "extraordinary things can
happen."</LD>
<LD>   The myth that mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia are hopeless, progressively deteriorating diseases is
pervasive in our culture.</LD>
<TE>   While several studies have thoroughly debunked these harmful
stereotypes, the insidious stigma persists. As a result, people
suffering from these treatable conditions often avoid seeking help.</TE>
<TE>   When they do have the courage to seek services, they are
frequently labeled and discriminated against by employers, landlords,
friends and even family.</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury, they are consigned to marginal lives of
low expectations, unemployment, poverty and isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind" compellingly illustrates some of the principles
of recovery from mental illness. The main character's wife withstands
tremendous anguish and trauma to stand by her husband's side and
instills both the hope and belief that he can transcend his illness.</TE>
<TE>   People with mental illness desperately need hope and someone who
believes in them.</TE>
<TE>   The Nash character summons all his strength to rejoin his former
community (the Princeton campus) to attempt to reconnect with

<TE>   People diagnosed with mental illness must face this harrowing
journey as well to reclaim lost roles and lost relationships.</TE>
<TE>   The Nash character learns through repeated painful experiences
that some of his symptoms may never subside and that he must cope by
"choosing to ignore" his persistent delusions and hallucinations.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, many people with a psychiatric disability have come to
realize that they can't wait for the cure before working on their
life goals; they recognize that working on their dreams while coping
with symptoms is part of their rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   The mental health community will take a special interest in the
Academy Awards on March 24. Just a few golden statues will seem like
further affirmation that the time has come for people with
psychiatric disabilities to step out from the darkness.</TE>

future Nobel Prize winners or have movies made about their lives,
countless numbers will heroically beat the odds to lead lives of

<LD>A recent federal order will mainstream 35,000 disabled children from
special-needs classes into regular classes in the Los Angeles Unified
School District.</LD>
<LD>   Studies have shown that most physically and psychologically
disabled students make faster progress when they share at least some
classes with nondisabled peers. But critics charge that sometimes
these students are disruptive in class and demand a greater
percentage of the teacher's time and attention.</LD>

will mean in her classrooms.</LD>

<TE>   I never would want to see a student who wished to be with the
mainstream exiled [to special education classes]. Mainstream students
need to learn how to react with people who have disabilities;
however, we shouldn't teach values and character issues at the
expense of the disabled students' self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   Also, I am not evaluated on the improvement of my students'
character but rather on their reading and writing scores.</TE>
<TE>   Many students act very appropriately to disabled students, holding
doors or helping in other ways. However, many students are verbally
cruel or physically take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The list of things to make this work must be long, from ramps to
adult teacher aides in each classroom.</TE>
<TE>   I think that sometimes the learning-challenged students are the
least mature and the "biggest bullies" in the classroom. Teachers
can't be watching them every minute of the day.</TE>
<TE>   I don't think that this affects the truly motivated and
high-achieving students. But every teacher only has a finite number
of minutes in class. Should that time be spent on behavior problems
or teaching subject matter? The easily distracted and undermotivated
children will get even less attention while I deal with children who
have attention deficit disorders.</TE>
<TE>   I am rated by how much I increase my students' scores on
standardized tests. In order to achieve higher scores, I need to be
able to spend more time teaching--not have my time splintered further
than it already is by students who aren't behaving in class.</TE>
<TE>   I am often asked how private schools do such a good job on a
smaller per-student budget. One of the many reasons is they do not
have to take students they cannot accommodate. Public schools will
have to do a lot to accommodate all the different disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the older schools have two-story buildings. It would be
very expensive to build elevators and staff them with personnel to
ensure that only those who need them use them. What would happen in
an earthquake or fire when elevators couldn't be used?</TE>
<TE>   At Poly, each teacher changes classrooms during the day and
vacates while off-track (on vacation).</TE>
<TE>   It is a very complex schedule. I might be in a bungalow with two
steps when a student in a wheelchair is assigned to my class.
Someone's schedule must change. I am the only A track health teacher,
so the student would have to wait until I was assigned to a room with
a ramp or the whole class would have to change rooms.</TE>
<TE>   In all I do not think it can be done easily or cheaply.</TE>

<LD>Re "Republican Party's Future Needs to Center on Moving Away From Far
Right," by George Skelton, Feb. 11: Last weekend, Bill Simon stated
that the upcoming Republican gubernatorial primary "is about the
heart and soul of the Republican Party." I agree with him, but not
with his reasoning. What use are rhetoric and ideology when they
cannot be implemented through the election of public officials?</LD>
<LD>   As a recent college Republican chairman at USC and current student
at Yale Law School, I can assure you that the true heart and soul of
any political party is to win elections. Neither Simon nor Bill Jones
stands a chance against Gov. Gray Davis this fall. Dick Riordan,
however, has Davis' pens shaking in his pocket protector. While
Riordan may not completely toe the party line, his pragmatic approach
to politics is just what the Republican Party needs to regain control
of Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   The ideological blinders of last weekend's convention attendees
(not to mention the former party chairmen who shortsightedly say they
will not vote for Riordan) risk dooming the rest of California's
Republicans to a fate we would rather not endure: four more years of
Gray. I'd like to return to California after I graduate law school,
so please, be smart and vote for Riordan this March.</LD>

<TE>   I am a 23-year-old PhD student at UC Berkeley and recently
attended the California Republican Convention in San Jose. I am part
of a group of progressive young Republicans at Berkeley who want the
party to be more inclusive. The reception we got at the convention,
however, was tepid at best. As a young Republican, I feel very
disenchanted with the party's response to and interest in the voice
of my peers and myself. The only capacity it seems interested in, in
us, is as envelope-stuffing automatons.</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders should be reaching out to the future leaders who
will fill their roles in the next few decades. This is anything but
the case, however. As a conservative in Berkeley, I feel the party
has written me off, even though I have observed a definite untapped
conservative current among students here who are looking for
leadership from the party. It is very unfortunate that the Republican
leadership seems to have forgotten the conservative youth here at UC
Berkeley who want to be heard and respected by the party they
support. Come election day, do not be surprised if we forget the
Republican Party.</TE>

<LD>In "Embattled Arafat Vows to Continue His Struggle" (Feb. 10),
Marjorie Miller shows her total lack of sensitivity to the victims of
Yasser Arafat's terror regime when she compares Arafat to a "Jewish
mother."</LD>
<LD>   It is unbelievable that Miller would write such a thing and that
The Times would find it fit to print.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat sends his terrorists into Israel seeking to murder Jewish
mothers and the children and husbands of Jewish mothers. The Times
should send Miller to seek out these devastated families and
apologize to them for her glib words that kill again.</LD>

<TE>   In his Feb. 8 commentary, "The Missing Link to Mideast Peace: Arab
Pressure," David Makovsky's statement that the region's leaders fear
their own people is certainly true, because for years the region's
leaders have been instilling hatred of Israel and the Jewish people
in their schools and newspapers. This attitude would have to be
reversed if they want peace in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Makovsky went on to report that "in a recent meeting with a
visiting dignitary, Arafat was unimpressed when the visitor presented
a letter from Egypt's Hosni Mubarak privately calling on Arafat to
crack down on Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Arafat said he will take such
a letter seriously when Mubarak says the same things publicly to his
own people."</TE>
<TE>   These regional leaders are probably scared to death of being
assassinated by their own people if they refute hatred of Israel and
the Jews.</TE>
<TE>   This generation of haters is with us for a while. Our hope is that
the next generation of Palestinian kids will be indoctrinated with
tolerance and respect for others and other religions.</TE>

<TE>   The truth of the matter is that the Arab leaders never cared too
much about the plight of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the West Bank was under Jordanian rule, never was there
talk about a separate country named Palestine nor any concern about
improving the living conditions of those Palestinians. If indeed the
Arab leaders had a genuine interest in establishing a long-lasting
peace in the Middle East, they certainly could do so much more to
exert pressure on Arafat to tamp down the violence. The sad reality
is that the Arab leaders prefer to keep the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict festering to distract attention from their own corrupt
regimes and the lack of freedom for their own Arab people.</TE>

of Palestine who have publicly confessed to organizing and
sanctioning the slaughter of Jewish civilians--and in the course of
those attacks innocent people are killed or hurt, the world screams
foul. Are Jews held to a higher moral standard?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles does not have to have an African American police chief,
or a Hispanic, Asian or Caucasian police chief. We need a competent
chief who can lead the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   I do not know if that person is Bernard Parks. I am gathering as
much information as I can in order to decide. Why is the police union
so opposed to the chief? What are its specific concerns? Why is the
LAPD low on personnel? What is the story about the senior lead
officers? What is the role of the chief with regard to some of the
police officer performance problems that I have observed?</LD>
<LD>   These are just some of the questions. None pertain to racial
considerations. Long ago these were deemed improper and illegal if
used in making employment decisions. It is ironic that these laws
were shaped primarily through the African American civil rights
movement and now some vocal leaders of the black community assert
that we should consider race as a hiring and firing criterion with
regard to the position of police chief.</LD>

<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to your Feb. 10 editorial ("Chief: Walk Away Proud"),
Parks should not apply to be reappointed chief because he is opposed
by Mayor James Hahn. If the mayor's opposition mandates the chief not
being reappointed or even applying, then there is no need for the
Police Commission, which has the responsibility of selecting the
chief.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the black political, religious and community leaders
enthusiastically supported Hahn. This support was based primarily on
his father's legacy and what they thought was a promise by Mayor
Hahn, if not to support Chief Parks for reappointment, to at least
let the process work fairly and allow Parks to be judged on his
record of accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who supported [mayoral candidate] Antonio Villaraigosa
(and also Parks) felt that he was honest in his position of being
noncommittal on Parks until the proper review of his record was
impartially made.</TE>
<TE>   We also felt that Hahn was "carrying water on both shoulders" in
securing the support of both the leaders of the black community and
the police union.</TE>

<TE>   I applaud your editorial about Chief Parks. After almost four
decades of wonderful service to Angelenos, maybe it is time for some
other more challenging career in law enforcement for Parks--maybe
giving a hand, with his years of experience, to the newly created
Afghan administration in the training of its police force.</TE>
<TE>   One of the former New York City police chiefs (now he is back
again under new Mayor Michael Bloomberg) did that for Haiti for a
time.</TE>

<TE>   Congratulations for presenting, in the same issue, two sides of
the question, what is America (or Los Angeles) about?</TE>
<TE>   Frank del Olmo says, "Don't get mad, get even at the polls"
(Commentary, Feb. 10), not just continuing but intensifying the
ethnic conflicts in the city. Indeed, his metaphor is war. "So if
black activists can't convince the Police Commission to . . . give
Bernie Parks another term as chief, it won't mean they lost the war.
They can bide their time, like Latinos are doing, and plan for some
political payback at election time." At least Del Olmo does not
recommend taking to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory Rodriguez ("Private Lives That Belie Public Words,"
Opinion), on the other hand, complains, "For too long, Angelenos have
defined 'community' racially," and writes, "If we are going to cohere
as one city, we must redefine community in geographic terms and
eliminate the anachronistic racial vocabulary we have inherited."
Does an elected minority leader represent an ethnicity or a
geographical district? Does an appointed school superintendent
represent his/her ethnicity or gender, or the children of the school
district? Does the appointed minority police chief serve his/her
ethnicity or the residents of the city?</TE>
<TE>   If only Del Olmo and other minority leaders would support a
government of the people, by the people and for the people that acts
for the greater good, then the real issues could be faced.</TE>

<TE>   Having been an officer on the LAPD at that time, I can tell you
without doubt that the union and the chief had a dysfunctional
relationship at best, for many reasons. There was no love lost
between the union and the chief. One should dare to explore the real
issues and become informed before jumping to a racist-painting
conclusion!</TE>

<BD>--From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Baptist Convention's North American Mission Board has
decided to no longer endorse ordained female chaplains.</LD>
<LD>   The action, taken at a trustee meeting last week, reflects another
adaptation of denominational policy after revisions of the faith
statement of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.</LD>
<LD>   The board oversees the work of the Chaplains Commission, which
endorses chaplains to work in such areas as prisons, hospitals and
businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Mission Board spokesman Martin King said 2,600 chaplains are
endorsed by the denomination, including 235 women. Ninety-four of
those women are ordained. He said the decision "applies to future
endorsements."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--After Muslim and Arab American organizations wrote
letters of complaint, the Justice Department has denied that Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft characterized mainline Islam in an offensive
manner.</LD>
<LD>   The Council on American-Islamic Relations was among the
organizations that voiced concern about a report they said appeared
on the Christian Internet site Crosswalk.com from an interview
Ashcroft gave late last year to syndicated columnist Cal Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   According to Thomas, Ashcroft said: "Islam is a religion in which
God requires you to send your son to die for him. Christianity is a
faith in which God sends his son to die for you."</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department spokeswoman Susan Dryden told the Washington
Post that Ashcroft's statement reflected views of terrorists and not
mainstream Muslims.</TE>

<LD>WASHINGTON--A coalition of religious groups is urging Congress to
pass the now-revived campaign finance reform bill, saying it will
help ensure that "our political system is fair and equitable."</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to members of the House of Representatives, the nine
Jewish, Catholic and mainline Protestant groups said the bill
provides for "reasonable changes in a campaign financing system in
desperate need of repair."</LD>
<LD>   "As sure as apathy, cynicism and mistrust work against religious
principles, so are they enemies of a healthy democracy," the letter
said.</LD>

<LD>LOUISVILLE, Ky.--The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) committee on social
policy has agreed to drop its stance that a late-term, viable fetus
may be aborted if there is a lack of resources or commitment to care
for a child, the Presbyterian News Service reported.</LD>
<LD>   The social policy committee and a committee on litigation
negotiated differences and will make a joint recommendation to the
church's June national assembly.</LD>
<LD>   The compromise approves abortions after viability if necessary "to
save the life of the woman, to preserve the woman's health in
circumstances of a serious risk to the health of the woman, to avoid
fetal suffering as a result of untreatable, life-threatening genetic
anomalies, or in cases of incest or rape."</LD>

endorsed weekly observance.</LD>
<LD>   The panel is developing a paper on the theology and practice of
Communion for the 2004 General Conference of the denomination.</LD>
<LD>   The committee said weekly practice would enrich worship and fit
the practice of Methodist founder John Wesley, though it does not
plan to seek to legislation mandating it, the United Methodist News

<LD>PHILADELPHIA--Disputing some doomsayers, a University of Pennsylvania
School of Social Work report says, "Today's youth exhibit the same
religious trends as previous generations, if not more."</LD>
<LD>   That conclusion stems from a newly reported 2000 poll of 2,004
young people ages 11 to 18. It found that 50.5% considered religion
"extremely" or "very important," with an additional 33.2% saying
religion is "fairly important." Importance ranked highest among girls
and blacks, and declined among older teenagers.</LD>

revamped New International Version in 1997 issued a statement asking
the International Bible Society and Zondervan Publishing House to

<HD>Enron Tax Payments Are Probed</HD>
<DH>Investigation: A Senate panel wants to know if the energy
trader used accounting provisions to avoid payment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Senate committee moved Friday to answer one of the stubborn
questions surrounding Enron Corp.'s collapse: Did the energy giant
pay federal income taxes, or did it use off-shore shelters and
accounting tricks to avoid Uncle Sam?</LD>
<LD>   Enron has insisted that it paid $112 million in taxes in 2000, but
an analysis this year by the advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice
claimed Enron paid nothing, thanks largely to a tax provision that
permits giant deductions for issuing employee stock options.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chair of the Senate Finance
Committee, launched a formal investigation after Enron said it would
waive federal confidentiality rules so that its tax returns can be
discussed publicly at hearings or in committee reports.</LD>
<TE>   "This investigation will be a thorough and comprehensive probe to
gather the facts surrounding Enron's abrupt downfall to determine
whether Enron may have engaged in aggressive tax planning to
improperly avoid paying federal income taxes or exploited loopholes
in our tax system requiring attention," Baucus said.</TE>
<TE>   He ordered the Joint Committee on Taxation to spearhead the
inquiry, which is expected to take several months. The committee also
will review whether Enron's compensation plans, some of which
received substantial tax benefits, adequately protected workers.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the committee Thursday, Enron attorney Fred T.
Goldberg Jr. said the company agreed to waive its confidentiality
rights with the understanding that its tax returns would be used to
address broader tax policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that the committee is interested in determining
whether there are, in the events that gave rise to Enron's
bankruptcy, significant tax policy issues of relevance beyond Enron's
particular circumstances such that they may need to be addressed
through changes to the federal tax laws," Goldberg wrote.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokeswoman cautioned that the company does not have tax
records for some of the off-the-books partnerships, which were
controlled by former employees. Nor can Enron waive confidentiality
rules for outside partnerships, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's use of deductions for issuing stock options is already
drawing scrutiny from lawmakers. Under current tax rules, companies
may take deductions for the expense of issuing stock options, even if
they don't report the expense on their income statement.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) has introduced a bill--opposed by many
business groups--that would require companies to treat stock options
similarly on their tax returns and income statements.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, and Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) plan to
send a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and Labor Department, seeking records about any complaints they
received about Enron and any communications between the agencies and
the company and its auditor, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Enron disclosed that former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay
sold $20 million in Enron stock in the three weeks after he was
warned by Sherron S. Watkins in August that the company might
collapse amid accounting scandals, the Wall Street Journal reported
on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The company had earlier disclosed that Lay sold blocks of 1,000 to
4,000 shares, worth a total of $29.9 million, almost every day last
year through July. Lay's sales of Enron stock totaled $100 million,
the company said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Documents were released showing that Lay wrote repeatedly to
then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, seeking support for legislation
benefiting the energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   Many letters concerned utility deregulation and tort reform. About
350 pages of correspondence were released by state archivists.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush signed a law deregulating the electricity market in
1999, the documents do not appear to show that Bush responded in
print to Lay's interest in the issue.</TE>

From plundered Play Stations to embezzlement, employee theft is
estimated to have cost the retailers an estimated $15 billion--a
record--in 2000, according to the National Retail Security Survey,
one of the oldest and most respected reports on retail "shrinkage,"
the industry term for theft, fraud and other unexplained losses.</SN>

<HD>Retailers Taking Aim at Employee Pilferage</HD>
<DH>Security: Studies show worker theft accounts for 46% of
losses, posing a greater threat to store owners than shoplifters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim O'Connor knows he's sent some of his co-workers to jail.</LD>
<LD>   As vice president in charge of loss prevention for Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.-based Mars Music, O'Connor is chief architect of the
company's aggressive approach to combating employee theft.</LD>
<LD>   It's a line of defense that includes prosecuting 70% to 80% of the
employees caught stealing from the chain, which sells new and vintage
musical instruments and high-end recording equipment. It features
cameras trained on every register and a hotline that allows employees
to blow the whistle on pilfering colleagues. "To outfit a new store
[with security devices], we spend about $40 grand," O'Connor said.</LD>
<TE>   "There's been a general shift in retailing," said O'Connor, who
has been with 5-year-old company for four years. "We've gotten other
things cleaned up. Internal theft is where we're losing our dollars.
It's a very small group of employees stealing a large amount of
money."</TE>
<TE>   After years of trying to stem retail losses by watching out for
shoppers with sticky fingers, retailers are increasingly aiming their
anti-theft weapons at their employees, studies show, and
criminologists and retailers confirm.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that the retailing industry's techno-assault on
shoplifting--launched about 20 years ago with the advent of bulky
sensor tags--has slowed the rate of growth in shoplifting losses, and
in some retail segments has resulted in a drop in shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, experts say, employees have been busy at the cash
register and in the back room.</TE>
<TE>   From plundered PlayStations to diverted dollars, employee theft is
estimated to have cost retailers a record $15 billion in 2000,
according to the National Retail Security Survey, which tracks trends
in retail "shrinkage," the industry term for theft, fraud and other
unexplained losses.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus on dishonest employees now may be higher than it's ever
been," said Mark R. Doyle, vice president of Florida-based Jack L.
Hayes International Inc., a consulting firm that helps businesses,
especially retailers, reduce fraud losses.</TE>
<TE>   Employee fraud cuts across business segments, from retailing to
insurance to medicine, experts said. Retailers have been among the
most active in trying to document and attack the problem. At least
three studies released last year show that employee theft posses a
bigger threat to them than "boosters," as shoplifters are known in
the vernacular.</TE>
<TE>   The National Retail Security Survey, with data from 2000, showed
that among 116 of the largest U.S.-based retail chains, employee
theft accounted for 46% of losses, compared with 31% for shoplifting.
By comparison, data from 1991 (the oldest comparable survey
available) pegged shoplifting as the leading cause of loss--at 38.4%
it barely edged out employee theft, which was 37.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Loss prevention experts are split on the causes of the apparent
shift toward internal pilfering. Some cited inroads retailers have
made in addressing shoplifting, which reduced the portion of the loss
"pie" attributable to outsiders. Some blamed the economy for stepping
up the financial pressure on cash-strapped cashiers. In the boom
economy of the '90s, others said, some employers skipped background
checks in an effort to hire new recruits. In the process,
less-than-desirable workers slipped in.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity to make sure you were getting honest employees at
every turn became harder," said Britt Wood, a vice president with the
International Mass Retail Assn. in Arlington, Va. "You needed to get
somebody in there, so you had to make compromises."</TE>
<TE>   Wood said that for some of the nation's largest retailers, the
yearly growth in shoplifting losses is beginning to slow.</TE>
<TE>   "Now there's more of a plateau," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some loss prevention professionals contend that the proportion of
internal thievery has remained relatively constant over the years.
The difference, they say, is the new focus by retailers, which has
lead to more employee thieves getting caught.</TE>
<TE>   A study released by Hayes International last year showed that 30
U.S.-based retail chains--with 2000 sales of $355 billion--caught
73,326 dishonest employees in 2000, a 10% increase over the 1999
figure. Those employers recovered an estimated $56.12 million in cash
and stolen goods for an average cash value of $765.41. That's more
than six times the shoplifting average of $114.07.</TE>
<TE>   In six of the last seven years, the number of employees caught
stealing and the amount of loot recovered has increased by double
digits compared with the previous year, Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   A report released last month by the National Supermarket Research
Group, which tracked thefts at supermarkets and convenience stores
since 1990, showed the ratio of internal and external fairly constant
over the last decade--averaging about 54% for employee theft to 24%
for shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Horan, director of loss prevention with Gordon Bros. Group,
which handles liquidation sales for ailing retailers, said that may
be because the grocery industry has not used technology to reduce
shoplifting to the same extent as vendors of clothing and hard goods.</TE>
<TE>   The grocery study said total losses, as percentage of sales, have
remained at plus or minus 2%--small but still the equivalent of
billions in lost profits.</TE>
<TE>   "The previous focus on shoplifting did not reduce total shrink,"
said Larry Miller, director of the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based
supermarket research group. "So the retailer says, 'If I'm focusing
so much on shoplifting, and it's not reducing my shrink I'd better
focus on something else: employee theft.'"</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Horan said retailers today are using technology to more
closely track employee activity--everything from software that spots
a cashier with an unusually high number of refunds to smart tags that
can be placed on something as small as a bottle of aspirin.</TE>
<TE>   "The same technology that beat down shoplifting in the mid-'90s is
being retooled to address employee theft in the new century," Horan
said. In the works, experts said, are "auto ID" computer chips
sophisticated enough to tell you that a carton of cigarettes left
through the back door at 10 p.m. on Thursday. Although some
shopkeepers swear by the increased use of surveillance equipment,
some privacy experts wonder what the move will do to employee morale.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to work in an environment where every time you
blow your nose ... it's on videotape," said Lewis Maltby, president
of the National Workrights Institute in Princeton, N.J., a spinoff of
the ACLU.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting a camera on every register is a real hardship on the
employees and it shouldn't be done unless it's absolutely necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Mars Music's O'Connor said that, because of privacy concerns,
cameras were not installed in places such as break rooms. But he said
use of cameras was promoted to employees as a safety feature. "It's a
big key to controlling shrink."</TE>
<TE>   Some retailers have opted to address the problem by focusing on
who they put behind the cash register. Mal Ransom, vice president of
Marina del Rey-based US Search Inc., said he's seen more interest
from retailers who want to use background screening to combat the
twin problems of employee theft and high turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers need to increase the bottom line," he said. "And the
fact is that employee turnover and theft costs them money."</TE>

<HD>Icahn Seeks Clearance to Buy 40% of ImClone</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Investor's filing is seen as a 'vote of
confidence' that cancer drug Erbitux eventually will be approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THERESA AGOVINO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is seeking antitrust approval to
purchase $500 million of ImClone Systems Inc. stock, about 40% of the
company.</LD>
<LD>   The troubled biotech company announced Friday that Icahn filed
documents with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
Justice to clear the way for him to buy the stock.</LD>
<LD>   Icahn's filing triggered ImClone's takeover defense provision,
which would take effect after an investor acquires 15% of the stock
and make it prohibitively expensive to acquire more.</LD>
<TE>   "It is only prudent for us to put in a stockholder rights plan.
The shares are trading at a low valuation," said Andrew Merrill, a
spokesman for ImClone. "Our view is that Icahn's intentions are a
vote of confidence. Sophisticated investors don't make such large
investments lightly."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the plan would probably thwart any attempt by Icahn
to take over the company, making the filing a sideshow in the ImClone
drama. "I think the whole thing is a moot point because he can't get
control now," said Patrick Mooney, a biotech analyst at Thomas
Weisel.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Icahn was simply trying to cheaply acquire a major
stake in what one day may be a profitable company. Last fall, Bristol
Myers-Squibb paid $1 billion to acquire 19.9% of ImClone. Since then,
however, ImClone's fortunes have been declining steadily and its
relationship with Bristol Myers has deteriorated into a public feud.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Food and Drug Administration refused to accept
ImClone's application to review Erbitux, a cancer drug touted as a
blockbuster. The rejection sent ImClone stock into a tailspin and
prompted a rash of shareholder lawsuits alleging fraud, which in turn
touched off three federal investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers also wanted to restructure the terms of its
$2-billion deal, seeking to change ImClone's leadership temporarily,
give it control of Erbitux and garner a larger portion of the
profits. ImClone rejected the deal this week.</TE>
<TE>   Many still believe that Erbitux is a viable drug that will
eventually be approved. Icahn would be handsomely rewarded by buying
a stake in ImClone at a bargain basement price. ImClone rose 84
cents, or about 4.8%, to $18.44 Friday on Nasdaq. It has dropped more
than 70% since late December.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn has previously taken stakes in companies such as Nabisco
Group Holdings Corp., Trans World Airlines Inc. and Texaco Inc. to
force changes in management or company strategy. Last year, he
attempted a takeover of Visx Inc., a maker of eye surgery lasers.
Icahn didn't return a phone call requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   Icahn has had previous ties with ImClone and its Chief Executive
Samuel Waksal. An investment group led by Icahn acquired a 5.1% stake
in ImClone in October 1999. Waksal also was part of a proposed slate
of directors that Icahn tried to nominate to the Visx board last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Jim McCamant, a contributing analyst at the brokerage firm Moors
Cabot, believes Icahn may be stepping in to help his friend by buying
a stake in the company, acting to counterbalance Bristol. Bristol
didn't return calls for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Carl likes to be a player," McCamant said. "Carl likes to make
money and he can make some money here."</TE>
<TE>   "He's taking a bet that Bristol-Myers' working with the product
will allow it to get approved, and based on that, ImClone is worth a
lot more than $15 a share," said Jon Fisher, a health-care analyst
with Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati who holds shares of Bristol-Myers
and doesn't hold ImClone shares. "I don't think Icahn is assuming
it'll get approved this year, but he's thinking it will be approved
in '03 or '04."</TE>

<HD>For Many, the Olympic Boon Is a Bust</HD>
<DH>Winter Games: Many businesses find it tough to cash in as
locals stay home and visitors are whisked from venues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Olympics were supposed to pump $1.2 billion into the coffers of
Utah businesses, giving the Salt Lake City area an envious boost in a
sluggish U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   But halfway through the 2002 Winter Games, Melva Sine, president
of the Utah Restaurant Assn., is among those who have all but given
up.</LD>
<LD>   "Business is worse than if we hadn't had the Olympics here at
all," she said, projecting an overall drop of 10% in receipts for the
area's 2,500 restaurants by the time the Games end Feb. 24. "We just
have not seen the big spike that everybody was getting all hyped up
for. It's really too bad."</LD>
<TE>   Tourism leaders had projected 70,000 to 100,000 visitors daily
during the Olympics. And there are pockets where business is booming:
Hotels in downtown Salt Lake City are sold out, and Park City, with
its tight-knit Main Street, outdoor beer tents and popular propane
warming stations, is hopping.</TE>
<TE>   But many merchants throughout the region are complaining because
regular customers have been scared off by warnings of gridlock, big
crowds and parking headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration abounds in Salt Lake's outlying areas, where hotels
still have rooms available and shops and restaurants are struggling
to attract customers.</TE>
<TE>   "You could drive a race car down our freeways," grumbled Carol
Bohm, who manages an antique store and coffee shop in Ogden, about 35
miles north of Salt Lake City. "Someone needs to get the word out."</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson tried to do just that this
week, holding a news conference to urge locals to "come on out" and
stressing how easy it is to get around, park, eat and spend. Parking
lot operators who had planned to charge $50 a car at prime lots
within walking distance of the downtown core have had to slash the
price to $15 because too many spaces were going unused.</TE>
<TE>   "All anybody heard for a full month leading up to the Olympics
was: 'Don't drive unless you have to, avoid downtown, parking will be
a nightmare,'" said Sine, who has asked Salt Lake City officials to
spend more money on marketing aimed at residents. "So the locals have
either gone out of town, or they're doing what they were told.
They're staying away."</TE>
<TE>   David Baird, economic development director of the downtown
business district organization, agreed that local residents have
avoided the festivities "more than we would have liked," but he said
it is too early to determine the Winter Games' ultimate financial
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," he said, "the real economic impact is going to be seen
long after the Games are gone."</TE>
<TE>   "I like to look past the $1 billion we're projecting for 14 days
of events and focus on the long term. Salt Lake City has been
introduced to the world, and you can't put a dollar figure on that
kind of exposure," Baird said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, businesses are grappling with other problems, such as
security measures that have reduced customer traffic. Because
visitors are shuttled to and from venues in outlying area, they are
not staying around to browse through shops or dine at restaurants as
they would if they didn't have a bus to catch back to the city,
merchants said.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Fox, who manages the Country Corner deli about 50 miles
outside of Salt Lake in the Heber Valley, said shuttles packed with
visitors roll past her community on the way to Soldier Hollow, where
the Nordic combined skiing event is being held.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't stop," she said with a sigh. "They blow right by."</TE>
<TE>   It's a similar story around the E-Center ice arena, nine miles
south of downtown. When the crowds leave the hockey games, they climb
aboard shuttles and head straight for downtown, restaurant employees
say. So several eateries, including Applebee's and Chili's, already
have laid off the extra workers hired before the Games began.</TE>
<TE>   But even downtown, with the Olympic Medals Plaza, blocks of
corporate sponsor tents and Olympic superstores to attract tourists,
some merchants still believe that they are missing out. Others say
visitors are not spending as much as hoped and openly long for the
usual skiing tourist crowds that normally spill through the Salt Lake
City area this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not right there in front of their noses, you don't get
the business," said Phil Bollen, whose contemporary art and jewelry
store is tucked in the basement of a downtown office building. "Oh,
and if you're not selling something with the Olympic logo on it, you
won't even get a second glance."</TE>
<TE>   But around the corner and down an alley at the Dead Goat Saloon,
where a pint of beer is going for $5 compared with $2 last month,
owner Dan Darger said he was pleased with the way business was going.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody was all geared up for it to be totally insane,
and it hasn't been insane," he said. "But it has been good. We've had
crowds, and they've all been fun. It's a good pace."</TE>
<TE>   Although downtown Salt Lake is capturing the biggest crowds,
officials and business owners say it is nearby Park City that has
emerged as the darling of the Olympics, with outdoor video screens, a
dance platform and live concerts dominating the scene until the bars
close at 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   With 45,000 people a day funneling into Park City, restaurateurs
such as Greg Schirf are left wondering what all the grumbling is
about.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going nuts here," said Schirf, who runs the Wasatch Brew
Pub and has twice nearly run out of his popular Polygamy Porter
microbrew. "We're making 200 more lunches a day than we anticipated
and at least that many more dinners. Business is better than I ever
dreamed."</TE>

<HD>PayPal Jumps 55% on Stock Offering</HD>
<DH>Internet: After a one-week IPO delay, the online payment
service makes a strong debut amid 'anemic' market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PayPal Inc. shares surged 55% on Friday as the online payment
provider became the first Internet company to go public in almost a
year and notched the strongest trading debut in nine months.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts warned, however, that the overall market for initial
public offerings remains "anemic." They said fast-growing PayPal, a
favorite of EBay Inc.'s auction Web site users, faces a cloudy future
because of legal and regulatory questions.</LD>
<LD>   "Two weeks ago, I considered this deal 'best in show' for the
first quarter. Now all the uncertainty casts a long and dark shadow
as to what is going to happen with this company," said David Menlow,
president of IPOFinancial.com, which analyzes new stock offerings.</LD>
<TE>   PayPal's IPO was delayed one week because of an 11th-hour
patent-infringement suit by rival CertCo Inc. The company also has
been dogged by regulators in California, Louisiana and other states
who are concerned that the company might be operating as an
unregulated bank.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say PayPal also could face rising competition from the
likes of Citigroup Inc.'s payment site C2it.com and EBay's BillPoint
service.</TE>
<TE>   But shares of Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal surged $7.09 to
close at $20.09 on Nasdaq as investors apparently shrugged off any
concerns. The company raised $70.2 million late Thursday by selling
5.4 million shares at $13 through lead underwriter Salomon Smith
Barney, which is owned by Citigroup. The stock trades under the
symbol PYPL.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal had the biggest first-day jump since Simplex Solutions Inc.
gained 77% in May. Though such first-day gains often prove to be
over-hyped and short-lived, PayPal's debut was seen as a sign of hope
for technology investors.</TE>
<TE>   PayPal is the first Internet IPO since Loudcloud Inc. went public
in March. Since the tech stock bubble burst in spring 2000, investors
have turned icy toward the sector.</TE>
<TE>   Like most Internet companies, PayPal is unprofitable, but analysts
are impressed by its robust sales growth and status as the leader in
its niche. PayPal, which had 12,000 customers at the start of 2000,
now has nearly 13 million. Revenue surged from $14.5 million in 2000
to $104.8 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   "P2P," or person-to-person payments through online services such
as PayPal, are expected to grow to $13.2 billion in 2006, up from
$2.1 billion in 2001, said James Van Dyke, research director of
Jupiter Media Metrix.</TE>
<TE>   Still, PayPal has racked up $277 million in net losses the last
two fiscal years, Menlow said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Friday's trading may indicate investors believe the company
can turn a profit in the not-too-distant future, Menlow said a
regulatory clampdown or a successful lawsuit could upend its business
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dyke, however, said PayPal could reach an accord with
regulators regarding the interest payments it makes on deposited
funds, the main point of contention with state officials. That
wouldn't affect PayPal's core business--transferring money without
using a credit card.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how PayPal fares, analysts say it's far too soon to
sing "Happy Days Are Here Again" for the IPO market.</TE>
<TE>   "The backlog of deals is still anemic, and we're off to the
slowest start this year in more than two decades," said Richard
Peterson, market strategist at Thomson Financial, noting that only
eight companies have gone public in 2002. "The IPO market isn't like
1999 again--but then again, what is?"</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said the IPO market is still likely to be dominated by
multibillion-dollar spinoffs such as Verizon Wireless out of Verizon
Communications Inc., Travelers out of Citigroup Inc. and Medco out of
Merck &amp; Co. Those deals are expected later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson warned that strong debut trading offers little or no clue
about a stock's longer-term prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Of the last 10 IPOs to rise 100% or more in their debuts, nine now
trade below the offer price, let alone the first-day close.</TE>
<TE>   Menlow also cautioned against reading too much into PayPal's
success.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this signals the all-clear for Internet IPOs," he
said. "Those people who think there's a new era for Internet stocks
are flirting with their financial well-being."</TE>

<HD>Edison Posts a Profit of $2.2 Billion</HD>
<DH>Earnings: A pact with California regulators to maintain
rates helps the energy firm with a $2.1-billion gain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International on Friday reported a fourth-quarter profit of
$2.2 billion, boosted by a massive one-time $2.1-billion gain linked
to a pact with state regulators designed to save its utility
subsidiary Southern California Edison from bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The pact allows Edison to maintain retail rates at current high
levels, despite a recession-linked sharp decline in wholesale prices.
In so doing, the utility should recover about $3.6 billion of past
costs incurred buying power for its customers. That total translates
to an after-tax gain of $2.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, prevented from collecting those costs by a retail
price freeze imposed under California's deregulation legislation, it
had been forced to take a charge of about $2.5 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Edison said the pact with state regulators now makes "recovery of
those costs probable."</TE>
<TE>   The Rosemead-based company reported a "core" fourth-quarter loss
of $11 million, or 3 cents a share, excluding one-time items,
compared with a loss of $37 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The narrower fourth-quarter loss was mainly due to higher
operating profit of $121 million, or 37 cents a share, earned by SCE,
up from $30 million, or 9 cents, in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   The company's Edison Mission Energy unit, an independent power
producer, reported a quarterly loss from continuing operations of $97
million, or 30 cents a share, versus a loss of $46 million, or 14
cents a share, in the same quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The latest quarter also included items such as a loss of $25
million, or 7 cents a share, at a new unit, Mission Energy Holding
Co., which incurred interest expenses after issuing new debt as the
company struggled to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver told
analysts that the pact with regulators should allow SCE to clear its
defaults and arrears with a total payment of $5.5billion to creditors
scheduled for March 1.</TE>
<TE>   Craver said the utility is in the process of raising bridge
financing of about $1.6 billion to help pay the debt. J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. and Citibank are in the process of syndicating the
financing, he added.</TE>
<TE>   This will be combined with the utility's cash on hand, which stood
at $3.4 billion at the end of 2001 and is expected to total about
$3.8billion by the end of February.</TE>
<TE>   Craver said Moody's Investors Service had given the bridge
financing a provisional "Ba2" rating and Standard &amp; Poor's has rated
it "BB."</TE>
<TE>   Both ratings are described as at the low end of medium-grade, or
somewhat speculative.</TE>
<TE>   Edison shares closed down 12 cents at $15.14 in trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Since October, the stock has gained about 16%,
boosted by the pact with California regulators.</TE>

<HD>Globalstar Seeking to Restructure Operations</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Firm files for Chapter 11 protection, as it had
warned. Service is expected to continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Globalstar said Friday that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, as it had warned it would three months ago, under a
restructuring plan worked out in advance with its major creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Globalstar was launched in 1994 with the goal of creating a global
mobile telephone system for business travelers and others but was
hurt by high operating costs, heavy and unattractive handsets and the
steep rates charged to customers.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose-based company said it expects operations for its
66,000 remaining customers to continue uninterrupted.</LD>
<TE>   Globalstar had liabilities of  $3.4 billion at the time of its
filing in federal court in Delaware, spokesman Mac Jeffery said. He
could not immediately provide an asset total.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it had  $46 million in cash but would require new
investment after it emerges from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Under the restructuring plan, which requires Bankruptcy Court
approval, Globalstar would create a new company that would be owned
by its current bondholders and other unsecured creditors.</TE>
<TE>   The new entity would acquire the equity stakes held by Global
partners, which include Qualcomm Inc., Vodafone Group and Loral Space
&amp; Communications Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffery said shareholders in the partnership entities may get the
opportunity to buy shares in the new company, which may or may not
carry the Globalstar name.</TE>

<HD>Australia OKs Calif. Grapes</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Long impasse ends with agreement to import the
fruit under rules to limit risks from pests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending a decade-long impasse, Australia has agreed to allow the
importation of California table grapes.</LD>
<LD>   The move came after U.S. officials met Australian demands to limit
the risks of pests that could be brought in through shipments.</LD>
<LD>   The move could aid Australia's effort to negotiate a free-trade
agreement with the United States. Australia's market has long been
closed to imported grapes.</LD>
<TE>   Australia had banned California's second-largest agricultural
product for more than a decade to protect its wine grape and tree
fruit industries from pests and diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Just when California grapes were to be allowed in last year,
another ban was instituted amid growing concerns about the
glassy-winged sharpshooter, an insect that spreads bacteria deadly to
grapevines.</TE>
<TE>   Entomologists said the risk from the pest was very small, because
it feeds on the grapevine's leaves and not on grapes themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Trade officials called the ban protectionist, but Australian
agriculture officials said it was necessary to protect the country's
large tree fruit industry.</TE>
<TE>   Chile and Mexico also seek access into the Australian market.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new guidelines, California table grapes must be
fumigated with methyl bromide before they are shipped over.
Australian quarantine officials also must sample and inspect fruit
being shipped.</TE>
<TE>   California grape industry officials say the restrictions are
excessive and unnecessary; the heavy application of fumigant could
decompose many grapes in transit, they say. Australian Embassy
officials contend the measures are strict but fair and were
negotiated with the aid of Department of Agriculture officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a country that is essentially disease-free. We need to
keep [quarantine] standards that allow us to be renown for the
quality of food we export," said Sandi Logan, an Australian Embassy
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Australia will not be one of California's top export destinations.
But officials here initially thought it would add as much as $19
million to the coffers of the state's 600 growers.</TE>
<TE>   With the expense and risk of the rules, grape industry officials
say, few of the state's growers will try to access the market.</TE>
<TE>   "This just cracks the door open," said Kathleen Nave, president of
the California Table Grape Commission. "But by cracking the door open
we hope to prove to the Australians that it is safe for them to
eliminate a lot of these mitigation [requirements]."</TE>

<LD>Edison Schools Inc., the largest private U.S. manager of public
schools, explained for the first time in a regulatory filing that the
company counts as revenue some money that it never gets.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Chief Financial Officer Adam Feild, in response to a
conference call question, said about 50% of its $375.8 million in
revenue for fiscal 2001, ended June30, was never actually received.</LD>
<LD>   Edison Chief Executive Christopher Whittle said that his company
has been recording some revenue it never received for seven years.
The company added a new paragraph about that policy in the 10-Q
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   Edison, which started managing schools in 1995, has accumulated
losses totaling more than $230 million since it began in 1992,
including more than $120 million over the last three years. Its
reported revenue has soared to $375.8 million in fiscal 2001, from
$11.8 million in fiscal 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Edison shares fell 29 cents to $12.46 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Bank of America Corp. plans to cut $15 billion from its outstanding
loans during the next two years as it weeds out corporate borrowers
that refuse to give the bank more profitable business.</LD>
<LD>   The Charlotte, N.C.-based company is the second-biggest arranger
of syndicated loans in the U.S. and already has reduced loans on its
books to $65 billion from $99 billion in August 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The bank will trim that to "$50 billion or below," said Edward
Brown, president of global corporate and investment banking.</LD>
<TE>   Banks are reining in risk as recession and rising unemployment

<LD>Halliburton Co. shares rose 11% after a federal judge issued a
temporary stay on more than 200,000 pending asbestos claims against
its Dresser Industries unit.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Dallas-based oil field services and construction
firm closed up $1.61 at $16.27. Halliburton was the
seventh-most-actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   Halliburton's announcement helped lift shares of chemical firm
W.R. Grace &amp; Co. 4.8%, to $2.42, and stock of construction materials
maker USG Corp. 4.3%, to $8.50, both on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   The stay on the Dresser lawsuits will remain in place until a
hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pennsylvania. The hearing is
expected in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   RHI, the largest maker of fireproofing materials, said that its

<HD>SCAN HMO Lays Off 13% of Work Force</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SCAN Health Plan of Long Beach, part of a long-running experiment in
home-based care for the elderly, faced the hard realities of rising
health care costs Friday when it announced the layoff of 13% of its
work force.</LD>
<LD>   SCAN, which stands for Senior Care Action Network, has been under
pressure from the state Department of Managed Health Care to improve
its financial health. A state spokesman said SCAN failed to meet one
of its financial parameters for HMOs because it did not have enough
tangible net equity.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been working with them on a plan to improve their finances,
and we're going to hold them accountable for doing that," the
spokesman said. He added: "At this point, we don't see their finances
affecting patient care."</LD>
<TE>   Susan Cameron, chief operating officer for SCAN, said that the
layoffs affected about 80 employees and that none was directly
involved in patient care. Cameron blamed low reimbursements for the
care SCAN provides and said it was necessary to "realign to meet
these challenges."</TE>
<TE>   SCAN is a Medicare HMO plan and a nonprofit social service
provider with 52,000 members. It helps patients avoid nursing homes
as long as possible by providing in-home care including meals,
prescription and food deliveries, cleaning services and emergency
care.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, it has been one of only four programs in the nation
with special social HMO status allowing home-based case for those who
might have no other alternative but living in a nursing home.</TE>

<LD>J.C. Penney Co.'s Eckerd drugstore chain is facing a civil
investigation by Florida officials into allegations it overcharged
customers for medicine.</LD>
<LD>   The Florida attorney general's office said on its Web site it is
investigating whether Eckerd overstated on liquid-medicine labels the
amount of medicine in the package and then charged customers for the
amount shown on the label.</LD>
<LD>   A class-action lawsuit filed in Broward County, Fla., accused
Eckerd of bilking customers out of more than $100 million.</LD>
<TE>   The Clearwater, Fla.-based drugstore chain said last week that
prescriptions such as liquids and ointments come from the
manufacturer in prepackaged fractional amounts and are sold to
customers at a price set for that quantity. The quantity, but not the
price, needed to be rounded up to correctly process the drugs because
of "systems limitations," the company has said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney fell 88 cents, or 3.9%,
to close at $21.70 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine Corp. canceled development
of a natural-gas pipeline that would have run from New Mexico to
California, saying they haven't received enough commitments from
pipeline customers.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,030-mile Sonoran Pipeline was to have been a 50-50
partnership between Houston-based Kinder Morgan and San Jose-based
Calpine and was expected to begin service in 2004. Calpine, one of
the largest U.S. power plant builders, originally was going to use
about 50% of the pipeline's capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Kinder Morgan shares rose 5 cents to close at $33.05 on the NYSE.
Calpine shares fell 43 cents to $7.64 on the NYSE.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc., the second-biggest U.S. long-distance telephone
carrier, said an internal audit found that a dozen salespeople
improperly won commissions by billing for sales made by other
employees.</LD>
<LD>   At least three workers in WorldCom's Arlington, Va., office will
be fired or forced to quit for claiming commissions that weren't
theirs, spokesman Brad Burns said. The other employees under scrutiny
had their salaries frozen and also may be fired, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The actions by the salespeople cost WorldCom as much as $4
million, Burns said. He said the company expects to recover the money
and the matter won't affect financial results.</LD>
<TE>   The shares of WorldCom and rivals have fallen this week on
concerns that some telecommunications companies may have to tap into
lines of credit at banks to avoid paying higher commercial borrowing
rates. Qwest Communications International Inc. borrowed $4 billion
after being unable to get loans from money-market investors.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom shares slipped 39 cents to close at $6.73 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>A jury awarded Marvin Windows and Doors $135.8 million from PPG
Industries on its claim that a PPG wood preservative failed to
prevent wood rot as promised.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was handed down Thursday in U.S. District Court in
St. Paul, Minn., and Pittsburgh-based PPG said it would appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Marvin Windows makes made-to-order wood and clad wood windows and
doors. PPG is a global supplier of coatings, glass, fiberglass and
chemicals.</LD>
<TE>   PPG said in a prepared statement that the verdict was unexpected.
The company maintains that its preservative was not defective, saying
it has been in use for 20 years.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer confidence fell this month and industrial production
declined in January, evidence that the economy may be slow in gaining
strength.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for February
fell to 90.9 from 93 last month, a drop that analysts attributed to
worries that Enron Corp. is not the only company to issue misleading
financial reports. The Federal Reserve's index of work performed by
factories, mines and utilities declined 0.1% in January, the 15th
drop in 16 months.</LD>
<LD>   Neither decline is likely to doom the rebound, propelled by the
fastest pace of inventory reduction on record and a rate of consumer
spending unsurpassed in almost two years.</LD>
<TE>   The producer price index rose 0.1% in January, the Labor
Department reported. It was the first increase in four months and was
led by the biggest rise in food costs in almost a year; the index
declined 0.5% in December.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding food and energy, the index fell 0.1% after no change in
December. Producer prices were 2.6% lower than in January 2001, the
biggest 12-month drop since February 1950.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of tame inflation for goods and materials will make
it easier for Fed policymakers to hold down interest rates until the
expected rebound takes hold, and Friday's reports contained reasons
for optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't expect to be confronting a serious inflation problem in
the next several quarters, so my foot is not on the brake," said Gary
Stern, president of the Fed Bank of Minneapolis. Stern is a voting
member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Though confidence fell, it was the first decline in five months,
and the January reading of 93 was the highest in a year. The current
conditions index, which reflects Americans' perception of their
financial situation and their willingness to spend on furniture and
home appliances, rose to 97.2 from 95.7. The expectations index,
based on optimism about the next one to five years, fell to 86.8 from
91.3.</TE>
<TE>   The production report gave signs that manufacturing was gaining
strength. The decline was the smallest since a 0.1% increase in July,
manufacturing itself was unchanged, the manufacture of business
equipment rose for the first time since the factory slump began a
year and a half ago, and more semiconductors were made.</TE>
<TE>   Business equipment production rose 0.4%--the first increase since
August 2000--after a 1.7% decline a month earlier. Production of
computers, communications equipment and semiconductors rose 0.6%
after being unchanged in December.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Cloud Hits IBM; Dow Reverses Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks struggled Friday as fears of improper accounting practices
dogged companies ranging from corporate icon IBM to technology
upstart Nvidia.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have been bailing out of stocks at the first hint of
impropriety since the rash of accounting scandals that began with
fallen energy trader Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Also weighing on investors were reports that consumers reined in
their optimism in early February and U.S. factory output dipped in
January, hinting that a recovery from recession may be slow and
arduous. The data came as a letdown after reports this week showed a
surge in January retail sales, not counting automobiles, and a drop
in weekly initial jobless claims.</LD>
<TE>   "One day people will be excited about the economy, and the [next]
day they will be concerned about further accounting issues," said
Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors. "It's
almost a bipolar market."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 98.95 points, or 1.0%, to
9,903.04. The Dow fell below the 10,000 mark after ending Thursday
above that key level for the first time since Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 38.17 points, or 2.1%, to
1,805.20, ending lower for the third week in a row. The broad
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index dropped 12.30 points, or 1.1%, to
1,104.18.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and were about even on the
New York Stock Exchange. Volume was lackluster ahead of Monday's
Presidents Day holiday, when markets will be closed.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow rose 1.6%, the best week so far this year,
and the S&amp;P 500 added 0.7%. But the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.8%.</TE>
<TE>   IBM slumped $5 to $102.89, dragging on the Dow. The computer giant
came under scrutiny after the New York Times reported that the
company had not disclosed a $300-million gain on the sale of an
optical unit but that it was this gain that enabled IBM to meet
fourth-quarter earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for IBM said it had adequately disclosed the sale of
the unit through two press releases from Canada's JDS Uniphase, which
had bought the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Computer graphics chip maker Nvidia fell $4.81 to $57.35. The
company was stung when it announced an internal investigation after a
Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. Nvidia was the best
performer in the S&amp;P 500 index last year, a distinction it inherited
from Enron, the index's best performer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This accounting cloud is going to hang over the market for a
while," said Milton Ezrati, senior economic strategist at Lord Abbett
&amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Yields on Treasury securities tumbled as accounting concerns
drove investors from stocks and corporate bonds to the safety of
government debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note
fell to 4.85% from 4.94% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * AES fell $2.50 to $7--a 26% loss--on concern that the
devaluation of the Venezuelan currency will hurt income from the
electricity generator's business there. Also, Standard &amp; Poor's said
it may downgrade AES' debt.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom stocks continued their recent slide. Sprint PCS fell 93
cents to $9.27 and Lucent Technologies lost 41 cents to $5.41. The
Amex telecom index fell 1.9% to its lowest level in at least four
years. But Qwest Communications International gained 7 cents to $7.56
after suffering losses earlier in the session because it was forced
to tap into its line of credit and three debt ratings companies
downgraded the company.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Economy Slips 0.3% in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico's economy shrank last year for the first time since 1995, but
unlike that crisis-plagued year, the country's industry appears
poised for a quick rebound.</LD>
<LD>   The finance ministry said Friday that Mexico's gross domestic
product shrank 1.6% in 2001's final three months, compared with the
year-ago period, as the country remained mired in a slump brought on
by the U.S. economic slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   For all of 2001, GDP contracted 0.3%, marking Mexico's first year
without growth since 1995, when GDP fell 6.2% in the wake of a
disastrous peso devaluation.</LD>
<TE>   Although economists see the 1995 recession as mostly self- induced
by government mismanagement, Mexico's current downturn is the result
of its close ties to the U.S. business cycle, which is showing signs
of recovery from a recession that began in March.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's economy posted growth of 6.9% in 2000 but was undermined
last year as demand for the country's exports slowed in the United
States, the destination for about 85% of its sales abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Friday's GDP data showed the country's industrial sector
hardest hit in 2001, falling 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 3.5% for
the full year. Manufacturing fell 3.9% in the year.</TE>
<TE>   But economists point to emerging signs of a U.S. recovery, which
signals better times ahead for Mexican exporters.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the U.S. government reported that consumers spent much
more than expected in January, with sales at U.S. retailers excluding
auto dealers growing 1.2%--the strongest rise in nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Conference Board said Thursday that its leading
indicator for Mexico rose 0.6% in December, snapping a five-month
declining streak.</TE>
<TE>   Economists see Mexico's GDP contracting by 0.7% in the first
quarter, then growing 0.6% in the second quarter, 2.1% in the third
and 3.5% in the fourth, according to the latest poll by Mexico's
Central Bank. Estimates for all of 2002 are for growth of about 1.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican consumers remained resilient in 2001, despite the
industrial slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's data showed that the economy's services sector, which
includes retailers, telephone companies and transporters, rose 1.1%
in the full year, despite a 0.8% drop in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<HD>Sprint to Cut 3,000 Jobs, Shut Five Service Centers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint PCS, in a cost-cutting move, said Friday that it would fire
about 3,000 employees and close five of its 13 customer call service
centers, including the Irvine operation, where 1,100 people will lose
their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Verizon Wireless, the industry's largest
company, said it is cutting 1,000 employees--about 2% of its work
force--as the industry faces a slowdown in new subscribers after
years of frenetic growth.</LD>
<LD>   With about 45% of the U.S. population owning cellular telephones,
adding new customers has become increasingly difficult. During the
fourth quarter, both Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS, the nation's
fourth largest, added fewer subscribers than Wall Street expected,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Sprint, based in Kansas City, said it is slashing 9% of its
wireless work force after a survey showed that 30% more of its
customers are using its automated services rather than live
operators, said spokeswoman Stephanie Walsh. It was unclear, though,
how much of that might have come from 1.1 million new customers added
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The reduction in Orange County will leave only 600 Sprint wireless
sales, marketing, personnel and finance employees in Irvine and
elsewhere in the county, Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the company's Irvine office will be vacated when the
center closes June 28. Employees to be dismissed will receive
severance, career counseling and opportunities at job fairs to get
other employment, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine operation, the only one in Southern California, is the
largest of the call centers to be closed and the most expensive to
operate, Walsh said. Others to be closed are in Atlanta; Lawrence,
Kan.; and the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tallahassee.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts are expected to save Sprint $60 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh said the five facilities are the smallest of the company's
call centers and need the most upgrading, an issue facing the whole
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Just as subscriber growth wanes, wireless carriers also must
contend with the expense of upgrading their networks to provide
advanced services, such as wireless high-speed Internet access, and
to expand capacity so networks can handle more calls. Meantime,
competition among the six national carriers has pushed down calling
prices and increased marketing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Sprint, Verizon Wireless is not laying off anyone dealing
with customers, said spokesman Jim Gerace. Verizon Wireless, a joint
venture of Verizon Communications and Britain's Vodafone Group, will
fire legal, finance, marketing and other administrative employees, he
said. The layoffs will be spread out across the nation among the
company's 40,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint PCS shares fell 93 cents to close at $9.27, and Verizon
Communications rose 7 cents to $45.61; both trade on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stallone Sues Ex-Advisor on Stock Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sylvester Stallone has sued his former business manager, claiming
that his financial advice led the actor to lose as much as $10
million on the stock of Planet Hollywood International Inc., a theme
restaurant chain.</LD>
<LD>   Stallone, who along with fellow Hollywood celebrities Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis helped launch Planet Hollywood in
1996, claims Kenneth Starr of Starr &amp; Co. dissuaded him from selling
his 3.9 million shares when the stock traded as high as $20 in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" movies claims Starr was biased
because he also advised Keith Barish, a Planet Hollywood board member
and a large shareholder. Stallone said he was unaware that Starr also
advised Barish until last year.</LD>
<TE>   "Starr &amp; Co. did not use their best judgment and undivided loyalty
on behalf of Stallone, but instead used their best judgment and
undivided loyalty on behalf of Starr's other client," according to
the suit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   As Planet Hollywood stock plummeted, Starr advised Stallone to
hold on because his sale would look bad for the company and the stock
was poised to rise, the suit said. Stallone sold his shares for 10
cents apiece, or $295,256, in 2000 after the chain sought Chapter 11
protection.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Starr &amp; Co. could not immediately be reached for
comment.</TE>

<HD>UC Named Lead Plaintiff  in Enron Class-Action Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge chooses university system, which lost $145
million in the collapse, over two other pension fund groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Houston federal judge Friday picked the University of California
over two other groups of public pension funds to be the lead
plaintiff in a massive class-action lawsuit against senior executives
of Enron Corp. and its auditor, Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   Enron's stock collapse cost the university system $145 million in
pension and endowment funds it had invested in the company.</LD>
<LD>   Though that is a tiny fraction of the $54 billion of pension and
endowment funds held by the university system, the organization has
taken an aggressive role in trying to recover the  money, hiring
veteran class-action law firm  Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp;
Lerach.</LD>
<TE>   Two other shareholder groups contended for lead-plaintiff status.
One was composed of public pension funds from Florida and New York
City; the other was a four-state consortium composed of Ohio,
Washington, Georgia and Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   "This lawsuit is a rare and extraordinary legal step for the
university, but it is warranted by the extreme and unique
circumstances surrounding Enron's collapse and the damage that
collapse has caused so many," James E. Holst, the university's
general counsel, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston made the ruling
Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The university said she based her decision on several factors,
including the "UC's ability as a single investor to coordinate the
litigation." The other plaintiffs are made up of groups of investors.</TE>
<TE>   As the lead plaintiff, the university system will take on the
primary role of managing the case and monitoring developments for
other plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The case is expected to take several years to litigate.</TE>
<TE>   The university joined the lawsuit in December, claiming that it
was duped by a "massive insider trading" scheme in which the company
and Andersen accounting firm issued false financial statements and
made "false and misleading statements about the company's purportedly
record results and strong operating performance."</TE>
<TE>   The university at one point owned 2.2 million Enron shares.
CalPERS, the state public employees retirement system, said it has
lost $45 million in Enron shares. The California State Teachers
Retirement System lost about $40 million.</TE>

<HD>Man Accused of Illegally Selling Cadaver Parts</HD>
<DH>Crime: Riverside County mortuary owner is jailed on charges
of mutilation of human remains and embezzlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside County funeral home owner with a history of financial
trouble has been jailed for allegedly selling to research
institutions the body parts of cadavers, many of them indigents.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest Thursday of Michael Francis Brown, 42, follows a
yearlong investigation by the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.
He has been charged with 156 felony counts of unlawful mutilation of
human remains and embezzlement.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Gorham said Brown made $400,000 in a year
illegally selling body parts to institutions such as the University
of Kentucky, the University of Utah and East Carolina University,
which use them in anatomy, embalming and medical school classes. The
institutions thought they were buying body parts and cadavers
legitimately, sheriff's Sgt. Shelley Kennedy-Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   Brown was held at Riverside County Jail on $400,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones at the mortuary were answered by a service Friday.
Brown's attorney, Rick Layon, said Brown was innocent and blamed the
arrest on a disgruntled employee.</TE>
<TE>   Gorham confirmed the investigation began on a tip from one of
Brown's former employees. Kennedy-Smith said this was the first such
case in Riverside County. If convicted, Brown could face 100 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We've received numerous phone calls today from people wondering
if their next of kin was involved,'' the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown owns Pacific Family Funeral Home, Pacific Cremation Care and
Bio-Tech Anatomical, all at the same address in Lake Elsinore.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Bio-Tech was established in 2000 to handle
"willed bodies," cadavers legitimately donated to science. Bio-Tech
was allowed to send body parts to universities or companies for
research.</TE>
<TE>   Brown also had a contract with Riverside County to bury and
cremate those too poor to pay for burials. He entered into the first
contract April 1, 1998. The contract was terminated when the county
became aware of the investigation in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators searched Brown's business and his former
and current homes in March 2001. They carted away boxes of business
records, along with dozens of body parts, Gorham said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have identified the remains of 39 people. At least 10
were indigents. Gorham said she could not rule out that Brown's
businesses had handled all cadavers in a similar way.</TE>
<TE>   Brown does not hold a state license as a funeral director or an
embalmer. He does hold licenses with the state Cemetery and Funeral
Bureau to operate Pacific Crematorium and Pacific Cremation Care Inc.</TE>
<TE>   He also had held a business license for Pacific Family Home and
Cremation. Records with the state Cemetery and Funeral Bureau show
the business was fined $2,500 for four minor violations after an
inspection in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Brown fixed the problems, but because he has not paid the fine,
the business' license expired in November.</TE>
<TE>   Records show federal and county tax judgments of $23,252 filed
against Pacific Crematorium, along with a civil judgment of $9,934.</TE>
<TE>   Records also show that Brown and his wife, Victoria, filed for
protection under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy law in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's arrest is the latest scandal to emerge from willed body
programs in recent years. The head of UC Irvine's program,
Christopher Brown, was fired in 1999 after an audit found alleged
wrongdoing. Christopher Brown and Michael Brown are apparently
unrelated, Gorham said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually in the UCI case, it was revealed that at least two
donated cadavers were used without university permission in a private
anatomy class in the Willed Body morgue, and families may have
received the wrong remains or been improperly billed for the return
of their relatives' ashes.</TE>
<TE>   A UCI audit uncovered hundreds of dollars of overcharges made to a
company that transported cadavers. A business associate of
Christopher Brown's owned the company.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were filed in the case.</TE>

<HD>Parks Was Praised in 2 Confidential Reports</HD>
<DH>LAPD: But second Police Commission evaluation also faulted
him on morale, Rampart scandal and other issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT and JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks received strong praise for
his leadership qualities in confidential Police Commission reports
evaluating his first 31/2 years on the job, but was also taken to
task on some of the same fronts that Mayor James K. Hahn now
identifies in arguing that he should not be reappointed.</LD>
<LD>   In the years covered by the evaluations, obtained by The Times,
commissioners found much to admire about Parks' vision and
administration of the LAPD, from his commitment to discipline to his
handling of security for the 2000 Democratic National Convention. The
chief, commissioners wrote, also "exceeds goals and expectations."</LD>
<LD>   But the second of the two evaluations, in particular, suggests
that the relationship between Parks and his civilian bosses was
becoming somewhat strained. Specifically, it shows the commissioners
voicing concern about the chief's approach to civilian oversight,
community policing and officer morale, issues that Hahn also has
raised.</LD>
<TE>   "Repeated public statements that either there is not a morale
problem or that it is not his concern have not reflected well on his
leadership," the commission wrote in the latter evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' chances for reappointment to a second five-year term as
chief have been made more difficult by Hahn's recent statements that
he should step down. The five-member civilian Police Commission,
whose current members were appointed by Hahn but are empowered to
make an independent decision, will decide Parks' fate in coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The two evaluations were drafted by commission members appointed
by former Mayor Richard Riordan, a staunch supporter of the chief. A
review for 2001 has not yet been completed.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear what weight the reviews will be given in the
reappointment process by the current panel, which contains only one
holdover member. Commission members have said they will develop
specific criteria on which to evaluate the chief in coming days and
will then decide his future.</TE>
<TE>   The chief's first evaluation, dated June 1999, addressed his early
tenure in the post he assumed in August 1997 and was highly
complimentary of his efforts to toughen the discipline system,
streamline the command structure and return community police
liaisons, known as senior lead officers, to patrol.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief has directed and harnessed the talent in the
department, encouraged employees to take leadership approaches to
their work, raised the bar of excellence, made it clear that
performance and accountability are applied to each employee, and
imposed meaningful discipline and training," the commission stated in
the initial review. "First year has been fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Los Angeles' crime rate was continuing to drop and most
city leaders agreed that Parks' strong leadership was a marked
improvement over the stewardship of his predecessor, Willie L.
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   In the evaluation, Parks came across as an extremely active and
involved leader who took a personal role in a wide range of
operational decisions. He was called a "hands on" manager who went
through the department's budget line by line, checked weekly on
overtime costs, and involved himself in everything from departmental
litigation to where officers are allowed to park their cars.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners praised him for adept administration and his
efforts to diversify the LAPD by fostering relationships with gay
community groups, clergy and businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this first evaluation also shows that early on, commissioners
did have concerns about Parks' interactions with the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Sought Better Communication</TE>
<TE>   For example, in that first report the commissioners told Parks he
should strive to communicate more effectively with the mayor and City
Council. The document also said he should consult with the commission
in a timely way, and "before making major policy decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Other comments in the report highlighted some of the chief's
idiosyncrasies--for instance, his occasional stiffness in public,
portrayed by some as coldness.</TE>
<TE>   People close to Parks argue that his public demeanor contrasts
strikingly with a warmer private manner; the early evaluation
suggested that commissioners thought so too.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' "formal speeches are sometimes long, delivered in a
monotone and with little eye contact," the commissioners wrote,
"while his extemporaneous remarks are animated, articulate and even
humorous."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the evaluation called on the chief to demonstrate "more
empathy and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   The second evaluation, dated February 2001, covers a much more
turbulent time for Parks and the department. This period, from June
1999 to December 2000, was dominated by the Rampart corruption
scandal and a deepening rift between the chief and the LAPD officers'
union over discipline and the union's efforts to win approval for a
flexible work schedule.</TE>
<TE>   It was a time when Parks was involved in a high-profile squabble
with then-Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti over the LAPD's alleged refusal to
turn over information about the scandal. Parks also battled with the
commission's inspector general over access to department records.</TE>
<TE>   And there was a change in the commission leadership, which altered
the dynamics of Parks' relationship with his five civilian bosses. In
Parks' first years on the job, the commission president was attorney
Edith Perez, a strong ally of the chief who as a commissioner
recommended his appointment to Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Perez's unabashed support of Parks, however, caused some civil
rights advocates and city leaders to question her ability to provide
effective civilian oversight of the department. When her commission
term expired in 1999, Riordan decided not to reappoint her to the
board.</TE>
<TE>   End of the 'Honeymoon'</TE>
<TE>   After Perez's departure, criminal defense attorney Gerald L.
Chaleff assumed the role of commission president, marking the end of
the chief's "honeymoon" period with his civilian bosses.</TE>
<TE>   While most on the panel were still very supportive of the chief,
the relationship between Parks and Chaleff, which was never good,
worsened.</TE>
<TE>   The second evaluation reflected this. More critical of Parks, it
was debated by the commission for many months.</TE>
<TE>   By the time it was completed, Riordan had removed Chaleff from the
panel. So the task of signing the chief's review fell to the new
president, Raquelle de la Rocha. She was generally supportive of the
chief but also sometimes took him to task.</TE>
<TE>   More Kudos Than Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the second evaluation was still positive. Often, the
board's concerns were expressed after the commissioners had
complimented him in one way or another.</TE>
<TE>   For example, while they praised the chief's initial handling of
the Rampart scandal and his decision to conduct a thorough
self-critique of the department's administrative failings, they
criticized him for not consulting with them first about his plans.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been several key instances where decisions were
announced and/or implemented without meaningful input from the board
and, in some instances, without consultation or advance notice."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners also said the department's response to their
requests for action or information "has been on several occasions
untimely."</TE>
<TE>   The panel chided Parks for his public feud with Garcetti. At the
time of the flare-up, the commission ordered Parks to cooperate with
county prosecutors in the corruption probe and directed the inspector
general to investigate the chief's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Inspector General Jeffrey C. Eglash concluded that
Parks had sought to bypass county prosecutors handling the Rampart
investigation and, at a minimum, "the weight of the evidence
establishes that Chief Parks made misleading statements" about his
actions.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the commissioners sided with Parks in a 3-2 vote,
ruling that he did not commit misconduct. Nonetheless, they expressed
their displeasure about the incident in his review.</TE>
<TE>   Eglash and Parks have clashed on several other occasions over the
years, most often over the inspector general's access to department
records. This too was noted in Parks' most recent review.</TE>
<TE>   "More progress is needed from the chief in forging a better
working relationship with the inspector general," it said.</TE>
<TE>   But the second evaluation also showed that the commission's
priorities shifted over time. In fact, in several instances, the
commissioners found fault with Parks for the very stands that won him
praise the first time around.</TE>
<TE>   Changing Views on Discipline</TE>
<TE>   In the first report, the commission strongly endorsed his
disciplinary reforms, commenting: "a strong disciplinarian, which is
what we need. Well done."</TE>
<TE>   But in the following evaluation, the commissioners were more
ambivalent. Although they still supported Parks' views, they told him
he needed to "ensure that discipline is imposed fairly and that it is
perceived to be fair," and they noted that many officers believed it
was not.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be a better balance between the stick [discipline]
and the carrot," they said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners also shifted their stance on Parks' community
policing efforts.</TE>
<TE>   In the early report, the commission referred to his controversial
decision to replace an outreach program consisting of specialized
senior lead officers as the realization of one of their goals. They
endorsed Parks' alternative plan, which was to make community
policing the responsibility of all patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   But by the second evaluation--after this change had generated a
political and community backlash--commissioners endorsed the
reinstatement of senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they told Parks that he must "overcome the impression
he is not enthusiastic about the SLO program." Moreover, they wrote
that many community groups "feel the department's commitment to
community policing is wanting."</TE>
<TE>   In the second report, commissioners also told Parks that he needed
to focus his attention on matters of morale and police attrition.
They acknowledged that some causes of those problems, such as an
antagonistic union, were "well beyond the control of the chief.
However, we believe that there are constructive steps the chief can
and must take to improve morale," they wrote. "As stated before, the
chief must recognize that officer morale is his responsibility."</TE>

<HD>Bowers Showing Rare Gems</HD>
<DH>Jewels: Former Apple Computer president displays part of
his vast collection for the first time to the public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First to go was the 60-carat tanzanite.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a rare 36-carat tsavorite garnet, sparkling like an emerald.
Later, the serpentine tiara with a 242-carat tanzanite.</LD>
<LD>   One gorgeous stone after another was vanishing from the market
during the 1980s, but no one could figure out which aficionado, under
the alias "White Rose," was behind the buys.</LD>
<TE>   "A few isolated murmurings began to quietly pass among those in
the collecting community that 'something big' was happening in the
gem world as important stone after important stone disappeared from
the market," said Joel Bartsch, curator of gems and minerals at the
Houston Museum of Natural Science.</TE>
<TE>   It's natural enough that no one thought to look at Michael M.
Scott, lifelong computer devotee, adopter of stray cats, a man who
never even wore rings during his career. But after leaving his job as
the first president of Apple Computer in 1981, Scott entered the
world of jewelry with a passion, putting together a gemstone
collection that experts say rivals the holdings of royalty. Unlike
most royalty, he has his own gemology lab.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of Scott's collection will go on public display for the
first time today at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "The gems he's collected are extremely rare, and they're
impressively large examples," said Elise B. Misiorowski, director of
the Carlsbad-based Gemological Institute of America.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's collection is noted for its rainbow range of colors and
the rarity of the stones, including black, pink and yellow diamonds,
red emeralds and pinkish-orange sapphires.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of this glittering trove is a quiet, 59-year-old
bachelor, who lives on five acres in Los Altos with four cats. He
sees the humor in his story line: computer exec turned obsessive
collector.</TE>
<TE>   Scott first made waves at Apple Computer when he helped launched
the Apple II personal computer and took the company public in 1980.
After clashing with founder Steve Jobs, he left the next year with
tens of millions of dollars worth of company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen years ago, he shook off decades of habit to start buying
his stones. Jewelry was frowned on in the computer world. In fact,
wearing jewelry near the computers was banned when he took his first
college-level computer class at age 13.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you were told was that you absolutely couldn't
wear any rings. Never wear rings," said Scott, recalling the days
when data was fed into computers by punch card. If an operator was
wearing a ring that made a dent on the card, the machine could jam,
he said. "That stayed with me."</TE>
<TE>   "After I left Apple in 1981, I was trying not to be a Type A
personality anymore and realized I could have a piece of jewelry
now," he said. "There are no punch cards around anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Scott usually rotates portions of his collection among various
banks. The stones are the easiest way to turn wealth into beauty, he
said. He thinks each stone touches the viewer in a different way.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll find your hand always shakes a little bit," he said during
the show's setup two weeks ago, as he gently lifted the 9-ounce
white-gold tiara set with the massive tanzanite, a deep-blue stone
found in Africa. The gem in the tiara is largest of its kind and is
surrounded by hundreds of tiny diamonds and light-green tsavorite
garnets from Africa. It is the centerpiece of the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's gemstones, shown in 125 groupings for the Bowers' "Gems!
The Art and Nature of Precious Stones," include the world's largest
known faceted gemstone: a 220-pound sculpted quartz crystal.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael is a unique collector in his ... determination to get the
rough and cut examples of virtually every gem species of exceptional
size and color," Misiorowski said. "He's amassed the most amazing gem
collection I've ever heard about."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's collection also features a necklace with the world's two
largest benitoites--bluish-violet gems found only in a small area of
San Benito County. Jeffrey Post , curator of the Smithsonian's
collection of more than 10,000 gems, met Scott several years ago. He
said of the Bowers show, "This is the first public exhibition in a
museum where a major portion of his collection is going to be on
exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   Scott has shown his gems at private gatherings in Germany, Seattle
and Los Angeles. He searched for six years for a museum that would
agree to show the breadth of his collection and give him creative
freedom. He was introduced to Bowers President Peter C. Keller by gem
photographer Erica Van Pelt, who had worked with both men. Keller, a
gemologist with a doctorate in geology from the University of Texas
at Austin, is curating the show.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit has three parts: an introduction to gemology; a
display of colored stones in a wide range of sizes; and gems
incorporated into jewelry and sculpture, such as a 10-carat Burmese
"pigeon's blood" ruby in an antique ring and a 64-carat royal-blue
Sri Lankan sapphire set in a golden cobra, and raw uncut stones.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said the pieces he's showing at the Bowers--a fifth of his
collection--are worth about $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Narrowly Avoided an Expensive Mistake</TE>
<TE>   He started during the 1980s with a stone that he thought was a
7-carat tsavorite. When he insisted on proof of the gem's quality, he
learned that he had nearly been duped into buying an artificial
stone. He found another 7-carat tsavorite, a real one this time. But,
determined not to be misled again, he delved into gemology, becoming
an expert on minerals and building a gem lab. In his early collecting
days, he traveled the world to make his purchases. Buyers and dealers
now come to him.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-carat tsavorite, one of Scott's most treasured pieces, is in
the Bowers show.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the nice things about it is that everyone thinks it's an
emerald," Scott said. "And that's part of the reason for the show.
People just think reds are for rubies, blues are for sapphires,
greens are for emeralds. But there's so much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of why I collect and show is because it's fun, whereas some
collectors just hoard and keep it to themselves. I want to show the
stones for others to enjoy and to see all this natural beauty that
Earth creates herself."</TE>

<HD>2 African American Islamic Leaders Vow to Join Forces</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Islam's two preeminent African American leaders, separated by two
decades of rivalry before reconciling two years ago, reaffirmed unity
Friday in their first joint appearance in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and W.D. Muhammad of the
Muslim American Society offered stark contrasts--one a fiery orator
of political polemics and black empowerment; the other a low-key
leader who resolutely sticks to religion. Once united under Nation of
Islam founder Elijah Muhammad, they split 25 years ago over doctrine,
with W.D. Muhammad rejecting his father's blend of Islam and black
nationalism and moving into orthodox Sunni Islam.</LD>
<LD>   The two men, who together command the nation's single largest
group of Muslims--African Americans--vowed Friday to join forces to
build up the black community. Creating an Islamic movement in
pluralistic America could be a global model, they said as they kicked
off the Nation of Islam's Saviour's Day convention.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to stick with Minister Farrakhan all the way to the
promised land," said Muhammad as he led Friday prayer before
thousands of Muslims at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   For Farrakhan, 69, the appearance with Muhammad reinforced the
conciliatory theme he has struck all week: Wednesday and Thursday, he
urged peace among gang members in Watts, exhorted hip-hop artists to
sanitize their lyrics and performed a Beethoven violin concerto in
his second public performance in 42 years. The convention offered
several workshops pegged to the theme of healing and
reconciliation--such as one on religion that featured panelists of
Jewish, Christian, Sikh and both Sunni and Shia Islamic backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Farrakhan set the stage for the conciliatory events with the
violin concerto Wednesday, which he said he offered to the public
because music "is a universal language ... with the power to bind."
He likened the orchestra--disparate elements brought together in
harmony for a common musical aim--to the vision he promotes of
bridging racial and religious divides.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics are skeptical that a man long regarded as a
race-baiter and Jew-hater is sincere in his reconciliation efforts.
But among those vouching for him was his Chicago violin teacher,
Elaine Skorodin Fohrman--a Jew whom Farrakhan said he chose in part
to prove his goodwill toward the Jewish people. Fohrman, who
performed with Farrakhan at his concerto in Cerritos, says she
decided to teach him despite his controversial statements about Jews
because of his passion for music and his love of Jewish composers.</TE>
<TE>   "The love of music is what I saw with great passion," Fohrman
said. "I knew certainly he could not have hatred in his heart." She
said she saw a correlation between Farrakhan's decision to return to
the violin a decade ago and a softening of his persona and message.</TE>
<TE>   Farrakhan himself told reporters this week that the Nation of
Islam was evolving, just as a thorn-scarred rose grows into "a
beautiful flower." He said all major religious movements have started
out narrowly and broadened their reach into a universal message, and
that the Nation of Islam was doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in recent months Farrakhan has begun moving into the
universal message of orthodox Islam. He has been aided by Muhammad,
whose followers have helped train Nation of Islam forces in orthodox
practices.</TE>
<TE>   But major theological differences remain. Just as evangelical
Christians view Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses as deviations from
their faith, orthodox Muslims reject the Nation's core beliefs that
Elijah Muhammad was a divine messenger and that his teacher, W. Fard
Muhammad, was God incarnate. Orthodox Muslims reject the idea of
human divinity and believe the prophet Muhammad was God's final
messenger.</TE>
<TE>   The differences have inhibited some orthodox Muslim groups from
supporting Farrakhan, financially and otherwise. But Farrakhan seemed
to hint Friday that he would begin moving his flocks away from those
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Whether his followers can embrace the changes remains to be seen.
"Master Fard was God in the person," insisted Alfonso Muhammad, 37, a
Nation of Islam minister in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Muhammad asserted that Farrakhan did not actually
believe the old Nation doctrines anymore--"He's no fool"--but was
moving carefully so as not to lose his following. Now that Farrakhan
is leaving behind his controversial religious and racial doctrines,
Muhammad said, he is headed toward the status of Malcolm X as one of
the black community's leading consciences.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said the two movements will probably never merge,
however. Farrakhan is "a political figure; [I'm] a religious figure
and that's the way it's going to stay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Farrakhan also brought a message of peace and unity to the first
West Coast hip-hop summit Thursday in Beverly Hills. In a speech
laced with Bible lessons, the Muslim leader exhorted the
standing-room-only crowd of hip-hop heavyweights, gang leaders and
music-industry moguls to clean up their lyrics and use their
international appeal to youth to send out positive messages.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, all little children can't read 'Dick and Jane,' but
they can recite your words," Farrakhan said. "Suppose you started
teaching in your rap knowledge the children need to know--how to
fight racism?"</TE>
<TE>   He told the crowd they had been duped into irrelevant rivalries.
He held up Muhammad Ali as a model of someone willing to sacrifice
wealth for principles. He roared at them not to "whore yourselves for
money," even as he reminded them he was scolding them out of love.</TE>
<TE>   "We love you too!" the audience roared back.</TE>

<DH>Lottery: A $183-million jackpot leads to long lines and
high hopes in Ventura County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is why they call it Lotto fever.</LD>
<LD>   It's high noon Friday, 32 hours before the drawing for
California's record $183-million SuperLotto jackpot, and more than 70
luck-hungry souls are inching single file into the state's winningest
lottery retailer.</LD>
<LD>   The line snakes past the refrigerated section at Allan's Wine &amp;
Lotto in Port Hueneme, past the beef sticks and corn chips and jugs
of pink wine, before spilling onto the sidewalk and moving
dangerously close to the front door of the neighboring 99 Cent Store.</LD>
<TE>   Cash in hand, would-be millionaires have come from all over
Southern California, drawn by the legend of this little liquor store
and its six SuperLotto jackpots.</TE>
<TE>   "Just wait until you see the line tomorrow," said Sue Ann Sanders,
who along with her husband, Glenn, presided over one of the store's
two red-hot ticket dispensing machines. The couple, who have owned
the store for 27 years, figure they will sell more than $100,000 in
tickets before the numbers are drawn.</TE>
<TE>   Coverage in recent days from Los Angeles-area television stations
has only boosted the store's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always busy, but it's been crazy," said Glenn Sanders,
shelling out tickets like a blackjack dealer in a Las Vegas casino.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers across the county reported long lines and brisk sales
for today's drawing, which will occur shortly before 8 p.m. But the
buying frenzy began early, with lottery players pooling their money
and taking extended lunch hours Friday to chase their big-money
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   And judging by the numbers, Ventura County is as good a place as
any to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the top 10 luckiest retailers are in the county. Allan's
has had the most jackpots, while the 7-Eleven on East Channel Islands
Boulevard is ninth on the list with three.</TE>
<TE>   There, store owner Jessie Tiwana said he sold 14,000 tickets
Thursday and was on pace to sell 30,000 Friday. He expected that his
single machine would spit out more than 50,000 tickets by the time
today's drawing took place.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers have come from as far as Long Beach, Tiwana said. Some
touch the floor or clutch his arm for luck as the Lotto machine
chatters and prints out numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's lucky for me, anyway," said Tiwana, who cleared $175,000
when the store sold a winning ticket in March 2000. "I was able to
pay off the store. If we hit one more time, I'm going to retire."</TE>
<TE>   When the payoff is this big, few people come to these Lotto hot
spots in search of soft drinks and snacks. But Tiwana and other
retailers get compensated in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   They earn about 7 cents for each $1 ticket they sell. And they can
earn 0.5%--in this case $915,000--for selling the winning ticket.
Like those who play the game, some retailers figure it's just a
matter of time before good luck comes their way.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have the long lines because I haven't had a big
winner--yet," said Ronald Anthony, owner of Conejo Valley Liquor in
Newbury Park. "But maybe it's our turn next."</TE>
<TE>   It's that kind of optimism that keeps the lines long at Allan's
Wine &amp; Lotto. The front wall is plastered with photos of the six
jackpot winners who bought tickets at the store plus a seventh man
who won $1 million in the lottery's Big Spin game.</TE>
<TE>   After trekking 50 miles from her Brentwood home to Port Hueneme,
Wendy Kohlhoff could use the money. Someone had backed into her car
at an Oxnard intersection just as she was rubbing her good luck
charms, which include a miniature Buddha.</TE>
<TE>   All that aggravation just to buy seven tickets. But she figures if
she hits it big, she can simply replace her now-dented Mazda with a
chrome-colored, four-wheel-drive Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even stand in line this long for Rod Stewart," said
Kohlhoff, a waitress at the Buggy Whip restaurant in Westchester who
plans to give two nights' notice if she wins. "All it takes is one
[winning ticket]."</TE>
<TE>   That said, customers were buying tickets by the bunches Friday,
trying to get the upper hand on SuperLotto's 1-in-41-million odds.
The Sanders said one man bought $850 worth of tickets Friday, and he
wasn't even part of an office pool.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait until [Saturday night] around 6 o'clock, that's when it will
be busiest," Sue Ann Sanders said. "That is when everyone thinks they
are going to get the luckiest tickets."</TE>

<DH>Lottery: Office pools spring up all over as the state's
record jackpot edges past $180 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL and GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Sichta figures there won't be any need to take up an office
collection for her goodbye party. With any luck, the $35 that she
collected Friday will easily cover it.</LD>
<LD>   Sichta organized the office pool at her downtown Los Angeles
architectural firm for today's record-breaking $180-million-plus
California lottery. Like thousands of other groups across the state,
she and six co-workers joined forces in hopes of increasing their
odds of winning the largest single-state jackpot ever in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   "There are only eight of us in the office," said Sichta, a
designer who lives in Sherman Oaks. "The other person decided not to
join in--she's watching her money.</LD>
<TE>   "But of course, she won't have a job if we win," she joked. "We'll
be closing our office."</TE>
<TE>   The take-this-job-and-shove-it attitude was common among those who
spent their lunch breaks at lottery outlets across Los Angeles
County. With a jackpot so big, there is plenty of money to share. So
why not buck the SuperLotto Plus drawing's 1-in-41 million odds by
sharing multiple tickets with co-workers?</TE>
<TE>   In the lotto line at the "7th &amp; Fig" newsstand between two
Figueroa Street high-rises, owner Sanjay Khetani caught the fever. He
formed a pool of his own for those without office colleagues. "I have
21 people who put in $20 each. And we rolled over $83 we won in
Wednesday's drawing," Khetani said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance company operations manager Paul Williamson of Downey had
$190 collected from 35 co-workers in his 48th-floor office. "Being in
the business we're in, we know how to figure the odds. The odds
stink," Williams said. "About half the people in our office are in
the pool. Some secretaries put in two bucks. The executives put in
$20."</TE>
<TE>   SuperLotto officials do the math and divvy up the amounts that
winning office pool participants are entitled to for groups up to 100
people, said state lottery spokeswoman Norma Minas.</TE>
<TE>   More than two-thirds of California's big jackpots have been won by
groups. So far, Minas said, the state has avoided the kinds of
squabbles between office pool participants that have sparked legal
fights elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   California lotto players are so mellow, in fact, that Los Angeles
coffeehouse manager Mary Ann Champaine kicked in the cash so several
of her workers were certain to be included when she purchased the
winning $87-million SuperLotto Plus jackpot ticket in October 2000.
Thanks to her generosity, all 13 of her workers won $6,692,307 each.</TE>
<TE>   Things do not always go that smoothly with office pools outside
California, however.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 14 taxi drivers in Atlanta tried to claim a share of a
$90-million lottery ticket, claiming they were part of a pool
organized by 37 other cabbies at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport. In Maine, four co-workers sought a share of a $295-million
multi-state Powerball jackpot won by a ticket they suspected was
purchased as part of their office pool.</TE>
<TE>   Minas said those conducting office pools are encouraged to make a
list of all participants and give photocopies of it--along with
photocopies of the lottery tickets purchased by the group--to
everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles health-care billing company worker Kimberly Daniels
said her friends go even further.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a contract we all sign with the names and lottery numbers
listed. Our department manager keeps the tickets," Daniels said.
Legal secretary Sheila Sanders said she planned to personally pay for
photocopies of the $60 worth of lottery tickets she purchased Friday
for her dozen-member office pool. That way there is no conflict with
her law firm over the winnings that Sanders, of Long Beach, was
confident are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cleaning out my desk tonight," she joked. "We've already told
the firm we're not coming in Monday."</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't the only one.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, car lot sales manager Mike Brown was
laughing at the odds but not at the $10 he and 10 other co-workers
invested in their lottery pool. "The only people who think they'll
win with a pool are people who can't do math," the Woodland Hills man
said. Nonetheless, Brown pledged that he "wouldn't be like the guy
that wins a billion dollars and keeps working screwing light bulbs"
if they win.</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby escrow office, Joe Caprio joined a pool with 19 other
people to purchase 117 tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't take it too seriously," said Caprio, of Woodland Hills.
"But I join just in case. You'll feel left out and you'd be mad at
yourself for making a huge mistake."</TE>

<HD>Workers Unite in Hopes of Big Payday</HD>
<DH>Lottery: Office pools spring up all over in attempt to
better the odds as record jackpot edges past $180 million.</DH>

<LD>Kim Sichta figures there won't be any need to take up an office
collection for her goodbye party. With any luck, the $35 that she
collected Friday will easily cover it.</LD>
<LD>   Sichta organized the office pool at her architectural firm for
today's record-breaking $180-million-plus California lottery. Like
thousands of groups across the state, she and six Los Angeles
co-workers joined forces in hopes of increasing their odds of winning
the largest single-state jackpot in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "There are only eight of us in the office," said Sichta, a
designer who lives in Sherman Oaks. "The other person decided not to
join in--she's watching her money.</LD>
<TE>   "But of course, she won't have a job if we win," she joked. "We'll
be closing our office."</TE>
<TE>   The take-this-job-and-shove-it attitude was common among those who
spent their lunch breaks at lottery outlets across Southern
California. With a jackpot so big, there is plenty of money to share.
So why not buck the SuperLotto Plus drawing's 1-in-41 million odds by
sharing multiple tickets with co-workers?</TE>
<TE>   At the Kap-N-Keg Mini Market in Costa Mesa, customer Meredith
Mateer said she usually doesn't play Lotto, but the lure of a
$200-million jackpot was too much to resist. The Costa Mesa resident,
who bought five tickets, said she would quit her job if she won, then
go to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Clerk Dennis Connell said the store sold nearly 7,000 tickets
during his shift. ''Everybody's talking about it. Hey, you have to
try,'' said Connell, who bought about 40 tickets.</TE>
<TE>   In the lotto line at the "7th &amp; Fig" newsstand between two
Figueroa Street high-rises, owner Sanjay Khetani caught the fever. He
formed a pool of his own for those without office colleagues. "I have
21 people who put in $20 each. And we rolled over $83 we won in
Wednesday's drawing," Khetani said.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance company operations manager Paul Williamson of Downey had
$190 collected from 35 co-workers in his 48th-floor office. "Being in
the business we're in, we know how to figure the odds. The odds
stink," Williams said. "About half the people in our office are in
the pool. Some secretaries put in two bucks. The executives put in
$20."</TE>
<TE>   SuperLotto officials do the math and divvy up the amounts that
winning office pool participants are entitled to for groups up to 100
people, said state lottery spokeswoman Norma Minas.</TE>
<TE>   More than two-thirds of California's big jackpots have been won by
groups. So far, Minas said, the state has avoided the kinds of
squabbles between office pool participants that have sparked legal
fights elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   California lotto players are so mellow, in fact, that Los Angeles
coffeehouse manager Mary Ann Champaine kicked in the cash so several
of her workers were certain to be included when she purchased the
winning $87-million SuperLotto Plus jackpot ticket in October 2000.
Thanks to her generosity, all 13 of her workers won $6,692,307 each.</TE>
<TE>   Things do not always go that smoothly with office pools outside
California, however.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 14 taxi drivers in Atlanta tried to claim a share of a
$90-million lottery ticket, claiming they were part of a pool
organized by 37 other cabbies at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport. In Maine, four co-workers sought a share of a $295-million
multistate Powerball jackpot won by a ticket they suspected was
purchased as part of their office pool.</TE>
<TE>   Minas said those conducting office pools are encouraged to make a
list of all participants and give photocopies of it--along with
photocopies of the lottery tickets purchased by the group--to
everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles health-care billing company worker Kimberly Daniels
said her friends go even further.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a contract we all sign with the names and lottery numbers
listed. Our department manager keeps the tickets," said Daniels of
South Central Los Angeles. Legal secretary Sheila Sanders said she
planned to pay for photocopies of the $60 worth of lottery tickets
she purchased Friday for her dozen-member office pool. That way there
is no conflict with her law firm over the winnings that Sanders, of
Long Beach, was confident are coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cleaning out my desk tonight," she joked. "We've already told
the firm we're not coming in Monday."</TE>
<TE>   Groups, of course, were not the only hopefuls in Lotto lines
Friday. At a 7-Eleven in Costa Mesa, customer Sarath Keenawinna said
he plays every week, but the excitement increases when the jackpot
gets huge.</TE>
<TE>   ''I really don't know what I would do if I won,'' the Costa Mesa
resident said. ''It's a lot of money.''</TE>
<TE>   At a gas station in Irvine, employee Sheila Ruegas reported
selling more than 1,000 tickets to customers who streamed in all the
day, some buying scores of Lotto tickets.</TE>
<TE>   As for Ruegas, ''I bought just one,'' she said.</TE>

<HD>Course Gives Kids Drive to Play Golf</HD>
<DH>A special city program links children to affordable lessons
at Griffith Park. They can even earn free clubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anjelica Lopez is a 10-year-old standout at the Tregnan Golf Academy
for Kids. Asked why she wants to learn golf, she's the only one of
her classmates who mentions her future--50 years from now.</LD>
<LD>   "Golf will be good to know," the fourth-grader explains, "because
I can still do it when I'm old."</LD>
<LD>   Such accidental comedy is routine on the three-hole golf course at
Griffith Park--a golf course strictly for kids.</LD>
<TE>   "Adults," a clubhouse sign warns, "must be accompanied at all
times by a child."</TE>
<TE>   About 2,750 youths from throughout L.A. have attended the 10-week
group lessons at the park north of downtown since Tregnan opened in
July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Tregnan's executive director, Randy Kelly, said classes fill up
fast. This winter's sessions are sold out. Spring registration begins
in March.</TE>
<TE>   The class offers 15 hours of instruction for $25. The going rate
for children's lessons at the park's other three courses is 12 hours
for $99. Prices are much higher at municipal courses, and higher
still at privately owned courses. Private lessons for a child run
about $80 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   On this blustery Wednesday, the 90-minute class begins at 4 p.m.
The wind is so cold on this slope above the pony rides that the
students will spend only 40 minutes outside.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying their clubs out of the clubhouse, most of the 39 kids
head for the driving range. It is the third week of class, so the
children need to concentrate first on their swings, and whacking a
bucket of balls is a lot more fun at this stage than putting and
missing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to play in these conditions, Rick!" student William Lee
shouts over the wind, bracing himself to swing his driver into the
gusts.</TE>
<TE>   "Good," the teacher hollers back. "You'll just have to play that
much better."</TE>
<TE>   The classes are open to children ages 7 to 17. Most of the
students are 9 and 10 years old.</TE>
<TE>   One boy, Joseph Park, is the rare 7-year-old whose ball soars at
least as straight and far as those of the teenagers in the class.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very good. For his age and his size? Oh yeah, it's rare,"
says his instructor Nolan Wilson.  He thinks Joseph's swing still
needs work.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to look good, too," he says with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 40% of the students are girls, an excellent showing
considering that only 10% of golfers in the U.S. are women, according
to Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dedicated is Dana Szyka, 15, wearing her school
uniform--a skirt and sweater--from the all-girls Notre Dame Academy
in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her parents' urging her to skip golf because of the cold,
she insisted on coming and merrily swings at ball after ball.</TE>
<TE>   Less devoted today is a little girl named Claire Choo, who is
wearing a quilted coat that resembles a sleeping bag with sleeves.
She hardly swings a club, preferring to chat with the instructor.
"What's your favorite color? I like black, white, lavender and
purple," she says, narrowing things down.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, 10-year-old Kevin Kim offers advice to his cousin.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Andrew, try to hit it here," he says, holding up the
flattened side of his driver, "cause it's the sweet spot," he adds
earnestly. "No, really, it is."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Kim, 9, has a go at it, but his cousin is shaking his head.
"You didn't hit it with the sweet spot. That's the whole problem."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the mechanics of the game, students learn golf etiquette.
Instructors say that the lessons in personal conduct apply off the
links as well.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can teach a child golf, you can teach a child anything,"
said instructor Rick Jitchaku, 40, as he observed the swings of his
six students at the driving range.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf is a game of honesty and integrity, so you have to have a
respect for rules. Those are good life skills."</TE>
<TE>   It is a sport without officials who enforce rules and penalties,
Jitchaku points out. Individuals are expected to call their own
infractions, which can add strokes to their final score.</TE>
<TE>   Do kids struggle with wanting to win more than wanting to play
fair?</TE>
<TE>   "At first, yeah," he says with a grin. "Nobody else really asks
them to do that. The kids will say, 'well, if nobody saw it, it
doesn't count.' But they learn that they don't want somebody else to
cheat. They have a sense of accountability."</TE>
<TE>   At the Tregnan Academy, 75% of openings are reserved for students
from low-income families who otherwise couldn't afford lessons, clubs
and greens fees. Those families can't transport the children across
town to the park.</TE>
<TE>   City vans pick up and return the children to 18 city recreation
centers, 15 of them in "inner-city neighborhoods," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Operation costs of Tregnan are covered by several sources. The
nonprofit Urban Youth Golf Program provides instructors such as
Jitchaku. Federal Community Development Block Grants cover the fees
for kids who can't afford them.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the program budget comes from the Griffith Park Trust
and the U.S. Golf Assn., the nonprofit governing body for competitive
golf.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Recreation and Parks Department, which runs the
Academy, will eventually need to find its own funding, Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   At 4:40 p.m., the students retreat into the clubhouse for a video
lesson in golf manners called "The Spirit of the Game." The children
remain attentive, thanks to frequent pauses by Paula Olsen, Tregnan's
director of instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "So what have you learned so far?" she asks the group. Hands fly
up. Be honest. Treat the course well. Be prepared to play. Don't be
late. Stay quiet so as not to distract other players trying to
concentrate. Oh, and be mindful of the dress code.</TE>
<TE>   Once students achieve a certain level of skill, they are given
their first three clubs--a putter and two irons--and as their skill
increases, so do their free clubs. Once they can show they know the
rules and demonstrate some proficiency, the students can be certified
to play on any city golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Tregnan's course offers open play six days a week for youths;
Sundays are reserved for parent-child golf lessons.</TE>

<HD>Water Report Favors Growth</HD>
<DH>Study: Developers and activists disagree on the MWD's
conclusion that Southland has sufficient supplies for 20 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move hailed by builders but decried by slow-growth advocates,
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has concluded
that the region has enough water to accommodate expected growth in
the next two decades.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released this week, was prompted by new laws requiring
that an assured water supply be available before large-scale
subdivisions are approved by local governments. The water district's
conclusion, however, is based on a number of assumptions that others
dispute--for example, that Southern California will continue to get
surplus water from the Colorado River for at least the next 15 years.</LD>
<LD>   Other states that depend on the Colorado have made it clear that
they won't allow California to continue drawing water at the present
rate indefinitely.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Zimmer, vice president of the Valencia-based Newhall Ranch
and Farming Co., developer of Newhall Ranch, the largest residential
project in Los Angeles County history, said the report will not end
the political fights over growth in Southern California. On the other
hand, Zimmer said, the report may take away water as "a trump card"
for advocates of slow growth.</TE>
<TE>   The largest wholesale supplier of water in the nation, the MWD
serves a 5,200-square-mile area with 17 million residents that
stretches from Oxnard to the border of Mexico and from the coast to
the Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Don Kendall, general manager of the Calleguas Municipal Water
District in Ventura County, said he plans to meet soon with
developers to discuss the MWD report. Large developments are pending
in Simi Valley and Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   "The development community has been coming to us and asking
whether there is water sufficiency," Kendall said. "This report goes
a long way toward proving that there is water to help us meet our
housing needs."</TE>
<TE>   But Elden Hughes, an official with the Sierra Club, said the water
district's optimistic predictions are based on projects that are
environmentally damaging, including one that would remove water from
an aquifer beneath the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't bet your future on the dead bodies of endangered
species," Hughes said.</TE>
<TE>   And Daniel Patterson, a biologist with the Tucson-based Center for
Biological Diversity, said that MWD, in banking on a proposed sale of
water from Imperial County to San Diego, wants to "shift water from
alfalfa to urban sprawl."</TE>
<TE>   MWD Chief Executive Ron Gastelum said the agency is not trying to
influence local land-use decisions. But, he added, "For us to deny
that there is water denies our mandate," under state law, to provide
water for local water agencies to supplement their own supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The report says that programs to conserve water and acquire new
sources of water provide "a very high degree of reliability" that the
water supply will be bolstered at least a decade in advance of
increased demand.</TE>
<TE>   And if all the proposed water projects by the district and local
agencies come to fruition, reliability of water "could be assured
beyond 20 years," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Randele Kanouse, a lobbyist for the East Bay Municipal Utility
District in Northern California, who waged a 10-year battle to win
passage of bills tying growth to water supplies, said he has not yet
studied the MWD report and cannot comment on its methodology.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to death if they can show that there is water
available before homes are constructed," Kanouse said. "The effort of
this legislation was never to shut down growth but to encourage an
honest discussion about water and the likelihood of supplies being
adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Law Resulted From Development Battle</TE>
<TE>   Kanouse said that planning reviews of housing projects often
contained only a few sentences on water supplies. "Those kinds of
reviews were total frauds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD had remained neutral on bills written by Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica) and Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno) that require assurance
of water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The bills were opposed by the Assn. of California Water Agencies,
which represents 435 farming and urban water districts, for fear that
water agencies would be unfairly thrust into the middle of growth
controversies.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was an outgrowth of the battle over the Newhall
Ranch project, a proposed 21,600-home subdivision just east of
Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, in a decision with few precedents, a Superior Court
judge voided the county's approval of the project because planners
had not adequately studied whether the county had enough water for
the projected 70,000 new residents.</TE>
<TE>   The project was sent back to the county Planning Commission for
review.</TE>
<TE>   It is now snared in a legal dispute involving the Castaic Lake
Water Agency's rights to 41,000 acre-feet of water from Kern County.
The Newhall Ranch site is outside the MWD service area.</TE>
<TE>   Industry Official Calls Study Helpful</TE>
<TE>   The Newhall Ranch battle--and a similar fight over an 11,000-home
development in Contra Costa County--helped galvanize support for the
Costa and Kuehl bills. Gov. Gray Davis signed the legislation at the
end of last year's session.</TE>
<TE>   Steve LaMarr, Orange County-based chairman of the water resources
task force for the statewide Building Industry Assn., praised the MWD
study and said he hopes local water agencies do their own studies to
dispel the notion that the region lacks water for growth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very helpful for us," LaMarr said. "We want people to
look at the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the
report's assumptions are faulty.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is very premature," Patterson said. "The [San
Diego-Imperial Valley deal] is far from being finalized and is going
to be challenged."</TE>

<HD>Looking to Old Cathedrals for Inspiration to Beautify

<DH>"UGLY AS SIN: Why They Changed Our Churches from Sacred
Places to Meeting Places--and How We Can Change Them Back Again"
Michael S. Rose, Sophia Press, $24.95, 242 pages</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY OREN</AU>
<BD>Emily Oren is a freelance writer studying classical
civilizations at the Catholic University of America.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's one thing I learned in architecture school: You don't
appropriate someone else's work, or even their style or method. You
respond to it. The architecture must respond too, to the context in
which it is built. A Gothic cathedral next to a modern office
complex, for example, might seem just as ridiculous as a proposed
addition of a glorified accordion-with-glass-enclosure to the
Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.</LD>
<LD>   Michael S. Rose went to architecture school too. His book, "Ugly
as Sin: Why They Changed Our Churches from Sacred Places to Meeting
Spaces--and How We Can Change Them Back Again," offers a useful index
of architectural elements and their spiritual significance. Despite
sounding like a book for specialists only, it has a pleasingly
accessible narrative shape and a logical design, making for easy
reference for specialists. Taking the form of a tour through a modern
worship experience, the narrative stops at various points to contrast
the experience of the pilgrim with that of a medieval traveler
nearing Notre Dame in Paris. Each chapter has a title and a humorous
alterna-title: "Why modern architects secularized our churches" or
"Bad theology has done more damage than bad taste."</LD>
<TE>   But Rose doesn't seem to try to reconcile the principles of church
design--what makes a space sacred and worthy of worship--with modern
ideas and forms. Instead, he eulogizes everything before 1900 and
condemns everything after, unless it looks as if it came before.</TE>
<TE>   Through his study of Notre Dame, "arguably the most famous of
Christendom's great cathedral churches," Rose arrives at three basic
characteristics of church architecture: The structure must have
permanence, it must be vertical in some way (directing the eye
upward) and it must be iconographic, containing symbols that bring
the worshiper back to contemplation of spiritual truths. The theme of
symbolism is a constant thread throughout the book; he makes the
argument that lack of iconography is theologically unsound, leading
Catholics to worship "a false god." Indeed, in our culture,
multitasking is applauded, and the establishment of a sacred place is
almost a dead idea for those bent on making things useful. Equally
rejected is the notion of clear physical reminders of the spiritual
realm that surrounds us.</TE>
<TE>   In his rhapsodizing about Notre Dame, however, Rose seems to get
carried away, implying that the ornamental, lush styles of Gothic and
Romanesque are the only ways in which these principles can be
realized. Granted, a lot of modern architecture is uninspiring and
generic, but "common" architecture has always been that way. Maybe
the solution is not to revert to classical styles, but rather to take
the principles so effectively used by those architects and find a way
to use them that reflects postmodern cultural struggles and passions.
The elements he extols--bells, domes, sculpture--could be used in the
context of the clean lines and stripped-down feel of modern
architecture. Perhaps the main problem is our American practicality,
which won't let us spend time, energy and money toward creating a
place dedicated exclusively to worship when we have so many other
things to do.</TE>
<TE>   His descriptions of modern scenarios are realistic and humorous:
His "pilgrim" can't find a parking spot, doesn't know the music,
hates the ugly carpeting and is taken aback by the overall casual
attitudes of everyone around him. One photograph will make readers
laugh out loud because of its austerity--a shot of a "gathering
space" where people chat and drink coffee after Mass. Two-thirds of
the photo is empty floor space; the only decorations are some plants,
probably artificial, clustered in a corner. "It's brightly lit and
often quite barren," the caption says. "People are considered the
furnishings here." But Rose refrains from cynicism, citing social
mores as a large reason for the difference between the experience of
a medieval pilgrim and a modern one.</TE>
<TE>   Rose's observation of modern culture is keen: for instance, the
way in which the equal-armed Greek cross motif has been misused as a
geometric design. Because of its eye-catching symmetry, it has been
used as a logo for skateboarding gear as well as in churches, where
Rose thinks that it is "doubtful that the frequent [nonbelieving]
passerby will be offended by such inconspicuous Christian symbolism."</TE>
<TE>   The last chapter of "Ugly as Sin" is devoted to a number of
before-after stories, including photos of churches that were stripped
bare in the 1960s and recently restored to their original richness.
Rose offers suggestions for how to improve church worship space,
along with references to theological and architectural treatises and
a list of registered, recommended architects. Readers are left with
the encouraging feeling that change is possible for modern church
designs, and, of course, we are the ones responsible for making it
happen.</TE>

<HD>It Sounds Like Hate, but Is It?</HD>
<DH>Most sacred texts contain passages shocking to modern
sensibilities. But experts say they need to be read in context.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This month's flap over whether Korans containing anti-Jewish
commentary should be pulled from public schools underscores a
question of growing prominence in today's pluralistic times: How do
you make sure ancient scriptures mesh with modern-day sensibilities?</LD>
<LD>   The prevailing answer among scholars: You can't. No scripture is
politically correct--nor, many scholars argue, should anyone expect
it to be.</LD>
<LD>   New religious movements emerge precisely because the prevailing
faiths are deemed flawed in some major way, says Reuven Firestone, a
professor of medieval Judaism and Islam at Hebrew Union College in
Los Angeles. So if their scriptures rail against others as arrogant
sinners, unbelievers, idol worshippers and the like--well, that's
their job, Firestone says.</LD>
<TE>   "Scripture is a divinely authoritative way to prove the old
systems are no longer proper and that there is a need for a new
religious expression," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Religious scholars say there is a plenty of political
incorrectness to go around in virtually all scriptures. The Hebrew
Bible trashes the prevailing Canaanite religion--and even calls for
the wholesale slaughter of those regarded as idol worshippers. In the
New Testament Gospel of Matthew, Jesus condemns the Pharisees, a
group of particularly observant Jews, as hypocrites and "sons of
vipers" destined for the "judgment of hell."</TE>
<TE>   The Koran urges believers to slaughter infidels "wherever you find
them" and not to befriend Christians or Jews. The Buddha criticizes
the Hindu priestly caste known as Brahmans, and Sikhism founder Guru
Nanak rose up to declare deficiencies in both the prevailing Muslim
and Hindu cultures of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things in every religion that contemporary followers of
that faith are embarrassed by, and should be," says Elliot Dorff, a
philosophy professor at the University of Judaism. "The question for
believers is: How do you continue to have faith in your own
tradition, and nonetheless shape it to accord with modern
sensibilities?"</TE>
<TE>   Many Muslims believe that question was never fully--or
fairly--vetted before 300 Korans were pulled from the shelves of the
Los Angeles Unified School District last week.  The books, a 1934
translation and commentary by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, a British Muslim of
Indian descent, were donated to the district in January by the Omar
Al Khattab Foundation in Los Angeles. On Monday, district officials
said a panel of Islamic experts and other educators will review
potential substitute translations.</TE>
<TE>   Ali's English translation of the Koran's original Arabic text is
the most popular among Muslims because it was one of the first. But
his commentary offended some school district personnel with such
passages as: "The Jews in their arrogance claimed that all wisdom and
all knowledge of Allah were enclosed in their hearts. Their claim was
not only arrogance but blasphemy."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say it is crucial to understand such passages in their
historical context. According to Mahmoud Abdel-Baset of the Islamic
Center of Southern California, Ali's commentary was not smearing Jews
per se, but only describing the attitude of the Jewish communities in
the Arabian city of Medina at the time, who rejected Muhammad's
message and claimed themselves as the sole recipients of divine
revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Ali's pique at those who refused to accept God's message was no
different, scholars say, than Jesus' railings against the Pharisees
or even the Hebrew prophets condemning their own spiritually wayward
people as an "unwanted vessel," a "ravaged vine."</TE>
<TE>   Singling out the Islamic sources for criticism was "unfair," says
Muzammil Siddiqi, religious director of the Islamic Center of Orange
County. "Why not pull out all of the religion books, and take out
books of English literature as well--Shakespeare, because of
Shylock," he says, referring to the unflattering Jewish character
portrayed in "The Merchant of Venice."</TE>
<TE>   Jewish texts have been misunderstood as well, says Rabbi Yitzchok
Adlerstein, chairman of Jewish law and ethics at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles. He said Talmudic exhortations to kill "the best of
non-Jews," refers only to wartime. Statements that most thieves in
the world were descendants of Ishmael--the progenitor of
Muslims--referred only to the way rabbis saw their neighbors at the
time--not any "essential truths" about Muslims today, he says. And
Jewish tradition offers at least eight interpretations of why the
seemingly vengeful "eye for an eye" exhortation is not to be taken
literally, Adlerstein says.</TE>
<TE>   On the question of what to do about politically incorrect
religious material, responses are mixed.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, such as Firestone and UCLA Islamic law scholar Khaled
Abou El Fadl, suggest taking care to choose material appropriate for
today's climate of interfaith tolerance. Abou El Fadl, for one,
favors a Koranic translation by Muhammad Asad, a convert to Islam,
who sought to interpret the divine book in a universal manner.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in examining the Koran's infamous passage to
slaughter all unbelievers, Asad cautions readers to balance this
command with more temperate ones--that there is no compulsion in
religion, for instance. By contrast, a less flexible translation
widely disseminated by Saudi Arabia, "The Noble Qur'an," emphasizes
the need to fight non-Muslims until they accept the Islamic creed
that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger.</TE>
<TE>   Abou El Fadl added that if objectionable commentaries are used, a
note should be attached to them putting the work into historical
context. Others, however, view that as a potentially endless task.</TE>
<TE>   "If we start putting notes in everything that bothers us, we're
going to be putting a lot of notes in a lot of books," says Marianne
Meye Thompson, professor of New Testament at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   University of Judaism professor Dorff says that religious
communities have dealt with problematic material in a number of ways.
The first is to repudiate it. In 1996, he says, the Evangelical
Lutheran Church of America repudiated Martin Luther's anti-Semitic
comments and has now formed a commission to create what he called a
"more positive theology about Jews and Judaism."</TE>
<TE>   Dorff says he himself wrote a ruling for the Conservative movement
in 1985 that repudiated traditional Jewish law against drinking wine
made by non-Jews, who were assumed to be idolaters. "We openly
repudiated that law based on the fact that relations with non-Jews
are different and we no longer consider Christians idolaters," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   For Orthodox Jews, however, throwing out tradition is not an
option.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, many seek to find acceptable understandings of seemingly
offensive material. Every morning, for instance, Adlerstein recites a
traditional blessing thanking God for not making him a non-Jew, slave
or woman. Although other movements have eliminated that blessing,
Adlerstein says he interprets it not as a criticism of others but as
praise to God for giving him more responsibility. Under traditional
law, he says, Jewish men were given more commandments than others to
keep.</TE>
<TE>   Another strategy for dealing with problem texts, Dorff says, is to
limit the scope of the offensive material.</TE>
<TE>   He says the Vatican has sought to alter perceptions of Jews as
"Christ killers" by issuing statements that New Testament references
to Jews at Jesus' crucifixion should not be taken to affix blame on
Jews of today.</TE>
<TE>   Limiting the scope of material can be tricky, however, if it is
done inside the sacred scriptures themselves.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based evangelical
Christian organization, charges that a new revision of a Bible
translation skews the sacred word in pursuit of political
correctness. In John 19:12, which recounts a crowd of Jews urging
Pilate not to release Jesus, the new revision narrows the scope of
responsibility to "Jewish leaders"--an unacceptable liberty, in the
eyes of Paul Hetrick, a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to isolate what happened in John 19:12 as the
responsibility only of Jewish leaders, and they do not have the right
or prerogative to introduce new words or editorialize like that," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Dorff said a third approach to dealing with offensive texts is to
create modern commentaries that point out their anachronistic nature.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Catholic priests would read historical reproaches, or
commentaries, during Lent that Dorff says scolded Jews for being
involved in the crucifixion of Jesus. But as a result of a
Jewish-Catholic dialogue in 1973, he says, the L.A. archdiocese
instructed priests to drop these words or precede them with new
commentaries urging Catholics to reflect instead on how they
themselves may have failed in embracing Jesus' teachings.</TE>
<TE>   For the long run, Firestone suggested that Muslim Americans
commission a committee of scholars to write a new Koranic commentary
suitable for modern times, just as Jews and Christians have done. "It
has to reflect the values of a pluralistic society, and Islam does
not contradict that," he says.</TE>

<HD>Former Attorney Is Charged With Stealing $380,000</HD>
<DH>Crime: She is accused of embezzling from two brothers later
shot to death by an intruder in Inglewood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former lawyer was charged Friday with embezzling $380,000 from two
Inglewood brothers who were shot to death after they reported the
alleged crime.</LD>
<LD>   Angela F. Wallace, 41, stole Howard Byrdsong's inheritance, then
offered to pay off the 20-year-old man if he didn't tell, according
to the 10-page criminal complaint.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace was helping Byrdsong collect a life insurance policy left
to him and his brother, Jontrae Byrdsong, 18, after their mother, a
Los Angeles police officer, died of natural causes in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, Wallace was barred from law practice.</TE>
<TE>   She had been suspended by the State Bar of California for
misappropriation of other client funds.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Wallace directed the insurance company to send the
check to her All American Law Firm in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   She opened a bank account using a forged power of attorney,
deposited the check, then wrote at least nine unauthorized checks
from the account, one for $130,200, prosecutors contend.</TE>
<TE>   A man allegedly representing Wallace offered to pay Byrdsong
$125,000 and an additional $143,631 later if he would rescind his
forgery affidavit with the bank, the complaint said.</TE>
<TE>   The Byrdsongs also filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The D.A.'s office became involved in the investigation prior to
the murders," spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. "The boys came to us
after they believed they were being robbed."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors began their investigation into the embezzlement
allegations last spring. Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald E. Goudy of the
office's Organized Crime Division will prosecute the case.</TE>
<TE>   The Byrdsongs were fatally shot June 6, 2001, by an intruder at
the Inglewood home where they were living. The killer has not been
found.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Timothy Mack, 56, was also charged in the
alleged Byrdsong embezzlement.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons described Mack as a friend of Wallace's. The two are each
charged with conspiracy to commit grand theft, grand theft by
embezzlement and perjury for allegedly obtaining a false driver's
license. Wallace is also charged with three counts of forgery.</TE>
<TE>   She was being held Friday at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility
in lieu of $460,000 bail. Her arraignment is set for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mack, who was arrested Feb. 5, pleaded not guilty to the charges
at his Feb. 7 arraignment. He remains in custody on $750,000 bail. A
preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, a graduate of the USC Law School, was suspended from the
State Bar for two years in 1999 and placed on five years' probation
after agreeing to misconduct charges in six cases, according to the
California Bar Journal, the bar's official publication. She resigned
from the bar in May 2001 with disciplinary charges pending.</TE>

<HD>Arson Suspect's Wife Surrenders</HD>
<DH>Crime: The couple are accused of setting fire to a Pasadena
home after a bank failed to return deposit on purchase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after a Los Angeles County Fire Department public information
officer was arrested on arson charges, his wife turned herself in
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The couple are accused of setting a fire that severely damaged a
house at 1541 N. Raymond Ave. in Pasadena last July.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Sprewell, 37, was freed late Thursday on $50,000 bail.
Judge Terry Summers released Heidi Sprewell, 36, on her own
recognizance Friday. The couple will be arraigned March 7 on one
count each of felony arson. The charge carries a maximum penalty of
six years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the Altadena couple set the fire after a
bank refused to return a deposit on the home that they had tried to
buy.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Podberesky, the Sprewells' attorney, said that her clients,
who have three children between the ages of 9 and 18, have been
cooperating with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Podberesky said she believed that the county's case was made
largely on circumstantial evidence. "I'm confident that the evidence
in the case will demonstrate that the Sprewells are not guilty of the
charges," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The single-family home, which was vacant at the time of the fire,
is owned by the Pasadena Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit
community redevelopment organization, and has served in the past as a
private Christian academy. The building is empty, its windows boarded
up, its roof charred, and a truck-sized Dumpster filled with debris a
permanent fixture on the front lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz declined to comment on the
investigation, but said his office had been working with
investigators since the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Because Sprewell is a former Pasadena firefighter, the Pasadena
Fire Department referred the case to the Alhambra-based San Gabriel
Valley Arson Explosives Task Force, a team made up of members of the
Alhambra Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed Friday that it
had placed Sprewell, 36, on paid administrative leave, as is the
department's policy.</TE>
<TE>   He is the latest in a series of firefighters accused of arson.
Earlier this month, a Los Angeles firefighter, captured after 2 1/2
years on the run, was sentenced to two years in prison for setting
fire to the carport of his estranged wife's apartment. In 1998, a
former Glendale arson investigator was sentenced to life without the
possibility of parole for setting a fire that killed four people at a
South Pasadena hardware store.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 16, Files Claim Over Treatment in Baby Dumping Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pasadena lawyer says he has filed a claim against the city of
Monrovia on behalf of a 16-year-old girl who was arrested and
examined during the search for the mother of an abandoned baby.</LD>
<LD>   The claim alleges false arrest, false imprisonment and violation
of the girl's civil rights and asks for $1 million in damages,
attorney Joe Hopkins said.</LD>
<LD>   Baby Andrew, as the infant was named, was found in a trash bin
behind an apartment complex in the 700 block of West Foothill
Boulevard at 10:50 p.m. Jan. 19.</LD>
<TE>   The 16-year-old, who lives in the Bay Area city of San Leandro,
was spending that night with two older sisters who live in a Monrovia
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia police using bloodhounds traced the mother's scent to
within 15 feet of the sisters' apartment door, said Capt. Roger
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   They interviewed the girl, who denied being the baby's mother.
After searching the apartment and taking DNA samples, they made a
probable-cause arrest, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was taken to Methodist Hospital in Arcadia about 4:30 a.m
for a physical exam, which indicated she could not have been the
mother. She was then taken to the station and released by 8:30 a.m.,
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins said that according to the police reports, the evidence
that indicated probable cause included a printed garbage can liner in
the apartment similar to the plastic bag that Baby Andrew had been
wrapped in.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson would not comment on the nature of the evidence, but said
it was sufficient for an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Our detective consulted with the district attorney's command post
to get a second opinion to support making a probable-cause arrest,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hopkins said his client was unfairly singled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I know why they went to that place: because they felt it had to
be a black parent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins also objected to the invasive physical test.</TE>
<TE>   "How many cops want their virgin 16-year-old daughters arrested?"
Hopkins said. "They'd be screaming bloody murder."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that during the course of the investigation, the
detectives had contacted the hospital, which said the woman who had
given birth to the child could be in medical danger. As a result, he
said, police would not have been able to book a suspect into jail
without verifying her health.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a young girl who may have recently delivered a
child ... it would be irresponsible for the police to take her into
custody without medical clearance," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 25, police arrested the girl now suspected of being the
baby's mother.</TE>
<TE>   She lives near the site where the baby was found. She also was
taken to the hospital before being booked, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The city has 45 days to respond to the claim. If the claim is
denied, Hopkins said, he plans to file a civil lawsuit on the girl's
behalf.</TE>

<HD>The Peacocks Are Gone, but Artist Staying Close to the
Family Nest</HD>
<DH>Culture: Santa Paula etcher preserves the memory and work
of her celebrated grandparents, Cornelis and Jessie Botke.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The screaming peacocks are gone. The pheasants have flown the coop.
Now only the clucking chickens remain.</LD>
<LD>   Kitty Botke, who grew up on a 10-acre slice of rural Santa Paula,
has kept a rich artistic legacy alive for the last 30 years. Her
grandparents, the late Cornelis and Jessie Arms Botke, are among
California's most celebrated artists, known for their landscape
etchings and luminous bird paintings.</LD>
<LD>   They bought a hilly patch of Wheeler Canyon in 1929 and built two
homes, a studio and several aviaries among the rattlesnakes and
apricot trees. They filled the cages with deep blue peacocks and
golden pheasants.</LD>
<TE>   Jessie painted the birds while Cornelis etched the towering
eucalyptus trees. They called the place Screaming Peacock Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really proud of them," recalled Kitty Botke, 50, an
artist who still lives on the property with her parents. "All the
grammar school kids would come up here and they would all get a tour
of the studio.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be nothing but ranchers up here. They chose this
place because it was close to Los Angeles and far from everything
else."</TE>
<TE>   Jessie Botke's work can be found in art galleries and public
buildings from Los Angeles to Chicago. One of her bird murals hangs
behind the checkout counter at the Oxnard Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   Her works can still go for up to $70,000 at auction, and many have
been mass-produced as posters.</TE>
<TE>   Museum Head Tries to Collect Works</TE>
<TE>   Tim Schiffer, executive director of the Ventura County Museum of
History and Art, is trying to form a larger collection of the Botkes'
work.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to collect them in depth because of their
importance to California art," Schiffer said. "Both were classically
trained. Jessie's paintings are very pleasant to be around. She had a
distinct style and she put gold leaf in the background of her work.
Cornelis was a master etcher. Etching is an extremely demanding but
beautiful medium."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Granata, who heads the arts education group Focus on the
Masters, is producing a documentary on the Botke family.</TE>
<TE>   "Kitty Botke is an outstanding artist in her own right, but I am
after the whole package," Granata said. "Her grandparents were two of
the most celebrated artists of the 20th century. Jessie did big bold
commercial illustrations. She met and was highly influenced by
Georgia O'Keeffe. Cornelis was overshadowed by her, but he was just
as skilled and respected."</TE>
<TE>   The pair met in Chicago in 1914. They lived in San Francisco and
Carmel before settling in Santa Paula. The entire Botke clan lived on
the ranch--Jessie and Cornelis, their children, and their children's
children.</TE>
<TE>   Botkes Spent Most of Their Time in Studio</TE>
<TE>   Jessie and Cornelis spent their days in the studio, although
sometimes she would paint birds at the San Diego Zoo or at the aviary
on Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   "They were wonderful grandparents," Botke said. "They were a lot
of fun to be around. They weren't rich but they made enough to travel
around Europe during the Depression."</TE>
<TE>   Cornelis, who was born in Holland, died in 1954, and Chicago-born
Jessie died in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Kitty is the only other member of the family to become an artist.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she has produced second editions of her
grandparents' work while honing her own etching and painting skills.</TE>
<TE>   Botke works in her grandparents' studio, a converted horse barn
with dark, creaky wood floors. Yellowed books with cracked spines
line antique shelves, a brass Turkish coffee maker sits on a table
and a silent grandfather clock stands in the corner--all remnants of
Cornelis and Jessie's life.</TE>
<TE>   Having such famous grandparents hasn't been easy for Botke.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to find my own way," she said as she began
etching a landscape onto a copper plate. "Through printmaking, I
found my own voice."</TE>
<TE>   She would like to spend more time in the studio but it's a big
ranch. She cares for her parents, manages the help and keeps an eye
on the chickens.</TE>
<TE>   Artwork Is Meant to Be Powerful</TE>
<TE>   Her closet is full of paintings of forlorn nudes with searching
eyes, drunken cats and wind-blown trees on stormy plains. She says
her work isn't meant to be depressing, it's meant to be powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have a house full of that and never feel sad," she said.
"I like etching because there are a million ways to make a print and
it is so moody."</TE>
<TE>   While Botke's work is often dark, her studio is lined with the
ivory plumed peacocks, yellow pheasants and surreal landscapes of her
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Jessie Botke would pause from her painting to read
selections from Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories" to her
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The book is still on the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Botke picked it up and flipped through it.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is like a cathedral," she said.</TE>

<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn voiced new concerns Friday to the agency studying
the secession proposals for the San Fernando Valley and harbor area,
saying it must expand the scope of environmental impact reports that
are already underway.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local
Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles County, Hahn said that the
reports being prepared by a LAFCO consultant must look at any impact
that secession might have not just on the breakaway areas but on what
would remain of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Secession proponents called the request a delaying tactic.</LD>

<HD>Wanted: A Few Good Men for God, Military</HD>
<DH>Faith: At Catholic conference in Anaheim, Air Force
chaplain has tough recruiting job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a young man, Michael Biewend knew there were two things he didn't
want in life--to become a Roman Catholic priest and to join the
military.</LD>
<LD>   So it might seem strange that on Friday, Lt. Col. Biewend, a
49-year-old Air Force priest, was at the Anaheim Convention Center,
recruiting for the military's chaplain service.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to explain," he said of his dual conversion.</LD>
<TE>   It's easier for him to explain why he tries to persuade others to
join.</TE>
<TE>   "We're critically short," Biewend said of the 105 officer-priests
who serve Catholics in the Air Force. "We can't cover all of the
ground that we need to."</TE>
<TE>   As about 20,000 Catholics from around the world gather this
weekend in Anaheim for the annual Los Angeles-area Religious
Education Congress, a small but significant job recruitment effort is
being waged amid the workshops and booths selling anything from
Bibles to $9.98 rocks from the Holy Land.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the Roman Catholic Church is struggling to cope with a
severe shortage of priests, nuns and brothers. As the current ranks
age, fewer young men and women are taking up the religious life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult challenge," said Bishop Edward Clark of the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles. "The vocation does not appeal to as many
young people as it used to."</TE>
<TE>   Blame the economic and personal sacrifices priests and nuns make,
the lure of mainstream culture and careers. Blame smaller families.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of reasons," said Father Gary Bauler, a priest in
Simi Valley. Among them, he said, are recent scandals involving sex
between clergy and parishioners. "The image of [the] priesthood has
suffered a great deal.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to seminary 35 years ago, they were standing in line,
waiting to get in. You were worried that you wouldn't make the cut
and would be thrown out."</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles archdiocese, for instance, a flock of 4 million
people is served by about 540 priests--about half what is needed.</TE>
<TE>   So the archdiocese, along with the dioceses in Orange and San
Bernardino counties, are seeking candidates for the religious life at
this weekend's conference.</TE>
<TE>   So are the Dominican Family, St. Patrick's Seminary and the
Sisters of the Holy Names.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's youth day service, a call went out for anyone
interested in a Catholic vocation. More than 200 kids responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Many won't pan out. But every year, we pick up a few people that
way," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we don't get a single candidate, we at least raise
people's consciousness of the need."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Lt. Col. Biewend hopes to do--for his faith and his
country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking for a mechanic. I'm not looking for a pilot,"
said Biewend, whose office last year persuaded seven Catholic priests
to join the military for at least three years.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm looking for [is] someone who is excited about being in
the church. Someone who is excited about working with young people."</TE>

<LD>Downey police said officers shot and killed a suspected drunk driver
who tried to run officers down during a 12-minute chase early Friday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third time in eight months that Downey police have been
involved in a shooting in which investigators said a suspected drunk
driver tried to hit officers.</LD>
<LD>   In the other incidents, in December and June, the drivers were
only wounded.</LD>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, said that in accord with policy for fatal police
shootings, a deputy district attorney would investigate. The
coroner's office said the man had not been identified. Downey Police
Lt. Jim McCulloch gave no estimated age or description and would not
say if the man had been armed.</TE>
<TE>   McCulloch said the chase, which followed both the Santa Ana and
605 freeways, ended up in a Downey neighborhood near Newville Avenue
and Farm Street, where the man was shot after his Buick Regal struck
another car.</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant said the attempt to run officers down occurred a
few minutes before the shooting, when the man drove down an
embankment and then turned and came back toward officers and the

<HD>R. Chiprut, 54; Latino-Focused Doctor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Roberto Chiprut, who co-founded a fast-growing Southern
California physician network that provides care tailored to the
Latino community, has died. He was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Chiprut died Sunday from injuries suffered in a car accident
outside Mexico City. His wife, Cesiah, was injured and remains in
serious condition in a Mexico City hospital.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, Chiprut co-founded, with Jose J. Gonzalez, Latino Health
Care, the largest medical network in Southern California catering to
Latinos.</LD>
<TE>   The network has grown from about 750 doctors in 1996 to more than
2,200 today in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and San
Diego counties, as well as in the San Jose area. It was named the
third fastest-growing Latino-owned and -operated business in the
United States by Hispanic Business magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Chiprut, a West Los Angeles internist who had been a clinical
professor of medicine at UCLA, believed that Latinos were generally
underserved and misunderstood by mainstream medicine.</TE>
<TE>   He and Gonzalez, a health-care consultant, built a network that
features independent, largely Spanish-speaking physicians working out
of small neighborhood offices rather than large clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Chiprut was born in Mexico City and received his medical training
at the National University of Mexico, the University of Tel Aviv, the
University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Temple, Texas, and the University
of Miami.</TE>
<TE>   While at Miami, Chiprut conducted research showing that bacteria
could produce ulcers. He was the author of more than 50 articles in
professional journals in his specialty of gastroenterology and
co-edited, with UCLA professor David E. Hayes-Bautista, "Healing
Latinos: The Art of Clinical Competence in Medicine," a well-received
book on treating Latino patients.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Chiprut began to limit his Los Angeles practice and
returned to his native city because he felt his expertise was greatly
needed there, Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   Chiprut helped to establish the Mexican Institute of Clinical
Research in Mexico City, and served as its president and chief
executive. He also was organizing the first Latin American Congress
of Clinical Research, to be held in Mexico City later this month, to
train medical professionals on how to conduct proper clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good-hearted man with an entrepreneurial spirit and real
cultural caring," said Dr. Seymour Levine, a close friend and UCLA
colleague.</TE>
<TE>   Chiprut was especially proud of his role in founding the Mexico
City institute, which he hoped would expand the range and raise the
quality of clinical research in Mexico. Since its founding in 2000,
the institute has run more than 30 clinical trials and treated
several thousand patients.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Chiprut is survived by a daughter and two
sons from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a memorial service are pending.</TE>

<HD>Davis OKs Increase in Workers' Comp</HD>
<DH>Labor: 'It may be overdue. But it has arrived,' governor
says of the hike in benefits. Employers express alarm at potential
costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis, flanked by labor leaders and lawyers for injured
workers, signed a bill Friday granting significant hikes in benefits
to people hurt on the job, the first increase in almost a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Business representatives, who said they were cut out of final
negotiations on the bill, warned that the increase could end up
costing employers $1 billion more than the $2.4-billion annual price
tag that Davis placed on the measure.</LD>
<LD>   Using a Century City high-rise office construction site as a
backdrop, Davis said the bill "struck the right balance" between
workers' needs and employers' desires to keep costs in check.</LD>
<TE>   The measure, AB 749 by Assemblyman Tom Calderon (D-Montebello), a
candidate for insurance commissioner, calls for an overhaul of the
workers' compensation law that the administration says will pare $1.5
billion in costs from the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we are providing justice for working people," Davis said.
"It may be overdue. But it has arrived."</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor's decision to sign Calderon's bill cheered
key supporters--labor and trial lawyers--as the state Democratic
convention opened in Los Angeles and as Davis seeks reelection. He
vetoed similar bills three years running, prompting organized labor
to threaten an initiative this year that would have raised employers'
costs by $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Davis at the bill signing was former refinery worker Steve
Duncan, who survived a 60-foot fall and burns over 40% of his body
when a fire broke out at a Tosco facility in the Bay Area two years
ago. Duncan receives $490 a week in workers' compensation now. Under
the new law, the weekly check will rise to $602 starting next
January, and to $840 by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond 2006, benefits will increase automatically based on the
annual percentage that wages increase in California. The current high
of $160,000 to survivors of workers killed on the job will double.</TE>
<TE>   Organized labor has long sought automatic raises. In the past,
when labor turned to the Legislature for benefit increases, employers
could seek changes in the law limiting their costs. But with benefits
rising automatically, employers could lose leverage, business
representatives say.</TE>
<TE>   "Another nail in the coffin of California business--especially
manufacturers," said Jack Stewart, president of the California
Manufacturers and Technology Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart cited an analysis by the independent Workers Compensation
Insurance Ratings Bureau, which estimated the cost of the benefit
increases at $3.5 billion annually.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when on-the-job injuries are declining, the ratings
bureau recently projected the cost of workers' compensation at $15.2
billion for 2003, without the benefit hike, up from $8 billion in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   "How does a small business deal with that?" Stewart asked.</TE>
<TE>   Medical care accounts for more than half the costs. The
administration believes that the Calderon bill will cut costs by
opening the way for major health maintenance organizations to expand
into the workers' comp field.</TE>
<TE>   Davis appeared unclear on another major provision aimed at saving
money for employers.</TE>
<TE>   The state plans to use money from taxes levied on workers'
compensation insurance premiums to subsidize employers by paying part
of the wages of injured workers who return to their jobs early.</TE>
<TE>   In 2004, when the state subsidy begins, the state will contribute
about $87 million in employer subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, that money flows into the general fund and is used for
a variety of state programs. Davis said, however, that the money does
not come from the budget's general fund, a statement later corrected
by an aide.</TE>

<HD>Monitor Tracks LAPD Efforts at Reform</HD>
<DH>Update: Chief's foes, friends find evidence in the report
to support their opposing views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A report card issued Friday cites numerous problems with the Los
Angeles Police Department's efforts to carry out a federal consent
decree, but it says that the LAPD continues to move ahead briskly in
its efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Despite failures in a number of specific areas, overall the city
and the department "continued to make significant progress on reform"
during the last quarter of 2001, said the report by a federal
court-appointed monitor.</LD>
<LD>   The report, filed with U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess, was the
second such evaluation of the LAPD's reform efforts completed by
independent monitor Michael Cherkasky.</LD>
<TE>   The document raises the concern that some officers still display a
"lack of commitment" to the reforms, and cites many instances in
which deadlines have not been met.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the report does not specifically accuse the LAPD of
deliberately trying to impede overall progress on police reform.
Rather, many problems cited in the report appear to be related to the
department's struggles to get a lot of work done in a short amount of
time.</TE>
<TE>   Compliance with the decree has been a contentious issue dividing
Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, who faces an
uncertain future as his first term ends.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has opposed another term for Parks, citing his disappointment
at the LAPD's compliance efforts as one reason. Parks maintains that
the department has moved swiftly and successfully to bring about
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Because the consent decree involves dozens of highly complex
requirements and timelines, definitions of compliance vary.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's aides say that in every detail the city should be in 100%
compliance all the time; defenders of the chief call that a
simplistic and impractical view.</TE>
<TE>   The monitor's report contains no conclusive ruling on compliance.
It merely comments on areas in which progress has been made and
highlights those in which difficulties have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, people on both sides of the debate over the chief
quickly seized on those aspects of the report that seemed to
vindicate them.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the document
"supports what Hahn has been saying, which is that we are not in
total compliance with the consent decree--particularly in crucial
areas such as use-of-force investigations and tracking of internal
investigations."</TE>
<TE>   But City Councilman Nate Holden, a Parks supporter, took the
opposite tack. The report "really validates what the Police
Department has been doing," he said. It shows "all the misinformation
that has been disseminated to the community by the mayor and mayor's
office that reform was not taking place--it's not true."</TE>
<TE>   In one area in particular, Cherkasky expressed concern that things
were moving too quickly. He said tight deadlines mean the city's
effort to create an integrated computer system to track officers has
been rushed.</TE>
<TE>   This project is a key reform that has been sought by LAPD critics
as far back as the Christopher Commission in 1991. Its implementation
is considered one of the most difficult requirements of the decree.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other problems the monitor found during the quarter
ending Dec. 31 were missed deadlines on investigations into the use
of force by officers and a persistent backlog of complaint
investigations.  But the monitor also said the LAPD has instituted
stricter oversight of the use of force and made changes to its
procedures and reporting requirements that, in some instances, exceed
minimum standards.</TE>

<HD>Hahn: LAPD's Not Doing Enough</HD>
<DH>Violence: The mayor cites rise in crime on the Eastside,
where 14 have been slain this year.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn continued to sound the alarm about
the city's crime rate during a visit Friday to the Eastside, where 14
people have been slain already this year.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn said the Los Angeles Police Department has not done enough to
combat a recent crime wave in Boyle Heights and the rest of the city.
In January, there were 76 homicides in the city, almost twice the
number last year.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't continue at this pace for the rest of the year," he said
during a tour of a neighborhood garden run by Las Madres del Este de
Los Angeles-Santa Isabel, a local activist group.</LD>
<TE>   "That would just return us to a level of homicides that we haven't
seen for 25 years in this city," Hahn added. "So we have to stop
this, and stop it quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's efforts to draw attention to crime in the city come as he
is attempting to build public support for his decision to oppose a
second term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn and Parks agree that violent crime has increased 17% over the
last two years, but disagree over how to interpret that increase.</TE>
<TE>   Parks argues that although the recent trends are significant,
overall crime is still at one of the lowest levels it has been in 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to put things in perspective and realize where we were
five or 10 years ago," said Lt. Horace Frank, a spokesman for the
department. "That is not in any way to diminish the concerns we
have.... The officers in the department have been working very
diligently to address these issues all over the city."</TE>
<TE>   Frank said the LAPD has tried to cope with the spike in homicides
on the Eastside by putting an additional 3,912 working hours in the
Hollenbeck Division in January. Those increases were made possible by
bringing in officers from LAPD special enforcement units and the
Metro Division, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor said the Police Department needs to respond more
quickly to problems, deploy more patrols and add more special
enforcement units to address chronic problems such as drug
trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also noted that the LAPD remains about 1,200 officers short
of its authorized strength, which he said hampers the department's
ability to cope with the increase in crime.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor did not make any specific suggestions about how the LAPD
could deploy its officers while trying to hire more.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to look at the entire organization of LAPD and see if
there is a better way to deploy the scarce resources that we have,"
Hahn said. "I'm not going to go through every single division of LAPD
and micromanage that. I think the message is ... we need help now.
It's [the LAPD's] job to figure out how to find out how we can get
that help."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was joined by City Councilman Nick Pacheco, who said he would
like officers brought in to prevent crimes in the neighborhoods he
represents.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real high sense of fear right now in the community that
I've never seen before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the homicides have been gang-related, officials said, and
several bystanders have been caught in the cross-fire. In late
January, a pregnant mother sitting in her car was shot and killed. On
Sunday, an off-duty Marine was slain outside his parents' house on
Breed Street.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of violence, and in the last few months, it's
really gone up," said Maria Henriquez, who lives a few blocks from
where one of the recent killings occurred. "It makes me so scared."</TE>
<TE>   The spate of shootings has made many people fearful to go out at
night, said her husband, Carlos, as the couple left a corner park
Friday afternoon with their 2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "The gangs come out and fight and people get shot," he said. "It
happens all the time."</TE>

<HD>Jury Picked in Mauling Death Trial</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury was selected Friday in the trial of a San Francisco couple
charged in the dog-mauling death of their neighbor last year.</LD>
<LD>   Opening statements are scheduled Tuesday in Los Angeles County
Superior Court, where the trial was moved because of excessive
publicity in the Bay Area. The panel of seven men and five women,
along with six alternate jurors, will hear testimony for an estimated
four to five weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "All right folks, you're it," said Superior Court Judge James
Warren.</LD>
<TE>   Diane Whipple, a 33-year-old college lacrosse coach, was attacked
by two large Presa Canario dogs as she tried to enter her apartment
Jan. 26, 2001. One of the dogs, Bane, latched onto Whipple's neck and
the other, Hera, tore at her clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Marjorie Knoller, 46, and her husband, Robert Noel, 60, were
indicted in the attack. Prosecutors allege that the couple, both of
whom are lawyers, were involved in a conspiracy with white
supremacist prison inmates to run an attack-dog breeding ring.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel are each charged with involuntary manslaughter
and owning a vicious dog. Knoller, who was present at the time of the
attack, is also charged with second-degree murder. She faces 15 years
to life in state prison if convicted. Noel faces a possible sentence
of four years.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection began last month, when the court brought in more
than 500 prospective jurors. They were questioned about their
experiences with dogs and about their knowledge of the case.</TE>

<HD>3 Youths Charged in Campus Shooting</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three teenage boys have each been charged with attempted murder,
assault with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery in a Feb. 6
shooting that led to a five-hour lockdown at Gardena High School.</LD>
<LD>   All three entered pleas equivalent to not guilty in arraignments
Wednesday and Thursday in Long Beach Juvenile Court, and were ordered
to appear at a March 12 hearing to set proceedings to determine
whether they should be tried as adults.</LD>
<LD>   Those charged are two 17-year-olds and a 15-year-old, said Det.
Patricia Guerra of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their names are
being withheld because they are under 18. The case is being handled
by the LAPD because Gardena High School is within its jurisdiction.</LD>
<TE>   The victims of the incident, both of whom were shot and wounded
but were sent home after hospital treatment, are Carlos Flores, 19,
and Stephanie Alonzo, 16, both of Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects allegedly approached Flores between classes and
demanded money. When he told them he didn't have any, one of the
assailants allegedly produced a gun and shot him in the back, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alonzo, a bystander, was shot in the hip.</TE>
<TE>   Police locked down classrooms, holding 500 of Gardena High's 2,300
students until 7 p.m. in an unsuccessful search for the assailants
that night. One suspect surrendered the next day, and the two others
this week.</TE>

<HD>Computer Guru Reinvents Self as Top Gem Collector</HD>
<DH>Jewels: Former Apple president sees the precious stones as
a way to turn wealth into beauty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First to go was the 60-carat tanzanite.</LD>
<LD>   Then, a rare 36-carat tsavorite garnet, sparkling like an emerald.
Later, the serpentine tiara with a 242-carat tanzanite.</LD>
<LD>   One gorgeous stone after another was vanishing from the market
during the 1980s, but no one could figure out which aficionado, under
the alias "White Rose," was behind the buys.</LD>
<TE>   "A few isolated murmurings began to quietly pass among those in
the collecting community that 'something big' was happening in the
gem world as important stone after important stone disappeared from
the market," said Joel Bartsch, curator of gems and minerals at the
Houston Museum of Natural Science.</TE>
<TE>   It's natural enough that no one thought to look at Michael M.
Scott, lifelong computer devotee, adopter of stray cats, a man who
never even wore rings during his career. But after leaving his job as
the first president of Apple Computer in 1981, Scott entered the
world of jewelry with a passion, putting together a gemstone
collection that experts say rivals the holdings of royalty. Unlike
most royalty, he has his own gemology lab.</TE>
<TE>   First Time Collection on Public Display</TE>
<TE>   A portion of Scott's collection will go on public display for the
first time today at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "The gems he's collected are extremely rare, and they're
impressively large examples," said Elise B. Misiorowski, director of
the Carlsbad-based Gemological Institute of America.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's collection is noted for its rainbow range of colors and
the rarity of the stones, including black, pink and yellow diamonds,
red emeralds and pinkish-orange sapphires.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of this glittering trove is a quiet, 59-year-old
bachelor, who lives on five acres in Los Altos with four cats. He
sees the humor in his story line: computer exec turned obsessive
collector.</TE>
<TE>   Scott first made waves at Apple Computer when he helped launched
the Apple II personal computer and took the company public in 1980.
After clashing with founder Steve Jobs, he left the next year with
tens of millions of dollars worth of company stock.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen years ago, he shook off decades of habit to start buying
his stones. Jewelry was frowned on in the computer world. In fact,
wearing jewelry near the computers was banned when he took his first
college-level computer class at age 13.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you were told was that you absolutely couldn't
wear any rings. Never wear rings," said Scott, recalling the days
when data was fed into computers by punch card. If an operator was
wearing a ring that made a dent on the card, the machine could jam,
he said. "That stayed with me."</TE>
<TE>   "After I left Apple in 1981, I was trying not to be a Type A
personality anymore and realized I could have a piece of jewelry
now," he said. "There are no punch cards around anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Scott usually rotates portions of his collection among various
banks. The stones are the easiest way to turn wealth into beauty, he
said. And he thinks each stone touches the viewer in a different way.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll find your hand always shakes a little bit," he said during
the show's setup two weeks ago, as he gently lifted the 9-ounce
white-gold tiara set with the massive tanzanite, a deep-blue stone
found in Africa. The gem in the tiara is largest of its kind and is
surrounded by hundreds of tiny diamonds and light-green tsavorite
garnets from Africa. It is the centerpiece of the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's gemstones, shown in 125 groupings for the Bowers' "Gems!
The Art and Nature of Precious Stones," include the world's largest
known faceted gemstone: a 220-pound sculpted quartz crystal.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael is a unique collector in his ... determination to get the
rough and cut examples of virtually every gem species of exceptional
size and color," Misiorowski said. "He's amassed the most amazing gem
collection I've ever heard about."</TE>
<TE>   Scott's collection also features a necklace with the world's two
largest benitoites--bluish-violet gems found only in a small area of
San Benito County. Jeffrey Post, curator of the Smithsonian's
collection of more than 10,000 gems, met Scott several years ago. He
said of the Bowers show, "This is the first public exhibition in a
museum where a major portion of his collection is going to be on
exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   Scott has shown his gems at private gatherings in Germany, Seattle
and Los Angeles. He searched for six years for a museum that would
agree to show the breadth of his collection and give him creative
freedom. He was introduced to Bowers President Peter C. Keller by gem
photographer Erica Van Pelt, who had worked with both men. Keller, a
gemologist with a doctorate in geology from the University of Texas
at Austin, is curating the show.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit has three parts: an introduction to gemology; a
display of colored stones in a wide range of sizes; and gems
incorporated into jewelry and sculpture, such as a 10-carat Burmese
"pigeon's blood" ruby in an antique ring and a 64-carat royal-blue
Sri Lankan sapphire set in a golden cobra, and raw uncut stones.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said the pieces he's showing at the Bowers--a fifth of his
collection--are worth about $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Narrowly Avoided an Expensive Mistake</TE>
<TE>   He started during the 1980s with a stone that he thought was a
7-carat tsavorite. When he insisted on proof of the gem's quality, he
learned that he had nearly been duped into buying an artificial
stone. He found another 7-carat tsavorite, a real one this time. But,
determined not to be misled again, he delved into gemology, becoming
an expert on minerals and building a gem lab. In his early collecting
days, he traveled the world to make his purchases. Buyers and dealers
now come to him.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-carat tsavorite, one of Scott's most treasured pieces, is in
the Bowers show.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the nice things about it is that everyone thinks it's an
emerald," Scott said. "And that's part of the reason for the show.
People just think reds are for rubies, blues are for sapphires,
greens are for emeralds. But there's so much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of why I collect and show is because it's fun, whereas some
collectors just hoard and keep it to themselves. I want to show the
stones for others to enjoy and to see all this natural beauty that
Earth creates herself."</TE>

<HD>Inmates' Families Pay Heavy Price for Staying in Touch</HD>
<DH>Phones: State prisoners are limited to the costly option of
calling collect. California's pacts with firms yield millions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's an old slogan that sums up the power of a simple phone call:
Long distance, the saying goes, is the next best thing to being
there.</LD>
<LD>   For relatives of the incarcerated, this rings especially true. The
phone is often the only way for children to maintain bonds with
mothers, or for a wife to offer encouragement to an imprisoned
spouse.</LD>
<LD>   In California, however, staying in touch is an expensive
proposition for inmates' families. Under a system that benefits state
government to the tune of $35 million a year, relatives of those in
prison pay phone costs far higher than most others. The main reason:
The only way to dial out from behind bars is by calling collect.</LD>
<TE>   Under contracts with the state, two companies provide phone
service for inmates in adult prisons and California Youth Authority
facilities. For exclusive rights to that market--which yielded about
$85 million in revenue last year--the companies pay a handsome
commission to the state.</TE>
<TE>   After years of pressure, California officials this month signed
contracts that will cut phone rates by 25% for most inmates'
calls--and also trim the annual commission the government pulls in.</TE>
<TE>   State officials characterize the new agreements as a substantial
improvement for relatives of California's 158,000 prisoners. But
critics remain troubled by two issues: Inmates must still dial
collect, and the state will continue to receive a cut of the
proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) says that by taking the
commission, the state is improperly profiting off families whose only
crime is having a relative serving time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is profiteering on the backs of the innocent," Polanco said.
"It is just wrong to have a state policy that gouges the families of
inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Byron Tucker, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, disagrees. He
called the state's commission on the calls "revenue that California
is receiving rightfully for the services being provided."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Polanco will convene a joint legislative hearing on the
controversy in Los Angeles. African American churches from throughout
Southern California are busing in members--as many as 1,000 are
expected--to protest the policy. Other groups that work on behalf of
prisoners also are sending emissaries.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Eugene Williams, director of a network of 45
congregations in Los Angeles, calls the phone rates the single most
pressing economic issue for relatives of the incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   "Far too many of our members are having to decide whether they're
going to accept collect calls from loved ones who are incarcerated or
whether they are going to pay the rent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams says the rate cuts will help. But he agrees with Polanco
that it is ethically wrong for the state to get a commission from the
calls, a practice in effect for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, that share was a percentage of revenues from the
calls--most recently, about 40 cents of every dollar. In 1998, the
state earned $16 million from calls. By last year, its cut had soared
to about $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Other states also reap commissions on inmate calls, but some put
the income into programs that benefit prisoners or their families.
California funnels it into the general fund, the government's main
pool of money.</TE>
<TE>   Among those having a tough time with the charges is Rochelle
Adams, a legal assistant and single mother of two.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Adams had a brother and a close friend in prison.
Trying to keep up their spirits, she accepted their frequent collect
calls at her home in Downey. Then she got her phone bill. It was
$800.</TE>
<TE>   Adams was unable to pay the bill by the deadline, so her phone was
disconnected. For two months, she ran to a pay phone to make calls
and scrimped to pay off the debt.</TE>
<TE>   She said she asked her brother and friend to call at night, but
that didn't help because WorldCom does not lower rates for off-peak
times. In addition to the cost per minute, she paid a WorldCom
surcharge--about $3.50--each time a call was placed.</TE>
<TE>   Studies on recidivism have shown that prisoners who remain in
close contact with their families are less likely to commit new
offenses after being freed. Indeed, the state Board of Prison Terms
says family support is one of its criteria for deciding whether an
inmate is suitable for parole.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly see the benefit when inmates maintain ties with
their families," said Ernie Van Sant, deputy director for facility
management in the Department of Corrections. Because the state's
prisons are mostly in remote places, visiting in person is difficult
for many families. That leaves the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   For security reasons, phones in the state's 33 prisons--there are
about 90 per facility--and the Youth Authority permit only collect
calls. Inmates must use either WorldCom, which has held the contract
to serve most prisons since the early 1990s, or Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   A WorldCom spokeswoman said the cost of a collect call from a
prison ranges from 15 cents to 89 cents per minute, depending on how
far away the recipient lives. Calling collect outside prison, she
said, ranges from 10 cents to 80 cents a minute.</TE>
<TE>   But Californians not behind bars have a wide variety of choices,
including calling cards that can bring long-distance charges to as
low as five cents a minute. Those in prison, critics of the system
say, are truly a captive market.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to complaints from inmates' families, lawmakers have
for years pushed the administration to find a way to make calling
cheaper. In 2000, the Legislature gave bipartisan approval to a bill
that would have required the state to negotiate phone contracts with
the goal of providing the lowest rates possible, rather than the goal
of maximizing its economic return. Davis vetoed it.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials acknowledge, however, that the calling
costs are too high. That's why they have signed new, three-year
contracts with WorldCom and Verizon that cut rates by 25% for prisons
and by 78% in juvenile lockups. Under the agreements, the average
11-minute call from a prison to a home outside the immediate area
will fall from $6.30 to $5.08, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's office characterized the drop as a boon for
inmates' families. But Polanco and others are demanding that the
state forgo its commission on the $85 million in revenue the calls
generate each year.</TE>
<TE>   The new contracts do reduce that commission, capping it at $26
million a year, plus another $1 million to cover the state's
administrative costs. Eliminating it, some say, could persuade
WorldCom to further cut its rates.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also have argued that today's technology should enable
the state to do away with collect calling and switch to a direct-dial
system, allowing for a dramatic dip in costs.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have agreed to move toward the switch. But
modernizing the system will take at least three years, officials say.</TE>

<HD>GOP Candidates Intensify Attacks</HD>
<DH>Primary: The three vying for the governor's post speak
around the state, with taxes a main focus.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon said Friday he would back
an initiative to give homeowners and renters a $1.4-billion tax cut
if the Legislature does not do it first.</LD>
<LD>   The mechanism would be an increase of the homeowner's tax
exemption from the current level of $7,000 to $25,000 to $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   If the Legislature kills a bill to raise the exemption, as
expected, Simon said he and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. would
back an initiative in 2004 to make it a reality.</LD>
<TE>   Simon's campaign said the cost would be $1.4 billion if the
exemption is raised to the $25,000 threshold. By law, the renter's
credit would rise proportionally.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's vow came as the two other contestants for the GOP
nomination stepped up their attacks on each other and incumbent Gov.
Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, whose attacks have been sharpening
in recent days, cited his 20 years of experience in Sacramento and
dismissed his two opponents as wealthy opportunists who cannot handle
the state's budget deficit and other complex problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither one of them, if they walked out the door of the
governor's office, could find the way to the Department of Finance,"
Jones told a breakfast gathering held by the San Gabriel Valley
Lincoln Club. "This is not on-the-job training. This is not 'I've
done my career, I'm looking to retire, I'll become governor.'"</TE>
<TE>   The front-runner in the Republican race, former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, spoke to a Republican women's luncheon in Thousand
Oaks, where he continued to lash out at Davis, calling the governor
"the enemy of the state."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also launched his latest round of TV advertising Friday
night, returning to the positive tone that marked his earlier spots
and calling him "tough enough to turn California around." The
30-second ad replaces spots that began running last week in response
to an onslaught of negative ads from Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates have stepped up their schedules as the March 5
primary nears and the contest shows signs of tightening.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan canceled a skiing vacation to stump Friday and Monday.
Jones sped to Hemet on Friday to talk about his plan to shrink school
districts.</TE>
<TE>   And Simon announced his push for the tax exemption at quick stops
in San Diego and Hollywood before flying to San Jose and ending his
day in Salinas.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Simon was in such a hurry he barely had a chance to talk
about his proposal before a crowd of lunching senior citizens at the
senior multipurpose center in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd there greeted John Martin, director of the conservative
seniors group 60-Plus, with scattered boos when he was introduced as
knowing President Bush. The boos broke out again when Simon mentioned
the Jarvis group, named after the architect of the anti-tax
initiative Proposition 13. Though some listened politely, many
seniors continued to eat and chat with one another during Simon's
speech.</TE>
<TE>   "If you remember one thing today about Bill Simon, it's that I'm
the one who will lower taxes," Simon said. "I'm the only candidate
for governor you can trust to lower your taxes."</TE>
<TE>   "They all say that," grumbled Patrick Stiven, 74.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Vosburgh of the Jarvis association said that the homeowner's
exemption has not been raised since 1974. "Inflation has made the
current homeowner's exemption meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he would have to study Simon's proposal, but chided
his opponent for distorting the ex-mayor's record on taxes. The
former mayor said that he has supported Proposition 13, contrary to
Simon's past assertions: "There are a lot of things Mr. Simon is
saying that aren't true."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Jones said that he would not support a
"piecemeal" approach to cutting taxes, but would put together a
comprehensive plan once in office.</TE>

<HD>The Ambassador of Beverly Hills</HD>
<DH>Hospitality: The city's new official greeter welcomes
visitors, in a variety of languages, to ease their fears of
snootiness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The red coachman's coat from Sulka is carefully buttoned. The black
Bally shoes are perfectly shined. The gold name badge from Tiffany &amp;
Co. is polished and spotless.</LD>
<LD>   All that Gregg Donovan has to do before slipping on his Versace
sunglasses is slather some sunscreen on his face and check the tilt
of his black top hat in his reflection in the Battaglia storefront
window.</LD>
<LD>   "Welcome to Beverly Hills!" Donovan exclaims to no one in
particular. "You have arrived!"</LD>
<TE>   Donovan certainly has. The former hotel concierge, 42, has been
hired as Beverly Hills' first official greeter. His job is to welcome
the shoppers who the city hopes will bring some post-Sept. 11
recovery to the nation's glitziest shopping area.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day I come to work I feel like I'm in the 'Wizard of Oz'
and this is the Yellow Brick Road," Donovan said as he paused next to
a black Rolls-Royce parked on Rodeo Drive, in front of Bernini.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of passing Japanese tourists stared first at the Rolls and
then at Donovan. Suddenly, with a slight bow and a theatrical wave of
his arms, he started chattering in Japanese. The couple broke out in
titters.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan pulled a Japanese-language map from his coat pocket and
pointed the way to Gucci, a shop mentioned by the pair. As they
walked away, they turned and sneaked one last grinning peek at the
man in the red coat.</TE>
<TE>   "I basically said to them, 'What's up? I'm the ambassador of
Beverly Hills. Welcome to Beverly Hills. You have arrived,' " Donovan
explained.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan credits an ear for language and a phonetic memory as the
reason he can speak a little Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, French,
Dutch, German and Swedish. He claims he can say "Hello" and "Welcome
to Beverly Hills" in about 100 languages.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm waiting for the Dalai Lama to come to town so I can say it in
Tibetan," he laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan was a child actor ("my big break was a Canada Dry
commercial") before becoming a hotel doorman and, briefly,
entertainer Bob Hope's personal valet. After that he worked as a
concierge at such places as the downtown Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He was hired two years ago to work as a strolling concierge at 2
Rodeo, an upscale outdoor shopping mall. Research done in the late
1990s by UCLA economists suggested that there was a widespread
feeling that the rudeness experienced by the Julia Roberts character
in "Pretty Woman" was commonplace in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   So the faux Italian piazza hoped Donovan would counter the
perception that Beverly Hills merchants are snooty.</TE>
<TE>   His red-coated image was soon popping up in magazines and on TV in
places like Tokyo. When the tourist slump hit after September's
terrorist attacks, the Beverly Hills Conference and Visitors Bureau
recruited him to help roll out the welcome mat for the whole business
district.</TE>
<TE>   "The high-end merchants love him. They appreciate how he draws
visitors out and makes them feel comfortable," said Jeb Baird,
director of the bureau. "Visitors appreciate his enthusiasm. And he
strikes the right balance with residents: He doesn't throw himself in
front of them."</TE>
<TE>   His new job pays about $30,000 a year. But shops such as Brioni
and restaurants such as the Grill on the Alley give him uniforms and
free lunches. Stylists at Jose Eber give him complimentary haircuts
and Donovan is free to take outside jobs--like a planned August
promotional trip to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan had been making the rounds of Rodeo Drive and neighboring
streets for about two weeks last month when he spied the first big
sign of an economic upturn. Traveling down Rodeo Drive was the first
busload of Japanese tourists he had seen since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Gregg's been saying things were going to bounce back and he's
right," said Ryan Gillette, a 24-year-old waiter who was on his way
to his lunchtime shift at McCormick &amp; Schmick's.</TE>
<TE>   Tour guide Robin Weiner agreed. "People are traveling again,"
Weiner told Donovan as she shepherded several dozen British students
back aboard a bus after a short stop for shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Tourist Melanie Crosweller, 16, told of the stopover's high point.
"We went over to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and asked if we could
take a picture and the doorman said, 'Come on in! Welcome to Beverly
Hills!' and held the door open for us," she excitedly told Weiner.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan decided to walk over to the hotel to thank the Beverly
Wilshire's chief doorman, 31-year veteran Hans Rosenberg. "He's
Beverly Hills' real ambassador if you ask me," Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   On his way, he passed the David Orgell jewelry store and
introduced himself to shopper Vicki London of Brentwood. "That was
very cute--it was darling. I like it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Near Wilshire Boulevard, several Australian visitors asked him to
point out celebrity hangouts. Donovan was happy to oblige--although
he never fingers actual celebrities he often sees shopping in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't want to be perceived as snooty, Donovan said. But he
doesn't want to invade anyone's privacy.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Won't Join Democrats Meeting in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Politics: The mayor says he's too busy to attend the
convention. Some say the decision reflects his irritation with the
party and Gov. Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gov. Gray Davis rallies hundreds of Democratic party faithful
gathered this morning for the state convention at the Westin
Bonaventure in downtown Los Angeles, one Democrat will be
conspicuously absent.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn, whose city is hosting the convention, is not
attending the three-day event.</LD>
<LD>   What's keeping Hahn too busy to attend the annual gathering of
state and national party leaders? The mayor will be sitting in the
back of a cream-colored convertible about 10 blocks away, waving to
parade-goers celebrating Chinese New Year. As grand marshal, Hahn
will help paint the eyes on the golden dragon, part of what aides say
is a busy weekend schedule.</LD>
<TE>   But Hahn's absence also represents the latest sign of what some
see as the distance that has grown between the lifelong Democrat and
his political party.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the state Democratic Party endorsed rival Antonio
Villaraigosa and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on mailers
and phone calls to its members supporting his candidacy. Davis also
campaigned with the former Assembly speaker.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Hahn accused the party of skirting campaign laws by
accepting massive donations in earmarked funds. The state Fair
Political Practices Commission rejected that claim in August.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there has been little communication between Hahn and
the governor. Hahn was notably missing in August when seven
Democratic mayors joined the governor in Sacramento to endorse Davis'
reelection campaign. (Hahn was vacationing in Hawaii.) He has still
not said if he will back Davis in this year's governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders insist that they are not annoyed with the mayor for
missing the event.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his schedule is just totally conflicted," said state
Chairman Art Torres.</TE>
<TE>   "I can say on the governor's behalf that he doesn't view it as a
slight," added Garry South, Davis' top campaign strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook also stressed that the issue was
scheduling--not settling scores. "People shouldn't read anything into
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn does intend, however, to continue to consider his options in
the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important for Jim Hahn's point of view that the
governor recognize that Los Angeles is an important city, and that
there are a lot of things he can do for it," said Democratic
consultant Kam Kuwata, who was Hahn's communications director during
the mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's decisions on whether to endorse Davis or attend the
convention may not mean that much to the outcome of the race. But his
nonappearance gives Republicans an opening to take a shot at the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a smart move for Hahn," said GOP consultant Dan Schnur.
"Being on camera with Gray Davis is probably the last thing that any
smart politician would want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Still, being a no-show at a convention held in his city will not
be forgotten, some said. Among other things, Hahn will miss an event
that includes some of the party's biggest names: Democratic Party
Chairman Terry McAuliffe, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and
Sens. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.)</TE>
<TE>   "If his reason for not attending is ... the lingering resentment
about the party's support for Villaraigosa, it's pretty short-sighted
on his part," said campaign consultant Roy Behr, who helped Rep. Jane
Harman win back her South Bay seat in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Los Angeles political strategist Rick Taylor said Hahn
should play host to the visiting Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a real Democrat, you do it," Taylor said. "You may not
be happy. But he won. It's easy to forgive when you win."</TE>
<TE>   In Hahn's absence, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo is serving as Los
Angeles' official greeter. It will be the latest high-profile
appearance for the young official, who addressed the Democratic
National Committee last month at the group's winter meeting in
Washington, D.C.</TE>

<LD>Spurred on by the hit-and-run death of a Ventura woman the day
before, a city official said Friday he will push to have a stoplight
placed at the busy Avenue intersection where the accident occurred
and for a review of increased traffic congestion on the west side.</LD>
<LD>   "It's outrageous that this hasn't been taken care of many years
ago," said Councilman Jim Monahan, who owns a welding shop near the
intersection. "Staff has neglected to take a serious look at this
area. Until someone gets killed it doesn't get any attention."</LD>
<LD>   Linda Mary Brandon, 51, was hit by a Dodge pickup about 4:30 p.m.
Thursday as she crossed Ventura Avenue at a marked crosswalk, just
south of Warner Street. She died about an hour later, said Craig
Stevens, a senior county deputy medical examiner.</LD>
<TE>   The driver immediately fled. A short time later police arrested
Scott Ryan Ramirez, 26, and Jordan Pruss, 23, at Wagon Wheel Road in
Oxnard, Police Sgt. John Turner said</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez, who Turner said was driving, was booked on three felony
counts of gross vehicular manslaughter, hit-and-run with injury and
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   He is being held in lieu of $105,000 bail at Ventura County Jail.
Pruss was booked on suspicion of obstructing or resisting an officer.
He remains in custody on $10,000 bail, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Their arrests ended a day of drinking that began at a restaurant
bar at the Pacific View Mall where the men were later seen driving
recklessly in the parking lot, Turner said. They continued to a Main
Street bar where they had drinks and dented the hood of a parked car
as they left, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Turner said Brandon, a Ventura native, was walking westbound in
the Ventura Avenue crosswalk when she was hit by the truck. The
vehicle was traveling in excess of 40 mph, about 10 mph over the
speed limit, Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told investigators that several cars had stopped at the
crosswalk as Brandon walked onto the street. The pickup swerved into
a center left-turn lane before striking the woman, Turner said. The
impact threw Brandon about 30 feet onto the pavement, where she was
then run over by the truck, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Monahan said the area where Brandon was struck has been the site
of many accidents involving pedestrians. He plans to ask the council
at its Feb. 25 meeting to review traffic studies for Ventura Avenue
to determine whether a signal should be installed at the
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and workers in the neighborhood where Brandon was killed
agreed that traffic has become a major problem on the narrow main
thoroughfare and nearby side streets.</TE>
<TE>   "You could be standing right there waiting to cross and they don't
care, they will run you over," said Angel Benavente, a clerk at the
Red Barn Market who witnessed the accident. "There's been a lot of
accidents here."</TE>

<LD>The final battle is nearing in Glendale over a 572-home development
in the Verdugo Mountains above Oakmont County Club.</LD>
<LD>   On one side, an army of conservationists, environmentalists and
some homeowners are passing out fliers, decorating lawns with
anti-growth signs and firing off rallying e-mails.</LD>
<LD>   The other camp is made up of other homeowners, home seekers and
developers. The group is distributing brochures as the developers
show models depicting luxurious living and field hundreds of calls
from possible buyers.</LD>
<TE>   Within three weeks, the Glendale City Council will decide the fate
of the fifth and final phase of the Oakmont View V, a controversial
proposal that opponents and city officials have stalled for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   First, the five council members must wade through a four-volume
environmental report that Dave Bobardt, Glendale's senior planner,
said is 2,000 to 4,000 pages. It is the second version, written after
the City Council denounced the first one as lacking public comment.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental report released last week concluded that the
project would harm the air, wildlife and scenic vistas, but would not
significantly increase the city's population or require building
community facilities to accommodate growth.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) on Friday described the second
report as "flawed" and "astoundingly similar" to the original
version, claiming it should have done a better job addressing
community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Schiff is the author of proposed federal legislation calling for a
study to expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
to include the Verdugos. It would allow the Oakmont land to be used
as recreational space.</TE>
<TE>   "There really is little public support for a hillside development
of a massive housing project," Schiff said.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved spending $8 million toward the
purchase of the tract, but developer John L. Gregg said the land was
appraised at $46 million more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision on Oakmont is scheduled for March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg said on Friday that it was about time. His company, Gregg's
Artistic Homes, proposed the project in 1992, a year before Glendale
adopted a hillside law that would have limited the number of homes to
about 50.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg sued the city, ultimately agreeing to drop the lawsuit if
officials allowed the proposal to proceed under the earlier, less
restrictive ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Planning stalled until last year, when a Los Angeles judge ordered
Glendale to complete certification of the environmental impact report
by March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "The process won't be pleasant, but it's necessary," said Gregg,
who estimated that his company has spent more than $3.25 million on
environmental impact reports, legal fees, geology studies, biological
studies, engineering work and other expenses related to the Oakmont
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg argued that the housing plan would elevate Glendale's
quality of life, particularly for executives who work at Nestle USA,
DreamWorks SKG and other city businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Each month, Gregg said he receives dozens of calls from highly
paid workers who are tired of commuting from Westlake Village and the
Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not give them a nice house here?" Gregg asked. "Why not let
them buy $60,000 cars on Brand Boulevard so the city can use the
sales tax revenue?"</TE>

<LD>The final battle is nearing in Glendale over a 572-home development
in the Verdugo Mountains above Oakmont County Club.</LD>
<LD>   On one side, an army of conservationists, environmentalists and
some homeowners are passing out fliers, decorating lawns with
anti-growth signs and firing off rallying e-mails.</LD>
<LD>   The other camp is made up of other homeowners, home seekers and

<TE>   Within three weeks, the Glendale City Council will decide the fate
of the final phase of the Oakmont View V, a controversial proposal
that opponents and city officials have stalled for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the biggest decisions the council is facing in the
last 100 years," Glendale Mayor Gus Gomez said Friday. "There is
pressure from all sides."</TE>
<TE>   But first, the five council members must wade through a
four-volume environmental report, which Dave Bobardt, Glendale's
senior planner, said is 2,000 to 4,000 pages long.</TE>
<TE>   The report is a second version, written after the City Council
denounced the first one as lacking public comment.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental report released last week by Jones &amp; Stokes, an
Irvine-based consulting firm, concluded that the project would harm
the air, wildlife and scenic vistas. But it said the development
would not significantly increase the city's population or require
building community facilities to accommodate growth. It also examined
alternatives to the development, including building fewer homes. Rep.
Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) on Friday described the second report as
"flawed" and "astoundingly similar" to the original version, claiming
it should have done a better job addressing community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Many, including Schiff, oppose development of Oakmont's pristine
woodlands--graced with oak and sycamore trees, acorn woodpeckers,
deer and other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Schiff is the author of proposed federal legislation calling for a
study to expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
to include the Verdugos. It would allow the Oakmont land to be used
as recreational space.</TE>
<TE>   "There really is little public support for a hillside development
of a massive housing project," Schiff said.</TE>
<TE>   Previous Oakmont phases produced bulging, three-story mansions on
the hillside, often just 10 feet apart. However, developer John L.
Gregg said his company only sold the lots and did not build those
homes.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved $8 million toward the purchase of
the Oakmont tract. Gregg said the land was appraised at $46 million
more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Council members also will listen to several rounds of public
hearings, including a 6 p.m. Planning Commission meeting on Feb. 27
that is expected to pack the Glendale Civic Auditorium with thousands
of proponents and opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision on Oakmont is scheduled for March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg said on Friday that it was about time. His company, Gregg's
Artistic Homes, proposed the project in 1992, a year before Glendale
adopted a hillside law that would have limited the number of homes to
about 50.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg sued the city, ultimately agreeing to drop the lawsuit if
officials allowed the proposal to proceed under the earlier, less
restrictive ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Planning stalled until last year, when a Los Angeles judge ordered
Glendale to complete certification of the environmental impact report
by March 15.</TE>
<TE>   "The process won't be pleasant, but it's necessary," said Gregg.
He estimated that his company has spent more than $3.25 million on
environmental impact reports, legal fees, geology studies, biological
studies, engineering work and other expenses related to the Oakmont
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg argued that the housing plan would elevate Glendale's
quality of life, particularly for executives who work at Nestle USA,
DreamWorks SKG and other city businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Each month, Gregg said he receives dozens of calls from highly
paid workers who are tired of commuting from Westlake Village, Rancho
Cucamonga and the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not give them a nice house here?" Gregg asked. "Why not let
them buy $60,000 cars on Brand Boulevard so the city can use the
sales tax revenue?</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, they're jamming the freeways and polluting the air."</TE>
<TE>   No matter the outcome, Volunteers Organized In Conserving the
Environment will fight the development.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my fingers crossed that all will go well," said Marc
Stirdivant, president of the Glendale citizens group with 5,000
members. "But we are prepared for all possibilities."</TE>

<HD>Exiting Their Stretch of the Freeway of Life, There's
Nothing but a Dead End</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think that L.A.'s freeways would put the fear of God in most
everyone. But a colleague notes that a sign on the Glendale Freeway
indicates that one stretch is sponsored by United Atheists.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of souls: Allen St. James of Ventura visited a gym that
apparently won't admit any callous or unfeeling folks (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Unfeeling (cont.): Bill Robinson of San Diego noticed that one
jewelry store will apparently take a pound of flesh in payment (see
accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Such a deal: In our section for questionable bargains, J.S.
Brattain of Gardena found some concrete that was pretty pricey, while
Helen Whitaker of Pacific Palisades spotted some admittedly dull gift
cards (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Musical duels: The Laguna Niguel police log item about the man
"who was sitting in a parked vehicle listening to very loud Italian
opera" struck a chord with Sharron Kenty of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I am subjected to obnoxious, loud car radios playing rap
or heavy metal while stopped in traffic," she said, "I put in a tape
of really screechy operatic arias or some really vigorous and
energetic orchestra music and blast away with the windows open.
('Ride of the Valkyries' is a good one.)"</TE>
<TE>   Kenty said she's not sure whether the offending parties hear her
but she feels better.</TE>
<TE>   Hannibal on the loose in San Pedro: Sir Anthony Hopkins, shooting
a scene for his latest Hannibal Lecter movie, escaped the set the
other day to chat with residents of a recovery facility he spotted
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Art Vinsel said Hopkins' handlers shouted for him to stay.
But the actor, who has spoken of his past drinking problems,
explained: "I see some recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Visiting Beacon House, he signed autographs (as "Tony Hopkins")
and discussed the subject of sobriety with the residents.</TE>
<TE>   Someone--"inevitably," as Vinsel put it--asked Hopkins if he was
hungry. "What's on the menu?" he quipped in the fashion of the
cinematic cannibal he portrays.</TE>
<TE>   One resident remarked that Sir Anthony, with his modest wardrobe,
fit in with the Beacon House residents. Of course, as Vinsel pointed
out, Hopkins was dressed for his movie role, "clad in T-shirt
stenciled with jail serial numbers over a loose, floppy pair of
old-fashioned, beltless pants."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Here's a new gift idea for Sharon Stone. You'll recall
that last year the actress anted up for a special in-cage visit for
her husband, editor Phil Bronstein, with a Komodo dragon at the L.A.
Zoo. Unfortunately, the dragon mistook Bronstein's foot for a snack.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is offering
folks the chance to participate in a feeding and training session
with Miller, a 600-pound sea lion. Cost: $75.</TE>
<TE>   The aquarium says Miller is "lovable." I have no reason to doubt
that, although I used to have an editor named Miller who would bite
my head off.</TE>

<LD>   He also helped revolutionize the center-forward position, moving
it deep out of the mouth of the goal and acting more like an
attacking center-half.</LD>
<TE>   Following Hidegkuti's example, teams began to change their tactics
to emulate the Hungarian formation, with many of them playing with
deep-lying center-forwards, or at least forwards who did not play
rigidly in one area of the field as they had before.</TE>
<TE>   Hidegkuti turned to coaching after he quit playing, leading
Italy's Fiorentina to the European Cup title in 1961.</TE>

<LD>Brig. Gen. Ke Pauk, 72, a former Khmer Rouge military officer who led
bloody purges during the Khmer Rouge's 1975-79 rule, died Friday of
liver disease in Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The deputy commander in chief of the army, Lt. Gen. Meas Sophea,
said Ke Pauk, who joined the Cambodian army after leaving the Khmer
Rouge in 1998, had ''recently suffered a partial stroke.''</LD>
<LD>   Ke Pauk was remembered for leading bloody purges in northern and
eastern Cambodia. More than 1.7 million people died of starvation,
diseases, execution and overwork under the Khmer Rouge.</LD>
<TE>   ''He was deeply and directly involved in every wave of mass
killings,'' said Steve Heder, a fellow at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum and longtime scholar of the Khmer Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   After the radical Communists were toppled in 1979 by an invading
Vietnamese army, Ke Pauk fought alongside Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot
in the group's guerrilla war against the Vietnamese-installed
government.</TE>

<HD>Wally Potts, 83; Pioneering Diver, Spear Fisherman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He began diving in the ocean off La Jolla in the 1930s before scuba
tanks, face masks and swim fins and at a time when lobsters, abalone
and sea bass were bountiful along Southern California shores.</LD>
<LD>   As a pioneer of modern free diving and a prolific innovator of
spearfishing gear, Wally Potts preferred to use only his own lung
power to dive deep under the sea.</LD>
<LD>   Potts, who set world records for spearing and landing large game
fish, designed mechanisms that are key parts of the modern spear gun
and served as a mentor to generations of watermen, died Feb. 5 in La
Jolla of complications from diabetes. He was 83.</LD>
<TE>   "He was a true pioneer," said Eric Hanauer, who interviewed Potts
for his 1994 book "Diving Pioneers" and included Potts in an exhibit
he curated on early divers, now on display at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   "Wally was a world-renowned free diver and spear fisherman at a
time when it was politically correct to shoot big fish," Hanauer
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Potts became the first diver to land a fish weighing more
than 100 pounds, a 110-pound gulf grouper taken in the waters off La
Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, he speared a giant black sea bass off the Coronado
Islands in Mexico that weighed 4011/2 pounds, a world record that
held for the next six years.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph of the barrel-chested Potts landing the giant sea
bass appeared in the fifth issue of Sports Illustrated in 1954, the
first underwater picture the magazine ran.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the legends," said diving historian Jim Cahill, a
friend who wrote a profile of Potts for Hawaii Skin Diver magazine
two years ago. "It's like if you grow up in Hawaii and you hear about
Duke Kahanamoku, the great legendary surfer. That's kind of what
Wally was here in San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   An early member of the San Diego Bottom Scratchers--one of the
world's first organized dive clubs--Potts worked with his close
friend and fellow Bottom Scratcher Jack Prodanovich to produce
innovative spearfishing and diving gear.</TE>
<TE>   After face masks were introduced by Japanese producers in the late
1930s, Potts and Prodanovich redesigned the mask using a metal rim,
softer rubber and a custom-contoured fit.</TE>
<TE>   After a crude spear gun was introduced in the early '40s from
Europe, the two men found it underpowered and inadequate for larger
fish, Cahill said. So they improved upon it by changing the hardware
and the power of the rubber bands.</TE>
<TE>   Prolific Innovator of Spearfishing Gear</TE>
<TE>   They also devised a smoother, more secure two-part trigger
mechanism that is still used in spear guns today. And they created
the Potts Reel, an improved plastic reel on the spear that provided
better control of a fish during the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Potts and Prodanovich also produced the first underwater camera
housing, fashioned of cast aluminum from a handmade mold.</TE>
<TE>   Cameraman Lamar Boren, a Bottom Scratcher who shot underwater
scenes for the TV series "Sea Hunt" and "Flipper," as well as several
James Bond movies, modeled his first housing on those designed by
Potts and Prodanovich, said Cahill.</TE>
<TE>   Prodanovich said he and Potts always worked as a team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd come up with an idea and Wally would pick it apart, and then
he'd come up with an idea and I'd look at it," he said. "We'd pick
each other's stuff apart and come up with a real solution for it."</TE>
<TE>   Potts was also a wood craftsman, creating spear guns that were a
unique blend of machined stainless steel hardware and heirloom
quality hardwood stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The custom spear guns, which Potts made only for friends and local
divers out of his Point Loma garage workshop, are now considered
collectors' items.</TE>
<TE>   Although they supplied a tight circle of fellow divers with their
improved gear, neither Potts nor Prodanovich went commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "If you open a shop, you've got to deal with the public, and
that's a poor thing to have to do," Potts told Cahill. "Besides, if
you're running a store, you ain't in the water!"</TE>
<TE>   And he added, "Any time there was clear water, we were in it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Lorborne, Canada, in 1918, Potts moved to San Diego with
his family at age 8. Forced to quit school at 16 during the
Depression, he worked a variety of jobs--cannery worker, field hand
and lumberjack--throughout California and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But by the late '30s, Potts was back in San Diego, where he
renewed his love of swimming.</TE>
<TE>   He had learned to swim in a tide pool below Sunset Cliffs on Point
Loma at age 8 and became known for regularly swimming in deep water
out beyond the kelp.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, Potts was invited to become the sixth member of the elite
San Diego Bottom Scratchers dive club, which had been formed six
years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Nicknamed 'One Long Dive'</TE>
<TE>   Potts became known for his ability to endure long dives in cold
water, holding his breath for at least three minutes and earning the
club nickname "One Long Dive."</TE>
<TE>   Potts shunned not only scuba tanks but also wetsuits, which he
called rubber shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for that stuff, 99% of guys wouldn't be in the
water, simply because they didn't believe they could do what we were
doing," he said in a 1999 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill said Potts "pushed the limits in terms of depths." One
memorable time off La Jolla, he dove so deep and so long while
fighting a fish that he passed out and Prodanovich had to revive him.</TE>
<TE>   Potts, a manufacturing engineer, worked for Solar Aircraft Co. in
San Diego before and during World War II and was with the company,
later named Solar Turbines, for 41 years. He retired in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Bottom Scratchers, Potts became a pioneer in
ocean conservation. The club was, for example, instrumental in
getting a state law passed in the late '50s that protects the
broomtail grouper.</TE>
<TE>   In the early years, Cahill said, "a lot of the guys went in [the
ocean] and said, 'What a bounty!' But as the sport changed and they
matured, they saw the impact of mechanized forms of fishing and the
threat it posed to the health of the fish stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Potts, Cahill said, "worked to try to set limits on the take of
the more factory, or mechanized, approaches to fishing. He advocated
a small-scale approach, an ethic articulated by some as 'one man, one
fish, one day.'"</TE>
<TE>   Like many who spend a lot of time in the water, Potts became hard
of hearing. He stopped diving sometime in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But over the years, a constant stream of surfers, lifeguards,
fishermen and divers continued to make pilgrimages to Potts' garage
to discuss equipment and diving. Cahill was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Lauded as an 'Old Chief of the Water'</TE>
<TE>   "The image I always got was of the young Hawaiian warriors sort of
sitting around the canoe house and talking about the old days," said
Cahill. "If watermen are a coastal tribe, I'd say Wally was kind of
one of the old chiefs of the water."</TE>
<TE>   Potts is survived by his wife of 62 years, Vi; daughter Lynda
Manganelli of La Jolla; son Michael of San Diego; two grandchildren;
and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Donations may be made to the Wally Potts Memorial Fund, which will
benefit a sport diving exhibit at the Hall of Champions in San
Diego's Balboa Park and fund research for the history of skin diving
in San Diego and marine conservation efforts. For information, call
Keir Fitzgerald of the Bank of America at (858) 654-6529.</TE>

<HD>Camarillo High Teacher Charged in Sex Case Released on Bail</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect is ordered to stay away from alleged
victims, campus, students' homes and school events. Passport also
revoked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Camarillo High School teacher accused of committing sex crimes
against nine male students was released from Ventura County Jail on
bail Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen posted a $250,000 bond and was released,
jail officials said.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, in a courtroom packed with more than 50 supportive
parents, students and teachers, a judge denied a bid by Pridgen's
attorneys to lower the bail amount to $50,000.</LD>
<TE>   A protective order issued Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Roland
Purnell prohibits Pridgen from communicating with any of the alleged
victims, all of whom are current or former students at Camarillo High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley said the order also requires the
science teacher and tennis coach to stay away from the high school
campus, the homes of any students attending the school or any other
school event where Camarillo High students may be present.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen is further prohibited from having contact with anyone
under the age of 18 other than his own 8-year-old son, Ridley said,
and his passport has been revoked to ensure that he does not leave
the country.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone in the community sees Mr. Pridgen having contact with
any minor children or violating any terms of this protective order,
they should contact the Sheriff's Department immediately," Ridley
said.</TE>
<TE>   Violating the order could cause Pridgen's bail to be revoked,
Ridley said, and additional charges could be filed.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher faces 33 felony and misdemeanor counts alleging that
he gave alcohol to, tried to seduce or had sexual relations with
students between September 2000 and his arrest Feb. 5.</TE>
<TE>   At least two of the victims were forced to perform oral sex either
on Pridgen or another student, according to the district attorney's
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on any of the charges, Pridgen could face up to 30
years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Union High School District officials have placed Pridgen on
unpaid leave from his post at the Camarillo campus, effective Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Rice, an assistant superintendent, said the state education
code prohibits teachers charged with serious sex offenses from
collecting paychecks until the outcome of their trials.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's four Advanced Placement courses have been assigned to a
substitute teacher, and the district is seeking a temporary
replacement with expertise in high school chemistry or environmental
science, Rice said.</TE>

<LD>The first rain in what normally is Southern California's wettest
month is expected on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "As winter storms go, it's a light one, but after how dry it's
been, at least there should be a little precipitation," said National
Weather Service meteorologist Bruce Rockwell.</LD>
<LD>   Rockwell said the Pacific storm should move into the Los Angeles
area before dawn Sunday, with about a quarter of an inch of rain in
the valleys and a little more than that in the foothills before skies
start clearing Sunday night.</LD>
<TE>   Several inches of snow are expected in mountains above 6,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Skies should be partly cloudy on the Presidents Day holiday, with
more rain and snow possible toward the end of next week.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures throughout the weekend should be a little cooler than
normal, with valley and downtown highs near 60, following overnight
lows mostly in the 40s and 50s.</TE>
<TE>   Total rainfall since July 1 is 3.66 inches, compared with a normal
total for the same period of 8.95 inches.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Mayor Seeks More Study on Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Friday raised new concerns to the
agency studying the secession proposals for the San Fernando Valley
and harbor area, saying it must expand the scope of environmental
impact reports that are already underway.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local
Agency Formation Commission of Los Angeles County, Hahn said that the
reports being prepared by a LAFCO consultant must look at secession's
impact not just on the breakaway areas, but on what would remain of
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   He said the reports also should examine other scenarios, including
those that fall short of secession. In one such scenario, Los Angeles
would restructure its government to address the secessionists'
complaints. Another would involve smaller seceding areas. The mayor
also said that effects on land use and planning must be explored,
because regional facilities such as power or water treatment plants
could be in trouble if, due to secession, they were not maintained or
allowed to expand.</LD>
<TE>   Secessionists said the mayor's new concerns are only another
delaying tactic, aimed at keeping secession off the ballot. LAFCO
will decide in the spring whether to put harbor and Valley breakaway
proposals to a citywide vote in November. The agency also is
reviewing a secession proposal for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is obviously trying to delay this," said Richard Close,
chairman of Valley VOTE, the leading group advocating for secession.
"Apparently, he's afraid to let the people of the Valley vote on this
issue on Nov. 5."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Mayor Felipe Fuentes said Hahn simply wants LAFCO to
address all important questions while framing the scope of the
environmental reports. The City Council voted unanimously Friday to
send the letter to Calemine. Although the scope of the reports still
could be expanded, the consultant, LSA Associates Inc., already has
started to study key issues such as traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine would not comment on the letter, which he said he had yet
to receive, or on whether the mayor's requests might cause delays.
"All I can say is, we expect the EIR [environmental impact report] to
be very broad in scope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes said the reports should look at a range of potential
socioeconomic effects, such as job losses if a company in one of the
new cities relocated, or harm to the environment if a new Valley city
closed a landfill and people had to drive long distances to dump
trash.</TE>
<TE>   He said the city doesn't expect LAFCO to come up with every
possible scenario, just to think more broadly.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that the mayor's letter was only 21/2 pages long.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying in a 900-page letter that we want all the gory
details. We are just expressing some concerns," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Close said that supporters of secession believe LAFCO is
conducting its studies fairly.</TE>
<TE>   "LAFCO's consultant is doing his limited review. What the city's
trying to do is to make the limited review a massive review so it
can't be done in sufficient time for a vote," Close said.</TE>

<HD>5 Agencies Submit Plans for Desalination Plants</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign of renewed interest in tapping the Pacific Ocean for
drinking water, five water agencies submitted plans to build
desalination plants.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California solicited
the proposals as a way to expand the region's water supplies.
Metropolitan sells water to dozens of cities and districts serving 17
million people.</LD>
<LD>   Proposals were submitted by the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, the city of Long Beach, the San Diego County Water
Authority, the Municipal Water District of Orange County and the West
Basin Municipal Water District.</LD>
<TE>   If built, the proposed plants could provide enough water to supply
260,000 families for a year. The MWD will study the plans and ask for
more detailed documents in June, said water resource manager Stephen
N. Arakawa.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few, small desalination plants have been built on
California's coast.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say new technology makes desalination more practical,
and they have offered to subsidize new plants.</TE>

<DH>Law: Storied barbecomes home base of defense fund for man
accused of threatening to kill two at nuclear plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The half-full collection jar sits behind the bar, growing slowly--a
quarter here, a buck there. Sometimes a patron feels particularly
generous and tosses in a five spot.</LD>
<LD>   In a tavern where locals gather for weddings, wakes or just to
chew on the issues of the day, it doesn't strike anyone as odd that
the Swallows Inn would be home base to the David Lee Reza Defense
Fund.</LD>
<LD>   A gun collector and a former employee at the San Onofre Nuclear
Power Plant, Reza was arrested last month on suspicion of threatening
to kill two co-workers at the plant. He's also accused of possessing
cocaine and having a stockpile of illegal weapons--military-style
guns, tear gas, rocket launchers, tracer ammunition and metal
knuckles.</LD>
<TE>   Though free on $100,000 bail, Reza has been ordered to stay away
from the nuclear plant and Swallows, where, indeed, everyone seems to
know his name.</TE>
<TE>   The Swallows is that kind of place, a safe harbor for local
characters. But in Reza, the tavern regulars have taken under wing a
man facing six years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Located within eyeshot of San Juan's historic mission, the
Swallows is an unofficial town hall. The clientele includes city
politicians, Harley bikers and local ranchers. The bar stools are
usually filled by midmorning.</TE>
<TE>   The tavern has a sawdust-covered, wood-plank floor with battered
license plates and street signs on the cluttered walls and faded
posters plastered to the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, the City Council would routinely recess to the
Swallows after finishing the town's business. A scene from the Clint
Eastwood movie ''Heartbreak Ridge" was filmed in the tavern.
Old-timers recall riding their horses through the bar when it was
across the street and the town was a lot less crowded.</TE>
<TE>   The Swallows' controversies are as colorful as its patrons.</TE>
<TE>   When the organizers of the Hairiest Man Contest suggested the
Swallows was a little too honky-tonk for their annual event some
years back, regulars erupted at the idea of having the contest moved
to the nearby El Adobe restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   As the bar's owner put it, the idea went over like "prune juice in
the beer." The contest remained at the tavern and the organizer who
proposed moving the event apologized for ever thinking it belonged
anywhere but the Swallows.</TE>
<TE>   So when the local gun collector was arrested on suspicion of
making death threats, the collection jar came out. And, court costs
being what they are, the tavern hosted a $15-a-plate fund-raiser on
Reza's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred people turned out and Reza got the court's permission
to attend the gathering, along with his lawyer, his girlfriend and
his mother and father.</TE>
<TE>   "The way our legal system works, it's expensive whether you're
innocent or guilty," said Steve Nordeck, surveying his crowded tavern
on a recent morning. "When somebody's down, I'd want people to step
in and help, especially in this case, when that person is unjustly
charged."</TE>
<TE>   "He's been railroaded," said Danny Perez, taking a swig from a
long-neck bottle of beer. "They're trying to make something out of
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Reza is family here. He was a bouncer at the tavern and has been a
regular for a decade. He's a member of the committee that puts on the
town's annual Swallows Day Parade. Allison Chard found it hard to
believe he could be guilty."When he was a bouncer here, he'd always
walk me to my car," said Chard, who had just finished her shift at a
local hospital. "He was always very polite and kind. He once helped
pay for my books while I was in nursing school."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Perez, a bartender, said most of his patrons are loyal to Reza
because they could see themselves winding up in the same boat.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think this could have happened to anybody," Perez
said. "That's what is so scary about this. All he wanted was a check
from his bosses. Having a dispute with your boss is a long way from
making national headlines."</TE>
<TE>   Reza was arrested after allegedly telling a former co-worker at
the nuclear plant that he was "going to take my guns, go to San
Onofre and whack some people." Police said a search of Reza's house
and a rented storage facility turned up more than 280 weapons, some
illegal assault weapons and other banned items.</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt T. Hart, a San Juan Capistrano councilman and a former
captain with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, is among Reza's
supporters, though he said he understands why his friend was
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody pictures Dave as being a terrorist, and I
think things were blown out of proportion," said Hart. "However in
light of 9/11, the Sheriff's Department had to take immediate action,
and I support what they did. I have full confidence that the criminal
justice system will sort everything out."</TE>

time," he said. "When you add everything up, that he got angry at
people who worked at a nuclear power plant, that he was a gun
collector and that this happened shortly after 9/11, it looks worse
than it is."</TE>
<TE>   At the Swallow's Inn, Reza's a perfect fit, Nordeck said. "We have
people from all walks of life come in here," Nordeck said. "But once
you're in here, everybody's on the same level, the richest talking to
the poorest."</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt T. Hart, a San Juan Capistrano councilman and a former
captain with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, is among Reza's
supporters, though he said he understands why his friend was
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody pictures Dave as being a terrorist, and I
think things were blown out of proportion," said Hart, who
occasionally sought Reza's advice about the value of his own gun
collection.</TE>
<TE>   "However, in light of 9/11, the Sheriff's Department had to take
immediate action, and I support what they did. I have full confidence
that the criminal justice system will sort everything out."</TE>
<TE>   Until Reza has his day in court, Nordeck figures his customers
will keep dropping their hard-earned money into the canister. "We're
in his corner," Nordeck said. "We'll be there until the matter is
decided and put to bed."</TE>

<HD>Thomas Trapnell, 99; Bataan Hero, Military Advisor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas J.H. Trapnell, a highly decorated Army lieutenant general who
survived the Bataan Death March during World War II and was a top
American advisor to the French in the final stages of their colonial
war in Vietnam, has died. He was 99.</LD>
<LD>   Trapnell, who retired in 1962 as commander of the 3rd U.S. Army,
died Wednesday of a heart ailment at the Fairfax retirement facility
at Ft. Belvoir, Va.</LD>
<LD>   His decorations included the Army's Distinguished Service Cross,
the second-highest award for valor after the Medal of Honor. He was
awarded the service cross in January 1942, a month after commanding a
rear-guard cavalry unit in the Philippines that was enduring intense
enemy gunfire as it withdrew to the Bataan Peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   Trapnell, then a major, commandeered a medical truck and set it
afire on a bridge to delay the Japanese advance. "He waited under
fire until the bridge was in flames before leaving the scene in a
scout car," the citation read. "He then retired slowly with the rear
elements of his organization [and] picked up wounded soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the Army forces in the
Philippines, called Trapnell's actions an example of "extraordinary
heroism" that "set an inspiring example to his entire regiment."</TE>
<TE>   Along with more than 70,000 other U.S. and Filipino soldiers,
Trapnell was taken prisoner by the Japanese when enemy forces overran
the Bataan Peninsula in April 1942. He was marched to a camp dozens
of miles away, deprived of water, food and rest, and endured almost
three years of foul conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1944, he was among 1,600 American prisoners being
transported on the Japanese ship Oryoku Maru when U.S. Navy dive
bombers accidentally sank the ship. Trapnell survived but was on the
Enoura Maru, which also was sunk by American dive bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Only 300 survived the two sinkings. A third ship, the Brazil Maru,
successfully made the run to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1945, Russian troops liberated the American prisoners in
Manchuria.</TE>
<TE>   The hale, athletic 6-footer--once described as "the warhorse of
the West Point backfield" when he played on the U.S. Military Academy
football team--weighed less than 100 pounds at war's end.</TE>
<TE>   Trapnell was promoted to general in 1951 and became commander of
the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. The next year, he was
called on to help overcome a rebellion of more than 80,000 North
Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Korea's Koje Do Island.
Communist leaders had goaded the prisoners into rioting, threatening
truce negotiations and leading to the death of one American and more
than 40 prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   From 1952 to 1954, Trapnell was chief of the U.S. Military Mission
to Vietnam. He sent reports back to Washington stating that the
French would not prevail in the conflict against Communist forces. He
left Dien Bien Phu shortly before the Vietnamese victory over the
French.</TE>
<TE>   President John F. Kennedy sent Trapnell back to Southeast Asia in
1961, and his analysis echoed his earlier refrain about the
French--that continued U.S. military involvement was inadvisable.</TE>
<TE>   Trapnell held several command positions during the 1950s and early
1960s, including the 82nd Airborne Division, the I Corps in Korea and
the Strategic Army Corps, a highly mobile force commonly called
STRAC.</TE>
<TE>   While STRAC commander in 1960, he lobbied intensely for an
integrated Army-Navy-Air Force reaction force that later was
implemented as Strike Command.</TE>
<TE>   Trapnell settled in the Washington area after retiring from his
final active-duty position, commanding the 3rd U.S. Army at Ft.
McPherson in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Distinguished Service Cross, he was a recipient of the
Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Silver Star and three
awards of the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star and Purple Heart.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas John Hall Trapnell was a native of Yonkers, N.Y., and a
1923 graduate of Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., where he

<HD>Jurists Back Man Jailed by Police Who Thought He Was His
Twin</HD>
<DH>Law: A federal panel upholds verdict against Long Beach,
saying officers who held him 12 days violated his rights by not even
trying to verify his identity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John B. Fairley kept telling Long Beach police he was not the one
they wanted. The warrants were for his identical twin brother, Joe,
not him.</LD>
<LD>   But police jailed him for nearly two weeks, never bothering to
check his fingerprints, even though they knew Fairley did indeed have
a twin.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, a federal appeals court agreed that Long Beach had
violated Fairley's constitutional rights, upholding a lower court
jury verdict against the city.</LD>
<TE>   "Neither a fingerprint comparison nor Department of Motor Vehicles
check was completed at any time during John's 12-day detention,"
noted a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
"Either would have immediately alerted the city it had the wrong
man."</TE>
<TE>   Fairley, 36, was arrested in April 1997 after arguing with his
Long Beach neighbor, who said he had a restraining order against
Fairley.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out there was no such order. But Long Beach police
continued to hold Fairley on warrants for two citations issued
against Joe B. Fairley, his twin, who was similar in height but
weighed at least 60 pounds more.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'That's my twin brother. I'm John. He's Joe,'" recalled
Fairley's attorney, Robert Mann of Los Angeles. "They appear to have
taken the attitude they didn't need to do anything to determine if
they had the right guy because John Fairley was close enough to Joe
for government work."</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach city attorney could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mann said Fairley also filed a claim against Los Angeles County
because he was held in the County Jail for most of the 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   That claim was included among five class-action suits settled last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The suits accused the county of keeping inmates too long,
strip-searching them and holding the wrong people on warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Fairley, who is disabled from a work-related shoulder injury, was
awarded compensatory damages of $11,250, plus attorney fees.</TE>

<LD>The pressure is on again for Alpine skier Daron Rahlves of Truckee,
Calif., heading into today's super-giant slalom. Rahlves established
himself as world class last year, when he stunned the European stars,
especially Austrians Stephan Eberharter and Fritz Strobl, by winning
the super-G world title in St. Anton, Austria.</LD>
<LD>   In the Olympic downhill last weekend, Strobl took the gold and
Eberharter the bronze; Rahlves was 16th. Eberharter and Strobl say
they still owe Rahlves for taking the world title in their backyard.
"Maybe I can take away the gold from him this year," Eberharter said.</LD>
<LD>   Rahlves called himself the underdog, although he is not without
medal aspirations.</LD>
<TE>   "This would definitely be the best place to have the race of my
life," he said.</TE>

<DH>Canadians delight in the turn of events that gives their
figure skating stars a gold medal and popular support in U.S.</DH>

<LD>Not surprisingly, Canadians everywhere reacted with jubilation to the
news that pairs figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were
given a second gold medal at the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The Toronto City Council interrupted its meeting Friday with a
spontaneous outburst of applause at the news, and Sale's tiny home
town of Red Deer began planning a post-Olympics celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy, congratulations to both of them, and hallelujah," said
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who was by coincidence on a visit to
Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Like most Canadians, from ordinary citizens to high officials to
the skaters themselves, Chretien took pains to refrain from any
criticism of the Russian gold medal winners.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials said privately they were surprised and
delighted by the overwhelming popular support for their figure
skating stars in the United States, a turn of events that in their
view already had compensated for the loss of a pair of gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   "This was really a case of serendipity for us," a senior Canadian
official said. "If they had won the gold medals to begin with, it
would have been a one-day wonder outside Canada. But this way they
were in the spotlight day after day, and so was Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Canadians in Salt Lake City were delighted as well.</TE>
<TE>   Walking briskly past the Mormon Tabernacle with three other young
female missionaries in long black coats, Sister Camilla Whatley
expressed the dominant feeling: "I was, like: Of course they got the
gold. Of course!"</TE>
<TE>   At the Canadian hospitality center downtown, a large storefront
decked out with signs that say "Bonne Chance! Go Canada!", jubilation
erupted as Canadian tourists and Olympics volunteers heard the news.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pandemonium, absolute pandemonium," said Lisa Osachoff,
who works next door selling maple-leaf emblazoned hats and "Oh,
Canada" sweatshirts.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is so happy--and it's great they didn't take the medals
from the Russians," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Pothier and his two-man luge teammate had heard about the
decision just after placing fifth--the best ever for Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few days have been unbelievable," he said. "We had
people we didn't know walking up to us on the streets of Park City,
saying 'I'm sorry.'"</TE>
<TE>   The figure-skating controversy completely dominated Canada's news
media over the last few days, but the Winter Olympics almost
invariably dominate Canadian news.</TE>
<TE>   Canadians take these Games seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of a goalie for the Olympic hockey team, announced
Friday, was the subject of fevered national speculation akin to the
Boston media's obsessions with the New England Patriots' choice for
starting quarterback in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But as a nation of skaters--in the way that Austria is a nation of
skiers and Australia a nation of swimmers--Canada devotes its most
acute attention to any event involving ice.</TE>
<TE>   There had been widespread disappointment over the paucity of
medals won by Canadian athletes in the Games so far.</TE>
<TE>   The gloom had begun to lift with the gold medal Thursday by
speedskater Catriona LeMay Doan.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier now have joined the list of Canadian athletes
who have transcended sports to become national heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "The love we have felt from Canadians from coast to coast has been
just wonderful," Pelletier said in a CBC broadcast after the medal
announcement Friday.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Wins Pursuit of Medal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>In a place with all that snow, you would think someone would have
cross-country skied faster in 78 years. On a day at Soldier Hollow
when the sport never seemed more exciting, Beckie Scott, 27, of
Canmore, Canada, not only did something no other Canadian has done,
but by earning an Olympic bronze medal in Friday's women's pursuit,
she won only the second cross-country skiing medal ever by a North
American. And in a photo finish too.</LD>
<LD>   The only other time any skier from Canada or the United States won
a medal was 1976, when American Bill Koch took silver in the 30k.</LD>
<LD>   Scott's American connections go deeper than that--her boyfriend is
U.S. Olympian Justin Wadsworth, and she and Canadian teammates
trained extensively here to get used to the 5,600-foot altitude on
the hilly course.</LD>
<TE>   "We decided we're not going to be mediocre anymore," Scott said.
"I'm comfortable with the altitude. I'm comfortable with the
terrain."</TE>
<TE>   And now she's comfortable with the awards podium.</TE>
<TE>   The setting and racing were spectacular before 13,406 fans on
another sun-splashed day that makes the 2002 Winter Olympics seem
more like a spring Olympics. It was no surprise that Russian women,
Olga Danilova, 31, and Larissa Lazutina, 36, took gold and silver,
respectively, though Lazutina, who won her ninth Olympic medal, had
been a better bet.</TE>
<TE>   To say that North American cross-country fans had never seen
anything like this was true in more than one sense. Crowds such as
this--screaming and swinging cowbells--are unprecedented outside
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "On the last hill, everyone was chanting, 'Nina! Nina!'" said top
American Nina Kemppel, who placed 27th.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuit itself is a little-known discipline. At 9 a.m., 73
starters left the stadium at 30-second intervals to ski five
kilometers in classical style over a rugged course. The top 50
finishers then had less than two hours' rest before skiing five
kilometers in the skate style. This time they left in bunches, in the
order of the morning result, separated by their finish times. A
full-fledged chase.</TE>
<TE>   Fans couldn't cheer fast enough when names were announced. The
World Cup circuit is planning an experimental pursuit in Sweden in a
couple of weeks, eliminating the rest period altogether. Racers will
finish, change boots from classical to skate style, and take off.</TE>
<TE>   "Duathlon style," Kemppel said. "I'm all for it. Let's make it
even more exciting."</TE>
<TE>   All four Americans who raced--Kemppel, Wendy Wagner, Aelin
Peterson and Kikkan Randall--are from Alaska, making the sparsely
populated state a country unto itself Friday. Only Kemppel and Wagner
(50th) advanced to the final.</TE>
<TE>   Soldier Hollow is picturesque, located in a bowl in the Wasatch
Mountains, but it is not benign terrain. "It's one of the most
challenging courses I've seen," Wagner said. "There are other courses
comparable, but they're at sea level."</TE>
<TE>   Danilova and Lazutina finished the first 5k in a virtual dead
heat. Scott was sixth. But the Russians broke from the pack on the
hills in the second race. Lazutina, who called the pursuit "the most
difficult" cross-country race, tried to shadow Danilova, another
accomplished veteran. Danilova said she was trying to conserve
strength, but approaching the stadium, knew "I had to risk it." She
opened daylight on Lazutina and won in a combined time of 24 minutes,
52.1 seconds, 6.9 seconds ahead of Lazutina.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, whose best finish in four individual events in the 1998
Games in Nagano was 45th, approached the finish in a pack of seven.
She dug deepest. In the mad sprint for the line, she edged Katerina
Neumannova of the Czech Republic by 0.1, and less than seven seconds
separated bronze from ninth place.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been 10 years in the making," Scott said. "It means so
much for our sport and our country. I'd like to think a lot of people
can share in this medal. It means the world."</TE>
<TE>   And Friday, the world was watching.</TE>

<HD>Czechs Cash In on Jagr's Birthday</HD>
<DH>Defending champions beat Germany, 8-2, as the star scorer
gets two goals and a couple of assists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVO, Utah</DL>
<LD>Germany, the surprise qualifier of the Olympic hockey tournament,
learned two things about the defending champion Czech Republic at the
Peaks Ice Arena here Friday night:</LD>
<LD>   * Don't play Jaromir Jagr on his birthday.</LD>
<LD>   * Don't give the Czechs any power plays.</LD>
<TE>   The Germans, who had sailed into the final round with qualifying
victories over Slovakia, Austria and Latvia, couldn't have been
knocked any flatter by the Zamboni than they were by the Czechs, who
scored early and often in their Olympic opener, a rousing 8-2 success
in Group C.</TE>
<TE>   Jagr, the five-time NHL scoring champion who has been having a
so-so season with the Washington Capitals, looked very much like his
old self as he turned 30, scoring twice and getting a couple of
assists.</TE>
<TE>   And goalie Dominik Hasek, who powered the Czechs to their
surprising triumph in Nagano, blanking Canada in their semifinal
shootout, then shutting out the Russians for the gold medal in a 1-0
thriller, was on his game in the big international rink, stopping 18
of the Germans' 20 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably the best goalie in the world," said Germany's Marco
Sturm, who plays against Hasek in the NHL, Sturm with the San Jose
Sharks, Hasek with the Detroit Redwings. "That's why I think no
matter what team he for plays for is good."</TE>
<TE>   German goalies Christian Kunast and Marc Seliger, meanwhile, found
out what it's like to play against NHL-caliber players.</TE>
<TE>   Kunast started in goal, gave up the first four Czech goals, two of
them on power plays, then gave way to Seliger midway through the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Seliger fared no better, giving up a power-play goal three minutes
after stepping into the crease.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the efficient Czechs scored four times on the power
play, in five opportunities, getting things rolling on a goal by Jagr
only a second before the first penalty of the game was over, beating
Kunast from the right face-off circle.</TE>
<TE>   "We watched Germany the last two games, and they play very
disciplined hockey," Jagr said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important for us to get off to a good start, and we wanted
to be sure we scored the first goal, because if you don't, they can
be a very dangerous team."</TE>
<TE>   Not nearly as dangerous as a fired-up Jagr, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says, when you have your birthday, it should be your
easiest day to play," he said. "I feel pretty good today."</TE>
<TE>   The victory set the Czech Republic up for a game Sunday against
Sweden, which earlier in the day had upset favored Canada, 5-2, as
much a shock to Jagr as to everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I'm surprised," he said. "Canada, they have big names
on the team and are supposed to be one of the favorites.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's the first game and everybody has to learn to play on a
big rink, and it's a big difference [from the smaller NHL rinks].
They're going to be back. I know it, they're going to be back."</TE>
<TE>   That might not be the case for Germany, which will face Canada
next.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Jochen Hecht said, "They expect to win gold and they
lost big today, so they are going to come out flying Sunday and they
want to make a big statement."</TE>
<TE>   However bad it might be facing the Canadians, it can't be as bad
as playing the Czechs, whose rooting section, when the score became
6-1, began chanting, "Rub it in! Rub it in!"</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to offend a faithful rooting section, the Czechs
obliged.</TE>

<KH>ICE DANCING</KH>
<HD>Not Stepping on Any Toes</HD>
<DH>Dancers are unwilling to discuss pairs controversy,
preferring to focus on their own competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>If the fix is in for the Olympic ice-dancing competition, as was
rumored during one of the most contentious weeks in figure skating's
history, there was no sign of it Friday at the Salt Lake Ice Center.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, ice dancing hasn't been turned inside out in the wake
of a judging scandal in the pairs competition that Friday led to the
indefinite suspension of a French judge for not immediately reporting
attempts to influence her vote.</LD>
<LD>   The order of the top 10 ice dance couples after the first
compulsory dance, the quickstep, was the same after the second dance,
the blues. And there were the usual expressions of frustration from
competitors who find it difficult to climb in the rankings from the
middle of the pack to the top five or six.</LD>
<TE>   But there was little to raise eyebrows about in the first phase of
the competition, which counts for 20% of each couple's final score.</TE>
<TE>   Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France, the favorites,
were first, followed by Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia
and world champions Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of
Italy. Grand Prix champions Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of
Canada were fourth, just ahead of Margarita Drobiazko and Povilas
Vanagas of Lithuania.</TE>
<TE>   The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, said earlier this week
the judges had predetermined the Italians, Russians, French,
Lithuanians and Canadians would finish in that order.</TE>
<TE>   Those countries were represented in the top five Friday, but not
in the predicted order.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few ice dancers were willing to discuss the pairs
controversy and whether it would affect them.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution was a good idea," Germany's Rene Lohse said of the
International Olympic Committee's decision to elevate Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier of Canada to co-gold medalists with Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia. "But the big question is what about
the future?"</TE>
<TE>   Peizerat said he and his partner, two-time European champions and
2000 world champions, don't want to hear about the pairs fuss.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something of sport, not on ice," he said. "We are focusing
on the way we skate and our choreographies."</TE>
<TE>   Averbukh also said he's focusing on his own competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Each one has his own profession to practice," he said. "You
[reporters] write stories and publish them. We skate. We skate our
best and put out the best performance."</TE>
<TE>   Fusar-Poli had nothing to say at all, apparently disappointed by
being third.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. champions Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev are 11th. Beata
Handra and Charles Sinek, who finished fourth at last month's U.S.
championships but won an Olympic berth because the second- and
third-place duos didn't meet citizenship requirements, are 20th.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the judging in ice dancing is fair, Lang paused to think.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really have an answer for that," she said. "For us, we
just have to wait our turn. It's painful sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to wait it out. We will be there someday. It's just a
matter of time."</TE>

<LD>   DECISION</LD>
<LD>   Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze win the Olympic
gold in pairs figure skating by a 5-4 margin over Canada's Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier. The crowd jeers and commentators howl.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TUESDAY</TE>
<TE>   FUROR</TE>
<TE>   Reports speculate that French judge Marie Reine Le Gougne sided
with the Russians in exchange for a promise that judges from the
former Eastern Bloc would favor the French ice dancing team later in
the week. The International Skating Union (ISU) launches an inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WEDNESDAY</TE>
<TE>   DETAILS</TE>
<TE>   A highly placed figure skating official says Le Gougne admitted in
a judges meeting that she was under pressure from the French figure
skating federation to vote for the Russians. France's Olympic chief
confirms she may have been manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THURSDAY</TE>
<TE>   MANEUVERING</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Arbitration for Sport orders the pairs judges to stay
in Salt Lake City until Monday's ISU meeting. Le Gougne is suspended
after telling the head of the ISU that she had "submitted to a
certain pressure" from her federation to vote against the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FRIDAY</TE>
<TE>   RULING</TE>
<TE>   Citing judging misconduct, IOC President Jacques Rogge accepts the
skating union's proposal and announces that Sale and Pelletier will
receive gold medals. Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze will retain theirs.
It is the fourth time the IOC has awarded a second gold medal.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The extraordinary news conference Friday to announce that gold medals
are on the house had not ended and already Sandra Baldwin, president
of the U.S. Olympic Committee, was declaring that she will intensify
her efforts on behalf of Roy Jones Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, you might recall, beat a South Korean boxer decisively in
Seoul in 1988. But the judges, who, it since has been revealed, were
receiving payments from the host country's boxing federation, gave
the decision to the South Korean. The International Olympic Committee
has acknowledged that the circumstances were suspicious but, so far,
has rewarded Jones merely with the Olympic Order, not a gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   I applaud Baldwin's efforts on Jones' behalf.</LD>
<TE>   But why stop there?</TE>
<TE>   In 1932 in Los Angeles, Ralph Metcalfe was forced to run three or
four feet farther than his competitors in the 200 meters and finished
third. He probably would have won if everyone else hadn't had a head
start. So let's give him a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Every American gets his red, white and blue blood in a boil when
he recalls the job that was done on our basketball team in 1972. The
players are still so angry that they have never picked up their
silver medals. Now they won't have to. They can pick up their gold
medals.</TE>
<TE>   And how about the U.S. women swimmers in 1976? They were dominated
by the East Germans, who have since been confirmed as drug cheats.
Gold medals for Shirley Babashoff and the rest of the U.S. women!</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryun fell in the first round of the 1,500 meters in 1972. It
wasn't controversial. It happens in track and field. But we all know
he was the best miler in the world and would have won if not for the
unfortunate accident. He deserves a gold medal. Give him one. Same
for Mary Decker Slaney, who fell in the final of the 3,000 meters in
1984 in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Fratianne, Paul Wylie, Nancy Kerrigan. They are U.S. figure
skaters who arguably deserved the best marks from the judges in
previous Winter Olympics but went home only with silver medals. Gold
medals for them too.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the first severe test of his leadership since becoming
president of the IOC six months ago, Jacques Rogge failed miserably.</TE>
<TE>   He could have stood behind the motto of swifter, higher,
stronger--the foundation upon which Olympic athletic competition is
built. Instead, he proved himself a Belgian waffler.</TE>
<TE>   He enabled the International Skating Union, which governs figure
skating, to take the politically expedient way out of a raging
controversy in awarding a second gold medal in the pairs competition.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter that there is no evidence that the competition
was fixed for the Russians over the Canadians. The French judge at
the center of the firestorm has admitted that she was pressured to
side with the Russians, but, according to IOC Director General
Francois Carrard, the judge said in her official declaration to the
ISU that she voted her conscience. It doesn't matter that the ISU
said the investigation has not been concluded.</TE>
<TE>   All that mattered to the ISU was that NBC, much of the rest of the
North American media and figure skating fans were demanding that the
Canadians be given a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The ISU capitulated.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC approved.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what anyone might think of Juan Antonio Samaranch, and
there are plenty of reasons to believe that he idly watched while the
IOC corrupted itself in the last 10 years of his presidency, he never
would have allowed this to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch would have demanded that the ISU complete its
investigation before acting. Then, if it had found that the result
was tainted, he would have merely asked the ISU to follow its rules.</TE>
<TE>   The French judge's marks would have been eliminated and replaced
by the alternate judge's marks. In this case, the marks of the
alternate judge, who is from the Czech Republic, favored the
Canadians. (That pretty much shoots down the theory of a conspiracy
by former Soviet Bloc countries.) That would have given the
Canadians, instead of the Russians, a 5-4 edge.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians would have the gold medal alone. The Russians would
have the silver.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the IOC-ISU news conference, I went to the media
headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee for reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Hurry, come with me," said Guennadi Chvets, spokesman for the
committee. "Get your coat."</TE>
<TE>   We left the media center and piled into a crowded van waiting
outside. He told me we were going to Russia House.</TE>
<TE>   That conjured up images of a dacha from a John le Carre novel.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes later, we instead arrived at a nondescript
apartment complex in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. The Russian
team's official sponsor, apparel supplier Bosco Sport, has rented the
leasing office as a hospitality room for Russian officials, athletes
and media.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beauty of Success" signs, Bosco's motto, were on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials there didn't seem upset that their pairs team
must share a gold medal with the Canadians. But they were concerned
about the precedent it sets for the Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   "We fear this has started a snowstorm," Chvets said.</TE>
<TE>   He later interpreted the comments of Leonid Tyagachev, president
of the Russian Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't protest this decision of the IOC," Tyagachev said. "But
we don't think it is a very good decision."</TE>
<TE>   He mentioned Russian Greco-Roman wrestler Alexander Karelin. While
Americans were celebrating the incredible gold-medal match upset in
the Sydney Olympics of Rulon Gardner over Karelin, who had never been
defeated in international competition, many Russians back home were
outraged. They believed the judges had favored Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   Tyagachev said advisors approached him after the figure skating
decision was announced Friday and said he should officially protest
Karelin's loss to the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Tyagachev said. "Judging is part of sport, and we accept the
decision of the judges."</TE>
<TE>   That is noble. But I suspect the IOC would give Karelin an upgrade
if the Russians would just ask. Gold medals aren't as valuable as
they were before Friday.</TE>

<HD>Sweden Gives Canada Rude Wake-Up</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Once again, the Canadians showed why they aren't worldbeaters at the
game they consider their national property.</LD>
<LD>   Playing under international rules, with a wider rink and no red
line to cut down on long passes, the Canadian men's hockey team was
thumped by Sweden, 5-2, at the E Center on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to take this as a lesson," Canadian Coach Pat Quinn said.
"We got hammered."</LD>
<TE>   This might serve as a reminder why Sweden (1994) has won an
Olympic gold medal more recently than Canada (1952).</TE>
<TE>   The Swedes put together a textbook display of what Swedish Coach
Hardy Nilsson called "Big Ice Hockey." They got the puck to their
forwards hanging out on the blue line of their offensive zone and got
behind the Canadian defense for easy shots on Canadian goalie Curtis
Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't get so spread out," Canadian defenseman Rob Blake
said. "As a group of five, you tend to wander a little bit, and when
you do, they have guys darting through the middle to make those
plays."</TE>
<TE>   Blake scored the first goal, 2 minutes 37 seconds into the game.
But Swedish captain Mats Sundin got behind the Canadian defense three
minutes later and beat goaltender Curtis Joseph, his teammate on the
Toronto Maple Leafs. Sundin scored again in the second period, when
the Swedes fired 11 shots at Joseph and got four goals.</TE>
<TE>   When the Canadians tried to make the long pass, Sweden usually
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It really isn't our game," Canadian forward Mike Peca said.
"You've got to find a fine line between what's going to be effective
for us and how you can best use the open ice out there."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Swedish roster is loaded with NHL players as well,
they had a much easier time making the adjustment to the larger rink.</TE>
<TE>   "They grow up together, they learn together, they play on the
Olympic ice," Quinn said. "Some of the things that work tactically on
the big ice, they learn.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the Canadian kids aren't trained that way. We're trained
to shoot the puck in, knock somebody down, get the puck and put it
in."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians did create some great scoring opportunities in the
third period and ultimately outshot Sweden, 35-25, but Swedish goalie
Tommy Salo kept turning them away.</TE>
<TE>   Canada got its second goal with only 4:21 to play from Eric
Brewer, then appeared to score again on a goal by Eric Lindros 25
seconds later. But referee Dennis LaRue ruled that Peca was in the
crease when Lindros shot.</TE>
<TE>   Although it might have magnified the absence of Colorado Avalanche
goaltender Patrick Roy, who choose to stay home rather than join Team
Canada, the loss did more damage to Canadian national pride than its
medal chances. Every team in the final round advances to the
playoffs; point totals merely determine seeding. This game showed why
a team such as Sweden, with fewer NHL All-Stars than Canada, has just
as good if not a better chance of winning the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been talked about that much, but going into the
tournament we knew that about five or six teams could win it," said
Swedish defenseman Mattias Norstrom, the Kings' captain. "You saw it
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russia 6, Belarus 4--Sergei Fedorov and teenage sensation Ilya
Kovalchuk each had a goal and an assist as Russia beat Belarus in
their opening match of the final round.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of its backup goaltenders, Russia's roster is
composed entirely of NHL players. Once the dominant power of Olympic
hockey when the Soviet Union existed, Russia is many observers'
favorite to win in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Through most of their first game against the weakest team in their
group, the Russians clearly showed their superiority--but also made
enough mistakes to keep Belarus in it.</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai Khabibulin, perhaps the NHL's hottest goaltender this
season, allowed two soft goals in a shaky first Olympic appearance,
while the defenders in front of him also struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus is the only remaining team with no NHL forwards in its
lineup, but it managed 33 shots--18 in the second period as Russia
got a brief scare.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei Samsonov, skating on a potent line with Fedorov and
Kovalchuk, scored the game's first goal just 1:45 in. Russia also
used brothers Pavel and Valeri Bure together on a line with Alexei
Zhamnov, while Alexei Yashin--who scored in the second
period--centered a line with Alexei Kovalev and Andrei Nikolishin.</TE>
<TE>   Russia dominated the flow of play and took nine shots in the first
eight minutes, but Belarus evened the score when Igor Kravchuk left
the net unguarded after a faceoff, allowing Oleg Antonenko to score.</TE>
<TE>   Zhamnov put the Russians back ahead with a power-play goal late in
the period, and 18-year-old Kovalchuk got his first Olympic goal 21
seconds before intermission when his centering pass banked off a
defender and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women</TE>
<TE>   Russia 4, Kazakhstan 1--At Provo, Utah, the Russian women's hockey
team, already out of the medals round, scored its first victory of
the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians dominated their winless opponents, outshooting
Kazakhstan, 52-11. Ekaterina Pachkevitch scored first for the
Russians, now 1-2. Kazakhstan, which was also out of the medal round,
lost its third straight game.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>There are different choices here. That's the first thing you notice
when you set aside luggage that was packed in Southern California and
settle in for a long, hard Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Back home, your February hiking options are: socks or no socks.</LD>
<LD>   Here, the choices are size of trash bag. Kitchen or small
wastebasket.</LD>
<TE>   Plastic trash bags may sound a tad gauche, but they can be
lifesavers if you're planning to spend the day at Snowbasin or Utah
Olympic Park. Wrap your feet in them before you lace up your boots.
Do the same to your hands before you pull on your mittens. The bags
will keep the warmth in and the frostbite out.</TE>
<TE>   "Layering" is another phrase you hear a lot in Salt Lake, ranking
in popularity just behind, "Figure skating press conference in
Interview Room A in 15 minutes." Lots of layering before you venture
outside into snowboarding weather--in the teens. Lots of unlayering
once you step inside the arenas and the media centers, where
thermostats have been set to approximate Summer Olympic conditions.</TE>
<TE>   As Bob Condron, director of media services for the U.S. Olympic
Committee, wrote in a pre-Games memo to visiting media members,
"You've heard of layering? Well, start at zero, not at the sweater
level. Start at the naked level and go up. If zero is naked and 100
is a full-length wolverine coat with heavy wool thermals, get ready
to go to .05 at times. Be ready to peel down to a golf shirt when you
go inside.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if it's 50 below zero centigrade, you will kill
for a golf shirt if you're inside. Outside is a different deal, so
layer. But, once you get inside you'll want to start shucking."</TE>
<TE>   Outside is a very different deal. Gary Ambrose, computer system
analyst for The Times here, made the following fashion statement when
he attended the opening ceremony at Rice-Eccles Stadium:</TE>
<TE>   Two pairs of socks. Rag wool for warmth, polypropylene to "wick
the water away."</TE>
<TE>   Thermal silk underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Bluejeans.</TE>
<TE>   Gore-Tex nylon waterproof pants.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton long-sleeve shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Wool pullover sweater.</TE>
<TE>   Fleece jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Hooded parka.</TE>
<TE>   Ski cap.</TE>
<TE>   Gloves, although Ambrose says mittens are the better option: "With
all your fingers together, they generate heat."</TE>
<TE>   Burberry's cashmere scarf.</TE>
<TE>   Sorel felt-lined waterproof boots.</TE>
<TE>   And how did our man fare?</TE>
<TE>   "I was like a toaster oven," he says, except for his feet. After
three hours in the cold after sundown, the feet were starting to get
uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Should have brought the trash bags.</TE>

<LD>The International Skating Union should be ashamed of itself for
caving into the hysteria encouraged by the media.</LD>
<LD>   As those in other parts of the world tend to lump all North
Americans into the same pot, the Canadians' whining and the media's
focus on whining at the expense of authentic Olympic events just adds
one more reason to look at us in disgust. You'd think the lives of
thousands of people had been permanently scarred because a couple of
people on ice skates got a different color medal than they wanted.</LD>
<LD>   To many people outside North America we look like arrogant,
childish, morons. With good reason.</LD>

<TE>   All of a sudden, the respected voting system of the Olympic ice
skating competition turns out to be nothing more than a bunch of
corrupt judges ignoring their oath by making backroom deals to select
a winner who really did not deserve to win. This sounds like the 2000
presidential election.</TE>

<TE>   Thanks to Bill Plaschke [Feb. 14] for injecting some perspective
and common sense into the Olympic figure skating fiasco. Based on the
initial press frenzy, I thought Russia had bombed Toronto. Then I
realized it was just another incident that occurs regularly (as
Plaschke points out) in every subjectively judged sport.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, what makes anyone think that the opinion of the
audience should decide the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   If that were the case, the Oakland Raiders would never win a road
game, the New York Yankees would always lose outside the Big Apple
and Mike Tyson wouldn't win anywhere.</TE>

<TE>   Why not just shut down the Olympic figure skating competition
right now? Why allow the judges to continue the charade of rating
performances? Why broadcast at the opening ceremony the oath they
take to be impartial, fair, non-nationalistic? Let's put all of us
out of our misery.</TE>

<TE>   So Randy Harvey thinks all the furor over the pairs figure skating
judging is much ado about nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Poor NBC and its misguided announcers. The judging was just an
honest difference of opinion. I suppose Harvey also thought the O.J.
Simpson jury did a fine job.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to ask Harvey one simple, hypothetical question: If
Pelletier and Sales were Russian and the other pair was from anywhere
else, does he honestly believe that the Russian judge would have
rated them in second?</TE>
<TE>   Harvey reports that the completely unbiased, former Soviet skater
Irina Rodnina thought the Russians were better. Who is Harvey trying
to fool--himself?</TE>
<TE>   Surely, Harvey can find a more worthy group to defend than these
obviously partisan judges. What next, Randy--a piece on how all us
misinformed readers just misunderstand the Taliban?</TE>

<TE>   My gratitude to Randy Harvey for clarifying once and for all the
criteria for winning gold in Olympics pairs skating:</TE>
<TE>   1) Select music by dead European composers; 2) Wear diaphanous
costumes reminiscent of dainty French drapes that rustle in the wind;
and 3) And most important, choose a routine so complex and
challenging that all tumbles and spills are forgiven.</TE>

<TE>   I have just one question for Olympic gold medalist/skating expert
Scott Hamilton, who NBC would have us believe is also an expert on
judging: Why was it a "major error" when Russian pairs skater Anton
Sikharulidze stepped out of one double axel, but it was only "a few
minor errors" when American men's skater Michael Weiss stepped out of
several triple jumps? Just curious.</TE>

<TE>   Every time a sporting event involving judging (ice skating,
gymnastics, diving, etc.) comes along, I swear I won't watch it
because I expect something like this to happen ... and it usually
does.</TE>

<TE>   As usual, Mr. Plaschke wrote a fine column when he described our
nation's disappointment in the men's downhill results in general and
Daron Rahlves' results in particular [Feb. 11]. But I was sorely
disappointed when he conferred the name "Jean-Claude Silly" on Daron.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, Mr. Plaschke was on-point when he compared
downhillers to NASCAR drivers, linebackers and the like. That makes
it all the more peculiar that he was so flippant about the run that
Daron made. He seemed to already know that a split-second error can
not only remove a brave competitor from the podium, but indeed can
cost him his life.</TE>
<TE>   While Daron was flying dangerously (was this the "silly" part?)
through the air at a speed most of us can only imagine, I marveled at
the skill he displayed to save his life.</TE>
<TE>   Keep up the good work, Bill. But please don't disparage these
brave, gifted athletes--even when they falter.</TE>
<TE>   If you really need some perspective on this, go to the top of
Mammoth Mountain's cornice, point your skis straight downhill, and
midway down consider anew your coy description. (Psst: Olympic
downhillers are going twice as fast.)</TE>

<TE>   1. Americans adapt the ultimate slacker sport for snow.</TE>
<TE>   2. Americans bribe/bully the Olympic committee to make it a winter

<TE>   3. Americans dominate the sport only they and their slacker kids
are interested in.</TE>

<TE>   I find it irritating that snowboarding has become an Olympic event
before skateboarding. How can the powers that be justify this obvious
oversight? All of the tricks done on snowboards were invented by
skateboarders who worked for decades to develop them.</TE>
<TE>   Skateboarding is a more difficult, more physically punishing sport
than snowboarding. When will the powers that be give skateboarding
the respect and place it deserves in Olympic competition? For God's
sake, we've got people shooting rifles, curling and lifting weights
for gold medals. Surely we can make room for a sport that requires
more athleticism than any of those three combined.</TE>

<TE>   So the IOC and international sports community have a problem with
too much American patriotism. Well, I've watched the Games, and here
is what I have seen: Russian figure skaters who live and train in
Pennsylvania, Illinois and California; one Russian figure skater who
says he is going to apply for U.S. citizenship after he is through
competing for Russia in these Games; bobsledders living in California
but competing for Armenia; and, of course, countless hockey players
representing their respective countries for two weeks, but earning a
living playing in the NHL and living in North America.</TE>
<TE>   So you know what I say to the protesters of patriotism? Keep your
athletes home and let them train in the facilities you have. If you
don't like what we have done, we can always pull our money and
athletes out of the games and NBC sure wouldn't bother paying to
broadcast them. Just imagine what a glorious event all of you
wouldn't be having then.</TE>

<TE>   I just read the article about the reforms from the George
Steinbrenner report. Let's see, we're paying some athletes more than
$100,000 to train. Isn't that what we used to get mad at the Soviets
and East Germans for doing?</TE>
<TE>   I guess since we're the good guys, it's all right.</TE>

<TE>   The duration of this bloated affair should be cut in half via
these recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Opening and closing ceremonies: Eliminate them.</TE>
<TE>   Skiing: Keep the downhill, eliminate the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Skating: Keep one sprint and one distance race, eliminate the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Bobsled, luge and skeleton: Combine into one event. Call it
"sledding."</TE>

it.</TE>

<TE>   Because tape-delayed coverage of the Olympics is inevitable, I
have a suggestion for NBC--never show only one non-American longshot.
Always throw in coverage of a few also-rans as decoys. When you show
only one, it's pretty obvious they're gonna win. Why else would you
be showing them?</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lugers Make a New Double Play</HD>

<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Four years ago, the U.S. Olympic doubles luge teams provided history.
Friday, they provided an encore.</LD>
<LD>   In the long run, the latter is more important for an American luge
program that until the 1998 Games at Nagano had never produced an
Olympic medal. Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer won a silver medal there,
and Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin added bronze. On Friday at Utah
Olympic Park, Grimmette, Martin and Thorpe helped prove U.S. luge
prosperity might be here to stay, sliding to medals for the second
time.</LD>
<LD>   This time Grimmette and Martin won the silver medal, and this time
Thorpe rode with Clay Ives, a two-time Canadian Olympian who became a
dual citizen after the Nagano Games, for the bronze medal.</LD>
<TE>   In another echo from Nagano, Friday's American lugers watched a
German sled finish ahead of them. In '98, the winners were Stefan
Krausse and Jan Behrendt, who retired. On Friday Patric-Fritz Leitner
and Alexander Resch won the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Leitner and Resch broke their own track record with a time of
42.953 seconds on their first run, despite having the field's
fifth-best starting time and brushing the wall coming off the final
curve. In their second run, they had just the 13th-best start but
drove the course deftly and finished with a total time of 1:26.082,
.134 seconds ahead of Grimmette and Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe and Ives broke their own track start record with a
3.045-second effort on their first run to lead Grimmette and Martin
by .098 in the race for the silver medal. But Thorpe drove "a little
too tight" on his second run, and he and Ives finished in 1:26.220,
just .004 of a second--or literally inches--behind their teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Only weeks ago, it seemed doubtful either duo would stand on the
medal podium, as both teams struggled through the early stages of the
World Cup season. Through the first six of the circuit's seven races,
the best Grimmette and Martin could manage was two third-place
finishes, and the best Thorpe and Ives could do was a seventh. In the
World Cup finale late last month, Thorpe and Ives catapulted to
second place, but Grimmette and Martin slid to 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Thorpe and Ives, who joined forces after Sheer retired in 2000 and
Ives left the Canadian luge program for lack of financial support,
were still adjusting to each other. Grimmette and Martin were
struggling to find the right sled setup.</TE>
<TE>   Friday it all came together, even though Thorpe, who's retiring,
said he was "never that nervous in my life," more nervous than he
expects to be next month when his wife, Kriste, gives birth to their
first child. Ives tried to calm his partner.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Kriste is going to have a baby in a couple weeks,'"
Ives said. "'If she can do that, we can do this. Let's put down a
good one.'"</TE>
<TE>   Seasoned by competition and travel, Ives enjoys public speaking,
especially in front of student groups. He thought about those talks
Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "We always say competing and being a competitor is what's
important and winning isn't everything," said Ives, 29, whose best
previous Olympic finish was an eighth in 1994. "But when I rolled out
of bed this morning, I thought, 'It is everything.' I didn't work 15
years to say competing is everything and winning isn't important."</TE>
<TE>   Grimmette and Thorpe, both 31, grew up in Michigan. Martin, 28,
from Palo Alto, got his luge start in 1988 at a wheel clinic by U.S.
slider Bonny Warner in a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like a fun thing to do for an afternoon," said Martin.
"Fourteen years later I'm sitting here, and I'm proud of every minute
of it."</TE>

<KH>FROM SILVER TO GOLD</KH>
<HD>A New Golden Rule</HD>
<DH>After Canadians are awarded a second pair of gold medals,
USOC president says she wants one for Roy Jones.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY and DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after Olympic officials changed the results in the pairs figure
skating competition Friday, awarding a second set of gold medals, a
U.S. official said she will seek to reopen the case of an American
boxer who lost a controversial decision at the 1988 Seoul Games.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade has passed since Roy Jones Jr. appeared to
dominate his gold-medal bout against South Korea's Park Si Hun,
landing more than twice as many punches by one estimate. The 3-2
decision in Park's favor has been the subject of lingering debate.</LD>
<LD>   So when the International Olympic Committee gave duplicate gold
medals to the Canadian skating pair of Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier, who also finished second after a widely questioned
decision, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee announced she
is ready for one more try on Jones' behalf.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to do it here," Sandra Baldwin, who is also a
recently appointed IOC member, told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to take away from the athletes here. But I do want
to have a dialogue about Roy Jones one more time."</TE>
<TE>   IOC President Jacques Rogge was asked about the case during a news
conference Friday. He was noncommittal but did not appear to rule out
the idea of an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, meanwhile, applauded the IOC's actions in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the right thing to do and sends a clear message that bias
and corruption in judging Olympic events should not be tolerated,"
said Jones, later adding that the decision also "gives my situation
life. There's a possibility there still will be a gold-medal reward
for me. It should have been awarded a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   According to a company charting the bout for NBC, Jones landed 86
punches to Park's 32. After the decision was announced, the South
Korean boxer reportedly apologized to his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   There were allegations of bribes and of paybacks for supposed
pro-U.S. decisions during the 1984 Los Angeles Games. The issue
resurfaced in 1996 with the discovery of files from the Stasi, the
former East German secret police, suggesting that payments of unknown
origin had been made to boxing officials at the Seoul Games. Anita
DeFrantz, the senior American IOC member, called for an investigation
and the USOC asked that Jones--who has since forged a successful
professional career--be allowed to share the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   An IOC task force found that judges had received money from their
Korean hosts but the investigation stalled thereafter. As a
compromise, the IOC awarded Jones its highest honor, the Olympic
Order, in 1997. The boxer was appreciative but said that he would
"die with a little hope in me" that the gold medal might someday be
his.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said that Friday's developments might have revived that
hope: "We now have a precedent that we didn't have before."</TE>
<TE>   It would not be unprecedented for the IOC to go back and award a
gold medal, even so many years later:</TE>
<TE>   * Jim Thorpe won the decathlon and pentathlon at the 1912 Games
but was struck from the rolls of Olympic champions after it was
discovered he had previously played semipro baseball for $2 a game.
His medals went to the second-place finishers, Hugo Wieslander of
Sweden and Ferdinand Bie of Norway, respectively, who reluctantly
accepted them. The IOC reversed its decision 70 years later,
returning the medals posthumously.</TE>
<TE>   * Fifty years after the 1924 Games in Chamonix, France, a
Norwegian historian studied old records and found a scoring error in
the ski jumping results. Thorleif Haug of Norway--an Olympic legend
dead for 40 years--was demoted to fourth place. Eighty-three-year-old
Anders Haugen of the United States received the bronze medal in a
special ceremony in Oslo.</TE>
<TE>   * At the 1984 Los Angeles Games, American Kim Turner and France's
Michele Chardonnet finished in a dead heat for third place in the
women's 100-meter hurdles. The bronze was awarded to Turner but
several months later, after studying photographs of the race, the IOC
gave an additional medal to Chardonnet.</TE>
<TE>   * The Canadians were the focal point of another controversy during
the synchronized swimming competition at the 1992 Barcelona Games. A
Brazilian judge typed the wrong score into her computer and was not
allowed to make a correction. The typo dropped Canada's Sylvie
Frechette out of first place, but the IOC's executive board
subsequently ruled that she should share the gold with America's
Kristen Babb-Sprague.</TE>
<TE>   Though much public attention is focused on such incidents, they
are relatively rare when compared to the thousands of competitions
held at scores of Winter and Summer games since 1896, said John
Lucas, a professor emeritus at Penn State whose books on the subject
include "Future of the Olympic Games."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's decision and the ongoing investigation could lead to
improvements in the way figure skating is judged, but Lucas sees no
such benefits to reopening older cases. He wonders where the line
would be drawn.</TE>
<TE>   The same question occurred to Ed Ratleff, a member of the U.S.
Olympic basketball team that lost a controversial gold-medal game to
the Soviet Union at the 1972 Munich Games.</TE>
<TE>   "People who know basketball and watched at the time, they know we
should have won," Ratleff said. "The thing is, [the skating decision]
is happening right now. Our game was 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   For that reason alone, Lucas doubts that Baldwin will get very far
with the Jones case.</TE>
<TE>   "The Greeks in antiquity had a mythological story about opening
Pandora's box," the historian said. "In every single case, dread and
horror occurred when you opened that box. That's why I think no good
can come of it."</TE>

<LD>Frank Carroll, who coached Timothy Goebel to a figure skating bronze

acknowledged he will probably watch her skate on TV "in my own little
cocoon, my own little atmosphere."</LD>
<LD>   Carroll coached Kwan for nearly a decade, guiding her to five U.S.
titles and four world championships. She ended their association last
October, saying she needed to control her skating and her life.</LD>
<TE>   "I just didn't want to be around," Carroll said. "I felt Michelle,
once she competes, did not need me to be around and potentially cause
a distraction and have people come up to me asking questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I left Tim there to have a great time with the speedskaters he's
made friends with and to enjoy the rest of the Games."</TE>
<TE>   The women's competition will take place Tuesday, with the short
program, and Thursday, with the long program. Kwan has been
practicing in Salt Lake City all week, generally having the ice to
herself. However, Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who returned home to
train in familiar surroundings at Aliso Viejo and Lake Arrowhead, was
scheduled to return to Salt Lake City late Friday and practice today
at the Steiner Ice Arena, the official practice rink.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Min Ryoung, the South Korean short-track speedskater who was
injured Wednesday night when he slid hard into the boards after
colliding with American Rusty Smith during a race, will miss the rest
of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Min, 19, was not seriously hurt but bruised and battered enough
that the Korean delegation withdrew him from competition.</TE>
<TE>   Taken from the ice on a stretcher, his head in a stabilizing
brace, Min was treated at LSD Hospital in Salt Lake City, then
released.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Per Elofsson, still looking for his first medal of the
Winter Games, withdrew from Sunday's 4x10-kilometer men's
cross-country relay because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   Swedish team officials said Elofsson has a cold but hopes to be
ready for the 50K classic-style event next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russian goalie Nikolai Khabibulin got the first hockey gold medal
at the Salt Lake City Olympics before he even played a game.</TE>
<TE>   In what his fellow players described as an emotional locker room
ceremony, Khabibulin was presented with the gold medal he earned as a
backup goalie in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin didn't get his medal then because Coach Viktor Tikhonov
took it and kept it for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Khabibulin did not play in any games at Albertville for the
Unified Team, but he was on the roster and entitled to a gold medal.
As the team assembled to receive medals, Khabibulin was not summoned
to the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Tikhonov was photographed wearing a medal--even though only
players, not coaches, were entitled to medals.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Eighteen years after his appearance at the 1984 Winter Olympics in
Sarajevo, Scott Hamilton won his second gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   He won it for Canada, teaming with Sandra Bezic in pairs freestyle
media ring-leading, even though he was born and lives in the United
States. But, then, borders and affiliations have become so blurred at
these Games.</LD>
<LD>   Without Hamilton, who declared the losers winners on NBC, and
without Bezic, who said her heart broke when the scores were posted,
Jamie Sale and David Pelletier very likely would be Olympic silver
medalists today.</LD>
<TE>   Without Hamilton and Bezic ratcheting up the outrage, without NBC
getting the Canada-got-hosed snowball rolling, the Russian figure
skating duo of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze would already
be in the record book as the one and only pairs champions of the 2002
Winter Olympics, having won a close competition in Salt Lake, and
that would be it.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton and Bezic set the tone, set the stage, and from there,
Media Team North America drove it home.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, you might have missed it, but the United States and Canada
now play under the same flag. There was no formal announcement; we
just adopted them this week when it became obvious:</TE>
<TE>   The United States didn't have a chance to win the pairs figure
skating medal.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, our unassuming, under-protected neighbor to the north,
did.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, our Cold War adversary from decades past, bullied its way
into the scene, maybe or maybe not cutting a favor-swapping deal with
another big league player we do not completely trust, the arrogant
French.</TE>
<TE>   We couldn't just sit there and watch quietly while our little
Canadian cousins got trampled underfoot. That isn't the American way.
Canada clearly needed help. And Canada clearly wasn't China or
Germany or Russia--countries that come up lacking when it comes to
the all-important Middle America cuddliness factor.</TE>
<TE>   (Say the Russians and Canadians had switched roles. Say the
Canadians had edged the Russians with the aid of a possibly tainted
judge's vote. Would the public response have mustered even half the
decibel level? Russians love their figure skaters too, but this is
Salt Lake City. Most likely, there would have been a few "Tough break
theres" and we all quickly would have moved on to short-track
speedskating.)</TE>
<TE>   Canada alone didn't have the juice to take on the International
Skating Union and the International Olympic Committee, which normally
responds to scandalous allegations by commissioning a study on the
hope it will take years and years before, eventually, everyone
forgets about it.</TE>
<TE>   And NBC (stands for North American Broadcasting Co.) clearly
needed the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   So we co-opted Canada. Maybe we felt a little red-faced about
South Park and "Blame Canada." Maybe we felt a little guilty about
what's happening to the Expos. Most likely, we saw a story with all
the required crowd-pleasing elements--innocent victims, dark rumors
of conspiracy, righteous indignation and a big, bad bureaucracy
yawning in the other corner--and, unable to help ourselves,
finger-snap, we released the media hounds.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-mph winds that wiped out the first day of Nordic combined
here were nothing compared to the gale force of the North American
newspapers and TV networks this week. ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta
looked like a man caught in a hurricane during a Tuesday press
briefing that quickly morphed into a police interrogation. "Canadians
jobbed" became the mantra of the day, every day, despite the muffled
claims of some impartial observers that maybe the Russians had skated
a more intricate, more sophisticated and, well, a better long
program.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's news conference announcing the awarding of a second
set of gold medals to Sale and Pelletier, Hamilton and Bezic could be
seen on television screens throughout the Main Press Center,
discussing the development with NBC's Jim Lampley.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, Scott," one U.S. writer muttered sarcastically as he walked
by one of the monitors, "you're happy now."</TE>
<TE>   He certainly was.</TE>
<TE>   "I am just happy that the IOC forced the issue and made sure this
happened now because it was overtaking everything," Hamilton said.
"Nobody could focus on any other events."</TE>
<TE>   And NBC has lots of other events to televise.</TE>
<TE>   "These athletes deserve their time to shine," Hamilton continued.
"I think the IOC, by forcing the ISU to come to some sort of
resolution immediately, now we can get back to the Games and everyone
here can really get back to celebrating the Olympics and what it's
all about."</TE>
<TE>   And NBC can get monster ratings when the IOC holds a second pairs
medals ceremony to hand Sale and Pelletier a second pair of pairs
gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said he felt badly because when he tried to talk to
Sikharulidze earlier in the week, the Russian skater "wanted to avoid
eye contact, like he didn't want to acknowledge me because as much as
I'm not responsible, I am connected to it.</TE>
<TE>   "And I don't feel responsible. We called the event as we saw it.
And fortunately, a lot of other people saw it the way we did too."</TE>
<TE>   The power of the press, coupled with the dire desire of two
embattled international sports organizations to sweep all this
negative publicity quickly out of play, was truly awesome to behold.
Media Team North America rules.</TE>
<TE>   Which raises a question: If and when Canada and the United States
meet in the hockey tournament, whom are we supposed to root for? Now
that we're playing for the same team.</TE>

<HD>A New Golden Rule</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>In a transaction completed on a warped and rickety pulpit Friday, the
Olympic ideal was formally sold.</LD>
<LD>   The buyers were public opinion, network television and jingoism.</LD>
<LD>   The price was justice.</LD>
<TE>   The cost was integrity.</TE>
<TE>   The new owners will move in as soon as they can evict those awful
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Two gold medals, for an event that had earlier possessed a defined
winner and runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   Two more gold medals than pieces of clear evidence to support
them.</TE>
<TE>   Two more gold medals than stomach muscles in the people who made
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one reason the Olympic arm pulled Canadian pairs
skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier up to the top step of the
podium Friday with Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were tired of that arm being twisted.</TE>
<TE>   They were weary of newspaper criticism in the United States and
Canada, worn out from the screeching on NBC, worried that their Games
were being obscured by a fur-lined, bespectacled vision named Marie
Reine Le Gougne.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't a cry for justice.</TE>
<TE>   It was a cry of uncle.</TE>
<TE>   By changing medal colors because of judging misconduct for the
first time in 106 years of Olympic history, the Olympic bosses
betrayed their own motto.</TE>
<TE>   Faster, Higher, Stronger?</TE>
<TE>   Weaker, Weaker, Weaker.</TE>
<TE>   They changed a medal despite no proof it was awarded unfairly.</TE>
<TE>   They changed a medal despite no exhaustive search for that proof.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of carefully awarding the medal, they tossed it over their
shoulders while on a dead run from an angry mob.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ottavio Cinquanta, skating's international boss: "We have
set, I will say as a former speedskater, a world record."</TE>
<TE>   And he's proud of this?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Le Gougne did indeed vote for the Russians because of
outside pressure, giving them the 5-4 victory. Maybe the event was
indeed rigged.</TE>
<TE>   But she never admitted that, and officials have no firm evidence.</TE>
<TE>   She copped only to the existence of pressure, while signing a
declaration that she nonetheless voted her conscience.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a big difference," said Francois Carrard, director
general of the International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to feel pressure to vote for someone. But it is an
entirely different thing if you vote for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt the pressure, but it did not change her vote."</TE>
<TE>   Then why did it ultimately change the result?</TE>
<TE>   See if you can't follow this triple-toe loophole:</TE>
<TE>   Under International Skating Union rules, judges must report all
outside pressure before the competition. Using that rule, the ISU
suspended Le Gougne for misconduct, at which point it handed the
flaming mess to the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC could have simply requested an investigation and kept the
medals intact, a long but fair process that could have contributed to
the reformation of a troubled sport.</TE>
<TE>   But instead, after the Canadians applied a final push with a
flimsy appeal to an independent arbitration panel, the IOC took the
easy way out and just smelted another piece of gold.</TE>
<TE>   Said IOC President Jacques Rogge: "I don't think this has created
damage to the Olympic movement because it was resolved fast...."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, he's right. It worked. The mob relented. Smiles all around.
The Olympics have been saved!</TE>
<TE>   You'll be hearing that in many places today. Certainly, there is
no defense for the sort of vote-rigging for which Le Gougne has been
accused. Based on past figure skating problems, who could discount
anything?</TE>
<TE>   But it's still only an accusation. And even in this nutty
environment, there still exists the concept of a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as pretty or charming, but isn't due process still more
important than Jamie Sale or David Pelletier? And is it really fair
to ignore the Russians, in the wrong place at the wrong time?</TE>
<TE>   When asked to guess his country's feelings about sharing that
medal, a Russian journalist shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you share a wife?" asked Nikolai Dolgopolov, executive editor
of Trud, one of the largest Russian newspapers. "I know I can't."</TE>
<TE>   While only two Russians asked questions during the hourlong medals
news conference--they may have been the only two Russian reporters in
the room--other officials were contacted later.</TE>
<TE>   As stunning as it might sound to those who have increasingly
regarded them as invisible, they are alive and hurting.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unprecedented decision that turned out to be a result
of pressure by the North American press, and turned out in favor of
the fanatically loyal [North American] fans," Valentin Piseyev,
Russia's skating boss, told Russia's NTV television by telephones
from Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was this from Deputy Prime Minister Valentina
Matviyenko: "It's a disgraceful fuss. The International Olympic
Committee should get to the root of it and not allow American mass
media and amateurs give marks to our skaters."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but we can counter that quote with a bigger hammer.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think it's the right thing to award two gold medals for the
skaters," said President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   That should make you glad that he's the chief executive and not
the county judge.</TE>
<TE>   The question was asked Friday: What happens to the Canadian pair's
silver medal?</TE>
<TE>   It should go to Scott Hamilton, the NBC commentator who led the
charge to have it changed. Walking to the news conference Friday, he
was openly congratulated by workers.</TE>
<TE>   A special commendation goes to the media, whose undying support of
this issue--hey, it's an easy column--was recognized in the opening
remarks by Canada's delegation chief Sally Rehorick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful, the support you've given us throughout the week,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Olympic officials who made this decision, they have
earned more than a one-time award or medal.</TE>
<TE>   By popping open a bottle of whines that will forever affect every
event that uses subjective judging--from Roy Jones Jr. until
forever--they have earned a lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   As I was finishing this column, Sweden was in the processing of
upsetting Canada, 5-2, in hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Upon which a colleague shouted, "Don't worry, the Canadians are
going to appeal it."</TE>
<TE>   You think that's funny? I don't.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Questions and answers from Friday's gold-medal skating decision:</LD>
<LD>   Question: Have Olympic medals ever been rewarded after competition
ended?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Seven times previously, a medal has been awarded to an
Olympic athlete later. But this is the first for alleged judging
impropriety.</LD>
<TE>   Q: What kinds of things brought other reversals?</TE>
<TE>   A: Discovery of pro careers in the days when the Olympics were
allegedly amateur; statistical scoring errors, etc. The most recent
reversal occurred when a judge in synchronized swimming at the '92
Summer Games hit the wrong key on her scoring keyboard and said so
immediately. A year later, the rightful winner received her medal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When will the Canadian pairs team be awarded their gold medals?</TE>
<TE>   A: The decision is pending, but the International Olympic
Committee is leaning toward handing them out at the medal ceremony in
the Medal Plaza tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Will the Russians, the original gold-medal-winning team, and
the Chinese bronze-medal team, be there, standing on the podium with
the Canadians?</TE>
<TE>   A: That, too, will be decided today. If you are inclined to bet,
bet no.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are there a bunch of spare gold medals lying around for cases
just like this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Absolutely not. Olympic officials had one on hand, at the firm
in Salt Lake that designed and manufactured the medals, O.C. Tanner.
But that one was supposed to be for the archives. O.C. Tanner had to
work fast. It had produced 862 medals for Salt Lake, now it was going
to up that total to 863. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee called
immediately after the announcement Friday morning. The company had a
blank, but much hand-work needed to be done. Each medal is made of
sterling silver and six grams of gold plating on top.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, is the medal ready?</TE>
<TE>   A: The medal, plus the spare, were picked up shortly after 6:30
p.m. Friday, by none other than SLOC President Mitt Romney, in an
armored car.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is this decision the end of the controversy?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's not even the end of the investigation. According to
Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy, president of the International Skating
Union, his group had enough evidence to award the additional gold
medals, but is still pursuing details.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was the specific action taken against the French judge in
question?</TE>
<TE>   A: She was suspended indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What does that mean?</TE>
<TE>   A: Traditionally, in international sports, these suspensions last
about as long as the media stay interested. Once the media stop
caring, stop writing and broadcasting about it, she comes off
suspension. Look for Marie Riene Le Gougne in a judging box near you
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Isn't this too complicated a case to resolve so quickly?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did they do it this way?</TE>
<TE>   A: Because they sincerely felt that this story was taking over the
Games, detracting from the performance of other athletes. They also
got beat down by the daily crush of media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But didn't they say that the pressure from the media didn't
influence their decision?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, they said that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are they not telling the entire truth?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is a term for this. It is also used in political
reporting a lot. It is called "spin."</TE>
<TE>   Q: In retrospect, was this really that big a deal?</TE>
<TE>   A: A huge deal. The Olympic movement mouths honesty and integrity
and character building and fair play every time it parts its lips. So
to have some evidence of a tainted judging decision, or at least a
tainted state of mind affecting a judging decision, is significant.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So, in the long term, will there be reforms, fixes? Or will we
go through this again?</TE>
<TE>   A: Probably. The Olympics are run by thousands of people in
hundreds of organizations, most of them very well-meaning but a few
with agendas that are not in line with the Olympic ordeal. Expect to
get your double lutzes in an uproar again in a few years.</TE>

<HD>Gardner Is Hospitalized</HD>
<DH>Wrestling: 2000 star has hypothermia and possibly
frostbite.</DH>

<LD>Rulon Gardner, whose "Miracle on the Mat" victory in Greco-Roman
wrestling made him the American darling of the 2000 Summer Olympics,
was hospitalized early Friday morning for hypothermia and possible
frostbite after spending the night outside when he became stranded
while snowmobiling near his hometown of Afton, Wyo.</LD>
<LD>   Gardner spent the night in temperatures near 20 degrees below zero
after getting stuck in deep snow in the Bridger-Teton National
Forest, Lt. Tim Malik of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Dept. said.</LD>
<LD>   Three friends who had been out with Gardner reported him missing
at 7:40 p.m. Thursday, but rescuers on snowmobiles and snowshoes
could not find him.</LD>
<TE>   Gardner, wearing several layers of clothing but still an
inadequate amount for a night spent outdoors, was spotted by a search
plane Friday at about 8 a.m., Malik said. Authorities were concerned
when Gardner could not get up to gather extra clothing dropped to him
by a helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   "He had so much ice on his feet, I don't think he was able to
walk," said Lincoln County Sheriff Lee Gardner, a distant cousin of
the Greco-Roman gold medalist.</TE>
<TE>   "In that kind of weather, it's unusual for someone to stay out all
night like that and survive without any kind of shelter," he said.
"But he's a strong man, and he made it."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner was flown by helicopter to Star Valley Medical Center in
Afton and later transported to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center
in Idaho Falls, where hospital officials, acting on the family's
request, would not comment on the wrestler's health.</TE>
<TE>   Reading from a statement, Gardner's brother, Russell, said: "I've
just come from seeing Rulon and we are very optimistic about his
condition and recovery." A news conference to update Gardner's
condition is scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner's friends left the forest because they were running out of
gas for their snowmobiles, Malik said.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to free his snowmobile from the steep terrain, Gardner
moved out on foot and was found the next morning in the Salt River
drainage, about five miles southeast of the town of Smoot.</TE>
<TE>   "He had moved down that drainage several miles in the night," said
Benton Smith, a spokesman for the Bridger-Teton National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sydney Olympics, Gardner stunned three-time gold medalist
Alexander Karelin of Russia to pull off one of the greatest upsets in
U.S. Olympic history. Karelin had not lost an international match
since 1987.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Myles Brundidge made a strategic shot to help the U.S. men's curling
team beat winless France, 8-3, on Friday, keeping the Americans in
contention in the Olympic tournament at Ogden, Utah.</LD>
<LD>   The French tried to set up a steal on an early shot in the sixth
end, with the scored tied, 2-2. Brundidge made a difficult takeout,
shifting the momentum and helping the United States (3-3) win two
points.</LD>
<LD>   "Our destiny is in our hands," Brundidge said. "I think all along
we knew that three losses would get us into the semifinals. We didn't
want to have them this early, but now we control our own destiny."</LD>
<TE>   France (0-6) scored in the eighth, but the U.S. scored three
points in the ninth and forced the French to concede.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing less aggressively," said U.S. skip Tim
Somerville. "Before, there were too many rocks in play, and we
weren't doing well."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays again today against Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   In other early games, Finland beat Britain, 6-4; Canada beat
Germany, 9-7; and Norway beat Denmark, 9-4.</TE>
<TE>   In late session games, Canada beat Switzerland, 7-2; Sweden beat
France, 9-6; Denmark beat Britain, 6-5; and Norway beat Finland, 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   Canada leads the men's tournament with a 6-1 record. Norway is
5-1.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's tournament, Norway beat Russia, 5-4; Canada beat
Germany, 8-4; Britain beat Switzerland, 7-4; and Sweden beat Japan,
8-7. Canada leads the women's standings at 6-0, and Switzerland is
5-1. The U.S., which didn't play Friday, is 2-3.</TE>

<TE>   Nordic Combined</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Nordic combined team might have welcomed a weather delay
at previous Olympics. After all, it would have amounted to a reprieve
from another bleak performance.</TE>
<TE>   Not in Salt Lake City. The Americans are eager for the wind to
stop so they can put on a show.</TE>
<TE>   The jumping half of the team event was postponed Thursday because
of swirling winds on the small hill at Olympic Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we're all let down," U.S. team member Bill Demong
said. "We wanted to jump today. We've been looking forward to this
competition all season, and we feel like we have something to prove.
When the weather is ready, we'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   The jumping was rescheduled for today, with the second half of the
event--the 40-kilometer cross-country relay race on the Soldier
Hollow course--set for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Nordic combined and biathlon are the only sports in Winter
Olympics history in which no one from the U.S. has won a medal.</TE>

<KH>FROM SILVER TO GOLD</KH>
<HD>It's an Outrage to Russians</HD>
<DH>They charge that IOC decision to give the Canadians a
second pair of golds is a result of media pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian Olympic skating gold medalist Anton Sikharulidze, distressed
and indignant at Friday's decision to award a second gold to the
rival Canadian skating pair, said there had been competitions in
which he and partner Elena Berezhnaya had skated as well as their
Canadian rivals but had to accept silver medals. But he said they
never complained.</LD>
<LD>   He said the decision to award a second gold was "totally wrong"
and "not done."</LD>
<LD>   There was a chorus of outrage in Russia over the decision, with
accusations that the Canadians were unsporting for refusing to accept
the judges' decision.</LD>
<TE>   "If someone insists that our skating is equal and that it is
impossible to determine who is the best--Russia or Canada--then let's
remember the past and think about all the championships and
tournaments when both pairs were also said to be equal, but the
Canadians would get the gold, while we would have to be content with
silver.</TE>
<TE>   "We would just comply with the decision of referees, take our
silver and we never complained. If we are so equal, let us take the
gold medals for all those cases too," Sikharulidze said in a
telephone interview from Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   After Canadian skaters, Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, were
narrowly defeated by the Russian pair in the ice-dancing competition,
an outrage erupted over the decision.</TE>
<TE>   A French judge Marie Reine Le Gougne, said she had been pressured
over the judging, but French Olympics officials reported that she
nonetheless voted honestly.</TE>
<TE>   Sikharulidze said the controversy over the decision was based on
the perceptions of laypeople, not experts.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact the opinion of laymen, the opinion of the crowd and not
professionals, determined the fate of the golden medals," he
complained. "I personally have not seen any true experts in figure
skating against the original decision of the panel of referees."</TE>
<TE>   Sikharulidze said the controversy had been enormously stressful as
he and Berezhnaya faced hostile media that seemed to support the
Canadian cause.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to fight their television and crowds of
aggressive, unfriendly reporters. We do not have anyone backing us
up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was sure that he and Berezhnaya had won the medal fairly, but
in future they would be even more motivated in competition against
the Canadian pair.</TE>
<TE>   "The unscrupulousness is the saddest thing--they are ready to
wangle these medals by hook or by crook. To them, it does not matter
how they get the medals, it only matters that they do get them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian skater Pelletier was so outraged over the original
judging, which gave the Russian pair gold despite flaws in their
skating, that he announced he was thinking of quitting over it.
However Sikharulidze said he would never dream of quitting over a
judging controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is unhappy about something in figure skating, if
someone thinks about quitting--let him quit. It means that a person
is not confident enough, that he is not strong and that he does not
trust himself. We are prepared to carry on and win more medals," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tariel G. Sikharulidze, Anton Sikharulidze's father, speaking by
telephone from St. Petersburg, Russia, said the idea of two gold
medals was "ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened here leaves a huge stain on the reputation of
the Games. It is a disgusting story, and I feel that I have been spat
in the face.</TE>
<TE>   "In sports it is he who does better than everyone else who gets
the prize, not the one with the biggest mouth."</TE>
<TE>   He said if it had been the Russians who had missed out on gold in
similar circumstances, no one would have dreamed of awarding a gold
medal to the Russian team.</TE>
<TE>   "That the Canadians have finally wrung the gold medals for
themselves can only be explained by the unprecedented campaign in the
mass media which presented the situation as if the Russian couple had
robbed the Canadians," he complained.</TE>
<TE>   He said the controversy and resulting decision to award a gold
medal to the Canadians created a bad precedent that opened the way
for endless debates among athletes and teams.</TE>
<TE>   Tatyana Berezhnaya, 49, Elena Berezhnaya's mother from
Nevinnomyssk, in southern Russia, was shocked.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened is totally unfair and wrong," she said in a
telephone interview. "I think that the way our figure skaters were
treated is sheer discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have seen in Salt Lake City is a dirty gamble, not figure
skating. It is very unsporting. As a mother of an Olympic champion, I
feel so deeply offended I am ready to cry.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter and her partner do not deserve to share the first
place with anyone else. They were the best."</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's decision awarding the gold to the Canadians,
Russian Figure Skating Federation chief Valentin Piseyev, denied any
impropriety relating to judges, dismissing the allegations as
nonsense. He complained that a massive attack had been launched on
the Russian skating pair.</TE>
<TE>   "All the ill-wishers simply cannot live with the fact that Russian
skating pairs have remained unbeaten for the past 38 years running.</TE>
<TE>   "As to the intrigues around the [Russian skaters], I can only say,
one must accept defeat honorably," he said.</TE>

<HD>Klug Completes Miracle on Snow</HD>
<DH>Eighteen months after a liver transplant, he wins giant
slalom bronze and helps U.S. set record for Winter Games medals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>In what has to rank as one of the greatest accomplishments in medical
and sporting history, 29-year-old Chris Klug of Aspen, Colo., who 18
months ago underwent a liver transplant, on Friday won an Olympic
medal in snowboard parallel giant slalom.</LD>
<LD>   It was bronze, not gold. But no matter.</LD>
<LD>   "Medically speaking," Martin S. Levine, a New Jersey physician and
U.S. Olympic team doctor, said moments after Klug had flashed to
bronze, "this is impossible."</LD>
<TE>   Said Klug's father, Warren: "We are the proudest family in the
Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Klug said, "It's awesome. That's the most fun day of my life,
probably."</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland's Philipp Schoch, who ran cleanly down a treacherous,
slippery course, won the gold; he beat Klug in the semifinals of the
day's head-to-head competition. Sweden's Richard Richardsson took
silver.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's parallel giant slalom event, also held Friday at
Park City Mountain Resort, France's Isabelle Blanc defeated teammate
Karine Ruby to earn the gold medal. Ruby had won gold four years ago
at Nagano but appeared to tire in Friday's finals. Italy's Lidia
Trettel won the bronze. The sole American in the women's final round,
Lisa Kosglow, 28, of Boise, Idaho, was eliminated in the
quarterfinals, losing to Ruby.</TE>
<TE>   Klug's medal is the first for the United States in Olympic
snowboard slalom racing. Earlier this week, U.S. snowboarders won
four medals in halfpipe, two of them gold.</TE>
<TE>   His bronze also pushed the United States' total of medals won at
the Salt Lake City Games to 14--surpassing the U.S. team's previous
best at a Winter Olympics, 13, at both Nagano in 1998 and Lillehammer
in 1994. U.S. Olympic officials are aiming for 20 or more medals at
these Games.</TE>
<TE>   Just as in traditional ski racing, the slalom event in
snowboarding involves going downhill through a series of gates as
fast as possible.</TE>
<TE>   The twist in parallel giant slalom--which both men's and women's
events were at these Games, for the first time--is that the
competitors race against each other in a series of heats. You win,
you keep going; lose, you're out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm lucky to be here today," Klug had said after qualifying for
Friday's final round. Diagnosed several years ago with the same
illness that killed Chicago Bear running back Walter Payton in 1999,
Klug's liver began to fail in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   That July, at a hospital in Denver, he received a transplant. He
had been on a waiting list for years. He did not receive any special
treatment because, for instance, he had finished sixth in the
snowboarding slalom finals in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   The donor was a 13-year-old boy. He had been shot in the head and
left brain-dead by a 14-year-old neighbor in what was later described
as an accident. Klug consistently has paid tribute to the family of
13-year-old Billy Flood. Here he called them "the real heroes."</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of his life, Klug has to take special medication--now
it's two drugs, three times daily--to ensure that his body does not
reject the liver. Nonetheless, only months after the transplant,
Klug, with the help of Bill Fabrocini, director of the sports
performance center at the Aspen Club, was back snowboard racing--and
winning on the World Cup circuit.</TE>
<TE>   The odds of that happening, doctors said, were astronomical. Sean
Elliott of the San Antonio Spurs came back from a kidney transplant
to play again in the NBA. But the liver is a far more complicated
transplant.</TE>
<TE>   The only other comparable case, doctors say, is that of cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who has come back from testicular cancer to win the
Tour de France three times. Klug met Armstrong before the opening
ceremony at the Games, and called it "quite a treat."</TE>
<TE>   During the opening ceremony, Klug was selected as one of the U.S.
athletes who would carry the tattered World Trade Center flag into
the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday's qualifying round, the top 16 went on to Friday's
finals. In the first round, Klug defeated Canada's Jerome Sylvestre.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, he slipped in the first of two heats against
Italy's Walter Feichter, the bronze medalist at last year's World
Championships, and found himself behind by .75 of a second. But in
the second heat, Feichter skidded out.</TE>
<TE>   Also falling, in other heats, were Thursday's top three
qualifiers: Switzerland's Gilles Jacquet, Austria's Alexander Maier
and Sweden's Daniel Biveson.</TE>
<TE>   The course Thursday was what the riders call "grippy"; on Friday
it was icy.</TE>
<TE>   In the semifinals, against Schoch, Klug wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   Then, with a medal on the line, he defeated France's Nicolas Huet,
a two-time world champion in the parallel events--even though a
buckle on Klug's left boot broke in the first of two races. He fixed
it with duct tape.</TE>
<TE>   In the first head-to-head race against Huet, Klug crossed the
finish line .15 of a second ahead, then topped that by beating him by
1.21 seconds in the second run.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward he offered thanks to his family, coaches, teammates, the
donor family, everyone who had helped achieve "my victory today."</TE>
<TE>   He stopped and paused, thinking about the word "victory." He said,
"Third place. Bronze. It's a victory for me."</TE>

<LD>Americans are routinely criticized around the world for an inability
to manage any language but English. A sign outside the Main Media
Center in downtown Salt Lake City is sure to give ammunition to such
critics.</LD>
<LD>   The sign is printed in English and French, the two official
languages of the International Olympic Committee. In big letters, in
English, it offers directions to an "East Gate" and a "South Gate."
In French, in smaller letters underneath, both "East Gate" and "South
Gate" are inexplicably referred to as "Porte Nord."</LD>
<LD>   "Nord" is French for "north."</LD>

<TE>   Real Heady Experience</TE>
<TE>   The opening-ceremony berets may be the hot headgear for American
fans, but other countries are looking more than a little weird in
their chapeaus of choice at the speedskating venue.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians have a snappy little knit number in the shape of a
maple leaf. Red, naturally.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the Dutch. Speedskating is the national sport in
Holland and Netherlanders turn out in droves for every race--wearing
the orangest orange they can find. The Dutch wear orange crowns. They
wear orange wigs--fright wigs and that ever-engaging rug with the
dangling orange braids. Some wear orange animals.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the preponderance of Wisconsin skaters on the U.S.
team--Casey FitzRandolph, Kip Carpenter, Chris Witty, Elli Ochowicz
and Catherine Raney--the Utah Olympic Oval would seem a haven for
foam cheeseheads. Alas, not a cheesehead has been seen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bend Your Mind</TE>
<TE>   OK, what language is this?</TE>
<TE>   We quote from a press release describing an Olympic event:</TE>
<TE>   " ... is having to deliver the game's final granite."</TE>
<TE>   " ... take one with the hammer in the first."</TE>
<TE>   " ... drew for one against three counters in the sixth."</TE>
<TE>   " ... executed a triple takeout to thwart."</TE>
<TE>   " ... could attempt to draw the four-foot."</TE>
<TE>   " ... her rock could be hidden behind much cover, especially with
the ice running fairly straight."</TE>
<TE>   " ... her shot struck front guards and rolled harmlessly."</TE>
<TE>   If you said curling, you win a broom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Air Supply</TE>
<TE>   From a Salt Lake weather report--does this sound familiar?</TE>
<TE>   "The ground will gradually become filled with fog and haze,
further reducing visibility and ... "</TE>
<TE>   " It becomes difficult or impossible to see the nearby mountains."</TE>
<TE>   "There will be many days when visibility would be reduced by fog
and haze..."</TE>
<TE>   Here, they call that an inversion layer. In Southern California,
there is another term. Smog.</TE>

<TE>   Where ABBA?</TE>
<TE>   Canada's fans made up the majority of the crowd at the E Center
for the Canada-Sweden hockey game, but once Sweden took a 4-1 lead in
the second period (on the way to a 5-2 victory), it was much easier
to hear the small pockets of yellow-and-blue clad Swedish fans.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly noisy group chanted in Swedish, although the
melodies were recognizable to almost any American. They chanted to
the tune of "Stars and Stripes Forever," "If You're Happy and You
Know It Clap Your Hands," "Yellow Submarine" and the lyric-less
chorus to "Buffalo Soldier."</TE>
<TE>   And, feeling the international spirit (or perhaps feeling
comfortable with their lead and hoping for a closer game) they even
joined the Canadian fans in chanting "Let's Go Canada."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Familiar Tune</TE>
<TE>   The Russian men's hockey team gave high marks to the return of its
nation's old national anthem. Russian President Vladimir Putin
restored what had been the music to the old Soviet anthem in 2000,
but with different words. Many Russians remember the old lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to hear the old anthem," center Alexei Yashin said.
"It brought back memories of all of our great teams."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Slava Fetisov, who played on many of the Soviet Union's
powerful teams during the 1980s, even took a good-natured jab at the
Canadians, who were the Russians' chief rivals for hockey supremacy
during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed hearing it," Fetisov said. "We had many victories under
this anthem. We all know it--and any Canadian player at any time of
day or night will be able to hum the Soviet anthem again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Royal Rumble</TE>
<TE>   Prince Albert of Monaco has a score to settle when he competes in
a record fifth Olympics in the four-man bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   His goal is to beat a quartet from Hungary, with a magnum of
champagne at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Adding color to the rivalry, two members of the Hungarian team
live in London and met by accident while jogging.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Frankl, 30, whose father fled Hungary in 1956, became
fascinated by the bobsled in 1992 while watching it on TV during the
Albertville Games.</TE>
<TE>   He decided to form his own Hungarian team and, by coincidence,
found his brakeman when he ran into another London-born Hungarian
while jogging.</TE>
<TE>   "On our travels, we met Prince Albert in Norway. He was extremely
generous, lending us tools and equipment," Frankl was quoted as
saying in London's Evening Standard on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   All of this has backfired on Prince Albert, at 43 the oldest
bobsled driver in this year's Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Frankl's team finished 28th at Lillehammer, while the Monaco
foursome placed 43rd.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later at Nagano, Frankl beat the Prince by two places.
Now they're heading for showdown No. 3. The two-day event begins next
Friday.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Polishes Off Finnish</HD>
<DH>The American men's team finds some cohesiveness and gets
off to a good start with a 6-0 victory over Finland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>If the United States hockey team wants to erase the bad memories of
Nagano, when the Americans left with tarnished reputations and no
medals, it's off to a good start.</LD>
<LD>   One game into the 2002 Olympics, Team USA has already matched the
number of victories in 1998 and is more than halfway toward reaching
the total of 10 goals thanks to a 6-0 victory over Finland on Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a lot to prove to everyone this year," forward Doug
Weight said. "In that room is a huge group of professionals. I know
that, and everyone in there believes it. We believe we can compete
with anyone in the world, and we plan on trying to win the gold
medal."</LD>
<TE>   It's only the second time this group has been together, but by the
end of the night it was already starting to look more like a team
than a bunch of All-Stars. By the third period the passing was
sharper, the teamwork better.</TE>
<TE>   "I think as the game progressed we were starting to become a
little more solid and started to do a lot more things that we wanted
to do and execute a lot better," John LeClair said. "Hopefully that
will continue."</TE>
<TE>   LeClair had a hat trick, including two goals in classic LeClair
fashion when he set up shop next to the net and refused to move.</TE>
<TE>   The players had little trouble adapting to international play.
Coach Herb Brooks made overall speed a priority in selecting the
team, and at times the Americans looked as if they were trying to
qualify for the Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks hates defensive hockey, where the players skate backward
"more than Peggy Fleming."</TE>
<TE>   Right from the outset Team USA tried to go up-tempo, especially
with the starting line of Mike Modano, Bill Guerin and Tony Amonte on
the ice.</TE>
<TE>   That helped to generate 13 shots in the first period, but no
goals. A shot by Brett Hull hit the post with a few seconds left in
the period.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the second period the fans were getting edgy, like
little kids at a movie waiting for the kissing scene to get over so
the action can start. They cranked up a "U-S-A!" chant.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Scott Young gave them what they craved. He took a pass
from Brian Rolston, broke clear and beat Finnish goalie Jani Hurme to
the glove side.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans started to enter attack mode. A Hull shot deflected
off Hurme's stick and right to LeClair, who deposited the puck in the
net.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Tkachuk scored the night's prettiest goal when he flew down
the left side, pulled the puck back (causing Finnish defenseman Kimmo
Timonen to spin around), then fired it past Hurme.</TE>
<TE>   There were some moments when the United States looked like a team
that had practiced together for only 45 minutes. Hull and Tkachuk
tried to set up in the same spot on the power play. Brooks, who
hadn't coached a team since a brief stint at the helm of the
Pittsburgh Penguins two seasons ago, even called for a player to go
in, only to be told, "He's in the [penalty] box."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks' choice of Mike Dunham to start in goal was a mild
surprise. Most observers thought he would pick the New York Rangers'
Mike Richter.</TE>
<TE>   But Richter had played four games in eight days, then had to
travel to Salt Lake on Thursday. The Nashville Predators' schedule
allowed Dunham to reach town by Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel comfortable with all three of our goalkeepers," Brooks
said. "We just felt that Richter had been playing an awful lot of
hockey. Tommy Barrasso was fine. We just felt that Dunham probably
was on a little bit more of a roll than the other two coming into
this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Good call. Dunham had a shutout, making 23 saves. He didn't allow
a demoralizing first goal, then didn't allow Finland to get back in
the game once the U.S. started rolling.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is winning, Brooks is making the right decisions
and the United States plays Russia tonight. It's starting to feel a
little more like 1980 than 1998.</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW</KH>
<HD>Speedskater Blair Is Taking It Slow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Bonnie Blair is glad her speedskating career ended before the
clap-skate era dawned in 1998 and skaters had to adapt to the new
gear, in which the heel of the blade isn't attached to the boot and
the toe is attached with a hinge.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a pair of the clap skates," Blair said, "but I've never
lit it up."</LD>
<LD>   Blair lit up three Olympics with triumphant performances--and the
exuberance of the "Blair Bunch," the friends and relatives who
followed her to every competition and unabashedly roared. She gave
them plenty to cheer about: Blair was the first American to win six
medals in the Winter Olympics and the first American woman to win
five gold medals in Winter or Summer Games.</LD>
<TE>   Now 37, Blair skates at a slower speed, with her two young
children. She and her husband, Dave Cruikshank, have a 3-year-old
son, Grant, and a 11/2-year-old daughter, Blair. They have a home
near Milwaukee but spent most of the fall and winter in a rented
condominium not far from the Olympic Oval in Kearns, Utah, while
Cruikshank tried one last time to win an Olympic berth using the
relatively new skates.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't make the team, but Blair considers him a winner, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "He went 36.01, which was his fastest time ever," she said. "To be
able to go faster than he's ever gone....I'm very proud of him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never gotten as much out of the clap skates as he could
have.... I don't think I would have been as patient going through the
change with the skates."</TE>
<TE>   Still in demand as a corporate spokeswoman, Blair attended the
Games on behalf of various companies and was among the final
torchbearers who carried the Olympic flame into Rice-Eccles Stadium
for the opening ceremony last week.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged being "very envious and jealous" of skaters on
the current U.S. team because they're competing at home, which she
never got to do.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's Olympic career began in 1984 at Sarajevo, where she
finished eighth in the 500. She also competed at the 1988 Calgary
Games, where she won gold in the 500 and bronze in the 1,000, at the
1992 Albertville Games, where she won gold in the 500 and 1,000, and
at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, where she won gold in the 500 and
1,000.</TE>
<TE>   She retired after Lillehammer but says she has no regrets. "Yes, I
miss it," she said, "but I'm happy with my life now."</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the board of directors of U.S. Speedskating, Blair
remains involved in the sport. She welcomes the influx of former
in-line skaters such as Jennifer Rodriguez and Derek Parra into
speedskating and isn't surprised at their rapid success.</TE>
<TE>   "For them, the transition to clap skates was easier than everybody
else," she said. "They're already used to making changes.... Someone
like my husband or Cory Carpenter [who didn't make the team either],
who has been around forever, it was hardest for them."</TE>

<HD>A Much Happier Place on Earth</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With Disney committed and a solid lineup, Angels
have reasons to be optimistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Angels hold their first workout of spring training today, kicking
off a camp nearly free of competition and full of tranquillity.
Everyone wants to be here, and what were the odds of that last fall?</LD>
<LD>   The players and the fans were fed up with each other, the players
ripping the beloved rally monkey, a three-game series in September
attracting a total of 40,000 fans, and the Angels losing their final
seven games and 19 of their last 21 to finish a franchise-worst 41
games out of first place.</LD>
<LD>   Slugger Mo Vaughn didn't want to be here, publicly appealing for
liberation from the Angels on a Boston radio station before bothering
to tell the team. All-Star closer Troy Percival didn't want to be
here, vowing to play out the final year of his contract and then
leave as a free agent after blaming the team for disclosing details
of failed negotiations for an extension. Tony Tavares didn't want to
be here, spending the final months of his team presidency negotiating
his own buyout. And Disney didn't want to be here, hoping desperately
to sell the Angels to Florida Marlin owner John Henry, a buyer
hand-picked by Commissioner Bud Selig.</LD>
<TE>   In November, Henry jilted Disney, deciding the floundering Angels
weren't worth a premium price and instead joining the group that
bought the Boston Red Sox. Paul Pressler, Tavares' boss, then decided
Disney ought to play to win so long as it owned the Angels, and he
directed General Manager Bill Stoneman to abandon a trade that would
have sent outfielder Darin Erstad to the Chicago White Sox for
prospects. The Dodgers insist--and Stoneman denies--the Angels also
abandoned a three-for-one trade for Percival.</TE>
<TE>   On back-to-back days in December, the Angels spent $24 million on
pitcher Aaron Sele, the second-largest free-agent purchase in
franchise history, then dispatched Vaughn to the New York Mets for
right-hander Kevin Appier, another veteran starter. In January,
Tavares resigned, and within hours Percival's agent said his client
might just stick around. The Angels filled a five-year vacancy by
acquiring a designated hitter, Brad Fullmer, who wanted to play at
home on the West Coast as much as Vaughn wanted to play at home on
the East Coast. Two weeks ago, Percival signed a two-year contract
extension for $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This commitment level that Disney and the Angels have made is
beyond anything that I've experienced since I've been with the
Angels," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   So, with a tip of the new red caps to Disney, welcome to one of
the happiest places on Earth. This could have been one of the ugliest
camps in the major leagues--Vaughn declaring his distaste for the
designated hitter role the Angels intended for him to fill and
uncomfortably facing teammates alienated by his loud dissatisfaction
despite his $80-million contract, Percival quietly counting down the
days until free agency, assorted players sniping about corporate
neglect.</TE>
<TE>   But now, in addition to showing off their new uniform, the Angels
actually have players happy to wear it.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman got a hint of fans' anticipation when he spoke this week
to a civic group in Tempe, the team's spring home.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see the glow on the faces of these people," Stoneman
said. "And these are not people from the Anaheim area. These are
Phoenix-area people. And they've picked up on it. It goes beyond the
California border."</TE>
<TE>   Excitement beats lethargy and frustration, but by itself it does
not beat the Seattle Mariners or Oakland Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners tied a major league record with 116 victories in
winning the American League West. The A's won 102 games and the
wild-card entry to the playoffs, finishing 14 games behind
Seattle--and 27 ahead of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels never have won 100 games and last won as many as 90 in
1989. Their solid starting rotation affords them the chance to win 90
this season, if Erstad and Tim Salmon recover from miserable seasons
and if outfielder Garret Anderson and third baseman Troy Glaus do not
regress.</TE>
<TE>   But those are questions for the regular season. There are no
questions this spring, at least not with respect to winning a
starting job. The only competition for roster spots, barring injury
or trade, involves the last guy on the bench and the last guy in the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Sele and Appier join Jarrod Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott
Schoeneweis in the starting rotation. In relief, Percival will be
supported by Al Levine, Dennis Cook, Ben Weber, Lou Pote and one of
at least a half-dozen candidates for the remaining spot.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson will play left field, Erstad center and Salmon right,
with Orlando Palmeiro backing up the outfielders. Glaus will play
third, David Eckstein shortstop, Adam Kennedy second base and Scott
Spiezio and Shawn Wooten will share first, with Benji Gil backing up
the infielders. Bengie Molina and Jorge Fabregas will catch and
Fullmer will DH, with Clay Bellinger, Jeff DaVanon and Jose Nieves
competing for a utility spot.</TE>
<TE>   With the roster remarkably set, Manager Mike Scioscia plans to use
the spring to determine a set lineup. He used 130 lineups last year,
more than all but one team in the league, trying frantically to shove
his offense into hitting gear.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to settle on a consistent offensive club that's going to
be able to support what we feel is an outstanding pitching staff,"
Scioscia said. "You want to get that offensive chemistry lined up,
and that's going to take some work and some time."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, they'll whistle while they work.</TE>

<LD>Ken Davidoff of Newsday commenting on the transformation of pitcher
David Wells: "How fitting. In this year of the Yankees' overhaul,
even their one new player who isn't really new looks and talks like a
new person. At least for now, it's a kinder, gentler Boomer as well
as a thinner one [by about 30 pounds].</LD>
<LD>   "Take, for instance, the Metallica music he used to blast on the
days he pitched, the music that Joe Torre admittedly loathed during
Wells' first Yankees' stay in 1997-98.</LD>
<LD>   "That music will no longer take over the Yankees' clubhouse every
five days, Wells has said.... Instead, he'll just listen to it on his
headphones."</LD>

the end of the first quarter. There were thousands of empty seats
throughout the building. The most faithful and honest fans in the
world are rightfully frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin, have you researched the faithfulness and honesty of all
fans in the world?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't sell: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Nike was worried that a messy divorce settlement might require them
to launch the new [Michael] Jordan shoe under the name ... Air
Alimony."</TE>

<TE>   One too many? Comedy writer Jerry Perisho:</TE>
<TE>   "Minnesota star Kevin Garnett bought drink tickets and had them
distributed to the first 10,000 fans at Wednesday's game. Each ticket
was good for a free beer.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't that what sports is all about ... one more free beer on a
work night, right before getting on the freeway for the drive home?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Open wide: There was a picture on this page of Wednesday's paper
showing Mo Vaughn of the Mets hunkering over a giant "Mo-Licious
Sandwich" at a New York deli. Mo wasn't exactly enthusiastic about
the endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "To endorse this sandwich is not really the message I want to send

it home and eat it for a week."</TE>

Todd Hundley hired a nutritionist, watched what he ate and lost 12

<TE>   He acknowledged boos from fans at Wrigley Field provided
motivation, but he isn't complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been booed by 40,000 at Shea Stadium and by 60,000 in L.A.
That's part of the game," he said. "I deserved it. You get booed, it

Wildcat Coach Lute Olson's reaction to Thursday night's 77-76 loss to
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion: "As Olson left the interview room, someone

<HD>Padres' Darr Dies in Car Accident</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Passenger also killed in one-car crash in
Phoenix. Alcohol appears to be a factor, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego Padre outfielder Mike Darr and longtime friend Duane
Johnson, son of UCLA defensive line coach Don Johnson, were killed
and a passenger was injured in an automobile accident early Friday in
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Darr, 25, was driving and alcohol appeared to be
a factor in the one-car accident, in which the vehicle rolled across
three lanes of freeway and crashed through a fence, coming to rest on
a frontage road.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Valenzuela, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public
Safety, said Darr and Johnson, 23, were not wearing seat belts and
were ejected. Ben Howard, a 23-year-old pitcher in the Padres' minor
league organization, was in the back seat and was wearing a seat
belt. He was treated at the scene for scrapes and bruises and
released.</LD>
<TE>   The accident occurred at 2 a.m. (MST), only hours before the
Padres began training for the 2002 season in nearby Peoria, Ariz.
Friday was the voluntary reporting date for pitchers and catchers.</TE>
<TE>   Darr and Johnson were childhood friends who grew up in Corona in
Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "They were as close as brothers," said Derek Robbins, a football
assistant who coached Johnson at Corona High.</TE>
<TE>   Darr, a 1995 Corona graduate, still used the school's weight room
and baseball field for off-season workouts, and had recently
purchased a house in his hometown, said Corona football Coach John
Brandom.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson played football and baseball at Corona before spending his
senior year at Reno's Wooster High, graduating in 1997. He played one
season with the Philadelphia Phillies' minor league organization but
was no longer affiliated with a pro team. He was planning to play
football in the fall for Fullerton College, where he was a defensive
back and kick-return specialist on the 1999 team.</TE>
<TE>   Darr lived with the Johnson family for a time in Reno. Don Johnson
was a football assistant for five seasons at the University of Nevada
in Reno before coming to UCLA before the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Don Johnson could not be reached for comment. Marc Dellins, UCLA's
sports information director, said he spoke Friday with Johnson, who
expressed he did not want to make a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an emotional time, obviously," Dellins said.</TE>
<TE>   The Padre organization was shaken by the death of Darr, who was
their opening-day starter in 2001--his first full major league
season--and started 69 games, 24 in center field and 45 in right.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost a special teammate, a special person," relief pitcher
Trevor Hoffman said. "There are a lot of heavy hearts in the locker
room."</TE>
<TE>   Said Padre Manager Bruce Bochy: "This is a very difficult thing to
begin spring training with."</TE>
<TE>   Darr was regarded as a good defensive player but didn't have much
hitting power. He hit only two home runs last season, but both were
game-winners in the Padres' last at-bat. He batted .277 with 34 runs
batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a pretty good year last year," Bochy said. "He could run,
he could throw, he could hit.... He was a fun-loving guy who played
the game like it was supposed to be played. He played all-out, and
that's going to be missed."</TE>
<TE>   Darr was the second player in the Padres' organization to be
killed in a car crash in less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   On July 29, minor league pitcher Gerik Baxter was killed near
Indio when a rear tire on his pickup blew out, causing the truck to
swerve into another car and roll several times. Passenger Mark Hilde,
a draft pick for the Oakland Athletics, also died.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Arizona said Darr apparently drifted into the dirt
center median, then overcorrected, causing the car to roll.</TE>
<TE>   Darr is survived by his wife, Natalie, and two sons, Mike Jr. and
Matthew.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Get Caught in Last Tangle</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Hawks hand L.A. seventh loss to a team at
or near bottom of standings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You keep digging yourself a hole, eventually you are going to get
buried.</LD>
<LD>   For the third consecutive time Friday, the Lakers stumbled through
the first half of a game, awoke as time was running out and put on a
spirited comeback.</LD>
<LD>   But this time, their wake-up call came too late, the Atlanta Hawks
holding them off for a 93-90 victory Friday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   It was the seventh loss for the Lakers against a team in the lower
depths of the league standings since Dec. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers cut a 19-point deficit to three with just over five
seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   But their slim hopes of pulling this one out faded when they
fouled a man who had made eight consecutive free throws in the game,
24 in succession overall.</TE>
<TE>   Shareef Abdur-Rahim smoothly sank the free throws that gave the
Hawks their first victory in Los Angeles in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Abdur-Rahim finished with 32 points, seven rebounds and six
assists.</TE>
<TE>   It was bound to happen the way the Lakers have been dribbling on
the edge of danger lately.</TE>
<TE>   With Shaquille O'Neal missing from the middle, they already lose
valuable ground. Inexplicably, they choose to make their task even
more difficult in O'Neal's absence by putting themselves in that
all-too-familiar hole.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, the Lakers went down by 20 points before pulling
out a victory over the Washington Wizards. Thursday night, they
struggled into the final two minutes before salvaging a victory over
the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   And Friday night, they were at it again.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the weariness of games on consecutive nights in in
different cities.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was mood of the crowd, which couldn't seem to get
interested in an opposing team with only a few recognizable names. It
was so quiet at Staples Center in the first half, you could hear
Coach Phil Jackson groan.</TE>
<TE>   And he had plenty to groan about.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal may not have been in the middle for the Lakers, but
neither, it appeared, was anybody else.</TE>
<TE>   Or in the backcourt.</TE>
<TE>   Offensively, the Lakers were able to score only 35 points against
one of the worst defensive teams in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Defensively, the Lakers were unable to protect the middle against
Abdur-Rahim, Nazr Mohammed, or Ira Newble.</TE>
<TE>   Ira Newble?</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he was playing for the Flint Fuze of the CBA.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Lakers were playing in the first half, they might not
have been able to beat the Fuze.</TE>
<TE>   "They played better than we did tonight," Jackson said. "They got
to loose balls and created situations for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't discredit your opponent. Atlanta is not a team that is
feared around the league, but they're still playing good basketball.
They won three out of four before tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were trailing, 85-70, when Slava Medvedenko scored two
quick baskets underneath. Then, the Lakers outside shooting kicked
in. Derek Fisher hit two big three-pointers, one of which turned into
a four-point play. Devean George, getting his first start of the
season, added two more three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   George's second three-pointer cut the deficit to just two points
with 25.5 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers got no closer.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, attempting to involve his teammates with O'Neal
sitting out his third consecutive game because of his chronic toe
injury, had 10 assists, along with 21 points, his third straight game
with double figures in assists.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher added 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not play a high, intense game until the end," said Lindsey
Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot come out and coast through a game and then try to turn
it up that late in the game. I think it just caught up with us
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "The first two or three quarters," he said, "we just didn't play
hard and there is no excuse for that."</TE>

<LD>I don't know about Kobe Bryant, but I certainly enjoyed the
Philadelphia fans' crescendo of boos. Would it be possible to send
the entire city of Philadelphia one giant tissue to wipe those
crocodile tears from their vanquished faces? Or maybe we can just
borrow one of the towels Kobe uses to dust his two NBA championship
trophies and All-Star MVP?</LD>

<TE>   If there was any doubt about Kobe Bryant being the best basketball
player on the planet, those doubts were quickly erased in a torrent
of boos, trophies and assists in a week of mastery the likes of which
this league has never seen.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations, Kobe; you wear the title well: Best Player in the
Game.</TE>

<TE>   Mark Heisler writes about Kobe Bryant being booed by Philadelphia
at the All-Star game. He writes about how the booing hurt Kobe's
feelings. He goes above and beyond to make it seem like this is only
a phenomenon that happens here. What he fails to mention is the way
L.A. treated Rob Blake just one week earlier at the NHL All-Star
game.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Fliszar</TE>
<TE>   Drexel Hill, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In regard to the bicoastal booing of All-Stars, there is a
difference. Philadelphia 76er fans booed native son Kobe Bryant at
the NBA All-Star game because they know that with him on their team,
they would be far superior.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, at the NHL All-Star game at Staples Center,
King fans booed former King Rob Blake every time he touched the puck
because they know that without him on their team, the Kings are a
much better team.</TE>
<TE>   76er fans are full of sour grapes and cannot define reason; King
fans are intelligent enough to recognize "addition by subtraction."</TE>
<TE>   Howard Cohen</TE>
<TE>   North Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think the media is broad-brushing this whole Kobe thing and
attributing the booing at the All-Star game to Philly fans. Why is it
never mentioned that only 4,000 tickets were available for 76er fans
and the other 15,000 were distributed by the NBA?</TE>
<TE>   The game and booing were in Philly, but I wouldn't necessarily say
it was all Philly fans booing Kobe. I think Kobe's act plays well in
L.A., but in other parts of the nation he is seen in a less than
positive light. I'm sure past behavior makes it easy to ignore some
facts and just point the finger at Philly fans.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe made a genuine effort to embrace Philly this time around and
I believe Philly is ready to hug back. That's why I think the booing
was as much, if not more, a national response than a Philly thing.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Evans</TE>
<TE>   Hermosa Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to thank Don Nelson for taking Kobe Bryant out of the
All-Star game. I love Kobe Bryant. But I got so upset with Kobe's
play Sunday that I was screaming for him to be taken out of the game.
He reverted back to his selfish, ball-hogging ways that had
characterized his play early in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Evans</TE>
<TE>   Compton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I had lived in Philadelphia for 53 years before I came to Fountain
Valley in 1985. As a loyal Philly fan I was frustrated by the
"booing" mentality of the fans in regard to Kobe Bryant. They used to
boo Mike Schmidt incessantly and he is arguably the greatest
all-around third baseman of all time.</TE>
<TE>   So, I am angry at their fans for booing Bryant. I root for the
Eagles, Phillies and Flyers. I do not like the 76ers since they
picked up Allen Iverson, because he always seemed like a "hot dog." I
have now changed my mind on him as he showed class in approaching
Kobe to congratulate him on his All-Star MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Herman</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I thought the audience's booing of Kobe Bryant throughout the game
and at the MVP presentation showed poor sportsmanship. But I forgot,
these are probably the same fans who cheered when Michael Irvin of
the Dallas Cowboys went down to a career-ending injury at an Eagle
home game. Next time, NBA, pick a classier venue. Don't waste your
money on that town.</TE>

<HD>Tiger's Absence Is Not Excused</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, the Tiger Woods Foundation conducted one of its few events
at Eldorado Park in Long Beach. More than 3,000 kids got to attend
the event. How many of those kids were looking forward to seeing
Tiger in person at this year's L.A. Open, and will now be
disappointed?</LD>
<LD>   I know having more money than you could ever spend, your own jet
and people doing you favors at every turn can be a real hassle. But
to deprive your hometown fans of the chance to see you play because
you're worn out from all of the golf you play is a little hard to
stomach. We want to see Tiger play even if he isn't at the top of his
game, and he owes it to all of the firsts that he enjoyed in L.A.
before he moved to Florida.</LD>

<LD>Quiz time: You're a major college basketball coach. Your team is
trailing by one on the road with about 10 seconds left. Your player
is 10 feet in front of you with the ball but in an awkward position.
Do you:</LD>
<LD>   A. Tell your player to call time out. B. Tell your player to pass
to one of the five best shooters in the country, who is open at the
top of the key. C. Jump up and down like a zoo animal.</LD>
<LD>   If you chose "A" or "B," you're likely one of about 250 Division I
coaches. If you chose "C," you're Steve Lavin.</LD>
<TE>   Craig Dunkin</TE>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I actually became physically ill when I read the Steve Lavin spin
piece "Me and My Shadow" in Thursday's sports section. This two-bit
huckster has sunk to a new low. To use the personal correspondence of
legendary John Wooden as a prop in a pathetic attempt to legitimize
his dismal basketball program is beyond the pale. Lavin's hideously
coached teams are the very antithesis of Wooden's superior
disciplined squads. He should be selling used cars, not coaching UCLA
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Johnson</TE>
<TE>   Culver City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson provides another attempt to raise Steve Lavin to
martyrdom status in his "Me and My Shadow" article. It's interesting
how he implies that UCLA's basketball expectations are
unrealistically high, yet having lofty expectations always seems more
acceptable for schools such as Duke, Kentucky and North Carolina. I
think the reality is, only a fanatic few truly expect UCLA to
approach or match the accomplishments of 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   What I also find interesting is that despite the number of Coach
Wooden's insights offered, one of his main tenets was excluded.
"Success is the satisfaction in knowing you did the best with which
you are capable." I think not living up to this principle has more to
do with the disappointment than simply a 17-7 record.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Chew</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is incredible how UCLA fans are calling for Steve Lavin's head
in the middle of the Pac-10 season. How soon we forget the Walt
Hazzard years.</TE>
<TE>   While Lavin does lose some conference games in the middle of the
season, his team always is at its best at the end of the year. As he
becomes more experienced, he will lead UCLA to the promised land. I'd
rather have Steve Lavin losing to Arizona in the middle of the season
and going to the Sweet 16 than being unbeatable during the season and
then losing in the first round like Roy Williams or Jim Boeheim does
every year.</TE>

<LD>   These downtrodden members of the proletariat always have the
option of suing the owners for collusion, as they have successfully
in the past. But perhaps in the few days remaining before reporting
to Florida and Arizona for spring training they can take a quick side
trip to Houston and meet with former Enron employees. I'm certain
they could co-found a collusion victims group--provided the players
lend the Enron employees the initiation dues.</LD>

<LD>   My husband showed me the picture of USC's new uniforms and
explained the "major" changes that were made. I am appalled. Not only
are the changes minor, but the uniforms were ugly in 1971 and they
are just as ugly now. How can I take sports seriously if they won't
let the players dress better?</LD>

<HD>Murray Hurt in Auto Crash</HD>
<DH>Hockey: King coach suffers broken ribs after his truck
slides off icy highway two hours from his home in Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While driving to see his son play in a youth hockey tournament in
Wisconsin, King Coach Andy Murray was involved in a single-car
accident early Friday morning and suffered four broken ribs and a
possible shoulder separation.</LD>
<LD>   "I was fortunate that I had my seat belt on or I wouldn't have
made it," said Murray, who had returned to his family's home in
Faribault, Minn., once the NHL's Winter Olympic break began Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Murray left Faribault at 4 a.m. Friday and two hours later his
truck slid and rolled off an icy road down an embankment 300 feet
from a highway in Sparta, Wis.</LD>
<TE>   "The roads were pretty good at first and I was just driving along
for a couple of hours when all of the sudden, I came along this patch
of ice," Murray said. "My truck hit the ice and there wasn't any bite
at all [with the tires] and I started weaving from side to side. I
then hit this embankment where it dropped down and I thought I was
gone. People driving behind me said that they thought I rolled four
or five times."</TE>
<TE>   Murray had to kick open a window to free himself from the truck.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, I was by myself," said Murray, 50, whose Kings are
in sixth place in the Western Conference with 65 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I was conscious the whole time. I remember the truck
starting to roll over the first time and then everything happened
really fast. I knew I had to get out of the truck."</TE>
<TE>   After being held in a Sparta hospital for most of the day, Murray
was picked up by his wife, Ruth, who drove him back to Minnesota
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that anyone had seen me," Murray said. "One of the
truck drivers did and they brought an ambulance to bring me into
town. My shoulder is real sore and they don't know what is wrong. I'm
going to see another doctor where I live. I'm going to get it checked
out."</TE>
<TE>   Murray is in his third season with the Kings and has a 104-79-40
record.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the Kings, Murray coached the Canadian national
team from 1996-98, leading them to the gold medal in the 1997 world
hockey championships.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1998-99 season, Murray split time as head coach for
Shattuck-St. Mary's in Faribault, where he led the prep school to a
70-9-2 record and the midget triple-A U.S. hockey national
championship, and as general manager at Koln of the German Hockey
League.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who do not play again until Feb. 26 at Columbus, will
start a four-day mini-camp Feb. 21 at their El Segundo practice
facility.</TE>
<TE>   You can expect Murray to be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I'm pretty fortunate," Murray said. "I'll be back in
L.A. on Wednesday. I'm going to be a little sore, but I'm fine."</TE>

<LD>Tampa Bay's meandering, monthlong search for a coach headed in yet
another direction Friday when the Buccaneers received permission to
talk to San Francisco's Steve Mariucci.</LD>
<LD>   The sons of Buccaneer owner Malcolm Glazer are interested in
hiring Mariucci as coach and general manager, dual responsibilities
that haven't been offered to previous candidates. Tony Dungy was
fired Jan. 14 as coach.</LD>
<LD>   Mariucci has two years remaining on his contract as San
Francisco's coach, meaning Tampa Bay would have to work out a trade
that could involve draft picks, players, cash or a combination of the
three.</LD>
<TE>   "We gave Steve permission to go and talk to Tampa Bay because this
is an opportunity that is unique," 49er General Manager Terry Donahue
said. "If it had just been for a head coaching position, my own
personal belief, is that we would not have granted [permission]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Lions expect to release quarterback Charlie Batch on
June 1 if he isn't selected by the Houston Texans in Monday's
expansion draft. The date is critical because the Lions would have to
count an extra $5 million against this year's $71.8-million salary
cap if he is released before then.... Bill Arnsparger, 75, who gave
Marty Schottenheimer his first NFL coaching job, was hired by
Schottenheimer as the San Diego Chargers' associate head coach for
defense.... Seven-time all-pro Willie Roaf says he has irreconcilable
differences with New Orleans Saint Coach Jim Haslett and would rather
retire than play any longer for the team.</TE>

but missed an eight-footer on No. 14. Gary Player holds the age

in the quarterfinals. Magnus Larsson, who won the tournament in 1992,
defeated Novak, 6-3, 6-2, and will meet Olivier Rochus in the
semifinals. Rochus defeated Schuettler, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5.... Monica

<HD>There's Another Tiger Running Free at Riviera</HD>
<DH>Golf: In Japan, Taniguchi has same nickname as Woods, and
at Nissan Open he's playing like him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget what you've read. Not only is Tiger playing in the Nissan
Open, he's leading the thing.</LD>
<LD>   Just not the Tiger you might think.</LD>
<LD>   Toru Taniguchi, nicknamed the Japanese Tiger by reporters in his
homeland, shot a four-under-par 67 on Friday to claim a one-stroke
lead over Jesper Parnevik, Brad Faxon, Scott McCarron and Len
Mattiace, who charged up the leaderboard late in the day with birdies
on his last four holes.</LD>
<TE>   Taniguchi, aided by a translator, gave soft, one-word answers to
reporters after his round. Later, when the subject of his nickname
came up, he humbly waved his hand in front of his face, lowered his
head and recoiled like a backspinning Titleist. Ah, humility.</TE>
<TE>   Thing is, when he's playing on the Japan Golf Tour, Taniguchi
greets every birdie with a Tiger Woods fist pump, wears red shirts on
must-win days, and beamed on the first tee last year when he was
introduced as Toru "Tiger" Taniguchi.</TE>
<TE>   At the Buick Open last week, he played in the group immediately in
front of Woods, and, at that tournament last year, he was one group
behind him. So Taniguchi has had a taste of the PGA Tour's answer to
Woodstock.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as Tiger finished the hole, all the gallery was gone,"
Taniguchi said, almost looking incredulous. "I want to play a little
better golf so I can get them to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Woods pulled out of the Nissan Open to recover from flu, but the
tournament still drew a second-day crowd of 22,494, respectably large
in tour terms. The weather was pristine, slightly warmer than
Thursday, and several golfers said the greens were in tremendous
shape.</TE>
<TE>   The way Faxon plays Riviera, he might never want to leave. He shot
a 63 here during the 1995 PGA Championship, including a 28 on the
front with five birdies and an eagle. He finished fifth in that
tournament, precisely what he needed to make the Ryder Cup team. So
Riviera feels like an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice because you kind of relive some of the shots you hit,"
he said. "You feel like you know the course, the bounces, what's
going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Faxon didn't need any local knowledge on his two best shots of
this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He holed out a wedge from 80 yards for an eagle Thursday, and
Friday repeated the feat for birdie from 30 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Just as comfortable at Riviera is McCarron, a 1988 UCLA graduate,
who drove the green on the par-four, 315-yard 10th hole--almost
everyone else played it safe with an iron--then sank a 36-foot putt
for eagle. That was the start of a back nine that included two
birdies and six pars. When he was a Bruin, he played Riviera roughly
once a month, even though it was USC's home course.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel this is a golf course [where] I can win it," he
said. "There are just some golf courses you feel comfortable with."</TE>
<TE>   Parnevik, the first-round leader, was more steady than
spectacular. He followed a 65 with a 69, making birdie on his last
hole to stay within striking range.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Tway is two shots off the lead. Three shots back are David
Peoples, Tommy Armour III, J.J. Henry and David Duval, fresh off a
three-week snowboarding hiatus. Duval has won three times coming off
similar breaks, and once won after a 10-week layoff.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia, a fan favorite, was frustrated with his putting
Thursday after shooting an opening-round 73 and retired to the
practice green. Evidently, it paid off. He fired a 67 on
Friday--putting him seven shots off the lead--and did so with
fantastic putting and several impressive up-and-downs.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't hit that many good putts in a long time," he said.
"Even the ones I didn't make, they were great strokes. That gives me
a lot of confidence. Yesterday it was horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Several eye-catching names failed to make the cut--which was even
par--including Darren Clarke; Hal Sutton; Corey Pavin, who won here
in 1994 and '95; Matt Gogel, who won at Pebble Beach this year; and
J.L. Lewis, who finished second last weekend at La Jolla.</TE>

<LD>Mike Tyson's application to box in Texas was denied Friday, the
latest setback in the former heavyweight champion's attempt to get a
bout against Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported that the MCI Center in
Washington has emerged as a possible site.</LD>
<LD>   Washington "is not near the top of the list, it's at the top,"
said Tyson advisor Shelly Finkel.</LD>
<TE>   Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation Executive Director
Bill Kuntz said his decision was based on Tyson's history in the ring
and disciplinary action by other states.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my decision to deny Mr. Tyson a license based on his past
behavior in the ring, his unwillingness to follow the basic rules and
laws of boxing, and our mandate to regulate boxing in the public
interest," Kuntz said.</TE>

<DH>Half a Dozen Teams Are in Good Standing in Top-Heavy
Pac-10, and USC Could Be First--or Sixth--After Facing Arizona Today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Give California's Shantay Legans and UCLA's Billy Knight credit for
creating this mess.</LD>
<LD>   Take away the guards' buzzer-beating, game-winning three-point
baskets against USC this season, and the Trojans would be in first
place, two games up in the loss column on the rest of the Pacific 10.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Legans and Knight have helped create a six-team logjam
that has Arizona in first by half a game at 10-4 and a five-way tie
for second among USC, UCLA, Oregon, Stanford and California at 9-4.</LD>
<TE>   The 25th-ranked Trojans can break up the pack a bit today by
upending No. 9 Arizona at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the Wildcats and USC is most likely in a tie for first place
with four games to play in the regular season. Should the Trojans
lose, they probably fall to sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona faces the possibility of falling from first to sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have thought this was possible, but I knew this year
that every team is right there with equal strength," said USC senior
forward Sam Clancy. "Anybody can beat anybody on any given night so
I'm not too surprised with the way it is.</TE>
<TE>   "We still like where we're at. We just have to go out and play
hard, and we've got to get this one. The margin for error is very
slim. We can't afford any mental breakdowns."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans suffered a complete meltdown the last time they faced
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In USC's worst game of the season, the Wildcats ran out to a
31-point lead en route to a 97-80 win in Tucson on Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona employed a 3-2 zone defense that had 6-foot-8 Luke Walton
at the top disrupting passing lanes and daring USC to shoot from
outside.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans tried and failed ... miserably.</TE>
<TE>   USC made only one of its first nine shots, two of its first 22 and
five of its first 29 on its way to shooting 25.7% from the field in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to move the basketball," Trojan Coach Henry Bibby said.
"We're expecting they're going to play zone, so we need to get some
good looks."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has stressed that the way to beat a zone is to make open
shots from the wings, which are created by ball-handlers penetrating
the zone and then passing the ball out.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some gaps in their zone that we've seen the past
couple days watching tape," said USC senior point guard Brandon
Granville, who sat out Friday's practice because of a stiff left knee
after an on-court collision against Arizona State on Thursday night.
He said he expects to be ready to play today.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach has put in a couple of new plays, trying to attack those
specific areas," said Granville, who was scoreless against Arizona in
January.</TE>
<TE>   And with the streaky David Bluthenthal buoyed by his performance
Thursday, when he had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and freshman Errick
Craven's once-weary legs rested, Bibby is seemingly finished tweaking
his starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Against Arizona State, Bibby sat Bluthenthal and Craven, and
started sophomore Jerry Dupree and senior Gennaro Busterna. A return
to normality is expected today.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona is coming off an emotionally taxing 77-76 loss at UCLA in
which its two best players, Walton and junior point guard Jason
Gardner, each played 40 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to come out and kind of jump on them from the start,"
Granville said. "We need to come out and play well early for our own
confidence because we haven't played well the last couple of times
we've played them.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how much you say it doesn't affect you, it still feels
good to come out and play well in the beginning and get a lead or be
right there with them."</TE>

<LD>Former Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina, sidelined nearly two seasons
after shoulder surgery, agreed Friday to a minor league contract with
the Boston Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   DiSarcina played all nine of his major league seasons with the
Angels, but was sidelined since early May 2000 after playing only 12
games that year.</LD>

<TE>   Major league baseball had another legal loss in Minnesota when a
judge ordered the Twins and the commissioner's office to turn over
contraction-related documents to the Metrodome's operator within 60
days.</TE>
<TE>   Hennepin County District Judge Harry Seymour Crump ruled in favor
of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, which hopes to use
the internal baseball documents to build a case that would keep the
Twins in town beyond the 2002 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota pitcher Rick Reed won't play for the Twins this season
and will exercise his right to become a free agent if the team
doesn't trade him by March 15, his agent, Phil Tannenbaum, said....
Frank Catalanotto, who batted .330 in 133 games last season, agreed
to a one-year, $2.3-million contract with the Texas Rangers and
avoided salary arbitration.... Tampa Bay pitcher Esteban Yan lost his
salary arbitration case and will make $1.5 million this year instead
of $2.4 million.... Atlanta Brave shortstop Rafael Furcal is actually
23, two years older than thought, it was revealed after he
experienced visa problems in his native Dominican Republic.</TE>

Channel 56, 7, KRLA (870)--With three victories in five games, the
49ers are beginning to resemble the team that was expected to contend

their home loss to UC Irvine. Guard Markus Carr has a sprained big
toe on his right foot but is expected to start.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   UC Irvine (18-7, 11-3) at Pacific (14-9, 6-7), 7, KUCI-FM

percentage defense, with opponents shooting 36.7%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton (4-18, 1-12) at Idaho (8-15, 5-9),
7--Fullerton lost at Utah State for the 18th consecutive time, 60-45,

<TE>   UC Riverside (8-13, 5-8) at Utah State (19-4, 11-3), 7, KPRO
(1570)--Riverside has a two-game winning streak. The Highlanders beat
Fullerton last Saturday and defeated Idaho, 67-56, on Thursday as

scored 14 points in the Aggies' 60-45 victory over Fullerton on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount (9-16, 2-9) at Portland (5-20, 1-10), 7, KXLU

<TE>   UCLA (7-17, 3-12) at Arizona State (20-7, 11-5), 7, KACD (850),
KEWS (1350)--The Sun Devils moved back into second place in the
Pacific 10 after defeating USC on Thursday, and have posted
consecutive 20-win seasons for the first time since 1981-82 and
1982-83. UCLA guard Whitney Jones has averaged 18.6 points in her
last three games, including a career-high 24 in Thursday's loss at
Arizona.</TE>

<TE>   USC (13-11, 9-6) at Arizona (13-12, 9-7), 2--The Trojans may have
lost their chance at second place in the conference by losing to
Arizona State. Now they have to worry about being overtaken by the
sixth-place Wildcats, who defeated USC at the Sports Arena on Jan.
19. Trojan forward Rachel Woodard, who had 14 points against the Sun
Devils, continues to make a strong push for the conference freshman

<DH>Duval More at Peace with Himself Than Ever Before</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Duval thinks a great deal of his golf game, which is why he
wasn't surprised last July when he was holding up the Claret Jug at
Royal Lytham, where he had just won the British Open.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't want it to come out wrong and he knows it sounds
arrogant, but Duval says that when he finally won that first major
title, he was, well, proud of himself. Because as he stood tall on
one of golf's grandest stages, he knew he was exactly where he
belonged.</LD>
<LD>   Duval is 30 and a far cry from the shy, pudgy kid from Florida who
turned pro in 1995. This Duval is different than the younger version,
because if we've learned anything from following Duval, it's that he
is constantly remaking himself. And you would have to say he's done a
good job.</LD>
<TE>   This Duval is now the shy, thin guy from Florida who has become
one of the most compelling stories in golf, almost totally by
accident, mostly because he really hasn't cared to reveal much of
what's inside him. There is this image of him, looking at the world
from a safe distance, from behind his trademark wraparound shades.
This could create a confusing comparison. Many people aren't
recognized when they put on shades. Duval isn't recognized when he
takes his off.</TE>
<TE>   That's not altogether true anymore. For some reason--maybe because
his smiles come easier, or the after effects of winning a major
championship--Duval looks and sounds more at peace with himself and
the world than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long and challenging road for Duval, who sometimes
got the wrong kind of feedback when he did open up and wound up
getting his feelings hurt. The worst example was in 1999 before the
Ryder Cup, when the issue of compensation for the U.S. players was
brought up and Duval was portrayed in many circles as a greedy
ingrate.</TE>
<TE>   His message had been nothing of the sort. Duval had suggested that
since the Ryder Cup had long grown out of its garden party image and
become a moneymaking monster, the players should have some say in
where the profit goes. Charities would be fine, Duval said, but that
part of his answer was overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   It was about the same time, the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie,
when Duval was quoted making critical comments about the course. The
setup was a joke, to be sure, but Duval insisted he hadn't said so
and that a British reporter taking notes of his comments had
misinterpreted him. At one point, his representatives even suggested
he take special training to build a better relationship with the
media.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Ryder Cup and Carnoustie incidents happened when Duval
was No. 1 in the world, knocking Tiger Woods out of the top spot for
the only time in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   What you have to understand about Duval is that he was winning
just about everything in sight even while all this was going on. In
1997, he won his last three events and finished second on the money
list. In 1998, he won four more times, led the money list and had the
lowest scoring average on tour. And in 1999, he became the first
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, Duval has won 13 times and finished second
12 times. He has won one major and might have won three more at the
Masters, where he was second in 1998 and 2001 and third in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   All this has brought him fame and fortune, with more than $15
million in prize money and millions more in endorsements. If you
don't count Woods, and that's not easy to do, Duval might be the most
visible pitchman in golf equipment advertising.</TE>
<TE>   And, possibly for the first time, it has also made him happy.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he did it his own way, which is the only way Duval
knows. He broke up with longtime girlfriend Julie McArthur, withdrew
from the Phoenix Open, didn't play Pebble Beach or Torrey Pines and
showed up at the driving range at Riviera Country Club on Tuesday,
smacking golf balls until his hands hurt.</TE>
<TE>   It must have worked because Duval is right there among the leaders
at the Nissan Open. After rounds of 67 and 69, Duval is only three
shots off the lead. That's not bad for someone who hasn't been on a
golf course for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, not playing seems to get Duval in the proper mood to
succeed. He was idle most of the off-season before the 1999 Mercedes
Championships and won by nine. Because of a back injury, he took 10
weeks off after the 2000 British Open at St. Andrews and won the
Buick Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Last year before the Masters, he was off five weeks because of a
wrist injury, shot a 67 on Sunday and Woods beat him by two shots.</TE>
<TE>   Duval says he doesn't plan to change his ways. If he doesn't feel
fresh, he's out of here. He says he isn't playing to finish 30th or
to make cuts or to make a few dollars. The idea is to win more
tournaments, hopefully more majors. Then he can wait to see what's
written about him.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy for Duval to admit he's more comfortable with
himself than ever and, in fact, he can't admit it. Maybe he can do it
sometime soon. He says he's just growing up, like everybody does.</TE>

<LD>Twenty-six years as a high school basketball coach has taught Richard
Masson something about when to use a timeout. He used two timeouts in
the opening two minutes of the third quarter Friday night, determined
to get the attention of his Carson High players.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw momentum slipping," he said. "I didn't like our intensity."</LD>
<LD>   Masson's intervention made all the difference, because the Colts
refused to squander a 12-point halftime lead and came away with a
57-48 victory over Woodland Hills Taft in a first-round game of the
City Championship basketball playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Samuel Hill scored 15 points, Ekene Ibekwe had 13 points and 12
rebounds and Marques Washington added 10 points for the No. 8-seeded
Colts (18-7), who next play top-seeded Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   Taft (16-9), the West Valley League champion, could never get
closer than five points in the second half despite an energetic
performance from All-City guard Steve Smith, who scored 26 and had
eight rebounds and eight steals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was telling me he was this, he was that," Hill said.
"After playing him, I give him a nine out of 10. He kept his team in
the game."</TE>
<TE>   Carson made 10 of 12 free throws in the fourth quarter to maintain
its lead. There were more than 40 as both teams used trapping
defenses.</TE>

<TE>   Fairfax 95, Locke 67--Evans Burns had 30 points and seven rebounds
and Jahsha Bluntt had 16 points and nine rebounds for second-seeded
Fairfax (27-3). Jamal Boykin and Kevin Bell scored 10 points each for
Fairfax. Kevin Lewis had 29 for Locke.</TE>
<TE>   In girls' City Championship playoff games:</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth 48, Crenshaw 45--The third-seeded Chancellors blew
almost all of an eight-point fourth-quarter lead but held on to beat
the Cougars and advance to a second-round game against Sylmar, a
55-46 winner over Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw (18-7), Coliseum League champion, made four of 15 free
throws, and in the third quarter when its defense held Chatsworth to
four points, Crenshaw made three of 18 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth (20-7), the West Valley champion, made 16 of 24 free
throws. Linnae Barber led the Chancellors with 13 points and 14
rebounds. Summer Johnson added 12, and two free throws with 1:19

<HD>One Big Problem With Mavs in Town</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Beaten soundly by the San Antonio Spurs in the first of a three-game
homestand, the Clippers now get an even higher-ranking team in the
West, the Dallas Mavericks tonight at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Mavs have run up big numbers on the Clippers in recent
seasons, sweeping them, 4-0, in 2000-2001 while averaging 102 points,
then getting 133 in this season's first meeting here, while making 11
of 21 three-point attempts.</LD>
<LD>   However, in an upset, the Clippers then went to Dallas three days
later and beat the Mavs, 117-100.</LD>
<TE>   The problem matchup for the Clippers is 7-footer Dirk Nowitzki,
who handles the ball like a little man, goes all over and makes
threes. The ideal Clipper to defend him would be 6-11 Lamar Odom, who
is just as mobile but now has his right wrist and right ankle in soft
casts and is out 2-4 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "When we beat Minnesota, Lamar guarded [6-11] Kevin Garnett,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said Friday. "I don't like to use it as a crutch
but the bottom line is, we lose one of the most versatile players in
the NBA when Lamar's not there. But there's a lot of teams missing
good players."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's sellout crowd for the Spurs' game was the Clippers'
12th of the season, breaking last season's franchise record. This
game is also expected to sell out.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Winn, the fan who hit a half-court shot at halftime of the
Clippers' game against Cleveland on Jan. 18, was awarded his prize
Thursday night, a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Mavs are coming out of the All-Star break on a

hotter now, having averaged 106 in January and 112 this month.</TE>

<HD>Pressley Is King of Daytona Trucks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Craftsman Trucks are the fastest things running at Daytona
International Speedway this week. They're also the most competitive,
and from the looks of Friday's Florida Dodge Dealers 250, the most
entertaining.</LD>
<LD>   In a finish that must have brought smiles to their race sponsor,
veteran Winston Cup driver Robert Pressley won after leading a parade
of four Dodge trucks that shuffled Rick Carelli out of the lead on
the next to last lap.</LD>
<LD>   Pressley, 43, making his first career start in a truck race after
more than 20 seasons in Winston Cup and Busch series stock cars, was
driving the same Dodge truck that won last year's Daytona race with
Joe Ruttman driving.</LD>
<TE>   "We never thought we could win Daytona with a new team and
everything," Pressley said. "We were just looking to hang around
until we got adjusted and make a run in the second half of the
season. But Bobby Hamilton gave me a stout truck and I can't thank
him enough."</TE>
<TE>   Ruttman, 57, who was dropped by the Hamilton Racing team despite
finishing third in the series last year, took fourth in a Dodge owned
by R.D. Smith, but he has no plans for the remainder of the season.
Pole-sitter Ted Musgrave was second and Brian Rose, Pressley's
teammate, was third.</TE>
<TE>   Carelli, in a Chevrolet, was the leader on a restart with two laps
remaining, but before the trucks hit the backstretch, Rose helped
push Pressley in front. For the remaining lap and a half, there were
no lead changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't have done it by ourselves," Pressley said. "I could
have gotten beside [Carelli,] but I couldn't have done anything with
him."</TE>
<TE>   Pressley, winless in 204 Winston Cup races, will start Sunday's
Daytona 500 in the 16th row, alongside Hamilton, his truck owner.</TE>
<TE>   The trucks, which had been running in the 195-mph range during
practice, had their speed trimmed a bit Friday by a late rules
modification, but they remained faster than the Winston Cup or Busch
cars.</TE>
<TE>   There were 26 lead changes among 12 drivers with Pressley leading
50 of the 100 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Busch series cars race today in the EAS/GNC Live Well 300. Joe
Nemechek will start on the pole, but most of the interest will center
around Dale Earnhardt Jr., who will be driving the No. 3 Chevrolet,
the first time his father's number has been used in a race since the
elder Earnhardt died here a year ago.</TE>

<BD>Shav Glick</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>America's most versatile driver showed again Friday how he can win
driving anything with four wheels.</LD>
<LD>   It's only February, but already this year Tony Stewart has won in
a Winston Cup stock car, a midget, a sprint car, and Friday, in an
International Race of Champions' Pontiac Firebird.</LD>
<LD>   It was Stewart's second win at Daytona International Raceway this
week, having won the Budweiser Shootout in Joe Gibbs' Pontiac last
Sunday. He also finished second to Michael Waltrip in a Twin 125
qualifying race Thursday for Sunday's Daytona 500, in which he will
start sixth.</LD>
<TE>   In Friday's 40-lap IROC, Stewart followed Al Unser Jr. for 17 laps
before making his move to the front with two laps remaining. He was
helped by a drafting push from Indy Racing League champion Sam
Hornish Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Unser, unemployed at the time except for his IROC ride, displayed
his old talents by holding the lead for 23 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Said Stewart: "It was fun today; it's always fun when you know
you're racing with 11 other cars that are just as even as yours and
it's up to you to do your job behind the steering wheel."</TE>
<TE>   In a race usually dominated by NASCAR drivers, the open-wheel
drivers from the IRL, Hornish and Scott Sharp, finished second and
third. After giving up the lead to hold off Stewart, Unser slipped to
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The second IROC will be at California Speedway on April 27.</TE>

<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>As if Darren Dreifort hasn't endured enough the last eight months,
laboring through the rehabilitation from his second elbow
reconstruction surgery in six years, he suited up for his first
spring-training workout Friday and discovered the name on the back of
his Dodger jersey was spelled wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "That's OK," Dreifort--or, according to his uniform,
Driefort--sighed. "I'm a medical redshirt, anyway."</LD>
<LD>   Dreifort is something of a medical marvel. After the pitcher tore
the medial collateral ligament in his right elbow June 29, Dr. Frank
Jobe, Dodger team physician, and Dr. Ralph Gambardella performed
Tommy John surgery, reaching the ligament through the same holes Jobe
had drilled through Dreifort's elbow in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   The right-hander, in the second year of a five-year, $55.4-million
contract, will not return until the All-Star break at the earliest,
but the Dodgers and Dreifort are pleased with his progress.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, who sat out the 1995 season because of his first elbow
surgery, has been able to play catch, throwing softly from a distance
of 80 feet, for several weeks. He will gradually increase his
workload during camp but is months away from throwing off a mound.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is right on schedule right now, it's just going to
take time," Dreifort said. "How much time, nobody knows. I think I
recovered from surgery a little quicker this time, and I might be a
little stronger now, but until I get on a mound, it's hard to tell
the difference [between this recovery and the one in 1995]."</TE>
<TE>   Once Dreifort gets back on the mound, the Dodgers probably will
try to convince him to adjust his mechanics. Some believe Dreifort's
awkward delivery may have been responsible for his arm troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll worry about that down the road," Dreifort said. "Right now I
just want to play catch and try not to develop any bad habits."</TE>
<TE>   Would it be possible for Dreifort, 29, to alter his motion?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "Everyone has his own arm slot, his own
way of doing things. You can tweak things, but to overhaul something
you've done for 20 years would be difficult."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kim Ng, Dodger assistant general manager, has begun conversations
with the agents for catcher Paul Lo Duca and reliever Matt Herges in
hopes of signing the players to multiyear contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca had a breakout season in 2001, batting a team-high .320
with 25 home runs, 90 runs batted in and 28 doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Herges was the Dodgers' primary set-up man, going 9-8 with a 3.44
earned-run average in 75 appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Talks are expected to center on three-year deals, but the Herges
negotiations could be slowed by the uncertainty surrounding his role.
If Herges is the team's closer this season, his agent would seek a
more lucrative deal; if he is a set-up man again, Herges would not
command as big a contract.</TE>

<TE>   Seven players--Japanese pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, Dominican pitchers
Odalis Perez, Rafael Roque, Danny Mota and Ricardo Rodriguez and
catchers Angelo Encarnacion and Jose Diaz--were not in camp Friday
because of delays in obtaining U.S. work visas. Venezuelan reliever
Giovanni Carrara was excused because of a family emergency and is
expected in camp Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii is expected in camp Tuesday, Roque and Mota arrived Friday
night, and Perez and Rodriguez are expected Sunday. Conflicting birth
certificates also revealed Encarnacion, who will catch at triple-A
Las Vegas, to be 33 years old, not 29.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for a mature catcher to handle our young staff
[in Las Vegas]," Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said, "so he'll fit
in fine."</TE>
<TE>   Shigeki Sano, who is 41-31 with 27 saves in 351 games in the
Japanese major leagues, agreed to a minor league contract with the
Dodgers and will report to minor league camp by March 1.</TE>

<LD>Pressure?</LD>
<LD>   Your coach questions your motivation.</LD>
<LD>   You are zero for nine from the floor over a three-game span.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-four feet from the basket, with the game on the line, you
take a pass from Kobe Bryant and find yourself with an open shot.</TE>
<TE>   Swish.</TE>
<TE>   No pressure for Devean George. Without hesitation, he made the
three-point shot Thursday night in Seattle that broke an 85-85
deadlock and gave the Lakers a lead they would not relinquish en
route to a 92-87 win.</TE>
<TE>   George, averaging 7.0 points in his third season with the Lakers
after arriving as a first-round draft choice out of Augsburg College
in Minneapolis, scored eight in the crucial fourth quarter Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done everything I could to get him motivated," said Laker
Coach Phil Jackson of George. "Maybe the problem was that he felt he
didn't play enough. Players come up with all sorts of justifications
when they are struggling."</TE>
<TE>   That will no longer be an excuse. Jackson started George on Friday
night against the Atlanta Hawks, only his second Laker start. He had
12 points.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what has changed, George responded with a shrug of the
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "I just went out and played," he said. "Even if I'm flat
offensively, even when I'm not shooting the ball well, I will
rebound, play defense and supply energy."</TE>
<TE>   And when his big moment came Thursday night against the Sonics,
there was no doubt how he would react.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask any of the guys," George said. "If I'm open, I'm I going to
shoot it. I like to score. I'm not going to pass up open shots."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Public-address announcer Lawrence Tanter is writing an apology to
Jackson for making a mistake in introducing the starting Laker lineup
for Tuesday night's game against the Washington Wizards, the first
such mistake Tanter has made in 19 years behind the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   Tanter introduced Derek Fisher as a starting guard when it should
have been Lindsey Hunter. "I could have gone to the scorer's table,"
Jackson said, "but it's not a big deal who starts."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Provides Big Payoff Again</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan was his old self against Phoenix--unflappable and
deadly with the game on the line.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who turns 39 on Sunday, scored with two-tenths of a second
left to give the Washington Wizards a 97-96 win over the Suns on
Friday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   After completing a 22-point performance with the winning
16-footer, Jordan pumped his fist, turned to a personal cheering
section behind the Suns' bench and said, "That's what they pay me
for."</LD>
<TE>   He said the thrill of making a clutch shot was even greater at his
age.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more so, because everybody knows who's going to take the
shot, and to come through when everybody needs you to come through, I
think that's a great lesson for our young kids that you should always
be positive," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Suns' Stephon Marbury made one of two free throws with
5.6 seconds to go, the Wizards called a timeout. Jordan took the ball
and worked his way from midcourt almost lazily, as if oblivious to
the clock, pumped once and went over Shawn Marion for the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hamilton had 29 points for Washington, which stopped a
two-game losing streak, and Tyrone Nesby had a season-high 18 points
and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Marbury, who earlier in the day pleaded innocent to driving under
the influence, scored 30 points. Marbury was arrested Feb. 8 and
booked on charges of extreme driving under the influence, driving
under the influence and speeding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 99, Minnesota 98--Raef LaFrentz scored 30 points, including
a driving layup with three seconds to play to lead the Nuggets at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Voshon Lenard drove down the right side of the lane and passed
across to the driving LaFrentz, who scored easily. Kevin Garnett's
last-gasp turnaround jumper missed the rim. *</TE>
<TE>   Utah 94, Toronto 85--Karl Malone and John Stockton each scored 23
points at Toronto as the Jazz won its third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Malone, ejected after receiving a second technical foul with less
than 42 seconds remaining, scored seven points during a 16-5 run for
the Jazz, which is 3-2 on its nine-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 116, Indiana 106--Baron Davis tied a career-high with 38
points and P.J. Brown had 18 rebounds as the Hornets won at
Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Brown surpassed 5,000 career rebounds and also recorded his
1,000th career assist as the Hornets won for the fifth time in seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 106, Chicago 81--Reserve Aaron Williams scored a
season-high 23 points, and Jason Kidd and Kerry Kittles each had 16
to lead the Nets at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Jefferson had 15 points for the Nets, who ended their
season-high three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 90, Milwaukee 88--Eddie Jones made a jumper with 7.1 seconds
left in overtime to lift the Heat at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson had a chance to tie it for the Bucks, but his
jumper from short range hit the rim as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Bucks' third consecutive loss to a non-contending team
in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 101, New York 90--Ben Wallace had season highs of 19
points and 22 rebounds as the Pistons came back from an early
17-point deficit at New York.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 107, Portland 104--Paul Pierce scored 31 points, including
six in a row in 17 seconds late in the game as the Celtics won at
Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 108, Golden State 99--Tim Duncan scored 10 of his 36
points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs came back from a 12-point
deficit at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah guard DeShawn Stevenson was suspended without pay for three
games by the league after pleading no contest to having sex with a
minor.</TE>
<TE>   His suspension began with Friday's game between the Jazz and the
Toronto Raptors.</TE>

<LD>Chris DiMarco was standing over a four-foot putt when he heard it,
that familiar ring of a cellular phone. He stepped away from the
putt, shot an annoyed look toward the gallery, then lined up again
and made it. After retrieving his ball from the cup, he said, "Turn
the phone off."</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, on the 16th green at TPC of Scottsdale, DiMarco
was about to putt a three-footer for birdie when someone in the crowd
stage-whispered "Noonan!" a la Caddyshack. DiMarco--who wound up
winning the tournament--made the putt, then motioned for the heckler
to be ejected, which he was.</LD>

<TE>   Jeff Maggert was disqualified after playing nine holes. Maggert
bent his putter in disgust and continued to play with it. Maggert

Thursday, was two over on his nine holes Friday.</TE>

<TE>   Where does David Duval keep his British Open trophy? Not under
lock and key, but on the counter of the golf shop at his home course,
Pablo Creek, in the Jacksonville, Fla., area.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to let everybody see it," said Duval. "I guess
they've taken about a thousand pictures of people with it. I
certainly wasn't going to carry it with me, so I felt I'd leave it at
home so people can enjoy the trophy."</TE>
<TE>   The scorecard of the 59 Duval shot to win the Bob Hope in 1999 is

<TE>   That distinguished gentleman carrying a golf club and walking just
outside the ropes with the Sergio Garcia group is his father and
coach, Victor Garcia. He carries the club as both a cane--he has
problems with a bum left foot--and as something to swing during the
slower moments, presumably when his son is performing his umpteenth
waggle over the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that I know how to handle myself on a golf course and I
know what to do," Sergio said. "So, more than anything, he just tries
to give me some confidence and keep me up. Like, 'Come on! Let's make
a couple birdies!' Sometimes it's nice, when something's not going
right and I see him there encouraging me."</TE>

<HD>For Gonzaga, It's Revenge</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Bulldogs have been waiting for rematch
with Pepperdine since an 88-79 loss at Malibu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPOKANE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>The framed team photos in the Gonzaga locker room came down after
Pepperdine beat the Bulldogs last month in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   They're leaning face-against-the-wall in Gonzaga Coach Mark Few's
office--two NCAA Sweet 16 teams and the 1999 Elite Eight team.</LD>
<LD>   This is what Pepperdine wrought with its 88-79 victory.</LD>
<TE>   This is what it feels like to be No. 8 in the nation--but No. 2 in
the West Coast Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes an anticipated rematch tonight that could all but assure
an NCAA tournament berth for Pepperdine, no matter what the outcome
of next month's WCC tournament in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga (23-3, 10-1 in the WCC) is already a shoo-in, and
Pepperdine (18-6, 11-0) has built a solid resume along with the
nation's longest winning streak at 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Win tonight in Gonzaga's raucous 4,000-seat gym--where the
Bulldogs are 127-9 in the last 10 years--and the Waves can rest easy
with a record that would include victories against UCLA and USC and a
sweep of Gonzaga.</TE>
<TE>   If Pepperdine loses--and doesn't manage to win the WCC tournament
either--the Waves will have to endure some uncertainty as they wait
almost a week for Selection Sunday after the WCC final March4.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal is more used to scanning the NBA
standings for postseason possibilities than worrying about the flaws
of the RPI system, but he doesn't see why the Waves should be on any
bubble despite an RPI rating that hovers in the 50s.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they decided today, we'd be in. We'd clearly be in,"
Westphal said. "[But] we have to finish strong.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody's going to lose. I really don't think a loss in a game
like this hurts any good team. I don't look at this game as an NCAA
do-or-die type for us. We want to keep our winning streak going and
win our league."</TE>
<TE>   A second "upset" of the Bulldogs figures to earn Pepperdine more
than just a regular-season title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would probably put us in the top 25," Westphal said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a loss, Pepperdine is in fairly good position for an
NCAA tournament berth.</TE>
<TE>   With six losses, the Waves' record isn't gaudy, but apart from
losses to UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine--teams that will have to win
the Big West tournament to go to the NCAA tournament--Pepperdine's
setbacks came against NCAA-bound teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves' other losses are to Utah, Oregon, Georgia and Arizona,
and all but the Georgia game were on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Few, a coach with little patience for the automatic status
seemingly granted teams from power conferences, can't believe there's
any debate about Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't even have to make a case for them," Few said. "The
thing I'm constantly amazed by is, OK, Pepperdine beats UCLA and
USC--basically on their home court--and nobody's talking about them
being on the bubble.</TE>
<TE>   "If you flip-flopped USC and UCLA, there's no way they'd be
undefeated in our league."</TE>
<TE>   As for missteps against lesser teams, Few again brings up UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "Pick one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal and Few are in solidarity hoping for two bids for the
WCC.</TE>
<TE>   But they'll be on opposite benches in the battle for the
regular-season title tonight--a game so anticipated at Gonzaga that
students have pitched a tent as they await the game, and even some
faculty and staff took a half-day off Monday to wait in line for
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Westphal greeted the campers as Pepperdine arrived for practice
Friday night, even inviting the students into the gym to watch. His
friendly offer--which might have won the Waves a little support
tonight in the crowd--was thwarted by building supervisors, who said
it was against school rules and sent the students back outside.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine won the first game by beating Gonzaga at one of its
strengths--rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Dan Dickau is the nation's image of Gonzaga, but the inside
trio of Cory Violette, Zach Gourde and Ronny Turiaf doesn't get
enough credit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Waves outrebounded Gonzaga by 14 in the first game and
had 24 offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   No small part of the credit for Pepperdine's strength on the
boards goes to Glen McGowan, who was suspended for the fall semester
for instigating a fight with a teammate in the school library.</TE>
<TE>   Since he joined the team in January, Pepperdine hasn't lost.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget Pepperdine added Glen McGowan," Few said. "He makes
them more physical. He killed us."</TE>
<TE>   And when Gonzaga got home, Few took a page from the playbook of
Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and redecorated the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "We covered up all our things painted on the wall," he said. "We
put up a nappy piece of cardboard and listed the opponent every week
with a pin on it. It's not very aesthetically pleasing, but ...</TE>
<TE>   "After we lost to Pepperdine we had to sit down and say,
'Everybody might be slapping you on the back about the rankings and
want to talk to you about the tournament everywhere you go. But we've
got to take each step one at a time. We're in conference.'"</TE>

<LD>The Newport-Mesa Unified School District released findings Friday
from an investigation into the death of Costa Mesa High football
player Matt Colby in September and found no wrongdoing by the
coaching staff, medical personnel or administrators.</LD>
<LD>   According to the report, the investigation was left incomplete
after Colby's mother, Kelli Colby, refused to be interviewed and
denied authorization to release Colby's medical history or allow an
interview with Dr. Nazli Ahmed, a family physician who examined Colby
three days before he collapsed on the sideline during a game against
Huntington Beach Ocean View High. He never regained consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   The autopsy report, released in December, said the outside
linebacker died from bleeding and swelling in the brain, likely after
suffering repeated blows to the head during two previous football
games.</LD>

<HD>Rowland Eliminates Edison With 54-44 Victory</HD>

<LD>Rowland High players declined Coach Gordon Hamlow's offer to wear
their new Sierra League championship T-shirts to school Friday,
opting instead to wear the Raider shirts they had worn all season.
The point was to stick with what had worked for a team coming off its
first league title in four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Rowland then followed through on the gesture Friday evening,
pulling out a 54-44 victory over Huntington Beach Edison in the first
round of the Southern Section Division I-A boys' basketball playoffs
at Rowland Heights.</LD>
<LD>   After Edison erased an 11-point, third-quarter deficit to take a
44-43 lead with about three minutes to play on Jon Nehrig's 15-foot
jumper as the shot clock expired, the Raiders rattled off the final
11 points to secure victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I was especially pleased with the way our kids kept their
composure," said Hamlow, who has built a winner in his first season.
"They didn't get rattled."</TE>
<TE>   Rowland (20-7) will play third-seeded Thousand Oaks (24-3), a
64-48 winner over Santa Ana Century, in the second round Tuesday at a
site to be determined by a coin flip.</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Vashon Pruitt had 19 points and Marques Smith added
13 for the Raiders, who pulled away as three Edison starters fouled
out in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt tied the game at 44 on a free throw with 2:42 to go, then
gave Rowland the lead for good on a putback of his own miss. Edison's
Eric Prendergast could have pulled the Chargers (17-11) back to
within a point with about a minute to go, but his three-pointer
rattled out of the rim and the Raiders went on to secure the victory
by making six of 10 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Braun, who led Edison with 12 points, and Nehrig, who added
11, both fouled out. The Chargers also played without 6-foot-6 center
Tommy Grady, , who was nursing an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Rowland has not advanced to the second round since the 1996-97
season. "We're going to take this thing as far as we can," Pruitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Gorgonio 66, Corona Santiago 63--Khorry Lewis hit a
three-pointer to give San Gorgonio (20-7) a one-point lead with a
minute to play and Kevin Houston made two free throws with four
seconds left in the Division I-A first-round game. Lewis, Houston and
Daryl Leach had 18 points each.</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley 76, Ontario 53--Matt Sweany led all scorers with
21 points for Capistrano Valley (22-6) in a Division I-AA first-round
game. Pete Decasas scored 17 points and Jake Franzen had 15 points
for the Cougars. Ontario (15-10) got a 20-point performance from
Marcel Mack.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge 49, La Palma Kennedy 48--Patrick Haddan scored 11 of
his team-high 18 points in the first quarter and made a crucial steal
with 12 seconds to play that helped host Woodbridge defeat La Palma
Kennedy in a Division II-AA first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore center David Burgess added 15 points, and scored
Woodbridge's only two baskets during a 17-4 Kennedy run that brought
the Fighting Irish back from a 14-point fourth quarter deficit.
Kennedy (16-11), had a chance to win the game, but Rhema McKnight's
22-footer at the buzzer bounded off the front of the rim.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Dermody</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 80, Hemet 56--Harrison Scahen had 19 points
and 11 rebounds for top-seeded Mater Dei (23-4), which outscored
Hemet in the second and third quarters, 45-19, in the Division II-AA
first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco 86, West Valley 62--Senior guard Giovanni St. Amant
tossed in 40 points and contributed 15 rebounds, five assists and
five steals for visiting St. John Bosco (22-6) in the Division II-AA
first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Ridgecrest Burroughs 64, La Canada 61--Gavin MacGregor had 22
points and 17 rebounds and Karl Williams had 14 second-half points
and seven assists to help visiting Burroughs (14-9) upset
third-seeded La Canada (22-5) in a Division III-A first-round game.</TE>

<HD>Shots Don't Fall for Bozeman, Thompson</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The evidence is indisputable by now. Although freshman guards Cedric
Bozeman and Dijon Thompson are rangy, athletic and full of potential,
they share a significant flaw.</LD>
<LD>   They can't shoot.</LD>
<LD>   Both racked up points in high school because they dominated
shorter, slower opponents by taking the ball to the basket. At UCLA,
they've displayed the ability to create shots by penetrating, but
don't do so with regularity.</LD>
<TE>   That leaves jump shots, and, put simply, they don't fall.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman missed all four attempts from the field against Arizona,
dropping his shooting percentage to 38.1%. He is four for 19 in the
last five games.</TE>
<TE>   He is especially inaccurate from three-point range and the
free-throw line, staples for a point guard, making only four of 17
(23.5%) from each place.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson made a dunk and missed an open three-point shot against
Arizona. He has not made more than two field goals in a game since
his best outing, a 14-point effort against UC Irvine in December.</TE>
<TE>   He is 36 for 94 (38.3%) from the field, including eight of 33 from
three-point range (24.2%). Thompson has missed seven three-point
attempts in a row.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Sun Devils' 22-point loss to USC on Thursday dropped
them to 1-7 on the road. However, Arizona State, the only Pacific 10
Conference team to defeat Arizona and Oregon, can be dangerous.
Center Chad Prewitt has averaged 20.4 points and 7.4 rebounds the
last 14 games. The Sun Devils will be without versatile senior
forward Awvee Storey and guard Kenny Crandall, who is shooting 47.4%
from three-point range in Pac-10 games. Both are injured. UCLA
outrebounded Arizona State, 50-35, in the Bruins' 82-79 victory at
Tempe. The Sun Devils have not won at Pauley Pavilion since 1987.</TE>

<TE>   Biggest Question of Spring</TE>
<TE>   After seasons ruined by injuries and ineffectiveness last year,
can Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon recover health and productivity at
the plate this spring? If not, given the lack of offensive depth, the
Angels can raise the white flag on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Job Seekers</TE>
<TE>   The roster is remarkably set, particularly for a team that
finished 41 games out of first place last season. But youngsters Matt
Wise, John Lackey and Chris Bootcheck each hope to throw well enough
to establish himself as first choice to replace a starting pitcher in
case of injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keep Your Eyes On</TE>
<TE>   Minor league shortstops Alfredo Amezaga and Brian Specht. The
Angels are better off with David Eckstein at second base than
shortstop, and the sooner one of these minor league shortstops
appears ready for the majors, the sooner the team can decide between
Eckstein and Adam Kennedy at second. Amezaga was last year's phenom
and could be ready this summer; Specht could be this year's phenom
and might be ready next year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Be Excited</TE>
<TE>   The Angel pitching rotation--Jarrod Washburn, Sele, Appier, Ramon
Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis--presents a legitimate starter each time
out. All won at least 10 games last season, all but Washburn pitched
at least 200 innings, and all but Schoeneweis posted a winning
record. Closer Troy Percival saved 39 games last season and set a
club record for save percentage. Troy Glaus hit 89 home runs and
Garret Anderson drove in 240 runs over the past two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reasons to Be Worried</TE>
<TE>   The offensive margin for error is perilously close to zero, with
no significant help expected this year from the minor leagues.
Fullmer is expected to close the hole at DH, but Erstad and Salmon
must rebound to power an offense expected to generate below-average
production at first base, second base and shortstop. Seldom do first
basemen bat seventh, as Scott Spiezio and Shawn Wooten are likely to
do.</TE>

<LD>A man in Belgian custody has told U.S. authorities about business
ties between the Al Qaeda terrorist network and a Russian arms broker,
delivering a breakthrough in long-frustrated efforts to dismantle one of
the world's largest weapons-trafficking operations, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Belgian and American officials said Friday that Sanjivan Ruprah, a
Kenyan diamond mine owner, has offered details to U.S. investigators
about business dealings between Al Qaeda and the sprawling arms-trading
operation run by Victor Bout, a Russian broker accused of transporting
massive quantities of weapons to Africa and Afghanistan in violation of
U.N. arms embargoes.</LD>
<LD>   Officials familiar with Ruprah's case and his cooperation with U.S.
investigators said his knowledge of Bout's organization could provide
vital evidence in learning how terror groups are armed and how
international weapons networks operate.</LD>
<TE>   Lee S. Wolosky, a former National Security Council official who headed
a U.S. effort to stem Bout's trading, said Ruprah's arrest "is a very
significant development in dismantling the Victor Bout organization."
Wolosky described it as the "largest arms-trafficking organization in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   There were indications, some officials said Friday, that Belgian
authorities are on the verge of seeking a warrant for Bout's arrest. One
source familiar with the case said it could come "in a matter of days."</TE>
<TE>   Bout has never been charged for his role in clandestine arms trading.
International law does not target those who broker arms deals. And
governments long have had difficulty building strong cases against Bout,
who has used five passports and often moves assets and cargo planes from
country to country.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they are uncertain where Bout is now. Some have
suggested that he is in Russia; others say he lives in the United Arab
Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Three United Nations inquiry panels looking into the arming of rebel
factions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Angola have accused Bout of
transporting millions of dollars in assault rifles, missile launchers,
ammunition and even helicopter gunships. The three panels have a U.N.
Security Council mandate to investigate how arms brokers violated
sanctions against arms sales to the three war-torn nations.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. investigators have described Ruprah, a Kenyan national who has
lived in Belgium for the last year, as a key figure in the arms trade.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah, who has been cooperating with U.S. authorities for several
months, was taken into custody Feb. 8 by Belgian police investigating
money-laundering activities there among associates of Bout.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian Public Prosecutor Dirk Merckx, who has been overseeing a
three-year investigation into Bout's operation, declined to discuss the
details of Ruprah's case, citing a judicial order. But he said that
Ruprah's arrest showed how the main inquiry into Bout's activities is
gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a useful operation," Merckx said of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah was one of five people arrested after raids on 18 residences in
Brussels and several other cities. The others detained were two of
Ruprah's assistants and two Belgians who were allegedly part of Bout's
financial network. According to Johan Peleman, a Belgian expert on arms
trafficking, Belgian law enforcement interest in Ruprah stemmed from his
role in buying diamonds from mining concessions in Kenya, Liberia and
Congo. The Belgian city of Antwerp is an international center of the
diamond trade.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruprah also has vast knowledge about Bout's financial dealings,
Peleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Belgian investigators have spent the last three years focusing "on
money flows associated with Victor Bout through Belgium," Peleman said.
Belgian authorities, Peleman said, have examined "thousands of money
transfers" flowing from several Bulgarian-based firms and through several
African governments through "aviation and handling companies in Belgium
that are run by Bout."</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah is being held on charges of money laundering, conspiracy and
possession of false documents. The Belgian newspaper Le Soir quoted
British officials as saying Ruprah had been using a false British
passport.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Merckx nor American officials would comment on how the Belgian
case against Ruprah might affect his cooperation with U.S. authorities.
But Wolosky said he doubts that the U.S. effort would be compromised.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest, Wolosky said, "can only help if what he's saying is true."
Under pressure from the Belgians, he added, Ruprah might "provide more
information about the scope of Al Qaeda operations."</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. and Belgian interest in Bout's activities predated the
Sept. 11 attacks in America, evidence that his far-reaching arms trading
empire might have aided Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and
Afghanistan's now-deposed Taliban government appears to have heightened
both nations' investigative efforts.</TE>
<TE>   According to Peleman, Ruprah told U.S. law enforcement agents that
over the last two years, Bout made leasing arrangements with Al Qaeda
operatives to ship arms on Ariana Airways, the national airline of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported last month that Air Cess, one of Bout's air cargo
firms based in the Emirates airport of Sharjah, was hired by the Taliban
in 1996 to act as cargo handlers and suppliers for Ariana flights--work
that enabled the Taliban to have weapons and military supplies delivered
to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Peleman, who has investigated Bout for the United Nations, said that
Ruprah also told him that he had informed U.S. authorities about secret
business dealings linking Bout to the illicit diamond trade in Africa.
There have been reports in recent weeks that Bin Laden's group made
millions of dollars by funneling diamonds mined by rebels in Sierra
Leone.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official verified that Ruprah had provided information about
Bout's contacts with Bin Laden's network. The official said Ruprah has
mentioned Bout's activities in funneling arms to Africa and the Russian's
involvement in smuggling diamonds from African mines.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruprah's key role is in providing information to the U.S.
investigation "looking at potential links to Al Qaeda. That's the
direction this has worked in," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah has been flown several times from Belgium to Washington in
recent months for questioning by U.S. law enforcement agents, Peleman
said. Several current and former U.S. officials confirmed that Ruprah has
been talking with FBI agents in Brussels and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Peleman, who has been in contact regularly with Ruprah in recent
months, said the Kenyan national told him that he began cooperating with
U.S. and British authorities in late September "to get some leverage" and
avoid being drawn into the international terrorism investigations that
followed the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah has been described by U.N. investigators as a former air
transport firm owner who played a key role "in Liberia's airline
registry." Bout and other arms traders had often registered their
airplanes in Liberia to escape international scrutiny and regulation,
Peleman said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in 1999, a U.N. report concluded, Ruprah was authorized
by the Liberian government to act as a "global civil aviation agent
worldwide"--but on a later visit to Liberia, U.N. investigators were told
by government aviation officials there that they had never heard of
Ruprah.</TE>
<TE>   Bout and Ruprah located some business interests in Belgium for several
reasons, said Peleman and other officials familiar with Bout's operation.</TE>
<TE>   Both required proximity to Antwerp, a critical dispersal point for
diamonds that U.N. investigators say have been repeatedly used by African
rebel movements and dictatorships to pay for weapons shipped from former
Soviet bloc nations.</TE>
<TE>   Bout also had once based many of his battered old Soviet cargo planes
in the airport at Ostend, Belgium. But after his role in providing arms
to African hot spots became known, Bout was forced to move his operation
in 1997 after Belgian aviation authorities pressured him to leave,
according to U.N. investigators.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Bout found a new home for many of his planes in an airport in
Sharjah, from which U.S. officials and Afghan sources suspect that he is
providing arms to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The Emirates resisted efforts to dislodge Bout's fleet until last
year. But although officials there have since declared Bout unwelcome,
there are signs, Peleman and U.S. officials said, that some of his planes
are still based there.</TE>
<TE>   Ruprah, who is often seen wearing an old leather coat, had been
showing signs of nerves about the Belgian and U.S. inquiries before his
arrest, Peleman said. Calling from his suburban Brussels home, Ruprah
would often telephone from one mobile phone and direct Peleman to call
back on another.</TE>
<TE>   "He clearly knew he was under suspicion," Peleman said.</TE>

<HD>Skating's New Gold Standard</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Canadians and Russians will share first place. Judging
inquiry continues.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Bowing to public pressure and determined to curb a media-fueled
frenzy consuming the Winter Olympics, the International Olympic
Committee's executive board voted Friday to give pairs figure skating
gold medals to Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was made following a recommendation by the International
Skating Union, which indefinitely suspended French judge Marie Reine Le
Gougne on Friday. She said moments after the competition that she had
been pressured by the French figure skating federation to cast her vote a
certain way but said she resisted and voted according to her conscience.
She has since signed a statement for the ISU.</LD>
<LD>   The move marks the first time the IOC has reversed a judgment call to
award a gold medal, although it has occasionally overturned results based
on doping violations and technical errors.</LD>
<TE>   It may also be a harbinger of things to come for the IOC under the
administration of recently installed President Jacques Rogge. He appears
to work much faster than his predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, but the
dizzying pace of developments here this week also left a rash of
questions unanswered. In addition, Friday's action raised concerns about
future appeals of judge's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, asked NBC commentator and former Olympian Scott
Hamilton, could similar disputes arise involving competitors who simply
can't accept losing?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much a can of worms as it could open a can of sour
grapes," Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   But Olympic and skating officials were determined to put the best
possible face on their actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence is that she is responsible of misconduct that is more
than circumstantial, and she acted in a way that was not adequate to
guarantee both pairs equal condition," ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta
said during a news conference crowded with hundreds of reporters from
around the world. "And I think this is enough . . . . This was an
extraordinary deliberation of the ISU in the presence of an extraordinary
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC's Rogge agreed, saying: "I don't think this has created damage
to the Olympic movement, because it was resolved fast, in the best
possible way, taking into account the interests of the athletes and the
interest of sport. I am happy for the resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Sale, 24, and Pelletier, 27, said they were surprised at the uproar
that followed their runner-up finish. They said their emotions were mixed
Friday, in part because the controversy threatened to overshadow the rest
of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel not guilty but a little bit sad because athletes from around
the world aren't getting the attention they deserve," Pelletier said.
"We're happy justice was done."</TE>
<TE>   Leonid Tyagachev, president of the Russian Olympic Committee, said
through an interpreter that his organization will accept the Canadian
pair's new status in the spirit of sportsmanship: "We don't protest this
decision of the IOC. But we don't think it's [a] very good decision."</TE>
<TE>   According to ISU rules, Le Gougne was obligated to immediately tell
Cinquanta and the referee of the judging panel, Ronald Pfenning, of the
attempt to sway her vote before the competition.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said nothing until after she judged the event, in which
she voted with the 5-4 majority in ranking Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia ahead of the Canadians. That gave the Russians the
gold and consigned Sale and Pelletier to silver-medal status.</TE>
<TE>   Pfenning, an American, believed the outcome was unjust and said so in
the customary judges' meeting after the event. He was stunned when Le
Gougne said she had been under duress, and he relayed his concerns about
Le Gougne's actions to Cinquanta in a letter Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta initially said his organization--which governs figure
skating, speed skating and synchronized skating--would not act until next
week. But with the integrity of its judges under fire and the Canadian
Olympic Assn. preparing to go before the Court of Arbitration for Sport
to argue Sale and Pelletier should be elevated to co-gold medalists, the
ISU met Friday morning and devised the duplicate-medal remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Filing the complaint was part of our strategy to put pressure on the
ISU to move on this," said Pierce Brunet, a lawyer for the Canadian
Olympic Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta said the ISU will continue its investigation into the
imbroglio and said he is working on a new set of judging standards to
help strip the sport of the subjective judging that can stem from
cultural bias.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating has dealt for many years with rumors of deal-making and
collusion by judges, although it has rarely been proved.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got enough evidence to take the first decision, that I've
pronounced," he said. "Now, please, give us some more time."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier stressed throughout the ordeal that they were not
pitted against their Russian counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take anything away from Anton and Elena," Pelletier said.
"This was not something against them."</TE>
<TE>   Sale thanked Canadian sports authorities for their support and added,
"I sure hope the inquiry keeps going and the truth comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Pending approval of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, Cinquanta
proposed awarding the new medals before the gold medalist in the women's
competition is crowned Thursday at the Salt Lake Ice Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can raise the flag. I'd like that for the entire Canadian
delegation," said Pelletier, who learned of the reversal Friday morning
in a call from the couple's attorney, Craig Fenech. "But I'm not
controlling this, and I know they're going to give it the best way for
everybody, and I will take whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Sale said she thought the controversy robbed her of a long-imagined
moment: performing perfectly, being rewarded with a gold medal and
ascending the medal stand to hear "O Canada" play while the crowd roars.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all every Olympian dreams of," she said emphatically. "It's
all I dreamed of my whole life, since I saw [fellow Canadian] Liz Manley
win her silver medal [at the 1988 Calgary Games]. I visualized my flag
being in the middle and hearing my anthem. I was prepared for it,
emotionally and physically. You bet you're cheated of that, big time."</TE>
<TE>   Sikharulidze said he did not feel cheated by the elevation of Sale and
Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is up to the ISU," he said. "We feel we won the event. We
deserve the gold medal. Maybe now, they deserve one too. We are just
athletes. We don't make these kind of decisions. We only skate. And we
did our best."</TE>
<TE>   But other Russians wondered if the ISU and IOC had been pressured to
act by the North American media's unabashed support of Sale and
Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   NBC helped start and sustain the controversy, with commentators
Hamilton and Sandra Bezic declaring the Canadians' romantic "Love Story"
routine indisputably superior to the Russians' elegant performance to
"Meditation" from the opera "Thais."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to award another set of gold medals was welcomed by
skating insiders.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's solving half the problem," said John Nicks, a two-time
British Olympian and 10-time Olympic coach who coaches women's singles
competitor Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel. "I was very pleased to hear it .
. . . But I think they solved the easy part of the problem. There hasn't
been enough disclosure to try and assess complete blame and culpability."</TE>
<TE>   He added he's not afraid of a similar controversy in the women's
competition: "I'm very confident the sort of transparency that has been
indicated by the media will mean everybody will be under a microscope."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, coach of men's bronze medalist Tim Goebel, also
applauded Friday's decision. "I think it's a very good thing. But I also
think they should keep investigating."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hamilton: "This is a set of extraordinary circumstances. The
French judge stepped forward and the IOC was able to act decisively . . .
. I feel badly that the skaters were dragged into this whole mess. The
ISU has got some serious issues to consider."</TE>
<TE>   Tyagachev, the head of the Russian Olympic Committee, said the
decision has caused some to wonder about results of past contests.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people thought Alexander Karelin won in Sydney [where he lost
the Greco-Roman wrestling gold medal to American Rulon Gardner], but we
did not protest this decision; we accepted it as part of sport. Some of
my advisors have come to me this morning and asked that we ask for a
review of the Karelin decision, but I say, 'No, judging is part of sport
and we accept the decision of the judges.' "</TE>
<TE>   Friday's events also gave U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra
Baldwin reason to hope the IOC will reconsider Roy Jones Jr.'s loss to a
South Korean opponent in a gold medal boxing match at the 1988 Seoul
Games. It was later revealed the judges had accepted money from boxing
officials from the host country.</TE>
<TE>   "Roy was an individual athlete, victimized by judgment that was
flawed," Baldwin said. "We now have a precedent that we didn't have
before."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of that outcome, one thing is certain after Friday's
decision: ISU judges will face closer scrutiny than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "The case is solved for us," Pelletier said. "The case is not solved
for skating."</TE>

<LD>The complaint lacked many details and was mostly strategy.</LD>
<LD>   But it worked like a charm.</LD>
<LD>   When Pierce Brunet, a lawyer for the Canadian Olympic Assn., filed his
paperwork Thursday afternoon with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, he
asked two things: First, that the judges involved in the controversial
decision that gave the Russian pairs figure skating duo the gold medal
over a Canadian team be ordered to stay here and be made available for
interviews. Then the kicker: The Canadian team must be given gold medals
too, based on evidence of impropriety in the judging.</LD>
<TE>   The complaint served as the final piece in a mosaic of political,
sporting and backstage intrigue. It was hand-delivered by Brunet himself,
reaching the court of arbitration about 3:40 p.m. Then things began to
move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Brunet figures the International Olympic Committee and the
International Skating Union knew about it "within minutes." At the men's
figure skating competition the same night, the buzz that the Canadians
were mounting a legal challenge spread like wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   Brunet also knew he could get results by working through the court, an
independent, international arbiter of sports issues: The CAS just
recently had reinstated a Latvian bobsledder that the IOC had tried to
ban following a positive steroid test.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, his document, with all that it lacked--like the who, what and
how of the alleged judging wrongdoing--is now part of Olympic history.
According to Brunet, the IOC and ISU were quickly notified that a
three-person arbitration panel was being formed, that the panel had
scheduled a hearing and, even though the hearing would be closed, there
was the likelihood of a news conference immediately afterward, about 2
p.m. MST Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Brunet knew if things went his way, there would be no need
for that news conference. And he was right.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, there was another news conference Friday, one announcing that
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier would receive gold medals in
addition to those received by the Russian duo of Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze.</TE>
<TE>   IOC sources insisted Friday that the Canadian complaint--and any legal
steps taken by the court of arbitration--"was no factor, wasn't even
discussed" in the decision to award double golds.</TE>
<TE>   A key to the resolution of the dispute, it appears, was that IOC
President Jacques Rogge and ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy had
been discussing the controversy continually. They had held three meetings
since Tuesday, the day after the pairs competition.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the IOC wrote a letter to the ISU, pressuring it to move
quickly on the matter. Rogge said Cinquanta "started an inquiry" Thursday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, Rogge and Cinquanta met again at the IOC's base
of operations here, the Little America hotel. Then they went to the men's
figure skating finals.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday night, after the skating, Cinquanta called a meeting of
his ISU executive committee. At that meeting, it was decided that the ISU
would ask the IOC to give a second set of gold medals to the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference Friday, Cinquanta said there was sufficient
evidence that the French judge, Marie Riene Le Gougne, had "acted in a
way that was not adequate to guarantee both pairs equal condition."</TE>
<TE>   And that apparently was the only evidence needed. What remains
unclear, several sources say, is who pressured the judge to vote a
certain way, how they did so, and why. Le Gougne has denied having
succumbed to the pressure, admitting in an affidavit to the ISU only that
she failed to report it to officials before the event.</TE>
<TE>   Once the ISU executive committee made the proposal to the IOC,
international sports protocol was nicely in order. The IOC could now act
on the ISU's action, rather than generating the action.</TE>
<TE>   The distinction is critical for Olympic politics and relations. It
meant that the decision-making power of international federations, and
the authority of the federations over sports results at the Olympic
Games, would remain intact.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was up to Rogge to respond officially, and to do that, he
called a meeting of his 15-member executive board for 9:30 a.m. Friday in
Ballroom C of the Little America.</TE>
<TE>   Because several of the IOC board members had left Salt Lake City,
there were only nine on hand to vote. Voting yes to the ISU's gold-medal
proposal were R. Kevan Gosper of Australia, Thomas Bach of Germany, Denis
Oswald of Switzerland, Gunilla Lindberg of Sweden, Marc Hodler of
Switzerland, Toni Khoury of Lebanon and Sergei Bubka, the former
world-class pole vaulter, of Ukraine. Voting no was He Zhenliang of
China. Abstaining was Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, China's He did not want the IOC to cave in just
because the media applied great pressure. The sources also said Smirnov
abstained, and they described this as a politically correct move because
the Russian skaters' victory was central to the dispute. Smirnov also
reportedly voiced during the meeting a fear that the Russians would
somehow be looked upon as the cause of the improper judging.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Smirnov declined to confirm or deny his abstention.
But he expressed a concern that the IOC is setting a precedent that might
be seized upon by others aggrieved by past Olympic results or those who
might contest results at future Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing against the decision about giving second medals," he
said. "But if we have such cases, they should be treated equally. If we
have such investigations, they should be investigated more precisely.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the problem. If you want to be fair, you have to be fair to
everybody. It doesn't matter whether they are Americans, Canadians,
Russians, whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Sources in the Olympic movement said that media pressure was an
issue--but not on the merits of the decision. Instead, it played a key
role in Rogge's move to expedite the case.</TE>
<TE>   Others said there was pressure to get the Games back on track.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone wanted to get the focus back on the athletes here,
rather than dragging this out," said a source who was familiar with the
sequence of events over the last few days.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's IOC meeting lasted 45 minutes, and once the vote was taken, a
news conference was hurriedly called for 11 a.m. Gosper, Rogge and
Cinquanta delivered the news and took questions.</TE>
<TE>   Brunet stood in the back of the room, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, Rogge called the decision "elegant and proper." He added,
"We did this for justice and fairness for the athletes. And it respects
the relations we have with the federations."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he said, "the media buzz always plays a role. But we were
not under pressure by the media."</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Dump in Nev. Gets Bush OK</HD>
<DH>Environment: The decision to bury waste at the Yucca Mountain site
enrages governor, who vows to fight the plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>President Bush approved Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the burial
ground for the nation's radioactive nuclear waste Friday, and an enraged
Gov. Kenny Guinn promptly sued to block the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   "I am outraged, as are the citizens of Nevada, that this decision
would go forward with so many unanswered questions," Guinn said. Nevada
has set aside $5.4 million and hired lawyers in San Francisco and
Washington to fight the decision in the courts.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Congress, Bush said that, based on the advice of Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham, Yucca Mountain is "qualified" to serve as a
repository, which he said "is important for our national security and our
energy future."</LD>
<TE>   The state immediately answered by filing a lawsuit in the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Washington, challenging Abraham's recommendation of
Yucca Mountain and Bush's acceptance of it, on the grounds that the site
doesn't meet Congress' criteria for a nuclear waste repository.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the real battle will begin," said John Ensign, Nevada's
Republican senator.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's other senator, Democratic Whip Harry Reid, said Bush "has
betrayed our trust and endangered the American public" by deciding to
ship 77,000 tons of nuclear waste cross country to the bulbous mountain
90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Reid noted that when Bush campaigned in Nevada in 2000, he promised to
make a decision based on science instead of politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, President Bush has broken his promise," Reid said Friday. "All
Americans should be concerned, not just because he lied to me or the
people of Nevada and indeed all Americans, but because the president's
decision threatens American lives."</TE>
<TE>   Guinn, a Republican, said he would formally oppose the development of
Yucca Mountain by exercising his "notice of disapproval."</TE>
<TE>   The governor has 60 days to reject the project, and he said Friday
that he was trying to determine the best timing. Once he vetoes the
president's decision, Congress has 90 working days to overrule him by
simple majority votes in both houses of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   By delaying his veto, Guinn said, Reid and Ensign will have more time
to lobby fellow senators to support Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Reid and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) have pledged to
block congressional support for Yucca Mountain but have conceded they are
unsure of their chances.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision was "premature and irresponsible," Daschle said
Friday. "This isn't a political issue; it's a public safety issue."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the nuclear waste dump--including Nevada's politicians,
environmentalists, scientists and anti-nuclear advocates--have long
braced themselves for Bush's announcement and renewed their vows Friday
to fight the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Their actions include lawsuits alleging that the Energy Department has
ignored its congressional mandate to find a geologically sound burial
ground and grass-roots campaigning in concert tours by Bonnie Raitt and
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.</TE>
<TE>   The battle line over Yucca Mountain will be drawn between the states
that will benefit from sending their nuclear waste to Nevada and those
states that don't want casks of radioactive material traveling along
their highways and railroad lines.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham has said the risks of transporting radioactive waste to Nevada
are outweighed by the dangers of leaving the material at 131 nuclear
power plants in 39 states around the nation--at sites within 75 miles of
towns and cities in which 161 million Americans live. Nuclear waste from
military installations also will be shipped to Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Based on preliminary planning, nuclear waste will travel through 42
states on its way to Nevada, frequently in amounts greater than what is
generated in some of those states' own nuclear plants.</TE>
<TE>   Even assuming the nuclear waste can be delivered here safely, Nevada
officials complain that Yucca Mountain offers no geological safeguards
against radioactive leakage.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department has conceded in recent years that the treeless
Yucca Mountain--a volcanic ridge that rises 1,300 feet above the desert
valley and is broken with 34 earthquake faults--is not sufficient by
itself to contain radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   The material will be stored in vaults buried in tunnels deep inside
the mountain, with the government's expectation they will remain safe for
10,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists are worried that water trickling through the mountain
will corrode the casks and that radiation will seep into the desert
aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said she was disappointed by Bush's
decision and was concerned that ground water contamination "may pose a
serious threat to the health and safety of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   The Government Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm,
concluded in December that nearly 300 scientific and engineering
questions remain unanswered and that the government's hope to open the
facility by 2010 is unrealistic. It said the government doesn't know how
long it will take to prepare Yucca Mountain and at what cost.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Congress approves Yucca Mountain this year, the repository
must be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, prompting further
scientific debate.</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Singer, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the
industry's lobbying organization, said he is confident Congress will
override Guinn's veto and endorse Yucca Mountain. "We don't think there
will be a serious problem getting a decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress in 1982 promised the nuclear power industry it would find a
place to store its radioactive waste by 1999. Since 1987, the only venue
under consideration has been Yucca Mountain, which straddles the Nevada
Test Site where 928 nuclear tests occurred between 1951 and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn said Nevada has learned its lessons in dealing with the federal
government over the years and is wary of its promises that Yucca Mountain
is safe.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1950s, we took the government at its word when they said
underground testing would be safe," Guinn said. "We said, fine, OK, we're
patriotic. Then they started above-ground testing and said, oh, it's
safe, you can go out on the hill and watch.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we found out they weren't right," Guinn said. "We're a much
bigger state today--the fastest growing in the nation--and we have an
obligation not only to ourselves but to our neighbors to fight this."</TE>
<TE>   The population of the Las Vegas Valley is about 1.4 million people
today, more than double what it was when Yucca Mountain was targeted as a
dump site 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The casino industry--the state's biggest business--is also opposed to
the use of Yucca Mountain, although it has not yet put much money into
the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "In all our conversations with members of Congress, we've argued that
alternatives need to be found," said Alan Feldman, spokesman for MGM
Mirage, the largest casino operator in Las Vegas. "But the problem is,
the pro-nuclear industry has spent so much money on this, we couldn't
dream spending that kind of money. What we might try to do now may be too
little, too late."</TE>
<TE>   He observed, however, that any kind of catastrophe at Yucca Mountain
would doom the state's economy. "Tourism in Chernobyl has been pretty bad
in recent years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government has spent more than $4 billion--and by some estimates,
as much as $7 billion--studying the site. Abraham recommended to Bush on
Thursday that the site be approved because it is "technically suitable"
and "the science behind this project is sound."</TE>
<TE>   The president wasted little time in throwing his support behind the
recommendation, saying that nuclear energy, the second-largest source of
U.S. electricity generation, "must remain a major component of our
national energy policy in the years to come."</TE>
<TE>   But sending its waste to the outskirts of Las Vegas, said Mayor Oscar
Goodman, will expose "millions of Americans in 43 states to potential
nuclear holocaust."</TE>
<TE>   "All it takes is one terrorist with a TOW missile obtained on the
black market to take out a truck carrying this deadly substance, and we
get Chernobyl in our backyard," Goodman said. "This is the stuff of our
worst nightmares."</TE>
<TE>   One of Nevada's lawsuits, filed last summer, challenges the
assumptions and adequacy of radiation leakage standards established by
the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Another lawsuit, filed in December, alleges that the Energy Department
violated the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 by ignoring the requirement
that a site's geology provide the primary containment of radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Both lawsuits are pending in federal appellate court in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada officials have tried to block Yucca Mountain on bureaucratic
grounds--by denying the Energy Department water rights at the site. The
department has sued, and that case is pending in a Las Vegas federal
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   More lawsuits are planned, including ones alleging that the federal
government has violated its own procedural laws by prematurely adopting
an environmental impact study of the site.</TE>
<TE>   "Our best efforts will be in court," Guinn said, "where we can go
before a judge who will look at the facts and not whether we're a small
state going against the federal government or the nuclear industry's
political machine."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a Republican or Democratic issue," Guinn said. "It's
Nevada going against 39 states that produce this material."</TE>

<HD>A Town's Long Road to Recovery</HD>
<DH>Just across from Manhattan, Manhasset has become a dot on the map
known for taking a disproportionate hit Sept. 11, losing nearly 50
residents in the towers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. MOEHRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANHASSET, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>The man walks into the bar, shakes hands with his friends, orders a
beer. He looks like every other man in the place, but he's different, and
everyone knows it. They try not to stare.</LD>
<LD>   Seven hours later, the man's friends are gone, but the man is still
standing in the same spot at the bar, drinking, talking. No one needs to
ask why. The whole town knows the man's son died in the World Trade
Center, along with nearly 50 other people who hailed from here. His son
boarded the 5:43 a.m., or the 6:34 or one of the other 42 Long Island
Railroad trains that run into Manhattan each day, and he never came back.</LD>
<LD>   For generations, this small town 17 miles east of Manhattan has
straddled two identities. Simple country village, enclave of vast wealth.
A cross between "Our Town" and Fat City. Even before F. Scott Fitzgerald
romanticized Manhasset and used it as the setting for much of "The Great
Gatsby," the town had a reputation as one of those lovely places where
the American dream rings true, and often comes true.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Manhasset has a different reputation. Like nearby Garden City and
Belle Harbor, Manhasset will always be known as one of those tiny dots on
the map that took a disproportionate hit Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the country, people may be moving forward, gingerly
trying to get back to normal. Here, where the loss was so focused, the
grief is fading more slowly. In this 350-year-old community, discovered
by Dutch cow farmers just before Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity,
residents find themselves, in Fitzgerald's words, "borne back ceaselessly
into the past."</TE>
<TE>   "Everything feels different," says Casey Ryan, an agent at Spruce
Realty, on Plandome Road, Manhasset's main street. He frowns, and watches
people going past his window. "Everybody in this town knows somebody who
was killed."</TE>
<TE>   Optimists among Manhasset's 18,376 residents like to say the gloom is
lifting. They talk with tight smiles about the resilience of residents,
the indomitable human spirit, the fresh start that comes with a new year.
But each day brings new evidence that things are not normal.</TE>
<TE>   The sadness ebbs for a time; then, like the tide in Manhasset Bay, it
returns.</TE>
<TE>   At a local church, the priests call that awful Tuesday in September
"our Good Friday." At a fancy women's boutique, a customer returns all
the expensive lingerie she bought Sept. 10 because she can't imagine ever
feeling frivolous and romantic again. At Manhasset High School, there is
talk of canceling the Senior Frolic, and the Tower Foundation is
canceling next month's live auction. At Shelter Rock Elementary School,
teachers call off a series of lessons on building self-esteem: The
lessons emphasize family ties, and four children in the fourth grade
alone lost their fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pall over Manhasset," says Lillian Orofino, owner of Olive
Duntley Florist. "People are just going through the motions."</TE>
<TE>   "People who were born here," says her husband, Ray, "who grew up here
. . ."</TE>
<TE>   He stops and wipes his eyes with a rough, stained hand.</TE>
<TE>   ". . . don't live here no more."</TE>
<TE>   The Orofinos' son worked in the World Trade Center. He should have
been at his desk the morning of the attacks. But after keeping his staff
of 28 computer technicians working late into the night Sept. 10, he gave
everyone--himself included--the next morning off.</TE>
<TE>   When the Orofinos first heard that the World Trade Center was in
flames, they didn't know their son was safe, sleeping late. They locked
up their shop and dashed to his house.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after their relief wore off, dread set in. They began to hear
names, an endless roll call of names. People who weren't so lucky. People
who hadn't yet stepped safely off one of the trains pulling into
Manhasset's station like troop trains limping back from battle.</TE>
<TE>   Burke. Cosgrove. Coughlin.</TE>
<TE>   Customers. Neighbors. Friends.</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush. Robson. Seaman.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead were men the Orofinos knew as boys and watched grow.
Their big round faces were as welcome in the shop as new daisies. They
may have come to the Orofinos to buy orchids for their mothers, corsages
for their prom dates, roses for their wives. Now, the Orofinos were
making floral arrangements for their funerals.</TE>
<TE>   In those warm days of late September, there was a sickening false
spring in Manhasset as the town bloomed overnight with condolence
bouquets.</TE>
<TE>   Along with every other business in town, the Orofinos' flower shop
sits on Plandome Road, the only commercial strip. Like a cardboard set
for a play about small-town America, Plandome Road is the backdrop and
foreground of life in Manhasset.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, the road runs down a
gentle hill, past the bars where the men hang out, past the hair salons
where the women hang out, past the soda fountains where the teens hang
out, all the way to the yacht clubs, where the rich float out on Long
Island Sound.</TE>
<TE>   You can always read the mood of the town on Plandome Road, residents
say. Especially now, with the stores empty, the bars and churches packed.
At Leo's, where the bartenders honor the missing regulars by wearing
neckties adorned with U.S. flags, a New York Police Department officer
talks about the staggering number of hours he's logged at the World Trade
Center site and the things he's seen.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I'd seen it all," he says--then closes his eyes and slowly
shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Mary's, where roughly 40 members are gone, Father Peter
Dugandzic says flatly: "We will measure our lives from that point,"
meaning Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Plandome Road is the route of nearly every funeral, and every Memorial
Day parade, the town's grandest event. "The parade takes two hours," says
Patricia Roberts, the local parks commissioner. "And no one leaves until
it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Plandome Road is where residents come for an egg sandwich at Manhasset
Deli, a scotch and soda at Dunhill's, a slice of pizza at Gino's, a
fishing license at Town Hall. Plandome Road is the site of the
old-fashioned bandstand, where summer concerts are performed and where
the town gathered in September for a wrenching candlelight vigil.</TE>
<TE>   May Newburger, supervisor for the town of North Hempstead, of which
Manhasset is part, looks out the window of her Plandome Road office and
predicts things will be normal again one day. But she wonders if normal
is the right goal.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks, she says, people have been more tender with one
another, and the town has felt more intimate. She worries that people
will forget the lessons learned in tragedy. She thinks often of Emily,
the heroine in "Our Town," who regrets in her grave that she didn't spend
more time looking at her fellow human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we're doing now," Newburger says. "We're really looking
at each other."</TE>
<TE>   Of all places on Plandome Road, the train station is the town's
clacking heart. Late nights, when Plandome Road is empty, the traffic
lights pulsing yellow in both directions, the train to Manhattan can be
heard everywhere in town, the steady click of its wheels echoing from the
frozen Manhasset Bay to the oval skating pond.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Camaj, 23, can hear the train when he goes to Edison's
Alehouse for a drink with friends. He tries to ease the grief over his
father, Roko, who washed windows at the World Trade Center for more than
25 years. At closing time, he gives up, goes home, past the train
station, past Town Hall, past St. Mary's, to the house his father bought
on a window washer's salary.</TE>
<TE>   Some nights, Camaj finds his mother weeping softly in her room, trying
not to wake the rest of the family with her sobs. One night not long ago,
Camaj fell into a fitful sleep and saw his father.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK?" his father asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Vincent said. "I'm OK."</TE>
<TE>   "Good," his father said. "Because if you're OK, then I'm OK."</TE>
<TE>   "I talk to him all the time," Camaj says in a back booth at Edison's,
stirring his Long Island iced tea. "Dad, what do you want me to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Camaj's father always rose at 4:30 a.m. and caught one of the earliest
trains, often reaching the city in time to see the sun rise from the roof
of the World Trade Center. Among Manhasset commuters, he was the
exception: Most hold down high-paying jobs in the financial industry.
During the morning rush, they parade single file up Plandome Road, a
pinstriped platoon.</TE>
<TE>   As the portal to Manhattan, the train station has become a natural
focal point for the town's grief. Some weeks ago, the parents of a young
man who disappeared in the World Trade Center put up a flier in the
station waiting room. They were anxious to find a baseball cap their son
lost at the station last summer. The hat--with his scent, his sweat, his
hair--was at least something of their son they could retrieve.</TE>
<TE>   Many say the train station would be the logical site for a monument
now being planned by Manhasset officials. Others say the train station
became a monument Sept. 11, its parking lot filled with cars whose owners
would never return.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 73 unclaimed cars in the lot that day," says Roberts, the
parks commissioner, standing in the lot.</TE>
<TE>   One car sat there for more than a month. It belonged to a broker
killed in the attacks, and his widow was unable to bring herself to move
it.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts and her staff alerted the police officer who patrols Plandome
Road, and the car wasn't ticketed, wasn't towed, wasn't touched. In fact,
a steady procession of visitors covered it with flags, candles and notes.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the widow would appear. People would watch as she
settled into the car's front seat and stared straight ahead, trying to
summon the strength to turn the key.</TE>
<TE>   At last, the widow's father-in-law came and moved the car.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Molloy, who recently helped raise $135,000 for the families of
Manhasset victims, grew up elsewhere on Long Island but became part of
the community when she married a native. Recently, a few old friends
visited Molloy, and she took them to Louie's Manhasset Restaurant for
lunch. The friends marveled at all the people who stopped by Molloy's
table to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'You have a million friends!' " Molloy recalls. "I said,
'It's not friends, really. It's just how it is here.' "</TE>
<TE>   Louie's is where residents stop before boarding their morning trains
to Manhattan. Newspapers, cup of coffee, see you tomorrow, Louie. Just
after Sept. 11, Lillian Orofino went there to search for faces.</TE>
<TE>   There can't be a perfect list of the dead in Manhasset, because the
town claims many who grew up here, or had roots here, but didn't live
here at the time of the attacks. So Louie's, Orofino knew, would be the
best place to gauge the town's loss: If someone stopped appearing at
Louie's, the reasons were likely to be ominous.</TE>
<TE>   After a few weeks, she spotted a man she hadn't seen since the attacks
and nearly hugged him. She didn't know the man, but she was overcome with
joy, and relief, because she'd presumed he was dead.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happens in a small town," she says. "You don't know
everybody. But you know everybody's face."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the cooks at Louie's still watch the faces, still listen for
those special orders no longer ordered. The man who came in every
morning--short stack of flapjacks, regular coffee, two sugars--will never
come again. On weekends, he would bring his wife and children. Now, when
the wife and children stop in without him, it breaks everyone's hearts.</TE>
<TE>   There is a rumor in town that the wife and children of another
vanished customer are selling their house, moving away. Hard times, say
the people sitting at Louie's counter.</TE>
<TE>   Walter France, a Plandome Road real estate agent who coached the local
Little League teams for years, says 4,500 houses make up the town of
Manhasset, lovely Dutch Colonials and tidy old Tudors, some with lawns
running like fairways from the street to the front door. Each year, 160
houses are sold, half to people born in Manhasset, "kids who want to come
home."</TE>
<TE>   Coming home to Manhasset is a coup: Of 40 houses currently on the
market, the least expensive is $575,000. Three are priced at $3 million,
four at $2 million. "The working class doesn't come back anymore," France
says. "It's all Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   France sits in his office, monitoring foot traffic along Plandome
Road. Minutes ago, he says, a mother stopped in to say hello. Her son
died in the World Trade Center. "She had a smile on her face," he says,
"and a wet handkerchief in her hand that she was crying into."</TE>
<TE>   France coached the woman's son 25 years ago. Of 13 players on that
eighth-grade basketball team, he says, three died in the World Trade
Center, a fourth lost his brother-in-law. "Three boys on one team,"
France says. "What are the odds?"</TE>
<TE>   A few steps up Plandome Road, at Phil's Manhasset Sports Shop, Little
League players still bound through the door after school, as they have
since the store opened in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Some days, the boys actually spend money on a new mitt or a pair of
tube socks. Most days, though, they just spill soda, knock things over,
roughhouse, until one of the clerks chases them off.</TE>
<TE>   Same as always. And yet, not the same, because some of the boys have
lost coaches, uncles, fathers. So the clerks go easier on them these
days. "They can break the place up if they want," says Tim O'Connell, a
financial advisor who volunteers at the store.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Ruggiero, the 90-year-old owner of the shop, remembers when
Plandome Road was a dirt path. He's seen an endless procession up and
down Plandome Road--sons and daughters of Manhasset marching past his
window, followed by their sons and daughters, and nothing has ever really
changed. Until now.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst thing to ever happen to this town," he says.</TE>
<TE>   On Memorial Day, Ruggiero notes, the parade starts at the bottom of
Plandome Road and ends at the top. The whole town turns out, there are
flags everywhere, and the local newspaper publishes the names of every
resident who died in war.</TE>
<TE>   Same thing every year.</TE>
<TE>   But this year, the newspaper also will publish the names of those who
died in the World Trade Center--a number that exceeds the town's total
dead in the Civil War, World War I, Korea and Vietnam.</TE>

<LD>Officials of the Bush administration have asked a federal judge to
invalidate protection of several hundred thousand acres of land deemed
essential for the survival of two Southern California endangered species.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the officials at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say
they are considering whether to reevaluate up to 10 such "critical
habitat" designations involving millions of acres of land, primarily in
California.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most controversial provisions of the Endangered Species
Act, critical habitat is a category of protected land in which
development and other uses can be limited or even barred to ensure the
survival of imperiled plants and animals.</LD>
<TE>   Critical habitat designations stalled a housing project on behalf of a
rare snake in Contra Costa County in the Bay Area and evicted fishing
trawlers from Alaskan waters favored by endangered Steller sea lions.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the plan to reevaluate critical habitats has sparked a heated
debate between environmentalists and Bush administration officials over
whether changing the designations would lead to less land being protected
and periods of time when the land isn't protected at all.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fish and Wildlife Service is taking a dive," said Andrew Wetzler,
an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council's Los Angeles
office. "The bottom line is that millions of acres of habitat around the
country are going to lose the protection they now enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's an exaggeration," countered Chris Tollefson, spokesman
at Fish and Wildlife headquarters in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Tollefson confirmed that the service wants to lift such protections on
more than half a million acres in Southern California while it retools
its economic analysis of habitat designated in 2000 for a tiny songbird,
the coastal California gnatcatcher, and a freshwater crustacean, the San
Diego fairy shrimp. The agency's review could take two years or more.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife officials believe that the gnatcatcher and fairy
shrimp are shielded sufficiently by other parts of the Endangered Species
Act, Tollefson said.</TE>
<TE>   Before designating critical habitat, the service is legally required
to analyze the economic impacts on developers, property owners, cities
and others who have an interest in the land. Until last year, nearly all
of those analyses had said that creating critical habitat would not make
it much more expensive to use the land commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Developers, ranchers, farmers and others have long argued that habitat
designations were far costlier than the government said they were. The
Endangered Species Act already prohibits the killing of species, but
designation as a critical habitat protects places where endangered
species are likely to dwell, requiring developers to step more gingerly
on the land.</TE>
<TE>   One developer-funded study in California estimated that proposed
gnatcatcher critical habitat alone would cost the state $5.5 billion in
lost jobs, housing and property value over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>Declines Blamed on Habitat Loss</TE>
<TE>   In California, the wildlife service said that the impacts from the
gnatcatcher and fairy shrimp designations would be minimal--a finding
that developers said was absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on--500,000 acres of prime Southern California real estate,
arguably some of the most expensive real estate in the country--a
regulatory enactment of this magnitude is going to have zero economic
impact?" said David Smith, general counsel for the Building Industry
Assn. of Southern California. "That they even tried to pull that was
astonishing."</TE>
<TE>   The issue has particular resonance in California, which has more
endangered species than any other state except Hawaii. California species
whose habitat is under review include the the Alameda whipsnake, the
red-legged frog, the Riverside fairy shrimp, and the Southwestern arroyo
toad. For the frog alone, the service has designated 4.1 million acres in
28 counties.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that habitat loss is the main reason why
species go extinct and that without critical habitat designations, the
Endangered Species Act cannot ensure the survival of the plants and
animals it is supposed to protect.</TE>
<TE>   Landowners counter that critical habitat spawns unnecessary, costly
red tape.</TE>
<TE>   For many property owners, the designations amount to little more than
lines on a map. But compliance can be problematic if a landowner depends
on federal subsidies or permits--as many major developers and ranchers
do.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most contentious designations have been on land that is
not currently occupied by imperiled species but could be inhabited in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Service officials initially balked at designating critical habitat in
many areas, saying its budget was limited and its staff should focus on
listing newly endangered species. However, a flurry of lawsuits by
environmentalists forced the service in the late 1990s to start
designating habitat for hundreds of species in the West. Some Fish and
Wildlife officials said last week that critical habitat has cost them
more in publicity and landowners' ire than it has been worth.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's latest decision to reevaluate habitat
designations coincides with a slew of lawsuits brought by developers and
other landowners nationwide, challenging how the government conducted its
financial analyses of the habitat. Landowners' attorneys praised the
move.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that for the first time, there will be an honest,
thorough analysis of economic impact," said Robert Thornton, an attorney
representing the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California and toll
road builders in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But Thornton said that "no one in the case is arguing that there
should be no critical habitat. The issue is what should the critical
habitat be and what kind of economic analysis should be done."</TE>
<TE>   The land at issue in Southern California is covered with sage scrub,
where the threatened gnatcatcher builds its nests, and dotted with
seasonal pools that are home to the endangered fairy shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the gnatcatcher, a time-consuming reevaluation of the
bird's habitat, environmentalists predict, would allow substantial
commercial intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   Two transportation agencies want to build a toll road that would
bisect a state park in southern Orange County that is part of the
gnatcatcher's currently protected habitat. In addition, Rancho Mission
Viejo, a family-owned company, wants to build 14,000 homes in the same
area, all in gnatcatcher critical habitat.</TE>
<TE>Economic Impact Must Be Studied</TE>
<TE>   The company has challenged that designation in court, claiming that
gnatcatchers are believed to occupy only 6,157 acres of ranch property,
but that more than 29,000 acres have been deemed critical habitat.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for a review of some critical habitat designations, the
administration says it is following the lead of a federal appeals court
ruling last May that struck down protection of streamside habitat in New
Mexico for another bird, the Southwestern willow flycatcher.</TE>
<TE>   The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the process used to
decide what lands to protect did not adequately analyze the economic
impact on property owners and others who make a living from the land.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do the best economic analysis we can and do it
consistently," Tollefson said. "We understand why the court decided the
way it did, and we're going to comply with that and broaden that to
comply with the spirit of the court's order in other parts of country
that aren't covered by the court's decision."</TE>
<TE>   He said the service has not yet determined whether existing critical
habitat designations for more than 140 species around the country comply
with the 10th Circuit's ruling. Because of budget restrictions, Tollefson
said, he does not anticipate a widespread review, but one focused on new
designations or ones being challenged in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   The other federal agency that oversees endangered species--the
National Marine Fisheries Service--has asked a federal judge in
Washington to redo critical habitat designations for some populations of
salmon and steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be considering on a case-by-case basis the appropriateness of
rolling back critical habitat designations," said Fisheries Service
spokesman Gordon Helm.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southern California cases, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen
Wilson is scheduled to decide on Feb. 25 in Los Angeles whether to roll
back critical habitat designations for the gnatcatcher on 513,650 acres
in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
The judge is to make a similar decision concerning 4,025 acres of habitat
for the fairy shrimp in Orange and San Diego Counties.</TE>
<TE>   A backlog of overdue designations means that revised habitat areas may
not be completed for the gnatcatcher until October 2004 and for the fairy
shrimp until April 2005, at the earliest, according to court documents
filed by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say this delay is unacceptable because two major
developments in southern Orange County--the Rancho Mission Viejo project
and the toll road--could be approved before new designations are in
place.</TE>
<TE>   "The date the government requests is particularly disturbing because
the Fish and Wildlife Service is well aware of these proposals," Wetzler
said.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (2 photos) The dispute between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and environmentalists centers on the question of how habitat for
endangered species should be protected. In Southern California, the fairy
shrimp and gnatcatcher have been a source of dispute between developers
and those who say land must be set aside to help the species survive.</CP>

<DH>Politics: Finnish-born Marutei Tsurunen, the Asian nation's first
Western lawmaker, vows to be an advocate for resident foreigners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>He calls himself Japan's first "lawmaker with blue eyes," and he
has a mission: to end racial discrimination in this long-homogenous
culture.</LD>
<LD>   Marutei Tsurunen, a 61-year-old naturalized Japanese citizen of
Finnish heritage, took his seat in parliament last week amid lots of
media attention and a pledge to fight social bias using his new platform
as the first Westerner to serve in the Diet.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years ago, the idea of a Caucasian lawmaker in Japan would have
been unthinkable. But Japanese these days are beginning to identify
themselves more in terms of nationality than race, said Shingo Mabuchi,
an associate sociology professor at Nara University.</LD>
<TE>   Foreigners have also made inroads in a number of traditional areas in
recent years, including sumo wrestling, baseball, TV entertainment and
universities. The political arena represents a natural next step,
Tsurunen said.</TE>
<TE>   Tsurunen's path to parliament hasn't been easy. As a member of the
opposition Democratic Party of Japan, he ran for office four times and
only succeeded this month after the seat was vacated by another
official's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   The Finn, who was born Martti Turunen, arrived in Japan in 1967 as a
missionary and worked for several years in an orphanage before becoming
an English teacher, translator and author. After marrying a Japanese
woman, he became naturalized in 1979, won election to a local assembly in
1992 and launched his first bid for national office in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   After Tsurunen was elected as an assemblyman in the town of Yugawara,
he shook things up by airing some of the assembly's dirty laundry. Fellow
representatives accused him of bad-mouthing the town.</TE>
<TE>   Tsurunen said Friday that he then realized he'd be able to accomplish
more by taking a lower profile and seeking change from within, an
approach he plans to continue in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern in Japan, Tsurunen said Friday, are large
numbers of residents of Korean descent who aren't allowed to vote, run
for office or enjoy many other basic Japanese rights--even though many of
them don't speak Korean and are the third or fourth generation born in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "There are almost 2 million foreigners who are not citizens of Japan,
and their situation is still very weak compared to Japanese," he said in
a news conference Friday at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan. "I
want to make their life better."</TE>
<TE>   Japan's newest lawmaker added that the country should stop pressuring
foreign residents, particularly other Asians, to assimilate and should
instead allow them to keep their cultural identity.</TE>
<TE>   The world's second-largest economy is still grappling with many
racial, cultural and migration issues despite a rapidly aging population
that will almost certainly force the nation to open its doors wider in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   Cheol Eun Bae, a spokesman for the Korean Residents Union in Japan,
welcomed Tsurunen's election, adding that he hopes that the lawmaker can
pressure Japan to ease requirements on running for local office in
addition to expanding local voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroshi Takaku, an independent political analyst, said Tsurunen isn't
likely to have a major impact on the substance or style of Japanese
politics, a world often defined by payoff scandals and dirty deals.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see how he'll do in Japan's closed,
smoke-filled rooms," Takaku said. "But one person acting alone can't
change the system."</TE>
<TE>   Tsurunen's ultimate contribution may be to show the outside world that
Japan is changing, and to remind Japanese that they need to keep
expanding their world view, said Makoto Tsuruki, a sociologist at Tokyo
University.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still discrimination, but the situation is improving. Japan
is beginning to realize its society is not homogenous," Tsuruki added.</TE>
<TE>   Tsurunen said Friday that his main focus beyond foreigner rights would
be the environment and foreign relations.</TE>

<HD>Vatican to Open Some WWII-Era Files on Pius XII</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Scholars examining the pope's stance on the Holocaust say
the disclosure could answer only two of their 47 questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Vatican, seeking to answer criticism that Pope Pius XII did
little to oppose the Nazi slaughter of Jews, pledged Friday to open some
of its secret World War II-era archives next year.</LD>
<LD>   It said that Pope John Paul II is speeding up the scheduled release of
selected files "to help bring an end to unjust and ungrateful
speculation" about a predecessor he has hailed as "a great pope."</LD>
<LD>   Seymour D. Reich, the Jewish coordinator of a panel of Roman Catholic
and Jewish historians studying the period, called the partial opening a
disappointment. He said the documents promised next year could answer no
more than two of the panel's 47 questions about the wartime pontiff's
attitude toward the Holocaust.</LD>
<TE>   Without fuller Vatican disclosure, Reich said, the other answers will
remain hidden in other files that, according to Friday's announcement,
are to be released starting in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Pius XII's public silence on the Holocaust is one of the most
sensitive issues in Catholic-Jewish relations.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican scholars say Pius XII worked behind the scenes to help Jews.
Jewish leaders want the record set straight before the Vatican advances
toward his beatification, a step that would put him on the road to
sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   "Any release of documents is a positive step, but we hope that this
signals what independent scholars have been asking for--unfettered access
to the archives," said Elan Steinberg, executive vice president of the
World Jewish Congress. "It would make no sense to beatify him and then
see what the historical verdict is."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul has made rapprochement with Jews a hallmark of his papacy.
But a 1998 Vatican document atoning for Roman Catholic acts of
anti-Semitism absolved Pius XII of long-standing charges that he
facilitated the Holocaust by remaining silent.</TE>
<TE>   In response to Jewish criticism of that document, the Vatican
appointed Catholic historians to study the scant 11 volumes of wartime
files the Vatican has made public--and invited Jewish historians to join
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic-Jewish panel's report in October 2000 portrayed Pius XII
as a pope engaged in fruitless diplomacy as reports of Nazi atrocities
poured into the Vatican, but it withheld final judgment. The historians
said the 11 volumes left out Vatican responses to those atrocity reports,
and they asked for new archives that would help answer 47 questions.</TE>
<TE>   The historians suspended work last July after the Vatican declined to
provide the relevant files.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's Vatican announcement aimed to end the standoff. The files
promised next year deal with the Holy See's relations with Germany from
1922 to 1939, during the papacy of Pius XII's predecessor, Pius XI. The
future Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, was the Holy See's ambassador to
Germany and secretary of state during part of that period.</TE>
<TE>   Without giving a timetable, the Vatican also promised documents on
wartime prisoners and said they will show that Pius XII carried out
"great works of charity and help" for prisoners of "all nations,
religions and races."</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican said documents about its relations with Germany during
Pius XII's papacy, which lasted from 1939 to 1958, would be released only
after the entire 1922-39 archive is opened about three years from now.
The process is slow, the announcement said, because of a shortage of
specialized archivists to catalog the files.</TE>
<TE>   "It is regrettable that the Vatican is still reluctant to open all the
relevant archives," said Reich, who heads the International Jewish
Committee on Interreligious Consultations. He said the panel of
historians should not meet again "until we have all the material we asked
for."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the panel's questions deal with the period covered by files
promised next year. One involves Pacelli's input in drafts of Pius XI's
1937 encyclical condemning Nazism and racism. The other asks how Pacelli,
as secretary of state, reacted to an appeal by a German Catholic prelate
for Vatican condemnation of Kristallnacht, the anti-Jewish riots of 1938
that foreshadowed the extermination of 6 million European Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the panel's questions cover Pacelli's behavior as pope, Reich
said. As Jews were being slaughtered in 1941, for example, the archbishop
of Berlin asked Pius XII to "issue an appeal in favor of these
unfortunates."</TE>
<TE>   The panel asked: "What impression did the archbishop's words make on
Pius XII? What discussions, if any, took place about making such a public
appeal? And was any further information about Nazi anti-Jewish policy
sought?"</TE>

<HD>New Kosovo Administrator Tells Parties to Make Up</HD>
<DH>Balkans: U.N. appointee Michael Steiner assails bickering
politicians for weeks of delay in forming a government after elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Kosovo's new U.N. administrator, Michael Steiner, warned feuding
local politicians Friday that the time has come for them to stop
bickering and strike a deal on forming a new government.</LD>
<LD>   A new Kosovo parliament elected in November to provide a measure of
self-rule in the separatist province remains paralyzed by a three-way
standoff among moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, former
ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serbian representatives.</LD>
<LD>   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo placed first in the elections.
But it failed to win the majority of seats needed to govern alone and has
refused rival parties' demands for a power-sharing deal.</LD>
<TE>   Steiner, a veteran German diplomat and Balkan specialist with a
reputation for combining brilliance and arrogance, announced Friday at
his first formal news conference that he will primarily be "in the
listening mode" for his first few weeks here. He then promptly criticized
parliament's failure to get moving.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to overdramatize the fact that time has elapsed between
the elections and the nomination of the government," Steiner said. "But I
think it's now becoming high time that the parties get their act
together."</TE>
<TE>   Citing his pledge to listen first, Steiner declined to propose how the
deadlock should be broken.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner, 52, arrived in Kosovo on Thursday, replacing a Danish
predecessor, Hans Haekkerup, who left in December after a year in office.</TE>
<TE>   Although administered by the United Nations, the predominantly ethnic
Albanian region technically remains a province of Serbia, the main
Yugoslav republic. Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo see self-government as
an important step toward independence, and there is widespread public
frustration with the politicians' failure to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.N.-established rules, the 120-seat parliament must first elect
a president by majority vote. The president will then nominate a prime
minister, who will head a government with broad powers.</TE>
<TE>   But in three rounds of voting in December and January, Rugova, the
leading candidate for president, won just 51 votes in his strongest
showing, well short of the 61 needed to win the post.</TE>
<TE>   With 22 seats in parliament, the Serbian party, the Return Coalition,
could give the presidency to Rugova. But so far it has declined to do so,
and accepting Serbian support to win the post would carry long-term
political risks for Rugova.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner noted Friday that the job of the first head of the U.N.
mission, Bernard Kouchner, had been to deal with a humanitarian crisis
and to set up an international administration after peacekeepers entered
the province in June 1999 in the wake of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's 11-week air campaign. Haekkerup in turn had overseen
administrative changes and the holding of elections, Steiner said.</TE>
<TE>   The main task now, Steiner said, is to turn over much of his own power
to the new local government--once it is set up. He also stressed the need
for economic growth, more jobs and better security for Kosovo's besieged
Serbian population, which despite the large international peacekeeping
presence here still cannot move freely outside ethnic enclaves for fear
of attacks by ethnic Albanians.</TE>
<TE>   A student radical in his youth, Steiner first won prominence in 1989
when, as a junior diplomat in Czechoslovakia, he was filmed by television
crews as he helped people over the West German Embassy wall into the
compound so they could flee the Soviet bloc.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991 Steiner headed a German humanitarian aid office in Zagreb, the
Croatian capital. He was Germany's key negotiator on Yugoslav issues in
1994 and 1995 and served as the deputy head of the international
administration in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1996 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner resigned as German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's foreign
policy advisor in November after coming under fire in the nation's media
for allegedly insulting German soldiers while on a plane at Moscow's
airport. Steiner said during the controversy that his comments had been
misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   Steiner is scheduled to meet with Kosovo's political leaders over the
weekend.</TE>

<HD>Israel Raids Gaza as Criticism Grows</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A Palestinian policeman is slain. Army confirms officer's
death in a West Bank accident and faces pressure at home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli warplanes struck a security compound in the northern Gaza
Strip on Friday night, killing a Palestinian policeman and wounding 25
people, Palestinian authorities said. The raid came a day after three
Israeli soldiers died in the same area when a powerful mine blew apart
their heavily armored tank.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Friday, the Israeli army confirmed that the commander of an
elite unit had died in what it called a freak accident during a predawn
raid on a West Bank village. Lt. Col. Eyal Weiss, who was crushed by a
collapsing wall, was the highest-ranking commanding officer to die in 16
1/2 months of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of an officer, three soldiers and a Merkava-3 tank in less
than 24 hours was a blow to an army that finds itself increasingly
criticized for the tactics it is using against the Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza.</LD>
<TE>   Politicians and military analysts have called the army slow, clumsy
and too bureaucratic. And in a growing protest movement, more than 200
reserve combat soldiers and officers have said they will no longer serve
in the West Bank and Gaza because they consider the army's behavior there
immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli voters also are expressing discontent with their government.
In a poll published Friday in the daily Maariv newspaper, 49% of 590
respondents said they felt that the "national leadership has lost control
of the security situation," while 44% said it has not lost control and 7%
said they didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Hemi Shalev wrote in Maariv that the poll indicates
that Israelis are in a state of "steadily growing confusion" about a
conflict that appears to have neither a political nor a military
solution. A majority of those polled--54%--said they are dissatisfied
with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's performance on security issues. But
48% said they believe that Israel is winning in the clash with the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Shalev called it "frightening" that 35% of those polled said Israel
should transfer--expel--Palestinian residents from the West Bank and Gaza
to Arab countries.</TE>
<TE>   "But perhaps what is more serious and more dangerous is the public
feeling that there is no one at home, that the ship is being tossed in a
stormy sea and that its captain is out of ideas," Shalev wrote. "This is
an extreme situation that could even lead to seeking extreme solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The national sense of gloom deepened Friday after the commander of the
army's Central Command, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, detailed Weiss' death at
a Tel Aviv news conference. The 34-year-old commander headed Duvdevan,
the undercover unit whose troops often wear disguises in carrying out
special operations.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday morning, the unit entered the Palestinian-controlled
village of Pzeita, near Tulkarm, looking for a suspected local leader of
Islamic Jihad, a militant group that has carried out a string of suicide
bombings inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it had cornered Jasser Abdel Radad in a three-story
house and began demolishing the building with bulldozers after he refused
to surrender. When Radad threw down his weapon and emerged, Weiss took
him behind a concrete wall across the street for interrogation as the
demolition continued, Eitan said.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, when the tractor was completing its work, part of the
house, either from the ceiling or from a wall, flew across the road and
struck the wall behind which the unit commander was standing," Eitan
said. Weiss was killed instantly, he said, in what he called "first-class
bad luck." Radad was unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Israeli warplanes launched the Gaza raid, in the second
phase of retaliation for the attack on the tank Thursday. Tanks and
bulldozers had already rumbled into the area Friday morning, demolishing
police posts and crops, Palestinians reported.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Israeli army officers said the Palestinians' ability to destroy
the sophisticated tank took them by surprise. The army will have to
rethink its use of tanks to guard roads leading to Jewish settlements now
that it knows Palestinian militants can blow them up, military analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The army's second response came shortly after nightfall. F-16 fighter
jets dropped what the Palestinians said were three bombs on one of the
compounds of the Palestinian national security forces outside the
Jabaliya refugee camp. Hours later, rescue crews were still digging for
victims in the rubble, said Maj. Gen. Abdel Razek Majaydeh, chief of the
Palestinian police in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing that justifies this escalation," he said, "and it
will bring the whole area into a cycle of violence that has no end."</TE>

<HD>Milosevic to Summon Leaders to the Stand</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>Heatedly rejecting charges of mass murder and deportations, former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said Friday that he will call
former President Clinton and a host of world leaders to testify that he
brought peace to the Balkans.</LD>
<LD>   After an exhaustive two-day narrative to the U.N. war crimes tribunal,
the lines of Milosevic's defense were clear: He is the victim, not the
villain, and his judges and Western governments are conspirators in
crimes against Serbs.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic said that those he intends to summon include Clinton, former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and leaders from Germany and Italy.</LD>
<TE>   "I am going to use my right to request the examination and
cross-examination of witnesses who were direct actors in all the events,"
Milosevic said, referring to his meetings with Western leaders during the
1991-99 wars in the Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   The court said Milosevic has the right to call witnesses in his
defense against the charges of genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and crimes
against humanity in Croatia and Kosovo. But he must convince the court
that they are relevant before it will issue the subpoenas.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic, 60, could face life imprisonment if convicted of any of 66
charges against him in one of the most important war crimes trial since
World War II. He is the first head of state to be charged with war crimes
while in power.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic noted that he was praised as a peacemaker when he
signed--under Clinton's pressure--the 1995 Dayton, Ohio, accord, which
ended the Bosnian war. Four years later, he was indicted for war crimes
for his bloody crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. The crackdown prompted an
11-week air war by North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "How is it that I had overall support in '95, '96 and '97 and now, a
whole decade later, I become the object of charges none other than
genocide?" Milosevic asked.</TE>

<HD>Deadly Winter Stills Butterflies' Wings in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Freezing temperatures devastate the population. Many
blame man-made threats for aiding the migrating insects' demise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ANGANGUEO, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>A trek through the 9,000-foot-high pine forests of the El Rosario
sanctuary normally leads to a breathtaking spectacle this time of year:
As the winter sun hits the boughs of the trees in midmorning, millions of
monarch butterflies begin to quiver and shimmer, and then take flight.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the butterflies are visible, but they are still. Killed in
mid-January by a brutal freeze, they are piled inches deep along both
sides of the path.</LD>
<LD>   The days are still so cold that even the surviving monarchs remain
motionless, bunched together for warmth in living clumps that dangle from
the branches of the towering, rod-straight oyamel trees.</LD>
<TE>   In past years, visitors could watch the sky glitter with the awakening
black-and-orange monarchs. They could stand transfixed on the steep path
as thousands of butterflies swarmed around them, some alighting on
sweaters and hats as the insects raced down into the nearby valley to
feed on milkweed plants.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of nature's magical pageants, more remarkable because
these butterflies migrate all the way from Canada each autumn and somehow
always find their way back to the same dozen or so mountaintops in the
states of Michoacan and Mexico, about a three-hour drive west of Mexico
City. They head north again in March, some inner compass guiding their
journey.</TE>
<TE>   This year, rotting butterflies give off a faint sickly sweet smell
like the innards of a carved pumpkin. Groups of children look for small
joy in seeing a few living butterflies resting on a tree stump.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists reported this week that about 80% of the population at El
Rosario and 74% at the nearby Sierra Chincua sanctuary--or as many as 250
million butterflies--probably perished in the freeze. Veteran butterfly
scientist Lincoln P. Brower of Sweet Briar College in Virginia, who led
the study for World Wildlife Fund-Mexico, said he found piles a foot deep
in places. He called it by far the worst die-off he had seen in 25 years
of studying the monarch.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easier to dismiss this phenomenon as just a profound
display of the force of nature if it weren't for the man-made threats
that have made the butterflies' sojourn constantly riskier. The lands
around El Rosario and Chincua have been ravaged by deforestation in
recent decades, much of it through illegal logging for commercial lumber.</TE>
<TE>   Government efforts to reduce the cutting, especially an innovative
program introduced in 2000 to compensate villagers for not logging, have
had some success. But many believe that the gradual reduction of havens
for the butterflies contributed to their fate.</TE>
<TE>   The die-off is more disconcerting because it is the second in two
years. Last year, some activists worried that pesticide poisoning caused
a rash of butterfly deaths in other reserves, but experts determined that
a freeze was the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   This year, a heavy snowfall came first, which the butterflies can
survive. But two days of freezing rain followed, soaking the butterflies
and dragging them to the ground. Scientists say the monarch population is
vulnerable but will rebound.</TE>
<TE>   The people of the old mining town of Angangueo and surrounding farming
villages have seen their three-month tourist season decimated by the
disaster, as word has spread and visitors have opted to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctuaries have provided work for hundreds of local residents,
and people here had begun to recognize that the butterflies and their
habitat were a resource that could be worth more than sawed wood.</TE>
<TE>   Laborers at El Rosario had just finished building a handsome trail of
sturdy, ochre-colored concrete stairs up the hillside, making the climb
easier for children and older people and reducing the dust clouds and
slippery mud of years past. Other villagers have set up stalls selling
butterfly magnets and pencils and T-shirts. This week the stalls were
mostly closed, and dozens of would-be guides stood idle at the reserve's
gates.</TE>
<TE>   One recent weekday morning, only a handful of stalwart tourists made
the journey up from the town. One driver, Enrique, said his transport
service, using an ancient Chevrolet Suburban, had seen a big drop in
business compared with last year.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will cross the border illegally in March, heading for
Tennessee to work in a Chinese restaurant. He is one of tens of thousands
people in Michoacan who migrate like the butterflies each year, in search
of economic opportunities that the monarchs cannot seem to provide at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican writer who was born in Michoacan and who has
fought to protect the reserves since the 1980s, said "the scientists and
the government say this [die-off] is a natural phenomenon. Yes, but it is
aggravated by deforestation. They should declare a moratorium on all
logging in the sanctuaries. . . . The most depressing spectacle on those
highways is to see trucks full of cut tree trunks coming down from the
mountains all day long."</TE>
<TE>   Aridjis, who is lecturing this semester at UC Irvine, added: "In a
country where the environment is so damaged and so polluted, the
migration of the monarchs is the liberation of the spirit. It is a poetic
journey, it is a journey of the imagination. But there always has been
conflict between destruction and protection, between human beings and the
butterflies. It has been very frustrating."</TE>

<LD>Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider, who drew strong criticism
for his visit to Iraq, said Friday that he would quit national politics
and focus on his role as governor of Carinthia province.</LD>
<LD>   Haider, whose meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday
was described as inappropriate by the United States, said he had quit his
position on the policymaking committee of Austria's coalition government.</LD>
<LD>   Some members of the anti-immigration Freedom Party also criticized
their populist former leader for the trip.</LD>
<TE>   "I do not want to be seen as interfering and so I will quit national
politics," Haider told national broadcaster ORF after accusations from
within his party that he meddled in leadership affairs despite quitting
as party chief in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I have left the committee as of today. I will concentrate on my role
as governor of Carinthia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee sets government policy and consists of members of
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel's conservative People's Party and its
coalition partner, the Freedom Party.</TE>

<HD>China Expels Western Falun Gong Members</HD>
<DH>Sect: Protesters who returned to U.S. say they had been beaten by
police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT
</DL>
<LD>About 25 members of Falun Gong expelled from China after protesting
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square returned to the United States on Friday,
displaying bruises, cuts and scrapes from what they said were police
beatings.</LD>
<LD>   "I was trying to say 'Falun Gong is good,' but they kept hitting me
over and over again," Mark Gardner, 22, of Brea, Calif., said as he
arrived in Detroit on a Northwest Airlines flight from China.</LD>
<LD>   China expelled 33 Americans, four Britons and five Germans detained
during a protest Thursday by foreign members of Falun Gong, diplomats
said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Gardner had a black eye. Many of the others had dirty and torn
clothes, and some were not wearing shoes at the Detroit airport as they
left to catch connecting flights.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese police said they detained more than 40 foreigners during the
protest against a 2 1/2-year-old crackdown on the spiritual movement. The
demonstration was the biggest yet by foreign followers in the square.</TE>
<TE>   The protest came a week before a visit by President Bush to Beijing.
Possibly to avert a diplomatic backlash, Chinese authorities took the
unusual step of issuing a statement saying they had treated the detainees
humanely.</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong activists in New York said as many as 100 followers had
planned to take part in the protest, but those at the Detroit airport
said they did not know the whereabouts of the others. The Chinese
authorities' statement said 14 Europeans were detained in their hotel
rooms before the protest.</TE>
<TE>   The activists said protesters tried to unfurl a banner and shout
protest slogans.</TE>
<TE>   Although many previous protests by the group took police by surprise,
authorities appeared to have been prepared for Thursday's event.</TE>
<TE>   Checkpoints were set up around Tiananmen Square and foreigners were
forced to show identification and open their bags for inspection. Foreign
reporters were turned away or held near the square, preventing them from
seeing clearly what happened.</TE>
<TE>   In November, 35 Western members of Falun Gong were expelled after a
protest in the square.</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong, loosely based on traditional Chinese religions and martial
arts, drew millions of followers in the mid-1990s. It was banned in China
in 1999 as a threat to public safety and Communist rule.</TE>

<HD>6 Are Accused in Afghan Slaying</HD>
<DH>Asia: Interim prime minister alleges that the senior aides plotted
the killing of his aviation minister as part of a political feud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai on Friday accused high-ranking
government officials of masterminding the brutal slaying of Afghanistan's
aviation minister, who was killed during a riot at Kabul's airport a day
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai charged that those responsible were motivated by a
long-standing feud over political allegiances with the slain official,
Air Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul Rahman.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, it had appeared that a mob of Muslim pilgrims had beaten
Rahman to death in a rage over delays for flights to the annual Muslim
pilgrimage, known as the hajj, to the Saudi holy city of Mecca. It was
unclear how the government officials might have been involved in his
death.</LD>
<TE>   The allegations were perhaps the most unsettling sign that the
factionalism that has long divided Afghanistan continues to fester even
in the highest ranks of the fledgling administration, whose primary
challenge is to restore law, order and unity to the war-torn nation.</TE>
<TE>   "He was killed by people who planned it," Karzai told reporters Friday
night, accusing six senior government officials of the crime. Three were
arrested Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The accused men include Gen. Abdullah Jan Tawhidi, in charge of
Afghanistan's intelligence service, and Gen. Kalandar Beg, a deputy in
the Defense Ministry. The others are members of the intelligence service
and the Justice Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the suspects went to Saudi Arabia with the pilgrims. "We are
asking the Saudis to arrest them and bring them back. We will try them.
We will put them behind bars," Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the substantial law-and-order problems here, a soccer
match between a squad of international peacekeepers and an Afghan team
turned ugly Friday. Crowds desperate to enter the packed stadium were
beaten back by local police wielding rifle butts and tree branches.</TE>
<TE>   It was among the most serious challenges yet to the 3,200-member force
dispatched by several nations to help police keep order.</TE>
<TE>   A German peacekeeper fired his automatic rifle into the air, and
several others targeted the mob with tear gas and pepper spray, while
another took a cue from the Afghan police and starting shoving people
with his rifle butt. Austrian peacekeepers used guard dogs and fire
extinguishers to bring the crowd under control. Fifty soldiers and
Afghans were injured but none seriously.</TE>
<TE>   The soccer riot echoed the earlier mob scene at the airport. Clad in
white sheets or robes and plastic sandals, hundreds of Afghans had been
milling around the dilapidated airport's runway by day and spending the
freezing nights in an airport mosque so overcrowded that one woman was
said to have died.</TE>
<TE>   When Rahman boarded the chartered plane belonging to Afghanistan's
national airline, Ariana, bound for New Delhi, where he had been in exile
for much of the Taliban's rule, the crowd became enraged, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Witness Mohammed Rahim said the pilgrims surrounded the plane as it
prepared to take off and appealed for the minister to address the crowd.
As he emerged from the plane and began descending the steps, the minister
fell--it wasn't clear whether he tripped or was pushed by others--to the
runway, where he broke his teeth and was mobbed by the crowd, Rahim said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear whether the accused officials were on the plane, part
of the crowd or there at all. Several officials of Ariana Airways were
injured, although one Western official said they had been injured in the
main terminal building.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd at the airport included pilgrims, many of their family
members and just about anybody who wanted to be there. Just before the
killing, security at the airport was so lax that a foreign reporter
walked directly onto the runway through an open gate where many pilgrims
stood before being shooed away by a guard who warned of "security"
threats.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday morning, however, the airport was ringed with police and
guards, who stopped all but officials and pilgrims.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, Afghan pilgrims were having problems getting
to Mecca, a journey that financially and physically able Muslims are
urged to make at least once.</TE>
<TE>   Most had paid about $1,500 for their tickets, a king's ransom in this
impoverished nation. Thousands also were stranded at airports in Herat in
the west and Kandahar in the south. Some had traveled to Kabul, thinking
that they had a better chance of getting on, and were camping out in the
capital's central mosque.</TE>

<HD>Lindh's Trial Set for Late August</HD>
<DH>Courts: The judge may consider a delay because of proximity to the
anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</DH>

<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh will face an August trial date on charges that he
took up arms against the United States, a federal judge decided Friday,
but the court left open the possibility that the proceeding could be
delayed until after the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to defense arguments, Judge T.S. Ellis III said he might
consider beginning jury selection after a proposed Aug. 26 start because
of the emotional observances that likely will surround the anniversary of
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney George Harris had argued for a Sept. 16 start, saying
there would be "genuine emotion in this country" in the days surrounding
Sept. 11. "For us to be in trial at that time is prejudicial to the
defendant."</LD>
<TE>   Lindh appeared at Friday's proceeding wearing a prison jumpsuit but
not handcuffed or shackled. The 21-year-old Californian is charged in a
10-count indictment with conspiring to kill Americans, using firearms at
the request of senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members, and providing
material support and resources to foreign terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh pleaded not guilty Wednesday. If convicted, he could face
multiple life terms but not the death penalty. He has not been charged
with treason.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's lawyers said that under the court's schedule--assuming that
government prosecutors take two weeks to present their case--the
defense's opening statement could fall on or around Sept 11. They warned
that the potentially emotionally charged period could lead to a
"prejudicial" atmosphere against Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "I hesitate to bring this up," Harris said. "There is no connection
between Sept. 11 and this case. But the government has attempted to make
this connection."</TE>
<TE>   Ellis disagreed with the notion that Lindh's right to a fair trial
would be affected by the date, saying that there would not be much
difference in the publicity surrounding the case whether it was held
during the anniversary or after. He also said it wasn't certain that the
defense's case would begin on the date, as the prosecution's case could
be longer or shorter than the estimated two weeks. But he did not rule
out a change.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying I won't reconsider [the date]," Ellis said. "We can
revisit this as we approach Aug. 26."</TE>
<TE>   He said the jury would be fair and impartial regardless.</TE>
<TE>   Although the prosecution accepted the trial date without objection,
both sides had sought a mid-November start. Ellis, noting that it is not
the only case on the court's docket, said Aug. 26 gives both sides
"reasonable" time to prepare.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis said he hopes that defense attorneys will be granted clearance
to view classified materials by early March, and both sides agreed to the
scheduling of hearings on the defense's access to classified materials,
with an initial hearing set for April 1. The prosecution was ordered to
produce its evidence at an April 23 hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the hearing, Lindh sat stoically and stared ahead, speaking
occasionally to his attorneys. His parents, Frank Lindh and Marilyn
Walker, sat not far behind him. After the hearing, they left without
giving any comment.</TE>

<HD>Breakthrough Expected in Kidnap Case, Pakistan Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's interior minister on Friday predicted a "major
breakthrough" and more arrests within 48 hours in the search for Daniel
Pearl. The official rejected a claim from Pearl's self-confessed
kidnapper that the Wall Street Journal reporter is dead.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they were focusing their search on two suspected Islamic
militants: Mohammed Hashim Qadeer and Imtiaz Siddiqi, both of whom were
believed to have met Pearl last month while he was researching a story on
extremist groups.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said there was "no evidence" that
Pearl had been killed, despite the claims by suspect Ahmad Omar Saeed
Sheikh in court Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant with a history of kidnapping
Westerners, "has been changing his statements," Haider told reporters in
the eastern city of Lahore.</TE>
<TE>   But a Pakistani newspaper quoted an unidentified "ranking official" as
saying Sheikh received confirmation of Pearl's death Feb. 5--the day
Sheikh says he turned himself in to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper, called the News, said that Sheikh had heard "from one
of his sources" that the 38-year-old Pearl was shot around Jan. 31 while
trying to escape. Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 while on his way to meet
Islamic militants at a restaurant in Karachi, a southern port city.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., the Journal's parent
organization, said Friday that the company is still hopeful.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Seen as 'Weakest Link' in Anti-Terror War</HD>
<DH>Asia: Three clerics' alleged role in 'sleeper cells' and
authorities' inaction fuel regional concerns that the nation is a haven
for plotters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SUNGAI MANGGIS, Malaysia
</DL>
<LD>From prayer groups to prison cells to this village of tin-roofed,
clapboard houses, three Indonesian clerics pursued their vision of an
Islamic state stretching across much of Southeast Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Operating from a secluded compound an hour from Malaysia's capital,
Kuala Lumpur, they shuttled to other Islamic lands and fanned out across
Malaysia, living on donations and urging the faithful to join a holy war
to protect Islam.</LD>
<LD>   But authorities in Malaysia and Singapore say the three Indonesians
also created terrorist "sleeper cells" that plotted to bomb targets,
including the U.S. Embassy in Singapore, and played host to two of the
Sept. 11 skyjackers in Malaysia.</LD>
<TE>   Today, one of the three is behind bars in Malaysia. Another is on the
run. The third has returned to Indonesia where he lives openly, giving
frequent interviews and praising Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged role of the clerics and a lack of action by Indonesian
authorities against suspected terrorists underscore concerns in Southeast
Asia that the world's most populous Muslim nation is becoming a haven for
those plotting attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since December, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines have arrested
more than 40 alleged members of a terrorist network known as Jemaah
Islamiah. But others escaped, authorities say, and likely fled to
Indonesia, where law enforcement is ineffective and the country's 17,508
islands offer countless hiding places.</TE>
<TE>   Among the escapees may be one of the three clerics, Riduan Isamuddin,
37, who is better known as Hambali. Authorities say he ran terrorist
activities for Jemaah Islamiah, and they also have linked him to a series
of plots by Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network, including the Sept.
11 hijackings, the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen in October
2000 and plans to blow up 12 airliners over the Pacific Ocean in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities say they have uncovered evidence that Jemaah
Islamiah terror cells are operating in Indonesia. The Indonesian
authorities have arrested no one.</TE>
<TE>   "The weakest link here is Indonesia," said a Malaysian official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "We're sharing everything with them, but
we're not getting a lot of information back."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Lavin, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, whose embassy was a
target, has urged Indonesia to crack down.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a substantial number of arrests in Singapore; we saw equally
aggressive moves in Malaysia; [but] we have not seen that kind of
response yet in Indonesia, and it is a matter of concern," he said
recently.</TE>
<TE>   Although most Indonesians are moderate Muslims, Islamic militancy has
been on the rise since President Suharto, the country's dictator for 32
years, was forced from office in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia shares a long border with Malaysia on the island of Borneo,
and many of its smaller islands are within easy striking distance of
Singapore, Malaysia and the southern Philippines. Four tons of ammonium
nitrate allegedly acquired by Jemaah Islamiah for use in terrorist
bombings in Singapore were moved recently to the Indonesian island of
Batam, about 10 miles from Singapore, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia is also hobbled by political instability, severe economic
problems and the weak leadership of President Megawati Sukarnoputri.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Wahid Supriyadi said Indonesia was trying
to fight terrorism but could not detain people without sufficient proof.
"The police cannot arrest people just based on assumptions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government's stance today is a far cry from the brutal control of
the Suharto years, when many Islamic preachers were locked up for their
militant views.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s and 1990s, Suharto's suppression of dissent prompted
some clerics to flee to Malaysia, planting the seeds of international
terrorism there, authorities say. Among those who received sanctuary were
Hambali and the other clerics: Abu Bakar Bashir, 63; and Mohammed Iqbal
bin Abdul Rahman, 44.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more influential than those three was a fourth cleric,
Abdullah Sungkar, who died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The preachers formed prayer groups in various parts of Malaysia. From
these groups, they recruited the most willing warriors and created small
cells that carried out bank robberies, bombings and a political
assassination, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   The clerics operated below the radar of Malaysia's strict Internal
Security Act and its ubiquitous intelligence agents until two recruits
were killed in a bungled bank robbery last May. One cell member was
captured and began spilling the group's secrets.</TE>
<TE>   One resident of suburban Kuala Lumpur who hosted prayer meetings at
his home told Western reporters that the clerics used the sessions to
attract followers disenchanted with Malaysia's autocratic government. The
clerics, especially Bashir, pushed their listeners to take part in jihad,
or holy war, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir and Sungkar met sometime before 1970. Relatives say they were
inseparable in the early years, often preaching and traveling together.</TE>
<TE>   Sungkar, whose father was from Yemen, was a charismatic speaker and,
if he were alive today, would no doubt be the clerics' main leader, said
Umar Baraja, Bashir's brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Sungkar and Bashir founded the Al-Mukmin school in the city of Solo on
Indonesia's main island of Java in 1972 to promote their vision of an
Islamic state. One graduate of the school, Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, later
linked up with the Jemaah Islamiah network and was arrested last month in
Manila for his alleged role in numerous bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, Sungkar and Bashir went to prison together in Indonesia for
opposing the Suharto government. Both served nearly four years of a
nine-year sentence. In prison, they met Iqbal, a Jakarta native who had
been sentenced on similar charges.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal was the first to move to Malaysia in 1984, and the other two
followed him the next year. Viewing the clerics as refugees from
religious persecution, the Malaysian government gave them residency
permits. They all took Malaysian names: Bashir became Abdus Samad and
Iqbal became Abu Jibril. Abdullah Sungkar became Abdul Halim.</TE>
<TE>   All three lived in the same neighborhood in the state of Negeri
Sembilan until 1986, when Iqbal moved about two hours away to the
secluded Sungai Manggis compound along Manggis River Village Road.
Hambali, whom neighbors and friends knew as a humble and devout traveling
businessman, joined him there in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal's wife, Fatimah Zaharan, described her husband in an interview
as a freelance lecturer who sometimes preached that Muslims had a duty to
defend their religion anywhere it came under threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all from the book," said Zaharan, the mother of nine. "If the
book says it is necessary to have a holy war, then he will teach that. He
never preached a word outside the holy Koran."</TE>
<TE>   When he preached, Hambali, who claims to have met Bin Laden several
times, would urge his followers to go to Indonesia's Molucca Islands to
fight Christians or to Afghanistan to support the Taliban, said one who
attended.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, after Suharto had been ousted as president, Bashir
and Sungkar returned to Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. Two days after
arriving, Sungkar suffered a heart attack and died. Bashir assumed his
role as spiritual leader.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bashir is wanted in Malaysia, where authorities say he provided
his followers with the ideological rationale for engaging in jihad. In
Indonesia, he recently proclaimed Bin Laden to be a "true Muslim fighter"
and told one interviewer that the Sept. 11 attacks were the result of a
Jewish conspiracy carried out with the help of former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police questioned him for two days last month before
releasing him.</TE>
<TE>   Iqbal was arrested in June by Malaysian intelligence police while
preaching to students in a distant village. He was detained in the first
wave of arrests targeting Islamic militants after the May bank heist. His
wife flatly denies charges that Iqbal is connected to any terrorist
plots.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali left Malaysia at the end of 2000, shortly before simultaneous
bomb blasts struck two dozen churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve,
killing 19 and injuring 100. Witnesses implicated him in one of the
bombings, and Indonesian police issued a warrant for his arrest a year
ago. He is also wanted by Malaysia and Singapore for his alleged role in
terrorist operations, including the Singapore bomb plot.</TE>

against Iraq and other rogue nations to fight terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney, speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations, said Iraq is
"very much of concern" to President Bush and is one of the focuses of the
U.S. war against terrorism because of its drive to develop weapons of
mass destruction and its past support of terrorists.</LD>

<HD>Agents Deny Mistreating Student in Terror Probe</HD>
<DH>Investigation: At issue is whether the Jordanian's testimony can be
used against him in his perjury case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Federal agents testified Friday that a Jordanian student cooperated
with authorities voluntarily and was not mistreated before being held as
a material witness in the investigation of the terrorist attacks on the
Pentagon and the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   Osama Awadallah, 21, was later charged with perjury after he denied
knowing one of the suspected hijackers of the airliner that crashed into
the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ordered the hearing in federal
court in Manhattan to determine whether there was merit to Awadallah's
allegations that he was unlawfully arrested and searched, denied access
to his lawyer and abused by officers while in prison.</LD>
<TE>   In an 83-page opinion issued in January ordering the hearing, the
judge raised the possibility that Awadallah's grand jury testimony may
have had an "illegitimate purpose" and may have been conducted under
harsh conditions while the defendant was shackled to a chair.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this occurred while Awadallah was held as a material
witness--not as a defendant accused of criminal conduct," Scheindlin
stressed.</TE>
<TE>   "In sum, whether Awadallah's allegations are true and whether the
resulting grand jury testimony may now be used against him is a question
that must be considered," she concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, seeking to convince the judge that nothing improper
occurred, called as witnesses many of the FBI agents who first had
contact with Awadallah, a computer sciences student at Grossmont College
in El Cajon, Calif., when he came to the attention of authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah's phone number was found in the glove compartment of a car
used by Nawaf Alhazmi, who authorities say was aboard the plane that
struck the Pentagon. The car was later found abandoned in the parking lot
of a Washington-area airport.</TE>
<TE>   Aurelia Alston, the FBI agent who headed the team of investigators
that went to Awadallah's apartment, said she was questioning one of his
roommates when Awadallah was brought into the apartment after being
intercepted in the parking lot outside.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Rielly, another FBI agent, said he started to question Awadallah
in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a cooperative meeting. He was prepared to answer questions,"
Rielly said.</TE>
<TE>   Rielly said Awadallah signed forms consenting to a search of his
apartment and the car he was driving when he entered the parking lot. He
said Awadallah voluntarily agreed to travel to the San Diego field office
for further questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "I informed Mr. Awadallah he was not under arrest," Rielly testified,
adding that the trip to the field office was cordial and they talked
about the significance of the prayer service that had just taken place in
the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   At the FBI field office, Awadallah revoked the permission he gave for
the search of one of the two cars he owned, stating he didn't fully
understand his rights. Rielly said the search of that car was halted.</TE>
<TE>   Teofilo Weston, a San Diego detective who accompanied the FBI agents
to the apartment, told the court that Awadallah gave him his e-mail
address when he requested it while they sat on a couch in the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The picture of Awadallah that emerged during the testimony of the
investigators was of a person cooperating with authorities who acted
friendly--a portrait Jesse Berman, one of Awadallah's lawyers, sought to
refute.</TE>
<TE>   Berman sought to characterize the agents as polite but firmly guiding
Awadallah down the path to an interrogation room even though he was not
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   He was held as a material witnesses the next day and later brought to
New York, where he testified before a grand jury Oct. 15. Awadallah was
indicted on charges of lying to the grand jury when he claimed he didn't
know Khalid Almihdhar, another suspected hijacker, who lived with Alhazmi
in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Awadallah did tell the grand jury that he knew Alhazmi and saw him as
many as 40 times in the vicinity of San Diego from about April 2000 until
December of that year. He identified Alhazmi from a series of
photographs.</TE>
<TE>   In her opinion setting the stage for the hearing, Scheindlin said a
key question is whether the FBI agents improperly arrested Awadallah. She
noted that he appeared "neither recalcitrant nor reluctant" when he went
before the grand jury and said he could have been the subject of a
"perjury trap."</TE>

<HD>Schoolyard Bullies See Life From Behind Bars</HD>
<DH>Discipline: A Minnesota county's hard-line policy is controversial.
Evidence of its effectiveness remains to be seen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HASTINGS, Minn.
</DL>
<LD>Prosecutor James C. Backstrom slides an edge of steel into his
voice and lays out one of the toughest juvenile justice policies in the
nation: School bullies will go to jail.</LD>
<LD>   Beat up another kid, intimidate, harass, pick a fight on the
playground or the bus, "and you will be looking at a minimum of one night
in detention," he says. "Too many kids in this country do not go to
school every day because they're scared of bullies. That is unacceptable.
We're not going to accept it here."</LD>
<LD>   Bullies may find themselves sentenced to community service as well,
forced to clean up a park or scrub the windows of their school. They may
have to pen an apology to their victims. They may be required to attend
counseling. But Backstrom wants those who are at least 13 years old to
hear a cell door click behind them. To spend at least part of a weekend
locked up, alone and--he hopes--remorseful.</LD>
<TE>   "It can be a real clear wake-up call for offenders who think bullying
is a big joke," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Gruenes, a longtime elementary school principal in nearby
Apple Valley, backs him all the way: "As a society, we are guided by
rules. And the earlier a child learns there are consequences, the better
off he is," she argues. "That's what life is about."</TE>
<TE>   The jail-for-bullies policy has been in effect since last spring here
in Dakota County, a fast-growing swath of suburbia marching south from
the Twin Cities. In theory, all six juvenile court judges are on board.
But implementation has been spotty because each judge can define bullying
for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges have been quick to put any kid who lashes out in jail.
Others find reasons to excuse schoolyard fights--the kid was provoked,
he's under stress, he forgot his medication--and hand down more
traditional sentences of community service or counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Public defenders can work the system to get the less punitive judges.
And they are skilled in making the case that the mission of juvenile
court is to rehabilitate, not punish. "In some [bullying] cases, [jail]
is probably appropriate," says Tricia Rettler, the chief defense attorney
for juvenile court. "I just don't know if it cures the kid."</TE>
<TE>   Precise numbers are tough to come by, because the county does not
track bullying cases separately from other juvenile assaults. Prosecutors
estimate that about a dozen bullies have done time behind bars since the
program began. That works out to one jail sentence for every six or seven
school-fight cases to reach the court.</TE>
<TE>   And that's enough to stir considerable controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion that bullying may have been a factor in several
high-profile school shootings has raised sensitivities among educators
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   No one wants to write off taunting and fighting as an inevitable part
of school life. Several states, including Oregon and Michigan, require
school districts to develop anti-bullying policies; Nebraska and
Washington are considering such measures this month. California has a new
law that requires school districts to institute bullying prevention
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet putting teenagers in jail for behavior that one principal here
described as "part of the middle school personality" strikes some as
extreme.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me there are deeper issues that many bullies have, and
I'm not sure a night in jail is going to change them," said Mary
Montaigne, a Dakota County Public Health Department supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Middle school teacher Kristina Clark raises a less philosophical
objection. Her concern is practical: Only physical assaults or serious
threats end up before the court. That leaves out the verbal bullying that
she finds far more common--and every bit as dangerous. "It's a daily
picking, relentless little comments making fun of someone's clothes or
hair, calling someone [names]." In her school, some students fall prey to
such bullying all day. "It's horrible," Clark says.</TE>
<TE>   It's also pervasive. A study released this month by the National Crime
Prevention Council found that 42% of teens see at least one bullying or
taunting incident in school every day. An additional 26% see such
episodes once a week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that every day 160,000
students miss school because they fear harassment by bullies. That
statistic rings true for Backstrom: His own daughter, now 13, was
subjected to such merciless teasing last year that at times she was
reluctant to go to school.</TE>
<TE>   Much-publicized research from Norway, meanwhile, suggests that school
bullies are significantly more likely than their peers to commit crimes
as adults.</TE>
<TE>   Motivated by the statistics and his daughter's experience, Backstrom
worked with county judges last year to develop the tough-line policy.
Before it was implemented, most bullies were referred to a Peer Court,
with high schoolers serving as jurors under a judge's supervision.
Typical sentences there included mandatory essays, early curfews or
letters of apology. Backstrom, however, wanted more.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to identify the behavior early, before it escalates,"
Backstrom says. "We need to try to put a stop to it."</TE>
<TE>   Dakota County already was coming down tough on other juvenile
offenders. There is a curfew for all kids every night of the week,
varying by age. (The penalty is $55 for the first violation and goes up
from there.) And teens who so much as attempt to purchase alcohol may
have their driver's license confiscated. Backstrom recently started
designating all crimes on school campuses as priority cases; his
prosecutors must file charges within 36 hours of any incident, compared
with the month it used to take. His office also has started urging
incarceration for any students who tussle with their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Jailing bullies seemed a logical next step.</TE>
<TE>   Which is how Brad Krueger ended up in court last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Krueger, a high school senior, does not consider himself a bully. Yes,
he and his friends jumped a kid last year on the front steps of Lakeville
High. Yes, they beat him so severely that he had to go to the hospital.
But the way Krueger tells it, the lopsided fight was justified: "He was
mouthing off. We ended it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were not so understanding. They hauled Krueger into
juvenile court on disorderly conduct charges. The judge took one look at
the facts--several brawny buddies pounding a lone victim bloody--and
pronounced Krueger ripe for a night or two in jail.</TE>
<TE>   "It was outrageous," Krueger says.</TE>
<TE>   His public defender thought so too, and advised Krueger to plead not
guilty. When the pretrial hearing rolled around a few weeks later, a
different judge was on the juvenile bench. This one was less eager to put
bullies behind bars. Instead, he sentenced Krueger to apologize to his
victim and to put in 25 hours of community service, which turned out to
involve scrubbing every window of the school and shampooing all the
carpets.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a lot of punishment for a whole two punches I got
in," Krueger grumbles. Sobered by the threat of jail, however, he vowed
to stay out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   So when another kid talked trash to him last month, Krueger reminded
himself not to throw punches. "I wasn't going to go to jail," he says.
Trouble was, he wasn't going to walk away, either--so he grabbed his
tormentor by the throat and held on tight. Once again, it was an uneven
fight. The victim was much smaller. And Krueger found himself charged
with fifth-degree assault.</TE>
<TE>   But he had turned 18 just a few weeks before that fight and was no
longer subject to juvenile court. Instead of facing detention, he wound
up with a $240 fine. He's looking for a job to help pay that debt. And
he's vowing, again, to stay clean.</TE>
<TE>   He insists at first, with a swagger, that his renewed effort to
maintain self-control has nothing to do with his brushes with the law. "I
wouldn't say this has taught me a lesson," he scoffs. "I'm not going to
get in any more fights, but it's not because I'm afraid I'm going to get
into trouble." Then he stops. "Well, maybe it is."</TE>
<TE>   That's the theory behind the Dakota County program. Even if most
bullies manage to avoid incarceration, the hope is that by dangling a
very public threat of jail time, the court will scare aggressors
straight.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave notice to the public [about this new policy], and it's our
hope that the notice itself will be a deterrent," says Judge Richard
Spicer, who chairs the county's juvenile court. He has heard no
complaints so far from parents of teenagers who have been incarcerated.
Nor has he heard any glowing stories of bullies who emerge from a night
in jail transformed.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it working? I don't know," he says. "Will it work? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty reflects the novelty of Dakota County's approach.
Several national experts said they didn't know of any similar programs.</TE>
<TE>   The one that perhaps comes closest is in Pueblo, Colo., 110 miles
south of Denver. There, Dist. Atty. Gus Sandstrom has for several years
been sending shoplifters, pot smokers and other juvenile offenders to
jail for a weekend if he deems them at risk of committing other crimes.
The program is not aimed specifically at bullies, but teens convicted of
assailing peers have found themselves locked up.</TE>
<TE>   Sandstrom has not tracked recidivism rates. Yet he's convinced his
"shock treatment" works. "These kids tend to come out thinking, 'That's
not a place I want to be.' "</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, liken the incarceration policy to the "scared
straight" fad of the 1960s and '70s, when at-risk kids took field trips
to prisons to listen to terrifying firsthand accounts of life behind
bars. Most such programs later were abandoned as ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the rationale . . . , but [incarceration] is a fairly
big stick," says Susan Limber, a bullying expert at Clemson University.
"You can get the same payoff with a lot less drastic measures."</TE>

<HD>Utah Businesses Have Faith That Ads Shalt Not Offend</HD>
<DH>Religion: Some sales pitches create a stir and boost revenue with a
few lighthearted jabs at Mormonism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>The early Mormon settlers wouldn't have approved, but times change:</LD>
<LD>   Billboards tout the lifts at a nearby ski area as roomy enough for
four: "Wife, wife, wife, husband."</LD>
<LD>   Ads for a local beer ask drinkers, "Why have just one?"--a question
that's particularly apt for a suddenly famous brew called Polygamy
Porter.</LD>
<TE>   And just blocks from the renowned Mormon Tabernacle, you can sing your
heart out at a new piano bar called the Tavernacle.</TE>
<TE>   Get it?</TE>
<TE>   Taking a gentle jab at the state's predominant denomination is hardly
the marketing tool for everyone in the conservative business community
here. But for a daring few, it draws all the attention of a torrid
embrace at a church picnic.</TE>
<TE>   For Greg Schirf, the brewer who rolled out Polygamy Porter in
November, sales have gone forth and multiplied. Publicity generated by
the refusal of a billboard company to use his ads didn't hurt; according
to Schirf, demand for his microbrew has jumped from 500 cases a month to
more than 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone bananas," said Schirf, who settled in Park City after
drifting there as a hippie carpenter in the early 1970s. "We can barely
keep up with production."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Mormon officials publicly take a good-natured view of
the ribbing. While polygamy still is practiced in pockets of the state,
the church banned it in 1890 so that Utah could gain statehood.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us just chuckle at this and don't take umbrage," said Bruce
L. Olsen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints. "There's no reason to get uptight about these kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>Billboard Company Draws the Line</TE>
<TE>   Even so, state alcohol officials tried to ban religious references in
ads but were rebuffed in court. And a billboard company that Schirf's
Wasatch Brewing Co. had used for years drew the line at posting a
Polygamy Porter ad urging customers to "take some home for the wives."</TE>
<TE>   "There was some underlying speculation that powerful people didn't
want the billboards up with the Olympics coming," Schirf said.</TE>
<TE>   He has relished for years his edgy ads--and the publicity that comes
with them.</TE>
<TE>   "You suffer from a minority complex being in the beer business in
Utah," he said. "You have to be creative."</TE>
<TE>   A brewer since 1986, he merged two years ago with the company that
puts out St. Provo Girl, a spoof of the imported St. Pauli Girl. Ads for
the beer feature a buxom, dirndl-clad blond and play off Mormon culture.
One of them mocks the standard locution used here to avoid swearing: "If
you just said, 'Oh my heck!' this beer probably isn't for you."</TE>
<TE>   "The Mormons loved it," said Schirf, who was raised a Roman Catholic
in Milwaukee. "It was an in-joke."</TE>
<TE>Debating Wisdom of 'Latter-day Suds'</TE>
<TE>   Schirf says he tests his ideas on focus groups and has rejected a few.
His injunction to "baptise your taste buds" made the cut--but even Schirf
ruefully admits that his brainstorm for a beer called "Latter-day Suds"
might be over the top.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he doesn't have much to lose: "If I offend a Mormon
inadvertently, he never bought my beer anyway," Schirf said. "I can't
lose a customer I never had."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the case at the Brighton Ski Resort, a small ski area 25
miles east of here that relies on local business and whatever tourists it
can lure from bigger and glitzier areas like nearby Park City.</TE>
<TE>   To do that, Brighton's billboards have asked visiting skiiers: "This
is Utah. Why be wedded to one resort?"</TE>
<TE>   Brighton even has had some fun with the name of revered Mormon pioneer
Brigham Young: "Bring 'em young!" a billboard exclaimed. "Kids 10 and
under ski free!"</TE>
<TE>   The current three-wives-and-a-husband campaign has generated only a
few complaints, said Randy Doyle, Brighton's manager.</TE>
<TE>   "I've run it past hundreds of church members, and generally everyone
takes it in the humorous light it was intended," said Doyle, a Mormon
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle suggested that such ads even could be positive for the church,
giving leaders a comfortable opportunity to explain the reality of Mormon

referring to the defiant Utah man convicted on federal bigamy charges
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of a new piano bar here called the Tavernacle weren't out

home."</TE>

says.</TE>

<HD>'Soft Money' Ban Seen Surviving High Court Test</HD>
<DH>Politics: In last two years, justices have ruled twice to reject
free-speech claims, upholding limits on funding of campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Not long ago, the drive for campaign funding reform looked as
though it would stall at the steps of the Supreme Court, stopped by the
1st Amendment right of freedom of speech.</LD>
<LD>   But twice in the last two years, the high court has rejected
free-speech claims from party activists and instead upheld strict limits
on the flow of money into the political system.</LD>
<LD>   The court's tilt in favor of campaign finance regulations has
heartened the advocates of reform and convinced them that the "soft
money" ban approved by the House this week will survive the inevitable
legal challenges.</LD>
<TE>   "They've seen the explosive growth of soft money, and they recognize
the problem," Don Simon, general counsel for the citizen lobby group
Common Cause, said of the justices. "A majority of the court has shown
itself to be strongly in favor of rules that deal with the corruption of
politics by big money."</TE>
<TE>   But legal experts believe that a separate restriction on political
advertising could be struck down on free-speech grounds. The House and
Senate bills forbid incorporated groups to broadcast ads that refer to a
"clearly identifiable candidate" near election day.</TE>
<TE>   The bill itself says the provisions are separate and "severable,"
however. If one provision of the law is struck down by the courts, the
other provisions can remain unaffected.</TE>
<TE>   And it is the central, soft-money provision that appears to be backed
by the high court's last two rulings in campaign finance cases. Soft
money refers to the unlimited donations to national political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the court, by a 6-3 vote, revived a $1,000-per-person
limit on contributions to candidates in Missouri. Conservative judges had
thrown out the limits on free-speech grounds, and lawyers for the
Republican National Committee urged the justices to strike down
contribution limits as archaic and unconstitutional. Since the money
funds political ads, it is speech protected by the 1st Amendment, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the high Court said too much money can corrupt the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy works only if the people have faith in those who govern,"
wrote Justice David H. Souter. And that faith can be destroyed if the
public comes to believe that "large donors call the tune."</TE>
<TE>   "Money is property. It is not speech," added Justice John Paul
Stevens. And money, like property, can be regulated by the government,
even if pure speech cannot be, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And last year, the court, on a 5-4 vote, rejected the notion that
political parties have a special free-speech right to raise and spend
campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Colorado Republican Party had asked the court to knock
down all the spending limits for parties. They argued that political
parties are not agents of corruption but are essential players in a
democratic system that values open debate on public issues.</TE>
<TE>   But Souter, speaking for the court, cast aside this idealized image of
the parties as debating societies and focused on "how the power of money
actually works in the political structure."</TE>
<TE>   Parties can be used as "channels for circumventing" the legal limits
on corporations, unions and the wealthy if their money can flow through
the party to the campaigns, he said.</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, is precisely the argument against soft money. In the
late 1970s, the Federal Election Commission opened a supposedly narrow
channel to permit unregulated money to flow into the parties for
so-called party building activities. In theory, these were separate from
an actual election and, therefore, outside the realm of federal election
law.</TE>
<TE>   A decade or so later, party officials realized they could broadcast
"issue ads" that touted their positions and derided the opposition
without running afoul of the federal election laws. The Supreme Court has
said that issue ads were protected as free speech so long as they did not
advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, the channel of unregulated soft money had turned
into a river.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into the 1996 presidential race, Bill Clinton and Sen. Bob
Dole realized they could solicit huge contributions for their parties
from rich donors, corporations and unions. Then they could use that money
to run media campaigns that attacked the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   But Souter later wrote that if this sort of "end run" around the law
is permitted, the federal election laws should be scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Souter's most recent opinion (FEC vs. the Colorado Republican Party)
was joined by Justices Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer
and Sandra Day O'Connor. The four dissenters said campaign spending by
political parties is not a type of corruption and should be protected
under the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation provides for a speedy review in the federal courts.
Challengers could sue before a three-judge panel in Washington, and from
there the case would go directly to the high court.</TE>
<TE>   Some election lawyers say a provision regulating broadcast ads near
election days may not survive a court test.</TE>
<TE>   The bill prohibits the use of corporate or union money, including
funds from nonprofit corporations, for TV and radio spots that "refer to
a clearly identifiable candidate" within 60 days of an election.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents said corporations and unions should not be allowed to run
attack ads before an election. But critics say the provision is so broad
it could bar media spots by advocacy groups.</TE>

<TE>Campaign Finance Overhaul</TE>
<TE>The House approved the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill,
which is nearly identical to the McCain-Feingold bill passed
by the Senate last April. Key backers in the Senate have embraced the
House measure and its wording on the few points where the bills
differ. They promise a rapid floor vote that could send the measure
to President Bush for his signature. The Shays-Meehan bill would:</TE>
<TE>Prohibit "soft money," unlimited contributions by individuals,
unions, corporations and interest groups to the national political
parties.</TE>
<TE>Prohibit state and local party organizations from spending soft
money on federal elections, with the exception of funds collected for
voter turnout and registration.</TE>
<TE>Allow individuals to give up to $2,000 per election to candidates
for president and Congress, up from the current $1,000. The limit
would rise with inflation.</TE>
<TE>Allow individuals to give a total of $95,000 every two years to
candidates and parties, up from $50,000. This limit would also rise
with inflation. (The Senate approved a $75,000 limit, which would be
dropped in favor of the House figure.)</TE>
<TE>Ease contribution limits under certain circumstances for federal
candidates who face self-financed wealthy opponents.</TE>
<TE>Prohibit unions, corporations and interest groups from using their
general funds to pay for broadcast advertising that targets a
"clearly identifiable" federal candidate for 30 days before a primary
election and 60 days before a general election. Ads funded by money
these groups raise under federal campaign contribution rules would be
exempt.</TE>
<TE>Take effect Nov. 6, the day after the 2002 congressional elections.
(The Senate version calls for an earlier effective date.)</TE>

<HD>Boot Camp Chief Held in Boy's Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: A 14-year-old died in July at the Arizona site for troubled
youth. Two other staffers are also arrested.</DH>

<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>The director of a boot camp for troubled youngsters was arrested on
murder and child-abuse charges Friday in the death of a teenage camper
who collapsed in 116-degree heat last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Long II, 56, was also charged with aggravated assault for
allegedly pulling a knife on a camper, and marijuana possession, for a
quarter-pound of the drug found in his bedroom closet.</LD>
<LD>   The second-degree murder charge was filed over the death of
14-year-old Anthony Haynes. He died July 1 while attending a five-week
boot camp operated by the America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-enactors Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The medical examiner's office said Haynes died of complications from
dehydration and near-drowning--dehydration after being made to stand in
the sun for up to five hours, the near-drowning from being left in a
motel bathtub, where he had been taken to cool him off.</TE>
<TE>   Two other boot camp staffers also were arrested Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Camp sergeant Ray Anderson, 39, was charged with child abuse for
allegedly spanking, stomping, beating and whipping more than 14 children.
He was also accused of denying them water or shade in the heat.</TE>
<TE>   A 17-year-old counselor was charged with child abuse and was being
held at a juvenile detention center. The arrests of more camp officials
were expected, said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.</TE>
<TE>   Long plans to plead not guilty at his Feb. 22 arraignment, said his
attorney, David Smith. He was jailed on $100,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's lawyer, David Derickson, said his client also would plead
not guilty at next week's arraignment. Anderson's bail was set at
$10,620.</TE>
<TE>   The camp opened in 2001 and was closed by the sheriff's office July 2
after Haynes died.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the camp's regimen included forced marches, black
uniforms in triple-digit temperatures, harsh discipline and a daily diet
limited to an apple, a carrot and a bowl of beans.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits have been filed by Haynes' parents and a woman who claimed
her son was beaten, forced to eat mud and deprived of sleep.</TE>

<HD>Judge Calls Being Lesbian 'Detestable'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>In awarding custody of three teenagers to their father over their
lesbian mother, the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court wrote
Friday that homosexuality is "an inherent evil" and shouldn't be
tolerated.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-judge panel ruled unanimously in favor of a Birmingham man
and against his ex-wife, who now lives with her partner in Southern
California.</LD>
<LD>   The parents weren't named in court documents to protect the identity
of the children, ages 15, 17 and 18.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Justice Roy Moore wrote that the mother's relationship made her
an unfit parent and that homosexuality is "abhorrent, immoral,
detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Moore also quoted Scripture, historical documents and previous state
court rulings that he said back his view.</TE>
<TE>   Moore is known for his decision to place washing machine-sized
monuments of the Ten Commandments in the state judicial building after he
became chief justice last year. He also fought to keep a Ten Commandments
plaque in his courtroom when he was a district judge.</TE>
<TE>   David White, state coordinator for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of
Alabama, said Moore's opinion reflects outdated thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate Alabama is going to be embarrassed once again by a
religious fanatic in a position of power in Alabama," White said. "It's
obvious he cannot judge a gay person fairly and he should be removed from
office."</TE>
<TE>   John Giles, state president of the Christian Coalition, said Moore's
decision protects the institution of marriage and strengthens the
traditional family.</TE>
<TE>   The father had held custody since 1996, but the mother petitioned for
custody in June 2000, contending the father had been abusive.</TE>
<TE>   John Durward, the father's attorney, said his client "is very
relieved."</TE>
<TE>   The mother's attorney, Wendy Crew, had no immediate comment.</TE>

<HD>Mysterious Rash Plagues Children in 7 States</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of youngsters in at least seven states have broken out in
mysterious rashes, and some health investigators suspect it might be
caused by a new or yet-to-be-identified virus.</LD>
<LD>   The red, itchy rash appears to be more an annoyance than a serious
health threat, but it has managed to temporarily close schools, worry
parents and frustrate school administrators, for whom answers have been
elusive.</LD>
<LD>   Students in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio,
Oregon and Washington state have complained about rashes on the face,
arms, legs and body. For the most part, the rash goes away when the
students leave school.</LD>
<TE>   "For something like this to occur almost simultaneously in different
parts of the country is, to my knowledge, unprecedented," said Dr. Norman
Sykes, who examined 30 suburban Philadelphia students who came down with
the rash this month. Sykes is a dermatologist and professor at Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   In the Quakertown Community School District, where nearly 170 students
at all nine schools were confirmed to have the rash, an environmental
company collected air and water samples and examined carpets, floor mats,
vacuum bags and clothing, but all tested negative for contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   "We may never know what this thing is," said Quakertown Supt. Jim
Scanlon.</TE>
<TE>   Most school systems have ruled out an environmental cause, but not the
Peninsula School District in Gig Harbor, Wash., where more than 50
students and teachers complained about a rash.</TE>
<TE>   Test results showed an abnormally high level of dust, dandruff and
skin particles--probably caused by an overactive ventilation system that
took too much moisture out of the air.</TE>

<HD>Man Dies After N.Y. Hit-and-Run</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A New Jersey man who shot two people and plowed his car into 26
others in a weeklong crime spree could face a murder charge following the
death Friday of one of the hit-and-run victims, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Ronald Popadich, 39, of Garfield, has already been
charged with attempted murder in the Sunday shooting of his neighbor. He
pleaded not guilty Friday to those charges during a brief court
appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say Popadich struck 19 pedestrians Tuesday in Manhattan at
the intersection of 32nd Street and Seventh Avenue. Two days later,
police said, he returned to the city in a stolen car and slammed into
seven more people within sight of Pennsylvania Station and Madison Square
Garden.</LD>
<TE>   A 41-year-old man struck in the first hit-and-run died Friday morning
after undergoing surgery to repair compound leg fractures, said Jasmine
Collazo, a St. Vincent's Hospital spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, Barbara
Thompson, said Friday that prosecutors would present a murder case to a
grand jury following the pedestrian's death.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it had not yet been determined
whether Popadich would be extradited to New York, or if New Jersey would
go ahead with its case first.</TE>
<TE>   Public Defender Melody Merola left Friday's brief court hearing
without commenting to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Popadich, 39, was arrested Thursday at the home he shares with his
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Once in custody, Popadich confessed to both hit-and-runs and the
shooting of neighbor Lisa Gotkin, authorities said. Popadich also said he
shot a cabdriver Wednesday night, two law enforcement officials told
Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>

<HD>Guards Acquitted in Jail Death</HD>

<DL>STARKE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Three prison guards were acquitted Friday on charges they stomped
an inmate to death in his cell to keep him from exposing brutality behind
bars.</LD>
<LD>   The jury deliberated for 3 1/2 hours before returning its verdict in
the murder trial of Capt. Timothy Thornton, 36, and Sgts. J.D. Griffis
and Charles Brown, both 28.</LD>
<LD>   The former Florida State Prison officers hugged their attorneys after
the verdicts were read.</LD>
<TE>   All were charged with second-degree murder in the July 17, 1999,
slaying of inmate Frank Valdes, 36, who was found dead after what
prosecutors allege were two violent confrontations with guards.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes had received broken ribs and other fractures and internal
injuries, and his upper body was covered with boot prints. Prosecutors
said he was beaten to keep him from talking to reporters about
mistreatment of inmates.</TE>
<TE>   The guards were also accused of conspiracy to commit aggravated
battery, battery on an inmate and official misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys had argued that some of Valdes' injuries were caused
by his climbing the bars in his cell and throwing himself onto the floor
and his bunk.</TE>
<TE>   Before deliberating, the jurors were shown photos of inmates who had
testified against the guards.</TE>
<TE>   "There is your reasonable doubt," defense attorney Gloria Fletcher
said during closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   But two medical examiners determined Valdes was stomped to death.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get this many rib fractures, you can't breathe," Dr. Ronald
Wright, a former South Florida medical examiner, testified.</TE>
<TE>   "The murderers are here," McMahon said.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes was imprisoned for the 1987 murder of Fred Griffis, 40. He was
not related to defendant Jason Griffis.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Griffis, a corrections officer at Glades Correctional
Institution, was shot to death when Valdes and another man attempted to
free an inmate in a prison van outside a West Palm Beach doctor's office.</TE>

<LD>Also, a story in Wednesday's Calendar about the year's biggest
Oscar nomination surprises stated that "Moulin Rouge" was "shut out" of
the musical categories. In fact, the film is not eligible in the original
song or original score categories because neither a song nor "Moulin
Rouge's" score was initially created for the film.</LD>
