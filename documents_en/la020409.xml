<LD>For author E. Annie Proulx, who has lived happily in a big log house
on 190 wind-swept acres in Wyoming for the last seven years, visits
to Los Angeles are a vivid contrast to life in the state she's
personified in her work. In conversation, and in her writing, she
speaks of Wyoming with the tenderness of an old friend. "It's an
extremely handsome place," she said by phone from her home last week.
"Quiet. Peaceful. Windy."</LD>
<LD>   "The country poured open on each side ... the empty pale place and
its roaring wind ... the distant antelope as tiny as mice," she
writes in her 1999 book "From Close Range: Wyoming Stories"
(Scribner).</LD>
<LD>   "Then the violent country showed itself, the cliffs rearing at the
moon, the snow smoking off the prairie like steam, the white flank of
the ranch slashed with fence cuts, the sagebrush glittering and along
the creek black tangles of willow bunched like dead hair."</LD>
<TE>   It's a world away from the Hollywood swirl she entered when "The
Shipping News," her 1993 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, became a film.
Promotional work for the movie brought her to Beverly Hills for a few
days in December, and, at one point during her trip, Proulx found
herself racing around town to high-priced shoe stores looking for a
suitable pair to wear to the film's Hollywood premiere.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very different experience for me, because the stores I
shop in are not purveyors of Manolo Blahniks," said the 66-year-old
writer.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, she wore a pair of shoes she'd brought from home.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another odd point in the trip took place during her talks with
reporters. "I discovered that interviewers were bitterly disappointed
that I liked [the film]," she said. "There is kind of a tradition, if
you're a writer, that you're supposed to hate what is done to [the
novel with] the film. I found myself in the extremely weird position
of saying: 'No. I really liked it.' It was quite silly."</TE>
<TE>   The world of literature, not film, will draw Proulx back to Los
Angeles on April 25, a second trip in four months and a rarity, she
said, since "I usually get there once every few years." Proulx will
be in town to speak at UCLA with Jack Miles, author of the
Pulitzer-winning "God: A Biography" (Knopf, 1995). (Her appearance is
part of the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books.)</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, she finished a new book titled "That Old Ace in the
Hole," which is set in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and due
out early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "In part, it's connected with my study of the exploration of the
West," she said. "In the course of travels of 20 years I've
crisscrossed that part of the country frequently and I rather liked
it.... Most people find it unpleasant ... [but] it occurred to me
that a place that has so many things not going for it would be a good
place to write about."</TE>

<TE>   Is Stallone's Mom Following His Lead?</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester Stallone's mother, Jacqueline, is gunning for a matchup
on the new Fox TV series "Celebrity Boxing." In March, producers of
the new program pitted Paula Jones against Tonya Harding. Network
sources told The Times last week that the next pairing could be Joey
Buttafuoco and John Wayne Bobbitt.</TE>
<TE>   Jacqueline Stallone, an astrologer who's in her 70s, says she's
calling some of her celebrity peers to pitch a matchup. Her top
picks, she says, are Cher's mother, Georgia Holt, Tammy Faye Bakker
and Zsa Zsa Gabor. If they're not interested, she says: "What I'd
like to do is go a round with my lawyer and knock him out....We can
get Phyllis Diller and Liz Taylor. Let people take bets on who's
going to win. The winner always gets a chance to slug another
celebrity. You'd be surprised. Everyone has a secret desire to sock
someone on the nose."</TE>

<TE>   'Cold Mountain' Author Scores Big</TE>
<TE>   Author Charles Frazier reportedly received an $8-million advance
for his next book, after submitting a one-page proposal, according to
the BBC and Newsweek. After a bidding war, Random House won the
rights for the as-yet-untitled book. Producer Scott Rudin secured the
movie rights for more than $3 million. Like Frazier's previous novel,
the bestselling "Cold Mountain," it's set during the Civil War.</TE>

<LD>SONG OF THE WATER SAINTS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Nelly Rosario</LD>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   256 pages; $23</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Edwidge Danticat has sketched Haitian life and Junot Diaz has
limned the experience of Dominican Americans, Nelly Rosario writes of
the pastoral West Indies slamming up against American apple pie with
"Song of the Water Saints," a first novel depicting intractable
Dominican women.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1916 Santo Domingo, the tale follows a family's women
over four generations: willful Graciela, whose hunger for another
life is her downfall; Graciela's daughter Mercedes, pious, the
opposite of her mother, yet whose strong will is equally evident; and
Leila, Mercedes' granddaughter, whose modern-day New York existence
caps the narrative.</TE>
<TE>   The novel begins with a scene that haunts the reader: The
poverty-stricken Dominican Republic is under cruel "yanqui"
occupation when Graciela and her 15-year-old boyfriend Silvio are
seen embracing, "lost in their tangle of tongues," by a yanqui
photographer. Specializing in postcard art of piquant
scenes--"brothel quad- roons bathed in feathers, a Negro chambermaid
naked to the waist"--the photographer pays Graciela and Silvio a
handful of pesos to pose in a risque manner for his black box.</TE>
<TE>   For much of her restless life, Graciela views this moment as
portentous. Did the photographer somehow steal her soul and that of
her lover? Had he cast a spell over them with his box?</TE>
<TE>   Because the resulting postcard is described on the novel's first
page, cataloged in Hamburg, Germany, as part of the Peter J. West
collection, the reader wonders the same thing. A certain weight is
given to the photograph by its prominent placement, and we read on,
waiting for clarification of that significance.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when Graciela meets Eli Cavalier, a German vegetarian who
has amassed a collection of West's postcards, we think the moment of
revelation is at hand. But rather than disclose what happened to the
photo, Eli rubs Graciela's skin with dried lavender--"What is this
for?" Graciela asks him. "Seasoning for my meal," Eli
replies--leaving the reader to wonder what became of the postcard.
Like Graciela's fleeting luck and the overwhelming passions that
buffet her, a copy of the postcard is never within her grasp.</TE>
<TE>   The book's strongest moments involve Graciela. For example, her
second husband Casimiro wants to give her what she desires--a glimpse
of the world beyond her own. Travel between countries is dangerous,
so he arranges an excursion down river to visit friends who used to
live in Puerto Rico. The friends' accents are convincingly foreign,
allowing Casimiro to persuade Graciela he's taken her to Puerto Rico.
The poignant scene resonates throughout the novel.</TE>
<TE>   Graciela is gullible at first, thrilled by the spectacle of the
larger world, but soon figures out his ploy. The wife of the family
they visit counsels Graciela, when she realizes the duping, that it's
best to play dumb. Graciela does so to preserve what Casimiro has
tried to give her.</TE>
<TE>   In this, one of the few moments in which Graciela is not grasping
for something beyond herself, we're given a glimpse of the contented
life she might have had, had she been able to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   But such is not to be her life. Graciela is characterized
throughout as a woman who can't get enough, whose restlessness causes
her to abandon her daughter, to leave her dedicated husband and to
search in vain for a vision of life she cannot even name.</TE>
<TE>   "Too much passion and curiosity for her own good, Mai and Pai
always told her," we learn of Graciela early in the book, and she
stays true to this portrait.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Graciela's daughter Mercedes raises herself and directs
her own restlessness toward an ability to manipulate numbers.
Mercedes becomes a business success, accomplishing in her own life
one of Graciela's greatest unmet desires--a turquoise, palm wood
house with a zinc roof. Yet, as with her mother, it's not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Together with her husband, her son and her granddaughter Leila,
Mercedes moves to New York for a better life, leaving behind Leila's
mother (her own daughter) who cannot extricate herself from Dominican
life.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes is wide-eyed upon arriving in New York--"jackpot video
games and the Puerto Rican lottery at the bodega, a chute in the
hallway that swallows up the garbage, little black discs that
magically destroy roaches"--while granddaughter Leila's adaptation to
the United States is predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Though her grandparents wish her to be chaste and pious, she's as
damned by her desire as her great-grandmother was, with unrelenting
fate playing a leading role.</TE>
<TE>   Author Rosario does an excellent job conjuring colorful, vibrant
scenes of Caribbean life. Those vivid scenes, though, never cohere as
a whole. The stories, even the most compelling ones of Graciela, do
not add up to a fully imagined narrative arc. Like the postcard from
the first page, many of the seemingly portentous moments remain
unclear in their significance. Still, Rosario succeeds in giving us
that for which Graciela so hungered: passage into a world beyond our
own horizon.</TE>

<HD>A Curious Monkey's Climb to Success</HD>
<DH>An exhibition of artwork honors George's creators and the
playful simian's six decades in print.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something delightfully simian about so many humans. Yet it is
unacceptable to eyeball Uncle Lou or Baby Bob or one's spouse and
comment: "You look like a monkey to me." Egos would be bruised. If,
however, a particular monkey is specified--Curious George--the remark
might be taken as endearment.</LD>
<LD>   For the past 60 years, Curious George has been the cutest,
sweetest, most inquisitive and adventurous primate in children's
literature. Notice, we did not say smart. George has been known to
open an apothecary jar, ignore the label that reads "ether" and
inhale deeply. His anesthesia was immediate and total.</LD>
<LD>   And when he came to, he had learned a good lesson about messing
with items he'd been told not to touch, no matter how curious a
monkey he might be.</LD>
<TE>   Almost every parent can relate to a tale like that, which is one
reason why more than 25 million Curious George books have been sold
in 14 languages. And now, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of
Curious George's birth, the Los Angeles Public Library has an exhibit
of original artwork and memorabilia from the lives of his creators.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Augusto Rey (born 1898) and Margret Elizabeth Waldstein (born
1906) were natives of Hamburg, Germany. They met briefly there, but
no sparks flew. Each fled, independently, to Rio de Janeiro to escape
the worsening political climate in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Margret had trained as an artist. Hans loved animals and drawing
but was selling bathtubs when the couple met again in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   They married in 1935, honeymooned in Paris, and liked it so much
that they moved there. Hans abandoned tubs to be a newspaper
cartoonist, and his lovable animals led a publisher to request that
he do a children's book.</TE>
<TE>   "Raffy and the Nine Monkeys" was the debut appearance of a
mischievous little monkey named George, who was not yet a star
attraction. The couple decided he needed a book of his own and began
together to create one. Before it could be published, they had to
flee again.</TE>
<TE>   Nazi troops entered Paris four hours after they had pedaled away
on a pair of Hans' homemade bikes. They carried nothing with them
except five manuscripts, one of which was about Curious George.</TE>
<TE>   When the couple finally landed in New York, which became their
permanent home, they began life anew as partner artists and
authors--and parents of the fictional monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Curious George" was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1941 and
hasn't been out of print since. Over the years, the Reys dabbled
separately and together in other artistic and literary projects, some
of which are also on display at the library. But George was, as
Margret used to say, "the family breadwinner."</TE>
<TE>   As such, he held the place of honor in their lives. The delicate
original sketches and preliminary drawings of George at his impish
exploits reveal a tenderness impossible to convey on a commercially
printed page. And then there are the words, laboriously printed in
pencil by the Reys, sometimes crossed out, with comments in the
margins.</TE>
<TE>   Wandering through the small exhibit, which includes some of the
Reys' homemade greeting cards, is a little bit like attending a
birth. George's lineage becomes clear: He came from a good and loving
home.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Rey died in 1977, Margret in 1996. George survives in print
and through the Curious George Foundation, established in 1989 to
fund programs that assist children and animals.</TE>

<LD>Nancy Sanchez, 18, is a senior at Leuzinger High in Lawndale. A
gifted singer, she is one of 1,200 students participating this Friday
in the Los Angeles Master Chorale's 13th Annual High School Choir
Festival. Sanchez, who is president of her school's chorale club and
works part-time as a secretary, talks about the power of music,
having faith in herself and moving forward.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   This will be my fourth year participating in the Master Chorale's
festival. It's amazing to hear so many voices sing together; it's
really beautiful. Grant Gershon, who is conducting the festival, is
so patient. He shows us his love for the music, which is very
inspiring. I love classical music; it's so calm and relaxing.</LD>
<TE>   I'm the only girl in a family of five kids, and I'm the only one
who sings. A friend of mine talked me into taking a choir class in
junior high, and I've been singing ever since. I've been lucky enough
to have the same teacher, J. Clayton Wright, the entire time. He's
taught me how emotional music can be. He's also helped me learn to
have faith in myself.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't always a good student. I used to skip school. This is
actually my fifth year in high school. But one day a couple of years
ago I woke up and thought, who's going to be there for me when my
parents aren't? I knew that I had to become responsible. I decided
right then to go back to school and work hard. No one pushed me. I
did it all on my own, which is really a good feeling. I'm graduating
this spring and hope to get a scholarship to El Camino College and
move forward. I'd like to be a registered nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuing music has been a great experience. It makes me feel like
I'm worth so much. We all have a gift in us; we just have to bring it
out.</TE>

<HD>Just a Whisper on the FM Dial</HD>
<DH>KPFZ takes to the airwaves as if its broadcasts reached
beyond a few miles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LUCERNE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The transmitter is on a shelf in Andy Weiss' laundry room. The
antenna is attached to the branch of an oak tree behind his house.
His personal telephone line? It's the same one he uses to take calls
for KPFZ-LP, the 100-watt radio station broadcasting from his home in
Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   It's just a few minutes after 6 p.m. Saturday, the one day each
week the station is live, and DJs Lonnie "Elmo" Moultry, 51, and Tee
Watts, 51, are on the air spinning vinyl. During their two-hour show,
"In the Free Zone," they mix it up with everything from the Rolling
Stones and Pink Floyd to the Supremes and Temptations--not unusual
music, just an unusual format, which is whatever they want to play.
Their music show, one of several the station hosts, follows a string
of public affairs programs: "The Environment Hour," "I'm Not a
Lawyer, but I Play One on the Radio" and "Artwatch."</LD>
<LD>   No one knows how many people are listening. Anyone who is, though,
is within 15 miles of Weiss' house. KPFZ is a low-power FM radio
station, or LPFM. It is one of only two stations to get up and
running in California since the FCC approved this new class of
license two years ago. The other is KEFC, operated by the Evangelical
Free Church of Turlock, which airs Christian music and religious
services.</LD>
<TE>   The new licenses were created to bring localized radio programming
to small communities and to diversify the content of what's
broadcast. Last year, the FCC began issuing the first of about 240
construction permits for LPFMs to schools, churches, Indian
reservations, community organizations and other noncommercial
special-interest groups across the nation--21 of them in California.</TE>
<TE>   Run by the nonprofit Lake County Community Radio group, KPFZ has
been on the air since September. It's among a few to be operated out
of a house. Nationally, only about a dozen LPFMs have managed to get
on the air since the FCC made the licenses available. Duct-taped to
the chain-link gate on Weiss' driveway is a ragged piece of cardboard
with magic marker lettering that reads, "KPFZ 104.5." There's no
gargantuan radio tower, no flashy sign to give the station away. Just
a humble three-bedroom house on a hill overlooking Lucerne, the
"Switzerland of America," according to its welcome sign. A lazy lake
community supported by agriculture and tourism, Lucerne, population
2,000, is one of several small towns that ring Clear Lake, the
state's largest natural inland body of water. On any given day, boats
dot its surface, and motorcycles cruise its 100 miles of shoreline.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On-Air Legal Advice</TE>
<TE>   On Saturdays, beginning at 7 a.m., a steady stream of DJs travel
the dirt road to Weiss' home. They will host talk shows on topics
ranging from the environment to local politics and music programs
featuring folk and jazz, and they are carting records, interview
materials, food and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine and Steve Elias, a husband-and-wife team, are at the
station to host a legal talk show called "Both Sides Now." It runs
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Neither Catherine, 62, nor Steve, 60, had
been at the controls of a radio station before a friend told them
about KPFZ, but, united in their belief that radio should be used as
a tool to inform and educate, they got involved last summer.
Catherine, a former paralegal trainer, is now KPFZ's president; her
co-host husband is a retired attorney.</TE>
<TE>   KPFZ's left leanings are evidenced in the DJ studio, a room Weiss
once used as his office, where local maps and stickers supporting the
Green Party and Ralph Nader give the small space a cozy,
crunchy-granola feel. The DJ console is a hodgepodge of turntables,
tape decks, CD players and other studio gear.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss decided to get involved in the grass-roots business of
creating an LPFM station because he believes that it is important to
have local voices on the airwaves and that those airwaves be
accessible to voices outside the "mono-culture" of mainstream media.</TE>
<TE>   KPFZ broadcasts live only one day of the week to limit the
disturbance to Weiss' personal life--his regular job is as a
community college computer instructor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great most of the time, but sometimes it's not," said Weiss,
55, who re-broadcasts Saturday's shows and prerecorded programs from
other sources during the rest of the week. "When you're in the mood
to make radio, which is most of the time, it's terrific. But if
you're not, then ... it's like having a party when you don't want
one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of Local Interest</TE>
<TE>   Like many people who live in small communities far removed from
major metropolitan areas, the people of Lucerne are too far away to
be able to tune in to most of the radio stations broadcasting from
the Bay Area (three hours south) or Sacramento (two hours southeast).
Even so, only a portion of what is broadcast on those stations is
directly relevant to their lives. Much of it is not.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to know what the [local] board of supervisors is
doing," Catherine Elias said. "They need a traffic report. They need
to know if there's a five-car pileup on Todd Road so they can drive
down Main Street. A lot of community groups are offering services,
but no one knows they're around.... There's all kinds of levels of
needs that could be broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   Except for KPFZ, Lake County does not have a noncommercial station
to broadcast in-depth or detailed community news. A commercial
station in Lakeport, the county seat, airs headline news once an
hour. In what is becoming standard industry practice, programming
that originates on a single station is simulcast over a number of
channels in different markets for cost efficiency. Local news is a
casualty, as is esoteric programming, which is bumped off the air in
favor of more profitable and proven formats, such as rock and
hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   Until the Telecommunications Act of 1996, broadcasters were
allowed to own no more than four stations in a single market and 40
nationwide. Today they are allowed to own up to eight in a single
market with no overall cap. Infinity Broadcasting Corp., based in New
York, and Clear Channel Communications, in Texas, are the country's
largest radio broadcasters. Today, Infinity owns 186 stations, most
of them in major markets. Clear Channel owns 1,165 stations in 45 of
the top 50 markets.</TE>
<TE>   Though the economies-of-scale simulcast strategy "makes sense as a
business model, it doesn't make sense as a medium," said Hub Brown,
who teaches broadcast journalism and ethics at Syracuse University in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   And though Brown wants to see that diverse voices have access to
the airways, he is not a fan of low-power radio--not because of its
content, but because he thinks it has a quality of tokenism. "It puts
a lot of legitimate community interest into this sort of ghetto on
the radio dial. The stations don't have very much reach and therefore
can't command large sections of a community to get them to focus on
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Fostering local ownership and diversity is part of the reason the
FCC approved LPFM licenses. "There was a real grass-roots movement
for people to be able to create their own small radio stations ...
and the administration at the time was interested in providing them
an avenue that really wasn't available to them,'' said an FCC
spokesman. A similar type of license called a Class D used to be
available, but the FCC stopped issuing them in 1978, and only a few
still exist.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC began considering LPFM in 1998, but it wasn't until
January, 2000, that it was approved, after one of the most
contentious FCC battles of the last decade. The National Assn. of
Broadcasters, a Washington, D.C., trade group that "promotes and
protects the interests of radio and TV broadcasters," according to
its Web site, lobbied against low-power radio saying it would
interfere with existing stations.</TE>
<TE>   While the NAB was not successful in keeping LPFMs off the air
entirely, it did succeed in lowering the number that could be
licensed. When the FCC first approved LPFM, it estimated that more
than 1,000 licenses would be approved. More than 3,000 LPFM
applications were submitted, but the FCC granted a little more than
200.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't sit well with people such as Pete Tridish, 32,
founder of the Prometheus Radio Project, a Philadelphia group working
to "incite people to radio" and to help low-power stations get on
air. "There are so many more that should have gotten licenses," he
said. "So many more people in the more urban areas."</TE>
<TE>   There are no LPFM stations in cities. The licenses are only
available in places where there are so-called "third adjacencies" on
the FM dial. Which means stations that are 800 megahertz away from
each other. A station can operate at 91.1, for example, only if there
are no stations closer than either 91.9 or 89.3. Though that
situation exists in less populous places, it does not in metropolitan
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's most definitely more room for these things out there,"
the FCC spokesman said, though the agency has no plans to expand its
LPFM program at this time. "The question is, 'Is there room at the
same location where there's interest?' As with a lot of these things,
the more interest is where the more population is, and where there's
more population there's a higher likelihood of there being more
full-service stations in existence that would prevent the creation of
low-power stations."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Limited Reach</TE>
<TE>   At KPFZ, even with a transmitter that puts out 100 watts and a
well-placed antenna, the signal does not travel far enough to reach
all of the Lake County area's 55,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   The station has applied for a full-power, 500-watt license but is
waiting to hear from the FCC. The LPFM licenses are either 10- or
100-watt, enough power to reach between 1 and 3.5 miles, according to
FCC estimates, though signals may travel farther. By comparison, many
full-service FM stations have licenses allowing them to operate at
50,000 to 100,000 watts--enough power to reach, in some cases, up to
or beyond 100 miles.</TE>
<TE>   California was one of the first states in the country to receive
LPFM construction permits--all of them granted between April and June
2001. The groups that received them were given 18 months to get on
air from the time they received notice they were approved. Nearly a
year has passed, but KPFZ is the only California LPFM to get up and
running. Most of the rest are experiencing difficulties, from
insufficient funding and staff to a lack of broadcast know-how.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a small church. We don't have a lot of money. We're looking
for the best deals we can get," said Calvin Palmer, pastor of Calvary
Chapel of North Edwards--one of five branches of the same church in
California that were granted LPFMs. "We're doing the best we can with
what little we have."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who intends to use the radio station to broadcast Sunday
services and community news, estimates it will cost $15,000 just to
buy the basic equipment to run the station.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC does not charge a fee for LPFM licenses, as it does with
other classes of radio license. The greatest cost for LPFMs is the
infrastructure--transmitter, antenna, studio gear. Depending on the
equipment, it can cost thousands of dollars. Operating the station is
significantly less expensive--in many cases, just the cost of
electricity to run the studio. For KPFZ, that's about $100 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Run more on enthusiasm than cash, KPFZ is a registered nonprofit
with about 36 active members. It does not accept money from
businesses--the board of directors does not want the station's
programming to be influenced--only individuals, whom they solicit on
air, via word of mouth and through fliers placed at coffee shops and
book stores.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, KPFZ will move to a more centralized space in the
nearby town of Lakeport so the station can expand its programming and
"serve the community better," Weiss said. It's "the 'happening' part
of the county," he added. "At least as 'happening' as it gets up
here."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Charlie Kittleson, 50, will remain the last DJ of the
night. A San Francisco transplant, Kittleson DJs a stellar jazz and
blues program from 8 to 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   His entire show is planned in advance, each song listed in the
order he intends to play it, with the artist name, song title and
length. He's even choreographed in his microphone breaks. This
night's show began with San Francisco jazz musician Greg Cooper and
ends with Wes Montgomery</TE>
<TE>   At 9:58 p.m., as the last song is winding down, he leans into the
mike. "You've been listening to 'Jazz by the Lake,'" he coos in a
mellow voice modulated for radio. "Thanks again, and God bless."</TE>
<TE>   He lets the song run out and pulls down the mixing board faders.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Weiss is waiting in the laundry room to turn off the
transmitter for the night. He'll be back in the room tomorrow morning
to start it up again at 7.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title had an imposing ring: "Los Angeles at the
Millennium--Identity and Community in the 21st Century City." The
speakers' lineup was stacked with literary and cultural heavyweights:
Mike Davis, James Ellroy, Carolyn See. Even the official poster
design conveyed a sense of momentous occasion: pointillist rows of
L.A. city lights, blazing away toward an endless horizon under a
purple-and-gold Wagnerian sky.</LD>
<LD>   A tough billing, perhaps, for any conference to live up to. And,
as it turned out, this inaugural public symposium sponsored by the
Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities at USC only once or twice
reached the level of high drama or revelation.</LD>
<LD>   But for the speakers, panelists and several hundred other people
who showed up at USC on Friday night and Saturday, the free symposium
offered a chance to revisit some quintessential L.A. themes, exchange
gossip with friends and colleagues, enjoy some lively impromptu
street theater and take the pulse of a city that, in the words of
California State Librarian and conference moderator Kevin Starr, "if
it ever stopped trying to define itself would disappear from the face
of the Earth."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, as Starr suggested, this was hardly the first symposium
dedicated to a metropolis whose civic motto could almost be, "We
introspect, therefore we are." What made this one feel slightly
different was the crowd. Yes, there were the usual scholars,
journalists and public policy wonks who turn up at these affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But there also were spoken-word poets from Koreatown, trade union
leaders, aspiring novelists, community activists, MTA urban planners,
artists, lawyers, screenplay authors and various and sundry
bohemians. Though the panel groups contained many of the usual
suspects, the thinking was predominantly left-of-center and the
paradigms weren't exactly freshly minted, the atmosphere was
refreshingly nonacademic and informal. "It's nice to see there's
people with purple hair," observed Francis DellaVecchia, a one-time
unsuccessful L.A. mayoral candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the conference discussion contrasted private and public
visions of Los Angeles, the desire to engage L.A. at a meaningful
personal level versus the need to collectively address its enormous
social and economic challenges. There were calls not only for aiding
the city's poor but for nurturing its imagination, for finding a
shared "narrative" to express the city's unique history and prismatic
sense of self.</TE>
<TE>   Conceived as a bridge between town-and-gown interests, the
4-year-old institute had held previous speaker engagements, but none
on the scale of last weekend's. "This time we wanted to take a series
of issues that were far bigger than we could handle," said Steve
Ross, a USC history professor and the institute's co-director with
Steve Wasserman, editor of The Times' Book Review section.</TE>
<TE>   But before getting down to the business of panel discussions, the
conference absorbed an eloquent tongue-lashing from keynote speaker
Davis, the neo-Marxist scholar, author ("City of Quartz," "Ecology of
Fear") and MacArthur Fellowship ("genius grant") winner. A longtime
scourge of the city's boosters and shakers (City Hall, the Chamber of
Commerce, The Times), Davis, sporting a white beard and a tan,
unleashed a vintage, scathing critique of L.A.'s social inequities.</TE>
<TE>   Now back in Southern California after a few years on Long Island,
Davis drew parallels between slummy, corrupt New York City, 1902, and
the teeming immigrant mecca of Los Angeles, 2002. L.A., he said, is a
place where the low-wage immigrant labor and "Dickensian poverty" of
the many subsidize the "luxury lifestyles" of the few. Where
childhood poverty and youth unemployment rates are at Depression-era
levels, while crime statistics show L.A. to be "a far more dangerous
place than the New York City of 'Godfather II.'" (America's biggest
city was a frequent reference point throughout the conference, in
what Starr later termed "the New York metaphor, almost the New York
envy.")</TE>
<TE>   Leaving no fat cat unflayed, Davis upbraided Playa Vista
developers, "the secessionists of Sherman Oaks," and the recent spate
of lavish cultural temples that look down on a decaying metropolis.
He even chided the institute, which "in its bold attempt to create an
Algonquin Round Table," he said, had missed an opportunity by not
inviting Chicano studies professor Rudy Acuna, sci-fi/fantasy writer
Octavia Butler or some other non-Anglo personage of letters to
deliver the keynote address instead of him. He closed by exhorting
Angelenos to start a social "revolution" so as to save their city
from being "downsized by greed."</TE>
<TE>   Well. While Davis joked that the purpose of his speech was "to
ensure that I'd never be invited back," the Chardonnay-sipping,
cheese-munching crowd ate it up. Most stood and applauded. One man
yelled "Yeah!" from the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   At Q&amp;A time, however, Davis' thunder was co-opted by Mike Sonksen,
a.k.a. MIKEthePOET, who stood and delivered a righteous, minutes-long
hip-hop recitative ("I'm ALIVE in Los Angeles!") on the city's charms
and blemishes. Two accomplices backed him up with body-slapping
"percussion" while Davis stood smiling, arms folded. "You want to
respond in rap, Mike?" Starr finally asked Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Next morning at 10, when the conference resumed, many of Davis'
themes hung in the air like the rain clouds that scampered over the
campus. In the first of two panel discussions, KPCC radio host Larry
Mantle guided an eclectic four-member group on the theme of "Boomtown
Blade Runner: Los Angeles and Its Multiple Futures." Segueing from
nuts-and-bolts questions of jobs, political representation and
mutating Census data, the panel also pondered how the city's quest
for harmony and "social justice" could be translated into a common
story line.</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood city official and author D.J. Waldie ("Holy Land: A
Suburban Memoir") voiced concern that Angelenos lack "a coherent
narrative of our lives together." The old L.A. narrative, Waldie
said, was essentially a "sales pitch" concocted by real estate
speculators and marketing men intent on parceling up and selling off
an Arcadian fantasyland to East Coast and Midwest immigrants. He
suggested that L.A. now must find a new "narrative" to replace the
carny barker's call.</TE>
<TE>   A new narrative was fine with community activist Madeline
Janis-Aparicio, executive director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a
New Economy. But she believes that narrative already is being written
by working-class immigrants, who are organizing themselves around
grass-roots community and labor issues. Political empowerment, she
suggested, is the key to building a strong group identity, a shared
progressive story line. Los Angeles, she said, is "in denial. It
refuses to accept that poverty is our No. 1 challenge."</TE>
<TE>   USC history professor George Sanchez picked up on the theme,
emphasizing that L.A.'s emergence as "an increasingly Latino city,"
in line with California's similar direction, had supplied a new
narrative that encompassed Fresno farm workers as much as the
nannies, gardeners and pool cleaners who shuttle from Boyle Heights
to Brentwood. "There's a narrative we're missing," he said. "It's
about family, it's about dreams for the future, it's about
transforming our community."</TE>
<TE>   Harold Meyerson, former L.A. Weekly editor and now executive
editor of the American Prospect magazine, agreed that the city
suffered from the "absence of a broad civic consciousness." This, he
said, was caused by such factors as racist white flight, corporate
disinvestment, the sprawling size of county supervisor districts, the
mutual "invisibility" of different ethnic and economic groups and,
possibly above all, the collapse in the early '90s of the
aerospace-dependent middle class. "What happened was, the bottom
didn't drop out of the L.A. economy, the middle did," Meyerson said.
These anxieties have stoked the city's overlapping secession
movements and what Meyerson called a "privatization of identity."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you have any prescriptives out of this?" asked Mantle, who'd
been deftly goosing the conversation by playing devil's advocate. On
a more positive note, Meyerson cited Antonio Villaraigosa, who lost
last year's mayoral election to James Hahn, as an example of a
potential liberal coalition builder in the old Bradley mold.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch in the library courtyard was pure L.A. homestyle: spicy
chicken and beef, frijoles, arroz  and tortillas. If the morning
panel was about defining L.A. as a community, the afternoon session
was about how that community gets filtered through an artistic
sensibility--the L.A. of memory and desire rather than the L.A. of
hard facts.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting in the Intellectual Commons on the second floor of Doheny
Memorial Library, the four-person panel--novelists Ellroy ("L.A.
Confidential") Walter Mosley ("Devil in a Blue Dress") and Bruce
Wagner ("I'm Losing You") and novelist-memoirist See
("Dreaming")--pondered L.A. as a city of the mind. Moderator Michael
Silverblatt, of KCRW's "Bookworm" program, said he hoped that "this
panel will be more raffish and up-startish than the other."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before the tough-guy talk was flying, principally
from Ellroy and Wagner. Both disavowed any direct connection to
L.A.'s high-culture literary roots (Nathaniel West, Budd Schulberg),
professing instead a love of Mickey Spillane and the pulpier prose
pros. "I didn't read 'What Makes Sammy Run?' until three years ago. I
didn't read any of that [expletive]," Wagner said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellroy credited his becoming a writer to his father giving him a
copy of "The Badge" on his 11th birthday, and to the simple accident
of birth. "I was lucky my parents hatched me in a great locale with a
sexy criminal tradition," he said. Now living in Kansas City, Ellroy
said that when he visits his old neighborhood at Beverly and Western
in Koreatown, "I can't even read the signs." The native son is now a
stranger in a strange land. But L.A. still grips him, he said, like a
"hungry pit bull" with its jaws affixed to a vulnerable part of his
anatomy. "L.A. is a life sentence," he concluded.</TE>
<TE>   See said she, too, still gets lost in certain parts of town. The
city's variety and expanse makes it "a place you can't get a handle
on," she said, but what's wrong with that for a novelist? "You
couldn't possibly get it all in one novel, and why would you want to?
You just have to pick the scrap that you have." Mosley said that as a
young writer, he'd found that many parts of L.A. "are just, like,
unrecorded," such as the experience of African Americans who came
here after World War II from Texas and Louisiana. "I hope I'm able to
take different voices at different times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the panel broke up, the audience started to drift toward the
hallway and a waiting reception party. Flipping through a fistful of
scribbled notes, Starr tried to make sense of the past 36 hours in a
15-minute wrap-up. "We are, over time, becoming more like each
other," he summarized. "That's the glorious future, I think."</TE>

<HD>Out of Tragedy, a Legacy of Forgiveness</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Theirs was a personal tragedy with international implications. Their
daughter, Amy Biehl, a Stanford graduate and Fulbright scholar
working with impoverished blacks in South Africa, was stoned and
stabbed to death nine years ago by an angry mob of black youths who'd
just left a rally protesting apartheid.</LD>
<LD>   She was just one among thousands slain in that country's lurching,
years-long struggle against apartheid. But the irony of her
death--she was beloved by local blacks for her efforts to prepare
them to assume power--unleashed an international furor that helped
unify South Africans in their push for peace.</LD>
<LD>   And the response by Peter and Linda Biehl to their daughter's
murder left its mark not only on the South African township where Amy
died, and but on people around the world, moved by the couple's
commitment to translate their grief into projects to improve the
lives of those they might have blamed for the death of their child.</LD>
<TE>   The architect of that commitment, Amy's father Peter, died last
week in Rancho Mirage, one month after he was diagnosed with colon
cancer. And just as his daughter's untimely death left a legacy of
hope and peace, Peter's passing gives us a chance to consider the
redemptive possibilities of grief.</TE>
<TE>   As a mother, I cannot imagine being able to summon the grace to
forgive anyone who would kill my child. Amy's parents did that--and
more.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of her death in 1993, the Biehls had left their
Newport Beach home for South Africa to visit the families that had
befriended their daughter. There, they learned to draw on the spirit
and strength of a people and culture that Amy, at 26, had come to
love.</TE>
<TE>   They also saw firsthand the poverty and hopelessness that had
inspired Amy's efforts. They came to realize that economic
deprivation had fueled the anger and desperation that led to her
death. And they marveled that South Africa was not a more violent
place, given what Linda Biehl called the "insidious, deep-rooted
oppression" of the apartheid system black Africans were then forced
to live under.</TE>
<TE>   They responded by creating a foundation to sponsor the kinds of
projects that Amy had written about in her journals--a shelter for
battered women, a bakery to train locals to run their own businesses,
after-school programs for impoverished children.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Amy Biehl Foundation has spent more than $5
million on community development projects in and around Cape Town.
Among its employees are two of the four young men convicted of Amy's
murder and pardoned after five years in prison by an amnesty panel
that ruled the killing a political, rather than criminal, act.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, Linda Biehl says now that she and her husband went
to Africa not knowing what they'd find. They simply wanted to feel
close to Amy, to understand how and why she'd died.</TE>
<TE>   "But when you shake someone's hand--even though they might have
harmed you--you feel their touch, you look into their eyes. You say
you're a human being, just like me. It melts away the layers and gets
to the essence of what we are underneath ... just people, with all
the same wants and needs and emotions. Amy's death put us on a path
to realize that."</TE>
<TE>   It is a noble form of mourning, this practice of establishing a
legacy to a loved one by giving back in a way that enriches others.
We live with its benefits all around us. The death of a handicapped
little boy inspires his parents to build playgrounds adapted for
disabled children. A young girl is run down by a drunk driver and her
mother's anguish leads to the creation of MADD--Mothers Against Drunk
Driving--to keep drunk drivers off the road. A woman watches her
fiance drown in a flood-control channel and campaigns for swift-water
rescue training that will save who knows how many lives in storms to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Some families go even further, seeking comfort not through
retribution but through a process called restorative justice, which
aims to make amends by healing the offender and community. Consider
Ruett and Rhonda Foster, a Compton couple who began counseling
inmates at juvenile halls after their 7-year-old was killed by an
errant bullet in a gang shootout at their local park. Their efforts
will not bring Evan back, but may help other families avoid their
pain by convincing wayward boys to steer clear of crime.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is gaining favor in some countries, though it is not
likely to catch on here, in a nation obsessed with three-strikes,
life-without-parole and condemning even the mentally ill to die.
Still, for Linda and Peter Biehl, serving the community that Amy
loved seemed to be the only way to put the broken pieces of their
life back together in a way their daughter would recognize.</TE>
<TE>   The Biehl home is filling up with flowers again, just as it did
when Amy died. Telephone calls have come in from world leaders like
Nelson Mandela, and the fax machine is whirring nonstop with messages
of sympathy from around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes," Linda says, "the sun comes in the window, and I smell
the flowers and it takes me back to the days after Amy died. And I
think, we can't go through this again. We're not up to it. It just
brings everything back."</TE>
<TE>   She and her three children have decided not to have a local
funeral, but to hold a memorial service in Washington, D.C., next
month. Then Linda will head back to South Africa, where the Biehls
maintain a second home.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Amy's death sent her family down an unconventional path,
Linda expects Peter's death to inspire new initiatives. "I'm scared;
my stomach is butterflies," she admits. "But I feel fortunate; I'm
left with a purpose. I know Peter is looking at me to keep it going,
because there's so much still left to be done." She considers it
"amazing" that Easter Sunday was the day that Peter died. Nobel Peace
Prize winner Desmond Tutu called to remind her "that Easter stands
for resurrection, and resurrection means hope," she says. "And that's
what, really, this is all about. Giving people hope. Because if you
have opportunity, possibilities ... you can deal with almost anything
that comes."</TE>
<TE>   And I consider amazing the compassion she and her husband have
shown in the face of the unthinkable, and hope that I am never called
upon to be so merciful and strong.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The kids gaped at Weird Willie. Like everyone else, they thought he
was just some harmless old guy who shuffled around town. But without
his coat and hat on, they could see that he was obviously from
another planet. He wore a tight silver suit, but even stranger, his
mouth went the wrong way--up and down instead of from side to side!</LD>
<LD>   Weird Willie was about to run away, but Barry stepped forward and
raised his hand. "Hi," he said.</LD>
<LD>   "Er, hi," Weird Willie said uncertainly, his mouth moving from
side to side.</LD>
<TE>   "Are you from another planet?" Kyle asked.</TE>
<TE>   Weird Willie sighed. "I am," he said. "My real name is Ral, and
I'm a third assistant chef in the kitchen of Groulph, emperor of the
Thousand Galaxies."</TE>
<TE>   "Cooool!" all the kids said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not so cool," Ral said. "Many Earth years ago, the head chef sent
out all his third assistants to search the galaxy for a spectacular
new dish he could serve at Groulph's 400th birthday party, which will
happen in another few Earth months."</TE>
<TE>   "We have some really great food here on Earth," Barry assured him.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," Ral said. "Some of it is very good. But everything I've
tried can already be found in the official Thousand Galaxies
Cookbook. I need something really new."</TE>
<TE>   "What will happen if you don't find the food you're looking for?"
Alexis asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing much. But if I do find what the head chef is looking for,
he'll make me second assistant. If somebody else gets to him first,
I'll probably be a third assistant forever."</TE>
<TE>   "Bummer," Kyle remarked while Ral shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to help," Barry said.</TE>

<HD>The Call of the Wild</HD>
<DH>"Human Nature," a new film by French director Michel Gondry
("The Letter," numerous Bjork videos) from a script by Charlie
Kaufman ("Being John Malkovich"), wryly observes behavior encompassed
by the title through the interactions of a scientist (Tim Robbins),
an extraordinarily hirsute naturalist author (Patricia Arquette) and
the man they discover living in the wild (Rhys Ifans). David O.
Russell, writer-director of "Spanking the Monkey," "Flirting With
Disaster" and "Three Kings," volunteered as an astute observer of
human nature to go into the woods with Arquette and Gondry,
separately, for Calendar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David O. Russell: Did you like walking around in the woods naked all
the time making this film?</LD>
<LD>   Arquette: Well, I am very uptight and shy about being naked, so it
was hard for me to get comfortable. Luckily, we had the sweetest
crew, but it is still shy-making to be naked and hairy. Plus to be
naked and hairless, yet disguising a case of poison oak. I made
mugwort packs with vinegar for the cast and crew.</LD>
<LD>   Russell: You looked very comfortable, and sexy even, with the hair
on your chest and elsewhere. Did it take long to apply?</LD>
<TE>   Arquette: A long time, like six hours ... very itchy business.
And, I couldn't sit or my ... glue would crack. So It was pretty
intimate and awful.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily the makeup guy, Tony [Gardner] and I found a way to
survive. We spent a lot of time talking about Michael Flatley, "The
Lord of the Dance."</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Michael Flatley's been a lifesaver to so many actors
meeting a creative challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: Yes, also at a certain point I would freak out and start
thinking about whose hair was on my body. What was their life like,
and what sadness befell them to make them sell their hair?</TE>
<TE>   Russell: You were putting on the desperation of those victims of
commerce. The movie's about desperation, it's so original and
unconventional and funny and good. It's the role of a lifetime for
you. You get to sing; you go through an amazing emotional change.</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: I was so excited to get to play Lila and to work with
all the people involved: Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry, Tim Robbins,
Rhys Ifans, Rosie Perez and Spike Jonze. I loved that journey, from
being yourself to changing who you are, wishing yourself into someone
else's idea of perfection, then being found out as a fraud and
floundering in loss of self and loss of love. And on to reclaiming
yourself and self-acceptance.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: It's about so many things: What is beauty, what is love,
what is sex. The nudity was refreshing because it's all in the woods,
and it doesn't feel naughty or unnatural like other movie nudity.</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: My character, Lila, has this condition where she has
abnormal amounts of hair. There was a time when her sleek coat would
make her more desirable to males, but that time is long gone. Lila is
now left with the loneliness of hiding her true self to have love.</TE>
<TE>   I think even though many of us don't have that amount of hair, we
have this secret voice that tells us if we were only more or less of
this and that, we would deserve love. So we trek out into the world,
trying to be this something, this more desirable thing. Only to find
you have lost yourself, your truth, and very often you are still not
enough for the person whose love you long for.</TE>
<TE>   But those kind of people, those kind of lovers can never love you,
because they are blind in some way and they themselves have their
secret aspects that aren't enough.</TE>
<TE>   When Lila is nude in the woods, it is more her true self, and I
wanted her to be more comfortable being nude with hair. Later, when
Tim comes back at the end, although she is hairless, I wanted her to
be shy. So she is hiding more behind Rhys and covering herself
because she wants Tim's character to want her, but she is still
impacted by his criticism. So when he returns to the woods, with him
comes society.</TE>
<TE>   That's what I wanted for her and for me and for whatever women are
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a normal human specimen, not obsessed or self-indulgent in
being some gym Jones. I want us and me and Lila to get to a place
where we see and accept that we are made like this by God and we have
nothing to apologize for. But our own self-judgment and that of
society is so harsh, it is hard to ever find a place where we can be
free.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Did making the film affect how you feel about yourself?</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: Yes, I was in some conflict just in knowing the nature
of this business and hearing how great actresses aren't hired for
movies because some single-cell amoeba-like executive decides she is
not [desirable] enough. I knew I would have a harder time of it in
that arena.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Because you're hairy and it's the kind of thing that will
sicken Howard Stern?</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: That is a practical concern. But, my career has always
been on my terms, and I saw what a beautiful story it was and I loved
Lila and her hair. But, yes, I have an ego and want to be desired by
my man. So, yeah, I had to get past my own ego trap.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: You never felt beautiful when you're running through the
woods naked with your hairy body? It's a nice, soft, flowing blondish
kind of hair, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: I was going for a Brad Pitt look, and at the end of the
day I'd say there was a certain resemblance. There were moments when
I felt beautiful. And some of the crew would try to make me feel
nice, they'd say things like, "I never thought a hairy woman could be
so attractive," but the drivers would be harsh, they'd say, "What the
hell did they do to you?"</TE>
<TE>   Russell: I love the scene where your wig slips, and you're
nervously trying to please Tim Robbins, it's heartbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: Yeah, when my sister saw it, she said she almost cried
because it reminded her of our mom. And Lila really reminded me of my
mom, so I wanted that.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Your mother was a nudie model for soft porn magazines,
wasn't she?</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: Cheesecake. Very tame. Very voluptuous. My mom was an
open book, she changed so much in her life and she had no apologies
and she taught me to accept myself.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Then how was she like Lila?</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: I saw her transform that way in the course of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: When Tim Robbins' character has Lila, he wants Gabrielle
[Miranda Otto]; when he has Gabrielle, he wants Lila.</TE>
<TE>   Arquette: There are lots of people like that. My dad didn't really
see my mom till after she was gone.</TE>

<HD>Can He Build It? Yes, He Can!</HD>
<DH>Television* Stop-action animated 'Bob the Builder' has
constructed a following among the preschool audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER JENSEN</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luke Peters likes to play trains. He likes to swim and jump on the
backyard trampoline. But if you really want to see this 2-year-old
boy get happy, just start singing a certain TV theme song.</LD>
<LD>   Bob the Builder. Can we fix it? Bob the Builder. Yes, we can!</LD>
<LD>   Never heard of Bob the Builder and his sunny disposition? You
probably don't have a preschooler in the house.</LD>
<TE>   Bob is big, really big, with the sandbox set. His half-hour show
can be seen on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. lineup weekdays and Saturday
mornings on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   The show features Bob, a hard-hat-and-tool-belt-wearing
construction worker, and his entourage of talking machines, from a
digger named Scoop to the cement mixer Dizzy. He even has a human
assistant, Wendy, with whom he talks a lot on his cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   When "Bob's" on TV, Luke is just transfixed.</TE>
<TE>   "Luke's OK with 'Barney' or the Teletubbies, but when 'Bob the
Builder' comes on, he just starts screaming that song," said his
mother, Joyce Peters of Stewarts- town, Pa. "It's the show he gets
most excited about."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after it first aired on Britain's BBC One three years ago,
the stop-action animated TV show featuring movable plastic figures
became an overnight sensation in England. "Bob's" theme song, a
catchy little ditty with a "yes, we can" lyric repeated over and
over, turned into a best-selling single the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at HIT Entertainment, the British company that produces
the show and now markets it in 180 countries, said the concept was
relatively simple: Take heavy construction machines, which youngsters
love, and turn them into characters who work together.</TE>
<TE>   "What little boy doesn't own a truck?" said Holly Stein, HIT's
senior vice president of global consumer products. "Now, it's a truck
with a name and a personality. That's the icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   In the world of commercial children's television, such tie-in
opportunities are considered to be more than icing on the cake;
they're a big chunk of the cake. Already, "Bob" has generated more
than 600 products, from books and videos to plush figures, talking
toys, a laptop computer, Lego building blocks, and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   The show is not without its drawbacks, however. There is little of
what producers call an "overt curriculum"--no lessons in reading,
writing or arithmetic. That sets it apart from the more typical
preschool fare as "Barney," "Sesame Street" or "Blue's Clues."</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Bob live in a very diverse world: He and Wendy and all
their human friends are white. And Wendy often seems to be more
secretary than construction worker--hanging around the office while
Bob is building.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson said the lack of diversity is acceptable in the
context of a diverse Nick Jr. lineup. "Bob" is followed by such shows
as "Little Bill," which is about a black family, and "Dora the
Explorer," which features a Latina. The show's producers say "Bob"
may be getting a black cast member next fall.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "Bob" has something that many preschool shows don't: It's
not so painful for an adult to watch it too.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cute program," said Sandra Calvert, a Georgetown
University professor of psychology and occasional consultant to
Nickelodeon. "And it teaches kids to act in a pro-social ways. His
tools are his friends. I think that plays off children's imaginations
quite nicely."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Bob the Builder" can be seen weekdays at 9 a.m. on Nickelodeon
and Saturdays at 7 a.m. on CBS.</TE>

<HD>Ramey's Voice Brightens a Dark Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vaguely menacing, dressed entirely in black and looking more like a
couple of cops on an investigation than two musicians about to
perform, Samuel Ramey and pianist Warren Jones came onstage at
Segerstrom Hall on Sunday afternoon. Dim, noirish lighting added to
the dark impression.</LD>
<LD>   Then they proceeded to give one of the more satisfying recitals
the Orange County Performing Arts Center has witnessed in its first
16 years.</LD>
<LD>   How did they do it? Charm, smarts and utter concentration. These
two do not recite, they tell stories, narrate, infer, suggest, create
atmosphere and let tone and words do the coloring. Text is the
background on which they paint their musical drawings, and variety is
their most important tool.</LD>
<TE>   The program offered first a fascinating operatic gallery of
characters Ramey has played in his nearly 30-year career on the
stage; second, a pungent group of songs by American composers. Each
musical item contributed a different facet to the total.</TE>
<TE>   At 60, Ramey remains at a plateau of communicative command. With
his resourceful basso instrument, he can threaten, snarl, entice,
suggest, seduce, charm and convince, sometimes all in the same aria
or song. The power he wields over an audience, as he did over the
audience Sunday afternoon, comes out of sincerity, not artifice, and
he uses this power at all times pointedly.</TE>
<TE>   After warming up carefully in arias by Handel and Purcell, he
reached some dramatic peaks in arias from Boito's "Mefistofele" and
Carlisle Floyd's "Susannah." But he touched his listeners most deeply
in selections from Copland's "Old American Songs," in four showpiece
songs by Charles Ives and, particularly, in songs by the Gershwins
and by Cole Porter.</TE>
<TE>   With the complete and nuanced support of pianist Jones, Ramey made
"They All laughed," "Embraceable You," "I've Got You Under My Skin,"
"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" and "Don't Fence Me In" rare occasions of
deep pleasures, genuine sentiment and powerful feelings.</TE>
<TE>   His first encore was "Non piu andrai," from "The Marriage of
Figaro."</TE>

<HD>Old Space Acquires New Grace</HD>
<DH>A Manhattan movie theater that was reborn once for a Bach
marathon finds robust new life after a major facelift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERENA DOBNIK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Alec Baldwin. Dizzy Gillespie. Anjelica Huston. Leonard Bernstein.
John Updike. Meryl Streep. Dustin Hoffman.</LD>
<LD>   All have appeared live at Symphony Space, the once-dilapidated
Manhattan movie house that has became an eclectic and nationally
known arts center.</LD>
<LD>   It was not born from any grand plan but hatched from necessity as
two artists searched for a venue for their daylong free concert of
Bach back in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, after a $24-million fund-raising campaign and a year of
construction, Symphony Space celebrated its renewal with an official
gala reopening. The newly remodeled center features two glistening
theaters, a cafe and offices.</TE>
<TE>   Movies, music, dance and theater had filled this funky Art Deco
space on Manhattan's Upper West Side for more than two decades. But
Symphony Space is best known as the home of "Selected Shorts," story
readings that are aired on more than 150 public radio stations across
the country.</TE>
<TE>   The center's roots go back to the late 1970s, when two neighbors
came up with an idea: a daylong free concert called "Wall to Wall
Bach," with professionals playing and amateurs joining in.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Allan Miller and his neighbor Isaiah Sheffer, now
Symphony's artistic director, walked down Broadway and peered into
the Art Deco movie house that had seen a half century of decline.</TE>
<TE>   It would do, they decided, and rented the space.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers changed lightbulbs and cleaned bathrooms while calls
went out to the likes of violinist Pinchas Zuckerman, who lived
around the corner, and to members of the American Symphony Orchestra.
On Jan. 7, 1978, thousands of music lovers showed up for "Wall to
Wall Bach."</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Sheffer were drawn to the space, acquiring it that year
for $100,000 with the seller having an option to buy back the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the arts, Symphony Space was also the site for an
occasional wrestling match, including one pitting the famed Gorilla
Monsoon against the Golden Terror.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't quite Bach, but the wrestling helped pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   As the neighborhood's real estate prices rose, the sellers tried
to exercise an option to buy back the theater in 1985, triggering a
court dispute that lasted more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the $24 million raised for the project came from
selling air rights above the two-story center, resulting in a
22-floor luxury apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   Philanthropist Peter Norton gave $5 million, actor Leonard Nimoy
$1.5 million and the city of New York $1.5 million, with the rest
coming from other donors. The donations allow Symphony Space to offer
some "freebies," including a 12-hour marathon of Richard Rodgers
tunes last month.</TE>
<TE>   Symphony Space is still a smorgasbord. Gilbert &amp; Sullivan mixes
with African American storytelling; Cannibal Ox, a group that echoes
Harlem's street beat, performs along with Chicago's Isotope, a funk
and electro-jazz unit.</TE>
<TE>   The smaller theater in the complex, the newly named Leonard Nimoy
Thalia, opens on Saturday, showing 10 classic films with a New York
theme.</TE>
<TE>   Its walls have noise-absorbing fabric panels that flip to wood to
enhance the acoustics for chamber music performances.</TE>
<TE>   A shabby theater seat with cracked leather and a worn-out cloth
back sits in a glass case on the way to a theater balcony.</TE>
<TE>   It serves, says Sheffer, "just to remind you how we found this
place in 1978."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not too long ago, one would not have expected to see a group like the
young, modishly dressed Chicago-based new music sextet eighth
blackbird on the Coleman Chamber Music series. But things have been
changing at this once-immovable bastion of tradition lately, and the
group's collection of mostly newly commissioned works didn't ruffle
many feathers at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium on Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, for all of the irreverence that this group flaunts--from
the lowercase spelling of its name to the T-shirts and tattoos on
sale at the souvenir table outside--one can also sense a deeply
traditional strain in much of the music it plays.</LD>
<LD>   One of its recent commissions, heard in only its second
performance, was a piece from 86-year-old lion of serialism George
Perle. "Critical Moments II" was unrepentant yet remarkably fresh in
its spiky crystalline fragments, rapid atonal flurries and muted
wisps of sound.</LD>
<TE>   Another eighth blackbird commission, which occupied the program's
entire second half, was Daniel Kellogg's "Divinum Mysterium,"
generated by a 13th century vintage chant, equipped with sometimes
playful Hebraic rhythms and sporting an overall structure that had
the cumulative effect of a five-movement symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The Minimum Security Composers Collective, a consortium of four
onetime Yale graduate students, contributed four samples from
"di/verge." Though obviously contemporary in vocabulary, the four,
when heard together, seemed to form a more or less traditional
classical structure, complete with a scherzo and a slow movement in
the usual places.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it was Aaron Jay Kernis' "The Four Seasons of Futurist
Cuisine" for piano trio and narrator that struck the most irreverent
note of the afternoon, with its dada cookbook text and parodies of
tasty morsels from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Wagner's "Parsifal,"
Chopin's Sonata No. 2 and Debussy's "Clair De Lune," among others.</TE>

<KH>Michel Gondry</KH>
<HD>The Call of the Wild</HD>
<DH>"Human Nature," a new film by French director Michel Gondry
("The Letter," numerous Bjork videos) from a script by Charlie
Kaufman ("Being John Malkovich"), wryly observes behavior encompassed
by the title through the interactions of a scientist (Tim Robbins),
an extraordinarily hirsute naturalist author (Patricia Arquette) and
the man they discover living in the wild (Rhys Ifans). David O.
Russell, writer-director of "Spanking the Monkey," "Flirting With
Disaster" and "Three Kings," volunteered as an astute observer of
human nature to go into the woods with Arquette and Gondry,
separately, for Calendar.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Russell: Patricia told me to ask you to say, "squirrel."</LD>
<LD>   Gondry: Sqrrrrl.</LD>
<LD>   Russell: And to say "feral."</LD>
<TE>   Gondry: Ffrrrrl. She asked me how to say it in the movie, "feeral"
or "feral," and I said it my way, "ffrrrrl," which she laughed at for
the rest of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Patricia is a delight to work with. Did you feel
comfortable directing her naked for so much of the film?</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: I was shy as well, but I think I was honest with her. I
never tried to trick her to get her to do what was needed for the
story. An aspect you may notice in the film is that there is a lot of
nudity and sexuality, but they are never associated.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: Sometimes they were associated for me, but I know what
you mean.</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: I hate voyeurism. When you feel the director got his
little personal excitement during the take.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: How did you end up doing this movie?</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: I had read so many uninteresting scripts in Hollywood that
I had reached the conclusion they were boring in essence.</TE>
<TE>   Until Spike Jonze showed me the one he was about to direct ["Being
John Malkovich"]. I immediately begged Spike to introduce me to
Charlie and proposed to him a concept for a story. He started to work
on it, and in the meantime he let me read his spec scripts. "Human
Nature" was among them.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: So is Charlie working on something from your idea now?</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: Yes, he actually finished a story we will shoot next
November with Jim Carrey ["Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"].</TE>
<TE>   Russell: What's it about?</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: This guy finds out he has been erased from his
girlfriend's memory and decides to undergo the surgery himself. We
follow the process in his mind, witnessing their relationship
disappearing memory by memory.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: What was the most exciting thing about the script for
"Human Nature" for you? What made you want to do it? And then, how
did you see it as a film, what was your approach for directing it?</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: I guess it's always a scary decision when you choose a
movie to direct. You are embarking for a two-years holiday with few
friends, so you better like them and get along all right. For "Human
Nature" I immediately liked the characters. Lila, Nathan, Puff and
Gabrielle had a lot of imperfections, but they were all unique and
full of life on paper already.</TE>
<TE>   Plus the story was elaborated in a way that was satisfying for my
geometric brain. To direct it, I tried to avoid anchoring the film in
too basic of a reality. I tried to give a certain distance, an
artificiality to the location and maybe add some magic in them and
conversely have a very naturalistic approach on the acting.</TE>
<TE>   The most important thing was to never be in a position to mock or
laugh at my characters. I wanted the audience to be able to identify
with them. Especially Lila [Patricia Arquette], who could have been
seen as a monster. Instead of rejecting her, I noticed in the
screening that women were really supportive of her and generally
would admit they had a little bit of her in them.</TE>
<TE>   Russell: When Rhys Ifans is no longer a jungle boy and is refined
and neatly clipping his nose hairs, I thought to myself, "In a
nutshell, this is what the entire movie is about, the
self-mortification and identity issues around, for example, trimming
your wretched, unsightly nose hairs."</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: And the more you pull them, the stiffer they come back!</TE>
<TE>   Russell: It's interesting that you reach the saddest conclusion in
one of the most euphoric parts of the movie. The same reflection is
illustrated by Lila; her necessity to transform her appearance, even
her philosophy to hold on to her man. Tell me about working with
these actors.</TE>
<TE>   Gondry: Patricia is someone whose screen charisma is completely
true off screen as well. She is a charismatic and alive person.
Conversely, unlike other charismatic people on screen, she is not a
disappointment when you meet her for real.</TE>

<HD>Schneider Steps Into Limelight</HD>
<DH>Conductor dramatically displays her early love of dance as
she leads her orchestra in a multi-textured concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Schneider wanted to be a dancer when she was growing up in the
small Minnesota town of Windom. Instead, she became a composer,
working primarily in the genre of jazz but never abandoning either
her affection or her affinity for dance.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday evening at the Cal State Northridge Performing Arts
Center, Schneider also revealed that she hasn't really given up on
her physical connection with dance either. A slender, graceful woman
garbed in a tank top and black pants, she conducted her Maria
Schneider Jazz Orchestra with elegant balletic movements. Moving her
arms in willowy fashion, using her body to emphasize dramatic
highpoints, she had a quality of oneness with the music that was
reminiscent of Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York
Philharmonic.</LD>
<LD>   Visual presentation is appealing, of course, but the ultimate test
of a composer is in the music. And Schneider's music is like no other
in the jazz world. Working with the standard big jazz band
instrumentation of four trumpets, four trombones, five saxophones and
a rhythm section, she creates an astonishing array of multi-textured
sounds. Some were clearly influenced by her early apprenticeship with
Gil Evans in the '80s; others revealed inner contrapuntal movement
similar to the work of Bill Holman.</LD>
<TE>   But every composer has to start somewhere. And, despite the
occasional awareness of her youthful sources, Schneider's music was
the expression of a mature and complex musical mind, one that has
found a unique and personal creative voice of its own.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly three-hour program ranged through original works from
Schneider's three commercially released albums--"Coming About,"
"Evanescence" and "Allegresse" (all nominated for Grammy Awards)--as
well as a harmonically mobile arrangement of John Coltrane's "Giant
Steps."</TE>
<TE>   The highlights came with great frequency: the Latin rhythms of "El
Viento" framing a soaring trumpet solo by Greg Gisbert; the lovely
"Journey Home" and the title track from "Allegresse"; a movement from
her Monterey Jazz Festival-commissioned work, "Scenes From
Childhood," featuring tenor saxophonist Rick Margitza; the
atmospheric sounds and gutsy guitar work of John Hart on "Tork's
Cafe."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider also offered a particularly impressionistic work, "Hang
Gliding," as a convincing evocation of the feelings she experienced
while glidingfrom the mountains above Rio. And her "Three
Romances"--embracing everything from early Brazilian chorro to an
accompaniment for a classical pas de deux (symbolized by the solos of
trumpeter Ingrid Jensen and saxophonist Charles Pillow)--was the
product of a musical imagination that dances freely, unencumbered by
stylistic boundaries or prior musical definitions.</TE>

<HD>A Do-It-Yourself Therapy Session</HD>
<DH>The provocative songs of Eels' leader E let the audience
fill in the emotional blanks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you think of pop songs as recipes, some songwriters do all the
work for us. There's nothing left to do except add water and stir.
Many of music's most valuable writers, however, invite listeners to
be active participants in the creative process.</LD>
<LD>   Eels leader Mark Oliver Everett, who led his band in concert
Sunday at the El Rey Theatre, fits in the latter group. Like such
kindred spirits as Tom Waits and Randy Newman, Everett (who calls
himself simply E) provides provocative clues but encourages us to
draw our own conclusions about the often eccentric, troubled
characters in his music.</LD>
<LD>   You meet so many interesting case studies in Eels' highly
acclaimed new "Souljacker" album that it's a bit like spending a day
in a therapist's waiting room. The album starts with a boy who keeps
getting picked on at school because he's got too much facial hair,
and he's looking for anyone (his mother, Jesus) to save him.</LD>
<TE>   Who knows what the real problem is in "Dog Faced Boy"? But that's
what the therapist gets paid for. Meanwhile, the song invites the
outsider in us all to weigh our own feelings of insecurity and think
about how rational they are.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in "Souljacker," we run across a friendly ghost, a
teenage witch and a woman who drives the car while her husband
sleeps. Some of the characters are simply confused and harmless,
others so disoriented that they are a touch menacing. In one song,
Everett speaks about someone "marking time on a broken watch."</TE>
<TE>   "Woman Driving, Man Sleeping," one of the many songs from the
album performed during Sunday's 90-minute set, illustrates how
Everett invites us to use our own experience and outlook to fill in
the blanks.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the woman is driving and the man is sleeping could
simply be that it is her turn on a cross-country trip, but there's
something in the anxious melody that suggests something more
relationship-defining is afoot.</TE>
<TE>   Where Waits often romanticizes his characters' plight by putting
them in colorful late-night or barroom settings, Everett's figures
sometimes seem immobilized by their problems.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by an adventurous three-piece band (guitarist Joe Gore, the
single-named drummer Butch and bassist Koool G Murder) that played
with inspired precision, whether aiming for a "Louie, Louie" rock
primitivism or, more typically, sophisticated funk and rock trimmings
a la prime Talking Heads, Everett sang in a convincing,
straightforward style that allowed him to inject character into his
tales without violating the mystery in them.</TE>
<TE>   A bonus Sunday was the veteran performer's stage manner, which
seemed far more comfortable than three years ago in the same room. At
that time, his attempts to disguise his uneasiness with quirky
touches were self-conscious and distracting.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he put all his energy and emotion into the music, and
it gave the show a crisper pace and the songs a more solid
foundation. He still found time for playfulness, including a strong
dose of Missy Elliott's "Get Ur Freak On."</TE>
<TE>   What ultimately makes Everett's music so affecting is its
compassion, and that message was most obvious near the end of the
set, when he turned to material from his most personal and affecting
album, 1999's "Electro-Shock Blues."</TE>
<TE>   In the inspiring "P.S. You Rock My World," Everett notes how
pressures and uncertainties can cause people to lose their will. In
the song, however, he rejects such despair. "Maybe," he sings
hopefully, "it's time to live."</TE>

<HD>Feet of Clay? Sure, but as DVD Debut Shows, He's Still Got
Legs</HD>

<LD>He was once a little green slab of clay</LD>
<LD>   Gumby! You should see what Gumby can do today</LD>
<LD>   Gumby! He can walk into any book, with his pony pal Pokey too</LD>
<TE>   If you've got the heart then Gumby's a part of you</TE>
<TE>   --"Gumby" theme song,</TE>
<TE>   by "Sneaky" Pete Kleinow</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since making his TV debut in 1956, Gumby has never taken unfair
advantage in any situation. He's environmentally aware and loves
books and reading. Gumby drinks fruit juice and is especially fond of
carrot juice. He's never been mean and he doesn't drink or smoke.</TE>
<TE>   And now the little green boy made of clay and his pony friend
Pokey are making their DVD debut this week in a seven-disc set from
Rhino Home Video ($100 for the set; $22 for a single disc; $10 each
for two separate VHS volumes).</TE>
<TE>   The set features episodes from "The Gumby Show," beginning with
its 1956 premiere on NBC to the syndicated episodes from the late
1960s. The seventh disc offers extras: an interview with creator Art
Clokey and his son Joe, the pilot episode of "Gumby," an interview
with Dal McKennon (the voice of Gumby), Gumby storyboards, new scenes
featuring Gumby, Pokey and Rocky Rhino, and several of Clokey's early
art films, including "Gumbasia."</TE>
<TE>   During the last 46 years, Gumby has taken on a life of his own.
"He's bigger than any of us," said Joe Clokey. "In the '80s, when my
dad traveled the country speaking to colleges, they would always say,
'We love Gumby.' Wherever he goes now they say, 'We love Gumby.'
There is something about Gumby that connects with kids. I don't know
what it is--maybe the love Gumby has for kids and [that] Dad has for
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most animated characters, Gumby practices nonviolence. "He
was before 'Sesame Street,'" said Joe Clokey. "Before there was PBS,
there was Gumby and 'Davy and Goliath.' Both my parents did those
series. They were the only ones that weren't that violent. They were
more innocent. They had a lot of adventure and excitement for kids,
but they didn't use beating up on each other as that adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Art Clokey, who is now 80, made Gumby green because he is a great
fan of Walt Whitman's book, "Leaves of Grass." "Green was the color I
chose because of the universality of grass," said Art Clokey. Pokey,
he added, "is down to earth. He has his four feet on the ground. He
has an earthy color--the color of ceramic brick."</TE>
<TE>   Gumby's name is derived from the word gumbo. "On my grandfather's
farm in Michigan, when it rained sometimes we would get stuck in the
gumbo--the muck, the clay soil," said Art Clokey.</TE>
<TE>   Clokey became interested in art and clay when he was a child.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to draw all the time when he was a little kid in
Detroit," said his son. "It was amazing. He could have been a cel
animator, he was so good at it. I looked at these old drawings and
they were amazing. He also used to make soldiers out of clay."</TE>
<TE>   During the early 1950s, Art Clokey was in Los Angeles, working as
a schoolteacher by day and attending USC film school at night. He
studied under Yugoslav montage artist Slavko Vorkevich, who taught
kinesthetic film principles--a technique that induces a sensation of
movement and excitement through cuts, timing, screen direction and
color. Clokey put them to use in the first stop-motion animated
installments of "Gumby."</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the mid-'50s episodes, the first 42 episodes [on
the DVD], they are very Vorkevich," Joe Clokey says. "Dad had very
little dialogue. It was all action. Gumby was tripping around in toy
land."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the enduring success of Gumby was the character's sweet,
high-pitched voice. "I just elevated my voice in the back of my
throat," said the veteran actor and voice performer McKennon. "I
think the thing that really sold Art Clokey on the voice was not just
the voice [of Gumby], it was the fact I could do all the other voices
and the dialects."</TE>
<TE>   Both Clokeys enjoyed Eddie Murphy's takeoff on Gumby in the '80s
on "Saturday Night Live," playing him as a demanding, cigar-smoking
egomaniac.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason it was funny was because he is an American icon that
people love," Joe Clokey said. "That wasn't over the line. Later,
'Mad TV' went over the line. They had Gumby and Pokey on LSD."</TE>
<TE>   "Gumby" is coming back to television in a new movie scheduled for
ABC's "The Wonderful World of Disney."</TE>
<TE>   "We spent 10 months on the contract," said Joe Clokey. "My dad is
executive producer and he'll be creative consultant. If there is any
clay animation [in it], they will probably have us do it. We have a
new studio and we are hiring the best clay animators in the world."</TE>
<TE>   And the spiritual "Davy and Goliath" is also making a comeback.
The Lutheran Church, which sponsored the long-running series, has
hired the Clokeys to revive the show. "Right now, we are doing a
couple of 30-second spots for the church," said Joe Clokey. "It's
kind of like the old days."</TE>

<HD>Baggage Burdens Reichlin's 'Oz' Tale</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a credit to Louise Reichlin and Dancers that the artistic
director-choreographer would have the courage to update a classic by
the author of "The Wizard of Oz" and nearly get away with it. Bonnets
off to Reichlin, then, and her hard-working troupe on their take on
the lesser-known L. Frank Baum story "The Patchwork Girl of Oz," a
two-part multimedia program performed Sunday at USC's Alfred Newman
Recital Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Admittedly, the opus is geared for kids, but there was a lot going
on choreographically to sate a dance lover's appetite--sunny leaps
and marching motifs prevailed. Too bad Reichlin felt the need to
overload her staging with unnecessary videos, occasionally oddball
music and an uber-aggressive narration. If Reichlin trusted her
instincts and let her adaptation unfold on its own, she could,
perhaps, develop a perennial work.</LD>
<LD>   Flaws aside, there was some jubilant dancing: Janell Burgess
(Patchwork Girl), Adrienne Fisher (Ojo), Wil-son Williams and Brian
Pelletier in a number of roles, and Sarah Jenkins as an
arms-and-legs-akimbo Scarecrow.</LD>
<TE>   Linda Borough's colorful costumes pleased and there was a certain
naive quality that grabbed at the heart. Judy Garland would have

<LD>   Scorsese to Deliver 'Gangs' for Christmas</LD>
<LD>   Martin Scorsese's long-awaited "Gangs of New York" is now set to
premiere on Christmas week--a year after its original release date.</LD>
<TE>   According to Miramax Films, the epic about gang warfare in
pre-Civil War Manhattan has been trimmed from more than three hours
to less than two hours, 40 minutes--a refutation of a claim, made in
a story in Sunday's New York Times, that the studio and director are
engaged in a battle over the running time and Scorsese's desire to
shoot a new ending.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said that Scorsese screened a three-hour, 40-minute
version for Miramax executives last October. But according to Lois
Smith, publicity representative for Scorsese, that was only an
assemblage of footage, not a finished product.</TE>
<TE>   "Marty has cut it down since that time, and there's nothing in
that version he misses now," she told The Times Monday. "After the
fine-point editing, it may be even shorter than that. Though Marty
may shoot a new ending or add inserts, Miramax is going along with
his program. There was a sensational screening of 'Gangs' in New York
Friday night and [Miramax co-Chairman] Harvey [Weinstein] loved the
film. Whatever differences they've had between them have been
resolved. "</TE>

<TE>   Creative Clashes Put 'Fat Albert' on Hold</TE>
<TE>   "Fat Albert," a live-action version of Bill Cosby's cartoon
series, has been put on hold due to "creative differences" between
Cosby and the director, Forest Whitaker, who has exited the 20th
Century Fox film.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Hollywood Reporter, Cosby, who wrote the script
for the movie with Charles Kipps and is executive producing with his
wife, Camille, took issue with Whitaker's view of the characters.
Though Cosby had a story credit on "Leonard Part 6," this is his
first outing as a feature-film screenwriter.</TE>
<TE>   Cosby had reportedly hoped to translate the characters from an
animated world to a contemporary urban setting, where they'd raise
trouble a la "The Little Rascals." Whitaker has been quoted as saying
that the project is about "loving yourself and ... self-esteem." Fox
had hoped that the film would be what is known in industry jargon as
a "tentpole"--a moneymaker around which the rest of its schedule
could be built. Originally scheduled for a summer 2003 premiere, it
had been pushed back to Christmas. With no director now in place,
even that date is uncertain.</TE>

<TE>   Rio Officials Threaten Suit Over 'Simpsons'</TE>
<TE>   Tourism officials in Rio de Janeiro say they plan to sue the
producers of "The Simpsons" for what they decry as an unfair
portrayal of their Brazilian city in a March 31 episode called "Blame
It on Lisa."</TE>
<TE>   In that show, the family traveled to Rio to find a missing orphan
whom Lisa Simpson sponsors from abroad. Her father, Homer, was
kidnapped by a taxi driver, the family was assaulted by children and
they visited Rio slums infested by violent monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report in the daily O Globo, Brazilian critics
denounced the use of cliches and stereotypes and said the show
mistakenly linked Brazil to broader Latin American themes, such as
having Brazilian characters dance the conga and speak with Spanish
accents (most Brazilians speak Portuguese).</TE>

<TE>   'Today' Starting Its Own Book Club</TE>
<TE>   NBC is attempting to fill the void left by Oprah Winfrey's
decision to scale back her popular book selection segment.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in June, the "Today" show will launch its own monthly
book club. The show will have a best-selling author introduce a book
written by an undiscovered writer for the club to read. The following
month, "Today" will invite members of book clubs across America to
come on the show to get to know the selected book's author.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a natural fit for us," said executive producer Jonathan
Wald. "This program has always had a huge commitment ot the literary
community and a series like this allows us to take that commitment to
the next level."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Harper, Tony Roberts, and Michelle Lee have been cast in
this summer's Ahmanson Theater production of "The Allergist's
Wife".... Photographs of celebrities who have appeared at the
Hollywood Bowl will be displayed in the Hollywood Bowl Museum
beginning May 4. Judy Garland, Audrey Hepburn, Bette Davis, Bing
Crosby and Danny Kaye, among others, are shown in their dressing

late-night show at 11:35 tonight.... PBS' "Frontline" documentary
series is expanding. The first of four episodes of "Frontline/World"

the Museum of Contemporary Art closed Sunday--is this year's winner
of the Smithsonian Institution's Lucelia Artist Award, launched last
year to recognize an American artist under the age of 50 whose work
demonstrates exceptional creativity.... The bungled 1963 kidnapping
of Frank Sinatra Jr. is the subject of a movie for Showtime,

<HD>New Museum Will Celebrate California Art</HD>
<DH>Art* The Pasadena site, dedicated to displaying works from
1850 to today, will open June 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years after art collectors Robert and Arlene Oltman purchased a
piece of property in downtown Pasadena with the vague idea of
building a residence for themselves in a mixed-use facility, their
dream is becoming a reality. But they won't be living above a
boutique or restaurant, like a growing number of urban dwellers.
Instead, they are moving into the top floor of a three-story building
that houses the new Pasadena Museum of California Art.</LD>
<LD>   Dedicated to California art, architecture and design from 1850 to
the present, the $5-million museum will open June 1 with "On-Ramps:
Transitional Moments in California Art," a four-part exhibition of
definitive developments in California art history. Visitors will park
on the ground level, ascend to the second-floor deck and proceed to
the galleries, then check out the view from the rooftop terrace.
Located at 490 E. Union St., just around the corner from the Pacific
Asia Museum, the building is the work of MDA Johnson Favaro
Architecture and Urban Design of Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   Unusual as it is, the Oltmans' project has won the support of city
leaders. "It adds to Pasadena's standing as a center for arts and
culture, while making a unique contribution," said Mayor Bill
Bogaard. The museum's artistic mission is particularly appropriate
because it deals with "a period of California art that is very much a
part of Pasadena's past," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Oltman, 63, and Arlene, 62, are longtime residents of
Pasadena. "Some people have said we are giving something back to the
community," said Robert, who practiced architecture for 17 years
before co-founding his profitable business, Space Bank Mini Storage,
with partner Clayton H. Schubert. "We may be. But our real focus is
making people more aware of the arts movements that have taken place
here and the serious experimentation that is still going on today."</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Jessup, an art historian and former assistant director of
the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who
is executive director of the new museum, has lined up an ambitious
exhibitions program by hiring guest curators and booking traveling
shows. "On-Ramps," which runs through Sept. 1, is an in-house
creation compiled by four independent curators.</TE>
<TE>   The "Impressionism to Post-Impressionism" section was organized by
Nancy Moure, a specialist in early California art; "Post Surrealism,"
by Michael Duncan, a critic for Art in America magazine; "Hard Edge
Abstraction to Finish Fetish," by Peter Frank, a critic for L.A.
Weekly; and "Bay Area Conceptualism," by Thomas Solomon, a former Los
Angeles gallery owner. The artworks have been borrowed from museums
across the country, including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden in Washington, D.C., the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum at
the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and the Phoenix Art Museum
in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The second show, "Capturing Light: Masterpieces of California
Photography, 1850-2002" (Sept. 14 to Nov. 24), was organized by the
Oakland Museum. Next year will bring three home-grown exhibitions:
"Towards a New Cathedral: Calatrava, Meier, Moneo," focusing on three
architectural projects; "California Design Biennial"; and "Edward
Biberman: A Retrospective." Another 2003 show, "Not-So Still Life: A
Century of California Painting and Sculpture," will come from the San
Jose Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a great breadth of material to work with," Jessup said.
While some exhibitions will probe particular styles or periods,
others will "create a dialogue between the old and the new," he said.
"There is such a divide. Aficionados of plein-air or Impressionist
painting have difficulty appreciating contemporary art, and it's hard
for lovers of contemporary to get into Impressionism. I hope that
'On-Ramps' and shows that look at one genre over the course of a
century will cultivate an audience with a broad appreciation of
California art."</TE>
<TE>   Critical and public response to the fledgling museum remains to be
seen, but some of Jessup's peers have already expressed approval.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm impressed with the curators they've gotten involved and I
think very highly of the architects," said Jay Belloli, director of
art programs at the nearby Armory Center for the Arts. "This city is
not very good about knowing its own artistic history. Anything that
helps that along is certainly worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Williams, a curator at the Norton Simon Museum, said the
new museum is "only going to be good for the city." Along with its
artistic point of view, the museum will provide an occasional
showcase for works in other institutions' collections that are often
in storage, she said. For starters, the Simon has loaned four pieces
of contemporary art to the opening show. "It's a wonderful
opportunity to present these works in a different circumstance,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The Oltmans' project has taken the Southern California art
community by surprise, partly because they have not been high-profile
collectors. Modest and soft-spoken, they discuss the evolution of
their museum as if it were just another stage in their long life
together, but they acknowledge that it has grown far beyond their
initial impulse to live in downtown Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The property on North Union Street is in a commercial zone in the
historic Pasadena Playhouse district, where mixed use is encouraged.
Any residence built there had to be attached to a commercial or
nonprofit venture. The question was what that enterprise would be,
Arlene Oltman said. But the answer came fairly quickly. "Bob loves
art; I love art," she said. "We decided that a museum would be an
interesting thing to explore."</TE>
<TE>   In 30 years of collecting they have accumulated about 300
paintings, including works by 18th century Europeans, 19th century
Americans and California plein-air artists. They also have hosted
weekend exhibitions of contemporary art at their home.</TE>
<TE>   But they had a lot to learn about art museums. One major
revelation was that to operate a nonprofit, tax-exempt museum, they
couldn't simply display their own collection all the time, as
planned. They would have to present an educational exhibition program
for the public.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for a way to meet tax law requirements while filling a
niche that would satisfy their own interest in art, they discovered
"a gap," Robert Oltman said. "We found a need for a museum that truly
dedicated itself to the California arts historically to the present
time."</TE>
<TE>   Then they ran national ads for an executive director and hired
Jessup, a 32-year-old native of Alaska who was educated in art
history at Cal State Fullerton and the City University of New York.
He started his career in 1994 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in
New York, where he organized traveling shows. In 1998 he went to work
for the Spencer Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Jessup, who has been on the job since December 2000 and is one of
only four full-time employees, said he was attracted to the museum
because "there is nothing else like it." Another selling point: "L.A.
is still very much in the process of becoming something, as opposed
to New York, which has already become what it is going to be," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena museum is also a work in process. The collection will
not be on public view for a while, but the Oltmans plan to develop it
over time, in keeping with the museum's mission. Both the collection
and the building, which they own through a nonprofit corporation,
will be bequeathed to the museum.</TE>
<TE>   As for finances, the museum has an annual operating budget of
about $500,000 and no endowment. Although the Oltmans have put a big
chunk of their own money into realizing their dream, they hope to
build financial support from other sources through memberships,
bookstore sales, contributions and rental of the rooftop terrace for
special events.</TE>
<TE>   "The game plan is to get the community involved--throughout
Southern California, not just Pasadena," Robert Oltman said.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will open with 8,000 square feet of exhibition space,
but that is expected to grow as well. Architects Steve Johnson and
Jim Favaro designed the 30,000-square-foot building with 10,000
square feet of parking on the first floor, as required by the city.
But the cavernous garage may be converted into galleries when
exterior parking becomes available. The Oltmans' 5,000-square-foot
living space is also a temporary arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the architects a difficult problem," Robert Oltman said.
"We wanted an architectural icon, a museum with maximum flexibility
and a residence. Finally, the idea is that when Arlene and I pass on,
or we get tired of living in downtown Pasadena with car alarms and
all of that, the top floor will become part of the museum as well.
The building is laid out to meet our needs and the future needs of
the museum. The architects did a fantastic job."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early on in "Compleat Female Stage Beauty," which opened Saturday at
the Old Globe, Shakespearean actor Edward Kynaston is horrified to
learn that King Charles II is about to lift the ban on women
appearing on stage.</LD>
<LD>   Kynaston had become a superstar by playing female roles and is in
the midst of a triumphant run as Desdemona in "Othello" when his
world starts to crumble.</LD>
<LD>   "A woman playing a woman?" he wails. "What's the trick in that?"</LD>
<TE>   Based--loosely--on real events and real people, "Compleat,"
directed by Mark Lamos, catches England and the Restoration stage in
the throes of upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   The year is 1660, the Puritans have been routed, and the
licentious Charles Stuart is back from his travels and in a mood for
some randy fun.</TE>
<TE>   That Kynaston's career becomes collateral damage in this culture
shift is of no mind to the frisky monarch.</TE>
<TE>   "Give the girls a chance!" he roars.</TE>
<TE>   "Compleat" gives us two hours of backstage backstabbing and sexual
high jinks, spiced up with an abundance of X-rated language and three
brief glimpses of frontal nudity (two female, one male).</TE>
<TE>   There's also enough sexual politicking--gay, mostly--to fill a
convention hall.</TE>
<TE>   Using a Shakespeare play as a framework for one's own creation is
not a new approach.</TE>
<TE>   "Shakespeare in Love" this is not. More like "Shakespeare in
Drag."</TE>
<TE>   The rise and fall of Kynaston (1643-1712) is not the stuff of
compelling drama, and "Compleat" cannot seem to decide whether to
play him as an artist in crisis or a self-involved theater twit.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Petkoff as Kynaston struggles with the contradictions of
his role but never settles on a consistent approach.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best put-downs comes after Petkoff reels off a prolix
explanation of why men are better than women at playing female parts.</TE>
<TE>   "You obviously have thought longer on this question than I have,"
deadpans Samuel Pepys, played to near perfection by David Cromwell.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Hewitt is a delight as the leering king whose busted syntax
seems, well, almost presidential.</TE>
<TE>   David McCann is a wonderfully sarcastic royal retainer who opposes
lifting the ban on females, and Steve Hendrickson is suitably
reptilian as Sir Charles Sedley.</TE>
<TE>   Although the play has "female" in the title, the women's roles are
the most disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Krista Hoeppner as Margaret Hughes, the first female Desdemona,
never engages, and Kwana Martinez as the strumpet Nell Gwynn chases
after a Cockney accent like a butterfly-hunter with a net.</TE>
<TE>   Take away a few speeches from "Othello" and the dirty talk, and
"Compleat" has the form of a rather predictable show-biz biography:
the difficult upbringing, the hard-won success, the highly publicized
flops and finally the heroic attempt at a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   There are no surprises, and the sexual politics are strictly P.C.</TE>
<TE>   "Compleat" was written by Jeffrey Hatcher, who joined the Globe as
its first playwright-in-residence under a $1-million grant from
patrons Donald and Darlene Shiley.</TE>
<TE>   The Globe will present two more Hatcher productions.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the hooting and clapping at the four-letter language
and the quiet-as-church attention to the simulated sex scenes, staid
old San Diego has a pent-up demand for such stuff. Who knew?</TE>
<TE>   "Compleat Female Stage Beauty," Old Globe Theatre, Balboa Park,
San Diego. Through April 27. 8 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 7
p.m. Sundays. Matinees 2 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. $25 to $50.

<LD>The 11th annual Lester Horton Dance Awards honored a wide range of
styles and companies at ceremonies Sunday at the Japan America
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Presented by the Dance Resource Center of Greater Los Angeles and
named after a locally based modern dance pioneer, this edition of the
awards was hosted by choreographer-impresario Deborah Brockus and
dance company administrator Erwin Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The awards went to work presented in 2001 and reflected the
choices of a 15-member nominating committee and the votes of the DRC
membership.</LD>
<TE>   Dancer-choreographer Jamie Nichols of contemporary ensemble Fast
Feet, and choreographer-company leader Heidi Duckler and her Collage
Dance Theatre, which specializes in site-specfic events, emerged as
big winners. Multiple Hortons also went to world dance choreographers
Ramaa Bharadvaj of the Angahara Ensemble and Jamal of Avaz
International Dance Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Horton lifetime achievement awards went to R'wanda Lewis, longtime
choreographer, teacher and company leader; Marion Scott, a dancer,
choreographer and teacher who heads the Spirit Dances series at
Highways; Yvonne Mounsey, former New York City Ballet principal
dancer and founder of West Side Academy. Lifetime achievement awards
sponsored by the California Arts Council went to choreographer and
now UC Irvine professor of dance Donald McKayle, and co-founder of
the Aman and Avaz world dance companies, Anthony Shay.</TE>
<TE>   Speeches by presenters and winners introduced a feisty political
edge this year.</TE>
<TE>   Winner Bharadvaj described the financial perils of a dance career
and ridiculed dancing without payment and for mere exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Among the presenters, Lula Washington, head of Lula Washington
Dance Theatre, asked that the Hortons offer a cash award in the
future. Choreographer Karen Goodman wanted more media coverage of the
event and Jordan Peimer, of the Skirball Cultural Center, suggested a
number of Horton reforms--including fewer awards.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pro wrestling occupies a gray zone of sports, requiring tremendous
athleticism and a competitive nature even though the outcome is
predetermined. "Bodyslam! The Making of a Professional Wrestler"
veers into a gray area of its own, chronicling the struggles of four
hopefuls but also coming across at times as a promotional vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   With a touch of gentle humor, the documentary (10 tonight, TLC)
begins by introducing Drzan McBee, a former NFL cheerleader, a mother
and a born-again Christian; Big Jon Heidenreich, an ex-NFL player who
works two jobs as a bouncer to make ends meet; Mikey Henderson, a
would-be "Backstreet Boy" of wrestling desperate to leave his
father's firewood business; and Chris Daniels, a.k.a. the Fallen
Angel and the elder statesman of this group.</LD>
<LD>   Despite varying levels of experience, all four have come to
Ultimate Pro Wrestling, a Southern California production company and
school, to wrestle on the independent circuit, a kind of minor league
to the WWF. They follow a strict regimen of pumping iron, perfecting
the full nelson and reciting self-aggrandizing soliloquies.</LD>
<TE>   Pursuing the dream takes a physical and emotional toll. "Anybody
who's a professional wrestler is paying a dear price," says
Heidenreich, who breaks his hand during practice. It adds injury to
the insult of losing the girlfriend he left behind in Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers skillfully illustrate such sacrifice, as well as
the demands of showmanship. First, Henderson grapples with portraying
the villainous persona given him by writer-referee Marty Rubalcaba.
Later, he and his opponent walk through their moves with the
concentration of ballet dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Bodyslam!" has many strengths, it is sometimes swept up in
the hype, with narration more befitting an infomercial than a
documentary. Meanwhile, Ultimate President Rick Bassman repeatedly
touts his school as the, well, ultimate place to learn, but the film
never states how much a person must pay ($3,750 to $5,250 for new
students, according to the school's Web site). It's one of several
details that could have better rounded out this tale of the square
ring.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After weeks of bitter squabbling and name-calling, New Line Cinema
and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer are on the verge of an accord that would
allow New Line to resume the use of the title "Austin Powers in
Goldmember" on this summer's third installment of the popular James
Bond parody.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations were continuing Monday, and sources from both
studios say an agreement could be reached in the next day or two. The
terms being discussed have not been released.</LD>
<LD>   An agreement would clear the way for New Line to launch almost
immediately what is expected to be a massive marketing campaign for
its new Austin Powers film--using the "Goldmember" title. The film is
scheduled to be released July 26 in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.
Early polling by the studios places "Austin Powers in Goldmember" as
one of the four most recognizable films coming out this summer, along
with "Men in Black II," "Spider-Man" and the new "Star Wars" movie.</LD>
<TE>   In January, a three-member arbitration panel of the Motion Picture
Assn. of America ruled that New Line could not use the title because
it hadn't been properly registered with the MPAA. After that ruling,
New Line launched a nationwide effort to recall its marketing
materials containing the title "Austin Powers in Goldmember." This
included thousands of posters as well as movie trailers.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy was made all the more bizarre when football fans
watching this year's Super Bowl game on Fox were treated to a
commercial spot for the movie featuring comedian Mike Myers, who
stars as the bespectacled '60s-era British secret agent--but without
revealing the title. For weeks afterward, New Line simply referred to
the movie as "Austin Powers 3."</TE>
<TE>   The MPAA panel took action after MGM and its sister banner, United
Artists, complained that "Austin Powers in Goldmember" was an
infringement on their 1964 Bond film "Goldfinger," which starred Sean
Connery as Agent 007. In the new movie, Myers plays a villain called
"Goldmember."</TE>
<TE>   New Line had the right to re-petition the MPAA to use the title in
mid-June. But the studio felt it needed to crank up its marketing
campaign long before that, because this film will be its biggest
summer release, so it pushed for an agreement with MGM to end the
impasse.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy was sparked after New Line went out early with the
title last fall without properly registering it with the MPAA. The
studio admitted it had goofed but later hoped that the issue could be
resolved amicably, because precedent had already been established
with the previous film, "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." In
that case, MGM had filed an objection to the title but lost the MPAA
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The current case follows months of angry charges and
countercharges that flew between the studios.</TE>
<TE>   New Line claimed that MGM officials approached them with an offer
to drop their objection provided that New Line agree to move the
release date on its new Denzel Washington movie, "John Q," which was
opening opposite MGM's new Bruce Willis film, "Hart's War." MGM
strongly denied the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, sources said, New Line executives had allegedly
approached MGM officials at a pre-Golden Globes party at the home of
William Morris agent Jim Wiatt, offering to move "John Q" in return
for a favorable decision on "Austin Powers." New Line has denied that
allegation. "John Q" and "Hart's War" were both released Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   To its defenders, Austin Powers is clearly a parody that cannot be
confused with Bond. They say the comedy serves to introduce today's
young audiences to Bond, who aren't as familiar with the super-sleuth
as baby boomers are.</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery" debuted in 1997 with
$53.9 million in domestic box office, followed two years later by the
sequel "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me," which grossed $205.4
million in North America alone.</TE>

<HD>An Unqualified Champ in 'Topdog/Underdog'</HD>
<DH>Suzan-Lori Parks' Pulitzer-winning tale of two brothers
springs to life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA WINER</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The place, according to the program, is "Here." The time is "Now."
And life for the African American brothers named Lincoln and Booth
has always been a tough hustle.</LD>
<LD>   Here and now on Broadway, however, the news is suddenly good. Make
that terrific--in a gritty, giddy, about-time sort of way.
"Topdog/Underdog," the hot-wired Suzan-Lori Parks duet that opened
Sunday at the Ambassador Theatre, feels richer, fresher and tighter
than when I saw the two-character comedy-drama late in its celebrated
run last summer at the Public Theater. Not only does the evening move
with an exhilarating throb of street and family heartbeats, but the
play has been opened with good timing too--on Monday it was awarded
the Pulitzer Prize for drama.</LD>
<LD>   Presumably, we have director George C. Wolfe to thank for holding
out for a big-time transfer of a play that should, for starters, hand
the commercial theater those highly elusive young and diverse
audiences. Even after Don Cheadle, half of the all-important alchemy
with Jeffrey Wright, left to fulfill a movie commitment, Wolfe and
company turned up with a wild card that happens to be as impressive,
in different ways, and an even more incendiary box-office seduction.</LD>
<TE>   Mos Def, the socially conscious rapper and poet, makes a smashing
major-theater debut here as Booth, little brother of Wright's
Lincoln. Although Def, the brains behind HBO's upcoming "Def Poetry"
series, has had acting roles in an assortment of movies and TV, there
was no way to know how spectacular he would be in this virtuosically
tricky role. He feels as authentic and inexorably right as Savion
Glover did when Wolfe decided Broadway needed the edgy tapper's
"Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, of course, was introduced to Broadway by Wolfe in "Angels
in America" before Hollywood found the actor for "Basquiat" and
"Shaft." For all his gifts, however, Wright can sometimes preen
onstage when he loses interest in anything but his own character.
There is none of that now with the challenges of bouncing off a
different offbeat set of gifts. These brothers don't look much alike,
but we believe they share a lifetime of family hurt and love, a bond
that lets tension out with an incantatory power of playfulness and
pain.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, in "The American Play," Parks created a character
whose job was to impersonate Abraham Lincoln in an arcade while
customers pretended to be John Wilkes Booth. This altogether bizarre
and irresistible idea is expanded here in her most accessible--though
no less incendiary--work. Wright not only plays a character named
Lincoln, but his job is to provide a recreational thrill for would-be
assassins--as he says, for "businessmen smelling like two-for-one
martinis" and "housewives with they mouth closed tight, shooting more
than once."</TE>
<TE>   Link, as Booth calls him, works in horrifying white face, a
crumpled stovepipe hat and a fake old black coat, making less money
than a white guy but more than the wax dummy that threatens his
livelihood. Def brings a marvelous new sweetness to Booth, the
needier brother with the short fuse, a loser who has the moves to
shoplift--"to boost"--layers and layers of sharp suits (by Emilio
Sosa) but who can't master the rhythms his brother had before he gave
up hustling three-card monte. But Booth at least has a home--a tiny
room designed by Riccardo Hernandez with peeling walls, a single bed,
a reclining chair and single bulbs from which Scott Zielinski makes
scary shadows. Link, thrown out by his wife, sleeps on the chair.</TE>
<TE>   Parks lets us watch each man practice his grift in solo scenes,
fooling customers by fooling themselves. Parks writes with a poetry
that pushes the senses while shoving along the inexorable story.</TE>
<TE>   Alongside smart bits of music, from hip-hop to John Lee Hooker and
Ornette Coleman, Link surmises that their parents, who abandoned
them, succumbed to "something out there they liked more than they
liked us." Booth says, with a lovely pride, "I stole and I stole
generously." At first, when they talk about their "inheritance," we
think it's a joke. But it is as real as the legacy of their tragic
metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   How is it that Wolfe also directed the triumphant, old-fashioned
show-biz Elaine Stritch showcase this season? Such versatility is
amazing. Guess who's top dog on Broadway again.</TE>

<LD>Jittery investors rightfully are hammering the stock prices of
companies whose financial reports present more questions than
answers. Adelphia Communications Corp.'s market value tumbled by 51%
on fears that accounting practices were benefiting company founder
John Rigas, whose family controls the cable television giant. Qwest
Communications International Inc.'s share price has been cut by half
because of accounting concerns. The need for serious reforms is no
longer debatable.</LD>
<LD>   New World Restaurant Group (bagel stores), Reliant Resources Inc.
(energy) and KeySpan Corp. (natural gas) late last week joined the
growing list of companies facing SEC investigations. The chief
executive of the company that publishes TV Guide is scrambling to
placate shareholders after acknowledging that he wrongly recorded an
anticipated legal settlement as revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The rash of Securities and Exchange Commission investigations is
further spooking investors already rattled by the recession, the war
on terrorism and the Middle East. Additional scrutiny is welcome,
even if it increases market turmoil in the short term, because
investors need full disclosure to navigate what a federal regulator
describes as the "seductions and terrors" of the market.</LD>
<TE>   Regulators must discover how widespread accounting irregularities
were at the end of the 1990s economic boom. Xerox Corp., for example,
will pay a record $10-million SEC fine and restate five years of
financial results. The SEC also says Waste Management Inc. inflated
profits by $1.7 billion in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are trying to do their part. The SEC is fielding an
average of 525 e-mail complaints daily, up from an average of 365 a
year ago. Ten years ago, an SEC chairman described his agency's
toughest challenge as "how to deal with the confusion and lack of
information among investors." The situation, from the investor point
of view, is worse today.</TE>
<TE>   Investor confidence requires that accountants employ clear,
factual language that casts light instead of shadows. The SEC
deserves the budget and manpower to make that happen, and to cope
with the post-Enron surge in enforcement and monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it would be grand if all corporate executives were to return
to managing their companies for long-term growth and quit concocting
gold-plated earnings reports that attempt to prop up stock prices. It
would also be fun to see pigs fly.</TE>
<TE>   Only the SEC can enforce truth and transparency. It is a task that
SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt has seemed reluctant to embrace. The latest
batch of corporate confessions should clear up his doubts.</TE>

<LD>The Clinton administration made a mistake when it failed, until it
was too late, to involve Arab nations in trying to bring peace to the
Middle East. President Bush has learned from that error, dispatching
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to meet with leaders of Morocco,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt before he heads for Israel. Arab
nations can influence not just the Palestinians but each other. Saudi
Arabia, for instance, won acceptance for its peace proposal involving
"normal relations" with Israel even from Syria, a more radical nation
with great influence over groups attacking Israel from Lebanon.</LD>
<LD>   Powell's schedule, though not the trip itself, raised some
eyebrows among Arab states. The king of Morocco sharply asked Powell
Monday why he didn't go to Jerusalem first, to apply immediate
pressure to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to end Israel's continued
occupation of West Bank cities. Powell said he wanted to consult
first with Arab and European nations.</LD>
<TE>   A reasonable answer, but Powell's timetable unfortunately left the
door open for more Israeli attacks on Palestinian territories in the
West Bank, an onslaught that began nearly two weeks ago after a
suicide bombing killed two dozen Israeli civilians at a Passover
dinner. Sharon has rejected U.S. demands that he halt the offensive
"without delay," and Israeli troops are expected to start withdrawing
in force only when Powell arrives.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting between Palestinians and Israelis has sparked
demonstrations in Arab nations including Jordan and Egypt, which
broke with their brethren years ago and extended diplomatic
recognition to Israel. Now they find their citizens asking what
benefits have come from relations with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Washington is leaning on Israel to stop its military
attacks, Arab nations should pressure Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat to stop the Palestinian violence. Powell, who has not
committed to meeting with Arafat, should do so despite fears in
Israel that the meeting would bolster the prestige of Arafat, whom
Sharon has tried to isolate. Washington has made clear that it
disagrees with Sharon's contention that Arafat is irrelevant and with
demands by some Israelis that the Palestinian Authority be destroyed.
That should not stop Powell from also meeting with Palestinians who
might succeed Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Arab nations know that Arafat blundered two years ago in not
accepting the offer of a Palestinian state made by then-Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David after lengthy negotiations brokered
by President Clinton. When Arafat's recalcitrance became apparent,
Clinton asked Arab nations to help, but that plea came too late.
Palestinian violence against Israelis began soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has no choice but to redouble efforts to bring
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators together. That will require
support from those who might have Arafat's ear. Whatever Arab leaders
may say for public consumption during Powell's visit, none of them
can be happy with the Palestinian leader. This is their chance to
push from one side while Powell pushes from the other.</TE>

<HD>The Village Robot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it takes a village to build a robot. Last weekend a bunch
of the radio-controlled contraptions, built by ad hoc villages of
students, engineers, teachers, parents, siblings and hangers-on from
across California, Arizona, Washington and Hawaii, gathered to
compete in a regional contest that fused soccer and basketball with
high-tech bumper cars. Here was the scene at the Los Angeles Memorial
Sports Arena on Saturday:</LD>
<LD>   Robots of every description, each topped with a flashing red or
blue light, careered about on a basketball court-size playing area.
Rock and rap boomed, and an emcee with skunk-striped blue hair
rampaged across the floor whipping teams of joystick-wielding high
schoolers and their pompom-waving supporters into frenzies. Bubbles
and candy flew through the bleachers. Orange and green soccer balls
arced over the court. Stadium-size video screens zoomed in on the
action.</LD>
<TE>   The rules for building the robots and for the contest are
complicated, and to describe them would be to detract from the praise
due the competitors. Instead, take a look in the pit area, where
revved-up students and grown men and women following their tinkerer's
bliss frantically welded and hacksawed and fine-tuned machines built
from uniform kits provided to each team. Subtle flirting mixed with
overt ingenuity. Tough competitors cooperated, swapping parts and
brainstorms. Some of the machines seemed as if they were ready to
waltz across Mars--NASA and JPL co-sponsored the event. Others looked
like the tragic results of junkyard explosions.</TE>
<TE>   The contest is called the FIRST Robotics Competition. It was
launched in 1989 by New Hampshire inventor Dean Kamen (best known
lately for his adult scooter, the Segway Human Transporter) to teach
kids that engineering and technology can be as cool as celebrity and
sports. (Though in all honesty, the FIRST acronym--For Inspiration
and Recognition of Science and Technology--could use some work.) With
the help of dozens of corporate sponsors, including TRW, Boeing, Ford
and Rocketdyne, teams from 60 schools both public and private
competed. From Los Angeles, that included Dorsey, Lincoln and
King/Drew Medical Magnet high schools, as well as Campbell Hall and
the Archer School for Girls. The teams worked six weeks, pulling
all-nighters in company shops or parents' garages, to complete their
designs.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to the regional winners, including Chatsworth
High, which will go on to the FIRST finals in Orlando, Fla.
Congratulations too to everyone who saw the importance of
participating in an event that, besides being what looked like a pure
blast, may also turn some lives around. When a village builds a
robot, better humans sometimes result.</TE>

<LD>It is hypocritical of President Bush to demand that Israel pull back
from its efforts to eliminate the terrorist infrastructure on the
West Bank (April 7). After Sept. 11, after declaring war on
terrorism, after the military campaign in Afghanistan (still
ongoing), after declaring that he would never negotiate with
terrorists, he now insists that Israel must negotiate with terrorists
and does not have the right to protect its own citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's fight against terrorism is our fight too. After Sept. 11,
how can anyone doubt that the terrorists training and practicing on
the West Bank will come here next?</LD>

<TE>   Re Yossi Klein Halevi's "Christian Bias Against Israel Has a

<TE>   From what I can tell, the Palestinians inside the Church of the
Nativity invoked an ancient Christian tradition of sanctuary in
entering the church to seek escape from their persecutors.</TE>
<TE>   When Jews associate themselves with Israeli human rights abuses,
we can hardly be surprised that people around the world get angry.
Many of us don't support the occupation of Palestine and don't
support the suppression of the Palestinian people. Israeli leaders
like Sharon and, indeed, Halevi do not speak for us. We support those
in Israel who, like us, work for peace and an end to the occupation.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Memory and Destiny," by Lynn Cohen, Opinion, April 7: As a
Jew, I feel ill at ease, to say the least, when I hear comparisons
drawn between Hitler's reich and the Jewish state. But to see the
current Israeli government policy of self-defense likened to Hitler's
Gestapo tactics by a Jewish writer is downright nauseating. The logic
behind the claim that since our grandparents were tortured and
murdered by the Nazis, Israel has no right to defend itself as it
sees fit is spurious.</TE>
<TE>   If Cohen believes that by defending itself against terror Israel
is committing suicide, then perhaps she can offer some alternative
course of action. How about offering the Palestinians a state over
95% of the West Bank and Gaza? Oh wait, Israel tried that already.
Unfortunately, like most Americans, Cohen is quite out of touch with
the realities of the situation on the ground. I used to share her
belief in peace at all costs, that is, until I spent the last 18
months in Israel.</TE>

<TE>   Cohen's article expresses the outrage I feel. I am not Jewish; it

<TE>   I read Cohen's column with horror and then anger. She describes
Israeli soldiers engaging in "Gestapo-style" tactics. Cohen is
clearly ill-informed about Gestapo-style tactics. If the Israeli army
actually were using Gestapo-style tactics, all the Palestinians would
be dead, Arafat would not be giving interviews on television and
reporters would not be reporting. They too would be dead.</TE>

<TE>   The last thing the Middle East calamity needs now is more
fantasies, whether they are David Perlmutter's apocalyptic terrors

or--actually much more offensive because lacking any self-awareness
or humility--the vapid arrogance of Cohen, who somehow believes that
being a Conservative Jew, learning about the Holocaust and having an
utterly ethnocentric, romanticized fling with exotica by spending a
year in an elite area of Jerusalem and exchanging back-room "hungry
kisses" with a poor Arab entitle her to lecture us on Israel's
behavior.</TE>

themselves if they are willing to place their lives, and the lives of

send chills down one's back to ponder the fact that this man has his
finger on the button that could doom all mankind to a "nuclear
winter."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Harvey (Voices, March 30) wrote about dangerous dogs and the
L.A. County Department of Animal Care and Control's response to a
problem he had in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, at our department's request, the Board of Supervisors
adopted one of the toughest dangerous dog suppression ordinances in
California. Prior to this, the department could take action only if a
person was actually attacked and bitten by a dog. Now we can initiate
a case when dogs attack other dogs or if they menace and pose a
threat to people.</LD>
<LD>   Most animal control agencies in California hold in-house hearings
as a first step in dangerous dog cases and go to court only as a last
resort when the owners of dangerous or vicious dogs ignore or fail to
follow the administrative guidelines that come out of the hearings.
Under the ordinance, our department and the office of the county
counsel take every potentially dangerous or vicious dog case directly
to court for prosecution. We have won legally enforceable orders in
every case presented for trial and have never lost a potentially
dangerous dog case.</LD>
<TE>   Our agency impounds aggressive and menacing dogs, almost on a
daily basis, and we are fully aware of the danger they pose to people
and pets. We are preparing to go to court on several cases and will
continue to use the county's dangerous dog law as often as necessary
until everyone who owns these animals understands the risks the dogs
pose and thinks twice about the wisdom of keeping such an animal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On a few occasions recently I rode the Green Line from the
Aviation/Imperial station and transferred to the Blue Line to go
downtown and then returned home on the same route. After a few trips
I have come to the conclusion that future mass transit routes should
not be built down the center of a freeway. To stand in the middle of
a freeway on a small, crowded platform (like the Rosa Parks station),
waiting for the next light-rail carriages, subjects the rider to the
literally deafening noise from the freeway traffic, choking exhaust
from the cars and trucks and swirling debris created and stirred up
by the whirling traffic.</LD>
<LD>   The cumulative impact from standing on the freeway platforms for a
daily commute must surely adversely affect one's health. While the
Green Line is needed--and a step toward weaning the public from
cars--transit riders should never have to be subjected to the
conditions found in the transit stations located in the middle of a
freeway.</LD>

<LD>Before David Miranda (letter, April 4) lectures professor Erwin

the "three strikes" initiative, he should read it himself. He and
almost everyone else is unaware that a defendant can pick up two
strikes in one criminal prosecution, thereby subjecting himself to
draconian results on his second offense, which does not make him a
"habitual" criminal. It has taken the courts and case law to correct
this deceptive piece of legislation, which passed because Sacramento
refused to deal with the problem as it should have.</LD>

<LD>I was shocked to read in your April 4 article, "Europe Sees a
Tinderbox on Its Streets," that you characterized unprovoked assaults
against Jews and their places of worship as proxy fighting. Your
Orwellian use of language implies that somehow the Jews are to blame
for these racist assaults. However, there are no European Jews
fighting, no Jews burning mosques, only Muslims attacking and burning
synagogues to demonstrate their true intentions and beliefs.</LD>

<HD>Parks or No Parks, LAPD Needs Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD> Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at
USC, conducted an independent review of the LAPD Board of Inquiry's
report on the Rampart scandal for the Police Protective League.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The divisive debate over whether Chief Bernard Parks should be
reappointed has focused too much on personality and race and not
nearly enough on what remains to be done to reform the Los Angeles
Police Department. No matter who is the chief, many further reforms
of the LAPD are essential. As the Police Commission deliberates
Parks' fate, a key question must be whether he is the right person to
bring about these changes.</LD>
<LD>   Although the consent decree between the U.S. Justice Department
and the city contains many essential reforms, it is a compromise
document. Some needed improvements were not included because of
strong opposition from the city's negotiators.</LD>
<LD>   Among the crucial reforms needed is protection for
"whistle-blowers." Officers must be able to report wrongdoing by
others in the LAPD anonymously and without fear of being disciplined
for not having previously reported the misconduct. The Christopher
Commission report, a decade ago, said that the "code of silence"
within the LAPD was the single largest obstacle to an effective
disciplinary system.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the code of silence remains deeply entrenched in
the LAPD. The Police Department's own Board of Inquiry acknowledged
that the code of silence kept the Rampart Division scandal from being
exposed until Officer Rafael Perez was caught stealing cocaine from
the police evidence room and made a deal to protect himself.</TE>
<TE>   I have had officers describe to me very serious misconduct in
their divisions and ask me who they can tell and get a promise of
anonymity and immunity from discipline for not having come forward
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is no one; nobody has the authority to grant such
anonymity or immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Officers also have told me that if it were known that they had
revealed wrongdoing, they would fear their backs would be unprotected
the next time they were in trouble on the street. They say that they
are afraid that they would lose their badges for not reporting the
misconduct earlier. So it's clear that whistle-blower protection is
imperative to breaking the code of silence.</TE>
<TE>   Second, there must be reform of the Internal Affairs Division,
which is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct by
officers. Internal Affairs obviously is crucial to uncovering and
ultimately disciplining misconduct. Unfortunately, there has been no
examination and no reforms despite instances in which Internal
Affairs failed to adequately investigate misconduct in the Rampart
Division.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that there is high turnover in Internal
Affairs; officers on the way up in the department spend time in
Internal Affairs but want to leave quickly and tread lightly on those
who will again be their colleagues. The need to create civilian
oversight of Internal Affairs is obvious.</TE>
<TE>   Third, there is a need to strengthen the independence and role of
the inspector general. Katherine Mader and Jeffrey Eglash, the two
inspectors general since the Christopher Commission created the post,
have been frustrated by a lack of cooperation from police officials,
including being denied access to information.</TE>
<TE>   These reforms are essential, whether or not Parks is reappointed.
As the Police Commission deliberates over Parks' future, it must ask
whether Parks is the right person to implement these changes.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, for example, has strongly opposed granting anonymity or
immunity to officers reporting misconduct. Also, Parks, a former head
of Internal Affairs, never has acknowledged a need for reforms of
that division. And Parks has continually refused to cooperate with
the inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the pattern has been the same. A scandal is exposed
in the LAPD; reforms are proposed, some are adopted and others not.
The city goes on until the next scandal and the pattern repeats
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Another major scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department is
inevitable unless there are further reforms. Above all, the Police
Commission must act to further reform the LAPD, and it must decide
who is the right chief to make this happen.</TE>

<HD>Valley City: A Plum for Career Politicians</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Alarcon May Run for Mayor of Valley City," April 5: What a bunch
of turkeys these Valley VOTE people are. Did they really think that,
after all their efforts, they would lead the new Valley city; they
would be the mayor, the vice mayor, the city councilmen, the police
commissioners, et al.?</LD>
<LD>   We have a big plum here, and it attracts the heavy professionals
with the big bucks. If Valley cityhood passes, every politician out
of work because of term limits will be organizing his/her campaign,
and the people who did the grunt work, whether it was well intended
or not, will be pushed into obscurity. This is one of many reasons
why splitting up the city is a bad idea.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Richard Alarcon's (D-Sylmar) announcement should be a
wake-up call for residents of any Los Angeles neighborhood with an
eye to independence: Take this step, and you'll wind up with multiple
bureaucracies instead of one, led by people who are in it for a
life's career.</LD>
<TE>   If Los Angeles' geographical pockets want some real grass-roots
control of their local affairs and some real clout at City Hall, we
should be heading toward a borough system.</TE>

<TE>   Re "It's Right on the Tip of Their Tongues," April 3: As a very
happy resident of Encino, in the San Fernando Valley, for the past 46
years, I am appalled at the juvenile silliness of the supposed adults
who are "putting the cart before the horse" and picking their
favorite names for the new Valley city, on which there has not yet
even been a vote.</TE>
<TE>   If this represents, in any way, the mind-set of the people pushing
for an independent San Fernando Valley city, woe be unto all of us
who live and take pride in the Valley as an integral part of the city
of Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>The data on minority admissions at the University of California are
interesting indeed ("Minority Levels Rebound at UC," April 5). For
those of us who supported the dismantling of affirmative action and
endured taunts from the left that our motives were racist, these
statistics prove three things.</LD>
<LD>   * Minority students are just as capable and motivated as white
students. To support affirmative action essentially tells minorities
that we believe they are incapable of competing. Now who are the
racists in this picture?</LD>
<LD>   * If the dismantling of affirmative action was a right-wing,
racist plot, it failed. The proportion of new students who were white
dropped from 42.8% in 1997 to 39.8% in 2002. Please note that both
figures are below the proportion of whites in the California
population.</LD>

<HD>Broadcom to Acquire Mobilink</HD>
<DH>Technology: Irvine chip maker enters the mobile phone
market with the $190-million stock buy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcom Corp., the Orange County chip maker known for its aggressive
acquisition strategy, said Monday it plans to jump into the
cell-phone market with a $190-million stock purchase of privately
held Mobilink Telecom Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Mobilink designs chipsets and develops technical blueprints for a
variety of wireless devices, including mobile phones, personal
digital assistants and cellular modem cards.</LD>
<LD>   The company sells its software designs and products to many of the
major phone companies.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine-based Broadcom said it will issue about 5.6 million shares
to buy Santa Clara-based Mobilink. Broadcom also will take an
undetermined charge in the second quarter because of research and
development costs related to the acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to close before the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom also said it has set aside an additional 2 million shares
if Mobilink meets certain performance levels.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Mobilink Telecom, which was founded in 1996 and has 132 employees,
had revenue of about $13million last year, according to Chairman and
Chief Executive Tung Chang.</TE>
<TE>   No layoffs are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom, which was once the fastest-growing chip company and
known for acquiring 18 companies during a two-year period, has seen
its stock price slump as the high-tech boom has gone bust.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcom shares, which have declined about 7% this year, rose
$1.29 on Monday to close at $33.89 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Airline Service Is Better Than It Was a Year Ago, Survey
Says</HD>
<DH>Aviation: With fewer flights after Sept. 11, more planes
are on time and fewer bags are lost.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An annual survey released Monday confirmed what many travelers
already know: Airline service is better than a year ago because a lot
fewer planes are in the sky.</LD>
<LD>   More flights are on time, fewer bags are getting lost and
consumers' gripes are down, mainly because the airlines cut their
flights by 20% or more after Sept. 11 and gave the burdened U.S. air
traffic system some leeway, according to the report. However, it
noted that the carriers--which were excoriated in 1999-2000 for their
poor service and threatened with more federal oversight--had started
doing better even before the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge is whether the airlines can maintain that
improvement now that they're gradually adding back service and more
people are flying again, the survey's two authors said. "A focus on
the consumer must not be lost," said Brent Bowen, director of the
University of Nebraska at Omaha's Aviation Institute, who co-authored
the report with Dean Headley, associate marketing professor at
Wichita State University.</LD>
<TE>   Using a formula that weighs various quality criteria, the authors
found Alaska Airlines had the best service, followed by US Airways
and Northwest Airlines. Alaska, a unit of Alaska Air Group Inc., was
second last year behind Delta Air Lines, which finished fifth in the
latest survey. Ironically, all of the 11 major airlines scored higher
this year except Delta, according to the report, which also found
that America West was the most improved carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Although the airlines are adding back more flights, travel remains
10% below its year-ago levels. Business travel remains especially
weak, with the sluggish economy keeping many business travelers
grounded. The industry will be watching this summer's traffic as a
crucial test of how much air travel has returned to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the survey's findings included:</TE>
<TE>   * Flights were on time 77.4% of the time, up from 72.6% the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   * The Transportation Department received 2.11 complaints for every
100,000 passengers, down from 2.98 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * Airlines mishandled or lost 4.55 bags for every 1,000 bags
checked on flights, down from 5.29 bags the previous year.</TE>

<HD>Ameritrade to Acquire Rival Datek</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ameritrade Holding Corp. agreed Monday to buy rival Datek Online
Holdings Corp. for $1.3 billion in stock in a bid to become the
biggest Internet broker as measured by average daily trades.</LD>
<LD>   The deal comes as online trading continues to wane amid the stock
market's two-year slump. But Ameritrade said the combined company
stands to benefit from cost savings and an eventual recovery in
trading volume. Industrywide, online trading has plunged more than
50% from its peak in the first quarter of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The deal ends an intense bidding war for Datek, whose value was
estimated at $700 million by analysts this year when its private
owners put it up for auction. The combined company, with an average
of 164,000 trades a day, is expected to vault to a virtual tie with
industry leader Charles Schwab Corp. It would be fourth in number of
accounts at 2.7 million and in client assets at $43 billion.</LD>
<TE>   By valuing the average Datek account at $1,540, a hefty premium to
the industry average, Ameritrade outbid No. 2 online broker E-Trade
Group Inc. and several major banks, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, expected to close in three months, would give
Omaha-based Ameritrade a customer base twice as active as its own. In
the fourth quarter, for example, the average Datek customer made six
stock trades, versus three for the typical Ameritrade client.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the deal would help both companies survive by
increasing operating efficiency and easing competitive pressure. But
they said the combined company's ultimate success may hinge on
whether the online trading boom that accompanied the bull market of
the late 1990s ever returns.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Sterling, an analyst at Jupiter Research, noted that the
combined brokerage will have an average account size of less than
$16,000--about half the industry average--so it will depend on
commission volume to stay in the black. Both Ameritrade and Datek
offer low-cost Web trading for $10 or less.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers such as E-Trade that have diversified their business
models by opening branch offices and offering services such as
mortgages may have a better long-term strategy, Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   But Joe Moglia, chief executive of Ameritrade, said his company
would have the operating leverage to thrive when stock trading gains
steam again.</TE>
<TE>   "In a diversified model you have more liability on the balance
sheet, greater fixed costs and all kinds of regulatory issues,"
Moglia said. "We're more of a pure play, which gives us greater
operating leverage on the upside. We know what we are and we know
what works for us."</TE>
<TE>   Executives from the private consortium that owns Datek agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had sold out to a bank we would not be able to fully
participate in the upside to come," said Kevin Landry, managing
director of Boston-based private equity investor TA Associates, part
of the consortium that also includes Bain Capital Inc., Advent
International and Silver Lake Partners. The firms bought Datek in
December 2000 for an estimated $700 million after its controversial
CEO quit and the firm settled charges with the SEC over its trading
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Repetto, analyst at Putnam Lovell Securities Inc., called
the new company "essentially a 'double-down bet' on online retail
trading." Though the near-term outlook for Web trading remains soft,
he said the strategy could prove to be a success.</TE>
<TE>   "The three leaders are differentiating themselves," Repetto said.
"Schwab is going after the affluent investor, E-Trade is offering a
diversified suite of financial services and now Ameritrade is
catering to the highly active trader."</TE>
<TE>   Though total online trading accounts in the U.S. are expected to
grow from 20 million today to more than 50 million by the end of
2005, Sterling said, most of the new customers are likely to be
so-called light traders, who make fewer than 20 trades a year. Many
will be existing brokerage customers simply signing up for online
access.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be the self-directed trading cowboys preferred
by online discount brokers," he said, because that crowd already has
opened Web accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Ameritrade rose 12 cents to $6.42 on Nasdaq. The stock has rallied
62% in the last year on hopes for an improved business climate.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Makes It Official: 7,000 Layoffs</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Some blame decision by Justice Department to
indict the entire company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH and ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staggering from the damage done by its role in the collapse of Enron
Corp. and a subsequent criminal indictment, accounting firm Andersen
announced Monday that it will fire 7,000 workers, or 27% of its
staff.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen, the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm, said the
staff reduction will conserve cash as it struggles to become a
smaller, audit-focused firm.</LD>
<LD>   A criminal indictment last month on an obstruction-of-justice
charge from the destruction of documents related to the Enron
collapse has crippled Andersen. The firm is fighting the indictment
and the case is set for trial May 6.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, Andersen has lost more than 140 of the large
public company clients that make up the bread and butter of its
business.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm served as both a consultant and auditor for
Enron and has been linked to Enron's strategy of hiding billions of
dollars of debt and hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in a
series of secretive partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the issues we have confronted recently, none compare to
actions we are now forced to take with our employees," Larry Gorrell,
managing partner of U.S. operations, said in a statement Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Several employees blamed the massive layoff on the Justice
Department's strategy to indict the entire firm rather than just the
Andersen employees who destroyed documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I am extremely upset and worried because my government betrayed
me," said Susan Casillas, a tax manager in the Los Angeles office who
is waiting to learn whether she will keep her job. "My government is
putting all of us out of business and won't look at the real
culprits."</TE>
<TE>   Although the firm did not provide a breakdown, the job losses were
expected to be especially steep at its Chicago headquarters and
elsewhere in Illinois, where the firm has more than 5,000 workers. It
wasn't known how many of the layoffs will be in the firm's L.A.--area
offices, which include Irvine, Woodland Hills and downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's layoffs are only the first round," said Richard Ossoff,
publisher of Auditor-Trak, a service of Atlanta-based Strafford
Publications. "The rapidly shrinking audit practice cannot support
the remaining infrastructure and this will accelerate pressure to cut
expenses even more quickly and aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost 144 of its 2,300 U.S public company clients
since the start of the year, Ossoff said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this pace of defections is not quickly reduced, the Andersen
audit practice may not be sustainable," Ossoff said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which has 26,000 employees in the United States, started
firing workers Monday but said the full layoff will occur over the
next several months.</TE>
<TE>   Employees will be kept on the payroll for one week for every year
of service with the firm, said Grover Wray, Andersen's U.S. human
resources chief. During that period, the staffers will have access to
their offices and computers and will receive health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people have been loyal professionals during this very
difficult time and we want to treat them with respect," Wray said.</TE>
<TE>   The big city offices that have suffered the most client defections
will have the most layoffs, he said. The job reduction also will be
concentrated in its audit practice and in administrative services.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not upset, I am sad," said Brian Dyer, who works in
marketing at the Los Angeles office. Dyer said he has respect for the
firm, but is worried about the job market.</TE>
<TE>   Many Andersen workers in Los Angeles are waiting to learn of their
status. But they are not waiting to start looking for new work.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sending out resumes and making calls," said Elliott
Parker, a senior consultant in Andersen's downtown L.A. office.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts don't affect Andersen's overseas offices, which are
separate partnerships that operate independently. Those offices are
arranging business combinations with rival firms.</TE>
<TE>   Clerical and administrative staff who were let go Monday will have
the most trouble finding work, said Allan Koltin, chief executive of
Practice Development Institute, an accounting industry consulting
firm in Chicago. They are walking into a job market that by most
estimates is either at the end of a mild recession or at the start of
a slow recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Specialists--professionals who intimately know a specific industry
or those who have a specialty practice such as state and federal
income taxes--will have the easiest time finding a new position,
Koltin said. But general auditors could face a lengthy job search
unless they apply to a firm that has picked off a former Andersen
client with which they have been involved.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can call and say that you worked on one of their new
clients, that will get your foot in the door," Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen workers who get job offers probably will have to settle
for smaller salaries. Koltin said Andersen paid more than other
firms. An Andersen manager--the level just below partner--earns
$75,000 to $125,000. Other firms, especially the second-tier
companies, pay $60,000 to $100,000 for the same position, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the layoffs, Andersen was shrinking its work force.
The firm has an agreement to divest about half of its tax
practice--roughly $500 million to $600 million in business--to rival
Deloitte &amp; Touche. It also has a memorandum to sell some of its
offices in the Pacific Northwest to KPMG. Andersen had $4.3billion in
U.S. revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker has taken control
of Andersen in an effort to bring the government to the negotiating
table to find a way to rescue the firm. Talks were held Friday, but
no progress was reported. And many accounting industry experts
believe that the firm will be absorbed piecemeal by other Big Five
firms and the larger of the second-tier accounting businesses.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Growth Properties Inc., the second-largest U.S. shopping mall
owner, agreed to buy Victoria Ward Ltd. to expand its holdings of
Hawaiian retail properties.</LD>

<LD>   The purchase plan comes a month after General Growth said it had
agreed to buy shopping mall owner JP Realty Inc. for $1.1 billion,
adding 18 malls in eight states in the West. General Growth already
owns Ala Moana shopping Center in Honolulu, which it bought in 1999
for $810 million.</LD>
<TE>   General Growth is controlled by the Bucksbaum family, which owns
141 shopping malls with 125 million square feet of space.</TE>
<TE>   General Growth shares rose 7 cents to $45.86 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The announcement was made after the close of trading.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>National retailers Target Corp. and Kohl's Corp. and regional chain
Chick's Sporting Goods have signed letters of intent to open stores
at the $200-million Colonies Crossroads, a 1-million-square-foot
shopping center on 110 acres in Upland at Campus Avenue and the
Foothill Freeway extension that is scheduled for completion in
October.</LD>
<LD>   The new stores are expected to open soon after the center is
completed in summer 2003, said Bob Lewis, partner of Pacific
Development Group of Newport Beach, which expects to begin
construction of the shopping center in October in a joint venture
with Colonies Crossroads Inc. of Rancho Cucamonga.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the individual leases were not disclosed, but Lewis said
the aggregate value of the three deals was about $35 million.</LD>
<TE>   The shopping center will be developed as part of The Colonies at
San Antonio, a 434-acre master-planned community including 1,100
homes, 305 of which are under construction by KB Homes and Standard
Pacific.</TE>

but perhaps no one has recovered as quickly as Bruce G. Willison,
dean of UCLA's graduate business school.</LD>
<LD>   Monday morning, Willison was named as a defendant in the expanded
lawsuit filed by the University of California Board of Regents to
recover billions lost by investors in the collapse of Enron. The
dean, who served on Enron's board from August 1997 to December 1998,
was among 10 Enron directors from the late 1990s included in the new
court complaint.</LD>
<LD>   Willison and other directors were cited for signing a stock
offering document that included Enron's 1997 financial
results--information that, UC lawyers say, misled investors by hiding
the company's financial problems. That placed Willison in the awkward
position of being sued by his own employer, the UC system.</LD>
<TE>   But by the end of the business day, UC's lawyers concluded that
they couldn't sue Willison. The reason: The statute of limitations
for the case limited the suit to activities dating back to June
1999--which was half a year after Willison had left Enron's board.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be talking with him shortly, and advising him that we'll be
providing him with a dismissal," said James E. Holst, general counsel
for the UC system.</TE>
<TE>   Holst, acknowledging that a call from a Times reporter prompted
UC's outside lawyers to look into the Willison matter, added: "I'd
like to think we would have gotten to this point quickly, but perhaps
not as quickly."</TE>
<TE>   UC lawyers said the dean was included in the suit on narrow legal
grounds and was not going to be accused of fraud because there was no
evidence of intentional wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Willison declined to comment after news broke that he would be
named in the suit.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Andersen Executive to Plead Guilty</HD>
<DH>Probe: Duncan agrees to a deal in obstruction case and will
help Justice Department in Enron inquiry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>David B. Duncan, the former Andersen accounting executive who oversaw
the auditing of Enron Corp., has reached a deal to plead guilty to
obstruction of justice in connection with the shredding of documents
and is expected to enter a formal plea today, a government official
close to the case said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan's plea, once finalized, promises the Justice Department a
critical boost in its efforts to develop possible fraud and
conspiracy charges against Enron and its top executives.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan has emerged as a pivotal figure in the federal probe of
document destruction at Andersen, which was Enron's auditor. During
Duncan's tenure, Andersen employees allegedly shredded numerous
documents that could have shed light on Enron's business activities.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Houston at
2 p.m. today for a hearing before Judge Melinda Harmon, at which time
he will enter a plea of guilty to obstruction charges, according to
the official, who asked not to be identified. The plea deal is still
pending.</TE>
<TE>   The key aspect of the deal from the government's perspective was
Duncan's agreement to give full cooperation in the Justice
Department's Enron investigation, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan would be the first person known to have reached a plea deal
in the Enron scandal, and prosecutors will be looking to him to
provide a road map to the complex, off-the-books business
arrangements that allowed Enron to effectively hide hundreds of
millions of dollars in losses from its shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is negotiating separately with the Justice Department to
resolve obstruction-of-justice charges brought against the firm in an
indictment last month. The company's top lawyer met with the Justice
Department last week to discuss a possible settlement, but sources
said no deal is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen fired Duncan in January in a move that many litigators
saw as an attempt to pin the problems arising from the Enron audit on
him. At the time, Andersen said Duncan organized the effort by its
Houston office to destroy thousands of documents after learning of an
inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Duncan's firing, Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's
managing partner at the time, said, "Based on our actions today, it
should be perfectly clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical
behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful violation of our
policies."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan later defended his actions saying that he was following the
advice of Nancy Temple, an in-house attorney at Andersen's
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Temple was asked about her instructions to Duncan during a March
deposition in the class-action lawsuit filed by the University of
California regents and other plaintiffs against Andersen and Enron's
senior management.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to answer any questions, citing her 5th Amendment
right to keep silent 138 times.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts saw Andersen's strident stance against Duncan
as an odd strategy. They said that typically, accounting firms facing
probes and litigation place the partner who headed the problem audit
"on ice" while the matter sorts out.</TE>
<TE>   They don't allow the individual to do more audits, but they don't
fire the person, because they want the partner to testify on the
firm's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Lynn Turner, the former chief accountant for the
Securities and Exchange Commission, predicted the day Andersen fired
Duncan that he would become a witness for the government.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Credibility Hit Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's image suffered a fresh blow Monday as a pair of court
filings raised new questions about the credibility of major
investment banks and the advice they give investors.</LD>
<LD>   In a surprise legal action, the New York state attorney general,
alleging severe conflicts of interest at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s
Internet-research operation in recent years, asked a judge to order
the company to begin disclosing new information about the interaction
between the firm's investment-banking and stock-research units.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney general described the request as an initial salvo in
a wider investigation of Wall Street practices.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, Enron Corp. shareholders who lost billions of dollars
charged that the company's investment banks played a central role in
the firm's downfall by creating many of the off-the-books
partnerships that fed its collapse. The allegations, which were
reported Monday in The Times, were included in an expanded
class-action suit filed in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   In the Merrill case, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said a
10-month investigation of the brokerage's Internet-research group
discovered that Merrill analysts routinely questioned the validity of
their own stock recommendations and, in some cases, bemoaned the
pressure they felt to talk up the prospects of companies that were
investment banking clients.</TE>
<TE>   In one example, an analyst labeled tech firm InfoSpace Inc. "a
piece of junk" in an e-mail, but nevertheless gave the stock
Merrill's highest rating, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   "Merrill Lynch failed to disclose to the public that Merrill
Lynch's [stock] ratings were tarnished by an undisclosed conflict of
interest," Eric Dinallo, New York's assistant attorney general, wrote
in the court filing. "The research analysts were acting as
quasi-investment bankers for the companies at issue, often
initiating, continuing and/or manipulating research coverage for the
purpose of keeping and attracting investment banking clients."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general did not file suit against Merrill, but rather
asked a state Supreme Court judge to order the firm to increase
disclosure about its relationships with clients "and provide more
context for its stock ratings" while the state's investigation
proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   The judge agreed, but gave Merrill 72 hours to comply.</TE>
<TE>   In the statement, Merrill said the charges are "just plain wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations reveal a fundamental lack of understanding of how
securities research works," the firm said, and pointed out that its
top Internet analyst "repeatedly and publicly warned that a
substantial majority" of Internet companies would fail.</TE>
<TE>   One of those named in the New York case is Henry Blodget, who was
one of Merrill's highest-profile Internet analysts during the tech
sector's boom years.</TE>
<TE>   In the Enron suit Monday, plaintiffs named nine investment banks,
including Merrill, and two law firms to a previously filed
class-action complaint that had named Enron executives and accounting
firm Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that investment banks deliberately structured a
series of sham transactions that let Enron mask its deteriorating
financial condition from investors. In some cases, Wall Street
executives profited personally even as public investors and employees
suffered debilitating losses, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the brokerages knew Enron's health was failing, the suit
says, they continued to tout the company's stock to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The investment banks deny the charges. Salomon Smith Barney, a
unit of Citigroup Inc., said the company incurred severe losses in
loans made to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "It defies all logic to say we profited from our relationship with
Enron when we already announced Enron-related exposure of $2.6
billion and actual losses of $453 million," said Kristin Lemkau, a
spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Chase. "We were damaged as well."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the Merrill case and the Enron suit will reignite the
debate about Wall Street's credibility--an issue that flared after
stocks crashed in 2000. Congress last year launched a series of
hearings on brokerages' potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "One theme common to both is what [the firms] privately think and
what is told to the public," said Henry Hu, a securities-law expert
at the University of Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the Enron suit is an attempt to target well-heeled
Wall Street firms now that Andersen's ability to pay sizable
reparations is in doubt because of its precarious financial state.</TE>
<TE>   In the Merrill matter, the New York attorney general said his
office has reviewed more than 30,000 documents, including thousands
of e-mails. He said some e-mails indicated that the company's
Internet analysts often recommended shares to investors only to lure
lucrative investment banking work that would boost their pay.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, an analyst wrote an e-mail saying there was nothing
interesting about the stock "except banking fees."</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, an analyst bemoaned giving a "buy" rating to
a stock, stating, "I don't think it is the right thing to do. John
and Mary Smith are losing their retirement because we don't want the
client's CEO to be mad at us."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases analysts allowed companies to "redraft" research
reports and "indicate which ratings would be acceptable to them," the
filing says.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Names 3 to Board</HD>
<DH>Telecom: New directors will sit on a special committee
formed to investigate allegations by a former vice president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., which has gone through several dozen directors
in three years, appointed three new board members Monday and put them
on key committees as the troubled fiber-optic network operator tries
to shore up confidence amid federal investigations into its
accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   The new directors--Jeremiah D. Lambert, Alice T. Kane and Myron E.
"Mike" Ullman III--will sit on a special committee formed to
investigate allegations by a former vice president that the company
inflated revenue from sales of network capacity. Global filed the
fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in late January.</LD>
<LD>   "They do need independence on that board," said Peter Gleason,
vice president of research at the National Assn. of Corporate
Directors. "When a company is in Chapter 11, management has to seek
the expertise of the board and use its knowledge to get through it,
if they are going to get through it."</LD>
<TE>   The three have experience in areas needed to help guide Global's
restructuring and probable sale, and have joined three board
committees overseeing major issues that have plagued the company.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert, a Washington lawyer who specializes in energy law, will
chair the board's audit committee and its special independent
committee looking into inflated revenue allegations. Federal
regulatory and congressional investigators also are probing the
company's accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Ullman, now retired in San Francisco, is a former chairman and
chief executive of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and was one of several executives
approached in 1995 to run Kmart Corp., which went into bankruptcy
protection a week before Global Crossing. More recently, he was
managing director of luxury-goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton.</TE>
<TE>   Kane, a Short Hills, N.J., consultant for such investment banking
firms as Blaylock &amp; Partners, will chair the board's compensation
committee. The new directors already have their hands full on pay
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Since reorganizing its board last fall, Global has lost five
directors including three who left the Bermuda-based company since
the Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The latest was former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who
stepped down March 19 because of personal time constraints. His
departure came after a valuable and prestigious defense contract won
by Global was pulled back and rebid. The contract, awarded to
WorldCom Inc. last week, is worth up to $450 million.</TE>
<TE>   The new directors increase the size of the Global board to eight,
including four outside directors. Unlike most of Global's previous
outside directors, none of the ones named Monday had prior dealings
with Global or its top executives, said company spokeswoman Karen
Price.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Global--known for its high salaries and lavish
spending--asked the Bankruptcy Court to approve a re-arranged
employment contract with its chief executive, John Legere.</TE>
<TE>   The package amounts to as much as $10.9 million, including salary,
a possible bonus and "tax indemnification."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new agreement, Legere's annual salary would remain $1.1
million, with a 30% reduction to $770,000 during the company's
restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Legere would be eligible for an annual bonus equal to
$1.375 million if he meets performance goals set by the Global
Crossing creditors' committee.</TE>

and Associated Press was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>Harassment Verdict Prompts Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A record $30.6-million jury award for six women in their sexual
harassment case against Ralphs Grocery Co. sent shock waves through
California's business community Monday and prompted workplace experts
to predict a spike in similar lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Calling Friday's award a "whopper of a verdict," California
Chamber of Commerce Vice President Fred Main said the size of the
award would push business managers to review their sexual harassment
policies and to brace for an increase in complaints.</LD>
<LD>   Others said it might give pause to businesses considering locating
in California. The award was far larger than any previous jury
verdict in a sexual harassment case, surpassing a $7.1-million
judgment--subsequently reduced to $3.7 million by a judge--in 1994 to
a secretary at a law firm in California.</LD>
<TE>   "Employment litigation is the fastest-growing area of litigation
in the state," Main said. "A verdict like this really reinforces the
lottery aspect of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Workplace consultant David J. Bowman said most employers offer
sexual harassment awareness training once or twice a year, but the
Ralphs verdict suggests they ought to make it part of new-employee
orientation to ensure that everyone gets the message at least once.</TE>
<TE>   "If management doesn't get the point, the courts are significantly
going to curtail the stockholders' dividend checks," said Bowman, of
TTG Consulting in Los Angeles. "These juries are really going after
employers who thumb their nose at the law."</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs--a division of Kroger Co., the nation's largest supermarket
chain--was disappointed with the verdict and is considering its
options, including appeal, said spokesman Terry O'Neil. He declined
to comment further on the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   In the case, a San Diego County jury awarded each woman $5 million
in punitive damages and a total of $550,000 for pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence supported the award, said Philip Kay, the San
Francisco lawyer who represented the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The women--four cashiers, a bookkeeper and a bakery department
manager--accused the supermarket chain of covering up years of
abusive language and violent behavior toward them by a store
director, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   The women alleged that when they complained, they were transferred
to other stores, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Jury foreman John Adair said jurors struggled to figure out how to
punish and deter a company that they were told had a net worth of
$3.7 billion. He said he proposed awarding each woman 1% of Ralphs'
net worth, or a total of $222 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We scolded them," Adair said of the $30.6-million verdict.
"Ralphs could have stopped this at any time along the way. That's why
they are being punished. They chose to ignore it."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate lawyer Rick Albert said he has come to expect that kind
of outrage from juries, particularly in California.</TE>
<TE>   "Juries get extremely upset when they feel an employer has been
put on notice of inappropriate conduct and doesn't do what it needs
to do to make it stop," Albert said.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, which is followed by more than 40 states,
employers who promptly address complaints can mitigate damage awards
in sexual harassment cases.</TE>
<TE>   But last year, a state appellate court ruled that California law
did not allow employers to point to remedial action as a defense
against corporate liability. The state Supreme Court has agreed to
take up the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Bowman said, he recommends employers establish a
policy against sexual harassment, promote a complaint process and
conduct ongoing training.</TE>
<TE>   Another important aspect of California's law is the absence of
limits on the size of damage awards in employment discrimination
cases, including sexual harassment, said Noel Ragsdale, a USC law
professor. States that follow federal law have a $300,000
per-plaintiff cap on damages in sexual harassment suits.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had these six people, they probably could not have
recovered more than about $2 million" in another state, said Joseph
Beachboard, a lawyer and publisher of the California Employment Law
Letter.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time one of these big verdicts comes out, California loses
jobs," he said. "Employers read about these cases and start doing
their own cost-benefit analyses. The rules are so different here in
California, I think more and more employers will say, 'We'll just do
it elsewhere.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Chamber of Commerce's Main said he suspected business managers
already were calling human resources directors saying, "This better
not happen to us."</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs operates more than 450 stores under Ralphs, Food4Less and
other brands out of its Los Angeles headquarters. Kroger acquired
Ralphs in 1999 when it bought Fred Meyer Inc. Fred Meyer acquired
Ralphs a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Hotels See Room in Market for Luxury at Lower Rates</HD>

<LD>As the travel business struggles to get back on its feet, two new
high-end hotels in Burbank and Santa Monica plan to overcome a
challenging environment by offering chic accommodations at rates
attractive to price-conscious business travelers and tourists.</LD>
<LD>   The $20-million Graciela Burbank, which opens Wednesday, and
Viceroy Hotel, a $42-million project scheduled to debut this summer,
will cater primarily to business travelers in the entertainment,
advertising and related industries.</LD>
<LD>   The Graciela Burbank touts its proximity to a cluster of studios,
including Warner Bros., Disney and KNBC, in the eastern San Fernando
Valley. The 170-room Viceroy will sit near the ocean amid the
restaurants and amenities of Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   But the hoteliers, mindful of a weak economy, are eager to offer
their guests a good deal as well as luxury accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   "We have priced ourselves below some of the highest-priced
hotels," said Brad Korzen, chief executive of Los Angeles-based KOR
Group, which will charge an average of $225 a night for a room at the
Viceroy. The former Pacific Shore Hotel at Pico Boulevard and Ocean
Avenue is being renovated by Taisei Construction.</TE>
<TE>   At the 101-room Graciela Burbank, on Pass Avenue near Alameda
Avenue, the $155 average room rate is higher than those at most
nearby properties but below the rates found at comparable hotels in
other parts of Los Angeles, said hotel manager Jerome Strack.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at hotels on the Westside, a lot of their business
comes from Burbank," Strack said. "The hotel was built so they don't
have to go over the hill and through the canyons to get to
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Although those in the entertainment industry are known for paying
a premium for hotels and airfare, even Hollywood studios are looking
for bargains these days.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the cost cutting in the industry, a lot of people are
cost- conscious," said Robert Zarnegin, who developed the Graciela
Burbank as well as the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel industry observers say the outlook for both properties is
promising given the industry's ongoing recovery and relatively little
construction in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's hotel occupancy rate this year will rise to about
75% after falling to a dismal 68.4% at the end of 2001, according to
PKF Consulting.</TE>
<TE>   In the Burbank area, the vacancy rate, which did not suffer much
of a drop last year, will remain relatively steady at 71%.</TE>
<TE>   "They are both in pretty strong markets," said Bruce Baltin, a
lodging industry specialist at PKF Consulting.</TE>

<HD>Bellwether IBM Warns of Earnings Shortfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology giant IBM Corp. warned Monday that it expects to post
first-quarter earnings significantly below Wall Street's
expectations--a sign that the technology recession is far from over.</LD>
<LD>   The bellwether technology firm said sales of semiconductors and
storage drives were hit hard by lagging demand. IBM's services and
personal computer revenue also suffered, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The rare profit warning--IBM's first since 1991--follows similar
red flags from a host of software companies last week and Monday and
suggests to analysts that there are still other shoes to drop.</LD>
<TE>   "The tech segment is clearly not recovering yet," said Rob
Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group. The question, he
said, is, "will the recovery be in 2003 or 2004?"</TE>
<TE>   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM estimated earnings of 66 cents to 70 cents
a share for the quarter ended March 30, on revenue of $18.4 billion
to $18.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations of profit of 85
cents on revenue of $19.7 billion. IBM is expected to report
first-quarter earnings April 17.</TE>
<TE>   The severity of the shortfall stunned investors. IBM stock fell
$9.84, or 10%, to $87.41 on the New York Stock Exchange, the lowest
closing price since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Spending on hardware and software support services--including
costly sales management systems and supply chain software
development--fell 3% in the U.S. last year, and is not recovering
quickly, according to market analyst group IDC. Such projects may
cost millions of dollars and take more than a year to complete.</TE>
<TE>   Outsourcing services--for managing corporate computer networks or
Web sites--have fared better, IDC analyst Rebecca Segal said. But the
strength of outsourcing reflects a trend of companies cutting back on
internal technology purchases and hiring.</TE>
<TE>   Last year PC revenues declined for the first time in more than a
decade. That trend will continue this year, according to IDC,
pressuring big computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., already
suffering from uncertainty generated by its ongoing battle to acquire
Compaq Computer Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq said Monday that it would meet analyst projections for a
1-cent-per-share profit in the last quarter, down from 12 cents a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Overall corporate spending on new technology products, including
server computers that manage networks and telecommunications
equipment, also is down sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "All [companies] overspent in the late '90s, especially for the
year 2000, and the corporate sector will have a slow, arduous
recovery," said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts said that other factors also may be contributing to
the severity of the IBM warning. The Enron Corp. scandal and
increased scrutiny of corporate earnings statements by the Securities
and Exchange Commission is making companies more conservative in
their financial explanations.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically IBM has been known to stretch" to meet analysts'
projections, said Ashok Kumar, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst.
That will be much harder to do in the current climate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Palmisano, who became IBM's chief executive on March 1, may
want to reset analysts' perceptions so he can more easily show strong
earnings growth going forward, said Harvard business professor Henry
Chesbrough. "When [Lou] Gerstner became CEO in early 1993, IBM took
the largest write-off in its history," Chesbrough said. "There was a
big lowering of expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the underlying problem for technology providers
involves a lack of compelling products to create a new cycle of
demand. Two traditional stimuli for growth--a new operating system
from Microsoft Corp. and a new generation of chips from Intel
Corp.--are more than a year away.</TE>
<TE>   Chesbrough warned that when the industry regains its footing, some
established players may be in for a rude awakening. "What has helped
the tech sector in the U.S. in the last 10 to 15 years has primarily
been a wealth of start-ups creating new markets and disrupting
established markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that today's tech giants have two alternatives: "Innovate
or stagnate."</TE>

<HD>Kirch's Core Holdings Seek Creditor Protection</HD>
<DH>Media: The television and rights-trading units of the
German company declare insolvency. Their stakes include the rights to
broadcast World Cup soccer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Media mogul Leo Kirch's core television and rights-trading businesses
filed for protection from creditors Monday, heralding the biggest
bankruptcy in post-World War II Germany and rocking national
institutions from the chancellery to the Bundesliga soccer league.</LD>
<LD>   With a legal declaration of insolvency for KirchMedia and
KirchPayTV, the main holdings of Kirch Group, the 75-year-old founder
bowed out of his namesake empire after more than 40 years as one of
this country's most spectacular rags-to-riches stories.</LD>
<LD>   Kirch's media holdings collapsed under a load of debt, about $1.2
billion of the $5.7 billion owed from all of his enterprises. The
debt includes $352 million owed to Hollywood studios for film rights.</LD>
<TE>   A Bavarian farm boy whose first rights deal was negotiated in his
car, Kirch built Germany's No. 2 media conglomerate from scratch and
was for decades a major influence on conservative politicians,
including his close friend and former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</TE>
<TE>   With Kirch now out of the picture, creditors announced the
formation of a three-man receivership charged with preventing a
full-scale breakup of the holding company and sale of its assets to
foreign rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, who is challenging Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder for the leadership in the Sept. 22 federal
elections, vowed to see the main media operations continue and as
many of the group's 10,000 jobs preserved as possible.</TE>
<TE>   But Stoiber was inundated with criticism from political opponents
for allowing a Munich-based bank, half-owned by his state government,
to extend poorly secured loans to the privately held company whose
financial plight has been known for years.</TE>
<TE>   The bank, Bayerische Landesbank, is the most exposed of Kirch's
many creditors, holding $1.7 billion of the group's $5.7-billion
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Several other bankruptcies and loan defaults over the last year
have hit the bank hard and exposed Stoiber's government to
accusations of cronyism.</TE>
<TE>   The state bank, along with three other major
creditors--Commerzbank, DZ Bank and HVB Group-- appointed the
restructuring team shortly after the insolvency filing and announced
a search for new investors with media expertise to manage the
profitable Kirch companies once they are spun off from the
unsalvageable assets.</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia includes a controlling 52.5% stake in Germany's leading
broadcaster, ProSiebenSat1, as well as Europe's biggest film and
television library and exclusive rights to broadcast World Cup
soccer. Other Kirch holdings include rights to broadcast Formula One
auto racing and a 40% stake in Axel Springer Verlag, publisher of
Germany's largest circulation newspaper, Bild.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch also owns broadcasting rights to the Bundesliga, and his
$350-million annual payment provides as much as half of the teams'
income and much of their ability to pay lavish salaries for top
players.</TE>
<TE>   With the soccer teams' solvency threatened by Kirch's collapse,
the federal government last week said it was considering making as
much as $180 million in bridge credits available to the Bundesliga, a
move criticized by economists as a misuse of taxpayer funds to
appease sports fans in an election year.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Munich after the insolvency filings,
officials of the main creditor banks announced the appointment of
Kirch lawyers Wolfgang van Betteray and Hans-Joachim Ziems along with
local court officer Michael Jaffe as receivership administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The insolvency team will draft a restructuring plan for Kirch in
consultation with the creditors, who include foreign media rivals
Rupert Murdoch of Australia and Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi as well as Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., Hollywood studios,
Credit Suisse Group and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The new administrators, who take over from Kirch and Deputy Chief
Executive Dieter Hahn, said they will seek new investors and
encourage those already holding Kirch debt to provide interim funding
in exchange for shares in a media group they hope to found.</TE>
<TE>   Axel Springer was reported by German media to be agreeable to the
restructuring attempt and will hold off activating a "put" option
that would require Kirch to pay the publisher $669 million. Other
major creditors such as Deutsche Bank, which had called due a
$400-million loan, also indicated to the receivership team that they
would be patient for a while longer.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch had been in talks with Murdoch, Berlusconi and the Hollywood
studios he owes $435million, but those negotiations collapsed last
week after months of unsuccessful efforts to craft a rescue plan.</TE>
<TE>   Betteray met with creditors to discuss how best to redeem the
value of surviving assets, most notably the World Cup broadcasting
rights that could revert to the sport's governing body in the event
of bankruptcy. The TV rights for the games this summer in Japan and
South Korea, as well as those for the 2006 World Cup, are being
transferred to a Switzerland-based Kirch enterprise to shield them
from rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch's biggest creditor is Bayerische Landesbank, half-owned by
the state of Bavaria and already reeling from massive loan defaults
by other insolvent companies such as construction giant Philipp
Holzmann and Fairchild Dornier, the world's third-largest
manufacturer of short-haul aircraft that filed for protection from
creditors last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Bavarian bank's poorly secured loans to Kirch may damage
Stoiber's chances of unseating Schroeder as they suggest bad economic
judgment and undermine his portrayal of his state as more modern and
better managed than the nation as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk analysis of these loans was questionable and must be
investigated," Schroeder told journalists after a meeting here with
leaders of his Social Democratic Party. He accused Bavarian
politicians and bankers of incompetence and indecency in exposing the
state to a business empire built on a mountain of debt and dubious
investments.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber defended his government's support of Kirch during troubled
times, saying the entrepreneur has created "the most important
magnet" for the development of Munich into one of Germany's leading
media centers, where more than 100,000 are employed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kirch's collapse is a major embarrassment for Stoiber,
who goes to Washington this week for an official visit, it also is
unlikely to leave Schroeder unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment has soared above the psychologically important
barriers of 10% and 4million people, and additional job losses
incurred by Kirch will worsen the chancellor's economic report card
as voters ponder their future from the depths of a recession.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch's empire has survived for years on last-ditch
reorganizations and strategic asset disposals, but the accelerating
financial hemorrhage from his Premiere pay-TV operation and an
advertising slump imposed by the recession brought the reclusive
Bavarian to ruin.</TE>
<TE>   Premiere lost nearly $800 million last year and has fallen far
short of company forecasts of 4million subscribers by now, with only
2.4 million willing to shell out for sports and movie channels in a
country in which more than 30 channels are free.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch founded his company in 1959, when he acquired the rights to
Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini's "La Strada" during a
Mediterranean car trip and sold them to German television stations.
KirchMedia's library now contains more than 15,000 hours of film and
TV programming, but the hefty sums Kirch paid in recent years to
acquire and replenish Hollywood products are among the expenditures
that mired him in debt.</TE>
<TE>   It was a missed $132-million payment to Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Tri-Star last month that set in motion the legally mandated
insolvency process.</TE>
<TE>   Germany now is Europe's biggest market, and its media outlets are
domestically owned despite a lack of legal limits on foreign
influence.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber and other politicians engaged in the insolvency process
have called for national control of the Kirch assets to be spun off
to prevent their acquisition by Murdoch, Berlusconi or other foreign
magnates interested in gaining a larger stake of the German market.</TE>

<HD>Levi Strauss to Close 6 Plants, Cut Staff</HD>
<DH>Apparel: The jeans maker will lay off 3,300 workers as it
halts almost all of its U.S. manufacturing sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Levi Strauss &amp; Co., an apparel icon suffering declining sales for the
last five years, said Monday it will close six U.S. plants and
dismiss 3,300 workers this year as it halts almost all of its U.S.
manufacturing operations.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Levi said the closures will help the company
"maintain strong margins" and invest more of its resources in product
development, marketing and retail initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in the midst of a business turnaround, but this is a shift
that would be happening regardless of sales," spokeswoman Linda
Butler said.</LD>
<TE>   Levi is one of a growing number of apparel companies that have
chosen to move manufacturing outside the U.S. to cut costs over the
last five years. Between 70% and 80% of all clothing purchased here
is sewn outside the U.S., industry experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "What's driving all this is American consumers' demand for
affordable clothing," said Erik Autor, vice president of the National
Retail Federation's International Trade Counsel. "There's a
tremendous amount of price pressure on retailers to give their
customers the best value they can on clothing. That ripples down the
supply chain to apparel and fabric manufacturers, yarn spinners and
fiber producers."</TE>
<TE>   For Levi, the announcement is part of a major restructuring that
began in 1999. After a few earlier closures, the company began
shuttering manufacturing sites in earnest in 1999 when it closed 10
plants in the U.S. and others in Europe and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The closures will not reduce overall production, Levi said.</TE>
<TE>   The privately held firm, which also makes the Dockers brand, has
been struggling against fierce competition in recent years as
competing denim brands became less expensive or more fashionable,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Although Levi is the nation's largest-selling jeans brand, the
company's sales had fallen to $4.3 billion last year from $6.9billion
in 1997, a 38% drop.</TE>
<TE>   While the jeans are popular with adults, they've lost cachet with
trend conscious teens, apparel experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common knowledge that Levi has not connected well with teens
for quite a few years," said analyst Thomas Lewis of C.L. King &amp;
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear yet how much the shift will help Levi solve
slipping sales. But analysts say it is a wise move for a company that
historically has been considered one of the most all-American brands.</TE>
<TE>   "The broad industry trend is away from manufacturing and [toward]
a more product and marketing focus, regardless of the source of the
product," said Stephen Lamar, senior vice president of the American
Apparel &amp; Footwear Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Denim sales represent 75% of Levi's business. Overall demand for
denim has remained stable in recent years but prices have dropped,
which means companies must manufacture less expensively to maintain
or increase market share, apparel experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The unit sales were big, the dollar sales were relatively flat
[last year compared with 2000]," said Marshal Cohen, president of NPD
Fashion World, which tracks industry sales. In fact, NPD said,
apparel didn't grow last year in dollar sales. Cohen said he thinks
Levi is moving in "an excellent direction," and also has introduced
more stylish products.</TE>
<TE>   "Their business is not all doom and gloom," he said. "They just
need to find new ways to compete in a highly priced competitive
market."</TE>
<TE>   The Levi plant closures include a San Francisco plant that employs
about 100 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the sites are in Southern states--Texas, Georgia and
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Employees were notified Monday morning about what Levi called a
"painful but necessary business decision."</TE>
<TE>   The plants will close in three phases beginning in June. Levi will
have only two manufacturing sites left in the U.S., a sewing plant

<HD>Arcade Building to Be Turned Into Loft-Style Apartments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The historic Arcade Building in downtown Los Angeles will be
converted into 142 loft-style apartments as part of a $15-million
renovation to the mixed-use complex, according to property owner
Fifth Street Funding Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The 195,000-square-foot structure features two towers and a
cavernous interior arcade that stretches from Spring Street to
Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   The Spanish Revival Renaissance-styled arcade, designed by
architects Kenneth MacDonald and Maurice Couchot, was modeled on the
Burlington Arcade in London. The complex opened in 1924 as the
Mercantile Arcade Building.</LD>
<TE>   The renovation is slated to begin at the end of this year and is
scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Wade Killefer of Killefer Flammang Architects, which is
involved in several downtown loft conversions, will be the project's
executive architect.</TE>
<TE>   Each floor of the Arcade Building will have six apartments with
one or two bedrooms. Some of the units will overlook the retail
arcade.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to new apartments on the upper floors, the
ground-floor retail portion of the Arcade Building will undergo
extensive renovation.</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Shakes Off Drop From IBM Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street shook off an earnings warning from IBM on Monday,
recovering from a steep early drop to close mostly higher.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials, which include IBM, sank as much as 151 points
at the start of trading, but regained most of the loss by the close.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow finished off 22.56 points, or 0.2%, at 10,249.08.</LD>
<TE>   Most broader stock indexes ended with modest gains. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 edged up 0.2%. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite
rose 15.84 points, or 0.9%, to 1,785.87.</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 18 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, IBM's outlook came as a blow to investors who had hoped
that companies would post respectable first-quarter results and offer
upbeat forecasts. But as the session progressed some investors
appeared to view IBM's warning as more of an isolated event. Rumors
of a downbeat forecast from IBM began circulating Friday.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the decline in share prices over the last three
weeks--particularly in the tech sector--may already have "discounted"
disappointment in first-quarter results, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index fell 8.2% from March 11 to Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a difficult business climate, IBM said it expects
first-quarter earnings to be 66 cents to 70 cents a share, below the
85 cents Wall Street anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The computer giant's shares plummeted $9.84, or 10%, to $87.14.
But the stock's slump was mostly offset by other shares in the
30-stock Dow.</TE>
<TE>   3M, for example, gained $1.70 to $123.63 on the heels of its
upbeat earnings forecast last week. United Technologies jumped $1.15
to $73.95 amid another broad rally in defense-related shares after
Iraq said it would suspend oil shipments for a month, to protest the
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, Treasury yields rose modestly. Yields slid
last week as some investors looked for a safe haven in light of the
Middle East situation. The 10-year T-note yield rose to 5.26% on
Monday from 5.21% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, expectations overall aren't high for first-quarter
earnings: Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expect
that profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies will fall 9.2% in the first
quarter from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   More important than the actual results, experts say, will be the
forecasts companies offer for the rest of the year, reflecting the
economy's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter earnings reports are expected to dominate the news
on Wall Street starting this week.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Major tech stocks gaining ground despite IBM's warning included
Oracle, up 21 cents to $12.34; Microsoft, up $1.35 to $57.22; Dell
Computer, up 46 cents to $26.88; and Cisco Systems, up 3 cents to
$16.18.</TE>
<TE>   But Intel lost 12 cents to $29.93 and Sun Microsystems fell 21
cents to $8.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks continued to rebound from a recent sell-off.
Target gained $1.30 to $43.66, Home Depot added 73 cents to $49.50
and Wet Seal jumped $2 to $38.60.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy stocks rose as crude oil prices climbed in the wake of
the Iraqi announcement. Exxon Mobil gained 61 cents to $43.24,
ChevronTexaco jumped $1.26 to $88.40 and Kerr McGee surged $1.37 to
$61.25.</TE>
<TE>   * The rally in defense shares lifted Alliant Techsystems $2.02 to
$107.61, Integrated Defense Technologies $1.35 to $30.25 and Ducommun
$1.49 to $19.74.</TE>

<HD>SBC Exec Sees Threat to Web Communications</HD>
<DH>Courts: In fourth week of antitrust trial, witness says
Microsoft could thwart rivals from deploying new products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An executive of SBC Communications Inc. testified Monday that
antitrust penalties sought by nine states against Microsoft Corp.
would prevent the software giant from controlling an emerging market
of Internet communications products.</LD>
<LD>   But Microsoft lawyers fired back by painting SBC as a powerful
phone monopoly that wants to dominate a service to provide consumers
access to voicemail, e-mail and faxes from any telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Pearson, a product design executive helping SBC develop the
Unified Messaging System, said UMS threatens Microsoft's PC operating
system monopoly. It would be managed by big server computers on the
Internet rather than by consumers using a Windows-powered desktop PC
and a phone line.</LD>
<TE>   Pearson said he feared Microsoft would try to crush UMS, which SBC
plans to introduce in January.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the stand in the fourth week of the landmark antitrust
trial, Pearson testified that a proposed settlement reached between
Microsoft and the Justice Department last November is so loosely
written that the software giant could withhold technical information
or thwart rivals from effectively deploying UMS and other
non-Microsoft products.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson said Microsoft does not have to release enough details
about the inner workings of Windows software to allow UMS servers to
work effectively with Windows PCs.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft's lead trial attorney Dan Webb introduced an e-mail
from SBC executive Michael Hawkins that claimed the company had a
three-year lead over Microsoft in UMS.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Webb tried to get Pearson to acknowledge that the nation's
No. 2 regional telephone company, which dominates local phone service
in 13 states, hardly feared Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   "SBC believes today it will have a significant competitive
advantage for UMS products, correct?" Webb asked.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some advantage," Pearson responded. "I don't see them as
huge."</TE>
<TE>   Pearson was the 12th witness called by the District of Columbia
and nine holdout states seeking tougher penalties against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The holdouts argue that a proposed antitrust settlement between
Microsoft, the Justice Department and nine other states is too weak
and does not cover important computer technologies that have emerged
since the government first sued Microsoft on antitrust charges in May
1998. Microsoft contends the settlement is enough to restore
competition in the PC operating system market.</TE>

<HD>Crude Oil Prices Continue to Climb</HD>
<DH>Energy: A pledge by Iraq to cut exports and labor unrest in
Venezuela help the push upward. Retail gasoline hits $1.413.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil prices resumed their upward march Monday, boosted by a pledge
from Iraq to cut off oil exports for a month and labor problems in
Venezuela.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, retail gasoline prices continued to creep higher,
although motorists can look forward to a slightly cheaper fuel bill
this summer driving season than during the previous two summers, the
Energy Department said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Another day of Middle East unrest pushed the price of West Texas
intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, up 33 cents to close at
$26.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The current crude contract, which traded as high as $28.35 last
week, Monday touched $27.23 a barrel after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein ordered a 30-day suspension in oil sales to protest Israel's
military occupation of Palestinian areas. But reports late in the day
that the Israeli army was beginning to withdraw from some West Bank
cities helped quiet the market, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every minute, it seems, we've got new news," said Phil Flynn,
senior energy analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "This
could be a move that supports a more calm situation and would begin
to take some of the war premium out of the market."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq exports about 2 million barrels of oil a day, and the United
States buys slightly more than one-third of that, accounting for
about 4% of U.S. energy needs, according to Energy Department
statistics. Other members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries have about 5million barrels of unused capacity
and could make up any shortfall, should they choose to do so, said
Fadel Gheit, energy analyst with investment firm Fahnestock &amp; Co. in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts warned that oil markets are extremely nervous, making
large price swings likely.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's labor troubles, which sharply reduced exports Monday
from this major U.S. supplier, could provide another spark for an oil
price run-up. A 24-hour strike has been called for today in support
of dissident managers of Petroleos de Venezuela, who were replaced
with new executives by President Hugo Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Higher oil prices have translated into higher gasoline prices
across the United States.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the administration is
"taking aggressive action to prevent further steep price increases at
the pump," which have risen nearly 27% in the last six weeks, hitting
$1.413 a gallon Monday for self-serve regular gasoline. But Abraham
outlined only a few vague actions, including activating a hotline to
report price-gouging and finding ways to get Americans to drive more
efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   The average price of gasoline nationwide is still 8.7 cents a
gallon lower than it was at this time last year, according to the
weekly survey of more than 800 service stations by the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical arm.</TE>
<TE>   The average gasoline price in California rose 3 cents in the last
week to $1.622 a gallon. A year ago, the California average was 13.2
cents higher.</TE>
<TE>   Acting EIA Administrator Mary Hutzler acknowledged that
disruptions in petroleum supply, most likely from continued unrest in
the Middle East, could foul up the agency's relatively rosy summer
gasoline forecast of an average price of $1.46 a gallon nationwide,
8cents lower than last summer's average. Higher inventories of
gasoline should help buffer price increases, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The price spikes of previous summers that plagued California and
the Midwest are not expected to recur unless a problem occurs at a
refinery or a pipeline, EIA economist David Costello said. California
is vulnerable, however, because oil inventories are only slightly
more cushy than last year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The predicted average U.S. gasoline price of $1.46 a gallon is the
third-highest on record, after the summers of 2001 and 2000, the EIA
said.</TE>
<TE>   But adjusted for inflation, that price is a comparative bargain:
The record inflation-adjusted summer gas price was in 1980, at $2.65
a gallon in 2001 dollars, the EIA said.</TE>

<HD>More Firms Ease 401(k) Rules for Employer Stock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More companies are making it easier for their workers to reduce the
amount of company stock they hold in their 401(k) plans--an effort to
prevent a repeat of the retirement-savings meltdown that occurred at
Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Gillette Co. and media giants AOL Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney
Co. said they will let employees invest matching retirement funds in
shares other than company stock. Gillette and AOL Time Warner relaxed
their rules this month. Disney made the change March 8.</LD>
<LD>   Congress is considering proposals to limit the amount of company
stock that workers can own in their retirement plans.</LD>
<TE>   Enron employees lost an estimated $3 billion in savings after the
energy trader filed for bankruptcy protection and its stock plunged
to less than $1 from $80. About 62% of Enron's 401(k) plan was
invested in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in retirement plan rules may reflect companies'
concern about appearing to push purchases of their shares after the
losses at Enron, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies are going to be very wary of anything that
suggests the promotion of their own stock," said mutual fund
consultant Burt Greenwald.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Boston-based Gillette said the change in its
401(k) rules was unrelated to Enron or other issues. Gillette matches
a percentage of employee contributions to savings plans with company
stock. Before the regulations were changed, employees could not sell
the stock until they reached a certain age. Now they can sell the
stock and transfer it to one of the other funds in the plan.</TE>
<TE>   At AOL Time Warner, which also matches contributions with its
stock, employees couldn't switch to other investments until they were
50 years old and had been with the company for at least five years.
Now, employees can invest the company contribution in any of 100
mutual funds, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's policy is to match 50% of the first 4% an employee
contributes to the retirement plan, the company said. That match will
still be paid in company stock, but employees now have the option to
transfer it into other funds offered under the 401(k) plan.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies have made similar changes to their 401(k) plans
recently, including Gannett Co. and International Paper Co.</TE>

<LD>May Department Stores Co. plans to open more than 200 new stores by
the end of 2006, continuing the company's steady expansion plans
despite the rocky retail climate the last 18 months.</LD>
<LD>   May, which operates such stores as Lord &amp; Taylor, Famous-Barr and
Jones Store, said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission
filing that the company will open 62 new department stores and at
least 150 bridal group stores over the next five years. Included in
that total is a previously announced Robinsons-May store planned for
Orange County's Irvine Spectrum Center, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   A May company spokeswoman said the $4.1-billion five-year capital
plan is mostly a continuation of the company's pace of expansion
during the last several years.</LD>
<TE>   May's shares rose 33 cents to $35.30 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>U.S. hotel room demand will rise 3% this year, after the worst drop
in three decades in 2001, helped by the economy and lack of new
hotels being built, PricewaterhouseCoopers said.</LD>
<LD>   Hotel occupancy will rise 1.2% to 61.3%, and the average daily
rate will rise 1%, resulting in an increase in revenue per available
room to $52.53, from $51 last year, the firm said.</LD>
<LD>   The report represents a reversal from the firm's December forecast
that revenue per room would fall 0.2% on declines in both room rates
and occupancy.</LD>

<LD>   Adelphia Communications Corp. may spend less on cable-television
equipment and system upgrades to free up cash as regulators look into
whether the company disclosed enough information about its debt,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The company last month said it planned to spend $1 billion to $1.2
billion this year to buy gear and upgrade systems as part of spending
as much as $2.2 billion. Adelphia buys equipment from companies such
as Motorola Inc., Scientific-Atlanta Inc. and C-Cor.net Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Lower spending would give Adelphia the cash it needs to repay some
of the $2.3 billion in loans the company guaranteed to partnerships
run by the Rigas family, which controls the cable provider.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure of the debt sent Adelphia shares down 46% since
March 27.Adelphia shares rose 57 cents, or 5.5%, to $10.99 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>   Sales increased 0.8% to $227billion, the Commerce Department said.
Wholesale inventories fell 0.7%, a ninth straight decline that left
stockpiles at a two-year low. The drop left the inventory-to-sales
ratio, a gauge of how long goods sit in warehouses, at 1.26 months'
worth, the lowest since May 1997.</LD>

<LD>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal government agency that
insures corporate retirement plans, said it had a surplus of $7.7
billion for the year ended Sept. 30, as premium income offset payouts
and losses in stocks.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said its single-employer program, which covers about 35
million workers, had assets of about $21.7 billion and liabilities of
about $14 billion last year. It was the sixth consecutive annual
surplus after more than 20 years of deficits.</LD>
<LD>   In fiscal 2001, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. assumed
responsibility for 104 terminated single-employer plans covering
almost 89,000 people. This was the largest one-year increase in plan
participants.</LD>
<TE>   In fiscal 2001, the agency had a net investment loss of
$748million, as a $2.5-billion loss on equity investments outweighed
a gain of about $1.8billion from fixed-income investments.</TE>

beverages from labeling and advertising them as containing liquor, in
an effort to clear up confusion from consumers, state regulators and
tax authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is aimed
at the fast-growing market for "malternative" drinks. Like beer,
these products have a malt base, but they are usually clear and
flavored.</LD>
<LD>   Miller Brewing Co.'s Skyy Blue and Bacardi Silver are examples of
products that would need to change their labeling to comply, an ATF
spokesman said. Miller is a unit of Philip Morris Cos.</LD>

<LD>The federal agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plans to
review the companies' financial disclosure policies, and will bring
in Securities and Exchange Commission staff to help.</LD>
<LD>   The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight will compare
the disclosure policies and practices of the companies, the largest
buyers of home mortgages, to other publicly traded companies.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to ensure the companies' financial disclosure
practices "are at least comparable, if not better, where
appropriate," said Armando Falcon Jr., the office's director. The
agency may issue a report or seek to establish standards through a
formal rule-making process after the review.</LD>

<HD>Sony Puts Culver Studios Up for Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media giant Sony Pictures Entertainment put its famed Culver Studios
up for sale along with adjacent offices formerly used by the
company's television group.</LD>
<LD>   The historic Culver City property featuring a Mount Vernon-replica
facade, 14 sound stages and about 150,000 square feet of modern
offices might sell for more than $100 million, real estate
professionals estimate.</LD>
<LD>   The complex along Ince Boulevard at Washington Boulevard opened in
the early 20th century as the Thomas H. Ince Studios.</LD>
<TE>   The famous burning-of-Atlanta scene from "Gone With the Wind" was
filmed there, as were several classic films including "Citizen Kane"
and the original "King Kong."</TE>
<TE>   Culver Studios also has been the home of many television series
dating to the early days of the medium. The property has carried such
storied names as DeMille, RKO, Pathe, Selznick, Desilu and Laird,
said real estate broker Carl Muhlstein of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who
heads the sales team for Sony.</TE>
<TE>   A Sony affiliate bought the studio for a reported $80 million in
1991. The acquisition came as Sony Pictures was relocating much of
the former Columbia Pictures operation to Culver City, primarily to
the nearby and much larger lot previously owned by
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.</TE>
<TE>   Sony custom-built two three-story office buildings for its
television group in the mid-1990s during the Peter Guber/Jon Peters
regime noted for extravagant spending. Muhlstein described the
offices as "a private gated campus."</TE>
<TE>   The studio might sell the lot with or without the pair of office
buildings, which house Sony's ImageWorks visual effects group.</TE>
<TE>   At the direction of its Japanese parent company--the world's
leading consumer electronics manufacturer--Sony Pictures has been
cutting costs in part by reducing development of new network
television programming.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sony continues to manage Culver Studios, independent
production companies rather than SSony affiliates are the primary
users of its sound stages, Muhlstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's recent sale of its interest in the Telemundo network also
reduced needs for studio space. Sony owns and operates one of the
industry's highest-profile studio complexes adjacent to SPE's nearby
headquarters at Washington and Overland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Although commercial real estate has generally been in the
doldrums, Hollywood has pumped up production somewhat after a
relatively slow period. Demand for local sound stages often exceeds
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   A variety of prospective buyers have expressed interest in the
Culver City property, Muhlstein said, including such obvious
prospective buyers as independent production operations, stage
operators and real estate investment specialists.</TE>

<HD>Clothing Firm Adopts Non-Sweatshop Concept</HD>
<DH>It hopes to stay competitive and turn a profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ice cream mogul turned social activist Ben Cohen is out to prove it's
possible to make clothes with a conscience in Los Angeles, a city
maligned by some as the nation's sweatshop capital.</LD>
<LD>   His hopes are taking form in a bland warehouse set on an aging
industrial strip just south of the city center. There a few dozen
true believers bustle about with samples of SweatX, the brand of
casual clothing they hope to market to college bookstores and
high-end sports shops.</LD>
<LD>   The enterprise is run by a former banker who took a 50% pay cut
and is staffed by veteran garment workers who can hardly believe
their luck at landing an $8.50-an-hour job, with benefits, a pension
and profit-sharing. Backed with $1.5 million from Cohen's Hot Fudge
Social Venture Fund, the business--which officially opens today--is
aiming to show a profit within a year.</LD>
<TE>   More significantly, SweatX plans to raise consumer awareness of
working conditions in garment shops while proving to other
manufacturers that it's possible to pay a "living" wage and still
earn a profit, say those involved in the start-up.</TE>
<TE>   "We aim to put the lie to the myth that it's impossible to produce
clothing at a competitive price and have a good quality of work
life," said Cohen, co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc., by
telephone from his home base in Vermont. "Will we succeed? All I can
say is, we'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Although most clothing makers insist that they treat workers well,
few have marketed themselves that way.</TE>
<TE>   And the evidence is against them in Los Angeles, where state and
federal inspectors frequently find violations of wage, hour and
safety laws at work sites.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 140,000 production workers are employed in the Los
Angeles garment business, most at small contract shops that churn out
orders for manufacturers and retailers at slim profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole industry is based on the fact that workers are not paid
properly," says Kimi Lee, director of the nonprofit Garment Workers
Center in downtown Los Angeles. "Hopefully, SweatX will be a
successful business and a good example, but they'll be competing
against every factory that's not doing things the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry are watching skeptically, including Ilse
Metchek, director of the California Fashion Assn. "I welcome them to
the community. I think what they're trying is wonderful. But it's not
proven yet," Metchek said.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that the production of basic apparel--including
sweatshirts, jeans and undergarments--generally has moved to Mexico,
China and other countries where labor is cheaper, leaving Los Angeles
with trendy fashion wear that requires a quick turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   She questioned whether shoppers will be willing to pay a premium
for a T-shirt just because the worker who made it was paid and
treated well.</TE>
<TE>   "Students protest. They yell and scream. But when push comes to
shove, they go to Wal-Mart and buy clothing made in Saipan," Metchek
said.</TE>
<TE>   TeamX, the managers and unionized factory workers behind the new
label, are betting otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   They say that growing anti-sweatshop activism on campuses across
the country proves there's a willing market and profess amazement
that no one has tried to fill it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there who believe in the message," said Doug
Waterman, a commercial banker for 32 years and now SweatX's president
and chief financial officer. "Are there enough to make this a
successful business venture? That's the big gamble."</TE>
<TE>   Waterman said SweatX will produce clothing at the high end of the
casual market, using fabrics such as hemp blends and organic cottons
and designs that incorporate hip slogans with a social bent. And
because production workers are organized under UNITE, the garment
union, the brand hopes to be a major supplier for labor unions and
governments.</TE>
<TE>   The company hopes to keep the labor premium under $1 per garment
by boosting production and shaving costs.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the company said it has eliminated middlemen such as
labor contractors by directly employing those involved in production,
from designers to packagers.</TE>
<TE>   The Hot Fudge investment will enable the company to buy
state-of-the-art equipment, including air-driven sewing machines and
a completely automated $200,000 computerized cutting machine. SweatX
intends to repay that investment interest, Waterman said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, he said, the company will benefit from
high productivity because all workers, from sewing machine operators
to sales staff, will be part-owners of the business.</TE>
<TE>   Parity is built into the labor-management compact: No manager can
earn more than eight times the pay of the lowest-paid production
worker, Waterman said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 20 production workers are now employed, but Waterman said he
hopes that figure will be up to 80 within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he said, the company may expand vertically, to include
embroidery on one end and fabric making on the other.</TE>
<TE>   With only a few weeks on the job producing samples, several sewing
machine operators said the job seemed too good to be true.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working in clothing for 20 years, and I never had a
paid holiday before this," said Ana Acevedo, a Salvadoran immigrant
whose highest-paying job before this was $7.25 per hour. "My last job
paid cash. Sometimes less than the minimum."</TE>
<TE>   Several other employees ran their own subcontracting businesses,
squeezing by each month with the threat of bankruptcy hanging over
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Contreras, who worked as a contractor for 10 years, suffered a
series of setbacks, including nonpayment from several contractors,
before finally going broke last year. He recalled instances of paying
his employees with sewing machines.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a good feeling about this one," he said. "No more
headaches for me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ruled that Hewlett-Packard Co. must face trial on a dissident
director's claims of vote- buying in the fight over the company's
$19-billion bid for Compaq Computer Corp. Delaware Chancery Court
Judge William Chandler III said Walter Hewlett's lawsuit meets the
standards for suits over proxy contests.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett's suit, filed March 28, claims the company gave
shareholder Deutsche Bank new business for changing its vote to favor
the Compaq acquisition. The trial is set for April 23.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Compaq said it sees first-quarter revenue of $7.7 billion
and said it expects to meet or beat analyst consensus estimates of 1
cent a share for first-quarter earnings, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Compaq's announcement sent its shares up 55 cents to $10.14 in
after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. HP shares rose 28
cents to $17.40 in extended trading, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Leaves Castro's Cuba Behind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE DRESSER</AU>
<BD> Denise Dresser is a senior fellow at the Pacific
Council on International Policy at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, Mexico and Cuba were best buddies in the Western
Hemisphere. Brandishing the banners of nonintervention and
self-determination, both countries provided each other with
unconditional support and kept quiet about their mutual lack of
democratic development. Those days are over, and today relations
between Cuba and Mexico are at an all-time low, for all the right
reasons. Mexico's foreign policy toward Cuba is changing, and Fidel
Castro is furious about it.</LD>
<LD>   The comandante is lashing out against Jorge Castaneda, Mexico's
minister of foreign affairs--calling him a lackey of the United
States--out of sheer desperation and growing isolation. Castro's
anger is proportional to the size of Mexico's foreign policy shift.
Castro would like to keep Cuba-Mexico relations as suspended in time
as the city of Havana. He would like nonintervention in other
countries' affairs to prevail so that he can hide what happens to his
own people.</LD>
<LD>   But Mexico no longer wants to revere the Cuban revolution or
ignore its shortcomings, and Castro resents the change of course.
Mexico seeks to promote human rights; Castro doesn't even know what
they are. Mexico will continue to oppose the U.S. embargo while at
the same time recognizing that it can't justify the lack of democracy
on the island.</LD>
<TE>   Castro is trying to stop a substantive policy shift by turning it
into a personal attack that will prompt the removal of Castaneda from
his post. As he has done for years with the Cuban people, Castro
wants to distract attention from the heart of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   And, up until now, he has achieved his objective. The Mexican
left-wing intelligentsia and opposition members of Congress have
spent the last two weeks developing a dictionary of synonyms wherein
"Jorge Castaneda" means cynic, diabolical, Machiavellian, peon of
American foreign policy and so on.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who knows Mexico's foreign affairs minister would agree
that some of these epithets have a reason for being. Castaneda
believes--like Che Guevara, whom he wrote a book about--that to win
in politics one must be willing to spill blood.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue is not Castaneda's personal flaws; it's his vision
of Mexico's new foreign policy. Castaneda is revising stances because
they no longer work. Human rights have become a legitimate concern of
an international community that Mexico wants to be a part of. The
world has changed and therefore Mexico's position on Cuba must too.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore it makes sense for Mexico to assume a more active role
on the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It makes sense for Mexico's
President Vicente Fox to meet with Cuban dissidents and recognize
that they exist.</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense for Castaneda to argue that the relationship with
the Cuban revolution has ended, and the relationship with the Cuban
republic has begun. Mexico is demonstrating that it understands the
changes in the international environment and wants to be part of
them.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba cannot be treated as an exception to the rule in Mexico's
foreign policy and remain immune to criticism because of an
anachronistic friendship based on a complicit silence. Where human
rights and democracy are concerned, Castaneda and Mexico's new
foreign policy are on the right side of history.</TE>
<TE>   As the cases of Augusto Pinochet and Slobodan Milosevic prove,
human rights are no longer an exclusively domestic affair, and the
Mexican left needs to understand that nonintervention is a principle
whose time has passed.</TE>
<TE>   This tempest in the Cuba-Mexico teapot will pass. Meanwhile,
Mexico's foreign policy will have changed and for the better. The
principle of the protection of human rights will prevail in Mexico
and elsewhere. As Castaneda's father, Mexico's minister of foreign
affairs 20 years ago, said: "Friend, when you defend principles
instead of interests, you never lose."</TE>

<HD>Organ Donors May Risk Their Health</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY E. PENCE</AU>
<BD> Gregory E. Pence is a professor of medical ethics at
the University of Alabama Medical School and author of "Re-Creating
Medicine: Ethical Options at the Frontiers of Medicine" (Rowman &amp;
Littlefield, 2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newspapers recently described the death of Albany, N.Y., newspaper
reporter Mike Hurewitz at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City after
he donated part of his liver to his brother. Other stories about
living organ donors are starting to appear, such as that of Barbara
Tarrant, a 69-year-old North Carolina woman who donated a kidney to
her mentally retarded son and who wound up paralyzed on her left side
and without coherent speech.</LD>
<LD>   What's going on here?</LD>
<LD>   Consider a full-page New York Times ad for Mount Sinai from
December, which boasts that the hospital is "at the forefront of
living-donor transplantation" and does more living-donor transplants
"than any other hospital in the country."</LD>
<TE>   Yet though such donors are widely regarded as heroic in the
popular media, living-donor transplantations carry real dangers. No
one really knows how many people have died from such surgeries, and
living-donor transplant centers certainly aren't going to tell us.</TE>
<TE>   For many decades, a bright ethical line existed in transplant
surgery: "First, do no harm." This meant, among other things, that
even to help another, never render a healthy person dead. A kidney
transplant from one identical child-twin to the other crossed that
line in 1954. Then came all the parents donating parts of livers and
lungs to their children.</TE>
<TE>   By 1999, the American Medical News, the American Medical Assn.'s
weekly newspaper, mentioned the first "confirmed" although "not
officially described" death from adult-to-adult liver donation, and
it also guessed that two or three other adults had died from donating
parts of their organs to children. No one knows the real figures
because no law or regulation requires doctors or hospitals to report
them.</TE>
<TE>   Many troubling ethical questions come with transplants. If it
becomes the norm, how can a parent not volunteer to donate? Given the
heroic mantle wrapped around healthy-donor transplantation, can real
informed consent be obtained? Do the enormous costs of such
operations (a liver transplant costs, on average, $250,000) and their
likely harm to donors justify expansion of the trend?</TE>
<TE>   The answers to these questions need a context, and it is this: If
there were no alternative to living-donor transplantation, it might
be justified. After all, about 4,000 Americans die every year waiting
for organ transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there is another way: We could start paying families
for the organs of deceased relatives. More technically, states could
allow "rewarded cadaveric donation," such that families that agreed
to donate would get, say, $1,000 toward a funeral. Tens of thousands
of usable organs now go to worms and could be used to save lives.</TE>
<TE>   True, there are risks of commercialization, and we certainly don't
want a market for organs. But paying a small stipend would encourage
the kind of donation that is already legal for brain-dead patients.
And the question is not whether any risk of harm exists from
commercialization--it does--but whether such risk justifies the
sacrifice of thousands of dying patients.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Jews Cannot Acquiesce to Sharon's Monstrous Behavior</HD>
<DH>Both Israel's prime minister and Yasser Arafat are killers
of the innocent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD> Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does it mean to be Jewish? Is it belief in a set of religious
values, identity with a much-splintered ethnic tribe or automatic
membership among God's chosen people as certified by the lineage of
one's mother?</LD>
<LD>   For many, being Jewish carries with it the lessons of universal
tolerance and compassion, while for others it is a "never again"
pride in the military power of a David turned modern-day Goliath.</LD>
<LD>   This latter allusion to the Holocaust, a horror that occurred in
the center of modern European civilization and had little to do with
the Arabs, nonetheless provides the enduring rationale for Israeli
brutality in the name of self-defense. What irony that many Jews now
comfortably vacation in Germany but insist that Arab anti-Semitism is
an immutable aspect of Muslim culture that can be met only with the
crushing power of tanks.</LD>
<TE>   Not that anyone asked me, but those are not my tanks careening
around the West Bank bringing fear and havoc in their wake. Yet they
are marked as Jewish tanks and consequently they and I bear some
familial resemblance on my mother's side. I am thus obligated to
consider what cruelty is being done in the name of defending my
people.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us make a deliberate effort to disassociate from the
mayhem of Ariel Sharon's carnage, while others seem to wallow in it,
as if displaying the awesome firepower of the Israeli army is
necessary to the survival of the Jewish state. I would like to think
that the peacemakers still outnumber the militarists among U.S. Jews,
but my own e-mail and street-corner conversations no longer bear out
that hope.</TE>
<TE>   While Jews are hardly monolithic, even in their views of Israel,
their large presence in the media contrasts sharply with a near total
exclusion of Palestinian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Americans in particular, and Arabs in general, are the
ghosts haunting U.S. newsrooms by their embarrassing absence. As
journalists, we do not know them as a people, we have little
connection with their slights and sorrows, and we can only, even with
the best of intentions, experience their suffering as an abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   While the family tales of Jewish oppression during the pogroms of
czars, the Holocaust and Soviet anti-Semitism have been merged into
the dominant American culture, horrific tales of Arab suffering are
systematically ignored. But, as when blacks and Latinos were absent
from newsrooms and nightly death in the ghetto was not thought to be
news, it is difficult to escape the notion that many in the media,
Jews and non-Jews alike, lean to the view that Arab life is cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the attention accorded affirmative action by news
organizations on the grounds that diversity is necessary to better
news reporting, the exclusion of Arabs has been ignored. It is not
appropriate, particularly given the past decades in which
Arab-Israeli strife has never left the news and has frequently been a
front-page headline--a story covered far differently by the European
media, where Arab voices are much more integrated.</TE>
<TE>   One can recognize this enormous imbalance without endorsing the
anti-Semitic slanders of the late Richard M. Nixon and the Rev. Billy
Graham, who asserted in tapes made 30 years ago, which were recently
released, that Jews control the media. They don't own the media. Nor
do Jewish journalists toe a common Israeli party line. Indeed, they
are less inclined to apologize for Israel than Graham, who has lined
up consistently behind Israeli militarism as somehow godly.</TE>
<TE>   For Nixon there were good Jews, such as his speech writer William
Safire, who was hawkish back then and whose current columns in the
New York Times provide the most reliable outlet for Sharon's
propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon himself is a man of barbaric impulse, demonstrated all too
clearly in his terrorizing of civilians two decades ago in Lebanon
and now on the West Bank. He has been a consistent provocateur,
undermining peace efforts no matter their content, and now he is
using his tanks to poison the ground for future generations.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Yasser Arafat also has poisoned the ground under his feet and
shares responsibility with Sharon for the breakdown of the peace
process. But until recently, Arafat has been unrelentingly reviled by
the news media while Sharon, no less monstrous in his behavior,
hardly has been criticized.</TE>
<TE>   Both are killers of the innocent. Both are to be roundly condemned
by all, and the failure of prominent moderate Arabs to do their part
to restrain Arafat is all too obvious. No less a moral offense is the
acquiescence of too many Jews, in Israel and abroad, to the
comparable crimes of Sharon.</TE>

<LD>Drug arrests--In a story Friday in Section A about tainted drug
busts in Dallas, a defense attorney was quoted as saying that his
client's signature was forged on drug informant receipts. The quote was
misattributed to Glenn White, the president of the Dallas Police Assn.
The statement in fact came from attorney William Nellis.</LD>

<LD>Dallas Maverick assistant coach Del Harris, the former Laker coach,
remembers a time not long ago when only bikers, rebels and sailors
had tattoos. Once-conservative Del has since joined the parade.</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, Harris followed the lead of his children when he
and his wife, Anne, got tattoos while in Hawaii. Harris has a
basketball going through a net on his upper left arm, and Anne a
hummingbird on her back.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a change in the times," said Harris, 64. "When I first
started coaching, I was against long hair and facial hair, but if you
stay inflexible, you're not going to stay around 40 years."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which golfer has finished second the most times
without winning the Masters?</TE>
<TE>   Positive reaction: Barbara Barker of Newsday poses the question,
was Michael Jordan's return good or bad for the NBA? She got an
answer from Laker Coach Phil Jackson: "I felt it was terrific. It was
an inspiring effort, especially for those of you out there who are 40
years old. It must have felt pretty good [watching him]."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan turned 39 on Feb. 17.</TE>
<TE>   More Jordan: Michael Ventre of MSNBC.com weighs in on Jordan with
this comment: "I'm hoping Michael Jordan keeps playing in the NBA for
a long, long time. Because the longer he plays basketball, the less
likely it is he'll try a comeback in baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Star appraisal: Like Tiger Woods, Texas Ranger shortstop Alex
Rodriguez is a gifted athlete at age 26. A-Rod spoke about Woods
recently to Brian Murphy of the San Francisco Chronicle when the
Rangers were in Oakland: "I don't think anybody can appreciate Tiger,
because no one ever gives him any time to struggle. They call 10
tournaments without a win a struggle, and that's ludicrous.</TE>
<TE>   "Only time will be able to appreciate what he's done, and the
reason why he's so unappreciated is that he's done it so quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Putdown: Jon Saraceno in USA Today on the Dodgers: "The
organization always stood for continuity and class but, to borrow a
phrase used by a colleague to describe the decline of the Boston
Celtics' dynasty, the only thing the Dodgers stand for now is the
national anthem."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1965, the Houston Astrodome,
baseball's first domed stadium, was opened for an exhibition game
between the Astros and New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this date in 1978, David Thompson of the
Denver Nuggets scored 73 points against the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Only Wilt Chamberlain has scored more points in an NBA game, the
record being 100 scored against New York on March 2, 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tom Weiskopf, who finished second four times, 1969,
1972, 1974 and 1975.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Baseball legend Frank Robinson, 66, is managing the
lame-duck Montreal Expos this season. Comedian Bill Cosby visited
Robinson and marveled at Montreal's apathy toward baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "How many hot dogs do they precook for a game here? Five?" Cosby
quipped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite interesting to be able to sit and watch nine innings
of ball, then occasionally walk around and pick up balls that have
been knocked into the stands."</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Eleven years ago Monday he was playing golf, drinking and then trying
to drive home. He reached for the cell phone, the car veered off the
road, he noticed a bridge ahead, he made a quick correction and the
car flipped over and over as it rolled down a 50-foot embankment.</LD>
<LD>   The roof jammed his head into the steering wheel, damaging the
fifth, sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae and paralyzing him from
his neck down, and as the story goes now in racing circles, Bill
Shoemaker was told that day, "Blink once if you want to stay alive,
twice if you would like to die."</LD>
<LD>   He blinked once.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ELEVEN YEARS ago Monday, coincidentally, the Shoemaker Foundation
scheduled a golf tournament here in his name to raise money for those
in the racing industry stricken by injury or illness.</TE>
<TE>   "I rode more than 40,000 horses," Shoemaker said, and of all
things he got hurt riding in a Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie Arcaro and I used to talk about it--if we ever fell we
hoped to God we never wound up paralyzed. When we were young we'd
talk about how we could never put up with something like that. But
when it happened, you have no choice. You have to put up with it."</TE>
<TE>   For most people no introduction is necessary. Shoemaker is a
jockey icon, a winner of 8,833 races and 11 Triple Crown events.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents remember driving home from Las Vegas and hearing of
JFK's death," said jockey Gary Stevens, here to play in the
tournament. "I remember being at Mammoth, driving home through the
desert, hearing about [Shoemaker's] accident on the radio and going
just nuts in my car trying to listen to this fading-in-and-out AM
radio. There are days like that for people where you just remember
where you were."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ELEVEN YEARS ago Monday, the ordeal began--a metal halo supporting
his head, a respirator enabling him to breathe. But now he breathes
into a tube, the wheelchair moves and the conversation jumps from
subject to subject.</TE>
<TE>   As small as he had to be as a jockey, his little body is almost
lost in the big chair. And beyond the alert eyes, it's the hands that
grab your attention, the famous soft hands that made him one with a
horse, which are now sitting there palms flat and looking as soft as
ever. But unable to move.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I never said, 'Why me?' It was like in racing when I lost,
maybe something happened, maybe it was my fault. It didn't matter.
There was another race to ride.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't anyone's fault but my own. I just have to live with
it. I doubt if I'll live long enough for them to find a cure, but I
believe firmly one day there will be one. That's what I tell young
adults I meet, who are in a similar position: 'Be patient, it's going
to happen, and you're going to make it one day and be up again.'"</TE>
<TE>   If it's everyone else's nightmare, he's the one sitting in the
chair, 70 years old now, but not looking a day over 50. And so what
is it like--just sitting there?</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be as happy as I can," he said. "I just told myself it's
something that happened to me, it's happened to other people, and I
have to learn to live with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you, there are a lot of people in this world who are
worse off than I am. I look at some of these 6- and 7-year-olds who
are like me now, and that's what really gets to me."</TE>
<TE>   The Shoemaker Foundation, established in 1991, has raised millions
of dollars, and a significant contribution has been made to the
Paralysis Project, committed to finding a cure for those who cannot
move.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather help by being up and running around," Shoemaker said,
"but it's one of the good things I can still do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE MISSES golf, said Shoemaker, who shot a 73 at Riviera once and
played to a seven handicap, but not enough to watch golfers try to
impress him with their ugly swings at the Spanish Trail Country Club
on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   However, when the food was served at the banquet after the
tournament, he was first in line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN HE came into the Orleans Hotel and Casino last weekend, he no
sooner had gotten in the door when three women approached him.</TE>
<TE>   "Three older women," he said. "I no longer get the young ones."</TE>
<TE>   He said some people are uncomfortable approaching him--many
putting a hand out to shake before realizing what they have done.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm just another person," he said, and when something is said
about the beating his body must have taken all those years while
falling off horses, he demonstrates he's just another person with a
wicked sense of humor: "Don't forget, I was married three times, and
that's hard on a guy too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SHOEMAKER GAVE up horse training because of the time it takes to
exercise his body, but he still makes it to the track, and when asked
what he watches during a race, he said, "The horse I bet on."</TE>
<TE>   He rode Swaps to a Derby win, considers Spectacular Bid the best
horse he rode, and made Patchy Groundfog the 40,352nd--and
final--mount of his career. But now it's someone like actor
Christopher Reeve who gets his attention.</TE>
<TE>   Reeve fell off a horse and is a quadriplegic like Shoemaker but
insists some time soon he will walk again. Shoemaker has talked with
Reeve and not only shares his enthusiasm but believes him.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't give up," he said. "It's like riding a race--you
ride it all the way to the finish line. You just might win."</TE>
<TE>   As if there was any doubt he'd blink just once.</TE>

<LD>There isn't a bigger thrill ride around than the Kings, in that theme
park known as the NHL's Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   They can be exhilarating and heartbreaking, all in the course of
the same game.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings come out and play a dominant first period, as they did
against the Dallas Stars Monday night, and all you can do is hold
your breath.</LD>
<TE>   After all, this is the team that let a two-goal lead evaporate in
the final 21/2 minutes against Vancouver last week. They had to go to
overtime to get a victory over Edmonton last weekend after giving up
a goal with 10 seconds remaining in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   They beat Dallas, 3-0, Monday and now they can even think about
winning the Pacific Division. And the only thing you can say to them
is: Watch your step.</TE>
<TE>   They fought all the way back to tie the San Jose Sharks for first
place in the division on March 23, and just when King fans began to
exhale, the Kings slid down the chute. Since then they've occupied
fourth, fifth, sixth and even seventh place in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The ground rules are in flux too. Back in November, when Coach
Andy Murray told them they would have to get to 93 points to make the
playoffs, he might as well have asked them to jump to the moon. Now
even Murray admits, "It was a sense of desperation" and "a coach
scrambling."</TE>
<TE>   Well, here they are in lunar orbit, and it looks as if they'll
have to choose another destination. Mars, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   They're at 93 points and still don't have that coveted "x" next to
their name in the standings, that precious letter that signifies a
team has clinched a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   But they do have an opportunity to play for the division crown,
thanks in part to San Jose's loss to Minnesota Monday night. The
Kings trail the Sharks by two points. Amid all the madness that has
you covering your eyes, if you peek long enough, the Kings look like
a playoff-bound squad.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, the teams were in playoff mode. Very little
extracurricular stuff, shots at a premium with every time down the
ice carrying weight.</TE>
<TE>   And for the most part, the Kings looked better prepared to play
this style of hockey and do everything it takes to win these crucial
games.</TE>
<TE>   They directed the flow of the game for much of the night. They
refrained from penalties until the third period.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas took the first penalty, one that was both unnecessary and
costly, with 9:05 left in the first period. After Ian Laperriere
leveled Mike Modano with a clean hit, Dallas defenseman John Erskine
took exception and came after Laperriere. Although they both had to
serve five-minute penalties for fighting, Erskine got an extra two
minutes for instigating--in addition to a 10-minute misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   On the power play, the Kings scored when Dallas defenseman Derian
Hatcher left Adam Deadmarsh alone in front of the net to chase Jason
Allison.</TE>
<TE>   Allison slid the puck to Deadmarsh, who scored.</TE>
<TE>   Their second goal, in the third period, was straight out of
Showtime. The Kings weaved down the ice with Bryan Smolinski finding
Ziggy Palffy, who made a backhand pass to Eric Belanger, who gave it
back to an open Palffy for the shot.</TE>
<TE>   Murray put extra emphasis on this game. "We need to get this win
here tonight," he said beforehand, and he called it the "toughest
game of the homestand."</TE>
<TE>   But in many ways it was set up for a great shot at two points.
While the Kings rested Sunday night, the Stars had to play the Mighty
Ducks, who beat them, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   And in many ways this game showed the progress the Kings have
made.The Stars didn't worry about the Kings for most of the 1990s--a
decade that included four consecutive seasons when the Kings could
not beat Dallas even once.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars were chasing after the President's Trophy. The Kings
were trying to get within shooting range of respectability.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Red Wings are so far out of reach that they weren't
listed among the playoff contenders on the board in the Kings'
dressing room at HealthSouth. But everyone else is fair game for the
Kings. Now and in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The likes of Dallas and St. Louis are trailing them.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed unlikely at the start of the season. Even now, in the
waning days, there are no easy predictions. Only hunches.</TE>
<TE>   Hold on, because the Kings just might get there.</TE>

<LD>Robin Ventura drove in six suns and Alfonso Soriano had a career-high
five hits to help the defending American League champion New York
Yankees win their sixth consecutive game since an opening-day loss,
16-3, over the Toronto Blue Jays Monday at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   "Our pitchers are unbelievable, and our hitting is starting to
come around. It's going to be a lot of fun this year," New York's
Jason Giambi said.</LD>
<LD>   Soriano and Ventura each hit three-run homers and rookie Nick
Johnson added a two-run shot for the Yankees, who had 22 hits,
including nine in an eight-run sixth inning. David Wells won his
second consecutive start, breezing past the team the Yankees had
traded him to three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people get intimidated by the offense that we have,"
Wells said. "As long as we go out and throw strikes and make good
pitches I think that we'll just let the other team psyche themselves
out."</TE>
<TE>   New York sent 13 men to the plate in the sixth, its biggest inning
since a nine-run eighth during a 22-1 rout of Boston on June 19,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Minnesota 5--Travis Fryman hit a grand slam, Ellis
Burks and Matt Lawton homered and the Indians cruised in their home
opener.</TE>

<HD>Garner, Smith Fired by Tigers</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somebody had to go following the Detroit Tigers' 0-6 start. The team
decided two was better, so it fired Manager Phil Garner and General
Manager Randy Smith on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal of Garner tied the quickest firing of a manager who
started the season since 1900, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
Baltimore fired Cal Ripken Sr. in 1988 after the Orioles lost six
games en route to an 0-21 start.</LD>
<LD>   "You could bring in MacArthur, with what they gave him to work
with, and he's probably not going to come out with more wins," Tiger
outfielder Bobby Higginson said.</LD>
<TE>   The Tigers haven't had a winning record or a winning April since
1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only a short-term decision, it's a long-term decision,"
said Tiger President Dave Dombrowski, who will add the general
manager's duties. "We don't have a championship-caliber club, but we
haven't played well either."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Pujols, the Tigers' bench coach, will take over as manager of
baseball's only winless team on an interim basis. His debut was
postponed when Monday's game against Chicago was rained out.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Alou, fired last year as Montreal's manager, was considered
a top candidate to wind up with the Tigers' job.</TE>
<TE>   Dombrowski said he has not contacted Alou, who was Montreal's
manager while Dombrowski was the Expos' general manager from 1986-91.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We will look to interview managers as soon as possible,"
Dombrowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos was added to management's
negotiating committee.... Texas Ranger reliever Rich Rodriguez will
miss at least two months following surgery on his left shoulder to
correct a circulatory problem in his pitching hand.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Disney Can Open Books for Suitors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Walt Disney Co. has received permission to share the Angels'
confidential financial data with several potential buyers, including
Alabama businessman Donald Watkins, Commissioner Bud Selig said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins met with Disney officials March 22 to discuss his interest
in purchasing the Angels. He has submitted a preliminary offer of
$250 million for the team, but sources close to the negotiations
confirm the offer is neither binding nor exclusive, allowing Watkins
to continue talks with other teams and Disney to continue talks with
other suitors.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins is believed to have offered between $125 and $150 million
for the Minnesota Twins, but Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad has said he
would prefer to sell to local buyers.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball rules require owners to receive permission to open their
books to potential buyers, a step that would precede any sale.</TE>
<TE>   Selig would not identify the Angels' other suitors and would say
only that Disney has been granted permission to open the team's books
several times "in the past year."</TE>
<TE>   Former commissioner Peter Ueberroth, whose investment group was
outbid by Disney for the Angels in 1995, said Monday his partnership
remains interested in buying a professional sports franchise but is
not interested in the Angels at the present time.</TE>
<TE>   Another group, led by former Madison Square Garden president Dave
Checketts, is believed to have explored--and for now rejected--the
possibility of buying the Angels and Mighty Ducks. In November,
negotiations to sell the Angels to John Henry, then the owner of the
Florida Marlins, collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins, who has pursued the purchase of a major league team since
last summer, met with Selig for the first time March 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a very pleasant visit," Selig said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several fans expressed disappointment upon entering Edison Field
for the first games of the season and discovering that the Angels had
discontinued the "Power Angels" promotion, a so-called "frequent fan"
program that rewarded fans with merchandise and other free prizes
based on the number of games attended.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels used registration information to compile a data base of
45,000 fans, but spokesman Tim Mead said the promotion no longer was
cost-effective because 90% of the fans in the data bank had become
"inactive" ticket buyers over the three years of the program.</TE>

<HD>Vaughn Sidelined by Broken Hand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Met first baseman Mo Vaughn is back on the disabled list
with a small break just below the pinkie of his right hand.</LD>
<LD>   Vaughn was hit by a pitch from Pittsburgh's Jimmy Anderson in the
first inning Thursday. Vaughn did not think the injury was serious,
stayed in the game and played the next day in Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   But he felt pain during the weekend, sat out Saturday and Sunday,
and learned of the break after an X-ray Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The team put Vaughn on the disabled list and recalled outfielder
Timo Perez from triple-A Norfolk. Vaughn, 34, is eligible to be
activated April 21.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn, acquired in an off-season trade, struggled with injuries
during three seasons with the Angels. He twisted his ankle on opening
day in 1999 and never really recovered, then missed all of 2001 with
a torn tendon in his left biceps.</TE>
<TE>   Met General Manager Steve Phillips was worried that if Vaughn
continued to play, a larger break could develop if the hand got hit
again. When he returns, Vaughn probably will wear padding under his
batting glove.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Maddux threw for 20 minutes in the bullpen and is expected to
start Friday when the Atlanta Braves play at Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux has missed two starts, including his opening-day assignment
last week, because of an inflamed nerve in his lower back.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time National League Cy Young Award winner had never been
on the disabled list in his 15-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The injury originally was diagnosed as a strained muscle in
Maddux's right hip, but an MRI exam last Tuesday showed three
inflamed areas in his right hip and buttocks area.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux is eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday, and
had been hoping to pitch against the Phillies. But Brave Manager
Bobby Cox said there's no reason to rush his ace so early in the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. stayed in Cincinnati to begin rehabilitating his
injured knee and the Reds replaced him on their roster with Ruben
Mateo as they began a trip in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey partially tore the patella tendon and partially dislocated
his right kneecap during a rundown in Sunday's game against Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds are hoping Griffey can return to action in three to six
weeks, but if he needs an operation, he could be out for the rest of
the season, team physician Timothy Kremchek said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, who was bothered during spring training by tendinitis in
the knee, was hurt as he was being tagged by Montreal third baseman
Chris Truby in the seventh inning. Griffey had tried to score from
third on a grounder and was trapped in a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Griffey missed most of the first three months because
of a partially torn left hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   Mateo was originally in the Reds' starting lineup Monday in right
field against the Pirates, but was scratched because of a head cold
and replaced by Adam Dunn. Juan Encarnacion replaced Griffey in
center field.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Marlin catcher Charles Johnson, who missed the first week
of the season with a sprained left thumb, was activated from the
disabled list and started the team's home opener Monday against
Montreal. He went 0 for 2 with a strikeout.</TE>

<HD>Playoff Chase Is Over for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. is mathematically eliminated from
postseason play as lead evaporates in final 2:47 of a 102-100 loss to
the SuperSonics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Clippers' elimination from the playoffs became official Monday
night with a 102-100 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics.</LD>
<LD>   With Desmond Mason scoring 26 of his career-high 36 points in the
second half, the Supersonics clinched a playoff berth after missing
the postseason last season.</LD>
<LD>   Utah, which lost to Dallas on Monday, also got into the playoffs
because of the Clipper defeat.</LD>
<TE>   Disappointed Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry didn't have much to say.</TE>
<TE>   ''My team played hard and they deserve a chance to win,'' Gentry
said. ''That's all I got to say.''</TE>
<TE>   Mason said he thought the Clippers didn't handle the pressure of
the final minutes as well as the SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were a little more tight than we were because it was
do-or-die for them," said Mason, who made 16 of 22 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Mason broke a 98-98 tie with an 18-footer from the top of the key
with 18.8 seconds left, and Ansu Sesay made two free throws with 3.2
seconds left for Seattle's last points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' Eric Piatkowski made a layup in the final second.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski said the Clippers couldn't believe Mason's shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen him shoot that well before from outside," he
said. "He normally is the guy who you want him to go ahead and shoot
the ball. He kept shooting and he kept making shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked one of our assistant coaches, 'He's not supposed to be
that good an outside shooter is he?'"</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton had 22 points and 13 assists for the SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski and Elton Brand scored 22 points apiece for the
Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers led, 96-92, after a free throw by Jeff McInnis with
2:47 left.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's Predrag Drobnjak made a 14-footer with 2:24 left and Vin
Baker made a 15-footer to tie the score, 96-96.</TE>
<TE>   After Michael Olowokandi's short hook shot over Baker with 1:25 to
go, Drobnjak tied the score with a 16-footer.</TE>
<TE>   Mason scored Seattle's first 13 points of the third quarter as the
SuperSonics took a 62-57 lead with 3:25 gone in the period. Mason
finished his 19-point quarter with an 18-footer as time expired to
put Seattle ahead, 80-73.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, whose previous high was 25 points, made nine of 14 shots in
the period after having 10 points at halftime on four-for-four
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 49-49, at halftime, with Brent Barry of the
SuperSonics scoring three baskets in the final two minutes. After
Barry made a 15-footer with 42 seconds left to put Seattle ahead,
49-48, Baker fouled Brand and he made a free throw.</TE>

<LD>Clipper forward Lamar Odom, who played in only 29 games this season,
will undergo surgery today to repair damage to his injured right
wrist.</LD>

<HD>Second Chance Awaits</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After sweeping the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres, the San
Francisco Giants are the only unbeaten team in the major leagues, off
to the franchise's best start since 1930. The Giants have given up
only five runs in their first six games, tying the major league
record set by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1915.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the Dodgers are looking forward to their three-game series
against the Giants that begins tonight at Pacific Bell Park. It's the
opener of a nine-game trip that will also take them to San Diego and
Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers are coming off a sweep of their own against the
Rockies and believe they are a different team than the one outscored
by the Giants, 24-2.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to go in there and play like we did this last series
against the Rockies," Dodger outfielder Shawn Green said. "I think
it's maybe just a matter of us getting comfortable. We'll be going in
there in more of a regular-season atmosphere rather than the opening
series."</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Paul Lo Duca relishes the opportunity to play before vocal
Giant fans at Pacific Bell Park. "I love it there," Lo Duca said.
"You get ripped by everybody. They know all about you and all about
your family. They are in your ear when you go out to the on-deck
circle and you get to give it right back to them after you hit a home
run."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers will meet a Giant team that is a bit banged up. Barry
Bonds, who hit four home runs against the Dodgers last week, did not
play Sunday because of a sore hamstring. Shortstop Rich Aurilia has a
strained left groin.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers on Monday requested waivers for outfielder Tom Goodwin
and relief pitcher Mike Trombley for the purpose of giving the
players their unconditional release, expected moves that could force
the club to eat as much as $6 million in guaranteed contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Their Dodger careers effectively ended March 30 when they were
designated for assignment. Neither veteran will accept a minor league
assignment with the Dodgers. They will almost certainly go unclaimed
and become free agents Wednesday. Dodger General Manager Dan Evans
said he explored trade possibilities for both players, but "could not
find a match."</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin is owed $3.75 million. He will be paid $3.25 million for
this season with a $500,000 buyout of next season's $3.5-million
option. Trombley is owed $2.25 million. He will be paid $2 million
for this season and $250,000 to buy out his $3-million option for
next season. If the players sign minimum $200,000 contracts with
other teams, their salaries will be deducted from the amount the
Dodgers owe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek batted second in the lineup for the first time
this season against the Rockies on Sunday and had a run-scoring
single in the fourth inning. He also got hit by a pitch in the third
and scored a run. Grudzielanek, who hit second last season, will
probably return to the eighth spot tonight as center fielder and
leadoff hitter Dave Roberts returns from a day off and rookie
shortstop Cesar Izturis resumes his role as the No. 2 hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, batting .222, said he is adjusting to hitting lower
in the order in front of the pitcher. Last season, he hit .271 with
13 homers and 55 runs batted in and drew 28 walks in 539 at-bats. He
has walked twice in six games and knows the number of free passes is
likely to significantly increase.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of eight-hole hitters are going to get walked because you'd
rather have the pitcher hitting ninth try to beat you," Grudzielanek
said. "You have a couple choices. Try and broaden your strike zone
and try to hit something or possibly take the walk and see what
happens."</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Leclerc Better, but Wants More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck right wing Mike Leclerc had perfect timing in chipping a
shot past Dallas goalie Ed Belfour Sunday for his 20th goal. Matt
Cullen was equally on the ball, scurrying to retrieve the puck from
the net.</LD>
<LD>   It was a moment to savor, considering that only six other Duck
players have reached the 20-goal mark in a season. Yet, for Leclerc
it was hardly a time to be satisfied.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't reached any of my expectations yet," Leclerc said. "The
team is not in the playoff race and I haven't put up the numbers I
think I'm capable of putting up."</LD>
<TE>   Still, it is a marked improvement. Leclerc has remained healthy
for the first time in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He has 12 goals and 30 points in 46 games since Dec. 18. He also
has improved on defense, dropping his plus-minus from what was a
league-high minus-18 in December to minus-11. Leclerc not only has a
career high in goals, but in points with 44.</TE>
<TE>   His play has improved since being switched to the right wing on a
line with Cullen and German Titov.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never played right wing in my life," Leclerc said. "I kind
of like it. I see the ice better on break outs."</TE>
<TE>   That line has been productive the last two weeks. Titov has four
goals and eight points and Cullen has six assists in the last eight
games.</TE>
<TE>   "They're quick, they're moving the puck and they're really
supporting each other," Coach Bryan Murray said. "They have been our
best line. They get points and they make good plays. They are a
threat fairly regularly."</TE>
<TE>   That review is good news for Titov, who was Exhibit A in the Duck
collapse last season after signing a three-year, $4.5-million
contract. His play improved earlier this season when he was a
serviceable third-line player.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, he seems worth the money. Titov has six goals
and 12 points in the last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   "He is tough on the puck," Leclerc said. "That makes him easy to
play with. We have good chemistry on the line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck players won't be completely shut out of the playoffs this
season. Defenseman Aris Brimanis and right wing Timo Parssinen were
sent back to minor league Cincinnati, which begins the American
Hockey League playoffs this week.</TE>

<HD>Ronning, Eloranta Leave Their Marks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Allison's contributions to the Kings are obvious. Rugged and
durable, he leads the team in assists and points and has played in
every game since he was acquired in an Oct. 24 trade with the Boston
Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   But the other two players acquired by the Kings in trades this
season, Cliff Ronning and Mikko Eloranta, also have made an impact.</LD>
<LD>   Ronning, acquired March 16 in a deal with the Nashville Predators,
has quickly ingratiated himself, and not only by producing points in
four consecutive games before Monday night after going scoreless in
his first six after the trade.</LD>
<TE>   "Cliff has actually been pretty good from Day 1 here; the puck
just hasn't gone in for him," Coach Andy Murray said. "I would say in
the majority of the games he's had multiple scoring chances. But what
I've really liked about him is, he's been a really good team player.
Late in games when maybe we're protecting a lead we'll put Kelly
Buchberger in for Cliff and he'll say, 'Whatever it takes.'</TE>
<TE>   "You like to hear that. So I think he wants to win. That's the
most important thing. He's been a few years without playoff hockey,
so the most important thing for him is to come in here and play on a
winning team."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ronning: "I'm just trying to be a spoke in the wheel of a
good hockey club. If I can help in different situations, that's why
I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Eloranta, meanwhile, has produced eight goals and nine assists
while finding a niche on the checking line since coming over with
Allison in the deal that sent Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray to the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "His stock has gone up in our eyes," Andy Murray said of the
6-foot, 194-pound Finnish Olympian. "We didn't know what to think
when we first got him. I didn't know him real well as a player.</TE>
<TE>   "Must be something about those Scandinavians. They like to get
hit. He and Matty [Norstrom] get whacked more than anybody but they
just bounce up and keep going. You've got to love Mikko. He's not a
real big man, but does he ever play hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Yanick Lehoux, the Kings' third-round pick in the 2000
draft and the No. 3 scorer in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League
this season with 125 points, signed a three-year contract with the
club and today will join the Kings' American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>A 'Very Excited, Grateful' Hearn Returns Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn waited nearly four months to arrive at a game he would
call, through two operations and two rehabilitations, through
hundreds of kind letters, and through 56 Laker games, the first
without him going on four decades.</LD>
<LD>   By Monday afternoon, he had ditched his walker. He had pondered
the Lakers. He had researched the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, Hearn returns to the chair and the organization he
adores, to a microphone he once kept warm in every broadcast from
Jerry West to Kobe Bryant.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very excited and very grateful," he said with the voice and
enthusiasm that made Chick Chick and, often enough, the Lakers the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   As it drew near, he said Monday, his comeback gradually became
less about his health and more about the job, and more about the
game. The limousine will carry him and his wife, Marge, out of
Encino, to Staples Center, so that it all can happen again, as though
the routine never paused for heart surgery and then hip-replacement
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of coming back, after you miss 50-something games,
that's a while," said Hearn, who visited the Laker locker room before
their recent trip. "I've missed the familiarity of it. But the
reception I got from the players when I was there brought me up
tremendously.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I missed the camaraderie of the coaching staff and the
players and the press. There's a bond that develops when you're there
every day. It gets to be routine."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said he was feeling well enough to travel with the club on
its final regular-season trip--next weekend to Portland--and also
through the playoffs. But he'll start with one game, one night and,
for sure, one very large reception.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll feel it," he said. "I hope I deserve it. And I hope I can
keep at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal apparently suffered no complications in his right
wrist after playing Sunday against the Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out the middle two of a four-game trip to allow a sprain to
improve, then wrapped his wrist and had 40 points and 11 rebounds in
41 minutes, most against Alonzo Mourning.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is expected to play tonight, which, as Rick Fox insisted,
is a good thing for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to admit you're a mediocre team without him," Fox
said, "but that's the truth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again the Lakers have played just well enough to finish among
the leaders in the Western Conference, and just poorly enough to make
everyone believe they're vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the Lakers aren't particularly worried, not when
O'Neal plays the way he did Sunday on extended rest.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to keep the spot where we're at...." O'Neal said.
"Just play with each other. We didn't have the No. 1 spot last year,
either, and last year was pretty fun in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want it the easy way anyway. We want to have different
ways of winning it. It's all about blood, sweat and tears."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, maybe they'll play hard enough to finish ahead of
the Dallas Mavericks, just for laughs.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, Mavericks and Spurs, ranked two through four in the
conference, are separated by one game. The Lakers own the first
tiebreaker with both teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will host a fund-raiser Friday at the new Palm restaurant
in downtown Los Angeles to benefit Kidz Educational Experience, the
Odessa Chambliss Foundation and the Staples Center Foundation.

<DH>Golf: Alterations at Augusta National could be tailor-made
for Woods in the Masters, which begins this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The azaleas bloomed a little early this year, so they're looking a
little ragged, but chances are you aren't going to be able to say
that about Tiger Woods. This is Masters week and Woods is the
defending champion and he might turn the whole thing into a
coming-out party ... again.</LD>
<LD>   Woods played a practice round two weeks ago at Augusta National.
He flew into town with Mark O'Meara, flew out that night and kept the
whole thing about as hush-hush as he could. He said no one kept
score, but that's not going to be the case starting Thursday when the
Masters begins at the newly lengthened and beefed-up layout.</LD>
<LD>   Woods downplayed the impromptu practice round.</LD>
<TE>   "We just slapped it around and took a good look at the holes,"
said Woods, who played another practice round Monday and was followed
by a horde of fans and media.</TE>
<TE>   Nine holes have been altered and nearly 300 yards were added to
Augusta National, and the changes are certain to draw most of the
pre-tournament attention.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he may hit a three-wood or two-iron instead of driver
at No. 7, depending on the wind. At the par-five 13th, which had 25
yards added to it, the strategy still calls for a three-wood so he
can better control the flight of the ball around the corner of the
dogleg left.</TE>
<TE>   And at the 465-yard 18th, which has been lengthened 60 yards,
Woods said the play is still driver off the tee. But with 305 yards
to a bunker on the left and trees on the right, he will have to be
accurate. Woods expects to have a six-iron or seven-iron left to the
green. Last year during the last round, he hit a driver and a sand
wedge.</TE>
<TE>   The par-four 11th may be the hole most changed, Woods said,
because the tee was not only moved back 35 yards, but also shifted to
the right, bringing the water to the left of the green into play
again.</TE>
<TE>   Woods said he has no problem with a more difficult Augusta
National. But be prepared for a barrage of player comments about the
changes to the course, the most significant alterations to the layout
since the first Masters in 1934. Most of the players arrived Monday
and all have practice rounds scheduled today, when remarks on the
redesign are sure to intensify.</TE>
<TE>   Off the course, Woods also is making news. His new girlfriend,
21-year-old Swedish model Elin Nordegren, also is in town and will
appear with him in public for the first time at the Golf Writers
Assn. of America awards dinner Wednesday night, where Woods will
accept the player-of-the-year award. Nordegren met Woods last summer
when she was working as a nanny for Jesper Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   Woods also is making food news. He said he went 48 days without
eating red meat on a bet with his friends in which former Stanford
teammate Jerry Chang and others gave up French fries, bread and beer.
As host of the champions dinner tonight, Woods is in charge of the
menu. He came up with sashimi, steaks, grilled chicken breasts,
mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Woods also could set the menu next year, depending how well things
go this week. He's playing well enough--he won Bay Hill three weeks
ago, tied for 14th at the Players Championship and took last week
off. But Woods also has history working against him. The only players
who have won consecutive Masters are Jack Nicklaus (1965-66) and Nick
Faldo (1989-90).</TE>

<HD>Astros' Biggio Hits for the Cycle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>With a single, triple and home run in his first three at-bats, Craig
Biggio knew what he had to do.</LD>
<LD>   After being walked intentionally in his next plate appearance,
Biggio lined a two-run double down the left-field line, completing
the cycle and helping the Houston Astros to an 8-4 victory Monday in
the Colorado Rockies' home opener.</LD>
<LD>   Biggio, who drove in four runs, put the Astros ahead, 8-1, with
his double in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, you know what you need," Biggio said of his last at-bat.
"But the last thing you're trying to do is hit a double. I was just
trying to hit the ball hard. That's what I'm trying to do every time
up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a special day. It's a lucky day when something like that
happens. I caught a couple of breaks with the ball staying inside the
line [on his double and triple]. It's kind of cool."</TE>
<TE>   Biggio, who entered the game hitting .174 (four for 23), went four
for four with a two-run homer, triple, two-run double and single to
raise his average to .296. It was the first cycle of his 13-year
career and the sixth in Astro history.</TE>

<HD>Kenseth Victory Is Really the Pits</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: He starts race from the back of the pack, but
gets out first after last caution flag to win Samsung/Radio Shack
500.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>Tough as it was to pass at Texas Motor Speedway on Monday, Matt
Kenseth knew there was only one sure place to take the lead for
good--in the pits, under the last caution flag.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to make it so the race would be mine to lose," Kenseth
said after winning the Samsung/Radio Shack 500, which had been
postponed because of rain Sunday. "I wanted to see what I could do
from up there."</LD>
<LD>   So he had his crew change only two tires. Most other top
contenders did the same. But Kenseth's crew gave him a bonus, getting
him out of the pits in first place, just ahead of Jeff Gordon.</LD>
<TE>   "I was worried about my restart, and whether Jeff might get under
me in the first few laps of green [when the race went green with 22
laps to go]," Kenseth said.</TE>
<TE>   But he quickly found he could hold off Gordon, his only late
challenger, with greater ease as the laps waned. It was a pleasant
feeling indeed for Kenseth, who'd been forced to start last in the
43-car field for changing engines in his Ford after qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got a little cushion, I felt pretty good about it," said
Kenseth, a 30-year-old driver who collected his second victory of
this, his third Winston Cup season. "It was tough to be behind
somebody today."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon agreed. "It's all about getting clean air to the nose of
the car," he said, referring to the aerodynamic phenomenon drivers
call "aero push."</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth explained: "When you get behind somebody it takes all the
downforce off the front."</TE>
<TE>   That is, the lead car diverts onrushing air so that not much
streams down onto the second car's nose and hood. That causes the
front to lose traction.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't hold the front tires down, so it's hard to turn,"
Kenseth said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Martin rushed up to challenge for second place, but Gordon
held on.</TE>
<TE>   "[As that last caution ended] I thought I might have a shot at
Matt," Gordon said. "But he was out in clean air, so as long as he
ran his line, I couldn't pass him. It was the same thing when Mark
caught me. He couldn't pass me once he got to me."</TE>
<TE>   But aero push is chronic virtually everywhere on the Cup tour
nowadays. Drivers had feared it would be virtually impossible to pass
here, because of a repaving job that, they figured, would make Texas
Motor Speedway a one-groove track.</TE>
<TE>   The new surface proved to be more forgiving, making for a cleaner
and less-harrowing race than drivers had anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all worried about this being a one-groove track," Kenseth
said. "But the outside groove came in really quickly--which I never
dreamed it would. It wasn't that bad to pass at first. After that
first mandatory pit stop [called by NASCAR officials after 35 laps,
to check tire wear on the new surface] we got out of the pits in 15th
place.</TE>
<TE>   "But once I got into the top 10, it was really difficult to pass.
[On the final pit stop] I knew three or four others were going to
take only two tires. And I knew if we got behind 'em, there was no
way we could come back and win the race."</TE>
<TE>   There were seven cautions in the race, which was attended by a
crowd estimated at 180,000, but no serious injuries. The hardest
crash occurred when Dale Earnhardt Jr. was clipped by Shawna Robinson
as he tried to lap her. Earnhardt's car spun and slammed into the
wall backward, but he walked away from the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a lot of guys used their heads," Gordon said,
referring to the drivers' apprehension about the new surface. "That's
good. As fast as we're going around this place [nearly 200 mph in
places], you'd better."</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth strengthened his second position in the Winston Cup point
standings, cutting the deficit on leader Sterling Marlin by 29
points, to only 70. Marlin finished seventh Monday.</TE>

<HD>Stackhouse, Pistons Clinch Division Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Stackhouse knows that his Detroit Pistons are capable of
winning more than a division championship.</LD>
<LD>   Monday, though, taking that first step was cause for a party.</LD>
<LD>   Stackhouse had 18 points and 12 assists, one short of a career
high, as the Pistons clinched their first Central Division title
since the 1989-90 NBA championship team by beating the Atlanta Hawks,
105-99, Monday night at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   "This is just an unbelievable feeling," Stackhouse said. "We came
from nowhere last year to win a division title. There are a lot of
players who have never done that."</TE>
<TE>   Even with Stackhouse's effort, the night belonged to Zeljko
Rebraca, who had career highs with 18 points, 13 rebounds and seven
blocks. The Yugoslav rookie replaced injured the Ben Wallace--who
leads the league in blocks and rebounds -- and helped Detroit pull
within two games of New Jersey for the best record in the Eastern
Conference. Wallace sat out with a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great opportunity for me, and I wanted to play my best
game," he said. "I told Ben before the game that I had to do his job,
and that's what I did. Now we are the champs."</TE>
<TE>   Chucky Atkins led the Pistons with 20 points, and Cliff Robinson
had 19.</TE>
<TE>   "We can celebrate tonight, because this is a tremendous
achievement that no one expected these guys to do," Piston Coach Rick
Carlisle said. "Tomorrow, we'll start thinking about the Chicago game
on Wednesday and about catching New Jersey. The first priority is to
get Ben healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 105, Utah 96--Nick Van Exel and Michael Finley each heated
up in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 points, leading the
Mavericks at Salt Lake City. Despite the loss, the Jazz clinched a
playoff spot when Seattle beat the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas won without leading scorer and rebounder Dirk Nowitzki, who
had 10 points when he rolled his left ankle with 1:54 before halftime
and limped to the dressing room. He didn't return for the second half
after straining the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, Portland 87--After the Trail Blazers Portland
trimmed a 29-point deficit down to six late in the fourth quarter,
Tim Duncan knocked down a turnaround jumper to help the Spurs hang on
at San Antonio. Duncan led the Spurs with 24 points and eight
rebounds. His only basket of the fourth quarter was a 10-footer over
Rasheed Wallace to put the Spurs up, 95-87, with 1:28 left.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 83, Houston 74--Tracy McGrady scored eight of his 22
points in the last 4:55 as the Magic won at Orlando, Fla. Troy Hudson
scored 19 points, and his three-pointer with 1:04 remaining capped a
16-1 run that sealed the Magic's 10th consecutive home victory.
Orlando can clinch a postseason berth with a victory at New York
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 105, Boston 100--Trenton Hassell banked in a three-point
shot and Travis Best made two free throws, all in the final minute,
to lead the Bulls at Chicago. Antoine Walker, who finished with 33
points, missed an off-balance three-point shot with three seconds
left. Best made two free throws with under one second left to clinch
it.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 100, Golden State 93--Wally Szczerbiak scored 21 points
and Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 12 rebounds as the Timberwolves
won at Oakland. All five starters scored in double figures for the
Timberwolves, who won for the sixth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 111, Indiana 99--Ricky Davis scored 32 points and the
Cavaliers limited Indiana to five baskets in the final 18 minutes at
Indianapolis.</TE>

<HD>Pollin Says Jordan Will Return</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owner of the Washington Wizards said he expects Michael Jordan to
return next season and that his comeback was a "great success," even
though a knee injury cut short his season.</LD>
<LD>   "He has a two-year contract and he told me he plans to fulfill it,
subject to his health," Abe Pollin said at the NBA Board of Governors
meeting. "If he's healthy, he'll be there."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Jordan, 39, said he wouldn't play again this season
because of his chronically sore knees.</LD>
<TE>   He said he intended to fulfill his contract if his knees improved.</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte Hornets reportedly have been violating NBA policy by
under-reporting home attendance, making it appear paid attendance at
the team's games is the lowest in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Charlotte Observer said in today's editions that according to
records kept at the Charlotte Coliseum, the Hornets under-reported
attendance for more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   The change in reporting comes as the Hornets lobby the league for
a move to New Orleans. Among other things, the team has argued it is
not being supported in Charlotte.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Mariners Dealing With Expectations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 58, Lou Piniella is still too young to be classified as the
Ancient Mariner, but he understands the potential albatross of great
expectations, the relentless comparisons that his Seattle Mariners
face after winning 116 games last year, tying the major league record
set by the Chicago Cubs in 1906.</LD>
<LD>   He understands, and cautions that duplicating 116 is virtually
impossible--"there's a reason it happens only once every 95 years,"
the Seattle manager said in his Edison Field office before Monday
night's opener of a four-game series with the Angels--and he
understands, and cautions that the American League West may now be
baseball's best.</LD>
<LD>   "Our job is to win the division with whatever [win] total that
takes," Piniella said. "We want to get back to the playoffs [for the
third straight year] and take that next step by knocking down that
last door [to the World Series].</LD>
<TE>   "I said it in the spring and I'll say it now, it's going to be
tougher. We're a little bit of a marked team now. We've seen already
that teams are visibly excited when they beat us."</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's only the second week of the new season and the marked
Mariners came to Anaheim with a 3-3 record as they try to reestablish
the momentum of their 20-4 start last season.</TE>
<TE>   They are essentially operating with the same core, although there
have been several significant changes.</TE>
<TE>   James Baldwin has replaced Aaron Sele in the rotation. Jeff
Cirillo has replaced David Bell at third base. Ruben Sierra has
replaced Al Martin as the part-time left fielder. Shigetoshi Hasegawa
has replaced Jose Paniagua in the bullpen. Ben Davis has replaced Tom
Lampkin as the backup catcher.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Jay Buhner, a big part of the clubhouse camaraderie,
retired, and Norm Charlton was lost for the season because of an
injury.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Charlton, coupled with the decision to keep Rule 5
infielder Luis Ugueto, has left Arthur Rhodes as the only left-hander
in the Mariner bullpen, limiting Piniella's maneuverability.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Bret Boone reflected on the changes and said, "This
team can be as good, if not better, than last year, but we're not
sitting here thinking about winning 116 games again. I think you can
count that out. Without sounding corny, last year was unbelievable,
almost magical, and I came to understand how important chemistry is.
I think it's a key reason the Yankees have been so good, and it
certainly contributed to the type of season we had. That's not to say
it won't be there, or isn't there, this year, but every year is
different, and this one is just starting."</TE>
<TE>   A team in the true sense last year, there were more components to
Seattle's season for the ages than can be found in an electronics
catalog.</TE>
<TE>   None were more vital than the catalytic charge generated by Ichiro
Suzuki at the top of the lineup and Boone in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   If no one could have predicted 116 wins, no one was predicting
that the Mariners would sustain an offense that led the league in
runs and average.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki won the batting title and the league's rookie and
most-valuable-player awards. Boone, playing for his fourth team in
four years, authored his own season for the ages--the most productive
by a second baseman in league history.</TE>
<TE>   He set AL records for a second baseman with 37 homers and a
league-high 141 runs batted in. He became the first second baseman in
league history to hit more than 30 homers and bat above .300 (.331).</TE>
<TE>   A prolific lineup provided the opportunities and Boone took
advantage of them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he insists, there is no pressure to duplicate those 141 RBIs,
nor does he have a prediction.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I feel confident about is that I have turned the
corner and can perform at a similarly consistent level for several
years," he said. "Whether that means 110 or 120 or 150 RBI, who
knows? A lot depends on the team and the opportunities. I'm proud of
what I did last year. It's there on paper, and no one can take it
away, but I can't dwell on it. I can't live off it. I've been at the
top and at the bottom. I know how humbling the game is."</TE>
<TE>   One of Piniella's primary tasks this year will be to monitor the
duplication meter, to make sure Boone or Suzuki or any of the other
key Mariners aren't pressing, trying to match their production of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The message I gave [Boone and Suzuki] in the spring is that same
message I gave the whole team," Piniella said. "We had a great year
last year but don't try to duplicate it, don't try to compare this
year to last year, just relax and play."</TE>
<TE>   It's a familiar message in baseball, but Piniella knows it's
easier said than done. "That's why so many teams travel with
psychologists now," he said. "If I had ever told George Steinbrenner
[during Piniella's career as player and manager with the Yankees]
that I needed to see a psychologist, he'd have said, 'Get out of here
before I chase you out.'''</TE>
<TE>   There is no shingle hanging on the Mariner clubhouse door, only
those pervasive expectations behind it.</TE>
<TE>   Boone, for instance, carries the weight of his historic season and
a three-year, $25-million contract he signed in the off-season when,
like Barry Bonds, he encountered an inexplicably cold free-agent
market and had no alternative other than returning to his 2001 team.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki carries the weight of his adopted U.S. city and Japanese
homeland, of which several media representatives told Piniella during
spring training that they expected him to hit 30 home runs this year
with a more uppercut spring. They were evicted from his office.</TE>
<TE>   "How does he exceed what he did last year?" Piniella said in
Anaheim. "If he even comes close, I'll be pleased."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the manager said, expanding on the message he has
given his players, "Strive for consistency and stay within yourself.
That should ensure a nice season."</TE>
<TE>   Nice? The Mariners are coming off a season far better than nice,
and the reminders may be hard to escape.</TE>

<HD>Indiana's Jeffries Adds His Name to NBA Draft</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jared Jeffries, a 6-foot-10 sophomore forward who helped lead Indiana
to the NCAA championship game, added his name to the NBA draft on
Monday, forgoing his final two years of college eligibility.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffries was the Big Ten's player of the year and a second-team
All-American.</LD>
<LD>   He led the Hoosiers in scoring and rebounding, averaging 15.0
points and 7.6 rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Jeffries dismissed any possibility of pulling his name out of the
draft. Players can withdraw until June 19 if they do not sign with an
agent. Jeffries said his decision was final --and that he would
choose an agent in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries has been projected as a top-15 pick in the June draft. He
consulted with NBA team officials in the last week, but declined to
say how high he expected to be drafted.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Virginia guard Roger Mason Jr., who led the Cavaliers in
scoring as a junior last season, said he will make himself eligible
for the draft.</TE>

<TE>   After eschewing for years the idea of playing what USC termed
"meaningless" nonconference basketball games the weekend after
meeting UCLA, the Trojans have reversed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   USC will play host to Pennsylvania of the Ivy League on Jan. 11,
2003, two days after playing UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, and travel to
Nevada Las Vegas to face the Runnin' Rebels on Feb. 8, less than 48
hours after playing the Bruins at the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' game against UNLV will be broadcast on ABC and is the
first in a home-and-home series with the Rebels, as they will come to
Los Angeles during the 2003-04 season.</TE>

<TE>   Kremer beat Hopkins, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, in the first match of the day
on the Stadium Court of the Amelia Island Plantation facility. Kremer
had 16 double faults, and Hopkins finished with 13 service

<TE>   It was discovered that the service court area back line was 18
feet from the net, three feet short of the normal distance. WTA
officials announced that the match result would stand with Kremer as

<HD>It's a Wild Night as Sharks Fall on Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Wild are still stuck in last place as their second
season winds down, but the signs of improvement are showing.</LD>
<LD>   Pascal Dupuis, Richard Park and Sergei Zholtok scored, and the
Wild beat San Jose, 3-1, Monday night at St. Paul, Minn. to prevent
the Sharks from moving into second place in the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Manny Fernandez, who shut out the Sharks in November, made 18
saves for Minnesota, which ended a five-game losing streak with its
26th victory--one more than the Wild's final total last season.</LD>
<TE>   Fernandez was hopeful Minnesota can become a legitimate playoff
contender next season.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do have a chance next year, it would be great," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Marleau stretched his goal-scoring streak to five games
for the Sharks, who dropped to 0-2-2 this season against Minnesota,
which is last in the Northwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   "We blew two points we needed tonight," said defenseman Brad
Stuart. "It's disappointing to have a game like this--a game we
really want to win and solidify our spot."</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks trail Northwest Division leader Colorado by one point
with three games each to play. San Jose plays at Columbus on
Wednesday and St. Louis on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks finish the regular season at home Saturday against the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "They clogged us and wouldn't let us get our feet going. We didn't
start doing anything until the third," said right wing Todd Harvey.
"We'll have to look back on this game and kick ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Wild, eliminated from the playoff race more than a week ago,
looked more like the team fighting for postseason positioning. San
Jose missed a chance to set a franchise record for points and remains
at 95.</TE>
<TE>   On a power play in the first period, Dupuis scored on a rebound
for a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks tied a season low with only two shots on goal in the
second period, and the Wild made it 2-0 at 6:42 when Park scored his
10th goal on a pass from Zholtok.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Columbus 1--Alexander Mogilny had a goal and an assist
at Toronto in the Maple Leafs' final regular-season home game. Jyrki
Lumme, Robert Reichel and Bryan McCabe also scored for Toronto, which
moved into sole possession of fourth place in the Eastern Conference,
two points ahead of idle Ottawa. Both teams have three games left.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Philadelphia 4--Pierre Dagenais scored his second goal
with 16.6 seconds left in the third period to give the Panthers a tie
at Philadelphia. Philadelphia pulled within three points of the
Eastern Conference-leading Boston Bruins. Each team has three games
left.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, New York Islanders 1-- Rod Brind'Amour scored early in
the third period to help the Hurricanes win at Uniondale, N.Y. The
Hurricanes need one point to clinch the Southeast Division title.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 3, Pittsburgh 2--Pavel Bure scored two goals and
Eric Lindros added another at New York as the Rangers won their fifth
consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Fading Stars May Get an Overhaul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dallas Stars aren't done yet, but based on their lackluster
effort in a 3-0 defeat to the Kings Monday night, they should get
their golf clubs ready.</LD>
<LD>   After winning five consecutive Pacific Division titles, the Stars
have become a shadow of their former selves this season as they
remain two points out of the Western Conference's eighth and final
playoff spot.</LD>
<LD>   But do you think the Kings really care?</LD>
<TE>   Probably not. Remember, it wasn't too long ago when the Stars made
the Kings' world a miserable one. From Nov. 8, 1995 to Jan. 26, 2000,
Los Angeles went 22 consecutive games against Dallas without a
victory, so adding one more nail in the Stars' coffin shouldn't be a
problem for the Kings, who have their sights on bigger and better
things.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Stars rally and sneak into the playoffs--and avoid
missing the postseason for the first time since 1996--this has been a
season to forget for the 1999 Stanley Cup champions. Dallas and its
$57-million payroll started the season losing, then fired Ken
Hitchcock as coach, made a few mini-runs along with a late trade and
now the Stars are losing again under interim Coach Rick Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   With Monday's loss to the Kings, Dallas dropped to 2-5-1-1 over
its last nine games, including a weak loss to the Mighty Ducks on
Sunday. Not the type of play associated with a team fighting for the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually we're the ones getting teams frustrated and our goals are
the ones that come," said Dallas center Kirk Muller after the Stars
recorded only two shots on goal in the second period on Monday.
"We're just not in control like we generally are."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Stars do make the playoffs, expect some changes in the
Lone Star state this summer. Word has it that management has an eye
on former Star and current Montreal assistant Guy Carbonneau to take
over for Wilson next season.</TE>
<TE>   If Dallas does decide to make this move, Carbonneau will have his
work cut out because there are plenty of teams in the West who would
love nothing else than to keep the Stars down.</TE>
<TE>   NHL Awards</TE>
<TE>   With less than a week remaining in the regular season, ballots are
being filled out for the league's individual awards. Here's a look at
the individuals I think should win:</TE>
<TE>   * Hart Trophy (to the player "judged the most valuable to his
team").</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Jarome Iginla is not only the league's leading goal
scorer with 51, he's on pace to become the first Ross Trophy winner
to have more goals than assists since Bobby Hull did it for Chicago
in 1965-66.</TE>
<TE>   But there are those who say Iginla should not become the first
player of color to take home the league's most-valuable-player award
because the Flames are not in the playoffs. That's a bunch of hockey
sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla, the league's lone 50-plus goal scorer, has had a
remarkable season. He scores 25% of Calgary's goals and has a hand in
nearly 43% of the Flames' total offense. Iginla is as tough as they
come and he's in the top 10 in plus/minus despite playing on a team
that has been outscored all season.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla gets the nod over Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, who's having
a solid season with the league's best goals-against average, but
there are some holes in his bid too. Roy is not even a clear-cut
choice over Montreal's Jose Theodore for the Vezina Trophy, and is he
a more valuable player than his teammate Joe Sakic?</TE>
<TE>   Even without Roy, the Avalanche would probably still make the
playoffs. Without Iginla, the Flames would be looking up at the
Mighty Ducks and probably fighting with Atlanta for the title of the
league's worst team.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Roy, Detroit's Brendan Shanahan and Theodore.</TE>
<TE>   * Norris Trophy (defenseman who "demonstrates throughout the
season the greatest all-around ability in the position").</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom separated himself from the pack by
taking a late-season break. With Lidstrom resting a sore groin in
Detroit (wink, wink), the Red Wings got waxed on a three-game West
Coast trip last week. Detroit sorely missed the smooth puck-moving
defender in going 0-2-1 against the Ducks, Kings and San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chelios should get consideration with his eye-opening
league-leading plus/minus rating, but Lidstrom is the main
quarterback behind the Red Wing system and should pick up his second
consecutive Norris.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Chelios, Colorado's Rob Blake and Washington's Sergei
Gonchar.</TE>
<TE>   * Adams Trophy (coach "judged to have contributed the most to his
team's success").</TE>
<TE>   Of all the postseason honors this will be the closest competition
because so many coaches have done an outstanding job.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix's Bob Francis has gotten more out of his team than anyone
expected. Boston's Robbie Ftorek will gain votes for turning the
Bruins into one of the best in the East and the Sutter brothers
(Chicago's Brian and San Jose's Darryl) have certainly gotten the job
done with their teams.</TE>
<TE>   But my vote goes to Detroit's Scotty Bowman, whose Red Wings
clinched the President's Trophy with nearly a month to go in the
regular season. Bowman has a long list of all-stars to work with, but
teams feared the Red Wings because of the way he has his players
working together.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman has a chance to become the first person to coach nine
Stanley Cup championship teams, but he has been named coach of the
year only twice. This should be the year he adds a third.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Ftorek, Francis, Brian Sutter and Darryl Sutter.</TE>
<TE>   * Vezina Trophy ("to the goaltender judged to be the best at his
position").</TE>
<TE>   Roy is on pace to set a career-best with his 1.94 goals-against
average and his nine shutouts are already a personal high. That says
a lot about the type of season the future Hall of Famer has had and
should be enough to earn him his first Vezina since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Roy may not have dominated every night, but he gets the slight
edge over Theodore. Roy has a better goals-against average and more
victories and shutouts than Theodore, who has a better save
percentage. But you can make a good case for Theodore because without
him, Montreal wouldn't be in the playoff picture.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Theodore, Detroit's Dominik Hasek and Phoenix's Sean
Burke.</TE>
<TE>   * Calder Trophy ("to the player selected as the most proficient in
his first year").</TE>
<TE>   Since training camp, Atlanta had the league's top two rookies in
forwards Dany Heatley and Ilya Kovalchuk. It was a toss-up trying to
decide which player was the most proficient until goal scorer
Kovalchuk went down with a season-ending injury in March, leaving
Heatley for the Calder.</TE>
<TE>   Heatley has been a quality playmaker all season and has scored
enough goals to still have more than Florida rookie Kristian
Huselius. Detroit's Pavel Datsyuk stepped up late in the season and
Colorado's Radim Vrbata has also played well. But the easy choice is
Heatley.</TE>
<TE>   Runners-up: Kovalchuk, Huselius, Datsyuk and Vrbata.</TE>

<HD>Koivu to Play for Canadiens</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Captain Saku Koivu will rejoin the Montreal Canadiens for their game
tonight, completing a comeback from stomach cancer diagnosed in
September.</LD>
<LD>   The 27-year-old Koivu said in February the cancer was in full
remission and he hoped to return by the end of the season. He has
been practicing with the Canadiens in recent weeks, and the team said
he will be in the lineup for today's home game against the Ottawa
Senators.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadiens are vying for a playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference. They also have games Friday in New Jersey and at home
Saturday against Buffalo to close out the regular season.</LD>
<TE>   Koivu had chemotherapy treatment to combat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
He had 17 goals and 30 assists in 54 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky will have surgery to alleviate
pain in his back and his neck.</TE>
<TE>   "I was supposed to be on medication for a few days and bed rest
and obviously I couldn't do that," Gretzky said from Calgary, where
the Phoenix Coyotes play the Flames tonight.</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set for the surgery. Gretzky, who owns the
Coyotes, has two herniated disks in his back and has trouble turning
his neck.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI Friday indicated the surgery should be expedited.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something I didn't know about, but at least I don't have
to get out there and get banged around," Gretzky said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An angry crowd reaction to a ruling reversal by the umpire crew
briefly halted the Florida Marlins' home opener. There was no
stopping Michael Barrett and the Montreal Expos.</LD>
<LD>   The crew's reversal negated a three-run homer by Florida's Mike
Lowell, and Barrett's homer and career-high five runs batted in
helped Montreal win, 10-2, Monday night at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Play was halted for seven minutes in the fourth inning when fans
upset about the reversal threw magnetic schedules--promotional
handouts--and other items onto the field.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought the game was going to be ended due to a riot," Barrett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell's apparent homer to left temporarily made the score 3-3.
When third base umpire Chuck Meriwether called the ball fair,
Montreal Manager Frank Robinson and left fielder Brad Wilkerson
argued. Meriwether then consulted with the other umpires and was
overruled by second base umpire Tim McClelland, the crew chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the ball foul," McClelland said. "In order for me to
overrule it, I have to be 100% certain."</TE>
<TE>   A TV replay showed the ball hooked foul, passing outside the foul
pole as it barely cleared the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg sprinted onto the field to argue and
was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Said Torborg: "I was just complaining that the guy closest to the
play was overruled."</TE>
<TE>   When Torborg departed, fans showered the field with objects, and
the umpires ordered players off the field.</TE>
<TE>   When the game resumed, Lowell grounded into an inning-ending
double play and the crowd booed again.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Arizona 0--Phil Nevin and D'Angelo Jimenez each hit
two-run homers for the Padres at San Diego. Arizona committed five
errors, tying the club record set against Houston on June 27, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Lawrence (1-0) pitched a four-hitter for his first career
shutout and second complete game. He retired 13 in a row during one
stretch, struck out four, walked one and allowed only one runner to
reach third base.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 2, Philadelphia 1--Kevin Millwood struck out eight and
pitched into the eighth inning and John Smoltz pitched out of trouble
in the ninth to lead the Braves at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Marlon Anderson started the ninth with a double to right-center
off Smoltz and moved to third on Bobby Abreu's infield single. But
Smoltz got Scott Rolen to pop out to second before fanning Travis Lee
and Pat Burrell for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 1, Cincinnati 0--Ron Villone gave up four hits in 71/3
innings and Brian Giles--who had doubled--scored on Aramis Ramirez's
sacrifice fly in the sixth to help the Pirates win their fifth in a
row and first home opener since 1993.</TE>

<HD>Bobsledder Johnson Has 2 Suspensions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gea Johnson, who finished fifth in the Salt Lake Winter Games in the
bobsled, has been slapped in recent years with two doping-related
suspensions--the second little-known and testament to the
complexities inherent in sports' anti-doping rules.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson's first suspension has been well documented. The
International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world
governing agency, suspended the 1990 NCAA heptathlon champion from
Arizona after she tested positive in December 1994, for anabolic
steroids.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson denied wrongdoing, then won an injunction from a federal
judge that allowed her to compete in the 1996 Olympic trials. She did
not make the team. She switched to weightlifting and soon became
world class. Before the 2000 Summer Games, she switched back to
heptathlon training but suffered an injury. After recovering, she won
a spot on the 2002 U.S. bobsledding team.</LD>
<TE>   Days before the Salt Lake Games, USA Weightlifting posted on its
Web site the announcement that Johnson had accepted--retroactively--a
two-year suspension dating from an April 1997 test that found she had
an elevated level of epitestosterone. Johnson denied wrongdoing but
agreed to forfeit all results during those years.</TE>
<TE>   Epitestosterone is a naturally occurring steroid. It can be used
to mask use of testosterone, which can enhance strength. But the Web
site announcement made a point of noting that Johnson's testosterone
levels were "not elevated," suggesting there was no evidence of
masking.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to explain the elevated epitestosterone level, Johnson's
attorney, Adam Driggs, said: "One of our problems was that this was
an April 1997 test and [USA Weightlifting] didn't even deem it a
positive until June 2000. How can Gea go back over 31/2 years to
re-create what was the matter with her body at that time?"</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said, "I got accused of doing nothing. I had to accept
that deal, or they were going to try to keep me out of the Olympics."</TE>

<HD>Angels, Salmon Get No Relief</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Struggling right fielder is booed after costly
error, and bullpen turns 3-0 lead into 5-4 loss to Mariners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners appear mortal this season, a very good team but
a beatable one. The Angels should have beaten the Mariners Monday
night, but they lost in an ugly fashion that revealed two of their
potential flaws.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners scored two runs in the seventh inning and three more
in the eighth, posting a 5-4 victory that left the Angels with
alarming questions about whether their bullpen can withstand the loss
of closer Troy Percival and whether right fielder Tim Salmon can
rebound from his disastrous 2001 season.</LD>
<LD>   With bullpen roles jumbled while Percival rehabilitates a strained
rib cage, Donne Wall, Ben Weber and Mark Lukasiewicz gave up six hits
in a span of 11 batters in the seventh and eighth innings, turning a
shutout into defeat before 16,908 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence in our bullpen," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "There aren't going to be many nights like this one."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, whose terrific spring raised hope that last season was an
aberration, looked shaky in the field and did not get the ball out of
the infield in four at-bats. In six games this season, Salmon is
hitting .143, with three hits and seven strikeouts in 21 at-bats. In
five games in right field, he has committed two errors.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he is "absolutely not" worried that Salmon might be
no better this season than last. On defense, Scioscia said, "I don't
have any concerns." On offense, Scioscia said, Salmon starts slowly
even in the best of times.</TE>
<TE>   "His bat speed is totally different than it was last year,"
Scioscia said. "This is a more typical starting pattern for Tim, as
opposed to what happened last year."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was booed three times by the fans who stood by him during
his miserable season last summer. In the fifth inning, he charged an
apparently catchable fly ball hit by Jeff Cirillo, then abruptly
stopped and safely played the ball on the short hop. In the seventh,
with two on and one out, he tapped a grounder back to the pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   The boos grew loudest in the eighth inning, when the Mariners
scored the tying run on an error by Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels led, 4-2, after seven innings, but Bret Boone led off
the eighth with a home run. Ruben Sierra doubled, and Charles Gipson
ran for him. Carlos Guillen singled to right field, and Salmon
reached the ball quickly enough that Gipson held at third. But then
Salmon bobbled and booted the ball for an error, allowing Gipson to
score the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Cirillo eventually drove home Guillen with the winning run, on a
sacrifice fly off Al Levine, the fifth Angel pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game against his old team, Shigetoshi Hasegawa earned
the victory in relief.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhiro Sasaki recorded the save, marking the first time in major
league history that Japanese-born pitchers got the victory and the
save for the same team in the same game.</TE>
<TE>   Angel starter Jarrod Washburn departed in the sixth inning with a
shutout intact, a statistic that suggests he was dominating on a
night when he was anything but.</TE>
<TE>   He needed 91 pitches to last five innings on opening night, and
the pitch count Monday was every bit as unimpressive--94 through five
innings, 100 when the Angels removed him with one out in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle got nine hits off Washburn, and two walks, but the
Mariners ran themselves out of two innings and failed to produce a
clutch hit.</TE>
<TE>   And, in the fifth, Washburn preserved his shutout on guts. The
Mariners loaded the bases with none out, on two singles and a walk.
Coming up: Boone, the No. 3 hitter, and then Edgar Martinez, the
cleanup hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Boone struck out. Martinez grounded into a double play.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics suggest Seattle's Paul Abbott pitched a decent
game, giving up four runs in 61/3 innings. The statistics do not take
into account the extremely trying personal circumstances under which
Abbott pitched, circumstances that rendered his performance
impressive.</TE>

<HD>Repent Is Lost for the Derby and Beyond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Repent, the Louisiana Derby winner and one of the top contenders for
next month's Kentucky Derby, won't run at Churchill Downs or in the
other two Triple Crown races, his trainer, Ken McPeek, said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A distant second, 61/2 lengths behind War Emblem, as the 1-2
favorite in Saturday's Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park, Repent
apparently injured himself in that race. McPeek said that X-rays
taken Monday showed that Repent had a small bone chip in the ankle on
his left foreleg. The colt will undergo arthroscopic surgery Monday,
with the recuperation time estimated at two to three months. The
Triple Crown, which starts with the Kentucky Derby on May 4 and
includes the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, is a grueling series run
over five weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Repent's injury leaves McPeek with one--and possibly two--solid
Derby candidates. If Harlan's Holiday adds to his Florida Derby win
with a victory Saturday in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, he
will be the Kentucky Derby favorite. McPeek also trains Take Charge
Lady, a filly that had been penciled in for the Kentucky Oaks, the
day before the Derby, but the door is opening for her to run in the
Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Both Repent and Take Charge Lady are owned by Jerry and Feye Bach
of Cincinnati. Take Charge Lady, winner of Saturday's Ashland at
Keeneland, was a late nominee--at a cost of $6,000 instead of $600 in
January--for the Triple Crown. With six wins in eight starts, she
would be a heavy favorite in the Oaks, but would be seriously
considered if she ran in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, Take Charge Lady is still in the Oaks," McPeek said.
"But I'll have to have a lengthy conversation [with the Bachs] and
see what their take on it is. She'll be favored in the Oaks, and
we've still got Harlan's Holiday for the Derby."</TE>
<TE>   The Bachs, however, do not own Harlan's Holiday. He races for Jack
Wolf. McPeek has the luxury of training Take Charge Lady for either
race, then not needing to make a decision until the week of the
Derby. He could also enter the filly in both races--entry days are
April 30 for the Oaks and May 1 for the Derby--and not make a race
decision until May 3, the day of the Oaks. The only rub with such an
either-or plan is that he would tie up a jockey for both races. Tony
D'Amico--fired off Harlan's Holiday and Repent earlier this year in
favor of Derby-experienced riders--has continued to ride Take Charge
Lady. It is not likely that McPeek would stick with D'Amico if the
filly ran in the Derby. Jerry Bailey, who rode Repent in his last two
races, might even be available to ride Take Charge Lady in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Repent was feared to have a physical problem after his erratic
stretch run in the Louisiana Derby, but McPeek said that he was
checked thoroughly after that race and the veterinarians found
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very small chip," McPeek said. "It's very minor. But in
the long-term best interests of the horse, it's best to get it out.
He should heal 100%."</TE>

<HD>Kings Make Sure of Star Power Outage</HD>
<DH>Hockey: L.A. takes care of business with 3-0 victory over
Dallas and could clinch a playoff spot tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If everything falls right for the Kings, they could clinch a playoff
spot before playing their next game Thursday night at Vancouver,
Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Taking care of the only part of the equation in their control,
they extended their winning streak to three games Monday night with a
3-0 victory over the Dallas Stars in front of a sellout crowd of
18,118 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   And if the Vancouver Canucks emerge without a point from tonight's
game against the Colorado Avalanche at Denver, the Kings are in the
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Or, if the Canucks tie or lose in overtime, the Kings can sew up a
playoff spot Wednesday night if the Edmonton Oilers lose or tie
against the Phoenix Coyotes at Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, it's back into the caldron for the Kings, who got 21
saves from Felix Potvin and goals from Adam Deadmarsh, Ziggy Palffy
and Bryan Smolinski. The empty-net goal by Smolinski ended a 30-game
goal-scoring drought as the Kings ran their home unbeaten streak to
10 games. They are 8-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2, when they
lost to the Columbus Blue Jackets.</TE>
<TE>   And after following up an 0-3-1 trip with a 3-0-1 homestand, the
Kings, in fifth place in the Western Conference, have 93 points, only
two fewer than the San Jose Sharks in the race for the Pacific
Division title after the Sharks lost Monday night to the Minnesota
Wild. Each team has three games to play, including a potential
showdown Saturday at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge homestand for us," King defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "I thought we got better as it went on."</TE>
<TE>   Against an obviously tired team that lost Sunday night to the
Ducks, 4-1, at the Arrowhead Pond, the Kings clamped down
defensively, limiting the Stars to six shots on goal in the first two
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, who did not have a shutout in the season's first three
months, matched a career high with his sixth of the season, all in
his last 36 starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings knew beforehand that with a victory they would put
themselves out of the Stars' reach in the playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   And they knew the odds were in their favor: They had won eight
consecutive games and were 10-2 at Staples Center against teams that
had played at Anaheim the night before.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out with the energy we needed to and we caught Dallas
tired," Schneider said. "The way they've battled us this year, that
wasn't the same team. There's just nights where you're going to be
like that, especially playing back-to-back games, and Anaheim's been
playing great hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "They've done us a big favor by playing as well as they have the
night before our games."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting 10th in the Western Conference after winning five
consecutive division championships, one of which they followed up by
winning the Stanley Cup in 1999, the Stars may have been down, but
they weren't out.</TE>
<TE>   They were starved for offense from the start, mustering four shots
in the first period, none in the first 81/2 minutes. In the second,
they had two shots, none in the first 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, meanwhile, took the lead with 8:08 to play in the first
period after Star defenseman John Erskine retaliated against Ian
Laperriere, who had drilled Mike Modano with a punishing check. After
the resulting scuffle, Erskine and Laperriere were given five-minute
majors for fighting, with Erskine also getting hit with instigator
and 10-minute misconduct penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-seven seconds into the power play, Deadmarsh scored his 28th
goal, recording his career-high 61st point and extending his
point-scoring streak to six games, matching the longest of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   With Deadmarsh camped in front, Jason Allison carried the puck
behind the net, drawing defenseman Derian Hatcher away from
Deadmarsh. Allison slipped a pass between Hatcher's legs and
Deadmarsh flipped the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the third period, a save by Potvin started an
odd-man rush toward the Star net, Palffy leaving a drop pass for Eric
Belanger on the right side before reversing direction and circling
around to the left.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger carried the puck toward the net before feeding a pass
through the slot to Palffy, who redirected it into the net for his
31st goal.</TE>
<TE>   Smolinski's 13th goal was his first since Jan. 17.</TE>

<HD>It's Elementary</HD>
<DH>NFL Prospect Began Career on High School Team at Age 6</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before he established himself as one of college football's best
defensive ends, Kentucky's Dennis Johnson was a high school scrub, a
human tackling dummy, a sideline standby who played only during
garbage time.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, he was only 6 at the time.</LD>
<LD>   That is no misprint. Johnson, among the top prospects in the
upcoming NFL draft, was a member of the Harrodsburg (Ky.) High
football team when he was a 5-foot-7, 170-pound second-grader. His is
a bizarre story to just about everyone but his older brother,
Derrick, who was a third-grader on that same team.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the guys on the team had to teach me how to tie my shoes,"
said Derrick, who was 5-6 and 185 pounds when he was 7, and years
later would join Dennis on Kentucky's defensive line. "We grew up on
the football field."</TE>
<TE>   The Harrodsburg team was coached by their father, Alvis, who ran
the football program for 25 years before following his sons to
Kentucky, where he is an assistant athletic director. He is a past
president of the National Federation of State High School Assns. An
official from that governing body said Dennis and Derrick are
believed to be the youngest participants of any high school varsity
sport in history.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a real hard time believing anybody out there could do it
at a younger age than they did," federation spokesman John Gillis
said.</TE>
<TE>   The two cases that come closest, Gillis said, were girls who
excelled in cross-country. One, from Alabama, won six consecutive
state titles from grades seven through 12. The other, from Kentucky,
won five consecutive titles, beginning in fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   At the time the Johnsons were playing football, Kentucky was one
of five states that allowed younger students to participate in
varsity sports even though they had yet to enroll in high school.
There was no minimum age limit when the Johnson brothers joined the
team.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of their case, however, the state adopted rules
prohibiting students from playing on a varsity team before seventh
grade. Later, that was changed to ninth grade.</TE>
<TE>   After playing one varsity season when they were in elementary
school, the Johnsons only practiced with the team until they reached
junior high. So, for Dennis, the journey from second grade to first
string took five years.</TE>
<TE>   The Johnson case was more a curiosity than a concern. They were
hulking--bigger than many of their teachers--and Harrodsburg competes
at the Class A level, for schools with the smallest enrollment. The
boys trotted onto the field only when games had been decided and
third-stringers were getting a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the first game I put Dennis in," Alvis said. "I put
him in at guard, and he was 6 or 7 at the time. His assignment was to
block the linebacker. He went out and blocked the linebacker.
Actually cut him. I'm sure none of the people knew how old [the
Johnson boys] were. You couldn't tell them from a lot of the other
kids."</TE>
<TE>   That was little consolation to the boys' mother, Rosetta Johnson,
who was wringing her hands in the stands when she first watched her
sons take the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I flinch? Yes, I did when he put them in," she said. "I said,
'God take care of them and help [Alvis] make good decisions.' But it
was fun."</TE>
<TE>   Her boys have no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back on it now, I think it was a good thing," said
Dennis, who is 6-5 and 262 pounds and widely considered one of the
top 10 available defensive ends. Draft experts say he could be
selected as high as late in the first round. "It taught me about hard
work, responsibility and, more than anything, toughness."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis, 22, USA Today's national player of the year after his
senior season at Harrodsburg, led the Southeastern Conference last
season with 12 sacks, 19 tackles for losses, and five forced fumbles.
He opted to forgo his senior season. He had a more noteworthy college
career than Derrick, 23, a 6-foot, 325-pound defensive tackle, who is
hoping to make an NFL team as a late-round draft pick or free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many people in Harrodsburg best remember the brothers as
enormous for their age, legendary eaters, polite and respectful to a
fault, and utterly devoted to following their father. They didn't
watch cartoons, they watched game films. It was common for them to
attend coaches' meetings or break down video in their spare time.</TE>
<TE>   "By sixth grade, I was going through double- and triple-practice
sessions," Dennis recalled. "I was footballing it all day as a
youngster. No time for me to go to the park and play on the swings."</TE>
<TE>   Innocence lost? That's not how the Johnsons see it. They chose to
focus on football--they never felt pressured, they say--and they were
still kids in many ways.</TE>
<TE>   "They found all the time for the normalcy of childhood," Rosetta
said. "They attended the birthday parties, they had kids over to
spend the night, they'd go to church with them--that's a priority in
our household--they'd play the board games. We didn't make them make
these choices, it was just something they enjoyed doing."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the age gap was glaring. When their teammates were
writing to colleges, the Johnson brothers were writing to Santa
Claus. When their teammates were chasing cheerleaders, they were
chasing ice-cream trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hear guys talking about girls," Dennis said. "I'd just sit
back and listen and say, 'Man, what are these guys talking about?
Girls? I don't like girls. All I want to do is play football.'"</TE>
<TE>   Chris Freeman was a Harrodsburg senior during Dennis' first
season. The two played the same positions--guard and defensive
end--and frequently would face each other in practice. Alvis Johnson
always instructed his players not to take it easy on his sons, make
them work for everything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tough for a guy that's 18 years old when you get a
second-grader lined up against you," Freeman said. "It was pretty
much like a battle trench out there. It's really tough to say, 'OK,
I'm getting ready to tear into you.' It was a lose-lose for me, no
doubt about it.</TE>
<TE>   "People would tell me: 'I can't believe you hit a second-grader.'
I'd say: 'Look, I'm not going to spend the next eight hours running
sprints.'"</TE>
<TE>   By the time Dennis was in the seventh grade, he was a starter
entrusted with making the defensive calls. He felt like a veteran,
and wound up starting six consecutive years. He had a keen ability to
anticipate.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing was I was always the last one into my stance,"
he said. "I was kind of a quarterback on defense--looking in people's
eyes, looking down the line to see if someone was in a heavy stance
or light stance. It became second nature."</TE>
<TE>   And it still is, Johnson said. Football is still a major part of
his life, but it isn't the sole focus. He now has a 4-month-old son,
Skylar, to whom he happily devotes every spare moment. Skylar doesn't
do much more than sleep and eat, which is no problem. Varsity
football can wait. How long is anyone's guess.</TE>

party, De La Hoya is sending out stronger signals than Vargas'
electronic ankle bracelet.</LD>
<TE>   He is telling us he may not be as serious about repairing his
reputation as his recent out-of-body boasting indicated.</TE>
<TE>   He is showing us that the De La Hoya cardboard cutout used
derisively by Vargas last month in his Olvera Street rally might not
be a mannequin after all.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the flat, uninterested man really was him.</TE>
<TE>   The facts have more punch than the fighter.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second consecutive De La Hoya fight that has been
stopped for a wrist injury that some feel should have been
rehabilitated by now.</TE>
<TE>   This delay, probably until September, means this will be his first
fight in more than two years against somebody with a jab and a pulse.</TE>
<TE>   This has been called a battle for the streets of Los Angeles, but
De La Hoya might need to fight it with a Thomas Guide, seeing as he
spends most of his time living in Puerto Rico with wife Millie.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means he postponed the fight last week because, as
Vargas' entourage of bullies would have you believe, he is chicken.</TE>
<TE>   But it does make you wonder about De La Hoya's possible membership
in another food group.</TE>
<TE>   Is he toast?</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's nothing more than an injury," said Shelley Finkel,
Vargas' co-manager. "But you can never be surprised about anything in
this game."</TE>
<TE>   We were all surprised at the January news conference when the
Golden Boy became the Exorcist Boy, spewing all sorts of unlikely
venom about his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Vargas. I really hate him!"</TE>
<TE>   His head spun, and then he was laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Vargas is obsessed with me. He's in love with me. He's like a
celebrity stalker."</TE>
<TE>   His head spun again, and now he was singing.</TE>
<TE>   "I-know-where-to-hit-him ... I-know-where-to-hit-him."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, while De La Hoya was running his mouth, he wasn't
exercising much of anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having left wrist and finger surgery in November--which
caused cancellation of his Olympic Auditorium fight with Roman
Karmazin--he was doing nothing to rehabilitate the wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever reason, he did nothing to make the hand stronger,"
said his promoter, Bob Arum. "That was a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   It figured, then, that at the beginning of sparring last month,
one good blow to the top of a partner's head and he could no longer
shake hands.</TE>
<TE>   "The finger was really swollen, there was no way he could even
squeeze your hand," said Dr. Tony Daly, the longtime Clipper doctor
who, during the examination, noted something else.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that his left hand was still not as strong as his right
hand," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Considering De La Hoya is left-handed, it was an amazing--if not
damning--discovery.</TE>
<TE>   He had undergone surgery, and then acted as if the appendage would
heal itself.</TE>
<TE>   As if he didn't care whether he ever threw another left hook
again.</TE>
<TE>   "He did everything the doctors said," said Richard Schaefer, De La
Hoya's business manager. "If he wanted to retire, he would have just
announced his retirement."</TE>
<TE>   Three doctors, including one from Vargas' camp, examined him, so
there should be no question of the legitimacy of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya will make $14 million on the fight, so there should
also be no question that he is willing to endure it.</TE>
<TE>   But with how much stomach?</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya refused to be interviewed by telephone from Puerto Rico
for this column, as if he now considers the Los Angeles Times an
out-of-town newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   But it is clear he wasn't ready for the brutality of this fight
any more than he was prepared for its circus.</TE>
<TE>   Remember how, during the January news conference, Top Rank
publicist Ricardo Jimenez broke his leg while trying to hold off
Vargas' entourage during the fighters' shoving match?</TE>
<TE>   Last week, after 21/2 months, Jimenez's thigh-to-ankle cast and
crutches finally disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Not that either Oscar De La Hoya or Fernando Vargas cared.</TE>
<TE>   Not once during his ordeal was Jimenez contacted by either fighter
or even a representative from either camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect anything from the Vargas camp; never expect
anything from those guys," Jimenez said. "But I expected a little
more from Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't we all.</TE>

<KH>Q&amp;A CART CEO CHRIS POOK</KH>
<HD>Trying to Steer Series Back to Prominence</HD>

<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Chris Pook, who performed one miracle in racing more than 25
years ago, perform another this year?</LD>
<LD>   Pook's announcement last December that he could turn around the
moribund Championship Auto Racing Teams, Inc., was met with as much
skepticism as his 1975 announcement that he was planning to run a
Formula One race down Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The fortunes of CART, once the premier open-wheel racing
organization in the country, changed dramatically last year.</LD>
<TE>   Roger Penske moved his high-profile team of series champion Gil de
Ferran and Indianapolis 500 winner Helio Castroneves to the
struggling Indy Racing League along with CART's major sponsor,
Marlboro; engine suppliers Honda and Ford rebelled when CART
announced it would change from turbocharged to normally aspirated
engines in 2003 and said they would not furnish engines after this
year; a race in Texas was canceled at the last moment because cars
were going too fast; the car count dropped to an all-time low and
rumors flew that several other CART teams would follow Penske into
the IRL next year.</TE>
<TE>   Pook, who turned 61 on April 1, hates to hear or read about things
like that.</TE>
<TE>   "Why have so many writers chosen to focus not on what happened at
CART in the last few months but on the shortcomings from last season,
including a race that was canceled 11 months ago?" he asked. "It
seems some of them want to keep CART on the same directionless course
it was last year. I can assure you that will not be the case.</TE>
<TE>   "In most cases they champion the greatness of the IRL and the
demise of CART, but it should be embarrassing to them when the three
opening rounds of the IRL series had attendance in the 10,000 to
15,000 range while our first three races will attract combined
three-day crowds of over half a million people."</TE>
<TE>   It was vintage Pook, stressing the positive despite stressful
surroundings, just as he had in 1977 when facing a $1.7-million debt
and Bernie Eccelstone refusing to let the Formula One cars run until
Pook came up with $300,000 for the purse. He made it, scavenging
nearly all night among Long Beach Grand Prix board members.</TE>
<TE>   Again, in 1984, he dropped F1 because of its exorbitant expenses
and turned to CART for his spring seaside race. This brought another
storm of criticism, much like this year's, when attendance fell from
82,000 in 1982 to 56,000 in 1984. By 1987, the crowds for the Indy
cars were bigger than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "You think this is tough, getting CART up and running," he said
with all the confidence of a man who enjoys the challenge of rising
from the brink. "We will turn CART around in much the same way we did
the Long Beach Grand Prix 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   In a wide-ranging interview with The Times on the eve of the
Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, which he founded and presided over
for 27 years, the new president and chief executive officer of CART
explained his positions.</TE>
<TE>   Question: After four months in your new position, where does CART
stand today?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We're running on about 71/2 cylinders at the moment, and I
expect to have it up to 8 by midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And how many cylinders were running when you took over Dec. 19?</TE>
<TE>   A: About one.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What makes you think the future is so bright?</TE>
<TE>   A: The original concept of CART is a great product. It is just the
best, with a variety of disciplines--road, oval, street and
superspeedway--that defines a true champion. There is no better
racing product.... The IRL is an oval series running in this country
only, we are a multinational series.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about criticism that CART is a junior version of Formula
One, calling itself an American series while holding nine races in
six foreign countries?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think it's terrific. To be associated with Formula One is
wonderful. F1 is in a total class of its own. There is no getting
away from the fact that ours is a North American series, but we offer
our sponsors something no other series can offer, all the benefits of
the world's newly opened trade zones. Mexico, Canada and the United
States deliver all the benefits of the NAFTA agreement, we reach the
Pacific Rim through our races in Australia and Japan, take advantage
of the European Economic Union with events in Germany and Great
Britain and hold the gateway to Latin America with our new race in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Other than adding a St. Petersburg [Fla.] street race next year,
we expect to have a stable schedule. This year we added Mexico City,
Denver, Montreal and the streets of Miami. We dropped Michigan,
Nazareth, Texas and Detroit. It all adds up to a package that is
attractive not only to sponsors, teams and drivers but millions of
race fans around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is CART's status with California Speedway, the only track
with both an IRL and a CART race?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have a contract for two more years. We've had some
attractive races there. I don't see us leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why did you wait until last December to take the job of running
CART when it was offered to you a year earlier when Bobby Rahal was
leaving as temporary CEO and Joe Heitzler was named the new
president?</TE>
<TE>   A: A year ago I didn't feel comfortable with the makeup of the
board. It had eight car owners and only three outside directors and
quite candidly, it was hard to run a company objectively under that
situation. There was too much input by the car owners, all of whom
had their own agendas. Not enough members were acting on behalf of
the shareholders. Now, the directors have a mandate from the
shareholders, led by James Grosfeld, who has a substantial block of
CART stock. He put together a strong group of independent board
members and they kind of drafted me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was the first thing you realized after taking command?</TE>
<TE>   A: No one had been running the store.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is your position in the suits and countersuits between
Heitzler and CART and CART car owners Pat Patrick and Carl Haas in
which both sides claim fraud and breach of contract?</TE>
<TE>   A: No comment. What happened happened before my time. As CEO it
will be my responsibility to administer findings of the lawsuit,
however it winds up. Other than that, I have nothing to say.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What about criticism of a weak television schedule where most
of the races will be on Speed Channel, a cable network not available
in many areas?</TE>
<TE>   A: The television audience and our 2002 programming schedule is by
no means as bleak as some of your lesser informed colleagues have
suggested. Although the IRL prefers to focus on our relationship with
Speed Channel, they fail to point out, of course, that we have seven
races on network television on Fox and CBS. (The Long Beach race will
be 12:30 p.m. Sunday on Fox.)</TE>
<TE>   In regards to Speed Channel, it is nothing less than the fastest
growing cable network on television. As we position CART for the
future, Speed Channel is the perfect partner for combined success.
When Fox as a network emerged a few years ago, nobody said they could
touch the big three networks. They did. A few years later, Fox
introduced the Fox News Channel and the popular wisdom was that
little impact would be made on CNN. Fox News Channel not only made an
impact, it has surpassed CNN in popularity. If you don't see a trend
here, you should. Look for Speed Channel's market reach to equal or
exceed ESPN's in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With Honda and Ford dropping out as engine suppliers after the
switch from turbocharged engines to normally aspirated, where is CART
going to get power for the 2003 season?</TE>
<TE>   A: We'll be OK. Cosworth has committed, although it may be with a
different name plate than Ford, much the way Ilmor switched its badge
from Mercedes to Chevrolet a few years ago. Toyota will be with us.
Honda is out, but we're working very hard to get them back. You'll
also see a couple of surprises in the near future. We could well have
four, if not five, engine manufacturers in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   There is a very fertile market out there for our teams. We reach
audiences that sell cars to those people. The IRL fans buy Ford,
Chevy and Dodge. That is their market. Our demographics show that
CART fans buy imports so we want to put on a marketable vehicle for
the fans.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Only 20 cars are running with CART, the minimum required by
promoters. Why such a small number?</TE>
<TE>   A: I would rather have 20 good drivers, in 20 good cars, than have
10 good drivers and 16 others filling the field.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you rate the chances of the IRL and CART getting
together in a single series, an idea that has gained significance
since CART adopted engine regulations similar to the IRL's?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm always open to suggestions, or ideas, but at the moment I
don't see it. We have to get our own house in order. Two years ago
some of our guys were very close to making a deal, but Tony [George]
closed the door.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why do you think George isn't interested in returning to a
single open-wheel series?</TE>
<TE>   A: Frankly, what the IRL wants is for Indy cars to go back to the
1970s when all it had was the Indy 500 and a bunch of other races not
worth a hill of beans that drew between 10,000 and 15,000 fans. That
is apparently what Tony George wants. That's the way it's looked so
far this year.</TE>

<HD>Drive Time for Holmberg as Oracle Helmsman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Holmberg breezed into Long Beach this week on top of the
sailing world, bringing along a newly earned No. 1 ranking and news
that he'll be the "primary helmsman" during Oracle Racing's America's
Cup 2003 campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to pull strings, that's for sure," said Holmberg,
41, of the U.S. Virgin Islands. "I've been a driver now for the last
year for Oracle--we've had a few of them. But now they're focusing on
me as the driver, although there has been nothing officially
announced."</LD>
<LD>   Holmberg is among several of the world's top sailors who will
compete in the 38th Congressional Cup, hosted by the Long Beach Yacht
Club, which begins today and runs through Saturday at the Long Beach
outer harbor near Belmont Pier. Racing will begin daily at noon,
weather permitting. Seven of the 10 skippers are involved in
America's Cup campaigns, including Ken Read with Team Dennis Conner
and Rod Davis and Gavin Brady with Italy's Prada.</LD>
<TE>   None, however, has been riding the wind quite like Holmberg,
winner of the last two Swedish Match Tour events and three of the
last four Congressional Cups. Holmberg attained the world's top
ranking after his most recent triumph, three weeks ago during the
Steinlager/Line 7 Cup at Auckland, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Holmberg was quick to credit his crew of five--Mike Sanderson
(mainsail), Robbie Naismith (trim), Graham Fleury (pit), Brad Webb
(bow) and John Cutler (tactician). All are from New Zealand and will
add a Kiwi flavor to a U.S. crew of 16 that, beginning in the fall,
will compete for the right to challenge defending champion Team New
Zealand for the America's Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Holmberg might not be at the helm were it not for recent events
beyond his control. Also on the Oracle team are renowned skippers
Paul Cayard and Chris Dickson. Each has been at the helm during three
America's Cups, but their domineering styles didn't sit well with
Oracle chairman and racing team owner Larry Ellison. Both, in
essence, have been kicked off the boat and relegated to other team
duties.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry wants this to be a team campaign and I think that Paul,
through no fault of his own--he's just a natural born leader--just
happened to walk a little differently than Larry wanted him to,"
Holmberg explained. "As for Chris, he's just a fiery figure and he
clashed with the team a few times--which was one time too many--so
the decision was made to take him aside as well."</TE>
<TE>   An Oracle Racing spokesman was not immediately available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the Congressional Cup's double round-robin format, 10 teams
will sail Catalina 37s, with the top four advancing to Saturday's
best-of-three semifinals, to be followed immediately by the
best-of-three championship finals.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Section has called an emergency meeting of athletic
directors for its 60 high schools today to discuss options for
resuming the sports season in the face of a prolonged school bus
drivers' strike.</LD>
<LD>   All sports events were canceled Monday and today. That's six
consecutive days of no sports activities since 700 drivers employed
by Laidlaw Education Services walked out last Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Laidlaw is the biggest transportation contractor for the Los
Angeles Unified School District. Negotiations between the drivers and
Laidlaw broke down Friday.</LD>
<TE>   It is the first such strike in the district in more than three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Fiege, commissioner for the City Section, said the
district is committed to continuing the sports season "in some
fashion" but said a schedule could resume no earlier than Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the proposals to be discussed will be the option of allowing
schools to use private transportation for games, something the
coaches have been championing for days. Those schools unable to
supply their own transportation would have the option of playing on
Saturdays with bus transportation provided by one of the other
contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played 12 tournament games and gotten there with private
transportation," Roosevelt High baseball Coach Scott Pearson said.
"We can all do it."</TE>
<TE>   Teams are allowed to use private transportation for tournaments
but not league contests. District officials have been unwilling to
waive the bus rule because of equity issues.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do for one school, we have to do for every school," Fiege
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't do that, we're being unfair."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, several City baseball teams played in tournament
games by using private transportation. And at least one school,
Roosevelt, was able to obtain a bus for its nonleague game in Costa
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   A critical West Valley League baseball game matching Chatsworth
(16-0) and Woodland Hills El Camino Real (14-2) was canceled Monday,
and district officials say they won't allow the schools to make up
the game. District officials said any games canceled from Monday on
won't be played.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely frustrating and disappointing for the coaches,
players, parents and everyone involved if these kids can't display
their talents that they've worked on for a year," Chatsworth Athletic
Director Fluke Fluker said. "Our kids are willing to go to whatever
length to play."</TE>
<TE>   The last major sports stoppage in the City Section occurred last
fall, when contests were canceled for a week after the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11. Before that, stoppages occurred in January of
1994 because of the Northridge earthquake. Games had to be
rescheduled and sites changed because of damage to schools.</TE>
<TE>   A three-week teachers' strike in 1989 forced an abbreviated spring
sports schedule.</TE>
<TE>   District officials are hopeful that those spring sports with fewer
athletes involved--baseball, tennis, softball and volleyball--can
resume with the help of private transportation. But buses almost
certainly will be required for athletes competing in track and
swimming. Golf is the only sport not affected by the bus drivers'
strike, since it relies solely on private transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the issue is that some teams and athletes are
committed to playing tournaments on Saturdays and can't reschedule
league contests for that day. The Arcadia track invitational is
Saturday, which would prevent top athletes from City track teams
competing in league meets that day.</TE>
<TE>   Varsity sports would have top priority when it comes to resuming
play. Whether the junior varsity and freshman-sophomore teams'
seasons resume is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a mess and you can see the factors tying our hands," Fiege
said.</TE>

<HD>Track Federation's Status in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Olympics: USOC considers revoking membership of U.S.
governing body for track and field.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alleging that USA Track and Field has failed its anti-doping
responsibilities, the U.S. Olympic Committee is weighing a proposal
to revoke USATF's status as this nation's ruling track and field
agency.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, USATF's membership in the USOC and its
recognition as the sport's "national governing body" would be revoked
by Aug. 31 if USATF "does not come into compliance" with anti-doping
and other issues, including accounting procedures.</LD>
<LD>   That proposal is evidence of the lingering tension that has frayed
the relationship between the two entities in recent months. Last
October, citing doping concerns, the USOC suspended funding--about $2
million to $3 million annually--to USATF.</LD>
<TE>   The friction can be traced to USATF's refusal to identify a member
of the U.S. track team at the Sydney Olympics who had tested positive
for an anabolic steroid, but was cleared on appeal just before the
2000 U.S. Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   USATF maintains that rules in effect at the time of the 1999 test
forbade it from identifying the athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal notes that USATF's "lack of compliance" has
"potentially serious international consequences for both USATF and
the USOC with the International Olympic Committee and the World
Anti-Doping Agency in their efforts to ensure drug-free sport."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution is due for a vote at the USOC's next board of
directors meeting in Boston April 20-21.</TE>
<TE>   USOC President Sandra Baldwin declined comment Monday. Craig
Masback, the chief executive officer of USATF, sought Monday to
downplay the significance of the proposal, saying that the
"temperature between the USOC and us is extremely low." But he said
the resolution was being taken "seriously," and added, "We are
speaking to the USOC about this situation, trying to find out how
we're out of compliance and how we can remedy this."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the resolution were mailed in recent days to the
123-member USOC board.</TE>
<TE>   USATF has continued to withhold the athlete's name despite
pressure from the IOC, WADA and the world track and field governing
body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation.</TE>
<TE>   In February, in connection with the Salt Lake Winter Games, IOC
President Jacques Rogge criticized the USATF for its position. Dick
Pound, an IOC member from Canada who serves as chairman of WADA,
suggested that the IAAF expel the U.S. federation if it continued to
refuse to provide the information.</TE>
<TE>   IAAF President Lamine Diack formally asked the USATF to explain
its position but has since been working behind the scenes to achieve
a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Masback stressed Monday that he and Diack have a strong working
relationship. Only days ago, the two men were in Monaco, discussing
marketing initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise of sorts was reached a few weeks ago when the USOC
resumed funding track and field after USATF officials signed what's
called a "performance partnership agreement," a contract that says,
among other things, that USATF agrees to abide by the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency's rules and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Under reforms introduced by USADA, which took over supervision of
U.S. athlete drug testing in October 2000, the names of athletes
involved in drug cases are routinely made public.</TE>

<HD>Thousands of False Burglar Alarm Calls Raise Real Concerns</HD>
<DH>Security: Response by LAPD taxes its resources, so a police
panel looks into a proposal requiring companies to provide guards to
first check what triggered calls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned by more than 100,000 false burglar alarm calls each year,
the Los Angeles Police Commission will consider a proposal today to
make alarm companies shoulder the burden.</LD>
<LD>   False alarms make up about 92% of all the burglar alarm calls that
ring into the Los Angeles Police Department yearly. Despite this,
officers must check on each of them, a chore that eats up the
manpower equivalent of about 80 officers per year.</LD>
<LD>   This impairs response times to real emergencies and annoys
officers. They nearly always arrive to find that someone has
accidentally triggered the alarm--or that the wind has jiggled a
window pane.</LD>
<TE>   "It's crazy what we're doing," said Sgt. Loren Farell of the
LAPD's Devonshire Division. "You know what it's like up here in the
Valley with the Santa Anas--when it's blowing like crazy, we spend
half our day doing code 30s [alarm responses]."</TE>
<TE>   The false alarm burden on police agencies is a national problem,
and a number of cities have begun seeking solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has tried a smorgasbord of regulatory solutions in
recent years--stiffer penalties for repeat false-alarm offenders, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts are credited with shrinking the false alarm ratio to
about 92% of the total, from 98% previously, but a considerable
problem remains, said Police Commission Lt. Debra Kirk.</TE>
<TE>   So commission staff are scheduled to recommend a more radical
solution: requiring alarm companies to contract with their own armed
response companies. Private security guards would then respond to
burglar alarms to verify whether the call is legitimate. Only in the
case of a real emergency would they notify police. The police would
continue to respond to robbery, duress and panic button calls.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal replicates one in Salt Lake City, where false alarm
calls to police plummeted by about 90% practically overnight after a
new ordinance went into effect, according to Shanna Werner, alarms
administrator for the Salt Lake City police.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Szell, western regional vice president for Protection One, the
nation's second-largest alarm company, said his firm would oppose
such a change in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many customers in Los Angeles and there are very
limited guard response companies, and we don't want to degrade the
service," Szell said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the suggestion that a new city ordinance might require a
host of armed response contracts with alarm companies caught the
interest of Paul Nelson, chief executive of Quality Security in Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said his security business in the Utah capital has grown by
about 10% since the city required alarm companies to provide their
own response. Hearing that Los Angeles might consider a similar
ordinance, Nelson, a former Angeleno, said he would consider moving
back.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission today will be asked to request that the city
attorney explore amendments to the city's alarm code to make the
change, and direct the Police Department to draft a policy change.
The commission would then revisit the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk noted that some studies have shown that most burglary victims
are low-income householders, while alarm systems tend to be more
common in higher-income homes. Given that, she asked, "wouldn't we be
better off using 80 officers to respond to crimes in progress ... for
all the citizens of Los Angeles, not just those with burglar alarms?"</TE>

<HD>Bilingual Charter School Hopes to Be a Model, in Any
Language</HD>
<DH>Education: The students are expected to speak Spanish and
English fluently by the fifth grade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing only about a yard high himself, Anthony Gutierrez mustered
all his strength to extend a wooden yardstick over his head.</LD>
<LD>   With his back to his fellow kindergartners, Anthony perched on his
tiptoes and pointed at the alphabet spelled out above him.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of the A for apple or Z for zebra, in this alphabet, A
stood for el arbol (tree) and Z for los zapatos (shoes).</LD>
<TE>   This was a typical morning lesson at the Multicultural Learning
Center, a dual-language charter elementary school in Canoga Park with
a simple mission: Every student, regardless of native language, will
speak both English and Spanish fluently by the fifth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 791 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
Multicultural Learning Center is the first that offers a
dual-language curriculum. A second, in Boyle Heights, is in the
planning stages. The center also is one of only 15 dual-language
public charter schools in the state, according to the California
Network of Educational Charters, a charter school advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish-immersion method might seem controversial in a state
where voters in 1998 chose essentially to eliminate bilingual
education in public schools. But, as a charter school, the
Multicultural Learning Center receives federal, state and local funds
and is free to hire its own faculty and establish its own curriculum.
It does not have to adhere to the same policies other district
schools must follow. The state Department of Education Charter
Schools Unit oversees California charter schools.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say they are convinced the approach will work. Within a
few years, the center hopes to be a strong example of good
dual-language instruction--and good schooling overall, says a
district official.</TE>
<TE>   "We have hopes that they will eventually become a model for those
schools interested in dual-language instruction," said Grace Arnold,
who supervises 39 charter schools in the Los Angeles district.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Tobey Bornstein came up with the idea for the
Multicultural Learning Center. Bornstein, who had spent more than 35
years as an educator, said the concept sprang out of a deep-seated
faith in both charter schools and bilingualism.</TE>
<TE>   Research, including some funded by the U.S. Department of
Education, has shown "that children whose first language is Spanish
do much better in English when they develop language abilities in
Spanish first," said Bornstein, the center's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   And while it's true that native English speakers might fall a
little behind in English literacy at first, she said, by the fifth
grade they will have more than caught up--and will be fluent in a
second language.</TE>
<TE>   These arguments won over L.A. Unified in April 2001, when the
district granted a small group of San Fernando Valley educators,
business people and community leaders a charter for the school.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the school opened with 194 students in kindergarten
through fourth grade in space rented at the Faith Lutheran Church on
De Soto Avenue. There, 11 bilingual teachers lead classes with 20 to
25 students each. Fifth grade will be added in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Now in their second semester, the students seem to be catching on.</TE>
<TE>   Five-year-old Paige Nelson, whose family speaks English at home,
finds reading in Spanish easier, said her mother, Sheri Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   "For a kindergartner to read at all is amazing," Nelson said. "And
my daughter is reading in Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   In kindergarten and first grade at the school, students are
immersed in Spanish-only instruction about 90% of the day.</TE>
<TE>   By fifth grade, students will spend half their day learning in
Spanish and half in English.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, California voters effectively eliminated bilingual
education when they approved Proposition 227. Generally, the law
requires all California students be taught in English.</TE>
<TE>   Bilingual programs would be made available only if parents apply
for waivers at their children's schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some supporters of the proposition say the center seems to be
skirting the law.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-fought battles leading up to Prop. 227 and the ensuing
courtroom battles have all resulted in a commitment to English
immersion," said David Gersten, executive director of the Center for
Equal Opportunity, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank
that works to eliminate race considerations from employment and
schooling.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein said the center makes practical sense, especially in her
Canoga Park neighborhood where 44% of residents are Latino, according
to census figures.</TE>

<CX>   Bilingual charter school--A story and caption in Tuesday's
California section about the Multicultural Learning Center in Canoga Park
may have implied incorrectly that it is the first in the Los Angeles
Unified School District to offer a dual-language curriculum. It's the
first charter school to do so. A second dual-language charter school is
planned in Boyle Heights.</CX>

<HD>Suspect in Kidnap Ring Cooperating</HD>
<DH>Courts: Documents show Sherman Oaks man has immunity deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sherman Oaks man charged in the kidnapping of one of five people
found dead in the gold country led authorities to the lake where the
bodies were dumped and is cooperating with prosecutors, according to
court documents obtained Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Ainar Altmanis, 42, wanted to "tell the FBI
everything" after his arrest in February and later worked out a "use
immunity" agreement with federal prosecutors, his attorney, Ellen M.
Barry, says in the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, such agreements prevent anything informants say from
being used against them.</LD>
<TE>   Altmanis is one of six people charged in what federal authorities
describe as a kidnap-for-ransom ring operating in Southern
California. All the suspects have roots in Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The documents filed by Barry on March 21 were an application to
seal an affidavit supporting the government's complaint against
Altmanis. U.S. District Judge Christine Snyder sealed the affidavit,
but the application remained in a public court file.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Barry nor a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office would
confirm that Altmanis has been helping the FBI and prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The documents say Altmanis has informed authorities that the
"kidnappings charged in this indictment [against Altmanis], as well
as other uncharged kidnappings, resulted in the deaths of the
victims."</TE>
<TE>   No murder charges have been filed. The U.S. attorney's office says
it might bring more charges, however.</TE>
<TE>   The documents also say Altmanis provided details about "other
uncharged conduct relating to these crimes."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of these disclosures, Barry says in the documents,
Altmanis fears he will be killed by friends of the co-defendants, as
well as those of at least one victim. She did not identify the
victim.</TE>
<TE>   A federal indictment charges Altmanis and Petro Krylov, 29, of
West Hollywood with aiding and abetting in the kidnapping of
Alexander Umansky, 35, of North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Encino residents Iouri Mikhel, 36, and Jurijus Kadamovas, 35, are
charged with directly participating in the abductions of Umansky and
businessman George Safiev, 37, of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate indictment, two Russian nationals living in the
United Arab Emirates, Andrei Agueev and Andrei Liapine, are charged
with receiving about $235,000 wired to them as ransom for Umansky.
Both were arrested in Dubai and transported by the FBI to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   All of the suspects have pleaded not guilty and are being held
without bail. A seventh suspect is still being sought.</TE>
<TE>   The weighted bodies of Umansky and Safiev were pulled last month
from the New Melones Lake in Calaveras County, along with the bodies
of Safiev's business associates, Rita Pekler and Nick Kharabadze.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Sherman Oaks developer Meyer Muscatel was pulled from
the lake in October.</TE>

<LD>More than three dozen Central American children who were being
smuggled to Los Angeles are back in their homeland after being
detained in Guatemala, a Salvadoran official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Guatemalan authorities last week intercepted the group of 38
Salvadoran minors, including a 2 1/2-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   All were destined to be reunited with relatives in the United
States, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The children were detained in Guatemala on Friday as part of a
multinational investigation.</TE>
<TE>   They may be the largest group of trafficked children ever
discovered together in the often-hazardous smuggling corridor from
Central America to the United States, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The children were initially being brought to Los Angeles, but
their families probably reside throughout the United States,
according to authorities.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sherman Oaks man charged in the kidnapping of one of five people
found dead in the gold country led authorities to the lake where the
bodies were dumped and is cooperating with prosecutors, according to
court documents obtained Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, 42-year-old Ainar Altmanis, wanted to "tell the FBI
everything" after his arrest in February, and later worked out a "use
immunity" agreement with federal prosecutors, his attorney, Ellen M.
Barry, says in the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, such agreements prevent anything informants say from
being used against them.</LD>
<TE>   Altmanis is one of six people charged in what authorities describe
as a kidnap-for-ransom ring. The suspects, most from the San Fernando
Valley, have roots in Eastern Europe, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Striking Bus Drivers Veto Binding Arbitration Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bus drivers striking against the Los Angeles Unified School
District's biggest transportation contractor turned down a proposal
Monday from a federal mediator to end their weeklong walkout and
enter into binding arbitration.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with Teamsters Union Local 572 said their membership
voted against resuming talks with Laidlaw Education Services. The
union now is attempting to draw L.A. Unified directly into the
dispute, which has delayed 700 bus routes and affected 20,000
schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   Students waited an average of 50 minutes each way Monday for trips
on Laidlaw routes serviced by substitute drivers.</LD>
<TE>   No further talks are scheduled between the two parties.</TE>
<TE>   Don Owens, a Teamsters spokesman, said, "The school board needs to
come into this."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Schools Supt. Roy Romer has refused to get involved,
saying that the disagreement is a contractual issue between the union
and Laidlaw. "They ought to use the mediator they have, and they
ought to settle," Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Teamsters said L.A. Unified is indirectly involved because
it did not require Laidlaw to offer wages and benefits comparable to
those paid by the district to its 1,100 in-house drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Also applying pressure on the district are state Sen. Gloria
Romero and Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, Los Angeles Democrats. They
attended a rally at Local 572's Carson headquarters Sunday and urged
Romer to institute a "living wage" requirement for district
contractors.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Julie Korenstein also plans to introduce a
measure at today's Board of Education meeting, stating the right of
bus drivers to a living wage.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he believes Laidlaw is paying its workers a living
wage. He said it would be impractical to require living wage packages
for the district's many contractors, but said it should be addressed
on a "case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw pays its school bus drivers $8 to $15 an hour, while the
district pays its own in-house drivers $13 to $24 an hour and offers
superior benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw Vice President Jim Ferraro said Monday that the bus
company's last offer was for wage increases averaging 4.6% each year
for three years and better health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   But the Teamsters said the offer proposed better raises for
drivers with six to 10 years of experience and less to new and more
experienced drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "Our contention from the beginning [was that] we want every member
to get an equal raise," Owens said.</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Hiring Quotas Ended</HD>
<DH>Courts: Goals of 1974 consent decree have been
accomplished, federal judge says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday ended a 1974 consent decree requiring that
half of all Los Angeles firefighters be hired from the ranks of
blacks, Latinos and Asians to alleviate racial disparities.</LD>
<LD>   "Twenty eight years of water has now passed over the dam. All of
the goals of the original consent decree have been accomplished,"
U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling represents a historic moment for the 3,334-member
department, once considered a bastion of resistance to racial
integration.</LD>
<TE>   When the city originally signed the decree to settle a Justice
Department complaint, nonwhites made up a mere 5% of the firefighter
force. Today, Latinos, African Americans and Asian Americans account
for 50.2% of Los Angeles' firefighters, according to city figures.
"No racial group now has a majority in the Fire Department," Hupp
noted.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's civil rights division and the Los Angeles
city attorney's office, parties to the 1974 agreement, filed briefs
in March asking the judge to scrap the racial hiring quotas.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the decree, the city had promised to hire at least
50% nonwhites annually until minority representation matched the
racial composition of the city's civilian labor force.</TE>
<TE>   In its brief, the Justice Department said the city had complied
with the decree in good faith, resulting in significant improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The department cited figures showing that Latino representation
among firefighters climbed from 3.1% in 1975 to 31% at the end of
2001, while the percentage of blacks rose from 1.9% to 13.2% and
Asian ranks swelled from .06% to 6% during that period.</TE>
<TE>   "The consent decree has outlasted its purpose and is now
obsolete," wrote Hupp.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the city argued that the consent decree now works
against racial minorities.</TE>
<TE>   As written, the decree requires that half of those allowed to take
the firefighters' exam must be Caucasian, the city attorney's office
said in its brief. Nevertheless, whites constitute less than 30% of
the city's population, according to the 2000 census, down from about
75% in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   If the city were to continue under the 50% Caucasian and 50%
minority standard, there would never be parity with the general work
force and the consent decree would be "waiting to greet those
Angeleno descendants born in the next millennium," wrote Deputy City
Atty. Vivienne Swanigan.</TE>
<TE>   Hupp's ruling was an outgrowth of lawsuits filed by four white
applicants who challenged the constitutionality of the 1974 consent
decree.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyers argued that the consent decree had been transformed
from a "tool to eliminate vestiges of prior discrimination into an
institutionalized form of hiring based primarily on race."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that race-based
programs must be "narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling
government interest," wrote Manuel Klausner and Patrick Manshardt of
the Individual Rights Foundation, a conservative-libertarian legal
group that represented the white plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The consent decree, they said, no longer serves its intended
purpose and, therefore, violates the firefighters' 5th Amendment
rights to due process and 14th Amendment rights to equal protection.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of that legal challenge, the Justice Department and
the city attorney's office reviewed the consent decree late last year
and concluded that its goals had been met.</TE>
<TE>   Hupp did not rule on the constitutional challenge raised by the
white applicants, but Manshardt said after Monday's ruling that he
was pleased.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Justice Department called for eliminating the
decree's racial hiring quotas, it asked Hupp to retain jurisdiction
over the case while it reviews the fairness of the entrance exam now
given to firefighter applicants.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said the exam has a "disparate impact
against" blacks and Latinos, although it is not clear whether any
civil rights laws have been broken.</TE>
<TE>   Hupp told the department to file a new lawsuit if it cannot
resolve the problem informally with the city.</TE>
<TE>   At Fire Department headquarters, a spokesman hailed the judge's
order. "It's a testament to the recruitment efforts that we've put
forward all these years," said Battalion Chief Robert Franco, the
department's community liaison officer.</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing that the department has made great strides in
minority hiring, the president of an organization of black
firefighters expressed some concern about ending the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   Fire inspector Bill Parker, head of the Stentorians, said the
department has improved under Chief William R. Bammatre, "but I'm
worried about what might happen after him, two or three chiefs down
the line. Will there be any backsliding without a consent decree?"</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department was not always hospitable to
African Americans and other racial minorities. Although blacks were
first hired in 1897, they were segregated from white firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   There were only two stations where they could work. Promotions
occurred only when there was a death or retirement at one of those
stations.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1950s, the Fire Commission ordered an end to
segregation, but several more years elapsed before the directive was
fully implemented. And it took more than a quarter of a century under
a federal court decree for minorities to achieve parity in hiring
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Female firefighters sued the department in 1994, alleging
discrimination and harassment. But Bammatre has said he is determined
to hire more women and ensure that they are treated fairly.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cypress Redevelopment Agency voted unanimously Monday to accept a
proposal that would put a Costco store on a parcel near the Los
Alamitos Race Track instead of the large church favored by the land's
owners.</LD>
<LD>   "This was part of the process," City Councilman and agency member
Tim Keenan said after the vote. "Our hands were tied."</LD>
<LD>   But the Rev. Mike Wilson, a pastor at Cottonwood Christian Center,
had a different reaction.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel it's been unfair," he said in anticipation of Monday's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been negotiating with them for months and we don't feel
they're being honorable."</TE>
<TE>   About 200 Cottonwood members attended the Monday night meeting,
many of them speaking forcefully in favor of the church.</TE>
<TE>   The church bought the 18-acre property at Walker Street and
Katella Avenue in 1999 in hopes of moving from its current 2.4-acre
site in Los Alamitos.</TE>

<HD>School Board Assigned to Review Homework Policy</HD>
<DH>Education: Conejo Valley trustees will consider parents'
complaints that students are overworked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School officials in one of Ventura County's highest-performing
districts are considering changing guidelines to limit the amount of
homework students get each night.</LD>
<LD>   The move in the Conejo Valley Unified School District renews a
decades-old debate about the work students must complete each
evening: How much is too much?</LD>
<LD>   Recent parent complaints prompted Conejo Valley officials to begin
studying the issue and working to update their 16-year-old policy,
said Richard Simpson, assistant superintendent in charge of
instruction.</LD>
<TE>   Since November, a committee of district officials, teachers and
parents have done their own homework, studying the latest research
and engaging in sometimes-spirited debates, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting proposal, which school board members will review
tonight, provides guidelines for teachers by grade level in three
aspects of homework: quantity, type, and importance in grading.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would reduce homework for elementary school students,
Simpson said. Assignments would be limited to 20 minutes for first-
and second-graders and 50 minutes for third-, fourth- and
fifth-graders. Nightly homework assignments for most middle school
students would be limited to about 90 minutes. Research shows that
spending more than an hour and a half per day on homework in middle
school could reduce student achievement, Simpson said.</TE>
<TE>   In high school, homework would range from 90 to 120 minutes a
night.</TE>
<TE>   For all students, only homework assignments directly linked to
state academic standards would count toward a grade.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks High School sophomore Dani Anderson said the changes
won't affect her much this year, as she typically has about two hours
of homework each night.</TE>
<TE>   But she thinks the district is headed in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "When we do have a lot of homework, it's way too much," she said.
"We go to six classes a day, and it's almost like teachers forget you
have other classes."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Amanda Jeka, who plays on the school's softball team,
said she often has three to four hours of homework after practice.
She agreed that more coordination among teachers would help.</TE>
<TE>   "I know people who have to stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning to
do homework, which is ridiculous," she said. "We're only high school
students."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, teachers expressed a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we are giving too much," said Susan Falk, president
of the Unified Assn. of Conejo Teachers. "There may be nights when
there's more to meet a standard, but it all seems to balance out in
the end."</TE>
<TE>   Falk said she approves of the district's proposal, for the most
part, but predicted that the time restrictions will be difficult for
educators, particularly those in middle and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   She and other teachers say that homework assignments are already
geared to California's academic standards, so there's no need for a
mandate.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are professionals," said Westlake High School English
teacher Meribeth Freeman. "They know their job and what they're
supposed to do. We're very precise in our homework assignments and
have long known the old concept of homework for the sake of homework
didn't apply."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson said he believes that the process of crafting the
policy--namely bringing parents and teachers together to discuss the
issues--was one of its biggest benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly a lot of teachers are already right on target," he said.
"But this is going to help ensure that with all the things in kids'
lives, homework is there for a good purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The Conejo Valley school board meets at 7 tonight at district
headquarters, 1400 E. Janss Road in Thousand Oaks.</TE>

<HD>With Money and Marches, Jews Show Support for Israel</HD>
<DH>Southland: The congregants raise millions. Some criticize
Israeli policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In their biggest mobilization for Israel in a decade, Southern
California Jews are raising millions of dollars, holding rallies and
rushing to the region to show support as escalating Mideast violence
stirs anguish, anger and a zeal to help.</LD>
<LD>   While the unrelenting bloodshed has provoked some American Jews
into questioning Israeli policies against Palestinians, the crisis
has united many others in solid and astonishingly generous support of
the Jewish state.</LD>
<LD>   On one recent morning during Passover, for instance, Sinai Temple
in Los Angeles alone raised $1.4 million in humanitarian aid. On
Monday, more than a dozen Los Angeles Jewish leaders departed for
Israel with pledges for millions more.</LD>
<TE>   John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los
Angeles, will deliver $1 million in humanitarian aid this week as the
first installment of a $10-million fund-raising campaign for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The money is part of American Jewry's national campaign to raise
more than $200 million for the Jewish state, which requested the
emergency aid after more than 18 months of violence with Palestinians
has ravaged its economy, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Fishel said the money will be used for such services as support
for Israeli hospitals, emergency medical supplies, grief counseling
and care for orphans of violence. Some of the money will be targeted
to improve emergency response systems in Tel Aviv, an informal sister
city of Los Angeles, Fishel said.</TE>
<TE>   "People here feel anguish and a lot of deep, deep concern that
something about this crisis is clearly different," Fishel said. "Many
of us believe that what we're looking at is the survival of the
Jewish state."</TE>
<TE>   A group of 13 prominent Southern California rabbis, drawn from
Judaism's four major movements, headed for Israel on Monday with
$15,000 in cash and gifts after a stop in Germany to commemorate
Holocaust Remembrance Day. The trip is organized by the Board of
Rabbis of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Among the participants is Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark of Temple Beth
Ohr in La Mirada, who is bringing solar-powered calculators, jazz
compact discs and more than $5,000 in cash. Goldmark, a former
rabbinical board president, said his politics are more liberal than
the present Israeli government's but that the present crisis was no
time to be critical.</TE>
<TE>   "My overall feelings are for the people of Israel--both the Jews
and Arabs," he said. "When you're at war, and I believe Israel is at
war, you just have to have unity."</TE>
<TE>   Some Jews, however, have mobilized on the issue in a different
way: as what they call "loving critics" of Israel. Last week, a group
calling itself "Women in Black," whose members are mostly Israelis
and American Jews, demonstrated in front of the Israeli consulate on
Wilshire Boulevard. More than 100 participants bore signs urging the
Israeli government to "Free Palestine" and "End the Israeli
Occupation."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Jacobus, a Reform Jew who co-founded the Los Angeles branch
of the international women's group in 1989, said her opposition to
the occupation stems from her love of Israel and her Jewish values of
social justice.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobus, a Los Angeles writer, said images of Israeli tanks
rolling into Palestinian cities and Palestinian women compelled to
give birth on sidewalks because they were not allowed to pass
checkpoints had touched her heart. They caused her to question
messages she grew up with to "support Israel, right or wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "Loving, constructive criticism of Israel is not only permissible
but absolutely essential," Jacobus said. "It is not our vision to see
Israel as an occupying power and a militarized society."</TE>
<TE>   Jewish officials say such sentiments are in the minority as most
American Jews primarily blame Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat for the prolonged violence and rush to support the Jewish
homeland. On Sunday, more than 2,000 people turned out to support
Israel in a Westwood rally sponsored by the Jewish Federation,
various synagogues and other major Jewish organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some synagogues have begun to mobilize. Stephen Wise
Temple in Los Angeles, whose 3,500 families make it the largest
Reform congregation in the nation, is asking congregants to
participate in four projects this month to support Israel. They are:
a "solidarity seder" April 17 to commemorate the 26 Jews killed and
more than 100 wounded by a Palestinian suicide bombing on Passover
last month; a rally and family gathering April 21 at Woodley Park in
Encino; an educational campaign to learn more about the crisis; and
monetary contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "The best response to feelings of despair and helplessness is to
do something," said Rabbi Eli Herscher of Stephen Wise.</TE>
<TE>   At Sinai Temple, Rabbi David Wolpe said the congregation expects
to raise at least $2 million for humanitarian aid. He said the
overwhelming response to his appeal on the first day of Passover
stemmed in part from the particularly close bonds his mostly Persian
Jewish congregants feel for Israel. He said pledges have ranged from
$5 from schoolchildren to $25,000 each from six individuals. The
Magbit educational foundation, which funds scholarships in Israel,
has announced it will match donations up to $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Jewish mobilization, American Muslims say they
have been crippled in their attempts to raise humanitarian aid for
Palestinians after federal authorities shut down two of the nation's
largest Islamic relief organizations in December on charges that they
supported terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Since federal authorities shut down the Holy Land Foundation and
Global Relief four months ago, American Muslims have started two new
relief organizations aimed at helping Palestinian children: Kinder
USA, which focuses on youth in the occupied territories of the West
Bank and Gaza; and Kind Hearts, which helps Palestinian children in
refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some individual mosques have held fund-raisers,
usually netting in the $10,000 range, said Hussam Ayloush of the
Anaheim office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the will to help is there, and the resources are
there," Ayloush said.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is an atmosphere of apprehension among Muslims since
various measures were taken by the government against legitimate
Islamic relief organizations. It has led many Muslims to be doubtful
about whether to give or not."</TE>

<HD>Driver's License Plan for Illegal Workers Criticized</HD>
<DH>Politics: Minority-rights activists say identifying mark on
special licenses would be a 'scarlet letter.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis works to keep Latino voters and law enforcement
officers as core constituents in his reelection campaign,
minority-rights activists are attacking a suggestion that if
undocumented immigrants are allowed to drive in California, they
should be identified on their driver's licenses as illegal workers.</LD>
<LD>   The idea, supported by Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and
other top-level peace officers, would imprint a letter such as "I"
for immigrant or a coded number on a license so police could
determine immediately if they were dealing with someone in the
country illegally.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that is a very helpful tool," said Baca, one of the
governor's most influential advisors.</LD>
<TE>   Baca is head of a task force helping Davis craft a compromise bill
that would allow certain unlawful immigrants to drive in the state
but at the same time protect the safety of citizens against
terrorists and other criminals.</TE>
<TE>   But the notion of a special identifier on the license, which Davis
aides said could be printed in an inoffensive way, is drawing strong
criticism from civil libertarians and immigrant-rights advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's essentially giving these folks a scarlet letter," said Rini
Chakraborty, a negotiator for the California Immigrant Welfare
Collaborative. "It's an open invitation to all sorts of
discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   Baca and other participants in a series of behind-the-scenes
meetings said last week that it was still unresolved whether the
proposed license would include a special color, letter or number.
Davis hopes to find a solution to this and other immigrant driver's
license issues this summer so the Legislature can act on it.</TE>
<TE>   But Baca rejected the assertion that a license identifying the
driver as an illegal immigrant would violate the person's rights,
especially because he or she was illegally in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a driver's license that has a letter identifier on it [be]
somehow a denial of legal rights is incomprehensible to me," the
sheriff said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't understand it, I doubt the average Californian will
understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Baca said that, especially since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
"California has to be very cautious before it goes leaping into this
area."</TE>
<TE>   In the Latino community, the most contentious issue by far is
enactment of a law that would enable unlawful immigrants to drive in
California. Last year, Mexican President Vicente Fox called on Davis
to support such legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who counts the Latino population as a political cornerstone
of his bid for a second term, favors providing driver's licenses to
illegal immigrants with certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, they must have a clean criminal record, be
applying for citizenship, provide a federal taxpayer identification
number (in lieu of a Social Security number), and have resided in
California for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), author of the legislation
creating the special license program, said about 2 million illegal
immigrants would be eligible for such permits.</TE>
<TE>   His bill is supported by various police chiefs and automobile
insurance companies that believe trained and licensed drivers would
make the highways safer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis two years ago vetoed a similar proposal. The Legislature
sent another bill to Davis last year, but the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon destroyed any chance that the
governor would sign it. He and others noted that some of the
foreign-born terrorists had phony U.S. driver's licenses.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, Davis appointed Baca and several other sheriffs
and police chiefs to advise him on safety issues, including licensing
undocumented workers to drive in California.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the key issue in the Latino community at this time. It is
so important," said Sarah Mercer of the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Potentially Dangerous' Discrimination Feared</TE>
<TE>   She said that immigrant-rights advocates understand the fears of
law enforcement officials, but that a special license for illegal
workers would be "potentially dangerous" because it might encourage
discrimination against them.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand their concerns, but at the same time we have to
[create a license program] that is nondiscriminatory," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mercer and Chakraborty noted that minority Californians vividly
recall discrimination following the 1994 passage of Proposition 187,
the anti-illegal-immigrant initiative championed by then-Gov. Pete
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   An identifier on the driver's license would be an "open invitation
for employers, cops and vigilantes to discriminate," Chakraborty
said. She said no immigrant-rights organizations would support "such
an extreme measure."</TE>
<TE>   But Russ Lopez, a spokesman for Davis, denied that a special
identifier would act as a "scarlet letter" and invite discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very subtle and very inoffensive. We're not talking
about a big green stripe on the license or a huge stamp that says,
'Immigrant,'" he said. "We're talking about one number or letter."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who noted that he is of Latino ancestry, said a license
identifying the driver as an unlawful immigrant would be appropriate.
"The truth of the matter is that these undocumented workers are
different." Baca said he thinks California should recognize that many
illegal immigrants drive now without having passed a driver's test or
buying auto insurance.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he favors a more comprehensive reform program that
would deal with a host of related issues on a slower but more
effective basis.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in time, we will allow illegal immigrants to have a
driver's license as long as they are trustworthy and noncriminal
people," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time," he added, "let's deal with [problems of
illegal immigrant] crime, jailing and deportation problems all at the
same time."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has said repeatedly in the last few weeks that qualified
illegal immigrants should be allowed to "drive to work," but he has
not said if the driving privilege should be extended beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said it would be virtually impossible to enforce a law that
permitted driving for employment purposes only.</TE>
<TE>   Driving for work reasons may be problematic, however, because it
is against the law for an employer to knowingly hire an undocumented
worker.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County officials averted a legal showdown Monday by agreeing
to provide psychiatric treatment for a teenager who had previously
been denied help.</LD>
<LD>   The youth, sentenced to a Camarillo work program, will receive
counseling under an agreement reached by Probation Agency chief Cal
Remington and Behavioral Health Director David Gudeman.</LD>
<LD>   Remington and Gudeman presented the written contract to Superior
Court Judge John Dobroth during a closed-door meeting in the judge's
chambers.</LD>
<TE>   Dobroth had threatened to order the county to treat the teenager
after county lawyers argued that the Behavioral Health Department was
not contractually obligated to do so. Dobroth on Monday agreed to
allow two weeks for the county to follow through on providing
treatment for the minor and other juvenile offenders.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston, who also attended the
closed session, said he assured Dobroth that the county's Behavioral
Health Department will be restructured to avoid another delay in
services.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be going to the Board of Supervisors on [April 16] with
recommendations," Johnston said outside the courtroom. "Hopefully, we
can settle some long-standing disagreements and get this resolved."</TE>
<TE>   In brief comments when he returned to the bench, Dobroth said he
was willing to wait a little longer to see what improvements the
county will make. But the judge was skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "That may be possible," he said. "But government is a little slow
at times."</TE>
<TE>   The youth, a minor who had been sentenced by Dobroth to a work
program at Camarillo Airport, will be seen by UCLA psychiatry
professor Murray Brown, Gudeman said outside court.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement with Remington, other juvenile offenders who
need treatment will be driven from Camarillo to Ventura, where the
county psychiatrists are, Gudeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Top county officials said that Monday's hearing was the first
hurdle in resolving disagreements between the behavioral health and
probation departments. Remington said he has had trouble getting
mental health services for the youths his officers supervise.</TE>
<TE>   The problem began about two years ago, after Gudeman was appointed
as head of the Behavioral Health Department, Remington said. Gudeman
said he is doing the best he can with a tight budget.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston has said he will recommend that Behavioral Health be
removed from the larger Health Care Agency. It would give Johnston
greater control over Behavioral Health's budget and make him
Gudeman's direct supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman's current boss, Health Care Agency Director Pierre Durand,
did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman said he first learned about the planned move from news
accounts. He is not against the proposal, he said, but is concerned
it be done properly.</TE>
<TE>   A previous attempt to merge the mental health division with the
social services agency indirectly resulted in a federal Medicare
billing investigation, Gudeman noted. The county was ordered to pay
$15.3 million in penalties.</TE>
<TE>   A well-studied approach that includes consultation with county
psychiatrists and the Mental Health Advisory Board should be taken
before any action is approved, said Gudeman, a UCLA-trained
psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   Remington said he is prepared to do what's necessary to get
services to youths on probation.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we need to work together," Remington said. "If
we have to go to court every time Behavioral Health has a problem
with the fine print in a contract, it's not going to work."</TE>

<LD>Developers of a 572-home hillside subdivision blocked by Glendale
have filed a lawsuit alleging that the city, in effect, took their
property without compensation and violated their constitutional
rights.</LD>
<LD>   The litigation came a month after the Glendale City Council
unanimously rejected plans for Oakmont View V, a 238-acre luxury
tract in the Verdugo Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists and homeowner groups have fought the project for
more than a decade.</LD>
<TE>   "We are absolutely not giving up, that's for darn sure," said John
L. Gregg, president of Gregg's Artistic Homes, the builder. "Not
after all we've invested in the property."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
alleges that the council's action amounted to a condemnation of the
property, without compensation to Gregg's company. The amount of
damages sought will depend on a professional assessment, but will be
"in the tens of millions," said Scott Yamaguchi, Gregg's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, the developers say, the land was appraised at $46
million.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Mayor Rafi Manoukian declined to comment Monday. City
Atty. Scott Howard said the suit was expected and "the city intends
to vigorously defend against it.''</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have approved $8 million toward buying the Oakmont
land for preservation. But Yamaguchi said that amount is not "even
close to its worth."</TE>
<TE>   It is the third lawsuit filed by Gregg's Artistic Homes against
the city. The other two disputed the city's handling of the
environmental impact report for Oakmont.</TE>
<TE>   Council members have said they opposed Oakmont mostly because of
health and environmental hazards. City planners had released a
24-page report that found the project "inconsistent" with the
Glendale General Plan. The report also said the tract could pose a
landslide hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,000-page environmental impact report concluded that Oakmont
would harm the air, wildlife and scenic vistas.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg disputed the findings in both reports.</TE>

<LD>Police are seeking witnesses to an attempted homicide that occurred
about 11:20 p.m. Saturday on the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway near
the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say a blue or other dark-colored Ford Expedition or
Chevy Blazer pulled alongside a 1997 white Nissan Pathfinder and
fired into the driver's side with a handgun. The driver was struck
and began to lose consciousness, but the passenger helped control the
Pathfinder and stopped it on the Costa Mesa Freeway near Bay Street,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver remains hospitalized in serious condition. The
passenger was not injured. Both had been to a party in Santa Ana
before the shooting and police believe the incident could be
gang-related.</LD>

Detective Bob Fate, (714) 754-5313.</TE>

<LD>In a move that could signal trouble for the Orange County Sanitation
District, the California Coastal Commission voted 6 to 1 Monday to
oppose a waiver that allows San Diego to dump dirtier sewage into the
ocean than nearly all of the nation's 16,000 sanitation agencies.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County district, based in Fountain Valley, has a
similar waiver that expires in 2003, and its board will decide this
year whether to seek renewal from state and federal water officials.</LD>
<LD>   Local environmentalists celebrated the commission's vote, which
came after a two-hour public hearing in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   "This is great news and good ammo for us," wrote Jan Vandersloot,
a local waiver opponent, in e-mails sent to environmentalists and

<LD>A high school girl phoned the advisement center at Cal State L.A. to

<TE>   QuackAlert: Marilyn Cagle thinks there's hope for L.A. drivers
yet; several of them good-naturedly allowed their commutes to be
interrupted by a mother duck and about a dozen ducklings on the San
Diego Freeway Monday morning. "Traffic came to a halt so several of
us could park and walk on to the freeway to rescue the birds," she
said. "No one honked or got impatient. A tow-truck driver stopped, as
did a highway patrolman. I was very touched by the kindness of so
many commuters."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe drivers will start showing more consideration for humans on
foot, as well.</TE>

<TE>   Color me blue: Not that you asked, but one of the family dramas of
our vacation was selecting the color our house would be painted. I
had no idea of the countless choices. When I was a kid, it seemed
like there were only about eight colors (had purple even been
invented by then?). Anyway, I wanted something appropriate for
Southern California and pointed out that the Benjamin Moore index
contained one disaster hue, one snack food color and one shade seen
occasionally by motorists (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   These were all vetoed by Mrs. Only in L.A., along with some snappy
names in the rival Valspar color index: Dinner Mint, Green With Envy,
Aloof and Paper Bag (even though the latter displayed no wrinkles).
My other choice, Dodger Blue, wasn't even offered.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, we chose a shade lighter--and, I hope, prouder--than
Green With Envy. I can't remember what it's called, because I think
I've gone temporarily colorblind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Dodger Blue: When I returned to work, I was surprised
to find the headline, "Dive Dodger Stadium," in the scuba publication
of Reef Seekers Dive Co. of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it had rented the stadium this Sunday and would
"have it flooded" for a "once-in-a-lifetime scuba diving opportunity"
at $75 per person (includes a free Dodger towel). "Our depth is
limited by the height of the outfield bleachers, but we still should
get 40 to 50 feet out of it," the newsletter said (the Dodgers are,
of course, out of town that day).</TE>
<TE>   The dugouts and clubhouses will be available for underwater
exploration but "because these will now represent an overhead
environment, you must be cave-certified," Reef Seekers said. "We will
be able to conduct a special mini-class (extra cost of $50) and guide
you through."</TE>
<TE>   I found it odd that I hadn't heard about this unique event until
now. I wondered if there was any significance to the date of the
newsletter: April 1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: On its local radio station (1500-AM), the city of
Beverly Hills announced an "early bird special" at one municipal lot

before 10 a.m. qualifies you as an early bird in Beverly Hills.</TE>

<HD>State Seeks Portion of Ormond Beach</HD>
<DH>Environment: Coastal Conservancy has appraised the 309
acres and intends to meet with Oxnard leaders. City considers a
master plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of a state conservation agency plan to meet this month with
Oxnard officials to pursue the purchase of 309 acres at Ormond Beach
as part of a statewide push to preserve coastal habitat.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Brand, point man in Ventura County for the Coastal
Conservancy, said his agency has completed an appraisal of the
property--jointly owned by the city and the Metropolitan Water
District--and is ready to begin negotiating for some or all of the
acreage on the south Oxnard shoreline.</LD>
<LD>   The conservancy can't make a formal offer until the Legislature
approves its budget for next fiscal year, which will be July 1 at the
earliest. But Brand said he hopes to forge a deal before then, adding
that the conservancy might be willing to make a down payment on the
property with an option to buy.</LD>
<TE>   "We've written [city officials], assuring them of our continued
strong interest in the acquisition," Brand said Monday. "We've
established a fair market value for the property, and we hope in a
few weeks to sit down and discuss that value with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We think they'll see it as a fair price," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard City Council is set today to discuss the future of
Ormond Beach, the county's largest remaining tract of undeveloped
coastline and the focus of competing interests.</TE>
<TE>   Wedged between the Pacific Ocean and the fertile Oxnard Plain, the
1,404-acre stretch of wind-swept beachfront is home to some of the
county's heaviest industry and some of its most fragile wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Although city leaders have called for a master plan for the entire
area, much of today's discussion is expected to focus on the 309
acres co-owned by the city and water district.</TE>
<TE>   Several businesses have expressed interest in building on that
property, including a pitch by Houston-based Sysco Corp., North
America's largest food-service marketer and distributor, to establish
a regional headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Coastal Conservancy has said it wants to buy
all the acreage the city is willing to sell. The conservancy hopes to
shield as much of the shoreline property as possible from
development.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will consider directing staff members to draft a
wetlands restoration and management plan for the property and to
review the possibility of creating an assessment district to help pay
for restoration.</TE>
<TE>   The council also will consider asking the water district what
interest it has, if any, in selling all or a portion of the 309 acres
to the Coastal Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kinney, president of the Greater Oxnard Economic Development
Corp., said he believes the council is dedicated to protecting the
wetlands and other sensitive habitat.</TE>
<TE>   But he said it's also important to provide economic development
opportunities at Ormond Beach because it is one of the few prime
sites left in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "There's room enough to satisfy these different interests," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Brand said the conservancy is talking to other
property owners in the area about purchasing an additional 400 acres
as part of its wetlands restoration project at Ormond Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't a choice between wetlands and development--clearly
there's a lot of room for both," Brand said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An autopsy found no bruising or paint splatters that would prove an
inline skater was hit by paint balls before he fell and hit his head
last month in Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve as authorities
initially believed, police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Michael Holdren, 54, of Newport Beach was in a coma for two
weeks after the fall and was declared dead Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "As a result of the physician and subsequent coroner's
investigation, they determined that there was no evidence to
substantiate that Mr. Holdren was directly hit by any paint balls,"
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Steve Shulman said. "That's not to indicate
that he couldn't fall as a result of [other] paint-ball activity, but
right now, there's nothing to indicate that it was directly
paint-ball related. It could have been some other kind of
distraction--cars, bicycles or other roller-bladers."</LD>
<TE>   The autopsy also revealed that what appeared to be external head
injuries were actually internal injuries caused by the fall, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some head trauma and bruising and swelling of an eye,
and the coroner determined that injury was [the] result of hitting
his head," Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   The police have two witnesses who saw three youths shooting paint
balls in the area, and saw splattered paint and other debris where
Holdren fell, Shulman said. Police are still seeking the youths.</TE>
<TE>   "At this particular point, we're looking into all the areas with
regard to how he could have fallen," Shulman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to exclude anything, and we're not going to be so
focused on paint balls that we're not going to look at anything
else."</TE>

<HD>Pressure Rises to Parole Killer</HD>
<DH>Prison: Legislators urge Davis to free woman who shot her
abusive husband. He has granted only one request since taking office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The beatings began on her wedding night and continued, Cheryl Sellers
says, for four years. They ended one June evening in 1983, when her
husband threatened to kill her daughter and make her watch.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't let that happen," Sellers said. So she killed him
instead.</LD>
<LD>   Sellers has spent 19 years behind bars for the killing, and now
stands on the cusp of release. State parole commissioners have
concluded that battered woman syndrome drove Sellers to kill, and
have cleared her to go home.</LD>
<TE>   Before she is freed, however, Sellers must pass muster with Gov.
Gray Davis, who will decide by Wednesday whether to uphold the parole
board's decision or keep the inmate in prison.</TE>
<TE>   History suggests the odds are poor for Sellers and five other
battered women convicts seeking the governor's blessing. Since his
election, Davis has approved parole for only one of 84 convicted
murderers deemed ready for release by the Board of Prison Terms,
whose members he appoints. And though the one murderer Davis agreed
to set free was a battered woman, he has denied other parole requests
from women in similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Davis must consider the issue in an election year, and must
weigh his desire to preserve a law-and-order image against the risk
of appearing heartless toward women who have been abused.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature's women's caucus is adding to the governor's
dilemma. Its chairwoman, Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), has
demanded a meeting with him to request freedom for Sellers and a
second inmate, and to discuss the broader issue of battered women
seeking parole.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has been very sensitive to the issues of violence
against women, and we are encouraging him to recognize that these
[inmates] were victims too," said Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica).</TE>
<TE>   The president of the Senate, Democrat John Burton of San
Francisco, also is urging Davis to release Sellers, while Sen.
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) is lobbying him on behalf of another
inmate who killed her batterer.</TE>
<TE>   Even Davis' gubernatorial opponent, Republican Bill Simon Jr., has
weighed in, sending the governor a letter urging that he apply
"discretion and judgment, not rigid, absolute policies," in deciding
the Sellers matter.</TE>
<TE>   While the former prosecutor said it would be inappropriate for him
to tell Davis what to do, he called the case compelling and said the
outcome of her trial might have been different had a defense based on
battered woman syndrome been available at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "Parole boards rightly have been using considerable caution ...
before granting parole to someone convicted of such a serious
offense," Simon wrote. "Yet they did choose to grant parole to Ms.
Sellers."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the governor, Byron Tucker, said Davis would
"review these cases extremely carefully, as he does all parole cases
sent to him." Tucker also noted that the one murderer Davis has
released--Rose Ann Parker--was a battered woman found to have shot
her abusive boyfriend out of fear for her life.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1999 Campaign Pledge Not to Free Killers</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the governor's record regarding parole adds up to an
illegal policy rooted in his 1999 pledge to keep all killers in
prison. They also say his actions are driven by politics--namely, the
fear that a paroled ex-convict would commit a new crime and wind up
in a campaign ad against him.</TE>
<TE>   The governor disputes that notion, insisting that he gives each
case an unbiased look and acts with public safety in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the high-profile nature of the battered women's cases,
advocates for the inmates are not hopeful. Already this year, they
note, Davis has rejected parole for two battered women declared ready
for freedom by the Board of Prison Terms.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Henrietta Briones, 42, who killed her boyfriend,
Lawrence Daniels, in 1986 and was sentenced to 17 years to life. In
approving her parole, the board said witnesses recounted Briones'
frequent bruises and black eyes. At the trial, a Compton police
detective said officers had been to the couple's home several times
on domestic violence calls.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis said that although Briones may have been abused, her
claim that she fired in self-defense is unsubstantiated by the facts
and is rejected by prosecutors. Though a prison psychiatrist said
Briones would pose no risk if released, the governor said she remains
a threat to society.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patterns of Violence Destroy Self-Esteem</TE>
<TE>   Battered woman syndrome is a behavioral condition that some
experts say afflicts women who are systematically abused. The pattern
of violence, those experts say, destroys their self-esteem and leaves
them feeling powerless. Many stay in abusive relationships because
they feel responsible for the problem, lack money or fear reprisals
or social isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Studies of battered women who kill their abusers--there are an
estimated 4,500 nationwide--show that they differ from other female
inmates. They tend to be older and better educated, they have few if
any prior offenses, most were married at the time of their crime, and
they more often are white.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Leonard, a sociologist who published a study of 42
battered women at the California Institution for Women in Corona,
said that by the time they killed their batterers, all of them had
taken some action to escape the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Some had been to shelters, many made calls to police, some had
restraining orders" from courts, Leonard said. Many, she notes,
"perceive that every possible escape route away from the terror is
closed off from them and the only apparent avenue to end the ongoing
violence is through suicide or homicide."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of battered women in prison became a significant issue in
the early 1990s, when advocates filed clemency petitions on behalf of
34 California inmates. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson granted clemency to
three of them and rejected 10. Most of the others remain in prison,
their petitions dubbed pending by the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the issue has been revived, in part because the Board of
Prison Terms now reviews inmates' cases for evidence of battered
woman syndrome. Under new regulations passed by the Legislature, the
board must consider such evidence as a mitigating factor when
deciding on parole.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are studied by a team of investigators who research the
crime, interview witnesses and detectives and dig up old documents.
In 2001, 36 cases were reviewed and 14 inmates were found to have
suffered from battered woman syndrome at the time of their crimes. Of
those, eight so far have been given parole grants by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Sellers, 43, convicted of first-degree murder for
shooting her husband as he lay in bed.</TE>
<TE>   At her parole hearing in December, she told the board that Norman
Sellers began abusing her on their wedding night, when he shoved her
against a bathroom wall, put his arm to her throat and raped her
because she had not come to the bedroom quickly enough.</TE>
<TE>   Another time, she said, he kicked her repeatedly in the stomach,
causing her to miscarry. On a third occasion, she said, he shot her
in the leg for moving when he told her not to.</TE>
<TE>   Dave McAuley, chief of investigations for the parole board, said
his team gathered validating evidence from another woman who had
lived with Norman Sellers and also experienced abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a clear pattern," McAuley said in an interview. "When
he was with this other woman, he was a batterer in training. With
Sellers, the abuse escalated. The feeling was that eventually, she
probably would have died [at his hands]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Case to Be Decided This Month</TE>
<TE>   The other woman whose case the governor must decide this month is
Valere Boyd, 41. Like Sellers, Boyd had no criminal record. She shot
her husband, Kermit Boyd, in 1985 after suffering what investigators
concluded was years of physical and mental abuse.</TE>
<TE>   At her parole hearing, Boyd said her husband had tried to run her
off the road, had pushed her out of a moving truck and had broken
down their front door after she had nailed it shut the night of the
crime. Once, when she called the police for help, she said he ripped
the phone out of the wall before beating her severely.</TE>
<TE>   "So therefore," she told the parole board, "I really didn't try to
call the police on him anymore."</TE>
<TE>   McAuley, who investigated Boyd's case, said the abuse from her
husband created cumulative stress that contributed to the killing.
The trial judge, who supports her release, wrote a letter to the
board calling the crime "completely out of context for Ms. Boyd."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Brian McCarville, now a Superior Court judge in San
Bernardino, opposed parole. He said he believes the key to that
night's events lies in Boyd's statement in a probation report: "I
guess my temper really got me in trouble this time."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers and Boyd were convicted in the mid-1980s, before expert
testimony about battered woman syndrome was routinely permitted in
court. Lawyers for the women argue that had such testimony been
allowed, they might have been found guilty of lesser crimes carrying
shorter sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Some prosecutors, however, see it differently, arguing that women
often use stories of beatings as an excuse for cold-blooded murder.</TE>
<TE>   In Sellers' case, for example, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist.
Atty. Keith Thompson called the inmate's accounts of abuse
self-serving and fabricated, and said she had also "flip-flopped" on
her account of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "The version she's selling now is, 'Oh, I suffered from battered
woman syndrome,'" Thompson said. "It's really been a bandwagon here
that people are jumping on.... If there's credible proof, fine, a
person deserves the credit. But when there is not any credible proof,
they don't."</TE>
<TE>   Parker, the one convicted murderer released by Davis, lives in San
Bernardino, where she runs a ministry to counsel young women on
domestic violence and tries to make up for lost time with her three
children.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Parker said she hopes Davis will think hard about
those women inmates who "have survived violent relationships."</TE>
<TE>   "I thank him for taking a chance on me," Parker said. "I know it's
an election year, but God will bless him and give him wisdom to do
what's right."</TE>

<HD>Radio Call Prompts Priest's Removal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Allegations state he molested boys while
wrestling more than a decade ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A priest has been removed as head of a Santa Barbara County seminary
and reported to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for
allegedly molesting boys during wrestling matches more than a decade
ago at a Catholic school in La Canada Flintridge.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Christopher Kearney, a former teacher at St. Francis High
School, was removed from his position as guardian of the San Lorenzo
Seminary in Santa Ynez two weeks ago and reported to sheriff's
deputies, said Father Gregory Coiro, spokesman for Capuchin
Franciscans.</LD>
<LD>   Kearney, 59, has been sent by the order for "an evaluation," Coiro
said, and could not be reached for comment. His removal was prompted
by an anonymous call last month to the Tom Leykis radio talk show,
Coiro said. The caller alleged that Kearney, who taught at St.
Francis from 1970 to 1995, molested him while the two were wrestling
at the school several years ago, Coiro said. Kearney was transferred
from St. Francis in 1995, after allegations he had molested another
student during an impromptu wrestling match two decades earlier.</LD>
<TE>   Coiro said the school paid an out-of-court settlement to the
former student but would not disclose the terms because of a
confidentiality agreement. The case was not reported to police, Coiro
said, because "our legal counsel determined it was not necessary" at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   "However with the latest allegation, the archdiocese [of Los
Angeles] thought it was appropriate to report it to the Sheriff's
Department," Coiro said. Sheriff's Department officials confirmed
they received the report, which was filed at the La Crescenta
station, but would not comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney's removal comes weeks after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
fired eight priests who had been involved in past molestations. The
Capuchin Franciscans operate independently of the Los Angeles
Archdiocese, which covers Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties. The order staffs churches, schools and seminaries.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney's case was mentioned in one of dozens of e-mails among top
archdiocese officials obtained by KFI-AM radio last week and given to
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   An archdiocesan official said: "Father Kearney used to supervise
Saturday detention. Kids could get [to] leave early if [they] would
wrestle with him. The winner was the one who could grab the other's
testicles while wrestling," according to a March 22 e-mail from
Monsignor Richard Loomis to other archdiocese officials.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese alleges the e-mails were stolen, and the FBI is
investigating. Attorneys for the archdiocese failed last week to have
a judge block publication of the e-mails in The Times. KFI officials
said the e-mails came from an anonymous source.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney did not have contact with minors at the seminary in Santa
Ynez, Coiro said, and there are no allegations of misconduct there.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing internal ministry and very little external ministry
in the parish," Coiro said. For a decade the seminary has been a
retreat for priests and no longer has novice students. A few
residents of nearby Solvang attend Mass there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   St. Francis officials said in a March 26 letter to parents that
there have been no molestations reported at the school since
Kearney's departure.</TE>
<TE>   "As you are aware this is a very unpleasant time for the Catholic
Church," the letter began. The letter told parents about the
anonymous call to the radio show and explained the 1995 allegations
against Kearney, saying school officials were striving "to balance
compassion for the individual with concern for the common good."</TE>
<TE>   "At that time the situation was dealt with swiftly and
appropriately. [Kearney] was immediately removed from St. Francis
High School," wrote Father Matthew G. Elshoff, school president, and
D. Allen Lund, chairman of the board.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Allege Placentia Police Abuse</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Pickets say officers target
Spanish-speaking residents but the force denies bias allegations.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 40 demonstrators gathered outside the Placentia Police
Department Monday evening to protest what they called a pattern of
abuse by police officers, mostly against residents of Latino descent.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a pattern over time," said Lupe Lopez, spokeswoman for
Anaheim-based Indigenous Alliance, which organized the demonstration
along with several other groups. . "This [protest] is a steppingstone
to give voice to people who have had no voice for so long."</LD>
<LD>   Lopez said the alleged abuse--mostly in the form of harassment,
intimidation and what she said is the unwarranted arrest of innocent
Spanish-speaking people--has been going on for a number of years. The
most recent incident was at a March 30 party, when several people
were attacked with pepper spray and three were arrested, she said.</LD>
<TE>   "They didn't like us taking pictures of their badges," said Amalia
Cortez, 17, hostess of the Saturday night party. She said she and
others were taking pictures to document possible harassment. She said
she had her arm pulled by one of about 12 officers, was hit with
pepper spray and arrested for an offense she said she doesn't
understand. "I don't want this to happen to our community," she said.
"I've lived here my whole life and this isn't right."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Eric Point, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the
officers were responding to noise complaints from neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was unaware of the details of the confrontation and had
not received a formal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a complaint," he said, "it will be investigated. Beyond
that I can't comment."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the alleged pattern of harassment and discrimination,
Point said, "Our chief doesn't condone it, nor does this department
engage in any kind of racial profiling or discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   One demonstrator--who declined to give her name because she said
she feared repercussions--distributed police-misconduct complaint
forms, along with instructions on how to fill them out. In the past,
she said, people who considered filing complaints said they were
dissuaded from doing so by officers threatening to counter with
lawsuits charging defamation of character.</TE>
<TE>   "We are providing a safe haven," the activist said, "for those who
have witnessed or suffered intimidation. We are letting them know
that it is within their civil rights to file complaints."</TE>
<TE>   By evening's end, she said, she had given complaint forms to seven
people, all of whom promised to fill them out and return as a group
to file them, perhaps as soon as Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other protesters waved signs reading, "No More Racist
Attacks," and "End Racist Police Terrorism," while chanting "No
Justice, No Peace," and shouting at the drivers of passing cars, some
of whom honked back in apparent support.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to observe and see what can be done," said Ruth Shapin,
a member of the Orange County Unitarian Church's Social Concerns
Committee, which supported the demonstration. "Some of the people who
have been having these problems are members of our church."</TE>
<TE>   The gathering caused no traffic or safety problems, Point said,
though at one point, protesters began surrounding a patrol car
stopped at a traffic light in the 400 block of East Chapman Avenue,
where the demonstration occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators took off as soon as another officer showed up,
Point said. "I don't know what their intentions were."</TE>

<HD>Rats Chewed on Corpses, Coroner Says</HD>
<DH>Morgue: The 12 unidentified or unclaimed bodies had been
held up to seven years. Officials say the problem is resolved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rats have gnawed 12 bodies held in long-term storage by the Los
Angeles County coroner's office, the department's director said
Monday, but he insisted the infestation is under control.</LD>
<LD>   Exterminators were called to set traps Feb. 13 after rat droppings
were found in the long-term storage crypt where dozens of unclaimed
or unidentified bodies were kept, said Anthony T. Hernandez, director
of the department of coroner. More traps were set Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But a coroner's employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
told The Times that the traps were not set until last week--even
though workers had complained of improper storage of some bodies a
year ago.</LD>
<TE>   One of those who learned recently of the grisly rodent problem was
Olga Jauregui. She was trying to scrape together enough money or
charity to bury her stepbrother when she received a call from an
official at the coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   "He said: 'I have something really bad to tell you about your
brother,' she recalled. "I thought, My God, he's already dead. What
could be so bad?"</TE>
<TE>   She soon learned. Her stepbrother Robert Salandino's corpse had
been gnawed on by rats.</TE>
<TE>   County documents on Salandino's case indicate that workers
discovered rodent damage to his face, mouth and right arm March 20,
nearly two months after he was found dead, the victim of a homicide.
Officials had removed his body after his stepsister agreed to make
burial arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   A coroner's employee "was instructed to complete an incident
report and initiate a full inspection of the [long-term storage
crypt] to see if any other bodies had been impacted," David Campbell,
a coroner's office spokesman, wrote in case notes to the file.</TE>
<TE>   The inspection showed rats had partially eaten 12 bodies,
including Salandino's, at times gnawing through sheets of thick
plastic in which bodies are wrapped to retard decomposition.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs obtained by The Times document damage to five bodies,
which have been stored a few months to seven years. The bodies are in
various stages of decomposition because refrigeration does not stop
the process, only slows it.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said it can take months to identify or find relatives of
the dead and that his office puts off cremation at the county morgue
because he would rather relatives receive a loved one's body than a
box of ashes.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 bodies are housed in the long-term crypt where the rats
were found, which is separate from the other crypts where bodies are
initially kept.</TE>
<TE>   Workers complain that the bodies ought to be disposed of more
quickly or better storage techniques should be used.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that the bodies are not being embalmed,
disinfected or preserved," the anonymous source said. He said the
resulting rat infestation is a public health hazard.</TE>
<TE>   "What if we get bitten by them? Or what if they go into the
community and are eaten by a domestic cat?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he does not think decomposition attracted the rats.
Instead, he thinks they entered through a crack in the wall, which he
has had patched.</TE>
<TE>   "I think somebody's getting a little excited about what took
place," he said. It is the first time in 30 years that the office has
been infested by rats, he said.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich is asking for an investigation
and report in two weeks.</TE>

<LD>A former NHL player and Olympic gold medalist pleaded not guilty
Monday in San Bernardino County court to four felony charges stemming
from a January hit-and-run crash in Ontario.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say Anatoli Semenov of Anaheim Hills was driving his
BMW on Jan. 27, when it rear-ended a car, which in turn struck a
truck. One person was injured. When police arrived, the BMW's driver
had left the scene. The next morning, Semenov reported the BMW
stolen, the D.A. said.</LD>
<LD>   Semenov, 40, who played with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and other
teams, faces up to five years in state prison if convicted of leaving
the scene of an accident, falsely reporting his car had been stolen
and trying to defraud his insurance company, authorities said.</LD>

<HD>Sanchez Grew More Violent, Court Told</HD>
<DH>Crime: Prosecutors say the admitted rapist displayed a
pattern that led to student's slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to show a pattern of escalating violence, Ventura County
prosecutors Monday launched their case against murder suspect Vincent
Sanchez by presenting evidence of numerous sexual assaults the
unemployed handyman committed over five years.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, has pleaded guilty to more than 50 felony counts
involving the sexual assaults of seven women. But he is also accused
of killing Moorpark College student Megan Barroso, 20, during an
alleged kidnapping and rape attempt in July.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyers concede that Sanchez fatally shot Barroso with an
assault rifle. But they argue that there was no attempt to rape
her--a significant distinction, because the allegation makes Sanchez
eligible for the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   During the first day of what is expected to be a lengthy
preliminary hearing, prosecutors sought to establish a pattern of
increasingly violent sexual assaults that they contend led to
Barroso's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Police Det. Kathleen Shatz testified about six sexual
assaults, including four rapes, she investigated between 1996 and
2000.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases, the assailant broke into the victims' homes late
at night by prying off window screens or slipping through sliding
glass doors, Shatz testified.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker raped some women at knifepoint, others at gunpoint,
and was obsessed with concealing his identity. One victim was
blindfolded. Others were ordered to cover their heads with pillows.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez has admitted to four of the assaults that Shatz testified
about Monday.</TE>
<TE>   One of those victims was a 19-year-old Moorpark College student
who in September 1996 awoke to find an assailant in her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt a hand over her mouth and a knife to her throat," Shatz
testified. "He said, 'I'll kill you if you don't cooperate.'"</TE>
<TE>   After he raped her, the attacker said he knew where she went to
school and where she worked. The detective testified that when police
searched Sanchez's Simi Valley house five years later they found a
payroll stub belonging to the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Shatz testified that police also recovered underwear and jewelry
belonging to other victims.</TE>
<TE>   During cross-examination of Shatz, defense lawyers tried to show
that Sanchez was gentle and polite to the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Shatz acknowledged that, based on her interviews, none of the
women recalled her attacker using profanities. Most told police he
didn't hit them. One recalled how he tucked her back into bed after
the rape.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors tried to show Ventura County Superior Court Judge
Ken Riley that there was nothing gentle about the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they argued, the level of violence and reckless behavior
escalated.</TE>
<TE>   A 25-year-old Simi Valley woman told Shatz she was kidnapped from
her home at gunpoint about 4 a.m. and taken to a field, where the
assailant made her pose for pictures before sexually assaulting her.</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, a 20-year-old Simi Valley woman was attacked at
gunpoint in the driveway of her home.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt the barrel of a handgun over her left temple," Shatz
said. The assailant threw a jacket over her head and drove away.</TE>
<TE>   She begged him not to rape her. But he took her to his house,
blindfolded her and raped her repeatedly on a sofa bed, Shatz
testified. He later told her "he better not see police at her house
or he would come back and hurt her," the detective said.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after that assault, in February 2000, a 34-year-old
Simi Valley women was stabbed in the leg by her attacker and then
dragged upstairs in her home and raped several times, Shatz
testified.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker, who videotaped the assault, threatened to slit the
throat of the woman's dog if she resisted. The woman was so
frightened she didn't report the assault. Shatz said it was uncovered
when police found the videotape in Sanchez's home.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury indicted Sanchez on murder and rape charges in
September, but the indictment was set aside last month by a Santa
Barbara County judge. Judge Frank Ochoa found there were not enough
women on the Ventura County Grand Jury and that the panel did not
represent a fair cross-section of the community as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors decided not to appeal that ruling and
refiled murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony in the preliminary hearing is scheduled to resume
Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>The spring harvest is at hand, and the Salinas Valley labor pool is
showing strains. No one is reporting a severe labor shortage, but the
peak harvest season is looming and the high cost of housing and
increased security at the Mexico border is troubling for some.</LD>
<LD>   Alonzo Bayardo, general manager of farm labor contractor Escamilla
and Sons, said that although the availability of workers remains
level, business has been affected.</LD>

<HD>Harbor City Would Have No Harbor</HD>
<DH>Secession: Staff of state lands panel says the tidelands
should remain with Los Angeles. That would deny the new municipality
nearly $14 million in revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The harbor area's bid for secession took another blow Monday, when
the staff of the State Lands Commission recommended that the proposed
city not include tidelands around the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Without the tidelands, a new harbor city would be denied $13.9
million in annual income, as well as the right to control development
at the mammoth port.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second setback in a week for harbor secession
proponents.</LD>
<TE>   On April 1, State Controller Kathleen Connell said the area would
not thrive financially if it were independent of Los Angeles, an
assessment which, if state regulators agree, could keep harbor
secession off the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than frustrating," said Andrew Mardesich, co-chairman
of the secession effort. "It's tough."</TE>
<TE>   The property comprises most of the 7,500-acre harbor, including
all of the underwater land around the port and about 67% of the dry
land.</TE>
<TE>   Lands Commission Executive Officer Paul Thayer said it would be
difficult to grant control of the land to a new city because Los
Angeles holds a state trust to manage the port.</TE>
<TE>   And the state law that regulates how such lands are managed and
developed applies to only trustee cities.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, according to Thayer's report to the commission
scheduled for this morning, a new city would be required to provide
police and fire services to the port, but might not have the money to
do so, even with the $13.9 million in tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor secessionists hope to use control of the land as leverage
to keep development in check at the expansion-hungry port.</TE>
<TE>   Connell, who chairs the Lands Commission, said she has not decided
whether to include the tidelands in a new city's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will vote on the matter after a public hearing at
9:30 a.m. today at the airport Radisson Hotel, 6225 W. Century Blvd.</TE>

<HD>Turf Battle Erupts Over Hollywood Sign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Never mind the millions of dollars in tax revenue that might be lost
if Hollywood secedes from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   What's really got city officials hopping is the future of the
Hollywood sign.</LD>
<LD>   Planners for the state commission analyzing the secession plan
recommended Monday that if Hollywood breaks away from Los Angeles,
the new city should take possession of the famous sign.</LD>
<TE>   But Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents the
area and has for many years been an advocate of Griffith Park, where
the sign is located, swears that the sign will never leave Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He will do anything in his power to keep it in Los Angeles,"
LaBonge spokeswoman Jane Galbraith said.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of an independent Hollywood drew the boundaries of
their proposed city to include the sign. But La Bonge and the City
Council asked the Local Agency Formation Commission to move the lines
to keep the sign in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge argued that under the terms of Col. Griffith J. Griffith's
grant of land, the property could be used only for a Los Angeles city
park.</TE>
<TE>   But acting on a tip from a longtime resident who lives near the
sign, secession boosters pulled the paperwork and found that the sign
does not sit on Griffith's land.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the giant sign, its letters 50 feet high and 30 feet wide,
was sold to the city in 1944 by M.H. Sherman Co., which built homes
in the Hollywood Hills. The sign, which advertised Hollywood- land
Realty Co., originally had the letters "l-a-n-d." But they fell off.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising billboard evolved into a symbol of the movie
industry, and finally of Los Angeles itself.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO Executive Officer Larry Calemine will take the staff
recommendation to the commission for action Wednesday, along with
other boundary disputes.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Universal Studios, whose property is mostly on
unincorporated Los Angeles County land, asked that its holdings in
the city of Los Angeles not be divided if the San Fernando Valley
secedes. LAFCO planners have recommended that the Universal property
be included in a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, though, has not yet given up on the Hollywood sign. On
Monday, he asked City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo to investigate the
property history.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Official's Threats Described</HD>
<DH>Crime: Treasurer allegedly said he wanted to harm two
legislators and a police official, prosecutors say. He calls charges
a politically motivated attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Monday provided details of their case against South
Gate Treasurer Albert Robles, alleging that Robles made numerous
terrifying threats against public officials, including two state
legislators and a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   Robles allegedly said he wanted to "blow the brains out" of one
legislator and rape another. He also allegedly expressed a desire to
fatally stab state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).</LD>
<LD>   Robles, prosecutors suspect, also stalked Los Angeles Councilwoman
Janice Hahn while working on one of her campaigns, forcing her once
to flee for her safety.</LD>
<TE>   The details emerged as prosecutors filed formal charges against
Robles. The 37-year-old politician stands accused of seven felony
threat charges against four people--Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh
(D-Los Angeles); state Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier); Escutia's
husband, Leo Briones; and South Gate Police Lt. Vince Avila.</TE>
<TE>   He is also charged with possessing two illegal assault weapons,
including a semiautomatic rifle.</TE>
<TE>   If he is found guilty, Robles faces a potential eight-year prison
term. At his arraignment scheduled for this afternoon, prosecutors
will request that bail be set at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential harm the defendant may cause to victims, witnesses
... who have come forward and described their terrifying encounters
with the defendant, requires ... a bail which reflects the
defendant's dangerousness," according to the document filed by the
district attorney's public integrity unit.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, through his attorneys, has denied the charges, saying that
the case is a politically motivated attempt to get back at him for
standing up to powerful politicians in southeast Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has admitted using strong language against his political
opponents, but said such language merely reflects his passionately
felt beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges are ridiculous and utterly groundless," a city
attorney, George B. Newhouse Jr., said in a statement released upon
Robles' arrest Friday. "They amount to a media stunt and a violation
of Mr. Robles' basic constitutional rights."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors paint a disturbing picture of Robles in the 16-page
court document in support of the bail amount. The legal motion
includes accounts from numerous witnesses, some of them other city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * At a March 2001 luncheon, Robles told two witnesses, one of them
a Lynwood official, that he wanted to harm Escutia and her husband.
"If I could get away with it, I'd have [Briones] killed and rape
[Escutia]." Briones said Robles once allegedly told him: "I'm not
afraid of you. I'm a ... loco. I'm crazy."</TE>
<TE>   * In June 2001, Robles allegedly told a witness that he wanted to
take Firebaugh to Tijuana, where he would "put him in the trunk of a
car and blow his ... brains out."</TE>
<TE>   * In 1999, Robles allegedly wanted one witness to relay a message
to Avila, the police officer. "Tell your friend Lt. Avila that he's a
loser, and you know what, when someone gets killed, what they should
do is shoot them in the eyes, both eyes to make sure that they're
dead."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also included evidence of other alleged threats not
included in the charges, but used to demonstrate that Robles poses a
danger to others.</TE>
<TE>   Robles allegedly told a South Gate official at a lunch meeting
last year that he wanted to harm Polanco. "If Polanco was sitting
next to me, I swear to God, I'd stab him to death and plead insanity
when I went to trial," prosecutors quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were filed in that case because, according to
prosecutors, the alleged threat never reached Polanco.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, prosecutors allege, he wouldn't let Hahn get into her car
and made threatening remarks. He once allegedly banged on her front
door, yelling for her to come out, forcing Hahn to flee through a
back door.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Hahn said Robles was angry after he was
kicked off her campaign for being too controlling.</TE>
<TE>   Though she reported the incidents to police, she did not press
charges. Robles, Hahn said, stopped bothering her after police warned
him about her concerns. Robles, she said, apparently didn't learn his
lesson in regard to other officials.</TE>
<TE>   "As you can tell, he has this history of wanting power and wanting
to control, and when that gets taken away from him, his behavior is
really inappropriate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a person can be convicted of making a threat even
if there is no intent of carrying it out. A threat can be made
verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic device.</TE>

<HD>Driver Killed as Train Hits Truck</HD>
<DH>Accidents: A produce hauler dies trying to position his rig
for a delivery in Anaheim. No one on Metrolink hurt.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Metrolink train carrying more than 100 commuters slammed into a
produce truck in Anaheim early Monday, killing the truck driver, who
was attempting a U-turn on the railroad tracks moments before the
crash, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Train 600, with its 115 passengers, was bound from Fullerton to
Irvine when it struck the tractor-trailer about 7:30 a.m. at the
Cerritos Avenue crossing, a block from Lewis Street.</LD>
<LD>   The accident affected rail service from Los Angeles to Orange
County about seven hours as authorities investigated the accident and
crews cleared wreckage and thousands of pounds of spilled vegetables.
Amtrak and Metrolink, which operate 33 trains on the route, reported
delays ranging from 30 to more than 90 minutes. Metrolink canceled
only one train.</LD>
<TE>   Killed in the crash was Jose Humberto Alvarez, 63, of Calexico, an
Imperial County border town. No other injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The impact tore Alvarez's new Peterbilt truck in half. The trailer
was twisted and pushed over on its side. The cab was dragged more
than 150 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Tomatoes, zucchini, and produce boxes littered the pavement and
railroad tracks. The smell of diesel from the truck's dislodged motor
and fuel tank filled the air. Blankets, a mattress and a Thomas Guide
map book were near the mangled cab.</TE>
<TE>   There "was a big, giant bang," said Troy Tsuchiyama, a customer
service employee at Geary Pacific Supply near the crash site. "There
was mayhem everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Mike Hidalgo, an Anaheim Police Department spokesman, said
Alvarez was attempting an illegal U-turn on the tracks to better
position his rig for a delivery at Family Tree Produce on Cerritos
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The truck became trapped on the rails, he said, as the crossing
gates descended, bells sounded and warning lights flashed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in the middle of the tracks when the arms went down,"
Hidalgo said. "You cannot make a U-turn here. The turn the driver
made was against the vehicle-safety code."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez's body was found in a shallow ditch near the cab.
Witnesses tried to revive him, but authorities pronounced him dead at
the scene. Police said they did not know how fast the train was
going. Metrolink officials said commuter trains usually travel at 65
to 70 mph through that section of Anaheim. The engineer sounded the
horn and tried an emergency stop, but he could not halt the train in
time, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred in an industrial section of Anaheim frequented
by truckers.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Gavin, a Metrolink spokeswoman, said motorists if vehicles
break down on the rails, drivers and passengers should abandon them
and immediately phone Metrolink at (800) 371-5465.</TE>
<TE>   Why Alvarez did not get out in time is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that at least one motorist honked at the truck and
waved at Alvarez from the outside of his car. The driver also turned
his vehicle around and blinked his high beams at the train.</TE>
<TE>   News of Alvarez's death stunned his co-workers at Manuel Huerta
Trucking Inc., the Arizona-based company where he had worked for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Villagomez described him as a careful, experienced driver,
who had just been rewarded by the company three weeks ago with a new
rig.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner gives the new trucks to the best drivers," said
Villagomez, who also operates a truck for Huerta. "He loved to
drive."</TE>

<TE>   The crash occurred in an industrial section of Anaheim frequented
by truckers. Drivers often sit in the center divider of Cerritos
Avenue, not far from the rail line, waiting to make their deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Gavin, a Metrolink spokeswoman, said motorists should never
stop their vehicles on tracks or try to turn around on them. If their
vehicles break down on the rails, drivers and passengers should
abandon them and immediately phone Metrolink at (800) 371-LINK.</TE>
<TE>   Once the crossing gates are activated, Gavin said, motorists have
about 30 seconds to flee their vehicles before the train arrives. Why
Alvarez did not get out in time is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that at least one motorist honked at the truck and
waved at Alvarez from the outside of his car. The driver also turned
his vehicle around and blinked his high beams to warn the oncoming
train.</TE>
<TE>   News of Alvarez's death stunned his co-workers at Manuel Huerta
Trucking Inc., the Arizona-based company where he had worked for
eight years. Pedro Villagomez described him as a careful, experienced
driver, who had just been rewarded by the company three weeks ago
with a new rig.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner gives the new trucks to the best drivers," said
Villagomez, who also operates a truck for Huerta. "He loved to

<TE>   Amtrak and Metrolink officials said stranded passengers were bused
to their stops.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the canceled train, five others were delayed
substantially between 7:30 a.m. and 2:50 p.m., when full service
resumed, Gavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink operates 22 trains on the Orange County line daily.

<HD>More Limits for O.C. Waters?</HD>
<DH>Ecology: State officials propose adding 10 areas to the
federal 'impaired' list to tighten restrictions on pollutants. Public
hearing is set for May.</DH>

<LD>State water officials propose placing three popular stretches of
beach, Dana Point Harbor, Aliso Creek and other Orange County
waterways on the federal list of polluted bodies of water.</LD>
<LD>   Should the federal government put all 10 of those proposed in
Orange County on the "impaired" list, regional water officials must
create detailed plans to limit the pollutants flowing into the
waterways--a costly, controversial process that typically takes
years.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists say these technical plans are a strong,
scientific way to cleanse the water.</LD>
<TE>   "If done correctly, they should be 100% effective," said Heather
Hoecherl, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council's Los Angeles office.</TE>
<TE>   The limits would restrict all kinds of pollution--from fertilizer
to heavy metals--from all sources.</TE>
<TE>   Already 509 water bodies in California have been declared
impaired, and must have standards in place by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   The State Water Resources Control Board has proposed adding 195
creeks, lakes, and stretches of ocean to the list, and removing 70,
including Upper and Lower Newport bays.</TE>
<TE>   Removal from the list means only that plans to limit pollution
have been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Also proposed to be added to the list are 48 bodies of water in
Los Angeles and Ventura counties, including Castlerock Beach in Santa
Monica, a stretch of Rincon Beach, and Avalon Beach on Santa Catalina
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed sites in Orange County include stretches of Huntington
State Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the first plans in the nation to limit pollution were
created for Newport Bay, covering everything from fecal matter to
silt. Parts of the bay have been off-limits for swimming and
shellfish harvesting for nearly three decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent that plan ... I don't think some of the [improvements]
would have been done," said Dave Kiff, assistant city manager.
However, Kiff said he is concerned that the state has proposed adding
1,000 feet of Newport Beach's shoreline south of the Santa Ana River
mouth to the list, saying he believes bacteria problems at the spot
represent an aberration. The city has not decided whether to contest
the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach Mayor Wayne Baglin, a former regional water quality
board member, is among the critics of the limits. He says crafting
the plans for polluted places in San Diego County consumed as much as
15% of the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board's budget
but showed few results.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional enforcement action, such as fining polluters, is far
more effective, Baglin said.</TE>
<TE>   State water officials will take public comments at three meetings
before the state board votes on its proposal in September, submits it
to the Environmental Protection Agency by Oct. 1. Federal officials
will take several months to analyze the proposal, and will take
public comments, before making a decision.The meeting for Southern
California counties is at 9 a.m. May 30 at the Doubletree Hotel, 222
N. Vineyard Ave., Ontario.</TE>

<HD>Vanpoolers Climb Aboard, Hit the Snooze Button</HD>
<DH>Sharing the ride to work provides a little extra shut-eye,
as well as a special bond among the participants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roland Holzman is a rarity in Southern California: a long-haul
commuter who gets to work rested, refreshed and, yes, even happy. His
secret to such a contented commute is not yoga exercises on the
dashboard or an illegal pharmaceutical.</LD>
<LD>   It is that much more elusive commodity: extra snooze time.</LD>
<LD>   For six years, the aerospace engineer from Santa Clarita has
shared a vanpool to El Segundo with 13 other commuters.</LD>
<TE>   He cites the environmental benefits and the wear and tear he saves
on his car. He speaks fondly of the friends he has made on the road,
friends who occasionally meet for weekend barbecues and family
outings.</TE>
<TE>   But he absolutely crows about the restful naps he gets as someone
else drives him from the northern reaches of Los Angeles County to
his job in the South Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "I get half my night's sleep here," Holzman said as he settled
into a window seat during a recent early morning drive to his work at
Boeing Satellite Systems in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   One of Holzman's vanpool colleagues, Diana Castano, a Boeing
affirmative action compliance officer, said she is completely wiped
out when she doesn't get her usual vanpool nap.</TE>
<TE>   "When I take the vanpool, I have what I call my energy nap," she
said as the vehicle sped along the Golden State Freeway. "I can then
go home and play with my kids."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, where the right to drive solo is coveted
almost as much as free speech, Holzman, Castano and their compatriots
are a rare breed who represent about 1% of the commuting public.</TE>
<TE>   They may be a small group, but they are content. Nearly 98% of
vanpoolers surveyed last year said they would recommend the practice
to others.</TE>
<TE>   Vanpoolers split the costs of leasing or renting a van and share
the driving duties. Sometimes an employer subsidizes the expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Vanpoolers tend to stay together longer than carpoolers, perhaps
because communal vans tend to be bigger and more conducive to serious
leisure than the standard carpool vehicle. Vanpools remain together
an average of four years, while carpools, on average, last 21/2
years, according to Southern California Rideshare.</TE>
<TE>   Holzman and Castano are members of a vanpool that has operated
since 1994. Both say they cannot imagine going back to commuting
alone.</TE>
<TE>   But being a member of a vanpool means joining a tight fellowship
that dispenses its own rules and restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Every weekday morning, the 14 members of the vanpool meet at the
Old Road behind a McDonald's in Santa Clarita, where a brightly
painted Ford Club Van idles at the curb.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule of vanpooling is that the clock mounted inside the
vehicle rules the day.</TE>
<TE>   "That clock is God ... but it's off," said Stephen Montaperto, a
Boeing safety specialist, as he settled into one of the middle seats
on a recent workday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Accurate or not, every vanpool member has synchronized his or her
watch with the van's digital clock. Each weekday, when that clock
strikes 5:45 a.m., the van pulls away from the curb. There is no lag
time. Even veteran vanpoolers have found themselves staring at an
empty curb at 5:46 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The second rule is that the vanpool is run like a dictatorship.
The driver decides the route and controls the radio. Vanpoolers don't
whine about the driver's choices, lest they face the same treatment
when it's their turn behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent commute, David Swartz, a Boeing engineer, jumped into
the driver's seat and tuned the radio to an all-news station.</TE>
<TE>   Before the van pulled onto the Golden State Freeway, half of the
passengers were already dozing. One pushed in a pair of ear plugs.
Another rested his head on a crescent-shaped pillow he wrapped around
his neck.</TE>
<TE>   "No one makes demands here," said Spencer Sager, a Boeing
scientist who founded the vanpool in 1994 and manages the lease
agreement with Enterprise car rental. "We are just looking for a ride
to work."</TE>
<TE>   To chronicle the long, often quiet commute, Sager keeps a small
35-millimeter camera in the glove compartment.</TE>
<TE>   Vanpoolers snap photos of the strange and funny scenes they
sometimes encounter along the road. Their commuting photo album
includes pictures of a flatbed truck hauling a huge marlin, a smiling
man pounding a pair of drumsticks on his dashboard and a female
driver holding a hairy little dog up to the steering wheel so the
mutt could pretend to drive.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly half of the photos are unflattering images of the
vanpoolers sound asleep. Most appear like dying trout--heads tilted
back, drooling mouths agape. In the background other vanpoolers are
seen smirking.</TE>
<TE>   It is one small measure of the camaraderie built over hundreds of
rides and thousands of miles.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the Northridge earthquake in 1994, Castano called
Sager in a panic. She couldn't get her electric garage door opener to
work. Sager not only explained how to open the door manually but
invited her to his house, which he has equipped with a
gasoline-powered generator and a propane barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   The vanpool group has been mostly stable, despite a few layoffs
and schedule changes.</TE>
<TE>   And the van-mates have become so close that five of them attended
the funeral when the wife of one of their fellow riders died.</TE>
<TE>   On the road, the group has endured car crashes, flat tires, road
rage and hellish traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are by yourself and you are stuck in traffic, it is you
against the world," Holzman said. "But when you are in a vanpool, you
have 13 others with you."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, the van makes good time, thanks in part to
fast-moving carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   On the recent early morning commute, the vanpool took only 38
minutes to complete the 39-mile drive to El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   On the way home, the van encountered heavy traffic in the San
Fernando Valley. Still, the 80-minute return trip was tolerable,
considering the amount of terrain covered. It also made for plenty of
snooze time.</TE>
<TE>   When the van stopped in Santa Clarita, the platoon of well-rested
vanpoolers got out, stretched, rubbed their eyes and tried to smooth
the gravity-defying hair spurs, caused by the vehicle's headrests.</TE>
<TE>   Said Castano: "That is another bad thing you should know about:
vanpool hair."</TE>

<HD>John Agar, 81; Starred in Westerns, Sci-Fi Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Agar, whose marriage to Shirley Temple in the 1940s propelled
him into an acting career that began promisingly with parts in two
classic John Ford westerns but slid into a series of low-budget
science fiction movies in the 1950s and '60s, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Agar died of emphysema Sunday at Providence Saint Joseph Medical
Center in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   During the 1950s and '60s, Agar played lead roles in about two
dozen science fiction movies, including "Revenge of the Creature,"
"Tarantula," "The Mole People" and "The Brain From Planet Arous."</LD>
<TE>   "He's one of the top science fiction heroes, based on 'Revenge of
the Creature' and 'Tarantula,' which were very high profile and very
profitable movies," said Tom Weaver, who interviewed Agar for
Fangoria and Starlog magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, Agar was a frequent guest at science fiction
conventions and autograph shows.</TE>
<TE>   But because of his early roles in Ford's "Fort Apache" and "She
Wore a Yellow Ribbon," and his later work with John Wayne in
"Chisum," "Big Jake" and "The Undefeated," Weaver said, "western fans
like to lay claim to him too."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chicago in 1921, Agar was the oldest of four children of a
meatpacker. His father died in 1935, and the family later moved to
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Agar was a 24-year-old Army Air Corps sergeant when he married the
17-year-old Temple in 1945. Agar's sister was one of Temple's
classmates at the Westlake School for Girls, and Agar had met the
child star at a pool party at her home in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   After Agar returned to civilian life, producer David O. Selznick,
who had Temple under exclusive contract, offered the handsome former
GI a movie contract--at $150 a week, acting lessons included.</TE>
<TE>   Agar made his film debut in 1948 as a young lieutenant in "Fort
Apache," starring Wayne, Henry Fonda and Temple, who played Agar's
love interest. The following year, he co-starred with Temple in
"Adventure in Baltimore," a mostly forgettable comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1949, Agar appeared with Wayne in two movies: "Sands of
Iwo Jima" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."</TE>
<TE>   The same year, Agar's four-year marriage to Temple, which produced
a daughter, Linda Susan, ended in divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "Although he got into pictures because of Shirley Temple, he
became a very good professional actor, whether in big pictures or
small pictures," said producer A.C. Lyles, who used Agar in many of
the westerns he produced at Paramount in the 1960s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a lovely person; everyone loved Jack," Lyles, a longtime
friend, said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Agar continued his acting career after the divorce. In 1951, he
appeared in "Along the Great Divide" with Kirk Douglas. The same
year, he co-starred opposite Lucille Ball in "The Magic Carpet," a
low-budget Arabian Nights adventure and the first of a number of
minor fantasy and science fiction films he made during that period.</TE>
<TE>   While under contract to Universal in the mid-'50s, Agar appeared
in four films. But with the exception of a western called "Star in
the Dust," they were all B science fiction films.</TE>
<TE>   Fearful of losing work if he rejected roles at the studio, Agar
told Weaver that "I never turned anything down."</TE>
<TE>   But by 1956, after the release of "The Mole People," which is
generally considered the worst of Universal's '50s science fiction
output, Agar was so tired of being typecast that when the option on
his contract came up for renewal, he left the studio.</TE>
<TE>   The move didn't help his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he became a freelancer, the cheapo monster movie makers came
to him, so he ended up right back in the science fiction stuff
again," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Agar later sold insurance and for many years promoted Brunswick's
senior bowling program to supplement an acting income generated by
small parts in film and TV.</TE>
<TE>   He showed up in the 1976 remake of "King Kong," as a New York City
official who supervised the blasting of Kong off the World Trade
Center. And in the '80s and '90s, filmmakers who had grown up
watching Agar's movies cast him in small parts in films such as "Body
Bags" and, most recently, "The Vampire Hunters Club."</TE>
<TE>   But having a name that was synonymous with the B science fiction
movies of the '50s and '60s never bothered Agar.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't resent being identified with them at all--why should
I?" he told Weaver in 1986. "Even though they were not considered top
of the line, for those people that like sci-fi, I guess they were
fun. My whole feeling about working as an actor is, if I give anybody
any enjoyment, I'm doing my job, and that's what counts."</TE>
<TE>   Agar was scheduled to appear at a fan show next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved it," said his son, Martin Agar, adding that Agar would
always stay until the last person in line got an autograph.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Martin, Agar is survived by his son, John III;
daughter, Linda; two brothers, Frank and James; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A private service will be held.</TE>

<HD>Maria Felix, 88; Mexican Film Icon, Worldwide Sex Symbol</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Maria Felix, an icon of the golden age of Mexican cinema and one of
the 20th century's classic Latin beauties, died here early Monday on
her 88th birthday. The cause of death was congestive heart failure,
her doctors said.</LD>
<LD>   In a career that spanned 47 movies--including the classics "Dona
Barbara," "La Cucaracha" and "Enamorada"--Felix became an
international sex symbol while creating the prototype of the strong
Latin woman, humble yet noble, irresistible yet untamable, tender yet
authoritarian.</LD>
<LD>   President Vicente Fox led Mexican political and cultural leaders
in eulogizing her, saying, "As an artist she gave everything to
Mexico, [including] a great international presence.... I admired her
very much, and we Mexicans have suffered a huge loss."</LD>
<TE>   As was the case after the deaths of other prominent Mexican
cultural figures, from painter Frida Kahlo to poet Octavio Paz, Felix
was honored Monday evening at the ornate Palacio de Bellas Artes,
where her body lay in state. Among those paying tribute were Fox and
first lady Martha Sahagun de Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Felix and rival actress Dolores del Rio, who died in 1983, are
widely considered the greatest Mexican movie stars. But unlike Del
Rio, who achieved a modicum of Hollywood success, Felix never sought
a career in the U.S. and so is unknown to many non-Latino film fans.</TE>
<TE>   But Felix, whose middle-class roots were in Sonora state, became
an icon in the Spanish-speaking world thanks to her mesmerizing
beauty and the vast reach of Mexican movies during the industry's
so-called golden age, which lasted from the late 1930s to the
mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Felix was the last survivor of the epoch whose stars included
Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Cantinflas and Pedro Armendariz.</TE>
<TE>   "She was beautiful but had a new kind of personality that
[conveyed] the idea of dominion," Mexican writer Carlos Monsivais
said Monday. "She created an alternative to the Mexican woman on
screen, who until then was just beauty or the modesty of suffering.
She empowered the idea of Mexican woman as no one before."</TE>
<TE>   That strength was perhaps best captured in her leading part as the
villainous rancher Dona Barbara, in the 1943 adaptation of the novel
of the same name by Venezuelan Romulo Gallegos. She also appeared in
the classic melodramas "Rio Escondido," "Mujer de Todos" and "Tizoc."
She won three Ariel awards, Mexico's equivalent of the Oscar, for her
performances.</TE>
<TE>   "She was unique in Mexican cinema. She may not have been our
greatest actress, but her face was certainly the most beautiful,"
said Patricia Millet de Fuentes, former president of Mexico's
National Film Chamber and granddaughter of Fernando de Fuentes, who
directed Felix in "Dona Barbara."</TE>
<TE>   The actress was awarded a lifetime achievement award at the 2000
Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival. The festival's
co-founder and artistic director, Edward James Olmos, said in a
telephone interview Monday that Felix's charisma combined "Garbo
sensuality" with the strength of Bette Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a true giant of Mexico's golden age, and she helped make
world cinema. She had a dignity and sense of strength that changed
the course of women's image on the screen," Olmos said.</TE>
<TE>   Felix was scheduled to appear to accept her award. Instead, she
addressed the audience of 1,000 by telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very conscious of her looks, and her looks had changed so
much at her age,she didn't want to be out in public anymore," Olmos
said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Alamos, Sonora, in 1914, Felix grew up in Guadalajara and
won a beauty contest as a teenager. She married a cosmetics salesman
named Enrique Alvarez and gave birth to her only child, Enrique
Alvarez Felix, in 1934. The boy later became a respected actor
himself. He died in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Felix made her screen debut opposite Negrete, who was already a
star, in the 1942 film "Penon de las Animas."</TE>
<TE>   A cult figure to fans in Latin America and Europe long after her
career ended, Felix led a lavish and tempestuous private life that
included marriages to Negrete and to Mexican composer Agustin Lara.
Her last marriage was to French millionaire Alex Berger, who died in
1974. After that, she divided her time between Mexico and France.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican publisher and memoirist Sealtiel Alatriste said in an
e-mail that he, like countless Latin American men of his generation,
considers Felix and her movies to have been part of his initiation
into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment I left my childhood behind was in the house of a
friend, where I saw a photo of a semi-nude Maria Felix, covering her
breasts, undaunted and looking off toward I don't know where. Maybe I
was 10 or 12, but the photo signaled the end of one era and the start
of another," Alatriste said.</TE>
<TE>   Monsivais said the beauty of Felix was "incredible.... To borrow
from Norma Desmond in the movie 'Sunset Boulevard,' I can only say
that 'We had faces then.'"</TE>
<TE>   "In the next few days, we will mourn someone who intimately
survives in each one of us," Alatriste said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Sends $2.1-Billion Housing Bond Issue to Davis</HD>
<DH>Legislation: The bill asks voters to fund aid to poor
people, collegians, the disabled, seniors and farm workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A $2.1-billion bond issue intended to ease California's worsening
housing shortage was passed by the Senate on Monday and sent to Gov.
Gray Davis, whose expected signature would put it before the voters
Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would provide financial help for the construction of
housing for not only low-income people, but also for university
students, farm workers, the disabled and needy seniors.</LD>
<LD>   It would also help buyers who qualified for aid in making a down
payment on their first home.</LD>
<TE>   At $2.1 billion, the legislation dwarfed the $600 million that
voters approved in bond sales for housing in the late 1980s and 1990,
the last time a housing bond issue was put on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was 27-11 and was almost entirely along party lines.</TE>
<TE>   Only Republican Sen. Bruce McPherson of Santa Cruz, a candidate
for lieutenant governor, voted with all 26 Democrats to pass the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cost of Paying for Bonds Falls to State Taxpayers</TE>
<TE>   The no votes were cast by Republicans, who complained about the
cost of financing the housing programs and subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of paying for the bonds would fall to California
taxpayers. If they were sold at an average interest rate of 5%, the
bonds would end up costing $3.5 billion in interest and principal
over their 25-year life.</TE>
<TE>   The action marked the second time in five days that a proposed
bond issue of historic cost had been delivered to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a $25.6-billion plan for construction of public
schools and higher education facilities was approved.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has promised to sign the school building bill, but has not
announced a position on the housing program (SB 1227) by Senate
leader John Burton (D-San Francisco). Administration officials have
said, however, that Davis intends to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   California for years has suffered an acute housing shortage, which
has worsened as the supply of affordable homes has shrunk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Struggling Workers to Benefit, Burton Says</TE>
<TE>   With the real estate market in many parts of California strong
even as the economy remains mixed, the gap has widened between high
housing prices and the financial ability of buyers to purchase.</TE>
<TE>   One consequence is that people must commute greater and greater
distances to their jobs because they are living in homes farther from
their workplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Burton argued that his bill, if approved by voters, would help
provide shelter for not only homeless and low-income Californians,
but also struggling workers with "modest" incomes.</TE>
<TE>   But at an Appropriations Committee hearing on the bill shortly
before it was debated by the full Senate, Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver
City) asserted that such legislation resulted in the "ghettoizing and
barrioizing" of minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   "When we build housing for 'low-income' people, we end up building
new ghettoes," Murray told Burton. Burton replied that the bill would
benefit others as well as low-income people, but added, "Your point
is well taken."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GOP Claims Democrats Caused Housing Crisis</TE>
<TE>   Murray voted for the housing bill, but Republicans attacked it as
an enterprise that the government should not engage in, and claimed
that Democrats had brought about the crisis by imposing burdensome
regulations, fees and taxes on the housing industry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   $910 Million Set for Multi-Family Housing</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, almost half the funds, $910 million, would be
spent for multiple family housing.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs that would receive multimillions include housing
for low-income students at the University of California and
California State University systems; housing for the disabled, and
for migrants and other farm workers; and emergency programs.</TE>
<TE>   Other expenditures would be on health services related to housing,
the CalHome program and down payment assistance.</TE>

<HD>Nobu McCarthy, 67; Actress on Stage and Film</HD>

<LD>Nobu McCarthy, who first attracted attention as a Hollywood starlet
and later became an accomplished stage actress and artistic director
of the pioneering Los Angeles-based theater company East West
Players, died Saturday at 67.</LD>
<LD>   She was in Londrina, Brazil, shooting "Gaijin II," a movie about
several generations of Japanese immigrants in Brazil, where her late
parents had emigrated.</LD>
<LD>   Tamlyn Tomita, an American actress also in the cast, said McCarthy
had returned to work Saturday, after a period of convalescence
following a hospitalization for pneumonia that occurred shortly after
her arrival in Brazil on March 9. She was stricken on the set
Saturday with what doctors diagnosed as an aneurysm in her aorta,
Tomita said. Production of the movie was suspended.</LD>
<TE>   Born as Nobu Atsumi in Ottawa, Canada, where her father Masagi
Atsumi was a private secretary to the Japanese ambassador, McCarthy
was brought to Japan as a baby. She trained at the Pavlova School of
Ballet in Kamakura, Japan, from 1947 to 1953, sang with choral groups
on stage and radio, and became a successful model. She was named Miss
Tokyo in the competition leading up to the Miss Universe pageant.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, she married U.S. Army Sgt. David McCarthy, a match her
parents opposed. The newlyweds moved to Los Angeles. "When I first
came here," McCarthy told The Times in a 1960 interview, "I just knew
greetings and 'I love you.' I thought I knew everything and then I
found I didn't, and I was scared to go out. But adjustment wasn't
very hard for me. It's amazing the way people helped me."</TE>
<TE>   Spotted by an agent in Little Tokyo, she was sent to an audition
at Paramount Pictures and got a role in the Jerry Lewis comedy "The
Geisha Boy" in 1958. Among the other titles from her busiest period
in Hollywood, in the late '50s and early '60s, were "The Hunters,"
"Wake Me When It's Over," "Walk Like a Dragon" and "Love With the
Proper Stranger."</TE>
<TE>   Her TV series credits included "Perry Mason," "Wagon Train" and
"Mister Ed."</TE>
<TE>   George Takei, who later became famous for the role in Sulu in
"Star Trek," said his first paying job as an actor was in a
"Playhouse 90" TV production in which he played McCarthy's fiance and
suspected killer. "At that time, she was not really a trained
actress," Takei said. "But she had extraordinary beauty and charm.
And she was a very conscientious student who studied hard and
transformed herself into a fine actress."</TE>
<TE>   "She was very unassuming," recalled Mako, the actor and director
whom McCarthy later would succeed as artistic director of East West
Players. "The girl-next-door type, as opposed to a brash young star."</TE>
<TE>   Mako and others founded East West, the country's first Asian
American theater company, in 1965. McCarthy was not actively involved
with it then.</TE>
<TE>   However, after withdrawing from acting in the late '60s, followed
by a divorce in 1970, McCarthy returned to her career via East West,
joining the company in 1971 and playing a number of roles on its
small stage, then on Santa Monica Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "We all liked her," Mako said. "She became a very steady actress,
although she had arthritis that sometimes made her move in a way that
looked older than she was."</TE>
<TE>   During her later career, her screen appearances diminished in
number but grew in substance. She was in the landmark TV movie
"Farewell to Manzanar" in 1976, in the commercial hit "Karate Kid II"
in 1986, "Pacific Heights" in 1990 and "The Painted Desert" in 1993,
as well as a variety of TV series guest appearances.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, East West Players went through a turbulent period, with
Mako resigning under pressure from the board. McCarthy was selected
as his replacement and served as artistic director until 1993. During
her tenure, the group's board and fund-raising were expanded, and she
made an effort to open up the theater's programming and
behind-the-scenes activities to non-Asians and, within the Asian
American community, to non-Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "She brought her calming influence to the group, broadened the
outreach, and brought a sense of balance and stability," Takei said.</TE>
<TE>   Her successor, Tim Dang, still the group's artistic director,
credited McCarthy with providing opportunities to him and to many
other young Asian American artists. McCarthy and her second husband,
the late William Cuthbert, received a lifetime achievement award from
East West in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy also acted at other theaters in the late '80s and early
'90s. She played one of the two leading roles in Philip Kan Gotanda's
"The Wash" at the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York, the Mark Taper
Forum in L.A. and in a film version that was shown on public
television.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so natural," Gotanda recalled. "When I directed her, I
just sort of let her be. She could run a large gamut of emotions. If
you wanted darkness, she could go there. She also could seem to be
the most innocent person on the face of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy is survived by two children from her first marriage,
Marlon of Monrovia and Serena of Northern California; and three
brothers.</TE>

<LD>Raven Chanticleer, 72, founder and owner of New York's African
American Wax and History Museum, a tiny but impressive space in
Harlem filled with two dozen statues of black heroes, died March 31
in New York City of lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born James Watson in Woodruff, S.C., the son of sharecroppers, he
invented a colorful name and persona for himself as he studied at the
Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and became a fashion
designer, dancer, sculptor and storyteller.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by a visit to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London,
where he was offended to find no African figures, he founded his own
wax museum in Harlem in 1989. Chanticleer made his wax figures and
designed and stitched their costumes. Among his likenesses are
Harriet Tubman, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Magic
Johnson, Duke Ellington and Raven Chanticleer.</LD>
<TE>   He included himself, he once said, "just in case something should
happen to me, if they didn't carry out my wishes and my dreams of
this wax museum I would come back and haunt ... them."</TE>

<LD>William Diebold, 84, an economist who helped mold economic policy
based on free trade after World War II, died April 2 in Upper Nyack,
N.Y., of congestive heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Diebold, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations for more
than five decades, was a strong supporter of the postwar Bretton
Woods economic system that emphasized free trade. As a member of the
council's war and peace studies program and through the Office of
Strategic Services, he exercised major influence with government
policymakers.</LD>
<LD>   An orthodox liberal economist educated at Swarthmore, Yale and the
London School of Economics, Diebold wrote numerous books on economic
issues. Among them were "New Directions in Our Trade Policy" in 1941,
"Trade and Payments in Western Europe" in 1952 and "Industrial Policy
as an International Issue" in 1980.</LD>

<HD>Senate Votes to Repeal Law Barring Cell Phones in School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Senate voted 38-1 without debate Monday to repeal a 14-year-old
law that prohibits children from taking cell phones and pagers to
school.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, sponsored by government class students at Woodbridge
High in Irvine and James Logan High in Union City, would allow local
school boards to decide whether the electronic communicators should
be allowed on campus and used during school hours.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), the bill's author, said there is
general agreement that use of a personal cell phone may make the
difference between life and death during an emergency, such as the
fatal shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   The bill, which now goes to the Assembly, would repeal a 1988
state prohibition against bringing cell phones and other
communication devices to school. At the time, it was aimed mostly at
preventing illegal drug deals that were conducted with the use of
pagers.</TE>
<TE>   The bill (SB 1253) contains an unusual disclaimer saying it is
"not the intent of the Legislature to encourage pupils to use
electronic signaling devices at school."</TE>

<HD>Yucca Priest Quits Over 1992 Crime</HD>
<DH>Catholics: His strip- search of boys in Indiana had become
public. Parishioners are divided over his resignation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaving a high-desert Roman Catholic parish bitterly divided, a Yucca
Valley priest has resigned amid revelations that he strip-searched a
group of seventh- and eighth-grade boys a decade ago in Indianapolis
when the boys were accused of setting off stink bombs in a classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Father Ponciano Ramos, the administrator and pastor of St. Mary's
Catholic Church in Yucca Valley, resigned over the weekend, officials
from the Diocese of San Bernardino said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The voluntary resignation was announced to the 800 families who
attended Mass at St. Mary's. Father Howard Lincoln, a priest who acts
as a spokesman for the diocese, read the parishioners a letter from
Bishop Gerald R. Barnes after Sunday services, said Richard Sroda, a
church member.</LD>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe what he was saying," Sroda said Monday. "He
went straight to the point. He said that he had resigned. We were
silent. Everybody kind of looked at each other and then, since it was
the end of the Mass, we just kind of quietly left. Then I got back
home and I thought, 'Did I really hear what I thought I heard?'"</TE>
<TE>   The issue has upset members of St. Mary's much the way the larger
moral crisis enveloping the Catholic church has demoralized and
divided Catholics around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Ramos' parishioners think he made a mistake, paid for it
and was unfairly forced out, while others believe Ramos is not fit to
be a priest.</TE>
<TE>   According to church officials, court records and associates of
Ramos, the priest pleaded guilty in 1993 to three misdemeanors in
connection with the strip-search.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Ramos was a priest at St. Rita's Catholic Church and
the director of St. Rita's Catholic School, in the Indianapolis area.
In 1992, at the school, two stink bombs were set off in a classroom,
and the principal, a nun, asked Ramos to question a dozen students
about the incident, Lincoln said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos allegedly strip-searched some of the boys, Lincoln said, and
touched at least one boy's genitals as part of his search. Initially
charged with three felonies, Ramos, 55, struck a plea bargain and was
sentenced to 18 months of probation.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln and other church officials said that prosecutors conceded
they had no evidence that Ramos conducted the strip search for sexual
gratification.</TE>
<TE>   "But I would consider it extremely inappropriate behavior with
children," Lincoln said. "It was just extraordinarily poor judgment."</TE>
<TE>   Ramos is a member of the Society of the Divine Word, a religious
order based in Illinois, said Bill Lemann, a lay spokesman for the
Diocese of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Following Ramos' guilty plea, he was transferred to Murietta by
the society, and then to Yucca Valley. The Society of the Divine
Word, which could not be reached for comment Monday, never told the
Diocese of San Bernardino about Ramos' plea bargain. Neither did
Ramos himself, Lincoln said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident came to light because the mother of one of the boys
in Indiana learned that Ramos was a pastor in California. She said
she had thought that he had been reassigned to work that would keep
him away from children altogether. The mother brought the case to the
attention of the news media, which alerted church officials late last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Among Ramos' defenders is William Agre, a maintenance man and
parishioner at the Yucca Valley church, and his wife, Mary, the
church secretary. The couple were so fond of Ramos that they followed
him from his first California assignment, in Murietta, to Yucca
Valley four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Agre said the resignation has affected the lives of many
parishioners. Four brides had wanted Ramos to officiate at their
weddings, and plans to conduct confirmation for a group of high
school students this month are now up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in our church is in tears," Agre said Monday. "It was a
mistake. He served his time."</TE>
<TE>   Agre said Ramos, who could not be reached for comment Monday, was
very cautious around children in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence, Lemann said, that Ramos abused children
during his term with the Diocese of San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is a sign of the times," Lemann said. "It makes it
very difficult when the revisionists can come in and challenge
something that took place ... years ago. You're caught up in it, and
that's unfortunate. Teachers taught differently 20 years ago. Parents
raised their children differently 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   But Lincoln said the Catholic church must act on revelations of
improper behavior, no matter when they occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the dioceses are being extremely vigilant now," he said.
"We want to convey to our people that they can feel very confident
that the diocese has a comprehensive sexual abuse policy and that it
is going to be followed, and that our diocese will never assign to
any ministry any priest who has abused children."</TE>
<TE>   Arguments like Lemann's, said Sroda, are merely another way for
the Catholic church to act as an apologist for priests that abuse
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can measure this in degrees," Sroda said. "I
think abuse is abuse and a violation is a violation."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for Yosemite killer Cary Stayner on Monday sought to bar his
confession from his triple-murder trial, pressing two FBI agents for
details on how he was arrested.</LD>
<LD>   On the third day of a hearing on whether the FBI improperly
obtained Stayner's confession, his defense lawyer asked when Stayner
was read his Miranda rights, when he knew he was under arrest and how
the FBI got a search warrant for his car.</LD>
<LD>   Echoing the testimony of other agents, Agent John Boles said
Stayner appeared willing to talk even after being read his rights.</LD>
<TE>   Stayner has admitted killing Yosemite National Park sightseers
Carole Sund; her daughter, Juli; their friend Silvina Pelosso; and
park guide Joie Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner pleaded guilty to Armstrong's murder and is serving a life
term. He could be executed if convicted of the other deaths.</TE>

<HD>INS Sharply Cuts Length of Tourist, Student Visa Stays</HD>
<DH>Policy: In response to the terrorist attacks, many passes would be
limited to 30 days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service, seeking to close gaps
exploited by the Sept. 11 hijackers, said Monday it will sharply reduce
the length of time many foreign students and millions of other travelers
may spend in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   INS Commissioner James W. Ziglar said his agency was seeking "the
appropriate balance" between enforcing the law and welcoming legitimate
visitors. "While we recognize the overwhelming majority who come to us as
visitors are honest and law-abiding," he said, "the events of Sept. 11
remind us there will always be those who seek to cause us harm."</LD>
<LD>   Immigration officials said many tourist visas would be slashed from
the current six months to 30 days or less, based on what INS inspectors
say is "fair and reasonable."</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the INS would immediately prohibit foreign visitors from
enrolling in U.S. schools unless they had obtained student visas. Until
now, foreign students have been allowed to begin classes in America if
their student visa applications were pending.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of INS actions follows embarrassing revelations that the
agency had notified a Florida flight school that visas were in order for
two of its students--six months after they had hijacked two jetliners and
piloted them into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   That gaffe sparked a public rebuke from President Bush and renewed
calls to overhaul the immigration service.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials plan to seek public comment on the revisions
immediately, and they expect the new rules affecting nonstudents to take
effect this summer. No congressional action is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Under the revisions, the INS would:</TE>
<TE>   * Require foreign travelers on U.S. visas to explain why they needed a
specified amount of time inside the United States. Immigration inspectors
would be directed to grant tourists 30 days if it was unclear how much
time they actually needed to accomplish the aims of their trip. The INS
also plans to reduce the maximum stay for travelers on business visas to
six months from the current 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   * Grant extensions "for unexpected or compelling humanitarian
reasons," such as medical treatment, but limit them to six months rather
than the current 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   * Demand that foreigners who intend to enroll in U.S. schools make
such plans known before entering this country with some other visa
status. Foreign visitors with nonstudent status would still be allowed to
apply for student status inside the United States, but only if they
declared that intention when they first applied to enter this country.
The INS said it would attempt to process requests to change visa status
in 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the
new rules. About 75% of foreign visitors depart within 30 days,
immigration officials said. The INS also pledged flexibility for cases
that did not involve national security, such as foreign retirees who own
vacation homes inside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The administration plan targets the complex visa system for a specific
reason--all 19 hijackers are believed to have entered the country on
legal visas approved at U.S. consulates in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.
However, the great majority of foreign visitors come from Canada, western
European nations and other countries whose citizens may enter without
visas.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Zacarias Moussaoui, the only suspect charged in the United
States in connection with the Sept. 11 hijackings, had a French passport
and did not need a visa when he entered the United States.</TE>
<TE>   And as many as 300,000 illegal immigrants are believed to enter the
United States annually through the nation's porous land borders, mostly
via Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a targeted response, rather than a heavy-handed response," said
Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a
pro-immigration group. "At least they're dealing with the issues related
to the terrorist attacks of 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   But foreign student advocates were wary. Two of the Sept. 11
hijackers, Mohamed Atta of Egypt and Marwan Al-Shehhi of the United Arab
Emirates, came to the United States on visitor visas. They enrolled in a
Florida flight school in July 2000, more than a year before the INS
approved their student visas. Such enrollments would be prohibited under
the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Another hijacker, Hani Hanjour, who helped crash another hijacked jet
into the Pentagon, had a student visa for a Bay Area English-language
school but never showed up for classes.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Johnson, public policy director at NAFSA, an association of
international educators, maintained that the nation's 550,000 foreign
students represented just 2% of temporary visa holders and that the
majority had gotten approval to study in the United States before
enrolling in school.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the political pressure that the INS is under," he said.
"But the fact is that, had the new requirements been in effect prior to
Sept. 11, they wouldn't have had any effect at all [on the terrorist
attack]. . . . Anything that focuses solely on the foreign students
doesn't get you anywhere in the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   It appeared that the change in student rules might have a significant
effect on certain types of programs, notably the intensive English
training that is often sought by foreign visitors to the United States.
Some educators expressed concern that new rules could result in a sharp
decline in the estimated 200,000 foreign students who annually enroll in
English-language programs at U.S.-based academies, colleges and
universities.</TE>
<TE>   There are no firm data, but some say language students are less likely
to apply for separate visas than foreigners seeking formal degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "If all flexibility is removed from the system, then this would have a
very serious impact on English-language programs in the States," said
Peter Thomas, who directs international programs at UC San Diego
Extension and is also president-elect of the American Assn. of Intensive
English Programs.</TE>
<TE>   Some predicted that the changes--placing greater demands on INS
staff--would overwhelm an agency already reeling from bulging backlogs.
Cutting back tourist visas from six months to 30 days, critics say, could
damage the tourist industry in places such as Southern California, where
foreign tourism is crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "The immigration service workload is going to mushroom," said Carl
Shusterman, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles and former INS
counsel. He noted that the agency began granting six-month visitors'
visas a decade ago in an effort to cut down on applications from
legitimate visitors seeking extensions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a step backwards," he said. "They're going to be buried in
extension applications."</TE>
<TE>   Among some who seek to restrict immigration, the various proposed
rules were greeted with lukewarm support. Steven A. Camarota, research
director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a restrictionist group,
approved the strategy of clamping down on the length of stay of foreign
visitors, maintaining that it has been too easy for people to live in the
United States on temporary visas.</TE>
<TE>   "These are good small steps," he said. "They're helpful. To protect
the country against terrorism we need a lot of steps, big and small."</TE>
<TE>   INS officials Monday also proposed a rule demanding that those subject
to deportation turn themselves in within 30 days of a deportation order
or sacrifice their few remaining opportunities to avoid removal.</TE>

<HD>Worried About the Rent? Charge It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having issued five credit cards for every man, woman and child in
the United States, banks are coming up with a new use for that plastic:
Charge the rent.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly a million tenants can use their cards to pay their rent, thanks
to an arrangement between Visa and the biggest U.S. property manager,
Chicago-based Apartment Investment and Management Co. Visa touts the
service as convenient for renters and landlords.</LD>
<LD>   Debt counselors, though, are aghast. They worry that putting the
monthly rent on a credit card will drive debt-ridden consumers even
further into the hole.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody in our industry in their right mind would be in favor of
this," said Dianne Wilkman, president of Springboard, a nonprofit
consumer counseling service in Riverside. "We don't advise putting the
necessities of life on credit."</TE>
<TE>   Visa's initiative began two years ago with a few renters and is
spreading nationwide. It is part of a growing effort by credit card
issuers to boost profits by encouraging consumers to use cards for
recurring transactions, such as paying utility bills, car payments and
now rent, said Robert McKinley, president of CardWeb.com, which tracks
credit card trends.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a saturated industry," McKinley said, noting that 1.4 billion
cards are in circulation. "Now the emphasis is to get consumers to use
cards for everything."</TE>
<TE>   Americans already charge three times as much as they did 10 years ago,
McKinley said. About $1.5 trillion was charged last year, compared with
$500 billion in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that increase, credit card experts say, has been driven by
Americans' lust for frequent-flier miles, a credit card perk that became
popular in the last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Airlines, for example, reported last year that its customers
had racked up 8.3 million unused miles, a 28% increase from two years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers also are charging much more than they're willing--or
able--to pay back every month. Unpaid balances on credit cards are more
than twice as high as they were in 1992: $8,367 per card-carrying
household, compared with $3,444 a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   And more consumers are falling behind in their payments, industry
statistics show, while the number of bankruptcy filings hit a record high
of 1.5 million last year.</TE>
<TE>Counselors Discourage Charging Regular Bills</TE>
<TE>   Credit counselors say charging groceries, monthly bills or rent often
is a sign a consumer is headed for credit trouble. They contend that only
consumers who pay off their accounts in full each month should consider
using credit cards to pay regular bills. Otherwise, the recurring
payments will accrue interest at rates that average 17% a year and can
easily spiral to 29%.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the idea of using plastic for monthly bills is catching
on. One of three consumers in 2000 used credit cards to make at least one
recurring monthly payment--typically for a health club membership,
Internet service or newspaper subscription, according to a MasterCard
survey.</TE>
<TE>   Convenience was the main reason, although 45% of the card users said
they benefited from lower stress, knowing the bills would be paid on
time. And 17% said they enjoyed some kind of financial reward, such as
frequent-flier miles from credit card charges or a discount on their
bills.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar amounts of recurring bills charged to credit cards are
fairly low, however. Only about 3% of MasterCard's total volume last year
was attributed to recurring payments, MasterCard spokesman Alex Lau said.</TE>
<TE>   Visa and MasterCard are trying to change that. MasterCard has been
running television ads encouraging cardholders to charge more of their
monthly expenses--phone, cable, utility, car lease and others--as a way
to simplify their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger bills mean bigger profits for Visa and MasterCard
members--typically banks and credit unions--that issue credit cards.
Issuers get about 2% of each transaction, paid by the merchant, plus any
interest charges that accumulate if consumers don't pay off their bill
each month.</TE>
<TE>Other Property Managers May Follow</TE>
<TE>   Apartment Investment and Management began accepting Visa payments at a
few of its properties almost two years ago, Visa senior sales director
Linda Brockbank said. Since then, the program has spread to all 337,000
Aimco units in 46 states--including more than a dozen in the Los Angeles
area--which house nearly a million tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Besides having their rent payment automatically charged to their
credit card each month, tenants can use their Visa credit or debit cards
to pay one-time costs, such as security deposits and application fees,
Brockbank said.</TE>
<TE>   Renters benefit by avoiding late fees, Brockbank said, and Aimco finds
its units easier to rent because tenants don't have to pay move-in costs
with cash.</TE>
<TE>   Visa won't reveal how many Aimco tenants use plastic to pay rent, but
it says a recent poll showed 40% of those who are aware of the option use
it.</TE>
<TE>   Other large property managers may follow. Archstone-Smith Trust, a
Denver-based real estate company with 80,000 units nationwide, accepts
credit cards at Studio Colony Apartments in Studio City, which it
recently acquired from a landlord who offered the service, spokeswoman
Heather Campbell said. The property manager is studying ways to take the
service nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking at ways to make it easier for people to do
business with us," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite credit counselors' concerns about the trend, Visa says it
isn't worried about adding to consumers' debt loads. Those who use credit
cards to make rent or other payments, Brockbank said, don't pay interest
on the transactions.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found the cardholders most likely to do a recurring transaction
are nonrevolvers" who pay their balances in full each month, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers also have the option of using debit cards to pay recurring
bills, she said. With a debit card, the bill is deducted directly from a
checking account, so no interest charges can accrue.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of Aimco tenants who pay their rent with a Visa use a debit
card, Brockbank said.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't satisfy credit counselors, who say consumers who use
plastic tend to spend more money than they would if they paid by check or
cash. Visa says one of the advantages of its arrangement with Aimco is
that tenants seem to be less price sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "Offering residents the automatic bill-payment option helps avoid that
moment of truth each month," Visa's news release says, "when residents
write a check and inevitably ask themselves, 'Am I paying too much for
what I'm getting? Should I look around to see if I can get a better deal
elsewhere?' "</TE>

<HD>Defiant Sharon Presses Ahead in West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Troops begin withdrawal from two cities, but Israeli
leader suggests that occupation of Palestinian territory is open-ended.

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in his strongest defiance yet
of Washington, vowed Monday to press ahead with a massive military
offensive in the West Bank. As if to underscore the point, Israeli combat
helicopters pummeled a refugee camp and ground forces took hundreds of
Palestinians prisoner.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon ignored demands from President Bush and other world leaders to
end Israel's invasion of Palestinian cities and instead expanded the
deployment of tanks throughout the West Bank countryside. In a speech to
parliament, Sharon suggested that far from withdrawal, Israel's
occupation is open-ended.</LD>
<LD>   But as pressure mounted, the Israeli army early today began pulling
troops out of two small cities, Tulkarm and Kalkilya, which had remained
relatively quiet. The White House said it was "a start."</LD>
<TE>   The army said its forces would continue to surround Tulkarm and
Kalkilya. Troops came under fire as they retreated from Tulkarm, Israeli
state radio said, but no new casualties were reported.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, fighting that had raged for
four days began to subside Monday. Scores of men--fighters and
civilians--surrendered. Inside the bloodied casbah, the old labyrinthine
center of the city, wounded lay dying at a mosque.</TE>
<TE>   In Jenin, Israeli troops, armor and helicopter gunships continued to
battle stiff resistance from lightly armed Palestinian fighters hiding in
a crowded refugee camp. Israeli and Palestinian officials estimated that
at least 100 Palestinians were killed in the last couple of days in the
camp. On Monday, two Israeli soldiers were killed and four wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian gunmen "seem to have decided to fight to the last, to make
the battle as bloody as possible," Israeli Brig. Gen. Eyal Shline said of
the Jenin operation. He said several men feigned surrender, only to blow
themselves up in suicide attacks on soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   At the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, which tradition holds is
the birthplace of Jesus, a fire erupted during a gun battle between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers. At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II said
violence in the Holy Land had escalated to "unimaginable and intolerable
levels."</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, Sharon went before a special session of the Knesset, or
Israeli parliament, to lambaste Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat and announce that he was taking his government further to the
right with the inclusion of three new right-wing ministers.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon dedicated most of his hourlong speech, during which he was
frequently heckled, to harsh criticism of Arafat. He reiterated that he
regards it as impossible to make peace with Arafat, a position that
deeply complicates this week's diplomatic mission by Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli leader said he will not call off the offensive "until the
mission has been accomplished, until Arafat's terrorist infrastructures
are uprooted" and until those fugitives who are hiding have been
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how long Sharon can so openly defy Bush.
Predicting that the prime minister would eventually have to cave in,
Israeli television Monday night featured Bush's latest comments
emphasizing his desire for Israel to pull out of the West Bank now. One
commentator said Bush was in his "angry Texas cowboy" mode.</TE>
<TE>   "I meant what I said to the prime minister of Israel. I expect there
to be withdrawal without delay," Bush heatedly told reporters on a visit
to Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   After Sharon's Knesset speech, U.S. special Mideast envoy Anthony C.
Zinni was dispatched to meet with the Israeli leader and convey the Bush
administration's displeasure. A few hours later, the army announced its
pullback from Kalkilya and Tulkarm.</TE>
<TE>   Powell told reporters after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
in Morocco that the withdrawal from the two towns was an encouraging
sign. "And I hope it is the beginning of a full withdrawal," Powell
added.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon launched Israel's biggest West Bank offensive in 35 years March
29, after a wave of suicide bombings that culminated in a Passover Seder
attack that killed 27 people, the single largest death toll in a suicide
bombing in years.</TE>
<TE>   With catcalls raining in from the left and right, Sharon told the
Knesset that when the army does withdraw, it will not be to Israel but to
buffer zones that he plans to create. The idea appalled Palestinians and
diplomats, who said it would create ghetto-like enclaves for Palestinians
and establish a de facto permanent presence by Israel in Palestinian
territory.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon said the zones would allow Israeli forces to guard against
infiltrating attackers; the plan is highly reminiscent of the former
"security zone" set up by Israel in southern Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   "In the territories under his rule, Arafat has established a regime of
terror, which nationally and officially trains terrorists and incites,
finances, arms and sends them to perpetuate murderous operations across
Israel," Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   From the podium, he displayed documents that purportedly show Arafat's
complicity in the financing of suicide bombers--listing, in one case, the
$150 it takes to supply a suicide bomber with the explosives needed to
kill. The Israeli army says it recovered a treasure trove of
incriminating documents when it overran Arafat's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Two Israeli Arab members of the Knesset were ejected from the session
after they repeatedly tried to shout down the prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a senior official in the Palestinian Authority, said
Sharon's comments signaled the formal end of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "He destroyed our way of life. He destroyed our infrastructure,"
Erekat told reporters. "They destroyed the Palestinian Authority and
dismantled the Palestinian Authority. They destroyed the peace process."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon also sought to further his campaign to supplant Arafat by
appealing to Palestinians to look to a new leader.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace can only be attained if, once we evacuate the territories, we
find a responsible Palestinian leadership, willing to accept the primary
responsibility of every regime: to prevent the use of its territory for
the purpose of killing and murdering its neighbors," he said. "Peace
negotiations can commence and move forward only after terrorism has
ceased."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was apparently forced to relent on one point. U.S. officials
were negotiating with Israeli officials for Powell to meet with Arafat
during his visit here. Sharon has tried to completely isolate the
Palestinian leader. One U.S. official said the meeting was likely.</TE>
<TE>   Critics such as Israeli opposition leader Yossi Sarid said Sharon is
fighting the day's battle without assessing the consequences. Sharon may
get rid of Arafat, Sarid said, but he's not calculating what would come
next.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no plan whatsoever for the day after," Sarid said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's appearance before the Knesset was primarily to announce the
inclusion of three additional right-wing Cabinet ministers, including
Effi Eitam, a former army commander.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Madrid, the Spanish government, which holds the rotating
leadership of the European Union, said it might convene an urgent meeting
to discuss trade sanctions on Israel if the Jewish state continued its
offensive in the West Bank.</TE>

<HD>Arafat, Oslo Accord Are Sharon's Prime Prey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The designs of Israel's vast military offensive are etched in the
dust and debris of the battered landscape here. The greatest destruction,
by far, has been visited on symbols of Palestinian self-rule.</LD>
<LD>   The sprawling if ramshackle headquarters of Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat is in ruins, its walls toppled and replaced by
barbed wire. The Palestinians' most important West Bank security
compound, an elaborate multimillion-dollar manse, was ravaged by one of
the army's most relentless aerial assaults in the current campaign. Army
raids have repeatedly targeted police who, Israel has said in the past,
were never involved in terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's offensive has been portrayed as a fight against terrorism,
and, to be sure, Israel would very much like to stop the wave of suicide
bombers and ambushing gunmen who killed 106 Israeli civilians and
soldiers last month alone. The last suicide bombing took place April 1.</LD>
<TE>   But at its core, the offensive is a systematic attempt, fathered by
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and midwifed by his military commanders, to
finish off the Palestinian Authority, any remnant of the landmark Oslo
peace process and, most important, Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   This goal--largely achieved--could put Israel and Sharon at
cross-purposes with the Bush administration as U.S. Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell begins a new diplomatic drive to avoid wider war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and the U.S. government say they still want to work with the
Palestinian Authority, which was established by the 1993 Oslo accords and
until recently had served as a key element of the framework for
Israeli-Palestinian relations.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the U.S. administration is calling on the Palestinian
leadership to rein in militants, quell violence and implement American
cease-fire proposals. Yet by so doing, it is relying on the very
structure that no longer exists: a viable Palestinian Authority that
Israel has meticulously worked to dismantle.</TE>
<TE>Sharon Not Alone in Criticizing Arafat</TE>
<TE>   What Bush and Sharon may in fact agree on is Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from his public statements, it seems that Bush, like Sharon,
may be willing to jettison Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has not missed an opportunity to criticize the Palestinian leader
as a failure who has "let his people down." Bush's national security
advisor, Condoleezza Rice, made a direct appeal to "other Palestinians"
to renounce violence, if Arafat can't.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and Israelis alike interpret this line of rhetoric as
encouragement of an alternative leadership. With characteristic but
pointed hyperbole, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, says such
talk is a "license to kill" Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon makes it clear that he has no use for Arafat, nor for the
Palestinian Authority. Sharon has repeatedly equated Arafat, his
leadership and all Palestinian militancy with terrorism that must be
wiped out. He appears eager to erase the last near-decade of history,
when Oslo was drafted and signed and when Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority were given some control over the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel is at the point of no return because Yasser Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority have no intention of respecting any accord," Sharon
said, adding that Israel will not return to "the way things were before"
it began invading the West Bank on March 29.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to destroying Arafat's headquarters, where the Palestinian
leader remains captive, Israeli tanks, armored bulldozers and combat
helicopters have torn up roads and smashed away at electricity and water
infrastructure. Troops have ransacked the Education Ministry, the
statistics bureau, most local television and radio stations, and the home
of the Palestinian information and culture minister.</TE>
<TE>   Of nearly 1,000 Palestinians arrested in Ramallah, about 30% are
people Israel regards as dangerous. But many were arrested only because
they were active in the first intifada 10 years ago; many were
businessmen, doctors and police.</TE>
<TE>Offensive Undermines Security Services</TE>
<TE>   Police, especially, were singled out for humiliating treatment. They
were forced to strip to their underwear and turn in their weapons. Once
in detention camps, they were forced to sit with their heads in a
downward position, according to other Palestinians who have been
released.</TE>
<TE>   By hitting steadily at the police forces, Sharon is undermining the
very pillars of the Palestinian Authority. Nothing more symbolizes the
autonomy of the aspiring Palestinian state than its own security
services.</TE>
<TE>   The war on the police forces culminated last week with an eight-hour
bombardment of the elegant U.S.-built headquarters of the Preventive
Security Service complex of Col. Jibril Rajoub, one of the most powerful
Palestinians in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub's police force is precisely the body that would have to enforce
a cease-fire and crackdown on terrorists. Rajoub has long maintained
close contacts with American and Israeli security officials and is seen
as a protege of the CIA. One of the few photographs on his desk before
his office was destroyed was of himself with CIA Director George J.
Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub and his new headquarters were considered untouchable. The
Israeli assault began even as U.S. officials were negotiating with Israel
and the Palestinians for a surrender of police officers and other people
inside and to spare the building. U.S. officials were stunned when
Rajoub's compound went up in smoke.</TE>
<TE>   American officials had held Rajoub up as a potential successor to
Arafat, and the attack is interpreted by many here as Sharon's
disqualification of him and any other strong leader on the Palestinian
side.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Rajoub embodied the kind of Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation enshrined in the Oslo accords. Sharon's post-Arafat vision
may not have room for such cooperation, preferring to leave security
exclusively in the hands of Israel. That in turn implies a long-term
reoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army justified the attacks on the Palestinian security
apparatus by saying it and the entire Palestinian Authority were
implicated in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a situation where we have terrorism as a separate entity
and the [Palestinian Authority] as another," said Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland,
the army's planning chief.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the military onslaught, Israeli officials are mounting
a political campaign by releasing documents that purport to tie Arafat to
the financing of suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The documents, Israeli officials say, were recovered when troops
overran Arafat's compound. In them, Arafat authorizes payments to men
suspected by Israel in bombing and shooting attacks. Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz, the Israeli army chief of staff, said the documents prove that
"the chances of reaching a peace arrangement with Arafat are
nonexistent."</TE>
<TE>A Rationale for Reoccupation</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has not described what kind of Palestinian regime he would like
to see emerge in a post-Arafat world. In several newspaper interviews, he
has spoken longingly of a pliant Palestine. Others warn that the
alternative is likely to be radical Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Destroying Palestinian security services also gives Sharon a rationale
for a more long-term reoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. If
there is no functioning police force, then only the Israeli army can
enforce security.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon aides insist that Israel does not plan a permanent presence.
But Sharon has repeatedly said he does not intend to yield very much of
the West Bank to an eventual Palestinian state, and this week his
military commanders began making the case for not withdrawing.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the territories "too soon," army operations chief Maj. Gen.
Dan Harel said, would allow a resurgence in terrorist attacks. Mofaz has
said the army needs at least two months to finish the operation.</TE>
<TE>   For all the weapons seized and all the militants killed or arrested,
many more are on hand to replace those lost. No one believes that
Palestinian resistance will truly be snuffed out, and the reoccupation of
the last 11 days has, if nothing else, left an even larger repository of
anti-Israel wrath.</TE>
<TE>   The operation in the West Bank "is a very long story," Israeli
commentator Danny Rubinstein wrote this week, "the essence of which is
the return of Israeli rule to the territories."</TE>

<HD>'I Was in This Alone'</HD>
<DH>Lori Haigh's life spiraled downward after repeated sexual abuse by
a Catholic priest in Orange County, while she says other clerics ignored
her pleas for help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lori Haigh couldn't stand the voice of Father John Lenihan any
longer. So she sat among the congregants in the parish hall and stabbed a
pencil into her left thigh again and again, until blood began to flow.</LD>
<LD>   The 16-year-old was hoping someone at St. Norbert Church in Orange
would ask her what was wrong. That's when she would blurt it all out:</LD>
<LD>   Father John was molesting me. Three, four, five times a week for the
past two years. He got me pregnant and then paid for the abortion. He set
me up with another priest.</LD>
<TE>   But no one asked.</TE>
<TE>   It took Haigh 20 years and a million-dollar lawsuit to be noticed.</TE>
<TE>   The dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange last week agreed to pay her
$1.2 million to settle her accusations against Lenihan and the church.
Though Lenihan neither admitted nor denied the allegations involving
Haigh, he previously admitted to molesting another teenage girl and
having several sexual relationships with adult women. He agreed last
month to be removed from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Tod D. Brown of Orange County last week acknowledged that Haigh
had been molested, saying, "I am deeply sorry for the hurt caused by the
actions of Father Lenihan, and extend my apology to Ms. Haigh and all
victims of sexual abuse by clergy."</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal now racking the U.S. Roman Catholic Church
has many victims. But Lori Haigh stands apart on several grounds. The
allegations that led to the settlement are among the most serious yet
leveled against a priest. And while many victims contend that
molestations haunted them for years, Haigh is among the few willing to
detail how her life spiraled downward after repeated sexual abuse, while
the church ignored her complaints.</TE>
<TE>   She is now a San Francisco mother who appears to lead an enviable life
as a video entrepreneur and songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   But she says that she hates to wear dresses because they make her feel
vulnerable--the same way she felt when Lenihan allegedly would take her
in his silver Mercury Monarch and park on deserted roads. She picks at
the skin around her fingernails, leaving them bloody, saying it distracts
her from bad thoughts. She says she has tried to commit suicide more than
10 times, beginning at 16, when Lenihan allegedly got her pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh grew up in a devoutly Catholic family. Her parents, Jane and
Faust Capobianco, sent her to parochial school near their home in Villa
Park, an affluent community in Orange County. The family attended Mass
each Sunday at the Holy Family Cathedral in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh played the guitar along with two nuns at her school, a talent
that caught the eye of a 32-year-old priest from Ireland, Father Lenihan.
He asked the 14-year-old to be part of the band at his "rock 'n' roll"
Mass on Sunday evenings at St. Norbert Church in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed a big interest in me," she said. "I felt special, like I
was selected out of the crowd to be his confidant."</TE>
<TE>   She was too young to drive, so Lenihan volunteered to pick her up at
her home. Her parents said they were happy that a popular priest had
taken an interest in their daughter's life.</TE>
<TE>   "You look to them for guidance," said her father, a retired doctor now
living in Tennessee. "You value the association."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said Lenihan almost immediately began hugging and kissing her in
the car.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never kissed a boy before," she said. "It seemed like a safe
situation. I knew he would never tell." And she did not imagine it would
go further.</TE>
<TE>   But it did, first to oral sex, then intercourse. Haigh said the
molestations continued regularly until she was 17.</TE>
<TE>   She said she didn't make him stop because, in some ways, he was her
first love. He also gave her freedom: He had a car, and she could stay
out late with him.</TE>
<TE>Giving Signs That She Needed Help</TE>
<TE>   Haigh's parents didn't particularly like her friends from Villa Park
High School, where she had recently transferred, so they encouraged her
involvement with the parish and Father John.</TE>
<TE>   Classmate Andrea Lamacki once watched Lenihan stare at Haigh from the
rectory window and run out into the church parking lot to give her an
expensive harmonica.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember thinking that was odd, it wasn't right," Lamacki said.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh started to give signs--both subtle and obvious--that she needed
help. Her grades, normally A's, plummeted. She ditched classes. She wore
an asymmetrical punk haircut and "Dead Kennedys" T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Another classmate, Shannon Moser, remembers Haigh in tears, talking on
the phone in a mutual friend's bedroom. When Moser asked another friend
what was wrong, she was told that Father John had gotten Haigh pregnant
and was telling her to get an abortion. Moser didn't believe the story
until Haigh held up the phone and she recognized Lenihan's distinctive
Irish brogue.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh went to a Planned Parenthood clinic for the abortion.</TE>
<TE>   She began to tell some adults about her relationship with Lenihan: the
psychiatrist that her parents sent her to when her grades began to fall,
and the abortion counselor at Planned Parenthood. Neither told her
parents, though the psychiatrist--bound by doctor-patient
confidentiality--did tell her parents to keep her away from the church
and Father John. Haigh said her parents took the warning as anti-Catholic
sentiment. It's unclear why the psychiatrist, now retired and unavailable
for comment, didn't report the incidents to law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "[At Planned Parenthood,] the counselor asked me how the father felt
about the abortion, and I said, 'Well, he's my Catholic priest.' I don't
know if she believed me or not, but she just kept on going," Haigh said.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan also told her he wanted her to meet a fellow priest and
schoolmate from Ireland who had recently arrived, Haigh said. The priest,
whose name Haigh could not remember, took her to dinner at a coffee shop.
Afterward, she said, he tried to sexually attack her in his car.</TE>
<TE>   She finds it hard to explain why she couldn't tell her parents. She
rattles off some possibilities: She was afraid of getting Lenihan in
trouble. She thought somehow she was doing a good deed for the church by
providing Lenihan a sexual release. She thought "the needs of many
outweighed the needs of me."</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants to be the one to get this spiritual icon in trouble?" she
asked.</TE>
<TE>'I Realized Then That I Was in This Alone'</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Haigh said, she decided to tell another priest. She said she
went to Father Lawrence J. Baird, a priest she said was revered by her
family. Now a monsignor and diocesan spokesman, Baird was in residence at
the Holy Family Cathedral in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she told Baird about her relationship with Lenihan and he
responded by kissing her and rubbing himself against her. She said she
pushed him away.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Baird adamantly denied the allegation, and threatened to
file a defamation lawsuit against Haigh if she does not recant.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she also met with Father John Urell, another priest at the
cathedral. Urell is now a monsignor and vicar general, the third-
highest-ranking priest in the Diocese of Orange. She alleges that Urell
called her a liar and told to stay away from the church.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said her meeting with Urell did more lasting emotional damage to
her than the four years of alleged abuse by Lenihan.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like it took so much courage to finally go to the church," she
said. "I wanted at least to be absolved by a priest for my part in it."</TE>
<TE>   Urell also has denied meeting Haigh.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual relationship finally ended when Lenihan told her that he
would deny it all if word leaked out.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he would [face] consequences for what he had done," she
said. "I realized then that I was in this alone."</TE>
<TE>   She barely graduated from high school in 1982 and started classes at
Orange Coast College. She eventually landed a job with a Beverly Hills
public relations firm. Among her duties were hosting parties for rock
stars. She said she "self-medicated" with drugs and alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "My career and everything was really good, but I still felt horrible
inside," she said. "I didn't believe in God."</TE>
<TE>   Her roommate was writing a screenplay based loosely upon her
relationship with Lenihan, and Haigh said she wanted to kill herself so
the priest would have "my blood on his conscience." That would give her
roommate the perfect ending for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Haigh decided to start a new life in Nashville, where she did
publicity for Christian music artists and began a video production
business. She married a Hare Krishna, explored that religion and had a
son. "Eastern religion was as far away as I could get from Catholicism,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she occasionally would get into her car, leave her seat
belt unfastened and race down the country roads near Nashville. She
crashed several times times and totaled a Jeep Cherokee. She hoped she
would die.</TE>
<TE>   "But I kept walking away," she said with laugh.</TE>
<TE>Haunted by the Past in San Francisco</TE>
<TE>   Haigh divorced in 1991, and a few years later met her current husband
in London while she was on a movie shoot. She moved with him and her son
to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   There, she shoots corporate and music videos, creates multimedia
content for Web sites and has a weekly cable access show. She has another
child, a 2-year-old boy. She's fixing up a four-story home she bought in
the Twin Peaks area of San Francisco,</TE>
<TE>   She has a music studio in the basement where she writes and plays her
folk rock songs. On Monday night, she's often at the Hotel Utah, playing
her guitar to small crowds on "open mike" night.</TE>
<TE>   And when I wake he will be gone</TE>
<TE>   And I won't see him until the classroom</TE>
<TE>   It's just a tale of right and wrong</TE>
<TE>   That they will whisper inside the bathroom</TE>
<TE>   How she lost the game</TE>
<TE>   She'll never be the same</TE>
<TE>   Her hidden life is still with her. She says her second marriage is in
trouble, for a variety of reasons. Aside from her children, she says she
has problems with intimacy of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't seem to have normal relationships with anyone," she said,
"and I don't think I ever will. I just don't want to inflict myself on
other people."</TE>
<TE>   In the Mission district, she worked next door to Dennis Hodges'
carpentry business for a full year until she even said hello.</TE>
<TE>   "She holds everyone at arm's length," said Hodges, who's become a
friend. "I just see the surface."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I look at the path I was on--cheerleader, Polo shirts,
preppy--and the whole life I had ahead of me, and I feel like I've been
tarnished and shunned by God," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She filed the lawsuit in December, prompted by Lenihan's confessions
about his previous relationships to Times columnist Steve Lopez. She was
angry, she said, that he admitted to only one molestation of a minor and
not to his alleged transgressions with her. On Monday last week, Haigh
attended a press conference called by Baird to deny her charges. Diocesan
officials and parishioners have rallied around Baird, and Auxiliary
Bishop Jaime Soto stood next to him as he described Haigh's accusation as
"absolutely without foundation."</TE>
<TE>   "I state unequivocally that I have no awareness of ever having met or
spoken with this person in my life and have absolutely no idea who Miss
Haigh is," Baird said. "I have 100% memory that I have never made any
inappropriate contact with any person during my 33 years as a priest. No
one has ever made such a charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea what motivates her to make such an insidious
allegation." Baird turned to Haigh and said, "I pray for you."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she felt devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "I got this settlement, but they are still calling me a liar," she
said. "That's the whole reason why I filed the lawsuit in the first
place."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Dominates Pulitzers as N.Y. Times Wins Record 7</HD>
<DH>Media: The Los Angeles Times receives two, for feature and
editorial writing. The Washington Post also nets two.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks and their aftermath
dominating the awards, the New York Times won a record seven Pulitzer
Prizes on Monday. The Los Angeles Times and Washington Post received two
each.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the 14 Pulitzers announced by the Graduate School of
Journalism at Columbia University in New York were given for stories and
photos related to the attacks and the resulting war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Times won six of those, including the most coveted of the
Pulitzers, the gold medal for public service. That prize was awarded for
the newspaper's special stand-alone section, "A Nation Challenged,"
published daily for almost four months after Sept. 11. It included more
than 1,800 "Portraits of Grief," brief character sketches of people
killed that day.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Siegel of the Los Angeles Times won the prize for feature
writing for what the board called a "humane and haunting portrait"--a
soul-searching journey with a popular and highly respected Utah judge who
agonized over what he could have done to prevent both his father's
suicide and, 20 years later, the suicide of Paul Wayment. The judge had
sentenced Wayment to 30 days in prison for negligence in the death of his
2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Raksin and Bob Sipchen of The Los Angeles Times won the Pulitzer
Prize for editorial writing for "comprehensive and powerfully written"
pieces that prompted both the city of Los Angeles and the state of
California to take a more active role in the treatment and protection of
chronically mentally ill "street people."</TE>
<TE>   This year's prizes raise the Los Angeles Times' total to 27.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Times, which has now won 88 Pulitzers, more than any
other news organization, also won for international reporting, beat
reporting, explanatory journalism, feature photography, news photography
and commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record for Pulitzers in one year was three--a mark
achieved four times by the New York Times, twice by the Washington Post
and once each by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Boston Globe.</TE>
<TE>   Each Pulitzer, except for the public service award, carries with it a
$7,500 cash prize.</TE>
<TE>   Among the seven Pulitzers won by the New York Times, the commentary
prize was especially notable because it was the third Pulitzer for
columnist Thomas L. Friedman, 48, who previously won in 1983 and 1988 for
international reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman, honored this time for "his clarity of vision, based on
extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the
terrorist threat," said this Pulitzer was particularly satisfying because
"this is the biggest story of my lifetime, and if we in the media don't
get it right, don't explain it right, it won't be good for the future of
our kids and the future of our country."</TE>
<TE>   The only other three-time individual winners since the Pulitzers began
in 1917 are four cartoonists and correspondent/columnist Arthur Krock of
the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers traditionally celebrate their Pulitzers with champagne in
the newsroom, and at the Los Angeles Times champagne ceremony following
Monday's announcement, John Carroll, The Times' editor, praised Siegel as
someone who has "practiced his craft with skill and devotion for many
years." Carroll also drew applause and laughter when he praised "a
supporting cast about the size of a Cecil B. DeMille production" for
having helped with the editing and production of Siegel's 6,000-word
article.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll named 14 editors, designers and photographers, and he and
Siegel especially singled out Richard E. Meyer, Siegel's editor and a
two-time Pulitzer finalist himself.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, 52, a Times reporter since 1976, said he was "greatly
indebted" to Meyer, not only for his editing but for his "passion and
sense of narrative."</TE>
<TE>   Siegel said his story was about "moral choices and their consequences"
and said he was particularly fortunate that Judge Robert Hilder in Silver
Summit, Utah, "a remarkable man . . . opened up to me and made this story
a writer's dream."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said The Times' prize-winning editorials were noteworthy
because "they were not ivory tower productions. Alex and Bob went to the
worst parts of the city . . . and combined sheer reporting with clarity
of thought to produce them.</TE>
<TE>   Raksin, 41, and Sipchen, 48, both with The Times since the mid-1980s,
visited the alleys and freeway underpasses, shelters and halfway houses
to talk to their subjects, and they also interviewed police officers,
judges and social service workers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the most conspicuous problems our country faces, and
it's shameful that we haven't solved it yet," Sipchen said. "These
editorials came from our hearts, and I think that's why they were
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Raksin acknowledged that while the problem remains, "we tried in our
editorials to bust the orthodoxy that it can't be--that people can't be
helped off the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post, which now has won 37 Pulitzers, received this
year's prizes for investigative reporting and national reporting.</TE>
<TE>   The Post's prize-winning investigative stories were written by Sari
Horwitz and Scott Higham, with the assistance of Sarah Cohen, the paper's
database editor. They exposed the District of Columbia's role in the
neglect and deaths of 229 children placed in its protective care from
1993 to 2000 and prompted an overhaul of the district's child welfare
system.</TE>
<TE>   The Post has been writing about this for more than two years, and "in
the face of the city completely stonewalling us, it took much very, very
hard work," said Leonard Downie Jr., the paper's executive editor.</TE>
<TE>   These stories were originally entered in both the investigative and
public service categories, a not-uncommon practice. But the Pulitzers are
awarded in a two-tier process, with three finalists chosen in each
category by individual juries of five to seven journalists for each. Then
the 17-person board that oversees the prizes and has ultimate authority
over them makes the final decisions for all categories, sometimes
overruling the juries.</TE>
<TE>   The Post series was not judged one of the three best by the jury in
the investigative category, but it was nominated as a finalist by the
public service jury. The board shifted the stories to the investigative
reporting category, thus eliminating the three finalists selected by the
jury in that category.</TE>
<TE>   One of those finalists was a series of stories in the Seattle Times on
the deaths of several patients at a cancer research center in Seattle and
the failure of doctors there to adequately inform the patients of the
risks of their treatment.</TE>
<TE>   That series triggered considerable controversy in the journalistic
community after the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed column and an
editorial last month attacking the series as unfair and inaccurate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's regrettable . . . and unfortunate that the Wall Street Journal
entered the fray that way," Michael Fancher, executive editor of the
Seattle Times, said Monday, "but the Washington Post entry was an
excellent piece of journalism, and while there's no way for me to know if
the Journal had any effect, I think the [Pulitzer] board knows how to
sort that stuff out."</TE>
<TE>   Seymour Topping, the prize administrator, said the board did note the
criticisms of the Seattle series, by various sources, but its final
decision "had nothing to do with any of the complaints that were lodged."</TE>
<TE>   The Post's other Pulitzer went to its staff, in national reporting,
for "comprehensive coverage of America's war on terrorism." These
stories, the Pulitzer Board said, "regularly brought forth new
information" and provided "skilled analysis of unfolding developments."</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal won the award for breaking news, a tribute to
its "comprehensive and insightful coverage, executed under the most
difficult circumstances, of the terrorist attacks on New York City, which
recounted the day's events and their implications for the future."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks on the World Trade Center, diagonally across the street
from the Journal offices, forced the staff to evacuate its badly damaged
offices and produce the next day's paper from a plant in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The Journal celebration was somewhat subdued, in part because staffer
Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and killed in Pakistan while covering
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other New York Times prizes were those for Barry Bearak, in
the international reporting category, for his "deeply affecting and
illuminating coverage" of daily life in war-torn Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan is at once the most beautiful country on the planet and
also the most unfortunate," Bearak said, "a desperate place, a sad
place."</TE>
<TE>   Several newsroom celebrants made similar comments, and during the New
York Times ceremony, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher, called for a
moment of silence for those killed on Sept. 11 and in the war in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Howell Raines, executive editor of the Times, said, "We're
tremendously gratified by the awards and proud of the journalistic
accomplishment, but we're ever-mindful that this journalism was about
shattering events for our city and our country and the world community,
and that helps keep all this in the proper perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Raines told his staff they're "the greatest in the world" and said
that while he generally tries to avoid superlatives, he wanted to quote
"Mississippi's greatest moral philosopher, Dizzy Dean [the former
baseball star], who said, 'It ain't bragging if you really done it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Raines took over editorial leadership of the Times five days before
Sept. 11, and he made a point Monday of thanking his predecessor, Joseph
Lelyveld, for "starting us down the path" to Monday's awards.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the Pulitzer board has taken special pleasure in
recognizing the work of smaller newspapers. But this year, 12 of the 14
prizes went to the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and
Wall Street Journal, and there were no small-town winners.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that is attributable to the events of Sept. 11. No other event
has so dominated the prizes in their 85-year history. But as John Carroll
said during the Los Angeles Times Pulitzer celebration, while this year's
prizes are good for the winning papers, they add up to "a bad thing for
American journalism."</TE>
<TE>   "It tells us much about the gap between the elite press and the
non-elite press," he said.</TE>

<HD>Drug Tests for Entire School Weighed</HD>
<DH>Education: Convinced of a serious problem, rural district may take
gamble that could bring suits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALTURAS, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Seab McDonald doesn't care what outsiders think: He's convinced
there's a dangerous teenage drug problem in this folksy, far-removed
corner of Northern California. And the gray-haired community patriarch
wants to put a stop to it now.</LD>
<LD>   So McDonald and other members of the Modoc Joint Unified School
District Board of Trustees are leaning toward taking a gamble they know
could bring them unwanted notoriety and even lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   With the U.S. Supreme Court signaling it may soon let public schools
expand drug testing beyond student athletes to include those involved in
any after-school activity, Modoc officials will vote today on whether to
go one step further: to test all of its 300 high school students,
regardless of whether they are suspected of using drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Few, if any, schools nationwide now test on such a broad scale,
experts say. Those that tried backed off after legal challenges that they
were violating students' rights.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonald isn't afraid to take his place on the academic front
lines of America's debate over illicit drug use among teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't think this community has a serious drug problem, well
then you've got your head in the sand," said McDonald, board president
and owner of the True Value hardware store on Main Street. "Forget
terrorists. Drugs are this country's biggest enemy. We've got to do
something."</TE>
<TE>   The plan has divided this remote ranching town of 2,900 residents
between those who think "suspicionless" testing is a small price to pay
and those who decry it as a government Gestapo tactic. Students complain
that the entire debate demonstrates how little adults trust them to do
what's right.</TE>
<TE>   Even local education officials are publicly second-guessing the school
board. Said district Supt. Kevin Jolly: "I don't want to live in a
country where I can be searched without grounds just because someone
suddenly decides it's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Modoc plunged into its drug-use debate in November, when resident
Angel Williams learned what she calls the truth about teenage life in
Alturas, the county seat.</TE>
<TE>   Her oldest son, Justin, a starting point guard for the Modoc High
School Braves, confessed to his parents that he had been smoking pot for
the last two years. But as Justin and his mother sat outside the school
in their station wagon, waiting to pick up another of the family's three
boys, the 17-year-old senior suddenly began pointing to fellow students
filing out after classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of the blue, he began fingering different kids, saying, 'I smoked
pot with that one. I bought from that one,' " Williams recalled. "It was
almost every student who passed by. He said, 'Mom, you'd be surprised how
many kids get high around here.' I was just baffled. I thought, 'This
can't be happening. Not in this small town. . . .' "</TE>
<TE>   Williams telephoned McDonald to demand an investigation. But as
officials decided what to do, other incidents unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Over the winter months, several members of Modoc High's wrestling and
basketball teams were found using and selling drugs--students who
officials considered respectable role models. And last month, three Modoc
High students--one the stepdaughter of a veteran Alturas police
officer--were arrested after they cut class and were caught smoking pot
in a car parked just outside town.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Larry Pickett, who five years ago arrested his own
stepdaughter for marijuana use while she attended Modoc High, said the
Alturas drug problem is serious.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are using drugs left and right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Pickett said, he has seen not only marijuana use but
methamphetamine and cocaine use as well. "This really concerns me," he
said. "We don't know where this is leading."</TE>
<TE>9,500 Residents in County</TE>
<TE>   Bordering Oregon and Nevada, Modoc County is so secluded, school
officials say, that it has become a frequent home for families involved
in the federal government's witness protection program.</TE>
<TE>   With 4,500 square miles--an area larger than Los Angeles County--Modoc
County is home to a mere 9,500 residents-- and just one four-way
stoplight. After Alturas, the next biggest town--100 miles away--has 300
people. Consisting of 70% federal and state forest land, the county has
no malls, no commercial flight service and one weekly newspaper. It was
the only one of California's 58 counties to lose population in the last
census.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, student drug use has been gradually rising in
recent years, according to a University of Michigan study. But the trend
has grown faster in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Drug use among Modoc County teenagers seems typical of other small
places, experts say. In a 1998 survey of 712 county kindergarten through
12th-grade students, 28% admitted using marijuana at least once in the
previous year. Six percent said they had used methamphetamine at least
one time.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Modoc's numbers fit national averages is immaterial, local
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have more of a drug problem than the community down the road
or less of one--that really doesn't matter to us," said Supt. Jolly.
"Whatever it is, we think our problem needs addressing. The question is
how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Students call the plan an over-reaction, saying their own drug-use
survey found that less than 10% of students had ever come to school under
the influence.</TE>
<TE>   It was in 1998 that Angel Williams and her husband moved to Alturas
from Dallas to help their sons escape big city bad habits.</TE>
<TE>   They opened a Texaco station, with the boys helping out on nights and
weekends. But then Justin seemed to change. He stopped work at the
station and spent time in his room or at a friend's house.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't socialize with us--we were suddenly taboo," his mother
said. "We figured a burg like this would be problem-free. Boy, were we
delusional."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said she heartily supports random testing of every Modoc High
student.</TE>
<TE>   At the Main Street coffee shop, opinions about the town's teenagers
come fast and furious.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think these students ought to be trusted--they're just kids,"
said Shirley Clay. "If they don't do drugs, then they've got nothing to
worry about."</TE>
<TE>   Rancher John Gilstrap agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids always give you a lot of lip about things you tell them to do
and then come back years later and tell you it wasn't so bad after all,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Local teenagers blame their disaffection on plain restlessness.</TE>
<TE>   Alturas has no video arcade or even a bowling alley, and the
single-screen Niles Theater only opens on weekends. The result: There's
not much else to do for fun other than get high, some children say.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bored out of my mind when I was in high school here," said
Alturas waitress Kati Snavely, now 22. "After school, my friends came to
my house and we watched movies and got stoned. And I still managed to be
an honor student."</TE>
<TE>   Carrie Anderson, who taught school here for 37 years, has an answer to
that: "We know we're isolated hicks from the sticks and we wouldn't want
it any other way. My husband used to say, 'If these kids are bored,
there's a nice library right here in town. . . .' "</TE>
<TE>   Recently, 170 people packed a school board meeting to protest the
drug-testing plan. Many said the tests would cost money that would take
away from academic expenses. Others complained that the plan violates
their 4th Amendment right against unlawful search and seizure.</TE>
<TE>Court Ruling Expected</TE>
<TE>   Dismissing the uproar, McDonald claims he is supported by the town's
"silent majority."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize the 4th Amendment gives kids the right to do illegal
things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the testing of high school
athletes based on a case in Oregon. Since 1998, 5% of schools nationwide
have performed drug tests on student athletes and an additional 2% on
students enrolled in other after-school activities, studies show.</TE>
<TE>   The case now before the high court involves an Oklahoma high school
that tested all students who took part in after-school activities. A
student in the school choir filed suit, complaining that the test
constituted an unreasonable search. But in oral arguments last month, the
justices seemed to side with the school and signaled they might even
approve wider testing. A ruling is expected this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Modoc High's current policy allows for drug testing only when
officials have cause to suspect a student. Under the new proposal, every
student would be tested at the start of the school year. After that, 10
would be randomly selected each month for retesting. Those with positive
results would receive counseling, their parents would be notified and, if
problems continued, they would lose privileges to after-school programs.
They would not be subject to arrest, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Modoc Joint Unified School District board--whose members include a
truck driver, teacher and retired beer distributor--is leaning 3 to 2 in
favor of school-wide testing, with McDonald being the plan's most vocal
proponent, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, urge caution.</TE>
<TE>   Until the courts legalize such broad-based tests, approving the plan
will place them in "unexplored territory" and leave them open to
lawsuits, some officials say. Said Modoc High Principal John Nickel:
"It's not the kind of notoriety our school is looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Activists warn that they will sue schools that try to test all
students.</TE>
<TE>   "This invades people's privacy in just about every way you can think
of," said Ann Brick, an ACLU attorney in San Francisco. "Students may be
taking birth control pills, which they can legally do without parental
consent, or be on depression medication--all extremely personal
information they'd have to divulge in a drug test."</TE>
<TE>   Modoc High graduate Snavely said parents are two-faced to point
fingers at their children. "Everybody's an alcoholic in this town," she
said. "But they preach to us about drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Officials acknowledge that Alturas has endured a wild past. A former
railroad and logging center, the town once had 17 bars and just two
churches--and got nationwide attention as America's per-capita leader in
the consumption of Early Times bourbon.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, Alturas has only a handful of bars and 18 churches, yet runs
two Alcoholics Anonymous programs.</TE>
<TE>Other Efforts Cited</TE>
<TE>   McDonald growled after one student suggested that the entire town take
drug and alcohol tests. "That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever
heard," he said. "But if they want, I'll be the first to take the test."</TE>
<TE>   To support his plan, McDonald points to similar measures elsewhere,
like the Florida private academy that administers Breathalyzer tests at
dances and the Texas public school that tested students and teachers
before a local judge ruled the practice was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "Those tests worked," said Raymond Lusk, superintendent of schools in
Lockney, Texas. "After we started, drug use stopped cold."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald said it's time the adults in Alturas take charge of their
community.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids didn't have rights until they turned 18--I had control," said
the 59-year-old, whose two grown daughters attended Modoc High. "When
you're 21, OK. Until then, go to court and get emancipated if you want
freedom."</TE>
<TE>   As he sits in his cramped hardware store office, McDonald's voice
chokes as he divulges another motivation behind his plan. One of his
daughters suffers a drug habit that he acknowledges began at Modoc High,
right under her father's nose.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to God she's clean now," McDonald said, sobbing. "When she was
in high school, she hid the signs from me. I didn't know. But I see the
same signs in these kids today and it just hits too close to home."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Navy Can Use Port of Aden Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>The United States and Yemen have reached a deal to allow U.S.
warships to resume refueling in the Yemeni port where the destroyer Cole
was attacked nearly 18 months ago, officials from both countries said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the accord, officials said, U.S. Marines will participate in
security at the port of Aden, where 17 American sailors were killed and
37 hurt when a small boat, laden with explosives, was detonated beside
the Cole in October 2000.</LD>
<LD>   However, both Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Richard B. Myers said Monday that they did not know
of any plans to resume using Aden as a refueling stop, and it was not
clear when refueling would resume.</LD>
<TE>   "There are no current plans that I know of with respect to Aden,"
Rumsfeld told a Pentagon news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The port is strategically located near the Arabian Sea, the Indian
Ocean and important shipping lanes. Anthony C. Zinni, the special U.S.
Mideast envoy, said after the attack that Aden remained the region's
least dangerous refueling point.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. suspects Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network was
behind the Cole attack. Yemen has been unable to arrest key Al Qaeda
suspects and acknowledges that there may be other Al Qaeda activists in
the country.</TE>
<TE>   For Yemen, the return of U.S. warships to its main port is seen as a
vote of confidence in the country's leadership and an opportunity to make
money.</TE>
<TE>   "Their return will yield us huge returns of foreign currency because
we will supply the ships with fuel, water, food supplies and will charge
them for those services as well as docking facilities," a Yemeni official
said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Yemen has committed itself to the U.S. war on terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Five Killed, 64 Injured in Jalalabad Bombing</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Explosion at a crowded market appears to have been an
attempt to kill the defense minister.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JALALABAD, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>In what appeared to be an assassination attempt against
Afghanistan's defense minister, a fiery bomb exploded Monday in a
lunchtime market packed with flag-waving schoolchildren dispatched to
greet the official.</LD>
<LD>   At least five people were killed, including two children and a teenage
boy, and 64 people were injured. The bomb missed the heavily armed convoy
of Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim by just 200 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Tensions had been high in this eastern provincial capital because of
opposition to a government crackdown on opium poppy cultivation and
simmering hostility toward Fahim, an ethnic Tajik deeply resented by
Pushtuns who dominate the region. In the last two nights, unsigned
posters have appeared, warning that anyone supporting the government
risks death and that "killing government officials is legitimate."</LD>
<TE>   In an attempt to build crowds for Fahim, teachers emptied classrooms.
"We were told everyone should come out to the streets and bring flags and
flowers," said 8-year-old Abdul Wahab. "Our teachers told us that if we
didn't show up we would be counted five days absent."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing came just days after the interim government rounded up
about 300 members of the Hezb-i-Islami political party, most of them
Pushtuns, on charges of plotting to overthrow the government.
Hezb-i-Islami officials described the arrests as an anti-Pushtun campaign
by ethnic Tajik ministers. About 160 people remain in custody.</TE>
<TE>   The ethnic conflict added a new layer of fear and anxiety to a country
already on edge because of armed factions jockeying for position ahead of
a national assembly scheduled in June.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Sunday night, Haji Mohammed Zaman, the regional
security chief, had dismissed security concerns with a wave of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   That same evening, Zaman's officers tried and failed to organize
soldiers in ill-fitting uniforms into a coherent formation during a dress
rehearsal for the defense minister's visit. Their poor training was
evident in the moments after the bomb exploded, when attempts to turn
around the convoy of dignitaries produced gridlock as victims lay
bleeding and dying.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles bumped back and forth for several minutes before security
officials finally drove Fahim, dressed in a brown business suit and tie,
to a military base outside Jalalabad. He delivered a scheduled two-hour
speech on ethnic unity, then returned to the capital, Kabul, by
helicopter a day earlier than planned.</TE>
<TE>   "They killed civilians and students who were there in the spirit of
happiness, and they made it into a sad occasion," Fahim said. "The attack
was meant not only to kill me. They wanted to cause a disruption and send
a message."</TE>
<TE>   Haji Abdul Qadir, the governor of Nangarhar province, said: "This is
the work of criminals. We will catch them in a few days."</TE>
<TE>   No group claimed responsibility for the attack. The appearance of the
Pushtun-language posters, which denounced the interim government as a
cabal of "non-Muslim" traitors conspiring with the United States and
Britain, suggested continuing underground support for the
Pushtun-dominated Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahim, a Nangarhar provincial security officer who witnessed the
explosion, called the bombing at the Chauk Talashi market an
assassination attempt against Fahim and local political and military
officials, who were part of the convoy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious the convoy was the target, and they just missed," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion splattered snack shops and fruit carts with blood. A row
of shops was burned and buckled, and the Afghan flags strung for the
occasion were left shredded. The shoes and hats and tattered robes of the
victims were lined up neatly in the dust, awaiting the arrival of
relatives to claim them.</TE>
<TE>   Security officers at the scene said Fahim was scheduled to stop at the
market at noon to visit the construction site of an underground shopping
arcade, the first government project since the Taliban was driven from
the city in November.</TE>
<TE>   It was not known whether the bomb, which exploded at noon, was
triggered by a timing device or remote control. Soldiers said it had been
hidden beneath a diesel-powered generator and attached to the generator's
battery. Generators are common in Afghan cities, where the electrical
supply is spotty.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just telling the shopkeepers to close up because the motorcade
was coming--and boom!--the generator went flying and bodies were
everywhere," said Noor Agah, a soldier who said he escaped injury because
he was standing behind a tree.</TE>
<TE>   "I picked up a body and the arm came off," Agah said. "He was dead.
Then I saw a body that was only pieces of a person."</TE>
<TE>   One of the victims was 15-year-old Haroon Gul, who worked in one of
the open-front restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just working there selling cakes and pastries," said his
mother, Saima Gul, wailing in grief.</TE>
<TE>Area Poppy Growers Angry Over Crackdown</TE>
<TE>   Fahim and other officials from Kabul arrived Monday morning in
Jalalabad, Afghanistan's gateway to the Khyber Pass and Pakistan, to meet
with regional leaders who, like Fahim, were part of the Northern Alliance
coalition that defeated the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim arrived just four days after the government announced a plan to
outlaw opium poppy cultivation. Nangarhar is the country's second-leading
opium producer and the source of its highest-grade opium. Poppy farmers
have threatened violence if the government attempts to destroy their
crops, which are due to be harvested in a week or so.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers between Jalalabad and the Khyber Pass reported that the road
was blocked in several places by angry growers who stoned passing cars.
An international aid worker said he was forced to turn back to Jalalabad.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers under the control of Zaman and Hazrat Ali, the regional corps
commander, are nominally under the command of Fahim. They would be needed
for any attempts to plow under, burn or chop down farmers' poppy crops.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing sent ripples of fear through Jalalabad. Parents whisked
their children from the streets. Shopkeepers rolled down their stores'
metal shutters and hurried home.</TE>
<TE>   Gunmen loyal to commanders Zaman and Ali careened through the streets
in pickup trucks, horns blaring. Normally armed with only automatic
rifles and sidearms, they brandished grenade launchers and antitank
weapons immediately after the bombing.</TE>
<TE>Anxious Relatives Swarm Hospital</TE>
<TE>   At Sehate Ama hospital, a crowd of men and boys punched and shoved one
another as they struggled to read a handwritten roster of the dead and
wounded that had been posted on a pharmacy wall. Finally a man began to
shout out the names of the wounded: "Ali Ahmad, 6 years old, son of Nazir
Gul, serious condition . . . " and there were gasps.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the afternoon, Ali, the corps commander, visited the wounded.
He promised the family of each victim $100 but did not say where the
money would come from, according to Hash Matullah, who was visiting a
cousin wounded in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Amin Ullah, a nurse, said 20 of the wounded were in critical
condition. He stood outside the operating theater, his green scrubs
flecked with blood. "They're working on one of them now. I don't think
he's going to make it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a grimy room just off the main corridor, five men lay on gurneys,
their heads and limbs wrapped in gauze and IV tubes strapped to their
arms. They stared up at the windows, where the desperate faces of men and
boys peered in from outside in search of loved ones, their heads casting
dark shadows in the brilliant spring sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Zargai, 26, a spindly vegetable cart vendor whose legs were
cut and burned, said he had decided to go home at noon because soldiers
had ordered him to shut down his cart in anticipation of Fahim's arrival.
"I was just starting to walk across the street when the bomb went off,
and I was knocked to the ground," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Akim Khan, 25, lay with both legs bloodied and bandaged. He said he
had arrived here Sunday from the Pakistani border city of Peshawar to
visit a friend. He was walking to the friend's house through the square
when the bomb exploded, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I got blown into the street, and then I woke up and a taxi driver was
pulling me into his taxi," Khan said. "God was with me today."</TE>

<HD>For Mexico Nonprofit, It's Garbage In, Handbags Out</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Ecology group turns refuse into fashion to show how
to recycle and also provide trash pickers with jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>In a run-down apartment complex, the head of a tiny nonprofit
organization sews messenger bags, slick evening purses and trendy
satchels bound for the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The products are more than fashion statements. They are a statement
about how Mexico should handle its garbage.</LD>
<LD>   BIO, a 12-year-old environment advocacy group here, makes the slick
and sturdy black bags from inner tubes taken out of damaged truck tires
in Mexico City. The activists want to show that materials can be recycled
into useful, even beautiful, objects.</LD>
<TE>   BIO also hopes the bag business--called Vulcania, a play on a Spanish
word for tire shops--can grow big enough to provide jobs for some of
Mexico City's poorest families, including those who live and work in the
city's garbage dumps.</TE>
<TE>   "These are real quality bags that may be of appeal to a wide variety
of people. Greens will like them. Punks who like black will like them.
Messengers and other workers who need rough-and-tumble bags want them,"
said BIO leader Arturo Buenrostro. "At the same time, we can create
better work conditions for people."</TE>
<TE>Those Living Off Dumps Lack Utilities, Get Sick</TE>
<TE>   The garbage pickers, or pepenadores, are well known in Mexico and
other Latin American countries. They live in the dumps without running
water and little electricity and often suffer from diseases, according to
researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Making only a few dollars a day, they dig through the stinking mounds
for glass, rags, copper and other metals, plastics and electrical
appliances, even those that don't work.</TE>
<TE>   Buenrostro believes the pepenadores are exploited by their employers.
The bosses receive money from both private companies dumping in the
city-owned landfill and from the pickers, who pay small amounts to sell
what they collect.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end," he said, "the pepenadores don't know that there are
other ways to live, to make money."</TE>
<TE>   Buenrostro believes private companies should handle the trash and
charge residents by the can so they are encouraged to recycle. Additional
recycling should be handled by gloved, salaried employees, not bands of
ragtag pickers living in substandard conditions, he argues.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, unionized city employees collect the trash in Mexico City.
The city does not charge the residents for pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City's urban services director, Francisco Gonzalez, says
critics are just out to take profits away from the pepenadores, who he
says increase the amount of garbage recycled. Groups such as BIO "want to
get rid of the pepenadores so they themselves can benefit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said the municipal system, which processes 4.5 million tons
of garbage a year, is about 66% cheaper than using private firms. He said
between 10% and 20% of the garbage is recycled.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a system that works; why change it?" he said.</TE>
<TE>'There Are Some Bad Smells'</TE>
<TE>   Cuauhtemoc Gutierrez, a Mexico City councilman, leads a group of about
1,800 pepenadores. His spokesman, Alejandro Enriquez, said there is no
reason to uproot the pickers.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on for years. It is part of the society here,"
Enriquez said. "They have their own houses; they live well, even though
there are some bad smells. The nonprofits have incorrect impressions of
the way they live and work."</TE>
<TE>   Although the pepenadores are reluctant to give up the work they have,
Buenrostro and his supporters believe that they might enjoy a cleaner
line of employment.</TE>
<TE>   Once more money comes into BIO through bag sales, Buenrostro hopes to
recruit and pay pepenadores or other low-income workers to make them.
Currently, Buenrostro and a tailor who doubles as a restaurant worker do
the sewing.</TE>
<TE>   "BIO has a mission that can really help people without many resources.
From garbage, they learn they can make things that have value," said
Patricio Lugo, spokesman for Fundacion Nemi, which invites BIO to give
workshops as part of the foundation's goal of providing alternate
education to young people. "Garbage is not garbage. It can be more."</TE>
<TE>   The workshops are not just about inner tubes. Hangers and newspaper
become baskets. Nylon stockings and supermarket plastic bags are woven
into purses. Plastic bottles are cut into wine cups, and colored bottles
are shaved into drinking glasses.</TE>
<TE>   But BIO's signature product is the black rubber bag that its members,
who now number about two dozen, hope will create a name for their group
in the United States. Some models are all black, others are decorated
with indigenous cloth straps, beads, metal ornaments and colored bands.
They include backpacks, shoulder bags, doctor's bags and triangular
purses.</TE>
<TE>Group's Leader Sold 3,000 Bags in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   BIO and those who sell similar products agree that it will be an
uphill battle to get them into U.S. stores.</TE>
<TE>   Driving a 1983 Volkswagen van, Buenrostro tooled around the
U.S.--limiting himself mostly to the Southeast and Midwest after the van
broke down--to seek out retailers and sold 3,000 bags over a year. He
returned late last month.</TE>
<TE>   Although BIO lacks money to promote its products, he hopes trips to

<TE>   There are few American companies that make bags and products from
inner tubes, said Rob Brandegee, president and co-founder of one of the
companies, Pittsburgh-based Little Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The market for recycled products "is pretty thin and tight. It's all
about marketing," said Brandegee, who maintains 3,000 accounts, mostly
with boutiques. Larger stores such as Macy's dropped his products because
"they were not a big hit."</TE>
<TE>   "It is not enough to have a good idea and have your heart in the right
place," he said. "But it is not hopeless. [BIO] just needs to partner
with someone who wants to move their products."</TE>

<HD>Powell Gets Cool Reception</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary of State is greeted with Saudi crown prince's
vow that Arab world will not aid peace effort until Israel withdraws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CASABLANCA, Morocco
</DL>
<LD>In an ominous reflection of growing Arab anger at the United
States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was greeted on the first leg
of his high-stakes Mideast mission Monday with a testy challenge about
the Bush administration's priorities and new demands before the Arab
world will aid the peace effort.</LD>
<LD>   Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia told Powell bluntly Monday that
the kingdom and other Arab nations are prepared to intervene only if
there is a complete Israeli withdrawal from all reoccupied territory,
U.S. monitors are deployed and commitments are made to rebuild
Palestinian institutions, a senior Arab official told reporters here
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Within that environment, it's more realistic to have a political
process in which people can cooperate," the official said.</LD>
<TE>   The crown prince warned that the United States is in danger from the
political spillover.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. interests in the region are suffering gravely, and U.S.
credibility and prestige are collapsing quickly," Adel al-Jubeir, the
senior foreign policy advisor to the crown prince, told reporters
traveling with Powell. "America must restrain" Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will face harm, said the official. "The war on terrorism will
go no place without the . . . Arab countries."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia feels especially betrayed by the lack of progress in
talks after it helped craft an Arab League peace initiative two weeks
ago. In a statement earlier Monday, the crown prince said the hand that
was extended sincerely in peace is the same hand that will do whatever is
necessary to protect the interests of the Arab community.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the United States and the Arab world was reflected
earlier in the day when Powell met Moroccan King Mohammed VI. "Don't you
think it was more important to go to Jerusalem first?" the monarch
bluntly asked Powell as cameras rolled--a conspicuously deliberate
act--as they began talks in the southern resort city of Agadir.</TE>
<TE>Powell Put on Defensive</TE>
<TE>   The meeting came a day after Morocco witnessed the largest
demonstration in its modern history--and the biggest in the Arab world
since the current crisis began, according to both U.S. and Moroccan
officials. At least half a million Moroccans--most local estimates of the
crowd put it at 2 million--poured onto the streets of Rabat, the capital,
to protest U.S. and Israeli policies.</TE>
<TE>   The depth of feeling was reflected in the king's cancellation of his
national wedding celebration because of the Israeli siege. During his
talks with Powell, the king wore a large button on his lapel with a
picture of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, one of the holiest Muslim
shrines.</TE>
<TE>   Powell came to Morocco, one of the more moderate Arab countries, to
appeal for help in persuading Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat to rein in militants and end violence. But in talks with both the
crown prince and the king, he found the agenda distinctly shaped by Arab
rage--and the United States on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco "adamantly denounced" the Israeli siege and called on the
United States to "spare no effort" to achieve an immediate and full
withdrawal so that Arafat can "regain his liberty," the palace said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   After their talks, Powell conceded that the Israeli operation has
triggered "significant and severe" consequences that threaten to
destabilize the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that Prime Minister Sharon and his colleagues are taking all
of this into account as the president asked them to when the operations
began 10 or 11 days ago. It is time for them to begin withdrawal and do
it as the president has indicated--now," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   After talks with Abdullah in Casablanca, Powell welcomed the
announcement of an Israeli withdrawal from two West Bank towns as an
encouraging sign. But he cautioned that the United States would wait to
see what the withdrawal means and how far it goes. The United States has
not seen Israel's plans, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Let us hope that this is not a little bit of this and a little bit of
that, but the beginning of a pullback," he said after a dinner meeting
with Abdullah. "Everybody would like to see a complete withdrawal."</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, who crafted the Arab League offer to Israel of full
recognition in exchange for withdrawal from all territories occupied in
the 1967 Middle East War, has become a key player in the crisis. The
United States hopes to use the offer as an incentive to Israel to get the
peace process back on track.</TE>
<TE>   With both Arab leaders, Powell defended U.S. strategy in attempting to
rally Arab support with his stops in Morocco, Egypt and Jordan this week.
He will also meet with European counterparts in Madrid to try to rally
the international community behind a common position.</TE>
<TE>   Mounting Arab anger is also producing a tough new line about the
sequence of actions required to end the latest Mideast crisis. Hassan
Aourid, spokesman for King Mohammed, said the Arab world now insists that
Israel initiate an end to the crisis by completely pulling out of
Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for Israel to take the first step to withdraw and
spare the lives of the Palestinian people," he told reporters traveling
with Powell in Agadir.</TE>
<TE>   Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher echoed Morocco's warning.
"The early litmus test is U.S. ability to effect a withdrawal soon. If it
doesn't do that, then Israel will have killed Powell's visit before it
starts. How can the U.S. pressure anyone when it cannot effect a
withdrawal by Israel? U.S. credibility is on the line here," he said in
an interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world is also taking an increasingly tough line on Powell's
meeting Arafat, which now looks more and more likely. The Moroccan king
and the Saudi prince insisted that Arafat's participation is critical to
Arab acceptance of the U.S. initiative.</TE>

<LD>Nineteen U.N. police officers were wounded when they tried to quell
a riot by hundreds of Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica, an ethnically divided
city in Kosovo, a U.N. spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   One officer was in serious condition, said Stefan Feller, chief of
U.N. police in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.</LD>
<LD>   The rioting began when U.N. police arrested a leader of a hard-line
group known as the Bridge Guards, said Marko Jaksic, a Serbian community
leader. The group has tried to prevent ethnic Albanians and Serbs from
crossing a bridge that divides the city between the two groups.</LD>

<HD>Hussein Suspends Iraqi Oil Exports in Protest</HD>
<DH>Embargo: The effort to show disapproval of Israel's offensive is
expected to hurt Iraqis more than those who buy the commodity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>Iraq suspended oil exports Monday to protest Israeli military
actions in the West Bank, a strategic decision that caused the world
price of crude oil to jump and increased pressure on Arab regimes to take
action against Israel and the United States.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech beamed by satellite to all corners of the Arab world,
Saddam Hussein sought to present himself as the only Arab head of state
willing to act on behalf of the Palestinians. His go-it-alone embargo is
expected to have a far greater impact on the tense political landscape of
the Middle East than on world oil supplies, especially if Israel
continues its offensive and other countries follow Iraq's lead.</LD>
<LD>   The price of oil jumped by about $1, to $26.98 a barrel, after the
announcement, before closing in New York at $26.54, a 33-cent increase.
Perhaps a more telling barometer of the decision's impact came in a
statement issued by the radical Islamic group Hamas. It accused Arab
leaders of treason to "God and the nation of Islam," praised the Iraqi
gesture and called on other regimes to follow suit.</LD>
<TE>   The Arab public is burning with anger over the Israeli military
operation and America's support for the Jewish state. Radical voices are
dominating the public dialogue. After Sept. 11, it would have been
unthinkable for crowds to march in Jordan chanting Osama bin Laden's
name, even if they had wanted to. But they were doing just that on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's gesture also undermined the White House effort to oust Hussein
from power.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein is trying to incite the street and embarrass the
oil-producing countries," said one well-placed Arab official. "He is
cashing in on the fact that the street is boiling, watching what is
unfolding. He is trying to exploit this to his advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 18-month Palestinian intifada--including Israel's
current offensive--Arab regimes have resisted taking any tough measures
such as imposing a coordinated oil embargo or opening their borders to
allow volunteers to fight alongside the Palestinians. Those steps are
perceived by leaders from Riyadh to Cairo as against their own political,
social or economic interests.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Israeli operation continues, that calculation is changing.
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab states to have signed peace treaties
with Israel, are under pressure to expel Israeli diplomats and sever all
ties with the Jewish state. Both have indicated that they will have to
respond to pressure from the street if Israel does not relent soon.</TE>
<TE>Oil as Political Tool Seems More Relevant</TE>
<TE>   Persian Gulf states that rely on oil sales for most of their revenue
are also feeling pressure to use the commodity for leverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The question of oil as a political tool really is becoming very
relevant now," said Radwan Abdullah, a political analyst in Amman, the
Jordanian capital. "There is a feeling of anger among the masses in a way
never felt before. If there is nothing forthcoming in political
negotiations, or at least an end to the massacres, it will become a
relevant question in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   But even if the immediate crisis calms, America's interest in the
region may already have been permanently damaged. Moderate regimes have
historically argued to a skeptical public that ties with the United
States gave them a means to advocate the Arab cause. But these days, the
perception is that Arab voices are going unheard in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders are holding their collective breath, hoping that events
in the West Bank cool before they are pushed to take some action that
will hurt them too.</TE>
<TE>   "We all applauded the American statements for telling Israel to comply
with American demands. We are watching and observing the behavior of the
United States," said an informed source from a Gulf state who declined to
be identified because of the volatility of the situation. U.S.
credibility was on the line, the source added.</TE>
<TE>   For months, as U.S. officials tried to round up support to topple the
regime in Iraq, Hussein also sent his emissaries to lobby in Arab
capitals. His surrogates even reopened talks with the United Nations
about allowing weapons inspectors back into the country.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Hussein himself delivered Iraq's message.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqi leadership declares the complete stoppage of oil exports
starting from this afternoon--for a period of 30 days, when we will
further decide policy, or until the Zionist entity's armed forces have
unconditionally withdrawn from the Palestinian territories," he said,
standing at a lectern.</TE>
<TE>   Playing to feelings of hurt pride and victimization among Arabs, he
said that Israel and the United States had "belittled the capabilities"
of Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's decision is likely to have little impact on world oil supplies.
The oil-rich country exports 2 million barrels a day, or just 4% of what
is available on the international market. Most of its oil is purchased by
the United States and Europe. The price increase was more a reflection of
jitters over the worsening situation in the region than the loss of Iraqi
crude on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries does not
make up the shortfall, it is expected that other producers such as Russia
will step in. The only way for Iraq's move to really hurt the
industrialized world would be if it kicked off a trend, either inspiring
or embarrassing other nations to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   That has not yet occurred. Kuwait immediately announced it would not
stop pumping oil. Sources in the Gulf region said Saudi Arabia had not
agreed to go along. Iran and Libya have both supported the concept of
using oil as a political weapon, but they did not give any indication
Monday of whether they would cut back.</TE>
<TE>Other Efforts Failed to Disrupt Markets</TE>
<TE>   The last time Arab nations used oil for leverage was in 1973, when
reduced exports caused a global energy crisis and played havoc with
Western economies. Since then, the world's wealthiest nations have
created a cushion for themselves against such disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's government has cut off oil sales in the past for political
reasons but has failed to disrupt world energy markets. Iraq last halted
exports for five weeks last summer to protest the proposed imposition of
so-called smart sanctions by the U.N., which would expedite imports of
approved civilian goods but place tighter controls on items with
potential military applications. The new sanctions system was later
endorsed by the Security Council and is scheduled to go into effect in
June.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any pain from the Iraqi move, it may be felt primarily by
Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is still functioning under sanctions imposed after the 1991 Gulf
War. It is allowed to sell crude only under a U.N. oil-for-food program.
Although Iraq reportedly manages to smuggle millions of barrels of oil to
Syria, Jordan and Turkey, which it does not plan to curtail, revenue for
the purchase of most necessities comes through the U.N. program.</TE>
<TE>   There should be little immediate impact on critical imports to Iraq,
said Hasmik Egian, an official at the U.N. office that supervises the
sanctions. The country could be strapped for cash if the cutoff continues
for 30 days or more. Iraq had already overestimated its anticipated oil
income for the year's first quarter, Egian said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House responded to Hussein's announcement by repeating its
accusation that Hussein, not the West, bears the responsibility for the
suffering of the Iraqi people. Iraq's action is "another sign that Saddam
Hussein is willing to starve his own people," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   But that message is not likely to have much resonance now in the Arab
world.</TE>
<TE>   In Jordan, at least 4,000 people gathered for the funeral of an
11-year-old boy who died Sunday of an injury suffered during an
anti-Israeli protest two days earlier. As they marched through the dusty
streets of the Baqaa refugee camp, they chanted slogans in support of Bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   In Sudan, protesters marched in the 104-degree heat, chanting, "Strike
back, Bin Laden!"</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, where authorities have struggled to hold down public anger,
state-run news media did not mention Hussein's announcement. But the
pan-Arab satellite network Al Jazeera did. "This is very important in
gaining the support of Arab public opinion," commentator Moustafa Al
Razrazi said on the broadcast.</TE>

<HD>Nablus Buckling Under West Bank Push</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The Israeli army rounds up scores of Palestinian men in
the heart of a militant stronghold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>First came the missiles raining from Israeli helicopters, then,
after daybreak, the armored personnel carriers blaring an ultimatum over
loudspeakers in broken Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   "We're stronger than you. You're outnumbered, and this is your last
chance!" went one announcement. "Any gunman does not have long to live!"</LD>
<LD>   By Monday night, the casbah--the heart of Nablus' old city and one of
the last redoubts of Palestinians resisting Israel's massive West Bank
offensive--had all but surrendered after a punishing five-day siege.</LD>
<TE>   The intense gunfire unleashed at Israeli tanks, helicopters and
soldiers ringing the old city throughout the weekend ended abruptly about
5 a.m. Monday. During the afternoon, scores of Palestinian men--some out
of ammunition, some prodded by the army's threats to blow up their
homes--ventured out with white flags to submit to Israeli detention,
interrogation and identity checks.</TE>
<TE>   Others wound up in Al Biek Mosque, converted by the siege into a
makeshift field hospital and morgue. On Monday evening, it was a scene
emblematic of the old city's suffering and humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Ten corpses lay side by side on prayer rugs in the mosque's tiny
courtyard, wrapped in bloody sheets and blankets. They included a young
militant in the green headband of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement and an elderly man whose hands were raised in
front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said they had buried 14 other men nearby, on the mosque's
grounds. The last was a volunteer who had transported the 13th body, just
before Israeli snipers on rooftops cut him down.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers, some of them ebullient and smiling, patrolled a
dark, muddy alley leading past blasted-out homes and shops toward the
mosque. Palestinian medical teams, dissuaded by Israeli snipers from
entering the old city during the fighting, were allowed in late Monday to
rush 48 wounded Palestinians from the mosque to two hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Ambulances raced to the edge of the casbah, and medics made their way
on foot past bomb-sized craters in the street, the ruins of a bulldozed
building, dangling wires from booby traps, discarded grenades and
unexploded bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it was in control of the casbah, with soldiers
patrolling strategic sections of its twisting maze of narrow alleys
dating from the Roman Empire. But gunfire and explosions echoed
sporadically early today from the casbah's Yasmin quarter, where a small
number of militants were holding out.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of Palestinian resistance here left many of the casbah's
20,000 inhabitants puzzled.</TE>
<TE>   "God only knows what happened to our fighters, why they stopped
shooting," said Walid Jardeh, a 60-year-old taxi driver hunkered down in
his home. "They were not prepared for this. Only God can help them now."</TE>
<TE>A Labyrinth Made for Guerrilla Warfare</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army's attack late Wednesday on Nablus, a militant
stronghold, prompted at least 200 Palestinian fighters to gather in the
casbah, a labyrinth made for guerrilla warfare. Its streets are too
narrow to accommodate tanks. When the battle was over, some residents
refused to believe that the militants had been defeated; some thought
maybe they had slipped away through underground tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an eerie silence over the whole neighborhood, which I've
never heard before," Raneen abu Zahra, 22, who lives at the edge of the
casbah, said after waking up Monday. "The only thing that breaks the
quiet is the sound of tanks moving."</TE>
<TE>   As the day wore on, men and boys between 18 and 40 complied with
Israeli orders to surrender. They gathered in groups, their hands locked
behind their necks, waiting in orderly lines to be processed by Israeli
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to leave and come to them because we didn't know what they
might do with us," said Abdullah Maslamani, a 25-year-old candy maker,
who was waiting with about 50 other men at an Israeli checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Maslamani said Israeli troops blew up a wall of his apartment Sunday
night, just after he and 12 other family members had vacated the room
that was demolished. The intruders locked the entire family in another
room, occupying the rest of the apartment before finally leaving at 4:30
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   A man living next door died of a heart attack during the late-night
assault, and his son was killed resisting the Israelis, Maslamani said.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 Palestinians surrendered here Monday, the army said. Some
were released after security checks, and the others were taken to a
school for more intensive interrogation and screening. The army says its
11-day-old West Bank offensive is aimed at rooting out Palestinian
terrorist networks. It said troops had found 13 explosives workshops
here, as well as quantities of ammunition, explosives and suicide bomb
belts.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear how many of the men who surrendered in the old city
were militants the army had faced in combat over the last several days.
Many of those held were middle-aged and overweight. Two were grown and
married sons of Nablus' mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it clear how many combatants were among the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Tawfi Gazal, a medic treating wounded at the mosque, said at least two
men died while waiting for medical care--one of gangrene after being shot
in the leg, another from a massive abdominal wound.</TE>
<TE>Life Continues Amid the Carnage</TE>
<TE>   One of the few healthy people amid the stench of death was Hala
Amireh, born Wednesday on the first day of the siege. Cradling her
newborn daughter, Asmahan Amireh said the family found shelter in the
mosque after an Israeli missile destroyed part of their house Sunday
night and Israeli soldiers returned Monday with a threat to blow up the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Ammar Amireh, a 26-year-old produce seller, said the soldiers tore up
his ID card and gave them half an hour to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to admire his daughter, he said, "May God make her world
better than ours."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Vows Veto of Another U.N. Mideast Resolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. said it would block an Arab attempt to get the Security
Council to pass its fourth resolution on the Middle East crisis in four
weeks, arguing in a protracted debate here Monday that further U.N.
action could undermine Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's cease-fire
mission.</LD>
<LD>   Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinian representative to the U.N., said he
hoped the council would adopt a new resolution demanding Israel's
immediate withdrawal from West Bank cities and decrying the "humanitarian
crisis" there. The proposed resolution, presented to the council Monday
night, would also endorse an undefined "international presence that could
help provide better conditions on the ground."</LD>
<LD>   But the United States made it clear that it would veto almost any U.N.
resolution on the Middle East this week. "We do not need any more
resolutions," said John D.Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations. "We need full implementation of the existing ones."</LD>
<TE>   The council planned to resume its deliberations today. Overnight,
Israeli forces began pulling out of two West Bank cities--the result of
pressure from the United States, not the United Nations, diplomats here
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, U.S. diplomats surprised critics here by drafting a
resolution endorsing Palestinian statehood, and then, as Israeli tanks
rolled through the streets of Ramallah, backing a European resolution
calling for Israel's withdrawal and a "meaningful" cease-fire.</TE>

<HD>Bethlehem Church Fire Is a Mystery</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israelis, Palestinians offer contradictory accounts of how
the blaze began.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The blood and fire of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict invaded
hallowed ground Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Six days after the standoff at the Church of the Nativity began,
predawn gunplay at the besieged church left a Palestinian policeman dead
and two Israeli soldiers wounded. A fire caused by the skirmish damaged a
Catholic parish building in the religious compound, which is believed to
mark the birthplace of Jesus.</LD>
<LD>   And the psychological and public relations war here escalated, making
the outlook increasingly ominous for nearly 80 priests, monks and nuns
inside who are either unwilling hostages, benevolent hosts or an
uncomfortable combination of the two.</LD>
<TE>   About the only thing Israelis and Palestinians agreed on Monday was
that the violence resulted in the standoff's first death within the
compound.</TE>
<TE>   But the Israeli military said Palestinian snipers shot two Israeli
border policemen deployed on a rooftop outside the compound, provoking an
exchange of gunshots and grenades that caused the fire. In contrast,
Palestinian leaders and some priests inside the compound said Israelis
attempted a sneak attack over a rooftop, set off the blaze and left
bullet holes inside the 4th century Church of the Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   The contradictory versions showed that the besieged church occupied by
more than 140 Palestinians--most of them accused terrorists, militia
fighters or members of security forces--has become an ironic symbol of
irreconcilable conflict. The drama is like a grim postcard from this
crossroads of faiths, a once-beautiful, now-ruined city in the hills
where things keep getting stranger.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was extinguished early Monday by Palestinian firefighters
based in Bethlehem. As an Arabic television station replayed images of
smoke rising over the spires and bell towers of the old city, the
firefighters sleepily puffed cigarettes and recalled the startling
emergency call they got at 4:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   An agitated Bethlehem Gov. Mohammed Madani, who is inside the Church
of the Nativity with the gunmen, was on the line exclaiming that
explosions and shots that had broken out an hour earlier had sparked a
fire in the compound, which is surrounded by Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Telephone negotiations ensued among Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
consular officials mediating from Jerusalem. The firefighters responded
and were permitted into the compound at 6:30 a.m. after they were
thoroughly searched by Israeli soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers, who had half a dozen extensible ladders in tow, looked
angry, the firefighters said. And the Palestinians inside were on edge
because a Palestinian Authority policeman, Khaled Siam, lay dead. It was
unclear how he died.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a critical situation," said firefighter Mohammed Yacoub. "The
people inside had some suspicions that we might be Israelis disguised as
firefighters. And we knew we were surrounded by Israeli snipers who, if
we made any kind of wrong move, might shoot at us."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze consumed wood furniture in the second-floor dining hall and
kitchen in a wing of the Franciscan monastery next to a compound wall.
The firefighters saw what they described as the remnants of flares and
stun grenades used by Israeli troops who, according to Palestinians
inside, had entered over the rooftop and fired into the church.</TE>
<TE>   Madani and others inside alleged in telephone interviews Monday that
as the incident began, an Israeli officer called and urged the governor
to surrender because a raid was imminent. Instead, the Israelis retreated
and left behind a two-way radio with Hebrew writing on it and four
rifles, Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   Siam was the second fatality of the siege; last week Israeli soldiers
shot and killed a mentally impaired bell ringer who they said ran from
the compound into the street and ignored orders to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the Israelis attacked," said Anton Salman, a
community leader in the church, who claimed that Israeli gunfire had hit
a 6th century mosaic. "There are bullet holes in the walls and in the
mosaic also."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, responded an Israeli army spokesman, who said no Israeli had
entered the churchyard. Troops outside in Manger Square opened fire and
threw smoke grenades only to protect the evacuation of the wounded border
police officers, who are part of a paramilitary unit specializing in
hostage situations, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Marcus
Scheff. One policeman was in serious condition, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to evacuate the two policemen while we were under fire, which
is outrageous," Scheff said. "They are literally trying to provoke us,
shooting to provoke us to enter. . . . They have large caches of weapons
in there, don't forget, and some might be Israeli weapons."</TE>
<TE>   The fire could have been caused by the Palestinians, who may have
errantly thrown a grenade, or by the Israeli smoke grenades, Scheff said.
The mystery will probably go unsolved as long as the standoff is
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis has caused alarm among religious leaders around the world,
with the Vatican expressing concern that Israelis might have aggravated
"an already dramatic situation."</TE>
<TE>   The tension reverberated outside the churchyard walls Monday, even
though the Israeli army lifted a curfew for the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A semblance of normality returned to parts of Bethlehem. People
congregated outside stores. Cars filled the streets. A taxi sped by
carrying a Palestinian fighter named Khaled, who was wounded in last
week's fighting and apparently was taking advantage of the opportunity to
leave town.</TE>
<TE>   But after several days of quiet, the lifted curfew also brought an
unexpected and persistent resurgence of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Some of it sounded like it came from lone Palestinians with
small-caliber weapons sniping at Israeli troops responding with heavy
machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   In Medbasseh Square, troops reportedly did most of the shooting.
Palestinians alleged that soldiers fired from a side street into the
plaza near an area that is still under curfew because it adjoins the
Church of the Nativity. The plaza became a shooting gallery with
pedestrians stranded on either side. Women carrying groceries ducked and
ran across the danger zone as bullets flew into a wall above their heads.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds Anonymity for Book Buyers</HD>
<DH>Law: The Colorado high court cites 'fundamental right' of privacy.
More crime investigators have been seeking the records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Colorado Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the state's
constitution protects the privacy of both bookstore owners and their
customers when it refused to force a Denver retailer to turn sales
records over to police.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts predicted that the decision would slow, if not halt, the
recent trend of investigators seeking records of book purchases or video
rentals as a quick way to track suspects or bolster a prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago, independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr surprised
booksellers when he subpoenaed the records of a Washington store, seeking
purchases made by Monica S. Lewinsky.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, there has been "an alarming increase in the number of
bookstore subpoenas and search warrants," including requests to online
booksellers, said Chris Finan, president of the American Booksellers
Foundation for Free Expression.</TE>
<TE>   But the bookstore owners have fought back, and they won an important
victory Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1st Amendment embraces the individual's right to purchase and
read whatever books she wishes to, without fear the government will take
steps to discover which books she buys, reads and intends to read," the
Colorado court said in a unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   This "fundamental constitutional right . . . to purchase books
anonymously" cannot be swept aside, the judges said, except in the rare
instance where police can show the information is absolutely essential
and cannot be obtained in any other way.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the "innocent, third-party bookseller" deserves an
opportunity to contest these claims in a special hearing, the state court
said. Typically, a magistrate approves a police officer's request for a
search warrant without hearing from anyone who opposes it.</TE>
<TE>   In the case decided Monday, police were trying to determine who had
run a methamphetamine lab. Two years ago, police raided a trailer park in
Thornton, Colo., and found the lab, but it was unclear who among several
suspects was the operator.</TE>
<TE>   In the bedroom of one trailer, police found two how-to books on making
illegal drugs. They also found a mailing envelope from the Tattered
Cover, a popular Denver bookstore, but there was no receipt to show who
had purchased the books and no name on the envelope, only the trailer's
address.</TE>
<TE>   The officers obtained a subpoena from the Drug Enforcement
Administration for the purchase records. Joyce Meskis, the owner of
Tattered Cover, refused to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Police then obtained a search warrant from the Denver district
attorney's office. Six officers went to the bookstore to carry out the
search, but Meskis contacted her lawyer, who persuaded prosecutors to
wait until a hearing could be held.</TE>
<TE>   Meskis said her customers were aware of the 1st Amendment and their
right to privacy. "This is not an uninformed society. They care," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge, however, concluded that the police had shown a strong
need for the information and upheld the search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   But Colorado's highest court immediately took up the issue and quashed
the search warrant Monday. Its judges pointed out that police had
sufficient evidence to determine who occupied the trailer where the
illegal lab was found. They did not need the book receipt to "connect"
the methamphetamine lab to the occupant of the trailer, the judges said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is this case a victory for readers and book purchasers in
Colorado, [but] we believe the court's opinion sets an important
precedent for readers, bookstores and library patrons throughout the
country," Meskis said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ruling relies in large part on Colorado's state
constitution, it is not a binding precedent for courts around the nation.
However, for the same reason, Colorado police cannot appeal the outcome
to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court's jurisdiction is limited to
questions of federal law or the U.S. Constitution, and the justices do
not review rulings that stand on state law.</TE>
<TE>   Finan, the president of the booksellers' group, called Monday's ruling
"the strongest opinion by any court on the importance of protecting
customer privacy in bookstores. It will influence judges deciding future
cases."</TE>
<TE>   He and other lawyers said the principles set in the ruling would apply
equally to videos as well as books. However, two experts on the 1st
Amendment differed on whether bookstores deserve a special place in the
law.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh questioned why purchases from
bookstores were more private than a conversation between two friends or
co-workers. Judges routinely have upheld court orders that require
individuals to testify about their conversations. For example, in a job
discrimination lawsuit, employees are required to reveal what others said
in private meetings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at the University of Minnesota,
said the freedom to exchange ideas demands a broad protective shield.
"The issue comes down to whether we want the government to find out what
we are reading," she said.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Governor Vetoes Nuclear Waste Dump Site</HD>
<DH>Environment: Hauling spent fuel to Yucca Mountain is dangerous,
Guinn warns. Congress can override the decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn on Monday vetoed the use of Yucca Mountain
as the nation's underground repository of highly radioactive nuclear
waste, declaring that the $60-billion proposal is "based on bad science,
bad law and bad public policy."</LD>
<LD>   In February, President Bush recommended to Congress that Yucca
Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, serve as a permanent burial
ground for the nation's 77,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel.</LD>
<LD>   "Let me make one thing clear, crystal clear in fact. Yucca Mountain is
not inevitable," Guinn told supporters Monday at the University of
Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   "We will expose the Department of Energy's dirty little secrets about
Yucca Mountain," Guinn said, charging that the government had not studied
the dangers of transporting the waste across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn said the nuclear power industry has spent $100 million in
support of Yucca Mountain and he asked each Nevadan to send in $1 to help
counter that offensive.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican governor later headed to Washington, where his "notice
of disapproval" will be filed with both houses of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn's veto was allowed under a nuclear waste policy act Congress
wrote in 1982, which gives the governor of a targeted state the power to
reject the president's selection. Congress will have the final say,
however. It has 90 legislative days to debate the issue, and a vote is
expected in July.</TE>
<TE>   If simple majorities in the House and Senate vote to override Guinn's
veto, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would decide in a few years
whether to license the project. The project could still be derailed by
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the House probably will vote to support the project,
which already represents a $6-billion government investment. They are
hoping it will be rejected by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic Whip Harry Reid of Nevada said most Senate Democrats
have promised to support his state. But at least 15 votes from the GOP
side will be needed to uphold Nevada's veto, and so far only two--John
Ensign, a freshman from Nevada, and Ben Night-horse Campbell of
Colorado--have opposed the plans.</TE>
<TE>Scientists Revise Feasibility Study</TE>
<TE>   Congress decided 15 years ago to consider only Yucca Mountain for
nuclear waste disposal, and the Department of Energy has concluded that
the site is feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Government scientists initially believed that the geology of Yucca
Mountain was sufficient to contain radioactivity. They have now concluded
that it will provide little more than a web of underground storage
tunnels and that protection from radiation will depend on the
millenniums-long durability of man-made containers to protect the
material from, among other things, corrosive moisture and the possibility
of earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have lined up heavyweight lobbyists. Arguing against the
use of Yucca Mountain are John D. Podesta, a former chief of staff for
President Clinton, and Kenneth M. Duberstein, former chief of staff for
President Reagan. The nuclear industry enlisted the help of John H.
Sununu, former chief of staff for the senior President Bush, and
Geraldine A. Ferraro, the onetime vice presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada, in a media campaign targeting states where senators are
waffling, will hammer on the theme that the transportation of radioactive
waste across the country will create "nuclear neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign "will educate Americans and help senators who are
inclined to support us but don't feel they can because they don't sense
support back home to oppose Yucca Mountain," said Reid spokesman Nathan
Naylor.</TE>
<TE>   Grass-roots efforts to kill the Yucca Mountain project also are
underway. A coalition of 16 organizations, including the Sierra Club, the
Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social
Responsibility, sent a letter to senators March 26 imploring them to
reject the project because of unresolved scientific questions.</TE>
<TE>   Activists from 25 states are planning to converge on Washington next
Tuesday to argue against Yucca Mountain, said Lisa Gue, a policy analyst
for the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Senators face a political dilemma in considering the best interests of
their own states when deciding the fate of Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Many agree with Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, who
concluded that the nuclear industry and the public are better served by
shipping spent fuel rods--which will remain radioactive for 250,000
years--to Yucca Mountain. The waste is now stored at 131 facilities in 37
states.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy, the Bush administration says, will allow for better
long-term security of the lethal material, especially in a post-Sept. 11
environment.</TE>
<TE>   But those same senators may wince at the notion of trains and trucks
transporting nuclear waste across their states, where it could be
vulnerable to accident or attack.</TE>
<TE>   In his 10-page argument to Congress, Guinn pointed out that, even as
about 100,000 waste shipments head to Yucca Mountain over three decades,
new waste will be generated and will have to be stored at those sites to
cool before it can be shipped elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Guinn argued, Yucca Mountain will not eliminate the existence of
nuclear waste around the country.</TE>

<HD>Traficant Case Goes to Jurors</HD>
<DH>Trial: The maverick Ohio congressman rips the government in his
surprisingly subdued closing argument.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>In the final minutes of his closing argument Monday, Rep. James A.
Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) waved a roll of toilet paper in the air for the
jury to see.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll leave this here for you because this is all they have," said
Traficant, who despite not having a law degree represented himself in his
trial on federal corruption charges. During the proceedings, Traficant
had berated U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells for siding with the
prosecution and charged that she was making a mockery of the
Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-count indictment of the nine-term congressman includes
allegations that he made on-the-clock congressional staffers shovel horse
manure on his farm, helped a convicted felon get federal contracts, filed
false tax returns and forced one staffer to kick back half of his $2,500
monthly salary as a condition of employment.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the 10-week trial and into his final remarks, Traficant,
60, attempted to argue what he called a "vendetta defense," his
contention that the government had been out to get him for 20 years. He
was warned repeatedly by Wells that he could not introduce his theory in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "Move along, congressman," Wells told him several times during his
90-minute closing.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, known for his bombastic speeches on the floor of the House
of Representatives and, more recently, his outbursts in court, was mostly
subdued Monday. Spectators who stood 10 deep in the hallway outside the
overflow courtroom strained to hear the uncharacteristically soft-spoken
Traficant make his final appeal to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a . . . bit of evidence that anyone gave me any money,"
he said in one of his louder moments. Traficant used vulgarities to
describe the prosecution's case and called it a "dissertation on
hearsay."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's main point in his rambling argument seemed to be that the
government--particularly the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service--had
grown "too powerful." In questioning the case against him, Traficant
asked: "Where's the videotapes? Where's the airplane surveillance?" He
also reiterated that the government had not found his fingerprints on any
of the papers it collected, a fact the prosecution introduced during its
case. "They can make a case against you and scare you and scare your wife
and scare your kids and take your property," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His argument was hotly disputed by Assistant U.S. Atty. Craig Morford,
who asked the jurors to ask themselves how Traficant could evaluate the
evidence against him since he boasted that he had never examined it.</TE>
<TE>   "He just described to you a world that is very different from the
world you and I live in," Morford said. "It is a world filled with
coincidences, convenient excuses and convoluted conspiracies."</TE>
<TE>   Morford said Traficant used his elected position as a "trough to feed
his personal appetite." The lead prosecutor, who has been as calm as
Traficant has been unpredictable, held up an enlarged photograph of the
congressman in an embrace with a convicted felon.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is why is a U.S. congressman embracing this bad guy?"
Morford asked the jury. "You know why. The evidence shows why. There's an
old saying: 'Tell me who your friends are and I'll tell you what you are
up to.' "</TE>
<TE>   Morford appealed to the jury of eight women and four men to use their
"common sense" in evaluating the testimony of more than 55 witnesses and
he urged them to pay careful attention to damaging testimony elicited by
Traficant from his own witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   As the jury departed to deliberate, court observers said Traficant
cannot be counted out. In 1983, Traficant, then an elected sheriff, was
acquitted after representing himself in a bribery trial where the
government presented videotape of him accepting $163,000 from mob
figures. He emerged from that trial as a hero in his native Mahoning
Valley in northeast Ohio and ran successfully for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, an elected Democrat who has been stripped of his committee
assignments by the party leadership, has vowed to run again as an
independent.</TE>

<LD>A man accused of killing seven co-workers asked office colleagues
to sign his will as witnesses four days before the shooting, one of
theemployees testified in Cambridge for the prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Michael McDermott, 43, a software engineer, is on trial for gunning
down his co-workers Dec. 26, 2000, allegedly as revenge for Edgewater
Technology Inc.'s plan to withhold a big portion of his wages to pay off
taxes owed to the IRS.</LD>
<LD>   The defense claims McDermott was insane at the time, suffering from
schizophrenia, and unable to understand his actions. But prosecution
witnesses described McDermott's as calm and "jovial" in the week before
the killings.</LD>
<TE>   Bruce Lundie, a company project manager, testified that on Dec. 22,
2000, McDermott asked him and two other colleagues to witness his will.

<LD>Republican leaders in Alabama thought it was a joke when Richard M.

<LD>   "Funny name," a worker said with a smirk, thinking the man was using

<LD>A man serving a life sentence for the 1991 stabbing death of a
bartender was released from a Yuma prison after prosecutors said DNA
tests indicated he wasn't responsible for the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said a DNA sample taken from saliva and blood found on the
stabbing victim didn't match inmate Ray Krone's DNA. Those samples
matched the DNA of a man incarcerated for an unrelated sex crime, a
prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Alfred Fenzel ordered Krone's immediate release from a prison in
Yuma.</LD>
<TE>   Krone's conviction was not thrown out. But the Maricopa County
attorney said if additional evidence showed Krone wasn't involved in the
crime, he would ask for the case to be dismissed.</TE>

<HD>Overflow in Many U.S. Hospitals, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times wire services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>At least 90% of large U.S. hospitals with more than 300 beds
operate at or over capacity for treating patients and sometimes have to
divert ambulances to other hospitals, a survey reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The finding suggests that many emergency rooms are unable to handle
even the day-to-day stresses, let alone any big emergencies, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   A chronic shortage of nurses, growing piles of paperwork and legions
of uninsured people who use emergency rooms as their personal doctors are
all contributing to the mess, according to the survey, which was done for
the American Hospital Assn.--which lobbies for increased federal funding
and other priorities--and the American College of Emergency Physicians.</LD>
<TE>   "As we speak, hundreds of patients throughout the country are in the
hallways of emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed," said Dr.
Brent Asplin, an emergency room doctor in St. Paul, Minn., and a
spokesman for the emergency physicians' group.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that six out of 10 hospitals nationwide are filled to
capacity. The larger the hospital, the worse the problem, the survey
found. One in three are so crowded that ambulances are sometimes diverted
to other hospitals, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The situation will only get worse as the population ages, hospital
association executive vice president Rick Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time when patients' needs are increasing, the nation's
hospitals are facing a severe shortage of key hospital workers and
soaring costs of the goods and services they need to do their jobs for
their communities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group did not blame the for-profit health-care system and the
growing dominance of managed care. "Only 14% of the nation's hospitals
are for-profit," said Carmela Coyle, director of policy for the hospital
association.</TE>
<TE>   But she said state-federal health insurance programs did not pay
enough to cover treatment for the poor and the elderly. "The Medicare
program pays less than the cost of caring for a patient on Medicaid," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals also cannot keep enough staff on the payroll. "There are
more than 168,000 unfilled positions, of which 75% are for registered
nurses," the association said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The 40 million people who lack health insurance add to the burden,
coming to the emergency room for every minor ailment or, worse, waiting
until they are seriously ill.</TE>
<TE>   Overcapacity problems appear to be most acute in New England, where
52% of hospitals say they are operating beyond capacity, and on the West
Coast, where 44% reported the same.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, conducted by the Lewin Group, included 1,501 hospitals, or
36% of American hospitals with emergency departments. Demographically,
participating hospitals appeared to be representative of all U.S.
hospitals, the hospital association said.</TE>

<HD>House Ready to Exempt Groups From Campaign Finance Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The House is poised this week to approve legislation that would
ease donation-reporting rules for a broad class of political groups,
opening a new front in the campaign finance debate.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the measure, coming just weeks after the enactment of a
landmark law to limit donations to national political parties, could
encourage certain groups to receive huge contributions from wealthy
donors while escaping effective scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   The groups in question are tax-exempt political organizations that
claim to not be involved with federal campaigns. While many focus on
purely local matters, some of the groups do align themselves with parties
or advocate positions on important social issues, such as abortion rights
or gun control.</LD>
<TE>   Some campaign reform advocates fear these groups will soon become new
magnets for the unlimited political donations called soft money. Under
the new law, federal candidates and national parties will no longer be
able to raise soft money after this fall's elections.</TE>
<TE>   But this latest twist in the campaign finance debate has more to do
with disclosure rules than with donation limits.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two years ago, Congress passed a law requiring these political
groups--known as "527 committees" for the section of the tax code that
governs their activities--to report their sources of financial support
and their expenditures to the Internal Revenue Service. At the time, the
law was described as a reform to shine a spotlight on a little-known but
growing arena of political activity.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, many local groups complain that they have been caught by
the reporting requirements, even though they have nothing to do with
federal campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Under a bill scheduled to come before the House as early as Wednesday,
the 2000 law would be amended to exempt many state and local groups from
the federal disclosure rules.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said his measure aims simply to fix a law that forces
local political organizations across the country to disclose their
financial activities twice--once to state authorities and once to the
IRS.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas denied that his measure would weaken existing campaign
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody gets out of reporting," Thomas said. "There are no loopholes."
Every significant political group, he said, would be forced to report
either to a state or a federal authority.</TE>
<TE>   The Thomas measure is part of a broader bill to strengthen taxpayer
protections that enjoys wide bipartisan support. Democrats, led by Rep.
Lloyd Doggett of Texas, failed last month in a largely party-line vote to
strip the provision from the bill. The bill itself cleared the committee
on a 34-6 vote.</TE>
<TE>   But campaign reform advocates are taking aim at the provision as the
House vote approaches. Today they plan to attack the Thomas measure as
they release a report from the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen that
details the prominent role of 527 committees in national politics.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the report as evidence that independent groups are a growing
force in politics, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said the Thomas
measure could "open up new loopholes for secret money to be funneled into
election campaigns." Opponents of Thomas' proposal say it would allow
national issue-oriented organizations to set up state or local committees
that would be exempt from the current reporting requirements.</TE>
<TE>   One example of a major political expenditure through a 527 committee
emerged late in the 2000 campaign. The actress Jane Fonda gave about $12
million in three chunks to the Washington-based group Pro Choice Vote,
IRS records show. The money was then spent on political activities
supporting abortion rights in several states.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas said his measure would continue to require federal
disclosure for such donations.</TE>
<TE>   While Thomas is expected to succeed in the House, his provision faces
stiff opposition from some senators, including Lieberman and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), the leading advocate of the new campaign law.</TE>

<HD>Herb Seems to Interfere With Chemo</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>St. John's wort appears to interfere powerfully with a common
cancer drug and can reduce its punch for weeks after people stop taking
the herbal supplement, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   St. John's wort is often taken as an over-the-counter remedy for mild
depression, though its effectiveness has been questioned. Doctors also
know the herb can interfere with the body's use of a variety of other
medicines.</LD>
<LD>   In a small study released Monday, doctors showed that St. John's wort
decreases blood levels of one chemotherapy drug by about 40%. This effect
lingered for more than three weeks after people stopped taking the
supplement.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Ron Mathijssen of the Rotterdam Cancer Institute in the
Netherlands, who directed the study, said St. John's wort could reduce
the ability of chemotherapy to knock down cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't realize it is a drug because you don't need a
prescription. People think it's harmless," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mathijssen presented the results of the study, conducted on five
patients, at a meeting in San Francisco of the American Assn. for Cancer
Research.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the study's small size, experts said the findings are
believable because they fit with earlier reports showing that St. John's
wort can disrupt drug treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration warned that the herb
can interfere with protease inhibitors, drugs that are widely used to
treat AIDS.</TE>

<HD>Atlantis Blasts Off With Seconds to Spare</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Atlantis thundered into orbit Monday with a new part
for the international space station, a 44-foot section of latticework
that is equipped with a rail car and track.</LD>
<LD>   Atlantis and its crew soared into a clear sky at 4:44 p.m. local time,
four days late because of a leaky fuel line on the launch pad that had to
be repaired. A last-minute computer problem in the firing room almost
forced another delay, but controllers quickly reloaded the system
software and launched Atlantis with just 11 seconds to spare in its
five-minute launch window.</LD>
<LD>   "You spent a few extra days in Florida, but it's time for you guys to
take a ride," launch director Mike Leinbach told the seven astronauts.
"So we wish you luck."</LD>
<TE>   "We'll see you back here in about 11 days," commander Michael
Bloomfield replied.</TE>
<TE>   Security at the launch site was tight, as it has been since the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks, with fighter jets and attack helicopters on the
lookout for intruders in no-fly and no-sail zones. Three small planes
violated the airspace and were escorted down by F-15s; a ship also was
chased away.</TE>
<TE>   A new NASA security policy kept the astronauts' whereabouts under
wraps until they arrived at the pad.</TE>
<TE>   NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe congratulated controllers for beating
the end of the five-minute launch window.</TE>
<TE>   "You had 11 seconds to spare. Another day at your office, right? No
big deal," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Astronaut Jerry Ross made history at liftoff, becoming the first
person to rocket away from Earth seven times.</TE>
<TE>   When the 54-year-old retired Air Force colonel ventures outside this
weekend with Lee Morin, a 49-year-old Navy doctor, the two will become
the first pair of grandfathers to take a spacewalk. Their nickname: the
Silver Team.</TE>

<HD>Bush Reiterates Call for Volunteers</HD>
<DH>Policy: The president urges acts of kindness to show the 'true face
of America.' He also pushes protection for insurers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush shifted his public attention Monday from the Middle
East to domestic concerns arising from the Sept. 11 attacks, renewing his
call for volunteerism and pushing the Senate to pass a bill to protect
businesses from terrorist-induced losses.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and Washington Mayor Anthony Williams
flew here with Bush aboard Air Force One and joined him in a private
meeting with leaders from other cities--including Redondo Beach and
Placentia. Bush also gave a speech that spotlighted his fledgling Citizen
Corps, part of the volunteerism program he detailed in January. Hahn and
Williams then accompanied him back to Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The two Democratic mayors were on hand to support Bush's efforts to
build upon the communal spirit sparked by the September attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's trip was the second time Bush has met with Hahn, who said he
asked the president to back federal reimbursement for cities for
increased security measures taken since the attacks. Hahn and other
mayors have lobbied for the assistance to cover an estimated $2.6 billion
that citizens will spend by the end of 2002, a toll that is draining many
municipal budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has proposed giving local governments $3.5 billion to improve
police, fire and rescue services, but that money could not be used to
replace money already spent on police overtime and other costs.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not give a lot of encouragement to me on that subject," Hahn
said after talking privately with Bush on Monday. The mayor added that he
will keep working with congressional leaders on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Senate considered Bush's call to immediately act on
terrorism insurance legislation but again found itself snagged in a
partisan dispute over what should be included in the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP-controlled House approved a measure in November that would
provide insurance companies a federal safety net to cover future
terrorist attacks. But the measure has bogged down in the Democratic-run
Senate by a dispute over provisions that would limit the legal rights of
victims of terrorists, among them a prohibition on punitive damages and a
limit on attorney's fees in terrorism-related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The administration says the measure is needed to head off a threat by
insurers to exclude terrorism coverage on commercial policies or to
drastically increase the cost of such protection.</TE>
<TE>   After his return to Washington, Bush framed the need for the bill as a
"jobs issue."</TE>
<TE>   "If people can't buy insurance on a construction project, they're not
going to build a project," he said. "And if they don't build a project,
somebody's not working. That's the simplest way I can describe the issue
at hand."</TE>
<TE>   Insurance payouts from the Sept. 11 attacks are expected to range from
$30 billion to $70 billion. Under the House measure, when claims from a
future attack exceed $1 billion, the government would cover 90% of the
losses, up to $100 billion. The government would recoup its money from an
assessment on insurance firms and perhaps a surcharge on policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   The measure provides the protection only for the next year, with a
possible extension of two years.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has spent the last several days accelerating his administration's
efforts to calm the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The speech on volunteerism reflected a renewed effort by him to focus
on domestic programs that have been created, or given new emphasis, as a
result of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn was on the stage at the Knoxville Civic Center with Bush as the
president spoke to several thousand police officers, emergency
technicians and other local residents about a program he said was begun
in Los Angeles to help citizens prepare for disasters.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Community Emergency Response Teams are drawn from
volunteers trained by the fire department in disaster preparations, and
they work as community-based support for official emergency
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives people a chance to be a part of an emergency response
mechanism," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting his call for increased volunteerism, Bush said: "If you want
to join in the war against terror, you can join the Citizen Corps, or you
can act out of compassion and concern to help make somebody's life
brighter. It is the gathering momentum of millions of acts of kindness
and decency and compassion which show the world the true face of
America."</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned by Bush, the Citizen Corps would include medical reserve
teams that could respond to terrorist attacks. It also would consist of a
type of super-neighborhood watch program that would, among other things,
encourage transportation workers--such as truckers, letter carriers and
ship captains--to report suspicious activities through a toll-free
hotline.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush was touting his program, his own backing for community action
was questioned by a spokesman for Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the
ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. The spokesman,
David J. Sirota, said Bush's budget proposal for next year would
effectively eliminate grants to state and local governments for the
Clinton administration's Community Oriented Policing Services program.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats plan to fight that Bush proposal, saying the program is more
important than ever in the post-Sept. 11 environment.</TE>

<HD>Costly Prescriptions Go Unfilled, Medicaid Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Adding to the perception that prescription drug costs are
burdensome for a growing number of Americans, a new national study shows
that more than one in four Medicaid recipients could not afford at least
one prescription medication in the previous 12 months.</LD>
<LD>   And the proportion of Medicaid patients who had to leave at least one
prescription unfilled was highest--one in three--in states that have done
the most to control their Medicaid drug costs, according to the survey of
33,000 families.</LD>
<LD>   The study, to be released today by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center
for Studying Health System Change, is the latest to indicate that even as
prescription drugs become more effective in the treatment of disease and
chronic medical conditions, more Americans are having trouble paying for
them.</LD>
<TE>   While Congress and the Bush administration are under increasing
political pressure to make prescription drugs more affordable for
seniors, the new study indicates that all segments of the population are
having a hard time covering their cost. It found that 23 million American
adults, or 12% of the nation's adult population, could not afford to have
at least one prescription filled in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   But the study's authors were most troubled by the finding that 26% of
the 39 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid--the federal-state health
care program for the poor--had to forgo getting a prescription filled
because of cost. The proportion of adults with no health coverage at all
who could not afford at least one prescription--29%--was only slightly
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "Medicaid is expected to ensure access to affordable care for the
poorest and sickest Americans," Len Nichols, the center's vice president,
said Monday. "The study raises serious questions about the impact of
state efforts to control Medicaid drug spending."</TE>
<TE>   More than half of Medicaid recipients ages 18 to 64 have a chronic
condition such as diabetes, arthritis, heart disease or cancer, and more
than a quarter suffer from at least two such conditions. In addition,
more than half of all nonelderly adult Medicaid beneficiaries have
incomes below the federal poverty level of $8,590 for a single person.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Nichols said, private sector cost-control methods such as
requiring the use of generic drugs and imposing co-payments do not
translate well to the Medicaid program, whose beneficiaries need more
prescription drugs and have less money to pay for them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Nichols was quick to acknowledge that prescription drugs--the
nation's fastest-growing health-care cost--are straining state, as well
as personal, budgets.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 to 2000, Medicaid expenditures for drugs grew at least 50%
in all but two or three states, and by 90% or more in seven states,
according to earlier studies by the federal government and the Kaiser
Family Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Given that rate of increase, state governments are "very justified" in
restricting the drugs Medicaid patients can get without special approval,
limiting the number of prescriptions Medicaid will cover each month,
increasing prescription co-payments or imposing other cost-control
measures, said Joan Henneberry, director of health policy for the
National Governors Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that adult Medicaid patients who lived in states that
have instituted four or five cost-control measures--including West
Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina--were twice as
likely to have trouble affording prescription drugs as those who lived in
states with only one or two such restrictions. But with the economic
downturn and spending increases causing budget crunches in almost every
state, many Medicaid programs are imposing or considering new limits on
prescription drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to keep necessary medications out of the hands of
Medicaid enrollees" but states "have to do something," Henneberry said.
"They're trying to manage this benefit in a fiscally responsible way."</TE>
<TE>   Gail Margolis, director of Medi-Cal, said that with careful
management, California's Medicaid program has prevented prescription drug
costs from spiraling out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Medi-Cal limits the drugs it covers with "a very sophisticated and
expansive [drug] formulary," she said, and Medi-Cal beneficiaries pay a
$1 co-pay per prescription. Beneficiaries also are limited to six
prescriptions per month; for additional prescriptions, the patient's
doctor must file an authorization request.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, Margolis said, are the large discounts the
state has negotiated with drug manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some consumer advocates said the new study shows that states
wanting to control prescription drug costs should target the pricing
policies of the industry, rather than the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   But the pharmaceutical industry, contending that its products are
often the most cost-effective form of health care treatment, simply
pointed the finger at state governments.</TE>
<TE>   "Medicaid program directors who face tight budgets should thoroughly
study their entire system rather than automatically cutting the
pharmaceutical benefit," Alan F. Holmer, president of the trade group
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a
statement.</TE>

<HD>Malpractice Suits Lead to Texas Protest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EDINBURG, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of doctors and other medical professionals closed their
offices Monday to protest malpractice lawsuits that they say have led to
skyrocketing insurance premiums.</LD>
<LD>   Many of them descended on the Hidalgo County Courthouse for a "day of
awareness."</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Jose Igoa, a 47-year-old psychiatrist who held a picket sign, says
he paid $28,000 for medical malpractice insurance last year--three to
four times what he paid five years ago. Now, he can't find a renewal
policy.</LD>
<TE>   Like other doctors here, he says, he has been the target of frivolous
lawsuits that take time out of his practice and are stressful. He says
the problem is getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doctors. We train more than half of our lives to help people.
We don't want to cause harm to anybody," he said. "We understand that
when we cause some damage we want people to be fairly compensated. But
when it comes to legal extortion . . . it changes the way we practice
medicine."</TE>
<TE>   Up the coast in Nueces County, where 63% of doctors had claims filed
against them in the last 13 years, doctors planned simultaneous
activities to show support.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency services at hospitals will not be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "They see this as a plea for survival for doctors and patients," said
Jon Opelt of Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, which helped organize and
publicize the protest.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the walkout say doctors are being misled by groups backed
by big business and seeking limits on jury awards. They say there's no
guarantee that insurance companies will pass savings from such limits on
to policyholders. Meanwhile, they say, tort reforms give patients less
recourse against medical errors that kill more people than car accidents,
cancer or AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, seven of 17 malpractice insurance carriers serving Texas
have left or gone belly up, according to the Texas Department of
Insurance.</TE>

<HD>Koppel, ABC Reach Deal on Future of 'Nightline'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>ABC has made what the network described as a renewed commitment to
its late-night news program "Nightline," whose future was recently
threatened by the network's attempt to lure comedian David Letterman from
CBS to fill its time slot.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides remained mum on what exactly was said that allowed them to
get beyond that episode, which fueled uncertainty as to whether
"Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel and his key staff members would continue at
ABC while setting off a discussion about the future of network news
within major entertainment companies.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Koppel gave his first interviews about the situation, which
he addressed previously in an op-ed piece for the New York Times. Koppel
also issued a statement on March 11, the day Letterman announced his
intent to stay at CBS, chiding ABC parent Walt Disney Co. for what he
characterized as the "collateral damage" done to "Nightline" and ABC
News.</LD>
<TE>   "What we have is some private assurances, and the nature of the
agreement depends on those assurances remaining private," Koppel said
Monday, adding that he was "very happy and satisfied by the outcome of
the conversations."</TE>
<TE>   Disney President Robert Iger, meanwhile, issued a statement saying
that the company looks forward "to working with ABC News to make a strong
program even stronger in the coming years."</TE>
<TE>   ABC News declined to comment about a wire service report stating that
the network had committed to keeping "Nightline" in its current time slot
for a minimum of two years.</TE>
<TE>   Koppel said the expectation is that the show will go on for years but
that there was no specific conversation about it continuing beyond his
existing contract, which runs through 2005. "My personal hope is that it
will survive long after I'm gone, but I have no immediate plans to
leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as Koppel appears to have secured his position at ABC, many
of the deans of the television anchor corps are leaving the scene. Bryant
Gumbel said last week he is walking away from his anchor job at CBS' "The
Early Show"; Mike Wallace was quoted Monday as saying he planned to
reduce his "60 Minutes" workload; and Cokie Roberts has announced she is
stepping down from ABC's "This Week."</TE>
<TE>   NBC, meanwhile, is wondering whether Tom Brokaw is next. Brokaw's
contract with the top-rated "NBC Nightly News" expires at the end of the
summer, and the anchor has been dropping hints for more than a year that
he might be ready to leave to spend more time in the outdoors and writing
books.</TE>
<TE>   NBC colleagues are getting increasingly antsy as Brokaw puts off a
decision, although if he does leave, he is still expected to maintain an
NBC News presence, most likely on the newsmagazine "Dateline." One reason
NBC executives are nervous is that Brokaw's decision is also expected to
affect Brian Williams, the MSNBC anchor who is Brokaw's heir apparent.
Williams' contract is up at the end of the year, and he is expected to
look elsewhere if Brokaw stays for the long term.</TE>
<TE>   Brokaw took a good chunk of last summer off to think about the future
and work on a book. Still, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
colleagues reported that he was energized by his work, and two weeks ago
he reported on rising Mideast tensions from Lebanon and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   An NBC News spokeswoman said, "Of course, we want Mr. Brokaw to stay
with NBC News," but otherwise declined to comment on private
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Nightline," Koppel said his schedule of anchoring three days
per week would remain, although he noted that this last year he anchored
on four days because of the amount of breaking news, and he was prepared
to do the same in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Adding that he also anchors a half-dozen weeklong series per year,
Koppel said, "The notion that I'm going into semi-retirement seems a
little excessive." Asked whether he had been prepared to leave the
network, as "Nightline" executives had told some outsiders was a
possibility, Koppel said, "It never came to that."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel said he doesn't know the status of a "Nightline" proposal to
expand into the half-hour slot now occupied by the controversial
discussion show "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher," whose fate
remains uncertain. "I'm just satisfied that the first half-hour will go
on and live on," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pair From Southland Win Prizes in the Arts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of this year's Pulitzer Prizes in arts categories--drama, music
and literature--were snagged by Southern Californians.</LD>
<LD>   The drama award went to a hot young playwright who has only recently
taken up residence in Venice, and the music award to a maverick
88-year-old composer who has lived and worked on his unusual "spatial
compositions" in Santa Barbara for 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   As a winner for her play "Topdog/Underdog," which opened Sunday night
at the Ambassador Theater in New York City, Suzan-Lori Parks, 38, becomes
the first African American woman to win the prize for drama.</LD>
<TE>   The playwright, who heads the A.S.K. Theater Projects Writing for
Performance Program at California Institute of the Arts, moved to Venice
about a year and a half ago with her husband, blues musician Paul Oscher.
Among her other current projects is "Hoopz," a Disney Theatricals stage
project about the Harlem Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   The prize for music went to Henry Brant for "Ice Field." The 20-minute
composition, which the composer describes as typical of his work, places
musicians not just onstage but also throughout the performance space. "In
balconies, and in boxes, in small groups, as soloists--each of these
groups throughout the hall has different music to play simultaneously,"
Brant said Monday from his home. "Ice Field" premiered in December at San
Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall with the San Francisco Philharmonic,
with the composer himself improvising at the pipe organ.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview from New York on Monday, playwright Parks said winning
a Pulitzer "feels great--we were just down at the theater, and it was
like a spontaneous party on the sidewalk. We had champagne, we were
hugging and dancing around, it was fun. It's just a joy."</TE>
<TE>   She downplayed the significance of her status as the first African
American woman to win a prize in drama. "That's what they're telling me,
so I guess it's true," said Parks, who was born in Fort Knox, Ky. She
added that she is gratified that her play, a family portrait of two
brothers named Lincoln and Booth--their father's little joke--is drawing
a crowd that includes all races and ages, from Broadway regulars to young
people "with their hats on backwards," experiencing theater for the first
time. "It's a wonderful day not just for me, but for all the people who
worked on 'Topdog/Underdog,' and for American theater," Parks said. "This
is not just a play about African American people, but it's a play that
includes everybody."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Brant is gratified to be recognized after 50 years of
composing outside the box. Born in Montreal, Brant moved with his family
to New York in 1929. There, he began to compose experimental music, but,
he said: "The Depression put a stop to that; you couldn't get an unusual
piece [performed] after that. It was only after World War II that it was
possible again to work along unusual lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I never expected that the kind of music that I write would win a
Pulitzer," he continued. "It's also an encouragement to me to continue
along these general lines. I hope to write some very large works, for big
choral groups, and big instrumental groups, with the addition of
ensembles from other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in favor of acoustic music, played live by living performers; in
my music I never use electronics or even amplification," he said. "It's
like a diet--organic is best."</TE>
<TE>   In the fiction category, Richard Russo, 52, surprised some among the
literati by winning the Pulitzer for his novel "Empire Falls" over
finalist Jonathan Franzen, author of "The Corrections." Franzen's novel,
the saga of a dysfunctional Midwestern family, won a National Book Award
in 2001 and gained some notoriety when author Franzen, instead of
expressing gratitude at being an Oprah Book Club selection, expressed
ambivalence at having the book club sticker attached to his book. (The
other fiction finalist was "John Henry Days" by Colson Whitehead.)</TE>
<TE>   Winner Russo called his prize "pretty remarkable. I've come to think
of ["Empire Falls"] as a snapshot of America at the end of the
millennium, or the beginning of a new millennium," he said. "When I
started out, it was this huge, wide canvas, but at heart it's really a
pretty simple story, a father-daughter story, born out of my thinking
about what kind of world my daughters would be facing, what dangers, and
what it would do to them."</TE>
<TE>   The history prize went to Louis Menand for "The Metaphysical Club: A
Story of Ideas in America," which the author calls an "intellectual
history from the Civil War to the first World War."</TE>
<TE>   "This is great--I think more people will feel that it's something
worth their attention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The prize for biography went to David McCullough for "John Adams." The
Pulitzer for general nonfiction went to Diane McWhorter for "Carry Me
Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights
Revolution," which explores the forces opposing civil rights in her
hometown. The poetry award went to Carl Dennis for "Practical Gods."</TE>

<HD>Church Blamed in Transfer of Priest</HD>
<DH>Religion: Boston officials knew of abuse charges but recommended
prelate to Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Although well aware of sexual abuse complaints against Father Paul
Shanley, Catholic Church officials here failed to disclose his history
when they approved his 1990 transfer to a Southern California parish,
documents released Monday show.</LD>
<LD>   On the contrary, a recommendation to the diocese of San Bernardino
described Shanley as "a priest in good standing."</LD>
<LD>   At an extraordinary 2 1/2-hour news conference, lawyers for a family
that has filed a civil lawsuit against Shanley displayed material from
his personnel file on a giant video screen. The papers showed that church
officials have known of sexual misconduct charges against the priest
since at least 1967. Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law also is named in the
suit.</LD>
<TE>   "They gave [Shanley] their seal of approval and shipped him out," said
Roderick MacLeish Jr., a lawyer representing 24-year-old Gregory Ford.
Ford has alleged that Shanley abused him over several years, starting
when he was 5 or 6.</TE>
<TE>   "He was taking children on youth retreats in San Bernardino, and the
archdiocese of Boston knew about it," MacLeish said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement that failed to mention Shanley, Boston archdiocese
spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey said Monday that "whatever may have
occurred in the past, there were no deliberate decisions to put children
at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, 71, now lives in San Diego. He was fired last week from his
post as a police department volunteer and, MacLeish said, "many people
are looking for him."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Shanley, first reported in the Boston Globe,
were the latest bombshell in a sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the
Catholic Church since early this year. Prosecutors here would not say
Monday whether Shanley's name was on a list of more than 80 priests
suspected of molesting children that Boston church officials provided
after the January conviction of former priest John J. Geoghan. Geoghan,
who has been accused of molesting more than 130 young people, is in
prison for groping a boy at a community swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Documents released in connection with Geoghan's prosecution showed
that the archdiocese knew about the child-molestation allegations against
him but did little more than transfer him from parish to parish. The
Geoghan case has sparked child-sex allegations in parishes around the
country and has led to the suspension or resignation of dozens of
priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Shanley documents displayed Monday revealed a similar pattern:
Although church leaders knew about sexual abuse accusations, they
continued to give the priest access to children in different parishes for
30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Vatican officials also were told as early as 1979 about statements
Shanley made on the topic of love between men and boys, the documents
show.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that Father Shanley is a troubled priest and I have tried
to be understanding and patient with him while continuously affirming
both privately to him and publicly to my people the church's teaching on
sexual ethics," then-Cardinal Humberto Medeiros wrote to Cardinal Franjo
Speer at the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley voiced his opinions at a 1979 conference in Boston that served
as the foundation for the North American Man Boy Love Assn., known as
NAMBLA.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Medeiros reassigned Shanley to St. John the Evangelist
Parish in Newton, Mass., just outside Boston.</TE>
<TE>   During his three-year tenure at St. Anne's parish in San Bernardino,
Shanley also operated an inn catering to gay customers in Palm Springs,
the Globe reported. Shanley was officially on sick leave from the Boston
archdiocese at that time and received his living expenses from the Boston
chancery--not the San Bernardino diocese.</TE>
<TE>   He later moved to New York, where he ran Leo House--a residential
facility that, in correspondence with the archdiocese here, Shanley
compared to the Ronald McDonald House for ill children.</TE>
<TE>   A nun working in New York with Shanley wrote to Law in 1995 to express
concerns about the priest's history and ongoing contact with minors.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I am with this time bomb," Sister Anne Carlin wrote. Displaying
the enlarged letter on his presentation screen, MacLeish said: "That was
an understatement."</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Law wrote Shanley expressing appreciation for his long
service and wishing him good health.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, however, the Boston cardinal wrote to his New York
counterpart, the late Cardinal John O'Connor, to acknowledge that "some
controversy from [Shanley's] past has followed him to New York."</TE>
<TE>   The landslide of information about Shanley was contained in 818 pages
of documents delivered to MacLeish on Friday by lawyers for the
archdiocese--two minutes before a court-ordered deadline was set to
expire.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish and Robert Sherman are representing Ford and his family.
Sherman said Monday that more than two dozen other people have brought
complaints to them about Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said he was abused by Shanley from 1983 to 1989, while the priest
was at St. John's. "I am very upset that a lot of people knew about him
and knew what he was doing," Ford said Monday. "It is my belief that he
molested hundreds over his 30-year reign of terror, and I hope he rots in
hell."</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, ordained in 1960, served as a "street priest" for the next
two decades. In Boston he established a ministry for runaways, drug
abusers, drifters and teens struggling with sexual identity.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his application to perform Mass and other sacramental
services in San Bernardino, Shanley was required to send a signed
affidavit attesting that he did not have a criminal record and had not
been accused of any improper sexual behavior, said the Rev. Howard
Lincoln, a spokesman for the San Bernardino archdiocese, on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln said Robert J. Banks, now the bishop of the Boston
archdiocese, sent a letter asserting that Shanley would be "of no
concern" to the Inland Empire parish.</TE>
<TE>   "It meant he had a good character and reputation," Lincoln said. "We
did not know and we did not doubt . . . the sincerity and genuineness of
Banks' letter. We relied on its correctness, its credibility and its
veracity."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Philip F. Straling--the former bishop of San Bernardino who
approved Shanley's application to perform services there--did not return
telephone calls Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, police spokesman Dave Cohen said officials decided last
week to drop Shanley from the department's Retired Senior Volunteer
Patrol as a result of allegations surfacing in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "The department determined it did not in any way want to be involved
in what was going on," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior volunteers help direct traffic, visit shut-ins and make
vacation checks. The volunteers always work in pairs, Cohen said.
Although some volunteers work with children, Shanley was not one of
those, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said Shanley told Police Department colleagues that he currently
is traveling. His termination notice was delivered via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar over clerical sexual abuse continues to batter the highest
church authorities in this country.</TE>
<TE>   During his presentation Monday, MacLeish charged that "Cardinal Law
quite literally protected Paul Shanley." This country's senior Catholic
prelate, Law has failed on three occasions to appear for scheduled
depositions in the case. MacLeish said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the suffering that has taken place at the hands of Paul
Shanley, a serial child molester for four decades--three of them in
Boston," MacLeish said, "none of it had to happen."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Won't Charge Citizen Caught in Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Justice Department officials have decided not to charge the
American-born prisoner who was transferred from a U.S. military prison in
Cuba to Norfolk, Va., last week, concluding that U.S. prosecutors lack
enough incriminating information, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   That leaves the detainee, Yaser Esam Hamdi, 22, in legal limbo as
government lawyers try to determine whether there is a way to charge him
under U.S. military law. Another option is to turn him over to
authorities in Saudi Arabia, where he has lived most of his life,
government officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Hamdi was captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan five months ago while
fighting for either Al Qaeda or the Taliban, and since then he has told
interrogators he was born in Louisiana. Federal agents recently located
his birth certificate in Baton Rouge, and last week authorities flew him
to the Norfolk Naval Base.</LD>
<TE>   International lawyers said the fact that Hamdi is a U.S. citizen
grants him a number of rights not available to the 299 detainees still
held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base--and limits the U.S. government's
ability to hold him. Government officials did not describe the legal
basis they would cite for detaining a U.S. citizen who has not been
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news
conference Monday that military officials are deliberating how to handle
Hamdi's case.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi cannot be tried before a military commission or tribunal because
those panels are restricted to noncitizens.</TE>

<HD>Honeymoon Is Over for LaCour</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three summers ago, Matt LaCour revealed all anyone needed to know
about character, commitment and maturity.</LD>
<LD>   He was coaching Chatsworth High's American Legion baseball team.
He was 25 and hoping to impress some high school principal, trying to
show that he could be a successful head coach.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth qualified for the World Series in Middletown, Conn.
LaCour chose not to go.</LD>
<TE>   Why would he pass on the coaching opportunity of a lifetime?</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take much thinking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   LaCour loved coaching, but he loved his fiancee more. His wedding
and honeymoon in Italy had been planned for months. There would be no
postponement.</TE>
<TE>   "The players had a good time with the dilemma I was in," LaCour
said. "But there was no other choice to make. Baseball takes a
precedence in our lives, but that one week it had to take a back
seat."</TE>
<TE>   LaCour finally got his head coaching position last summer at
four-time City champion Woodland Hills El Camino Real. He's 28,
happily married, has a 1-year-old daughter and is passing along life
lessons to a Conquistador team that is 14-2 and has won 13
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   This is the week LaCour might feel more nervous than he did during
his wedding week. El Camino Real is scheduled to play unbeaten
Chatsworth (16-0), his alma mater, on Wednesday at Chatsworth, if the
City Section allows it. The school bus drivers' strike already forced
cancellation of Monday's first meeting between the schools and is
causing frustration levels to rise.</TE>
<TE>   "We're willing to play the game in my backyard," Chatsworth
Athletic Director Fluke Fluker said. "We're fuming. We might be the
No. 1 team in the nation and we can't play."</TE>
<TE>   LaCour was Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn's top assistant for four
years. They are like brothers and still talk three or four times a
week.</TE>
<TE>   The schools have combined to win seven City championships since
1990. Anytime they play, it's a playoff atmosphere. Putting LaCour
and Meusborn on opposite sides only adds to the intrigue.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Coach Meusborn are pretty intense guys and I expect our
teams to play pretty intense," LaCour said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Meusborn: "I think Matt has them back on track. I'm already
impressed."</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth's players didn't want to lose LaCour, especially to
their West Valley League rivals, but they're happy for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, 'You traitor,'" pitcher Justin Cassel said. "But I
think it's good for him to come out of Coach Meusborn's shadow and
establish himself as a great coach. But we still want to whip him."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone knows how to beat ace left-hander Joe Guntz, who's 30-0
lifetime, it should be LaCour. He was Chatsworth's pitching coach and
called all the pitches for Guntz last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He claims he knows everything about me," Guntz said, "but I have
an extra trick up my sleeve."</TE>
<TE>   Said LaCour: "I don't think I have any particular advantage. It's
not a matter of his physical stuff that allows him to win 30 games in
a row. It's his mental outlook. You're not going to faze him. You
have to execute."</TE>
<TE>   Having LaCour and Meusborn on opposite sides has created vigorous
competition. Neither will back down in trying to top the other.
Chatsworth got a new $36,000 scoreboard this year, and El Camino Real
plans to add a similar one next season.</TE>
<TE>   Meusborn spends hours making sure his field is immaculate, with
the infield grass almost as fine as that of a putting green. LaCour
spends even more time dragging his infield and cutting grass, trying
to make it equal to Chatsworth's.</TE>
<TE>   "He grooms that field like he does his hair," El Camino Real track
coach Vic Lepisto said. "We don't know how his wife puts up with
him."</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that the time LaCour and Meusborn spent together was
good for both. LaCour learned how to build a top program, how to
raise funds for special projects, how to be organized and make tough
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   LaCour taught Meusborn how to relate better to his players and
calmed his fears about players not performing well in games if they
don't practice perfect.</TE>
<TE>   They were a tough combination to beat, one that helped Chatsworth
make it to the finals at Dodger Stadium three times in four years,
winning twice.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's the pupil taking on the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be intense on the field and may get ugly once in a
while, but it's not personal," LaCour said. "It's baseball. I'm never
going to be as stone-faced as Coach Meusborn. I think I got him a
little fired up and he calmed me a little down."</TE>
<TE>   El Camino Real and Chatsworth have learned not to put too much
emphasis on their league meetings, because the schools have ended
their season four times playing each other for the City title.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a great dream," Guntz said of a fifth meeting.</TE>
<TE>   LaCour has no out-of-town trips planned for June 4.</TE>

<HD>4 Ex-Employees Are Sentenced for Fraud in Car Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four former employees of Gunderson Chevrolet in El Monte, who were
charged with planting hidden costs in the sales contracts of more
than 1,000 car buyers, were sentenced Monday after pleading no
contest to fraud-related charges, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The four former employees, along with three others, were indicted
last year after a yearlong investigation by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office and California Department of Motor
Vehicles into the dealership, which has since changed management and
its name.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators found that employees overcharged customers for
products and services and changed the terms of deals without
customers' knowledge, cheating them out of as much as $6,000 each,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey McGrath.</LD>
<TE>   In the most frequent scam, he said, customers were charged up to
$3,000 for a theft protection system that cost the dealer $37, and
the extra fees were buried in the monthly payments. In other cases,
customers of Gunderson, the state's largest Chevrolet dealership,
were confused into thinking they had bought a vehicle when they were
leasing it, McGrath said. The fraud was committed from early 1999
until May 2000, according to the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   The dealership's general manager, James Michael Hoban, pleaded no
contest to conspiring to make untrue or misleading statements in the
sale of cars. Hoban, 46, of Irvine, was sentenced to six months in
jail, placed on five years' probation and ordered to pay a fine and
perform community service.</TE>
<TE>   Former finance director Michele Davis, 56, of Norco pleaded no
contest to the same felony charge and also received six months in
jail and five years' probation. Randolph Samuel Cooper, 37, of
Irvine, a former used car manager, pleaded no contest to a
misdemeanor charge of making untrue or misleading statements in the
sale of a car and was fined and sentenced to three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Poteete, 57, of San Marino, a former finance manager,
pleaded no contest to conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to
three years in prison, which was suspended, and six months in jail,
McGrath said. Poteete also was fined and ordered to perform community
service. He received the most serious sentence because he had the
most direct contact with victims, McGrath said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoban, Davis and Poteete were ordered to surrender their auto
sales licenses and will be allowed to serve their jail terms through
an electronic monitoring program.</TE>
<TE>   In February, former finance manager Patrick Fisher was sentenced

pleading guilty and cooperating with prosecutors.</TE>

awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   The dealership, which is owned by AutoNation of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., is now called Chevrolet of El Monte. Oscar Suris, a spokesman,
said the company had cooperated with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   AutoNation has paid about $2.8 million in penalties and
restitution to resolve a civil case filed by the district attorney's
office and the DMV, McGrath said.</TE>
