<HD>Who's Tour Is On</HD>
<DH>Despite the unexpected death Thursday of founding bassist
John Entwistle, the concerts will start Monday at the Hollywood Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying it's better to mourn a fellow musician on stage than in
private, the surviving members of the Who announced Friday that they
will move forward with a U.S. tour despite the death this week of
bassist John Entwistle. The first show will be at the Hollywood Bowl
on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going on," guitarist Pete Townshend said Friday via a
short statement posted on his Web site. "First show Hollywood Bowl.
Pray for us John, wherever you are."</LD>
<LD>   The decision to tour marked a dramatic reversal: In the hours
after Entwistle was found dead Thursday in a Las Vegas hotel room,
promoters for the Who tour were decisive in announcing that the road
reunion would be canceled. Less than 24 hours later, though, the tour
was reinstated with only two missed shows: the kick-off Las Vegas
performance that had been scheduled for Friday night and the show
that had been planned tonight at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.
Those shows will be rescheduled.</LD>
<TE>   Longtime Who manager Bill Curbishley said Fridaythat the band's
tour will proceed "as a tribute to John Entwistle and to the loss of
an irreplaceable friend."</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Andy Hewitt said it flashed through his mind Friday that
some observers might consider it crass for the band to tour so soon
after the death of a founding member.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about that for a moment, yes," Hewitt said. "But
whatever the band feels is appropriate is appropriate. And they feel
strongly about this. What we've heard from Pete Townshend is that he
could either mourn alone in his room or on stage, and from that
standpoint, it makes perfect sense."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt said plans were still pending Friday for Entwistle's
funeral services.</TE>
<TE>   The Monday performance at the Hollywood Bowl will almost certainly
be charged with intense emotion as the seminal British Invasion band
performs for the first time with its original membership reduced to
two, Townshend and lead singer Roger Daltrey. Drummer Keith Moon died
in 1978 of drug overdose.</TE>
<TE>   The band broke up for seven years in the 1980s, then reunited
through the years in sporadic fashion for reunion and "farewell"
tours, but the success of recent ventures had warmed the band's often
frosty internal politics to the point that the group planned to
record together again, their first studio foray since 1982. It's
unknown what effect Entwistle's death will have.</TE>
<TE>   It was also not clear Friday who would play bass for the band on
Monday night or beyond, although the name circulating among Who
insiders is veteran session man Pino Palladino. The drummer for the
tour is Zak Starkey, son of the former Beatle drummer Ringo Starr.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Entwistle at age 57, apparently of a heart attack,
saps the Who of a vital component of their signature sound, which in
the 1960s and 1970s was hailed as a brawny, musically ambitious brand
of rock.</TE>
<TE>   Moon's thunderous and adventurous drumming style and Entwistle's
innovative expansion of the bassist role combined with Townshend's
playing and songwriting and Daltrey's caterwauling vocals to make the
Who a band that for a time vied with the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the
Rolling Stones as the most relevant rock voice of youth. The band is
best known for its rock opera "Tommy" and songs such as "My
Generation," "Won't Get Fooled Again" and "Pinball Wizard."
Entwistle's almost comically rigid stage presence amid the frenetic
performances of his bandmates often made him appear a disinterested
tourist amid rock chaos, but fellow musicians hailed him as true
innovator and masterful player. At the height of the Who's powers, he
was routinely cited as the best bass player in rock.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unique and irreplaceable," was the appraisal Friday by
Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. "I am shocked and devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle apparently died in his sleep Thursday morning, just
hours after he and his bandmates rehearsed. A tour assistant
discovered his body in his room at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino,
the resort that was to have hosted the first show on the reunion
tour.</TE>
<TE>   The resort, which has a motif that celebrates classic rock heroes
and memorabilia, has become the site of fan shrine to Entwistle. Many
of the small tributes are addressed to "Ox," the affectionate
nickname for the bass player who performed like a taciturn beast of
burden, and others cite Entwistle additions to the Who songbook, such
as the macabre "Boris the Spider" and "The Quiet One."</TE>
<TE>   Details about the rescheduling of the shows in Irvine and Las
Vegas are expected in upcoming weeks, and fans are directed to hold
onto their tickets. Refunds will also be available at the point of
purchase. On Friday, there were tickets still available for the
Hollywood Bowl show on Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   A film tribute to the Who previously scheduled for Sunday at
Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood has been converted into a
memorial event for Entwistle. "The Kids Are Alright," "Tommy" and
"Listening to You" will be screened at the event, which begins at
2:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle, who had been married twice, is survived by one child,
Christopher Entwistle. The statement released Friday by band manager
Curbishley quoted the musician's son as being a proponent of mounting
the Who tour.</TE>
<TE>   "He lived for music and will always live within the Who's music,"
Christopher Entwistle said in the statement. "This is what he would
have wished and our love goes out to the remaining band members and
the entourage that makes up the Who family."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>China's Wu Haiyan says performing with the best dancers in the world
was as great an honor as the gold medal she received in USA
International Ballet Competition.</LD>
<LD>   Wu was awarded the medal in the senior women's division on Friday.
The competition is to close Sunday with a performance by medal
winners.</LD>
<LD>   The event is the United States' official international ballet
competition. The two-week competition is held every four years in
Jackson. About 100 dancers from 24 countries competed this year.</LD>
<TE>   Wu, 23, performs with the Central Ballet in Beijing, also known as
the National Ballet. She has been dancing since she was 10.</TE>
<TE>   American dancer Joseph Phillips, a native of Columbia, S.C., took
the gold in the men's junior division. Phillips, a 16-year-old
student at the North Carolina School for the Arts, said he plans to
pursue a career in classical ballet.</TE>
<TE>   No gold medals were awarded in the men's senior or women's junior
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Marks, chairman of the international jury, said gold medals
are not always awarded because dancers are judged on international
standards. "We are comparing these youngsters to the best dancers
around," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Medalists in each of four divisions receive cash prizes, Marks
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also receiving medals in the women's senior division were Sarah
Lamb of Boston, representing the U.S. (silver) and Katia Carranza of
Mexico (bronze).</TE>
<TE>   Other medalists in the men's junior division were Danny Tidwell of
New York City, representing the U.S. (silver), Yudai Fukuoka of Japan
and Jiao Yang of China (bronze).</TE>
<TE>   Medalists in the men's senior division were Li Jun of China
(silver) and Mikhail Ilyin of Russia (bronze); and in the women's
junior division: Sarah Kathryn Lane of Rochester, N.Y., representing
the U.S. (silver) and Sang Yi Han of South Korea (bronze).</TE>

<LD>Ladies: The Santa Barbara Bowl feels your pain. When nature calls,
you won't have to stand in line for hours or hold the men's room
hostage.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a $22-million renovation campaign, management at the
66-year-old amphitheater has created what it calls the largest
ladies' room in Santa Barbara County--a 45-stall affair that
eliminates porta-potties and puts the old six-stall facility to
shame. It's a boon to women constantly checking their watches during
all-too-short intermissions.</LD>
<LD>   To celebrate, the arena has organized a July 13 cocktail party
($50 a ticket) to be held backstage and in the 1,700-square-foot
ladies' room--for women only. "Babes at the Bowl" will include tarot
readings, handwriting analysis and makeovers--and vodka concoctions
such as "The Royal Flush" and "The Tidy Bowl" served by male board
members. Reservations: (805) 560-0895.</LD>
<TE>   "The biggest complaint at the Bowl was the lack of bathrooms,"
said publicist Mo McFadden. "Sam Scranton, executive director of the
facility, says this will help us. Now we can serve more beer."</TE>

<HD>The Star That Got Away: Judy Remembered</HD>
<DH>A private memorabilia collection and never before exhibited
photos trace Garland's career in a showing at the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no ruby slippers--those are at the Smithsonian, after all.
But for the Judy Garland fan, there's still a rainbow full of
never-before-seen treasures at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum.</LD>
<LD>   The new exhibit, "Judy Garland: Princess of Oz," pays tribute to
the actress and singer with a collection of photos by celebrity
shutterbug Milton Greene, sheet music, posters, lobby cards and
magazines.</LD>
<LD>   Garland, perhaps still most famous for playing Dorothy in the 1939
film "The Wizard of Oz," would have turned 80 on June 10 but died at
age 47 in 1969. Just as with Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Elvis
Presley--other entertainers whose lives were cut short--Garland's
legacy and popularity seem to grow with successive generations.</LD>
<TE>   "With Marilyn, it was generally the culture that you can blame"
for her tragic life, says Christopher Horak, curator at the Hollywood
Entertainment Museum. "They commodified her and turned her into an
object and sold her. With Judy, we know that at a very early age when
she was at MGM they were feeding her drugs. She became an alcoholic.
I think, ultimately, that led to her early demise."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the items came from one collector, Tom Boghossian, but
it's the Greene photographs that bring the screen legend to life.
Donated for use by his son, Josh Greene, are 20 pictures taken in the
fall of 1951 during Garland's comeback concert engagement at the
Palace in New York City, and others from 1963-64 when she starred in
her short-lived CBS variety series, "The Judy Garland Show." Neither
set of photographs has been published or exhibited before.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some backstage stuff that's really interesting, and the
portraits are not what you usually expect," says Horak. "There are
moments in the '60s photos where she looks like she was 22 again."</TE>
<TE>   There are also several non-Greene photos, including a 1943 picture
of Garland entertaining U.S. soldiers during World War II, a 1953
wardrobe test for "A Star Is Born" and other portraits.</TE>
<TE>   The movie posters and lobby cards featured in the three-month
exhibition span her career, from the 1930s at MGM to her final film,
1963's "I Could Go on Singing." (That rare poster is, in fact, from
Germany.) "There's also a weird Argentine poster from 'Girl Crazy,' "
Horak notes, "and a beautiful complete set of lobby cards from 'A
Star Is Born.' It's pretty rare to find a complete set. They are
really striking."</TE>
<TE>   The periodical covers and feature stories included in the exhibit
hail from Life, Look, Cine Revue and Cinemonde magazines. The 10
pieces of classic sheet music include her hits "Over the Rainbow"
from "The Wizard of Oz" and "The Man That Got Away" from 1954's "A
Star Is Born."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Judy Garland: Princess of Oz," at the Hollywood Entertainment
Museum, 7021 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, through Sept. 2. Hours are
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Admission is $8.75 for adults; $5.50 for
seniors; $4.50 for students; $4 for ages 5-12; free to museum members
and kids younger than 5. (323) 465-7900.</TE>

<HD>For Tosti, the Zoot Suit Still Fits</HD>
<DH>The bandleader who helped spark a craze in the '40s still
loves fusion. The pachuco era's sounds are on a CD for the first
time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Old pachucos never die. They just move to Palm Springs and keep the
memories alive.</LD>
<LD>   Bandleader Don Tosti, the man who helped spark a Mexican American
musical craze with his 1948 tune "Pachuco Boogie," lives in a tidy
home off Palm Canyon Drive with his pet Chihuahua, named Cacahuate
(Peanut). Widowed for many years, the musician dotes on the dog,
which he keeps in a comfy baby pen surrounded by stuffed animals.</LD>
<LD>   Tosti no longer wears a zoot suit, the baggy garb that symbolized
the rebelliousness and vitality of a generation of Mexican American
youth in the '40s and early '50s. But that doesn't mean he can't cut
a colorful figure still.</LD>
<TE>   During a recent hot afternoon, he emerged from his home wearing a
guayabera, red shorts, matching red socks pulled up to his knees and
white patent-leather loafers. He started swearing almost from the
first sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," he says, listening to his famous song in a visitor's
car on the way to lunch, "I wrote this [junk] 54 years ago. That's me
doing the rap. Orale! I'm a pachuco."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like he still gets a kick from his work.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," says Tosti, 79. "I'm way ahead of my time."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the music that defined the pachuco era is
available on CD in a compilation that borrows the title of Tosti's
trend-setting hit, "Pachuco Boogie." The collection of 21 historic
tracks, released on Arhoolie Records, was recorded mostly in Los
Angeles between 1948 and 1954, several restored from the original 78
rpm discs.</TE>
<TE>   Many will recall the exciting, finger-popping spirit of the music
from the soundtrack to "Zoot Suit," the 1978 play by Luis Valdez that
explored the persecution of pachucos and their emerging culture
during World War II. Treated as traitors and undesirables, the
Mexican American youth were assaulted by sailors during race riots
fanned by the sensationalist Hearst press.</TE>
<TE>   The play featured one track included in the compilation, "Los
Chucos Suaves," a tropical tune done Mexican-style by Chicano
singer-songwriter Lalo Guerrero, who coincidentally also lives in the
Palm Springs area.</TE>
<TE>   This is fusion music before the term was invented. It's a blend of
the popular styles of the day--swing, boogie-woogie and jump
blues--with mambo rhythms and a Mexican touch. Because the lyrics are
in Spanish, spiced with the lively, hep-cat brand of pachuco slang
called calo, some consider Pachuco music a precursor of today's rock
en espanol.</TE>
<TE>   Although caught in a cultural war, pachucos were the first wave of
Mexican Americans to embrace American pop culture and make it their
own. They eschewed old-fashioned Mexican music and absorbed the
sounds reverberating in their urban barrios.</TE>
<TE>   "They were rappers, in a way," says Chris Strachwitz, Arhoolie's
president who produced the pachuco compilation. "Half of it is
talking, and all in this low-life lingo. It was street music, you
know. It's the first time that the low-lifers really rose to
popularity, and people frowned on them: 'Oh, those loafers!' "</TE>
<TE>   Strachwitz's unique collection of Mexican music, including 14,000
78s dating to before the country's revolution began in 1910, has
served as a basis for other historic Arhoolie compilations, such as
the series on Tex-Mex border music. For the pachuco retrospective, he
teamed with Bay Area DJ Chuy Varela, who wrote the liner notes and
contributed some of the selections from his own shellac collection.</TE>
<TE>   "The music swings with a raw sense of improvisation," Varela
wrote. "The sound of the Pachuco Boogie Boys--Raul Diaz scatting like
a jazz singer, [Bob] Hernandez blowing [sax] like a Chicano Lester
Young, Tosti walking the bass like his hero, Jimmy
Blanton--demonstrated the affection they had developed for swing and
jazz music."</TE>
<TE>   The Boogie Boys also included the "stellar" piano of Eddie Cano, a
standout Latin jazz pianist from East L.A.</TE>
<TE>   But not all Latinos were impressed at the time. Like their Anglo
counterparts, conservatives in the Mexican American community
expressed contempt for the pachuco lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Their distaste is documented in the compilation through tunes like
"Los Pachucos," a corrido by Las Hermanas Mendoza. The song condemns
the young zoot-suiters for their alleged laziness, comparing them to
crows, "so elegant in suspenders and slacks, who don't know how to
work, but they know how to dance."</TE>
<TE>   Lazy is the last thing you could call Don Tosti, whose real name
is Edmundo Martinez Tostado. He was born in a tough barrio of El
Paso, where the pachuco craze started. He never knew his father and
was raised primarily by his grandparents and aunts. (Although, his
hits were recorded under his father's name, Don Ramon Sr., because a
musician unions strike prevented the Boogie Boys from working under
their real names.)</TE>
<TE>   Tosti was always getting into fights as a kid, so he was forced to
study music to stay out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 10, he was playing violin with the El Paso
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire knowledge, intelligence, ability," he says. "You only
acquire them from studying and practicing."</TE>
<TE>   He also studied piano but had to give it up because of an injury.
In a fight over a girl, an assailant tried to stab him with a dagger,
which he grabbed in self-defense, slicing the tendons between his
thumb and index finger.</TE>
<TE>   The blood scared the other boy and he ran, recalls Tosti, whose
scars are still visible.</TE>
<TE>   "That's life," shrugs the musician, who went on to learn clarinet,
sax and string bass.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tosti says great musicians don't need to brag, he does
his fair share. He was one of the few Mexican Americans to play with
the famed big bands, performing with Jack Teagarden, Les Brown and
Jimmy Dorsey, who was best man at his first wedding in 1948. Tosti
also recorded with Perez Prado on the classic "Voodoo Suite."</TE>
<TE>   He may be a bit cranky, but Tosti is also sentimental.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the restaurant on Palm Canyon Drive, he pulls out his
wallet to show a laminated photo of Cacahuatita, that little
Chihuahua he left at home alone.</TE>
<TE>   At the corner, he can't disguise his pride in pointing out his
star on Palm Springs' version of the Walk of Fame, acknowledging his
work as bandleader and composer.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get it because I'm Mexican," huffs Tosti, who still
works as a music teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Tosti, a huge Tito Puente fan, is proud of his jazz credentials.</TE>
<TE>   As for his pachuco records, he admits he did that for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, he produces a photocopy of the $2,000 royalty check,
enlarged as a keepsake, that he received as an advance from Arhoolie
for the new compilation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very flattered," he says of the tribute to his pachuco era.
"But I've outgrown it."</TE>

<LD>We're writing to contest--to put it mildly--the opening comment in
Dean Kuipers' piece, "All That Young Jazz" (June 20), that Leimert
Park's World Stage died in the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Not only did the Stage grow considerably in the 1990s, offering
many opportunities to artists of all ages, but it continues to
present a wide range of programs, despite the passings of key
participants Billy Higgins and Horace Tapscott.</LD>
<LD>   The error does a disservice to the music's history in this city
and to young artists in search of a nurturing, creative environment.</LD>

<TE>   I would like to inform Dean Kuipers and your readers that the
Young Artist Jazz Series has been going strong for more than six
years. One Monday night a month, young musicians are showcased at
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, L.A.'s premiere jazz club.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being an exciting performance opportunity, this series
provides a venue for the young artists to support and network with
each other. Many great collaborations were born through this program.
Although it isn't a specific club where the musicians can hang out
regularly, it is still an integral part of the young jazz artist
community.</TE>

<TE>   I've been a jazz fan ever since I discovered Dixieland in high
school. My taste touched down on R&amp;B and the Harlem Hit Parade,
through Jazz at the Philharmonic and into West Coast cool. I
continued to listen to that music, but jazz has never been popular
and I doubt that it ever will.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of people want to hear melodies. A catchy tune
properly presented will be played again and again, until it palls.
Beyond that, people want to hear songs sung, preferably by someone
attractive.</TE>
<TE>   There are many of us who leave our radios tuned to the jazz
stations wherever we go, but lack of a scene isn't limited to Los
Angeles. Here in San Diego, a jazz fan has a difficult time keeping
track of such major talents as Hollis Gentry, Peter Sprague and Holly
Hoffman. They don't appear in concerts at Qualcomm Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   'Twas ever thus. Unless there's a major overhaul of the human
psyche, young jazz artists will always have to 'shed, waiting for the
public to catch up.</TE>

<LD>After all these years on the air, Bill Maher still doesn't understand
what made his show tick ("Bill Maher Wraps Up a Few Thoughts," by
Paul Brownfield, June 22). It's not that viewers wish to hear him
extrapolate on politics and news events, it's the disparate mix of
celebrities and thinkers who have opinions we wouldn't otherwise get
to hear. I'll take Carrot Top's amusing musings about the presidency
any day over Maher's angry and sexist comments.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, the problem with "Politically Incorrect" is that it became
an escalating excuse for its host's rudeness. He won't be missed but
perhaps someone will reorganize the idea of having clever people
sitting around and gabbing. "The View" makes the attempt but is still
a project-plugging program.</LD>

<HD>A 'Loopy Notion'?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his review of "The Smith Family," Howard Rosenberg says that the
documentary "refutes [Mormon] church doctrine about homosexuality and
the loopy notion of it being a changeable 'lifestyle' " (" 'POV' Has
Vision to Focus on an Ordinary Family's Strength," June 24).</LD>
<LD>   Let me see now. The documentary is about a man who cheats on his
wife, sentences her to death by infecting her with HIV, becomes "a
living cadaver" after developing AIDS and destroys his family before
dying. This refutes church doctrine about homosexuality? It is
"loopy" to urge such a person to change?</LD>
<LD>   Steve Smith clearly had some choices to make that were not
inherent or unchangeable. He had a temporarily committed, apparently
loving, appropriately sexual relationship with his wife that produced
two sons. What would have been the worst for him had he chosen to
continue that relationship? Sexual frustration, maybe, which has
never killed anyone. Might he have continued to be attracted to men?
It seems likely. Did he have to act on that attraction? No.</LD>
<TE>   If human beings cannot control sexual attraction, we have no right
to find fault with child abusers.</TE>

<LD>Thank you, Joe McNally. I walked, crying, from 9-foot photo to 9-foot
photo at the "Faces of Ground Zero" exhibit at the Skirball Museum
("N.Y.'s State of Mind," by Scarlet Cheng, June 20). The men and
women of Sept. 11 are more than moving, they are haunting.</LD>
<LD>   The pictures are larger-than-life reminders of rescuers who
committed unfathomable acts of heroism, comrades and family members
of those who did not make it. It is more than Polaroid patriotism,
more than instant Americana; it is the essence of what people will do
for each other, as a matter of course, what they will do for total
strangers.</LD>
<LD>   "Faces of Ground Zero" is an example of the best humanity has to
offer.</LD>

<LD>Thank you for that informative expose on how to get into L.A.'s most
discerning clubs ("Wearing Their Welcome," by Louise Roug, June 27).
Now I have the tools so that maybe, finally, one of those
minimum-wage thugs who probably can't spell his own name will pick
me--ME!--to go inside. At last I'll be among the shallowest Los
Angeles has to offer. Oh, how I've prayed for some kind of validation
from--well, I don't know who they are, but I'm sure they're all
cooler than me. They must be. They guard the door.</LD>

<LD>Rex Bell is certainly within his rights to sell the collection of his
mother, Clara Bow, rather than donate it to a research library, but
it was disheartening to read that his decision appears to be based on
a misunderstanding about the work we do at our library ("Memories of
a Glamorous Age," by Susan King, June 26).</LD>
<LD>   For the record, Bell has never visited our library, nor has he
donated any items to us. Had he visited he would have seen how
dedicated our staff is to preserving written and visual materials on
all aspects of film history, to performing special conservation work
on our unique holdings, and to making our collections available for
study under extremely secure conditions.</LD>
<LD>   Clara Bow is a pivotal figure in film history, and this collection
would have been invaluable to scholars and historians had it been
placed in an appropriate research facility. It would be nice to
think, as Bell stated, that the "people who are interested in
purchasing this stuff are going to take care of it," but whether or
not the buyers preserve particular items, the true value of the
collection will forever be lost once the items are scattered among
individual collectors.</LD>

<LD>Critic Chris Pasles' suggestion that the popularity of women's choirs
was more anchored in archaic 19th century Victorian values, and thus
has created a "problem of repertory" for contemporary women's
choruses, is quaintly and patently wrong ("Vox Femina Finds an
Accessible Choral Avenue," June 24). There is a vast literature for
women's chorus, written especially for women, spanning centuries.</LD>
<LD>   However, Pasles' review illuminates the image problem that women's
choruses often face, namely that women, singing together, are somehow
viewed as Victorian: prim, sexless, humorless, quaint ladies' tea
aficionadas, with a literature of ditties. Having myself written a
Requiem for women's chorus and another celebrating the vagina, I can
tell you that the women's chorus repertory has many pieces with grit,
wit, bold messages, complexity and diversity.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the notion that women singing together and being erotic
together (as singing together definitely is, and Vox Femina certainly
demonstrated) is slightly disquieting to the general audience. It is
their loss.</LD>

<LD>The pairing of singer-songwriters Nanci Griffith and Richard Thompson
on Thursday at the House of Blues in Anaheim gave an object lesson on
the yin and yang of adult folk rock.</LD>
<LD>   Griffith embodied all the empathy, liberal politics and effusive
sharing of emotion that's a key part of the folk tradition. With the
always tasteful backing of her five-piece Blue Moon Orchestra, she
offered song after song exploring humanity's nobler qualities.</LD>
<LD>   As the evening's yang man, Thompson preceded Griffith in a solo
set, accompanying himself--magnificently--on acoustic guitar,
spitting out lyrics that chafe at human frailty or revel in the
darkness lurking deep in the human soul.</LD>
<TE>   Guess whose performance was more captivating.</TE>
<TE>   For all her good intentions and support of worthy causes, Griffith
often gets bogged down in the chatty setups to her songs, forgetting
the value of letting a good lyric speak for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson offered an acerbic comment here, a wry observation there
during his hour set, but mostly let his music do the talking--or, in
many cases, scowling, hurting and yearning.</TE>
<TE>   Both have gone some time without new albums: Griffith drew
generously from last year's "Clock Without Hands" and is preparing a
live album for the fall; Thompson dropped in a couple of numbers from
an in-progress album and a couple from his 3-year-old "Mock Tudor" as
he hopscotched through an impressively deep repertoire whose quality
shows no signs of letting up.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith brought Thompson out for a duet on the old Richard and
Linda Thompson number "Wall of Death" toward the end of her 90-minute
set.</TE>
<TE>   With just his acoustic guitar, Thompson zapped her set with some
electricity missing earlier.</TE>

<HD>Landscape Paintings' Vitality Is as Big as All Outdoors</HD>
<DH>Art* American works depicted the birth of a nation and
helped inspire creation of national parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE LUCEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Covered with rolling green hills, jagged mountains, crashing
waterfalls and ominous gray clouds, the massive landscape paintings
now on exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts truly
embody everything Edmund Burke captured in his treatise "On the
Sublime and Beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   In the work, the 18th century Irish intellectual defined sublime
as huge, powerful, rough and ultimately frightening.</LD>
<LD>   The Philadelphia show "American Sublime" features work from 10
American artists that was created between 1820 and 1880. The nearly
100 paintings are large in scale and scope. Huge canvases are all but
overwhelmed by the big, glowing combinations of sea, earth and sky.
The exhibit, the first to collect so many artists of the period, was
coordinated by two British curators and originated in London at the
Tate Britain, where it received rave reviews. The show is on view in
Philadelphia through Aug. 25 and then goes to the Minneapolis
Institute of Arts.</LD>
<TE>   Kim Sajet, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts' deputy
director, said the works broke from European traditions. "They didn't
have the ruins, the medieval castles," she said. "Everything was
untreated, unspoiled ... this idea of the birth of a new nation."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first, "A View of the Mountain Pass Called the Notch of
the White Mountains," was painted by Thomas Cole in 1839. It shows
autumnal forested land in front of a huge mountain, with a tiny white
house against the trees.</TE>
<TE>   In the foreground, chopped-down tree trunks show the influence of
humans, Sajet said. However, she added, in the upper-left-hand corner
heavy gray clouds are collecting, signifying the awesome power of
nature.</TE>
<TE>   This conflict between human beings and the wilderness appears
throughout the works.</TE>
<TE>   Further along, we see Frederic Edwin Church's panoramic painting
of Niagara Falls, done in 1857. The long, narrow piece re-creates the
turquoise and white water pounding over the rocks with a tiny row of
trees and houses on the other side in the far distance.</TE>
<TE>   Sajet said this, like other landscapes, was meant to be hung low
and the viewer would have stood close to feel as though he or she
were in the painting.</TE>
<TE>   "You're standing at the precipice, ready to go over," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings are arranged to show the evolution of landscape art
and the nation. The first section is titled "Wilderness," and the
last is called "The Great West," for the final expanse of untouched
land.</TE>
<TE>   These works have been largely overlooked for years, Sajet said,
because landscape painting was no longer popular in Europe at the
time. European artists had finished with landscapes and were moving
toward Impressionism; they saw these paintings as old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the art establishment continued to ignore this
period. Most thought American art didn't become relevant until the
20th century with artists such as Jackson Pollock, said museum
spokeswoman Hilary Pitts.</TE>
<TE>   The final selections of the exhibit show the mountains of the
West. The last painting is Thomas Moran's "Grand Canyon of the
Colorado." The rough, red-tipped rocks are visible far into the
distance, under a tiny strip of sky.</TE>
<TE>   This and other paintings helped persuade Congress to create
national parks, Sajet said. "Congress did not see the places, they
saw the paintings."</TE>

<HD>Suburbia, Mystified</HD>
<DH>Gregory Crewdson says his work, at Gagosian, is 'all about
crating your own world.... It feels familiar and ordinary, but I like
to defamiliarize it.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MANTELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If ever a gallery artist were ripe for defection to Hollywood, New
York photographer Gregory Crewdson is the one. Crewdson, 39, creates
large-scale color tableaux of ordinary people in not-quite-right
domestic settings. To realize his vision, he brings an entire film
crew to his suburban "sets" and spends months in the throes of "post
production."</LD>
<LD>   Though not unique in creating staged pictures (Cindy Sherman,
Laurie Simmons and Sharon Lockhart, among others, work in a related
vein), Crewdson takes his process to the limits of still photography,
employing a vast technical team that at times has included multiple
production managers, a director of photography, an aerial engineer,
several camera operators, a production designer, a lighting
supervisor, three gaffers, eight grips and electricians, two
pyrotechnics specialists, two casting consultants, a carpenter and,
of course, a few documentary photographers to record the process.</LD>
<LD>   People speak of Crewdson's work as film stills, but distilled
films might be more apt, since the movies they elusively refer to
don't exist.</LD>
<TE>   Despite all the behind-the-scene effort, the hallmark of the work
is an eerie calm. "Twilight," a Crewdson exhibition that opens today
at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills, contains 20 48-by-60-inch
richly colored and finely detailed C-prints that are as still as a
walk through a post-apocalyptic landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In these photographs, the latest in a series that Crewdson has
been working on since 1998, houses glow from unseen causes, school
buses lie toppled and ordinary frontyards bristle with tension from
the presence of hastily abandoned vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In all of the work, an air of mystery and menace hovers, and the
subtext is a driving story line that, if only the viewer could grasp
it, would surely explain everything.</TE>
<TE>   "My job as a photographer is to take all this production and make
it real," Crewdson, an amiably disheveled fellow, says over lunch a
few days before the first of three openings of "Twilight," in May at
the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Manhattan. (The show moves on to
London's White Cube Gallery after its Los Angeles engagement.)</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of my time is spent in production meetings
with designers, scanners, people who work with computers.</TE>
<TE>   "All to have an aesthetic experience at the end. I barely call
myself a photographer anymore. I say I'm an imagist. I'm interested
in creating a beautiful image. Beauty and mystery. It's very basic
art stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The pictures, done in editions of 10, plus two artist's proofs and
one print for Crewdson himself, sell for $15,000 each. Luhring
Augustine co-produced all of the current work, picking up half the
tab, which, the artist says, ran into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In one taunting narrative in the series, kids in a group stare at
an enormous mountain of flowers piled high in the middle of their
neighborhood street. ("It's my version of a memorial," Crewdson
says.)</TE>
<TE>   In another, moths glint in a shaft of light that pierces a
darkening road and illuminates an ungroomed patch of land. ("In all
the pictures," he says, "light is a narrative code, revealing or
illuminating or transforming.")</TE>
<TE>   In the jarring picture that serves as the cover of a new book
based on "Twilight," a woman, supine, floats in water in her living
room, a lamp and other furnishings reflecting in the liquid surface.
Her fixed stare is impenetrable.</TE>
<TE>   The photo was inspired by "The Death of Ophelia" by the 19th
century British artist John Everett Millet, a painting Crewdson
considers beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Is she alive or dead?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson has been pushing photography's boundaries for more than a
decade, to considerable acclaim. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Whitney and LACMA are among the museums that own his work, along with
such private collectors as agent Michael Ovitz, director Jan de Bont
("Twister") and "Frasier" writer-producer Chuck Ranberg.</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson's name was even bandied about on a recent episode of
HBO's "Six Feet Under." ("Personally, I think everything he does,
Gregory Crewdson did better, except years ago," an art student tells
teenage Claire Fisher, in a reference to another character, Billy
Chenowith.)</TE>
<TE>   An essay in the "Twilight" book by novelist Rick Moody tracks
Crewdson's transformation from high school rhythm guitarist in
Brooklyn to "demonic artificer" photographer by way of a 1962 show of
Diane Arbus' photos at the Museum of Modern Art that his father, a
psychoanalyst, took him to. ("It is weirdly personal," Crewdson says
of the essay. "I can barely bear to read it.")</TE>
<TE>   Crewdson started taking large color photos at Yale as a graduate
art student in the late 1980s (he currently teaches there full time).
Later, he focused on photographing miniature dioramas, each of which
would take him a month to build.</TE>
<TE>   Working in series related by themes and style, he next created the
lurid "Natural Wonder" (1992-97), which depicted color-saturated
nature scenes violated by bloody body parts. These were elaborately
staged but on a smaller scale than what was to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Next came "hover" (1996-97), 10 black-and-white pictures "filmed"
on location in Lee, Mass., a town in the Berkshires where his parents
had a home and where much of "Twilight" was also shot. For "hover,"
his first work with a production crew, he used an 8-by-10-inch camera
and shot from a crane, so the perspective is markedly voyeuristic and
somewhat otherworldly.</TE>
<TE>   The move from studio work to collaborating with others evolved
from a personal vision. "I knew I wanted to make photos from that
elevated point of view," he explains. "Once up there, I had to figure
out what to do. I wanted to photograph people in ordinary routines
where things have gone strange or wrong. I wanted to show a woman
planting rows of flowers in the street. I couldn't do that by myself.
There was something naturally cinematic about the idea."</TE>
<TE>   And so he began assembling a rudimentary crew that included a tree
surgeon, landscapers and the local fire department. The "hover"
pictures, like "Natural Wonder," explore ideas about domesticity and
nature and laid the foundations for the "Twilight" both in theme and
in intricacy.</TE>
<TE>   But this series used natural lighting, which simplified the
shooting process and didn't require permits or major intrusions into
town life. "We never officially closed any streets down," Crewdson
says.</TE>
<TE>   The large-scale production and color work of "Twilight" were not
just an artistic imperative; they were made possible by a fortuitous
meeting in 1998 with noted special effects creator Douglas Trumbull
("2001: A Space Odyssey," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"),
whose company at the time, Entertainment Design Workshop in western
Massachusetts, was a magnet for Hollywood pros.</TE>
<TE>   Through Trumbull, Crewdson met Rick Sands, a lighting wizard whose
credits include "A.I.," "Independence Day" and "Menace II Society."
Sands became Crewdson's director of photography, an indispensable
part of the artist's creative team.</TE>
<TE>   Reached in Massachusetts, Sands says the difference between
working on a full-scale Hollywood production and a Crewdson shoot is
negligible. "There's no sound, I guess," he says. "Gregory directs
every piece of frame. It's very busy as a shoot, as busy as a motion
picture. The way it's structured is like a motion picture. Everything
just unfolds."</TE>
<TE>   Even with the full-scale setups and professional lighting
enhancements, each picture also got a post-production digital scan
that brought together multiple frames in order to elicit optimal
effects from color, contrast and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about creating your own world," Crewdson says. "Mine
just happens to be suburbia. It's a setting to project my own
psychological drama onto. It's a flexible place to establish a
narrative. It feels familiar and ordinary, but I like to
defamiliarize it."</TE>
<TE>   If Crewdson actually makes the leap into filmmaking, as he says he
wants to do when the right project comes along, he will aim to follow
in the footsteps of the directors he most admires--Stanley Kubrick,
David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Steven Spielberg. "They have very
subjective and contiguous stories to tell. They are obsessed with a
central core of themes, motifs, images, et cetera," he says. "I
relate to this very much."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he says, stillness would be important. But narrative would be
also, along with framing and space and focus. Not for him the
abstractions of fellow artist Matthew Barney, whose three-hour movie
"Cremaster 3," he had just seen in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing. He had a million-dollar budget and an opening at
the Ziegfield. But it's a very elliptical, with no narrative sense."</TE>
<TE>   That's not his style. He says he'd make a film "with a real
story."</TE>
<TE>   And yet Crewdson's art derives from his proclivity to keep the
meaning just of reach. The viewer senses a before and an after, but
in fact there is in the "Twilight" series nothing but the irresolute
present. The artificial worlds in "Twilight," may seem provocatively
real, even in their improbabilities, but they are not.</TE>
<TE>   "Artists have a single story to tell," he says. "The struggle is
to attempt to reinvent the story in different forms, and make it new
each time."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it means.</TE>

<LD>   Silence Not Golden, Producer Discovers</LD>
<LD>   Mike Batt, a British composer and producer, has discovered that
silence doesn't come cheap.</LD>
<TE>   While putting together an album for a group called the Planets, he
composed variations on several classical pieces, including Bach's
Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 and Debussy's "Clair de Lune." He also
included a track titled "A One Minute Silence"--a nod to John Cage's
silent composition "4:33," in which musicians put down their
instruments and let the audience take in the ambient sound around
them.</TE>
<TE>   That last track was credited to Batt/Cage--just for a joke, the
composer told London's Independent newspaper. But he wasn't laughing
when Cage's publisher sent him a letter demanding royalties. The
silent track, the newspaper reported, had "enraged representatives of
the avant-garde, experimental composer."</TE>
<TE>   "My silence is original silence," Batt retorted, "not a quotation
from his silence."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Caprioglio, a representative of Cage's American publisher,
explained that the British organization that collects royalties had
sent its standard license form to Batt. No one had sent a letter to
Batt, he maintained--enraged or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "The article tries to make us sound ridiculous for taking this
position," he said. "Batt [was the one who] listed Cage as the
composer."</TE>
<TE>   Phone Breakthrough: No More Bells Ringing?</TE>
<TE>   Tired of those cell phones ringing at the most critical point of a
production? Take hope. A team of researchers has developed a wood
filled with magnetic particles that can block phone signals. It's
perfect for theater doors and walls, says the team leader, Hideo Oka,
of Iwate University in Morioka, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The invention works by sandwiching magnetic nickel-zinc ferrite
between layers of plywood, enabling 97% of microwave transmissions to
be blocked, he told the New Scientist, adding that it may be on sale
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, there have only been two ways of keeping cell-phone
mania under control: signal jamming, which is illegal, and reminding
customers to turn the machines off--seemingly beyond the capability
of some.</TE>

<TE>   Yoko Ono Receives Unorthodox Film Pitch</TE>
<TE>   British director Tony Kaye has never been one to pull his punches.
His legendary bizarre behavior includes a battle with New Line Cinema
over "American History X" in which he ran trade ads berating the
studio and unsuccessfully petitioned the Directors Guild of America
to have the movie released with a director's credit of "Humpty
Dumpty."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the former conceptual artist is taking an unorthodox
approach when it comes to practicing his craft--pitching the idea of
a film on Yoko Ono at an exhibit by the artist at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art.</TE>
<TE>   Placing a poem on a pile of rocks entitled "Mound of Joy," he
requested that he be given a shot at capturing the frequently
misunderstood artist.</TE>
<TE>   I would like to make a film about you, Yoko;</TE>
<TE>   One that would make you seem sane, not loco.</TE>
<TE>   I thought this would be a good way of making the pitch ...</TE>
<TE>   You know, getting to know you in an interesting way,</TE>
<TE>   Yours sincerely, Tony Kaye</TE>
<TE>   Ono, who attended the opening last week, has yet to respond.</TE>

<TE>   Entwistle Memorabilia Scooped Up on EBay</TE>
<TE>   A series of four serigraphs created by Who bassist John Entwistle,
who died Thursday of an apparent heart attack, sold Friday for $1,986
in a Sotheby.com auction hosted by EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The four caricatures Entwistle drew of himself and his three
original Who bandmates--Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey and Keith
Moon--had gone up for auction nine days before he died in Las Vegas,
just before the group was to start a U.S. tour.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 items of Entwistle memorabilia, from autographed
photos and CDs to a check bearing his signature, signed guitars and
pieces of his artwork, turned up on EBay in the hours after he died.
The most expensive: an autographed bass guitar that Entwistle
designed but never played. The top bid: $3,400 on Friday with three
days to go before the close of the auction.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Connick Sr. Salutes Ol' Blue Eyes</TE>
<TE>   Move over, Harry Connick Jr. Your dad is in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Connick Sr., a 76-year-old New Orleans district attorney,
will be in New Jersey tonight to sing tunes such as "Come Fly With
Me" and "The Lady Is a Tramp" in "A Salute to the Music of Frank
Sinatra."</TE>
<TE>   An inveterate music lover, Connick Sr. took the spotlight in 1989
while singing in New Orleans' French quarter with his son. Since
then, he has performed in nightclubs in his hometown and at concerts
across the country. In March, he announced that he wouldn't run for a
sixth term.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Clooney's publicist confirmed Friday that the 74-year-old
singer's cancer has returned. She is said to be in serious condition,
undergoing treatment at home. Doctors at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic
removed the upper lobe of Clooney's left lung in January. The surgery
was considered successful and no chemotherapy or radiation was
ordered.... Minnie Driver is set to play teacher Annie Sullivan in a
Broadway production of "The Miracle Worker," the Helen Keller story.
Rehearsals begin in January, USA Today reports.... Jerry Springer
will host a late-night talk show, "Jerry Springer Saturday Night," in
South Africa later this year, similar to the program he hosts in
England. The show, featuring a monologue and celebrity interviews, is
expected to air in more than 40 African countries by satellite....
The Geffen Playhouse is extending "Oscar &amp; Felix: A New Look at the
Odd Couple," Neil Simon's update of his Tony-winning comedy, through
July 27.</TE>

<HD>A 'Hunchback' by Any Other Name: It's a PC Quasimodo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story may sound familiar: A deformed man named Quasimodo works at
the Notre Dame cathedral and pines for the love of a beautiful gypsy
woman.</LD>
<LD>   But the title may come as a surprise: "The Bellringer of Notre
Dame."</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it's an adaptation of Victor Hugo's famous novel. But
producers at Oddsocks Production, a British theater company, have
retitled it for its current staging to avoid offending those who
suffer from Quasimodo's "hunchback" disability (curvature of the
spine).</LD>
<TE>   Producer Elli Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4's "Today" program that
the company did not want to "reinforce any prejudice that might be
there."</TE>
<TE>   Russel King, a lecturer on Hugo at Nottingham University, told the
London Daily Mail that the decision "smacked of the most silly
political correctness."</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the world knows the work by the 'Hunchback' name, so
why on earth change it?"</TE>
<TE>   Mackenzie argued that "hunchback" was not part of Hugo's original
title, "Notre Dame de Paris," but was added later in an English
translation.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a family organization, and our aim is to introduce the
classics," Mackenzie said. "There are a lot of children in the
audience and they would receive the message that it is OK to use that
label."</TE>

<HD>Davidson: A Hard Act to Follow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS and DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gordon Davidson was never sure how long his act would last in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   For the first two years he worked here in the mid-1960s, the
69-year-old theater producer and director confesses, he and his wife
kept their New York apartment. And in 1967, when he slotted "The
Devils" as the opening production in his first season leading the
Mark Taper Forum, the theater company's board was nervous enough
about the story--it involves a priest, a nun and their sexual
fantasies--to send board Chairman Lew Wasserman out to ask if
Davidson would be willing to start with something less controversial.</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, Davidson remembers telling Wasserman, it's too late to
change.</LD>
<TE>   Amid complaints by church officials and county supervisors, the
show went on, as have more than 200 Taper productions under
Davidson's leadership over the 35 years since then. Along the way,
Davidson not only emerged as dean of a burgeoning regional theater
scene, he won the West Coast a seat at the New York tables where
serious theatrical conversations are held.</TE>
<TE>   So Friday's news that Davidson will give up his Taper and Ahmanson
posts at the close of 2004 has theater people buzzing. And at the
Taper and its downtown sibling the Ahmanson--both operated by the
Center Theatre Group--the institutional soul-searching has just
begun.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be a tough act to follow," said playwright Terrence
McNally, who has had four productions staged at the Taper, most
recently "Master Class" in 1994-95. "I can't imagine theater in Los
Angeles without him."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the productions that won the Taper its greatest
notice--shows like 1978's "Zoot Suit," 1979's "Children of a Lesser
God" and 1992's "Angels in America"--Davidson brought to the theater
a steady supply of works rich in social consciousness and high in
plain entertainment value: Daniel Berrigan's "The Trial of the
Catonsville Nine" (a 1971 world premiere), Lanford Wilson's "Burn
This" (a world premiere in 1986-87); George C. Wolfe's musical
"Jelly's Last Jam" (a world premiere in 1990-91); and Peter Parnell's
"QED," a 2000-2001 world premiere.</TE>
<TE>   Despite perennial rumors of his imminent departure, he outlasted
five Los Angeles Times theater critics and sent more than 35
productions on to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1989, Davidson has also run the larger Ahmanson Theater.
That stage, which seats audiences of up to 2,100, generally serves as
a presenter of road shows born elsewhere, but occasionally presents
world premieres or Broadway tryouts, such as this year's reworking of
the Stephen Sondheim musical "Into the Woods."</TE>
<TE>   "I think of him as the father of Los Angeles theater--although he
has always seemed to me a young guy," said Dan Sullivan, the Los
Angeles Times theater critic from 1969 to 1989. "I thought that he
was such a charming fellow that I could only afford to talk to him
about once a year. We had a breakfast meeting once a year."</TE>
<TE>   But between breakfasts, Sullivan said, Davidson gave him and L.A.
audiences a nourishing, provocative diet of theater that sought to
address "all those worlds that comprise L.A. When I went to the
Taper, I didn't always have a good time, but I always knew that the
show was there because Gordon thought it was interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Still, not everyone in theater circles is grieving over Davidson's
departure plans. Some critics have long complained that Davidson
hasn't given local talent its due and has worried more about
exporting shows to Broadway than building a theater community at
home. Seasoned theatergoers, meanwhile, trade tales of the times
they've spied the silver-haired impresario nodding off in the
audience of one show or another.</TE>
<TE>   But few producers anywhere can rival the list of projects he has
encouraged and productions he has nurtured. Davidson has staged
premieres of works by playwrights Athol Fugard, A.R. Gurney, John
Guare, Jose Rivera, Anna Deavere Smith, August Wilson and Lanford
Wilson. Together, Davidson's productions have earned 18 Tony Awards
and three Pulitzers.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Gordon would be there forever," said playwright Neil
Simon, who has twice been produced at the Taper, beginning with
1979's world premiere, "I Ought to Be in Pictures." "He has done an
unbelievable job, to fill those two theaters constantly, and mostly
with good things." By the time Davidson took over the Taper in 1967,
a national surge in regional theater had already begun. Most of its
pioneers, including the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis (founded in
1963) and the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa (founded in 1964),
focused on classical repertory, relying on ongoing troupes of actors.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson, operating in the long shadow of the film and television
industries, knew he couldn't get that kind of time commitment from
the top actors in Los Angeles. Instead of cultivating a troupe, he
focused on performing new works. The first Taper season, in fact,
included two world premieres and two West Coast premieres.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember seeing that first production of 'The Devils,' and
admiring the boldness of the choice," said David Emmes, producing
artistic director of the South Coast Repertory and one of the few
theater professionals in the nation with more tenure than Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   Emmes, 63, and SCR artistic director Martin Benson, 65, who
started SCR in 1964, in November will open a third stage, giving the
institution a 507-seat mainspace, a 336-seat second stage and a
95-seat studio space. Davidson, Emmes added, has "always been one who
has thought deeply about theater and its responsibility to challenge
and provoke."</TE>
<TE>   Although more than a few Hollywood names have found their way onto
the Taper stage, sometimes in less-than-revolutionary productions,
this emphasis on new work endured over time, and Davidson's eagerness
to enter the political fray became increasingly clear. Davidson
himself staged two especially politically charged productions--"In
the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer" in 1968 and "The Trial of the
Catonsville Nine" in 1971. And seven years later, Luis Valdez's "Zoot
Suit," the first Taper production to address specifically Latino
concerns, became an enormous hit in Los Angeles, though it later
bombed on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Two Davidson-staged Taper premieres of the '70s went on to
Broadway success. Davidson won the Tony Award for directing Michael
Cristofer's "The Shadow Box," a play about cancer patients in a
hospice. It premiered at the Taper in 1975 and also received the
Pulitzer Prize. In 1979, Davidson directed Mark Medoff's "Children of
a Lesser God," the Broadway version of which won a Tony Award for
best play. Set at a school for the deaf, "Children" was later turned
into a Hollywood movie, but much to his disappointment, Davidson was
not chosen to direct it. (In fact, Davidson's lone effort as a film
director is a seldom-seen 1972 screen version of "The Trial of the
Catonsville Nine.")</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Davidson launched a modest springtime classical repertory
company at the Taper. For seven seasons, two plays were presented in
repertory each spring at either the Taper itself or the Doolittle
Theatre in Hollywood. After this expensive effort was discontinued
because of financial cutbacks, Davidson still tried to keep the
classical torch burning with occasional productions, with Kenneth
Branagh's Shakespearean company at the Taper in 1989 as well as
Shakespeare productions staged by Sir Peter Hall at the Ahmanson
Theatre, most recently, "Romeo and Juliet" in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson took over the artistic control of the Ahmanson shortly
after longtime producer Robert Fryer retired. From 1989 to 1993, the
Ahmanson seasons were presented at the Doolittle Theatre, while "The
Phantom of the Opera" occupied the Ahmanson. Following the 1993
closing of "Phantom," Davidson spearheaded a $17-million renovation
of the Ahmanson. Notable programming since then has included the
theatrical dance productions of British choreographer Matthew Bourne.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '90s, "The Kentucky Cycle" epic received its second
production at the Taper and then became the first play to win the
Pulitzer Prize without a New York staging. "Angels in America"
received its first full staging at the Taper and then its first half,
"Millennium Approaches," won the Pulitzer. "Twilight Los Angeles:
1992" reflected on the L.A. riots and, after moving to Broadway,
became the third Taper production to be among the four nominees for
the best play Tony in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Oskar Eustis, who directed the Taper's 1992 world premiere
production of Tony Kushner's "Angels in America, Part One: Millennium
Approaches," said that show was a quintessential example of
Davidson's ambitions as a producer: a piece of epic storytelling,
undertaken by a new writer, exploring American subject matter,
intertwining personal and political themes. Eustis served as
associate artistic director under Davidson in the late 1980s and
early 1990s and now is artistic director at the Trinity Repertory
Company in Providence, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Taper has continued to develop many new
plays, but the play development staff--much of it structured around
ethnic- or disabled-specific labs--has grown restless because of the
lack of opportunities to present mainstage productions. Davidson's
final big project--an $11-million conversion of a 1947 Culver City
movie house into a 325-seat Kirk Douglas Theater by the end of
2004--is intended as a solution to that frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Davidson's corner office overlooking Grand Avenue
remains very much occupied. The walls are festooned with memorabilia
for scores of shows and artworks from his son and daughter, now
grown. In one corner lies a Brooklyn Dodgers cap; nearby, a hard hat
from the mid-'90s renovation of the Ahmanson Theatre. Atop his
computer monitor sits another hard hat, from the theater yet to be
named in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   As for CTG, "everyone is looking forward to rethinking what CTG
will look like," said board President Richard Kagan. The leadership,
he said, "could be two artistic directors and one CEO; one artistic
director and one executive. The Taper needs an artistic director. The
Ahmanson is more of a commercial theater. How much can you do
creatively in a theater of that size? Maybe you need a businessperson
to run the Ahmanson. At the Douglas, a big component will be
children's theater. Maybe we need an educator there."</TE>
<TE>   It'll probably be 2004, Kagan said, before the search is narrowed
to finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "When an icon leaves a theater, the transition is always
difficult. And other theaters have had problems replacing
founder-leaders," said Sheldon Epps, artistic director of the
Pasadena Playhouse since 1997. "What he's designed, with this long
farewell, is a way to make a smooth and comfortable transition."</TE>
<TE>   The job of running the Taper and Ahmanson, Epps said, is both a
huge responsibility and a bully pulpit that is likely to attract
candidates of high caliber and ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he would be interested in the job, Epps said only, "I'm
always interested in new challenges."</TE>
<TE>   The Trinity Rep's Eustis also sounded a cautionary note about the
board members' search for a successor. "I really hope they're taking
that job very seriously," he said. "It's very tricky to find someone
who combines his artistic integrity with his common touch. The one
thing the [CTG] board has never done is hire an artistic director.

<HD>From Russia, With Verve</HD>
<DH>Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony whip
up raw excitement in a season-ending festival of Russian music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--Michael Tilson Thomas is ending his seventh season as
music director of the San Francisco Symphony with a three-week,
well-mixed festival of Russian music. It is an opportunity for a
native Angeleno to explore his own heritage (Tilson Thomas'
Russian-born grandparents were stars of Yiddish theater in New York),
as well as to demonstrate some of the authentic Russian tradition he
picked up as a student at USC, where he accompanied the master
classes of Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky. But really it is an
excuse to present "Mlada," the festival's flamboyant final work,
which was given the first of three semi-staged performances Thursday
night at Davies Symphony Hall.</LD>
<LD>   There isn't anything quite like Rimsky-Korsakov's surprisingly
little-known, over-the-top opera-ballet, given its premiere at the
Mariinsky Theater. in 1892. Actually there is a lot like it, starting
with Stravinsky's "Firebird" and "Rite of Spring," and continuing on
to other exotic, groundbreaking, early 20th century music by
Prokofiev, Debussy and maybe even Richard Strauss. But nothing quite
so wonderfully wacky. And, of course, Rimsky got there first.</LD>
<TE>   The inspiration for "Mlada," a mythic tale of pagan, pre-Christian
Russia, was Wagner's mythic, orchestrally extravagant,
special-effects-laden "Ring" cycle. But Rimsky also had peculiarly
Russian notions as well. The story of the ghost of Princess
Mlada--who comes back to avenge her murder and lead her noble prince,
Yaromir, to the spirit world, where the gods of good and evil busily
compete--is an extravagant pageant staged through dance and opera,
full of spectacular opportunities for large chorus and corps de
ballet. Mlada is portrayed by a ballerina; Yaromir, a heroic tenor.
What they all have in common is the orchestra, which is huge and the
astonishing glory of the work.</TE>
<TE>   The familiar Rimsky of "Scheherazade," written a few years
earlier, is everywhere present. But the composer here goes much
further. The wild scenes of pagan gods are a prescient explosion of
the kind of barbaric musical Modernism that Stravinsky, Prokofiev and
Bartok would years later exploit. But they are also full of
jaw-dropping, oddball exoticism.</TE>
<TE>   When three harps invite into their orgy of glissandi a pair of
chortling panpipes, placed in one of the boxes, Rimsky proves worthy
of being another MTT-championed maverick. At one point, Cleopatra
makes an entrance (don't ask), a clarinet has a virtuosic solo worthy
of Boulez. The catalog of special effects in the strings presage not
only Debussy but even Ligeti.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestrally, Tilson Thomas led a fabulous performance, reveling
in the color, audacity and sheer exhilaration of the score. The huge
massed effects--there are times when it almost sounds like a
percussion concerto--provided plenty of raw excitement, but the San
Francisco Symphony also displayed an extraordinary level of delicacy
and sensuous detailing. Within all this, Tilson Thomas further
encourages an impressive degree of individual expression from his
players.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the attempts at creating the illusion of a stage
picture in Davies Hall proved mostly counterproductive to the
orchestra's musical adventurousness. The action took place on a high
platform behind the orchestra and directly under the chorus, which
sits above the stage. Sandra J. Woodall designed a colorful backdrop
of sun and clouds that picked up the light. The singers, directed by
Peter McClintock, wore something between costume and concert dress
and performed from memory but were rarely successful at assuming
character.</TE>
<TE>   There was some strong singing, especially from Tigran
Martirossian, the prince who encourages his daughter, Voislava, to
offer Mlada a poison ring. But Ljuba Kazarnovskaya was not a feisty
Voislava, nor was Susanna Poretsky convincingly demonic as the evil
goddess Morena, who leads her on. Gegam Grigorian, the stalwart
leading tenor of the Kirov, was the stocky, not always secure but
still heroic Yaromir. A nice touch was the use of countertenor Brian
Asawa to sing the songs of a Czech bard, a male role written for
mezzo-soprano.</TE>
<TE>   Mlada was danced by former San Francisco Ballet star Evelyn
Cisneros, with traditional choreography by Val Caniparoli. But like
the singers, she seemed far away, dancing on the high, distant
platform and oddly conventional for such unconventional music. Her
presence only emphasized the lack of any other dancers; the big dance
numbers were played to an empty stage, creating a static sensation
despite the often amazing music.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, nothing could take away from the sense of astonishment
this work creates, or from the absolutely dazzling performance this
orchestra and the also impressive San Francisco Chorus were achieved.
From the moment MTT arrived at the San Francisco Symphony, he began
making waves. The surf's still up.</TE>

<HD>Palladium: Where Mambo Ruled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In many ways, the history of New York's Palladium ballroom is the
history of Afro-Cuban music. During the 1950s, the fabled venue
became a mecca for the mambo, a showcase for the best bands and the
sensational dancers who flocked to see them.</LD>
<LD>   A new documentary, "The Palladium: Where Mambo was King," captures
the spirit of what its narrator calls "a special time and a
remarkable place" for Latin music. The two-hour program, which can be
seen at 9 p.m. Sunday on Bravo as part of the channel's weekend
"Latin Sights and Sounds Festival," features vintage footage and
current interviews with musicians and dancers who still light up with
the thrill of having been there.</LD>
<LD>   It includes one of the last interviews with the late timbalero
Tito Puente, part of a troika of mambo superstars, with Tito
Rodriguez and Machito, who competed fiercely to top each other on
stage. Other interviews include Ruben Blades, Quincy Jones, Ray
Barretto and Eddie Palmieri, the salsa rebel who describes how he
tried to pull the Palladium's clientele across the street until he
was also invited to perform at the "House of the Mambo."</LD>
<TE>   The documentary offers a brief history of Afro-Cuban music and its
fusion with jazz in New York, catalyzed in 1939 when Mario Bauza
joined forces with Cab Calloway. Though the story will be familiar to
salsa aficionados, it's retold here in passionate accounts with
narrative gusto and fresh detail.</TE>
<TE>   The show is at its best when re-creating the revered venue's
charged atmosphere. "The night you went to the Palladium, you were a
princess," recalls one fan. "There was this sense that you had
entered another world."</TE>

<HD>Cultural Influences on Zanzibar Are in Focus at Film Fest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ZANZIBAR, Tanzania</DL>
<LD>Zanzibar's annual film festival opened Friday, bringing together
filmmakers and musicians from Africa and other parts of the world to
show their movies and perform their music in historic venues across
this Indian Ocean archipelago.</LD>
<LD>   The fifth annual Festival of the Dhow Countries focuses on the
culture of countries that influenced Zanzibar over the last
millennium, influences carried from India to the Arabian Sea and down
Africa's eastern coast by dhows, wooden ships with triangular sails.</LD>
<LD>   Opening performances highlighted the varied cultures touched by
dhows: A Palestinian band and a Zanzibari group entertained guests,
followed by a screening of "Lumumba," a movie about former Congolese
leader Patrice Lumumba, directed by Haitian Raoul Peck.</LD>
<TE>   "Lumumba" is a political thriller about Congo's first elected
prime minister, slain in 1961 during the rocky months after Congolese
independence from Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 films will screen at the festival, which runs
through July 13.</TE>
<TE>   Some will be shown in this semiautonomous region's villages using
mobile screens.</TE>
<TE>   The islands are about 25 miles off the Tanzanian coast and have an
estimated population of 900,000.</TE>

<LD>Heyward obituary--An April 7 obituary on writer-producer Louis "Deke"
Heyward said Heyward created the 1950s children's television series
"Winky Dink and You," the first interactive television show. In fact,
the show's credits, according to the Museum of Television &amp; Radio in
New York, list Harry W. Prichett and Edwin Brit Wyckoff as having
"originated" the series. Heyward was the first writer on the
partially animated show, which enabled viewers at home to help the
cartoon character Winky Dink and his dog Woofer out of their
predicaments by drawing on a "magic screen"--a clear piece of clingy
plastic placed on the TV screen. A delay in running a correction was
caused, in part, by a search of the U.S. Copyright Office in an
attempt to determine the show's creator.</LD>

<LD>Bob Verdi in the Chicago Tribune: "One disturbing aspect of the World
Cup is the insistence of some very annoying soccer nuts on shaming
the masses to fall in love with their sport.</LD>
<LD>   "These windbags are everywhere, in America and overseas, in the
public and the press....</LD>
<LD>   "Pay no attention to people who call us stupid for dismissing the
world's most popular sport, and by all means that includes European
'journalists' who label the U.S. soccer program a joke.</LD>
<TE>   "It's amazing how America can be dissed in so many different
languages--that is until other countries need protection or a few
billion dollars in loans."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the Laker career record for playoff
assists?</TE>
<TE>   Big deal: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "After watching
7-foot-5 Yao Ming in a workout, Denver Nugget General Manager Kiki
Vandeweghe said, 'It was a very impressive workout that is testament
to how far Chinese basketball has come.'</TE>
<TE>   "That's like gushing over how far inner-city yodeling has come."</TE>
<TE>   Short shift: How do you get a save by throwing one pitch--for a
ball? Here's how Texas reliever Randy Flores did it:</TE>
<TE>   He came on with two on and two out in the ninth inning, the
Rangers leading Houston, 9-6. On his first pitch, catcher Ivan
Rodriguez picked Richard Hidalgo off first base and Flores had the
first save of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Classy group: Tim Keown in ESPN The Magazine: "Did you catch how
the international players--five of the first 16 picks--handled
themselves on draft night. They're personable, they're confident and
they speak English better than many schoolteachers.</TE>
<TE>   "NBA teams are constantly telling their fans character is an
issue, and maybe the increasing reliance on overseas talent is one of
the results."</TE>
<TE>   Rout 'em anyway: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Now that
the bowl championship series honchos have eliminated point
differential from their ranking calculus, we'll go back to the good
old days when football powerhouses rolled up the score on an opponent
for the sheer sport of it."</TE>
<TE>   Unnecessary: Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times asks, "Isn't
banning a team [California] that finished 1-10 last year from playing
in a bowl game akin to telling Anna Kournikova she's ineligible to
play in the Wimbledon final?"</TE>
<TE>   Advance planning: Steve Hummer in the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: "Martha Stewart's 'College Football Insider'
says dump all your Miami stock and go with Florida State."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1990, the Dodgers' Fernando
Valenzuela and Oakland's Dave Stewart threw no-hitters on the same
day, a baseball first.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson, 2,346. It's also the NBA record.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Berkeley astrologer Andrea Mallis says she ran the
charts on Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent and--no surprise--"They have the
compatibility from hell. It's a strange brew of power struggles, one
upmanship, emotional explosiveness, making for volatile and unstable
relationships, not to mention goading each other to rash,
ill-considered, impulsive acts."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, they're real chummy.</TE>

<HD>Clippers' Jaric Deal on Hold</HD>

<LD>The Clippers said Friday that because of NBA rules, they cannot sign
Marko Jaric, a 6-foot-7 point guard from Yugoslavia, until July 17.
The team and Jaric have agreed in principle on a contract of either
three or four seasons, according to a league source.</LD>
<LD>   As if to underscore the point, the Clippers waived point guard
Earl Boykins, a 5-5 fan favorite who averaged 4.1 points in 68 games
last season. Boykins' $715,000 salary for next season would have
kicked in if he'd remained on the roster after Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, power forwards Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely, the
first-round draft picks, are expected to sign by July 8, when they
are scheduled to meet with reporters at Staples Center. Neither will
play in the summer league at Long Beach State, the Clippers said.</LD>
<TE>   They had hoped that Jaric, a second-round pick in 2000, could play
in a few summer league games, but he is slated to join the Yugoslav
national team July 15 for workouts for the World Championships, which
begin Aug. 29 at Indianapolis.</TE>

took a few laps around the nurses' station after undergoing surgery
in Dallas to donate a kidney to his younger sister.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Hall, 26, was moved from intensive care to a regular room at
Baylor University Medical Center, said spokeswoman Kathryn Goldstein.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeon Butch Derrick said Ostertag was adjusting to one kidney
and that the plan is to increase his activities daily.</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot-2 Ostertag was expected to be released today or Sunday.
The transplant was performed Thursday.</TE>

<TE>   The Toronto Raptors have made a qualifying offer to restricted
free-agent forward Keon Clark in order to retain his rights.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-11 Clark, 27, can receive contract offers from other teams,

team.</TE>
<TE>   Clark averaged 11.3 points and 7.4 rebounds last season.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Hug the Road</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Gagne makes it 29 out of 30 save opportunities
and L.A. increases lead with a 7-5 victory over Angels, who have some
trouble in outfield.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers showed once again Friday night that they are at home on
the road. Even if it's only about 35 miles down I-5 from Chavez
Ravine.</LD>
<LD>   Before a sellout crowd of 43,690 at Edison Field that appeared
split in allegiance, the Dodgers increased their National League West
lead to 3 1/2 games with a 7-5 interleague victory.</LD>
<LD>   "It was good to see a sellout," Angel starter Kevin Appier said.
"I don't like hearing cheers for the Dodgers, but it's understandable
as close as they are."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers wasted a 3-0 lead, then overcame a two-run deficit to
score the winning run in the eighth inning when an apparent sacrifice
fly hit by Mark Grudzielanek fell between Angel outfielders Darin
Erstad and Tim Salmon, allowing pinch-runner Cesar Izturis to score
from third base.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels put runners at first and third with two out in the
eighth, but Dodger closer Eric Gagne came on in relief of Giovanni
Carrara (5-2) and retired Scott Spiezio on a fly ball before pitching
a scoreless ninth for his major-league leading 29th save. With a
runner at second in the ninth, Gagne struck out Erstad with a 95-mph
fastball to end the game and give the Dodgers their ninth victory in
10 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers improved to 3-1 this season against the Angels with
the victory in the first game of a 10-game trip that will also take
them to Arizona and St. Louis before the All-Star break. They are
50-29 overall (tied with Seattle for the best record in baseball) and
23-14 away from home (best in the National League).</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts, Paul Lo Duca, Dave Hansen, Adrian Beltre and
Grudzielanek each had two hits for the Dodgers, who are 21 games over
.500 for the first time since Sept. 29, 1996, when they were 90-69.</TE>
<TE>   "We have grown since Day 1 of the season to where we're not real
particular about where we play," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "We
just want to go play and we're not overly concerned about the
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to sound braggadocious or anything like that. We're
just a good baseball team."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, opening a nine-game home stand after a 7-7 trip that
began with two losses in three games at Dodger Stadium, got
consecutive home runs from Troy Glaus and Brad Fullmer during a
five-run fourth inning, but could not make the lead stand up.</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 5-5, in the eighth when Hansen and Beltre hit
one-out singles against Angel reliever Scot Shields. Grudzielanek
then lofted a fly ball to right field that center fielder Erstad
drifted under while setting up to make the catch and throw to the
plate. At the last moment, however, he seemed to give way to Salmon.
The ball fell in and Izturis, running for Hansen, scored. Salmon
threw to second base to force out Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I heard [Erstad] say something," Salmon said. "At the
last second I'm watching him and the ball drops in front of me."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad took the blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I screwed up," Erstad said. "I'm the center fielder. It's my
responsibility to make sure that ball is caught regardless of whether
there is a play at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did manage to hold Dodger right fielder Shawn Green in
check, a feat virtually no one has been able to achieve since May 21.
Green entered the game batting .355 with 22 home runs and 41 runs
batted in since that date, but he went 0 for 5.</TE>
<TE>   Appier was hoping to build on Sunday's outing when he ended a
five-game losing streak by giving up one run and six hits in six-plus
innings against the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   But he was tagged for five runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings
against the Dodgers, who took a 3-0 lead in the fourth on an RBI
double by Hansen, a run-scoring ground ball by Beltre and a
run-scoring single by Grudzielanek.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Andy Ashby could not hold the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon and Garret Anderson hit consecutive singles to start the
fourth inning before Glaus stepped in and hammered a pitch from Ashby
into the left-field seats for his 15th homer, ending an 0-for-14
drought. Glaus had entered the game 18 for his last 116 at-bats
(.155).</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer followed Glaus' blast to left by hitting a towering shot
to right that glanced off the foul pole for his 10th homer. Spiezio
doubled to right, moved to third on Fabregas' ground ball to first
base and scored on Kennedy's fly ball to right to put the Angels
ahead, 5-3.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL-DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Is Watkins Going Too Low?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman pursuing the purchase of the
Angels, has informed Disney officials he believes the franchise is
worth no more than $200 million, a source close to the negotiations
said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   If Watkins submits an offer for that amount, the most pressing
question surrounding the negotiations could shift from whether
Watkins can satisfy nagging concerns about his ability to afford the
team to whether Disney would be willing to sell at that price.</LD>
<LD>   Disney paid $140 million to buy the Angels in 1996 and another $98
million to renovate Edison Field, so a $200-million sale price would
not allow the company to recover those costs, let alone any operating
losses. The Angels reported losses of $100 million from 1995-2001,
according to figures released by the commissioner's office.</LD>
<TE>   Forbes magazine values the Angels at $195 million. In a memo to
clubs about debt limitations, Commissioner Bud Selig defined the
franchise value as twice the annual revenue of a team, subject to
appeal. The Angels reported revenues of $92 million last season,
which would place their value at $184 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney asked $300 million for the Angels during sale negotiations
three years ago. Last fall, when Selig tried to broker a sale to John
Henry, then the owner of the Florida Marlins, Disney is believed to
have told major league officials it would have accepted $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins declined to comment. Angel President Paul Pressler could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels decided to demote starting pitcher Scott
Schoeneweis and replace him with rookie John Lackey, they had a
problem. The Angels sent Lackey to triple-A Salt Lake on Tuesday, and
players sent to the minor leagues must stay there for 10 days,
barring an injury to a major leaguer.</TE>
<TE>   So reliever Al Levine, who has pitched despite tendinitis in his
right shoulder for most of the month, was put on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 11 innings, Levine has given up eight runs, seven
walks and 17 hits. He'll concentrate on strengthening his shoulder;
he says he feels discomfort on some pitches and his delivery is out
of whack.</TE>
<TE>   "I could pitch," Levine said, "but I've been so bad why would you
want me to?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy, selected as a National League coach for
the All-Star game, is confident that right fielder Shawn Green,
starter Odalis Perez and closer Eric Gagne will also represent the
club July 9 at Miller Park in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The selections will be announced Sunday, and Tracy would like
starter Kazuhisa Ishii added to the list.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll lobby hard for four," he said. "The fact that I've been
asked to be a coach, I think I would have the right to just inquire.
Obviously, it could be told to me that that's really none of my
business, but I at least want to inquire as to who some of the other
candidates are that we're comparing and contrasting that fourth spot
to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy plans to continue riding Gagne in the second half, saying
the right-hander is not close to being overworked.</TE>
<TE>   If anything, Tracy said Gagne might benefit from an increased
workload despite having already converted 29 of 30 save
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "His pace has been great," Tracy said. "You can make a case that
he has been somewhat underused because of the number of saves he has
and the [number of] pitches he's used."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Hansen welcomed the opportunity to start at designated hitter
Friday, but it precluded him from a shot at tying coach Manny Mota's
club record for pinch-hits.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen has 105 hits as a pinch-hitter, one shy of Mota's mark set
during a Dodger career that spanned parts of 13 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen credits Mota, who had 150 pinch-hits during his 20-year
career, for his success.</TE>
<TE>   "I've already said he's the best pinch-hitter there ever was,"
Hansen said. "He put the role of the pinch-hitter pretty much on the
map. And he did it by himself. I don't think he had anybody around
like I do with him as a mental mentor so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Mota said he will be happy when Hansen ties his record and proud
when he breaks it. "He's not only a good hitter, but he is a great
clutch hitter," Mota said. "His mental preparation is what makes him
so good. He is a great pro."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minor league field coordinator Terry Collins, arrested Thursday in
Augusta, Ga., and charged with driving under the influence of
alcohol, remains on the job while the Dodgers determine how to handle
the matter.</TE>

<HD>Angels Shake Up the Rotation</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rookie Lackey promoted despite only one major
league game. Schoeneweis moves to the bullpen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels, opting for an unproven rookie over proven inconsistency,
demoted starter Scott Schoeneweis to the bullpen Friday and replaced
him in the rotation with John Lackey.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have a leg to stand on, really," Schoeneweis said.
"There's no argument."</LD>
<LD>   Schoeneweis, 28, in his third season in the Angel rotation, is 6-6
with a 5.38 earned-run average. He never has posted a winning record
or an ERA below 5.00.</LD>
<TE>   Lackey, 23, made his major league debut Monday, shrugging off a
433-foot home run by Alex Rodriguez in the first inning and holding
the Texas Rangers to three runs over seven innings. Schoeneweis
pitched the next night, giving up three home runs in 4 2/3 innings.
He started the fifth inning with a 4-2 lead but walked four in the
inning, and the Rangers scored eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   While the move does not preclude Schoeneweis from returning to the
rotation, the Angels believe he might be better suited to the
bullpen. The Angels, searching for another left-handed reliever to
accompany Dennis Cook, would like to see Schoeneweis prosper in that
role.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do what I can to help the team get to the playoffs," he
said. "If I can be more valuable in the bullpen right now, that's
what I'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Statistics suggest Schoeneweis could do well there. Opposing
left-handers hit .242 off him this season and .249 in the previous
three; right-handers hit .284 this season and .291 in the previous
three. This season, opponents are hitting .232 off him in the first
inning, .261 in the first three innings and .276 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "If Scott rises to the occasion, he can be an impact guy in that
role," General Manager Bill Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the durability and strength to throw 130 pitches in a
major league game and the ability and resiliency to pitch every day,"
pitching coach Bud Black said. "There aren't too many pitchers with
that combination. Who's to say what's going to happen in one or two
weeks? He might be back starting again, but he might do so well we
might not want to move him."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels cleared roster space for Lackey by putting reliever Al
Levine on the disabled list. They remain interested in trading for
pitching help, particularly bullpen help.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the starting rotation of a team in a pennant race
includes a pitcher with one major league game to his credit. Lackey
had won his last eight decisions at Salt Lake, with an 8-2 record and
2.70 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "If you trust a pitcher has the makeup to pitch beyond his
experience and give him the opportunity, he can surprise you,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We think John is a special guy as far as
makeup. Hopefully, that will translate into a guy that can come out
and pitch like he did in Texas."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>The owner of the Anchorage Aces of the West Coast Hockey League said
the $2.3-million bid received Thursday for the team in an auction on
EBay Inc. was a mistake, and the team is still for sale.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Cusack Jr. said that the bid was placed by a student who was
curious about the auction. The student's identity wasn't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Cusack said he's going to re-list the team on EBay.</LD>
<TE>   Cusack is trying to sell the team after the Aces filed for Chapter
11 protection last month with about $2 million in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Cusack, who has owned the Aces since their inception in 1995,
posted the team on EBay on Saturday. He had gotten only one bid for
$1.5 million through Wednesday evening, then three bids came in that
night before the final offer.</TE>
<TE>   If the team sells for the $2.3 million Cusack is seeking, it would
be the second-biggest transaction ever for EBay and the first sports
team that would ever be sold on the site, an EBay spokesman said.</TE>

<LD>When Club America of Mexico faces River Plate of Argentina in an
international exhibition tonight at 8 in the Coliseum, the Eagles
will be meeting a familiar foe while preparing for bigger and better
things.</LD>
<LD>   America, champions of the Mexican first division Summer
tournament, and River Plate, Argentina's Closing tournament titlist,
have met twice in the last four months in the South American Copa
Libertadores tournament. America defeated River Plate, 1-0, in Buenos
Aires on Feb. 28 before playing to a scoreless tie in Mexico City on
March 13.</LD>
<LD>   America advanced from its Libertadores group and will play Sao
Caetano of Brazil in the semifinals July 9.</LD>
<TE>   "We're using this match as a warm-up," said America forward Ivan
Zamorano, a native of Chile. "It's a personal dream to be able to
play for the [South American club] championship after already winning
championships in Chile and Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   America is bringing its full squad to the Coliseum, including
Frankie Oviedo, a midfielder on the Colombian national team, and
Mexican players Pavel Pardo, Duilio Davino and Luis Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   River Plate is led by Fernando Cavenaghi, whose 14 goals led the
Argentine league, and playmaking midfielder Andres D'Alessandro.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Changes Remain in Effect</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Schmid will keep Cienfuegos and Califf on bench in
game against D.C. United.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking to jump-start his team's stagnant attack, Coach Sigi Schmid
benched two venerable starters in the Galaxy's match last weekend
against the Dallas Burn. A change was needed, especially after the
Galaxy had been hammered, 5-0, a week earlier by the New York-New
Jersey Metro- Stars.</LD>
<LD>   With midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos, a member of the Galaxy since
its inaugural 1996 season, and defender Danny Califf watching from
the sidelines, the Galaxy responded by pulling out a 3-0 victory over
the Burn.</LD>
<LD>   Expect Cienfuegos and Califf to remain on the bench today for the
Galaxy's match against D.C. United at Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously the team responded and played well enough to deserve
another shot at it," Schmid said Friday afternoon from Washington.
"It was a jump-start but we changed our formation as well, so that
made a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid said the Galaxy will remain in a 3-4-3 formation against
D.C. United, and that Alejandro Moreno and Tyrone Marshall would
retain their starting positions in place of Cienfuegos and Califf.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, with Cienfuegos, a playmaking midfielder, the Galaxy is
essentially locked into a 4-4-2 lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more flexibility without Cien," Schmid said. "We haven't
been as interchangeable in the middle of the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll stay in a 3-4-3, especially when we play a team in a
4-4-2."</TE>
<TE>   Schmid said Cienfuegos and Califf have been professional in
handling their demotions.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy defeated D.C. United, 2-1, in overtime in the season
opener at the Rose Bowl on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Ruiz converted a penalty kick two minutes into the extra
period for the victory. It was Ruiz's second goal--he had tied the
score in the game's 85th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who led MLS in scoring for most of the season with 20 points
on 10 goals, has not scored in three games (he was suspended for one
of those games), and is currently in fourth.</TE>

<LD>Walter Hall shot a six-under-par 65 Friday to take a one-shot lead
over Tom Kite and Jose Maria Canizares at the midway point of the
U.S. Senior Open at Owings Mills, Md.</LD>
<LD>   It was Hall's first sub-70 score in 14 rounds at the Senior Open.</LD>
<LD>   "I probably won't ever do it again, but I sure had my day in the
sun today," said Hall, who has a seven-under 135 total. "This was my
Tom Kite imitation today."</LD>
<TE>   Kite shot a 67 and is at 136 with Canizares, who shot his second
68.</TE>
<TE>   R.W. Eaks, who tied a tournament record with a 64 on Thursday,
fell off the pace with a double bogey on the 16th hole and finished
with a 73 for a 137.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gibson, Tom Watson and Isao Aoki were at 138. Gibson and Aoki
shot 69s, Watson a 71.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer had three triple bogeys and a double bogey, shooting
an 85 for a 25-over total. But he wasn't the only one to struggle on
the 7,005-yard Caves Valley Golf Club course.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Player, who shot a 75 for a 154, and defending champion Bruce
Fleisher, who shot a 75 for a 151, were among several prominent
golfers who missed the cut of 149.</TE>

and he went to No. 18 tied with Notah Begay, Pat Bates and Jay Haas
at 11 under. He concluded his bogey-free round with his sixth birdie
as he holed a 28-foot putt for the lead by himself at 12-under 130.</TE>
<TE>   Begay turned in a 65 that was his best score in 73 rounds. That
tied him with Bates (63) and Haas (64) at 131.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kate Golden parlayed a midweek swing change into a seven-under 64
and had a one-stroke lead after the first round of the ShopRite LPGA
Classic, the final tuneup for next week's U.S. Women's Open.</TE>
<TE>   Juli Inkster and Lorie Kane were tied for second at Galloway
Township, N.J., and Annika Sorenstam put herself in position for a
fourth win in six starts and sixth win in 12 events this year by
shooting a 68 at the Bay Course of the Marriott Seaview Resort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three-time British Open champion Seve Ballesteros of Spain has
withdrawn from next month's event. Ballesteros has missed the cut in
the British Open the last six years.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They seem to win all the time, they come from the same barn, they
have Northern Dancer in their bloodlines and track announcers
hesitate, lest they confuse their names, but Astra and Azeri would
not be mistaken for twins. Stand them side by side and you can tell.
Astra outweighs her stablemate by a good 250 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Competitively, there's another major difference. Azeri does her
winning on the main track, whereas Astra, although she frequently
trains over dirt, is a grass-loving mare in the tradition of her sire
Theatrical, a turf champion in Ireland and North America.</LD>
<LD>   One thing for sure: Astra and Azeri leave one another with tough
acts to follow. On May 25, Azeri racked up her sixth victory in seven
starts, winning the Milady Handicap at Hollywood Park by 3 1/2
lengths. Two days later, Astra had to work much harder, barely
winning the Gamely Handicap for her 10th victory in 14 starts.</LD>
<TE>   In their latest go-round, Azeri has struck the first blow again,
having won last Saturday's Vanity Handicap by three lengths. Today,
Astra has a chance to catch up, in the Beverly Hills Handicap, a race
she won convincingly a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Laura De Seroux, who trains both horses for Michael Paulson and
the Allen Paulson Living Trust, is not intimidated by the eight
rivals who will line up for the Beverly Hills, one of the bigger
fields Astra has seen.</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux, an exercise rider and later an assistant trainer during
a 17-year run with the late Charlie Whittingham, goes to the ends of
the earth--in a way--to separate Azeri and Astra.</TE>
<TE>   "They're as different as the North and the South poles," the
50-year-old trainer said. "If they were tennis players, Astra would
be Lindsay Davenport and Azeri would be Steffi Graf. Azeri is the
lovable one, the one who's cat-like. Astra is not mean, but she
internalizes everything, she's in her own world. She does everything
big, she even gallops strongly. She's the amazon."</TE>
<TE>   The World Ranking panel, a newly formed group of seven
international handicappers, has found a preliminary pedestal for
each. Azeri is listed as the best distaffer on dirt, by a wide
margin, and Astra is No. 1 in the filly and mare turf division. Many
of the horses on the lists are expected to show for Breeders' Cup day
at Arlington Park on Oct. 26. Azeri figures to run in the $2-million
Distaff and Astra's likely spot is in the $1-million Filly &amp; Mare
Turf.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, a 4-year-old Jade Hunter filly, has never run at Arlington,
but last summer Astra, in the 6-year-old mare's only start at the
suburban Chicago track, finished last in the Beverly D. Stakes. A few
days later, the Paulson horses were taken away from trainer Simon
Bray and Astra was sent to De Seroux.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not afraid of running Astra over the Arlington course again,"
De Seroux said. "It's a misconception that she didn't like the soft
ground in the Beverly D. It wasn't the ground, it was her foot."</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux said Astra was suffering from an abscess, which actually
made a hole in her left front foot. After the Beverly D., Astra was
taken out of training for a couple of months and didn't run again
until she finished third, after a seven-month layoff, in the Santa
Ana Handicap in March at Santa Anita. A month later, Astra reversed
the result on Golden Apples, the horse who had beaten her, in a swing
that amounted to more than five lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Between now and the Breeders' Cup, De Seroux must juggle a racing
schedule as well as weight assignments for both of her horses. Astra
will carry 124 pounds today, a career high, and Azeri was bumped up
three pounds, to 125, after winning the Vanity. This is already more
weight than Azeri would carry in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, which as
a weight-for-age race assigns a maximum of 123 pounds to older
horses.</TE>
<TE>   "The 125 pounds last time was a bit onerous," De Seroux said. "I
should have squawked but I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the coming races are also handicaps, and should Azeri keep
on winning, De Seroux might have to cut races rather than subject her
to more weight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belterra, whose career was interrupted earlier in the year because
of throat surgery, was scratched from today's $250,000 Mother Goose
at Belmont Park because of a fever. That leaves only four
starters.... Street Cry, one of the early favorites for horse of the
year, will skip the Suburban Handicap at Belmont a week from today
and point for the Whitney at Saratoga on Aug. 3.</TE>

<LD>There have been few hiccups for Astra, who in her career has won 10
of 14 races and nearly $1.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   In one of her rare flops, the 2000 Beverly Hills Handicap, she
finished fourth in a field of five at 6-5, six lengths behind winning
Happyanunoit.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-year-old Theatrical mare made amends by winning the Grade I
last year and she will be a short price today to become the first
repeat winner since Flawlessly in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by the family of the late Allen Paulson and trained by Laura
De Seroux, Astra will be seeking her sixth victory in seven starts on
the Hollywood Park turf course.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, who won his only Beverly Hills with
Happyanunoit, will send out Peu A Peu and Karsavina. The trainer just
missed beating Astra with Starine in last month's Gamely, but Starine
is being pointed for the Ramona Handicap on July 27 at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   A German-bred owned by Gary Tanaka, Peu A Peu won the Yerba Buena
Breeders' Cup Handicap, a Grade III, at Bay Meadows in her American
debut on May 18. This is a step up in class, but she is getting eight
pounds (124-116) from Astra.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Allen's Karsavina won as the 7-10 favorite in her U.S. debut
at Hollywood Park on May 22 and she will be seeking her first graded
stakes victory.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Echelon, Turkish Prize, Beautiful Balance and
seven other turf specialists will get together in Hollywood Park's
fifth, the final leg of a Churchill Downs simulcast network pick
four.</TE>
<TE>   There is also an NTRA pick three that includes the Molly Pitcher
Breeders' Cup Handicap from Monmouth Park, the Arlington Classic from
Arlington Park and the Mother Goose from Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Tom Amoss.</TE>
<TE>   The trainer has won with 18 of his 57 starters at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Lexi's Habit.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing seventh of eight at nearly 50-1 going 870 yards
against quarter horses at Los Alamitos, the 3-year-old filly shows up
in a $43,000 maiden turf race today at Hollywood Park. The over-under
on how many lengths she will lose by is 25.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Babbler in the sixth,
using Astra and Peu a Peu in the seventh, Irish Muldoon and Well
Known Act in the eighth and Aim For The Moon, Kelli's Ransom, Charm A
Song, Wilshewed and Dream Day in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 0/123. Money:

<HD>Indians Win Behind a New Ace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>C.C. Sabathia showed he can be Cleveland's ace after the trade of
Bartolo Colon as the Indians began rebuilding with an 8-2 victory
over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday night at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Sabathia (6-6) gave up only one earned run and four hits in 7 2/3
innings one day after the Indians sent Colon to the Montreal Expos in
a six-player deal.</LD>
<LD>   Before the game, Cleveland Manager Charlie Manuel said he hoped
Sabathia "will show he's a No. 1 [starter]," and that's exactly what
the 21-year-old left-hander did.</LD>
<TE>   Sabathia struck out five and walked three in winning for the first
time in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Magruder hit a three-run homer, and Ellis Burks had a
two-run shot as the Indians scored seven runs in the fourth inning
off Miguel Batista (4-5) and rolled past the defending World Series
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome, rumored to be the next Indian star on the trading
block, had a solo homer, his 22nd, in the seventh off Greg Swindell.</TE>
<TE>   Colon's stunning trade surprised his teammates and angered many
Cleveland fans. Several brought signs into the ballpark to show their
displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   One read: "Keep Thome and Omar [Vizquel]," while another
criticized General Manager Mark Shapiro, saying: "Shapiro Bobblehead
Day, June 27. No Spring Needed."</TE>
<TE>   But at least for a few hours the fans got to enjoy seeing the
Indians play the kind of ball that has given them six American League
Central titles in seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks didn't get their second hit off Sabathia until
the sixth inning. But he contained the damage by getting Luis
Gonzalez to ground into a 6-4-3 double play that brought home Craig
Counsell.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, Colorado 2--Joel Pineiro pitched a six-hitter to win
his fourth consecutive start and Bret Boone hit a three-run homer as
the Mariners won at Seattle. The AL West-leading Mariners stretched
their winning streak to four games with their 50th victory, while the
Rockies dropped their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Boone's 10th homer of the season, an opposite-field shot to right,
came in the fifth inning off rookie Jason Jennings to break a 2-2
tie. With two out, Edgar Martinez walked and Carlos Guillen singled
before Boone's homer.</TE>
<TE>   Plate umpire Brian Gorman warned Rockies reliever Todd Jones and
both benches after Jones knocked down Boone with a head-high fastball
in the seventh. It was Jones' first pitch to Boone in Boone's first
at-bat after his homer. Boone got up and responded with a single,
went to third on Dan Wilson's single and scored on a wild pitch by
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Boston 2--Vinny Castilla and Henry Blanco drove in runs
in the ninth inning as the Braves won at Boston in a matchup of teams
that began the night as division leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Wakefield (2-3) gave up a leadoff double in the ninth to Gary
Sheffield, who stayed at second as the next two batters flied out to
center field. Then Castilla singled in Sheffield, Darren Bragg walked
for the third time and Blanco doubled home Castilla.</TE>
<TE>   John Smoltz retired the side in order for his 26th save. Mike
Remlinger (4-0) got the victory after pitching the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 10, San Francisco 6--Mark Mulder won his seventh
consecutive start and Eric Chavez drove in four runs for the
Athletics, who won at Oakland to end a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (9-4) cruised through the first eight innings, but gave up
four hits in the ninth before giving way to Mike Venafro with one out
left. Venafro struck out Barry Bonds to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker had Jeff Kent batting third and Bonds
behind him for the second consecutive game. Kent hit a two-run home
run in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 14, San Diego 10--Mike Sweeney homered for the fourth
consecutive game and drove in five runs as the Royals won at Kansas
City, Mo., rallying from two five-run deficits to defeat the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, who leads the majors with a .367 batting average,
extended his hitting streak to a season-high 11 games. He had a
bases-clearing double in a five-run seventh as the Royals took the
lead for the first time. Sweeney also tied his own club record with
home runs in four consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Texas 5--Roy Oswalt struck out nine, including the last
three batters he faced, and the Astros won at Arlington, Texas.
Oswalt (8-5) gave up three runs and seven hits over seven innings.
The right-hander, one of the National League's top rookies last
season, is 20-7 with a 3.02 earned-run average in 37 career starts.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Merced hit a two-run homer off Chan Ho Park (3-4) and
later scored on Brad Ausmus' go-ahead double for the Astros.
Houston's Billy Wagner got his 12th save.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Toronto 1--Tony Armas Jr. and Scott Stewart combined
on a three-hitter and Fernando Tatis hit a tiebreaking home run in
the seventh inning as the Expos won at Toronto. Montreal slugger
Vladimir Guerrero went 0 for 4, ending his 20-game hitting streak.
Armas (8-7) gave up one run and three hits in seven innings,
improving to 3-0 in his last five starts. Stewart pitched two perfect
innings for his ninth save.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Baltimore 2--Pat Burrell hit a three-run homer and
Randy Wolf got his first victory in more than a month as the Phillies
won at Baltimore. Jimmy Rollins, Jeremy Giambi and Scott Rolen also
homered for the Phillies, who have won four of five games. Wolf (4-6)
was 0-4 in six starts since defeating Arizona on May 19.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Florida 0--Wilson Alvarez gave up four hits in seven
innings at St. Petersburg, Fla., to earn his first victory at home in
nearly three years. Alvarez (2-2), who missed the last two seasons
recovering from left shoulder surgery, struck out five and walked
three to extend his streak of scoreless innings against the Marlins
this season to 13.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Milwaukee 1--A.J. Pierzynski and Dustan Mohr each hit
two-run homers and Johan Santana threw eight strong innings for the
Twins at Minneapolis. Santana (3-1) gave up four singles, didn't walk
anybody and struck out a career-high nine.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Detroit 1--Josh Fogg gave up two hits over seven
innings for the Pirates at Detroit. The victory was only Pittsburgh's
fourth in 14 games, while the Tigers have lost eight of nine.</TE>

<HD>In a Rush, Tears Turn to Joy</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Kareem Rush is expected to be able to achieve in
NBA what troubled brother could not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For nearly two hours, two years apart, their NBA draft nights passed
much the same way, one brother on the brink of career disaster, the
other holding back tears, then finally letting them go.</LD>
<LD>   Glenda Rush spoke Friday afternoon, sounding as though she still
carried the weight of both experiences.</LD>
<LD>   As her middle son, Kareem, held up a gold Laker jersey, No. 21,
fresh from the box at a news conference in El Segundo, her oldest,
JaRon, was at home in Kansas City, hoping for one more telephone call
but facing one more court date.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm still hoping maybe one day JaRon will get in there," she said
wearily. "But it looks like maybe Kareem will be playing for the
whole family if things don't get turned around here. I'm not afraid
for JaRon. If he doesn't play basketball, I just hope he finds a
decent career, a decent job. If he never plays another game of
basketball it's fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Rush arrived at Laker headquarters Friday morning, wearing
a casual tan suit over a black T-shirt, accompanied by agent Calvin
Andrews. He stood outside a gate in the parking lot for several
minutes while security personnel located someone who could confirm
the identity of the 6-foot-6, square-shouldered Rush, who smiled at
the inconvenience. If things go as planned for him, anonymity will be
only a phase. There for a while, though....</TE>
<TE>   Expecting to be drafted 14th by the Indiana Pacers, possibly even
higher by another team, Rush went 20th to the Toronto Raptors. By the
time Kareem's name was called in the tiny theater at Madison Square
Garden, JaRon had left.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, JaRon, known during his two seasons at UCLA for his
talent and the controversy it brought, was ignored in the draft. On
that night, Kareem, watching alone, left his apartment, walked alone,
and wept for his big brother.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday night, as the picks fell away, and as Kareem's mood
darkened, JaRon could no longer watch, either.</TE>
<TE>   "It was horrible," Glenda Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   NBA draft days have this habit of being life-altering events in
the Rush family, though, and maybe this draft owed Glenda Rush one.
Even as Kareem brooded and mulled skipping a draft party thrown in
Manhattan for second pick Jay Williams, his rights were traded an
hour later to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem rejoiced and JaRon cried happily at the fortunate turn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really exciting time in my life," said Kareem, seated
beside Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak, that jersey spread across
his lap. "I could [have been picked] No. 1. I'd rather be here."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, who got out from under Lindsey Hunter's contract and
added shooter Tracy Murray in the deal with the Raptors, were just as
thrilled. Kupchak hardly expected Rush to be available at No. 20, so
Rush was not on the list provided by the Lakers to Toronto General
Manager Glen Grunwald. When it was the Raptors' turn, Kupchak called
with the instructions to select Missouri's Rush, a left-handed
forward the Lakers hope to turn into a shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   Said one longtime NBA observer, "They stole him. Mitch Kupchak
ought to be in jail for getting that kid at 27 [the Lakers' drafting
spot]," adding that Rush would be recognized as one of the top 10
players of the draft, even in a Laker system generally not favorable
for young players.</TE>
<TE>   Though contract negotiations cannot begin until Monday, both sides
expect a guaranteed, three-year deal to be done in time for Rush to
play for the Lakers' summer-league team. Players report for practice
next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Had their lives proceeded as expected, Kareem would be only months
from joining JaRon in the NBA. One day, maybe, they would have been
on the same floor, as if they were back on the playgrounds of Kansas
City, so smooth and skilled, with nothing but time and wealth ahead
of them.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in the hours after the draft and trade, Kareem went to
Los Angeles for a news conference and JaRon returned to Kansas City,
where he'll soon be in court to defend himself against a
drunk-driving charge. According to the Kansas City Star, JaRon was
arrested early on the morning of May 21, after police had observed
his car weaving. His blood alcohol tested at .31. Missouri's legal
limit is .08. Slightly more than a year ago, JaRon, through his
agent, revealed that he was a recovering alcoholic intent on
maintaining his sobriety.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Glenda Rush said, "He's not been doing anything.
Nothing. I am worried. I really am. I hope something happens for him
pretty soon here."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest was merely the latest in a series of uncomfortable
episodes for JaRon, whose first extensive problems arose while he was
at UCLA. He became the focus of an NCAA investigation into cash
benefits provided by an AAU coach in Kansas City and an L.A agent,
and was suspended for most of his sophomore season. With little other
choice, he believed, he declared for the 2000 draft. In part because
of the gathering controversy, Kareem chose to attend Missouri rather
than UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Undrafted, JaRon was invited to training camp by the Seattle
SuperSonics in the fall of 2000, then was cut. He since has bounced
around the satellite basketball leagues, leaving teams sometimes by
trade, other times after being released.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night in New York, when JaRon finally learned that his
brother was a first-round pick, just as he had once expected himself
to be, he cried.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew that somebody in the family finally made it," Kareem
said. "I always expected him to be the first one to do it, and he was
going to be able to coach me through the whole process.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out for him. I know later on down
the road they will.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big day for my family. It's a big day for us."</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Rush, the Lakers hope, is the large shooting guard who one
day will replace Brian Shaw and allow Kobe Bryant to spend more time
on the wing. For now, however, he'll be a rookie learning a new
offense, surrounded by All-NBA players, other well-schooled veterans
and three recent championship banners.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, he is bright and earnest on offense, with some
things to learn defensively. He averaged 21.1 points and made 44.2%
of his shots, including 44.8% of his three-point shots, as a
sophomore. Last season, those numbers fell slightly, part of the
reason, perhaps, Rush fell to 20th in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Targeted by defenses, Rush by the end of the season had developed
a mid-range fadeaway jump shot and a better floor sense.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing about Kareem, he's very comfortable out on the floor,"
Missouri assistant coach Lane Odom said. "He won't be afraid.</TE>
<TE>   "Shooting is what will set him apart."</TE>
<TE>   A possible top-10 draft pick after his sophomore season, Rush
remained at Missouri for one more. Odom said he thought JaRon's
personal trials had contributed to Kareem's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "He has handled it well," Odom said. "I think he paid close
attention to some of the situations his brother has been in, in order
to educate himself. In that regard, he felt like he needed to spend
another year here for the sake of his maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "Kareem is close to his brother and certainly feels for his
brother and would like to see him get back on track. [But], he's the
kind of kid who's going to keep moving, either way."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Kareem said, there was so much to gain from
another year of college, not to mention another year between draft
days for the family that might have one more ahead of it.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon, a sophomore at Westport High in Kansas City, could be
better than his older brothers, according to Glenda Rush.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the word around the city," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But....</TE>
<TE>   "I learned," Kareem said, "that everything doesn't work out the
way you want it to."</TE>

<LD>Craig Dunkin's letter last Saturday regarding the World Cup had a
nice ring to it, but it is inescapable that the game will never catch
on in the U.S. as a spectator sport. Germany beat us with two shots
on goal! I don't need an electrifying slam dunk from Kobe or another
dinger from Shawn Green. I'll take Derek Fisher drawing a charge, or
a David Eckstein sacrifice bunt (of course another grand slam would
be even better) over "the world's game."</LD>

<HD>If You Want a Response, Say Chick Should Quit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The issue of whether Chick Hearn should stay with the Lakers or
retire is probably moot. Broadcasters who have made as big a mark on
their sport as have star players--and Hearn is in this category--are
more or less allowed to exit when they decide it's time.</LD>
<LD>   When I first began broadcasting some 30 years ago, Chick was an
idol, and I was just as mesmerized by his rapid-fire patter and
"Chickisms" as everybody else was. But over the years, the act grew a
bit stale and Hearn's occasionally grating personality took its toll.
Everything hasn't been roses in Chick's life, and the rough edges
have sometimes shown through.</LD>
<LD>   Now, he's not the Chick many of us remember. Unless he really
needs to keep working the mike to put bread on the table, it's time
for the team to give him one more round of recognition and then find
the best talent available to start a new era.</LD>
<TE>   Chick faked Father Time "into the popcorn machine" for more years
than anyone else in his profession. Thanks for the memories.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Roberts</TE>
<TE>   Guam</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rather than roast Chickie Baby for what was admittedly a rough and
ragged ceremony, I'd take issue with what seemed to be a total lack
of stage management. Clearly, no one was coordinating the players'
arrivals, giving Hearn cues or reminding him that he'd strayed
off-list and forgotten to announce Lindsey Hunter (and who can really
blame him--looks like Phil Jackson forgot Lindsey once the playoffs
started anyway).</TE>
<TE>   It's stating the clearly obvious to say that Chick has deserved
whatever part he wishes to play in any Laker ceremony. An easy
answer? Don't forget Chick's right-hand man, Stu Lantz. I did find it
curious that he was left out of the ceremony altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Enough, guys. You've got until just about this time next year to
get it worked out.</TE>

<HD>The Short Life, and Sad Death, of Darryl Kile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sadly, two words might have saved Darryl Kile's life had his doctors
been paying attention: Sergei Grinkov.</LD>
<LD>   Grinkov died in 1995, a young man, a strong athlete with no
symptoms, who passed his physicals, and yet there was the warning of
a father who'd died of a heart attack. The lesson is obvious: Any
athlete whose father died of a heart attack needs heart testing
beyond the standard physical. The consequences of non-testing have
become painfully clear--not once now, but twice.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Bixby</LD>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The way The Times is handling the death of Darryl Kile is giving
me " 'roid rage." I am certainly not an expert on steroids and human
growth hormone, but I do read your newspaper, have read a good deal
of the published literature on the subject, and have been involved in
athletics most of my life. I am sure the same is true of many of the
reporters in the sports department. And if it is, why hasn't anyone
tried connecting the dots?</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts Darryl Kile was an admirable father, husband,
teammate and human being; his passing is certainly a sad and horrible
one. Your reporters seem very focused on this human interest, team
dynamics side of that story. But as reporters on the sports beat,
they must know about the ill effects of steroid use.</TE>
<TE>   A Times article Sunday described Darryl Kile as a good high school
pitcher who couldn't get a college scholarship until the summer he
gained 30-40 pounds and his fastball jumped 10 mph. Hello, is anybody
home? Follow the dots. How often do people gain 30-40 pounds of
muscle over the course of the summer through good nutrition and
weightlifting?</TE>

<LD>Monday's quotebook had Tiger Woods saying that he already had won the

year is universally recognized as the "Grand Slam." That being the

criticize Phil Mickelson for being happy about his life and his
accomplishments on the golf course. Here's a young man, 32, who has
won an astonishing 20 times on the PGA Tour, gaining him a lifetime
exemption (make that 21--he has just won the Greater Hartford Open as
I write); has millions of dollars, a private jet, a beautiful wife,
two healthy children, and is ranked second on the planet behind
arguably the best golfer ever to play the game.</TE>

base," she writes. When I finished reading her column, I felt like I
had to puke and I haven't even talked to Tracy!</TE>
<TE>   Her statements regarding the Dodgers' sole possession of first
place for the first time this year are ludicrous. She states, "This
is no accident. This is no fluke." Pucin, that's exactly what it is,
deal with it. Any knowledgeable baseball fan knows that at the end of
the season, the Dodgers will again be in third place, unless Colorado
gets really hot.</TE>
<TE>   Look, the Dodgers' last winning team was 1988, and most would
agree that feat was accomplished with mirrors. However, this team
doesn't even use mirrors. This goes way beyond magic. This phenomenon
goes way beyond luck. There is only one explanation for the Dodgers'
rise to a temporary first-place position--divine intervention.
Nothing else makes sense.</TE>

<TE>   Shame on you, Mr. Noble of Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   There is no "overblown hype" about Dodger Stadium. Nor is Dodger
Stadium "an oversized cement hole dug near a skyline of smog."</TE>
<TE>   My father has been taking my brother and me to Dodger games ever
since I can remember and I never once assessed the facility at Chavez
Ravine with such untrue negative adjectives.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what this life brings--terrorism, disease, starvation,
war--we can always count on having some fun with family and friends
while watching our Dodgers at beautiful Dodger Stadium.</TE>

<LD>I was one of the many fans who stayed away from the track on Sunday,
knowing that Came Home would win and Chris McCarron would go out a
winner. I just didn't think I could handle the drive home with my
glasses fogged from tears. Chris is one of the key reasons that the
Southern California jockey colony is as strong as it is. And it is
time for all of us to pause and thank this man for his contributions
to the sport and for the role model he is for us all.</LD>
<LD>   I recall my last encounter with Chris. I was a fan standing in the
tunnel at Santa Anita as he was riding into the post parade. Someone
hailed him and asked for his time on a Monday or Tuesday. Knowing
those were off-racing days, and that he has a family, I smiled at
Chris as he declined the offer and suggested a race day as an
alternative. He wins because he's a winner. That's what we all Came
Home to Sunday.</LD>

<LD>From the Associated Press: "After Tim Raines' one-out, game-ending
sacrifice fly, Castillo slowly pulled off his batting helmet as his
teammates swarmed Raines and Andy Fox, who scored the winning run."</LD>
<LD>   As the on-deck batter, Castillo was the closest Marlin to home
plate and should have been leading the charge when his teammates
swarmed the field. But then again, I forgot; baseball, like all
professional sports, is no longer about the team, it's about the
individual. It is so bad that Raines even thought to ask his manager
should he swing and try to win the game, or not swing and insure that
Castillo would get another at-bat.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily, for the integrity of the game, Manager Jeff Torborg told
Tim to swing away.</LD>

<TE>   The Times, as well as many other media sources, referred to Luis
Castillo's 35-game hitting streak as a record for a Latino player in
the major leagues. I ask, why do you continue to refer to peoples'
cultures and colors? Maybe if you stopped referring to individuals in
the context of their race, culture and religion, we would stop doing
it as well.</TE>

<HD>Modesto, Visalia Have Met Enemy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When California League rivals Visalia and Modesto open a four-game
series Thursday in Modesto, many fans will cheer for both teams,
opposing players will talk about getting together after the game and
brushback pitches probably won't be thrown.</LD>
<LD>   "I think if we wanted to move one of their guys off the plate,"
Visalia utility man Jason Basil said, "we would get our catcher to
tell them before throwing one high and tight."</LD>
<LD>   Such courtesies will be extended because, in a way, Visalia and
Modesto players are teammates--they are all members of the Oakland
A's farm system.</LD>
<TE>   The arrangement has been in place since 1997, when the Visalia
Oaks became an A's affiliate. The Modesto A's have been an Oakland
team since 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland is baseball's only organization with two minor league
teams in the same league.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys know each other's tendencies," Modesto General Manager
Greg Coleman said. "The games run longer. Guys choose their pitches
wisely."</TE>
<TE>   Basil possesses inside information on both teams after starting
the season at Modesto and being transferred to Visalia about a month
later. The transition was an easy one, Basil said, because players
from both teams attend spring training together.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I went to a brand new team and had to reintroduce
myself to 25 guys," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Basil still associates with his former Modesto teammates--he drove
there during the all-star break to play golf with a few buddies--but
he and other players realize they are competing for the same roster
spots on higher-level clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say you have two star first basemen competing for a spot at
double-A Midland," Coleman said. "There's a little more pressure to
go out and compete."</TE>
<TE>   Visalia's Jennifer Whiteley, the only female general manager in
the California League, said the parent organization does a good job
of balancing talent it gives to each team. For example, A's
first-round draft picks Bobby Crosby and Jeremy Bonderman  were
assigned to Modesto, and Barry Zito went to Visalia when he was
starting out.</TE>
<TE>   The teams didn't exactly tear up the league's Northern Division in
the first half of the season, tying for last place at 34-36, 15 games
behind first-place Stockton. But their upcoming series will be
historic. Coleman said Modesto expects to draw its four-millionth fan
in franchise history during its four games against Visalia.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Nation</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to "The Simpsons," Albuquerque's new triple-A team next
season will probably be nicknamed the Isotopes after local residents
overwhelmingly supported the idea in Internet and radio polls.</TE>
<TE>   The idea stems from an episode of the animated television show in
which Homer Simpson stages a hunger strike to prevent the mayor of
Albuquerque and a beer corporation from stealing his hometown minor
league team, the Springfield Isotopes.</TE>
<TE>   Although many longtime Albuquerque residents wanted the team to
retain the Dukes nickname it had used during its run as a Dodger
affiliate, General Manager Mel Kowalchuk said the team may be willing
to change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to try a new approach, something different," Kowalchuk
said. '"Let's face it, the young generation is going to dictate
things in the future. It's wise that we listen to what they say,
though we don't always have to act on it."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Young, managing partner of Albuquerque Baseball, is expected
to decide on the nickname by the end of July. Among the possibilities
are the Dukes, 66ers, Roadrunners and Atoms.</TE>
<TE>   The team will have a nickname before it has a major league
affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   The contract between the Florida Marlins and the Calgary Cannons,
the Pacific Coast League team that will relocate to Albuquerque,
expires at the end of this season. Kowalchuk said his club hopes to
sign with a major league team from the West Coast, though it won't be
the Dodgers because they have a triple-A contract with Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   * Freddy Sanchez's 27-game hitting streak--the longest in the
minors in two seasons--ended Tuesday when the Trenton (N.J.)
shortstop was hitless in two at-bats with two walks in a loss to
Reading in the first game of a doubleheader. Sanchez, who attended
Burbank High and College of the Canyons, hit a solo home run in the
second game.</TE>
<TE>   Angels' System</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake outfielder Robb Quinlan's franchise-record 21-game
hitting streak ended June 21 against Las Vegas, but his bat sizzled
again two days later when he hit two home runs and drove in three
runs against Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Quinlan, 25, hit .444 during the streak and increased his batting
average from .298 to .343. He has a team-leading 13 home runs heading
into the weekend. His career high is 14.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Chone Figgins, whose 20-game hitting streak ended
Thursday, set a franchise single-season record with his 11th triple
Tuesday against Iowa. He also leads the Pacific Coast League with 23
stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers' System</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Orlando Rodriguez has continued his masterful work
since being promoted to Class-A Vero Beach (Fla.) shortly before the
all-star break. The reliever has pitched only three innings for his
new team but has yet to yield a run this season--earned or
otherwise--in 31 1/3 combined innings at South Georgia and Vero
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, acquired from the Chicago White Sox last May as part of
a five-player deal, went 3-0 at South Georgia, striking out 42 and
walking 10 in 28 1/3 innings. His fastball, which reaches the
mid-90s, is especially impressive considering his 5-foot-10,
155-pound frame.</TE>

<HD>Karros Has Unleashed a Productive Season Even Without a Lot
of Homers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Karros says now that his reaction to the meeting with Manager
Jim Tracy was one of shock and disappointment.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't angry as much as annoyed.</LD>
<LD>   It never occurred to him, he says in reflection, that he was being
graded in spring training.</LD>
<TE>   All he was trying to do, in the aftermath of a painful 2001 season
and an off-season dedicated to correcting the back problem that had
pulled the plug on his power and production, was stay healthy and
recapture his timing for the start of the new season.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy and General Manager Dan Evans had other thoughts, though,
when they met with Karros during the last week of the Dodgers' 2002
spring bivouac.</TE>
<TE>   Their 34-year-old first baseman was coming off his worst
season--.235 average, 15 home runs, 63 runs batted in--and was about
to finish the exhibition schedule with a .190 average, no home runs
and three doubles, which had them nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 'concerned' would be the best word," Tracy said, looking
back.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, looking back from the perspective of a promising
half-season, said he didn't consider what he is doing now to be
redemption as much as surviving.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew coming out of spring training that I wasn't going to be
given a very long leash," he added. "There was no question that a lot
of people had written me off, had doubts about me, including the guy
sitting in that [manager's] office right over there.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew, with the impression people had, considering the emphasis
they were putting on my spring numbers, I'd better get off to a
decent start or it would be a very long year. I knew the leash
wouldn't stretch very far."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, though, might have stretched the leash farther than
skeptics would have predicted.</TE>
<TE>   He opened the season hitting seventh--"That was a blow to the ego
right out of the chute," he said--and is now hitting fourth, which is
not to say he is the same middle-of-the-order power hitter who
slugged 31 homers in 2000 and 34 in 1999, driving in 218 runs in
those two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is he the power-emphasizing hitter who averaged 27 homers and
93 RBIs while batting .270 for nine consistent seasons before the
back problems of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of Karros as cleanup hitter in a lineup that had
been a work in progress and has helped bolt the Dodgers into the
National League West lead stems basically from two factors:</TE>
<TE>   * Reacting to what he believes to be Tracy's vision of his
offensive personnel and attack, Karros has tried to become a more
disciplined contact hitter, one who cuts down on his swing and
strikeouts, uses the entire field but is still focused on driving in
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "[I] can be more beneficial on the type club we have now by just
putting the ball in play, moving runners, keeping an inning going
instead of swinging for the fences," he said. "Which is not to say
there won't be times when I try to go for it."</TE>
<TE>   * Among the Dodgers, with Mike Piazza, Raul Mondesi and Gary
Sheffield playing elsewhere, only Shawn Green has the capability to
carry a club for more than a few games at a time, leaving the manager
with few cleanup options other than Karros, whose adjustment to his
new approach convinced Tracy he could still be productive in the
middle, even if he wasn't hitting 30 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers reach the midpoint of a 162-game schedule Sunday, and
Karros has eight home runs and 38 RBIs--far below his pre-2001
production. But he is batting .303 ( his career high is .304 in
1999), has a .328 average with runners on base, a .329 average with
runners in scoring position, and has struck out only 34 times in 274
at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw in spring training would not have correlated to what
we've seen since the season started," Tracy said. "I like what the
man is doing right now.</TE>
<TE>   "Hypothetically, if he hits 14 or 15 home runs, great. If he
continues to get up in bases-loaded situations and they make that
tough slider pitch down and away and he continues to hit line drives
over the second baseman's head, I like that player more than the guy
who was hitting 30 home runs and batting .257 and striking out over
100 times because how many of those strikeouts ended rallies? And how
many of the 30 homers were hit like those singles with the games on
the line?</TE>
<TE>   "We would not be [20] games over .500 without his production and
he's sent a very loud message, to me and everybody who witnessed what
he did in the spring, as to what kind of professional he is."</TE>
<TE>   Karros smiled, amused by the irony.</TE>
<TE>   There were all those years when he thought he could have hit .300
if he had wanted but considered batting average to be "one of the
most overrated statistics in baseball." His primary responsibility,
he believed, was producing decent power numbers, ultimately becoming
the L.A. Dodgers' career leader in home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "Could I still hit 30 home runs if I wanted?" Karros, a career
.269 hitter, asked. "Without question. But I'd probably throw in 120
strikeouts too, and right now, where I'm on a pace for 70 or 80
strikeouts, I think that helps this club more.</TE>
<TE>   "I also knew that if I came out hitting a few home runs and
batting .250, a lot of people around here would have said I was done.
I didn't want to contribute to that and I don't think I could have
handled another year like last year mentally.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to go out sitting on the bench. I want to go out on
top, with the club winning. I've been around .300 most of the time,
tried to stay consistent, and feel like I'm playing better than I
have in the last few years."</TE>
<TE>   Karros is owed $8 million next year and the club has a $9-million
option or $1-million buyout in 2004. He put himself in position to
confront the skeptics through his off-season work with Vancouver
therapist Alex McKechnie and believes his balance at the plate and
flexibility at first base have improved.</TE>
<TE>   How far his new approach takes him, however, remains a daily
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   He'd had only four hits in his last 26 at-bats as he faced the
Angels on Friday night, but he has continued to make contact and he
continues to delight in the team's performance and chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   Karros is seldom without a smile, in the clubhouse or dugout.
Maybe no one could have predicted how that part of it would develop,
but he thought of his spring meeting with Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that by the end of the year, I'd be hitting fifth,"
Karros said. "We had Green and [Paul] Lo Duca coming off great years,
so I didn't say I'd be hitting fourth, but I did predict he'd be
hitting me in the middle of the order and he looked at me and said,
'I hope you're right,' but I don't think he or anybody believed</TE>
<TE>   it.</TE>
<TE>   "His attitude seemed to be, 'You've got to be kidding me, after
what I've been watching.' But again, I didn't know I was being graded
on what I was doing in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   The batting order is one measure of his midseason grade.</TE>
<TE>   Another?</TE>
<TE>   "He's put all the concern to bed," Tracy said. "The leash is a
little longer."</TE>

<HD>Chambers Defeats Greene; Jones Wins Again at Oslo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dwain Chambers was at his best Friday night, beating Maurice Greene
and Tim Montgomery in the men's 100 meters at the Bislett Games at
Oslo.</LD>
<LD>   Greene, the world-record holder, rocketed out of the blocks and
took the early lead.</LD>
<LD>   But the Olympic and world champion couldn't hold off Chambers and
lost by .01 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Chambers, of Britain, won the race in a relatively slow 10.05
seconds. Montgomery, second to Greene in last week's U.S.
Championships, finished third in 10.10.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers also beat Greene last year in a meet in Glasgow,
Scotland. This time, however, the field was much stronger, one of the
best ever in the 100 at storied Bislett Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's competition, Marion Jones won the 100 meters for
the seventh time at the Bislett Games. Jones, third out of the
blocks, took the lead well before the halfway point and held on to
win in 10.96 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, coming off a winning time of 11.01 at the U.S.
Championships in California last weekend, finished .17 ahead of
Jamaica's Tayna Lawrence. Chryste Gaines, second to Jones at Stanford
last weekend, was third in 11.20.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Devers bettered her Bislett Stadium record in the 100 hurdles
by 0.03, winning in 12.53.</TE>
<TE>   American Toby Stevenson was taken to a hospital after he fell on
the track in the pole vault. Stevenson fell after missing his last
attempt at 18 feet, 2 inches. He was able to walk from the stadium
and organizers said Stevenson was not seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   Olympics</TE>
<TE>   The Greek government at Athens defended a decision to scale back a
number of Olympic sports venues because of high costs, describing
some of the projects as unneeded luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   Greece's Olympic Committee also admitted that a project to
refurbish a soccer stadium had fallen through. An alternate site for
the final match in one of the Games' premier events has not been
found.</TE>
<TE>   Athens 2004 chief Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki has said Greece
hopes to save from $180 million to $285 million by reducing the scope
of some venues--most located at Athens' old Hellenikon international
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Philippe Boucher is not expected to re-sign with the
Kings this weekend and will become an unrestricted free agent Monday,
his agent said.</TE>
<TE>   "You get this chance maybe once in a lifetime," agent Pat Brisson
said from Montreal, "and he's obviously looking forward to testing
the market."</TE>
<TE>   Brisson said there is "maybe a 50-50 chance" that Boucher will
stay with the Kings, adding that he and the team "really haven't
spoken in the last 10 days."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, 29, is eligible for unrestricted free agency because he
has played in the NHL for 10 seasons and, at $582,038 last season,
was paid less than the league average, which was about $1.5 million.
He is seeking an average yearly salary of about $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Steve Duchesne changed his mind minutes before a
midnight deadline and decided not to exercise a contract option that
would have kept him with the Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   Red Wing General Manager Ken Holland said late Thursday that
Duchesne had exercised an option worth $1 million to stay with the
team for the 2002-03 season.</TE>
<TE>   Duchesne chose not to exercise the option just before the deadline
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   If Duchesne and the Red Wings do not reach an agreement by Sunday
night, the 16-year veteran would become a free agent Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   UCLA men's basketball player Ryan Hollins, a 6-foot-11 freshman
from Pasadena Muir High who was released from a letter-of-intent by
Saint Louis, will be eligible for the 2003-04 season, although he has
appealed to the NCAA to gain eligibility next season.</TE>

<HD>Taylor Gambles, Reds Lose</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Outfielder gets caught stealing in the ninth, and
St. Louis holds off Cincinnati, 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>One night after Reggie Taylor got a big hit for the Cincinnati Reds,
he made a huge mistake.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis catcher Mike Matheny threw out Taylor trying to steal
third for the second out of the ninth inning, helping St. Louis
finish off a 3-2 victory Friday in a showdown for first place in the
National League Central.</LD>
<LD>   Taylor's two-out, two-run triple in the ninth inning Thursday
against the Chicago Cubs sent that game into extra innings, and
Cincinnati won, 5-4, in the 10th.</LD>
<TE>   This time, Taylor was too aggressive on the bases.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a good jump, but he made a perfect throw," said Taylor, who
was running on his own. "I took a gamble and lost the game for us. If
I'm safe, it's a great play, but I'm out and it's the worst play in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Simontacchi pitched seven impressive innings, and Placido
Polanco hit a tiebreaking RBI double in the seventh for St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols drove in two runs for the Cardinals, who had lost
three of four after the death of pitcher Darryl Kile. They are 7-3
against Cincinnati and two games ahead in the division after ending
the Reds' three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right there fighting for first place," Polanco said. "Every
game's going to be important."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Isringhausen hit Taylor with a pitch leading off the ninth,
and he was sacrificed to second. But after Matheny's throw caught
Taylor, pinch-hitter Austin Kearns' single was wasted.</TE>
<TE>   Isringhausen struck out Todd Walker for his 17th save in 19
chances. The closer recovered after his second blown save the night
before, giving up two runs in the ninth inning of an 11-inning loss
to the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   "After a blown save, it's always nice to go out and get one so you
can get rid of those memories from the night before," Isringhausen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Encarnacion hit a two-run homer, his 15th, in the fourth for
the Reds. Encarnacion has 13 hits in his last 30 at-bats.</TE>

<HD>Let These Rookies Beware</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It lacks the rumbling flair of a Cadillac SUV and the gaudy sparkle
of dime-sized diamond studs, but the latest must-have item for NFL
rookies might be worth more than both: a document shredder.</LD>
<LD>   "The dumpster divers can steal a lot of information," said Milt
Ahlerich, a former FBI executive now the NFL's senior director of
security. "Once you've been victimized, it's very hard to undo."</LD>
<LD>   The crime is called identity theft, the hijacking of someone's
personal information such as credit card or Social Security numbers
and using them to steal or commit fraud. It is one of the country's
fastest-growing crimes, and, Ahlerich said, the number of NFL
players, coaches and executives burned by the scam has increased
dramatically during the last three years. He said his office receives
at least one call a week from someone whose information has fallen
into the wrong hands.</LD>
<TE>   Identity theft was the leading consumer-fraud complaint reported
last year, accounting for 42% of the 204,000 complaints received by
the Federal Trade Commission. According to privacy advocates, as many
as 750,000 Americans may be victims of the crime each year.</TE>
<TE>   Ahlerich was a featured speaker at the NFL rookie symposium
earlier this week at the La Costa Resort and Spa. The four-day
seminar was mandatory for all drafted rookies and covered an array of
subjects, from HIV awareness, to dealing with the media, to sniffing
out unscrupulous financial advisors. Among the speakers were Denver
Coach Mike Shanahan; veteran players such as Keyshawn Johnson, John
Lynch, Marcellus Wiley and Troy Vincent; and some second-year players
a year removed from the symposium.</TE>
<TE>   "This is some stuff we didn't learn in college," said Buffalo
rookie Mike Williams, drafted fourth overall. "You go from your
parents' house to college and you've been shielded. This is bringing
us into the real world."</TE>
<TE>   Danny Wuerffel, the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner, got a real-world
reminder two years ago when he was a backup quarterback in Green Bay.
He got a call from the Home Depot credit department, asking if he had
just applied for a $16,000 home-improvement loan at a store in South
Plainfield, N.J. He had not.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, a scam artist had applied for the loan using Wuerffel's
name, birth date and Social Security number. He aroused suspicion,
though, when he misspelled Destin, Fla., where the player lives in
the off-season. It escaped notice that the impostor was described as
a slender black man in his mid-30s. Wuerffel, then 26, is white, 6
feet 1 and 212 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see a 5-foot-1 guy standing in line at a club,
dressed in Carolina blue, with a big cubic zirconium in his ear,
talking about, 'I'm Julius Peppers,' " Matt Couloute Jr., NFL
security player liaison, said in a conference room full of rookies
Monday. The gathering included the real Peppers, a 6-6 defensive end
drafted No. 2 by the Carolina Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   Couloute, a former prosecutor, told the players they should not
only use a shredder to dispose of unnecessary personal documents, but
to avoid using the mailboxes at their houses or apartments and
instead use the post office. He also urged players to routinely get
credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   Ahlerich said, "We've gotten very proactive about it. We've done a
lot to educate people."</TE>
<TE>   There might have been a spike of activity in recent years, but
impersonating NFL players is nothing new. Hall of Fame cornerback
Mike Haynes, who oversaw the rookie symposium in his role as NFL vice
president of player and employee development, said he once was
victimized by such a scam.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a guy who ran up a bill on my credit card in Europe,"
he said. "I hadn't even been to Europe at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Among the more brazen NFL impersonators:</TE>
<TE>   * A man in Tampa, Fla., bilked several women out of more than
$2,000 last year by assuming the identities of Buccaneer receiver
Jacquez Green and Cedric King, brother of Tampa Bay quarterback Shaun
King.</TE>
<TE>   * Two years ago, a man in St. Louis pleaded guilty to using a
false Social Security number, other false identification and claiming
to be then-Ram linebacker London Fletcher. The impostor racked up
more than $30,000 in hospital bills and told hospital officials the
Rams or NFL insurance would pay for the treatment. The reason for the
treatments was not disclosed. The man was thoughtful enough to sign
autographs for fellow patients from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   * In 1999, a 6-7, 305-pound Nebraska man posed first as 49er tight
end Chad Fann, then as Bengal tackle Jamain Stephens, to receive free
hotel rooms, meals and limousine rides in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Ashmore, now an offensive lineman for the Raiders, was
burned by an impostor in 1993, during his second season with the
then-Los Angeles Rams. A man claiming to be Ashmore spent his nights
bar-hopping in L.A., slamming down free drinks, picking up women, and
selling leather jackets and bogus Super Bowl tickets. The man also
opened a checking account in Ashmore's name and somehow learned his
Social Security number--although it turned out he was one number off.
NFL security and the FBI tried to track down the impostor, but
Ashmore caught up to him first.</TE>
<TE>   "We wound up in the same bar," Ashmore said a few years ago.
"Somebody pointed him out to me and I went up to him and said, 'Hey,
you need to stop.' He said, 'Nah, it's not me. That's the guy who was
doing it.' He pointed to one of his friends. I went to get the
bouncer and the manager and, the next thing you know, the guy fled
with his friend.... " The part Ashmore found most galling: "He was a
big, sloppy guy about 6-3, 300. He looked like he hadn't played a
lick of football in his life." Eventually, the phony was nabbed by
NFL security, arrested and brought to trial, where, Ashmore said, "He
got a slap on the wrist."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the man did not abandon his scheme and a few
months later was arrested in Las Vegas for impersonating former
Arizona Cardinal defensive lineman Michael Bankston.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about [the impostor] is, he came from a good family and
a good upbringing, but he played this game," Ashmore said. "This was
his full-time job, going out to nightclubs every night of the week.
Kind of sickening, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   The experience made Ashmore much more wary about signing
autographs and telling people too much about himself. He signs
footballs from time to time, but not the same way he signs his
checks.</TE>
<TE>   "When I sign an autograph, you really can't read it," he said. "I
can't read my own writing. I sign my checks where it's really nice
handwriting, where you can read every letter. You really can't
protect yourself against a lot of things. In the computer age, anyone
can get anything now. You never know."</TE>

<LD>There are many reasons, of course, why American football--also known
in this part of the world as "helmet football" or "gridiron" or
"sumos in shoulder pads"--will never match the global popularity of
its older, subtler cousin.</LD>
<LD>   Too much cumbersome equipment.</LD>
<LD>   (American football players wear protective gear on their heads, in
their mouths, around their necks, over their shoulders, in front of
their kidneys, around their hips, over their thighs and on their
knees. Everywhere, basically, except the shins, which is the only
part of the anatomy global football players see fit to pad.)</LD>
<TE>   Too many delays in the action.</TE>
<TE>   (Delays for huddles. Delays for incomplete passes. Delays for
first downs. Delays to allow the doubled-over defensive lineman time
to catch his breath after trudging eight yards and flopping on top of
the opposing fullback. Far too much stoppage.)</TE>
<TE>   Not enough sex appeal.</TE>
<TE>   (Ask the women of the world whom they'd rather spend an evening
with--David Beckham or David Carr? Answer the women of the world when
they reply: a) "Who's David Carr?" b) "Where's Houston?" and c)
"What's a Texan?")</TE>
<TE>   The bowl championship series.</TE>
<TE>   (Try explaining that one to a Brazilian. "You mean to say you get
run off the field in group play, you disgrace yourselves, your
family, your community and your country ... and after all this, you
advance to the final?")</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it never would have taken American football 72
years to figure out a way to put its two best teams on the same field
during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup, proving conclusively that it does get around to all
things eventually, will bring the two most storied teams in its
history, Brazil and Germany, together for the first time in 17
tournaments in Sunday's final at Yokohama International Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That's right. Four-time champion Brazil, top-ranked in all-time
World Cup winning percentage, and three-time champion Germany, ranked
No. 2, are finally playing each other in a World Cup game after
having played 170 World Cup matches against everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   When this incredible statistic first began filtering through the
press centers of Japan and South Korea, the international soccer
media, for the first time on record, had the same reaction.</TE>
<TE>   How did that happen?</TE>
<TE>   Before this tournament, the World Cup had staged 16 finals. Brazil
had appeared in six. Germany had appeared in six. Since World War II,
either Brazil or Germany had appeared in every final except the one
in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   But never in the same final. Or in the same group game, or in the
same second-round match, or in the same quarterfinal or semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   "For football fans, it's a dream final," says Oliver Kahn, the
redoubtable German goalkeeper. "It's the final everyone had been
hoping for."</TE>
<TE>   A Rio de Janeiro newspaper, Une O Globo, is calling it "the final
of all cups ... the most-awaited World Cup final in history."</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is necessarily a good thing. How long a wait is too
long a wait?</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the Cowboys and the Redskins of international soccer.
Two programs that once ruled their sport, but now look, feel and
smell well past their pull dates. Two old-school powers that peaked
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   Except the Cowboys and the Redskins have been known to meet in the
tournament from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   Where was this final in 1970, when Pele and Franz Beckenbauer were
at the height of their skills, instead of playing the roles of
grouchy middle-aged men complaining about the substandard Brazilian
and German play at every stage of this tournament?</TE>
<TE>   Or how about in 1986, when Rudi Voeller was scoring highlight-reel
goals for Germany, instead of sitting in dark film rooms, devising
ways to choke the life out of every World Cup match his team has
played in Asia?</TE>
<TE>   It should have happened in 1970, when both Brazil and Germany
reached the semifinals. Brazil advanced with a 3-1 victory over
Uruguay, but Germany, hitting the wall in ugly fashion during a hot
Mexican summer, coughed up three overtime goals to Italy and fell
short of the final, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   It should have happened in 1986, when the Germans reached the
semifinals and waited for Brazil to join them. But Zico missed a
penalty shot in the second half, Socrates missed an open net in
overtime and Brazil lost in a shootout, France going on to play
Germany instead.</TE>
<TE>   And it might have happened in 1958, when a 17-year-old Pele led
Brazil to its first world championship. Germany reached the
semifinals, where it scored the first goal against Sweden, but
surrendered two goals in the last 10 minutes and wound up playing
instead in the third-place match.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from that, Brazil and Germany, the yin and yang of global
soccer, had never come close to meeting in a World Cup. Most often,
they were victims of their own talent and reputations--seeded into
different first-round groups and slotted into opposite later-round
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Timing has also been a problem. Brazil hit its 1990s upswing,
reaching the '94 and '98 finals, just as Germany's Lothar
Matthaeus-Jurgen Klinsmann champions of '90 began showing their age.
Germany reached three consecutive finals--in 1982, '86 and '90--while
Brazil was mired in its blue period, in the midst of a 24-year,
no-finals slump.</TE>
<TE>   Now they've both finally made it, finally broken through to the
same side, and the prevailing mood is more exhaustion than
excitement.</TE>
<TE>   We're tired of watching Brazil make eye-popping mistakes in the
back, of surrendering the ball in the midfield, of peppering Turkey's
goal with all sorts of shots from all sorts of ranges and converting
only one--an ad-libbed toe-poke that Ronaldo all but apologized for.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a marvelous side," Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said
of his squad after the 1-0 semifinal victory in Saitama, "but it's
competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Not flamboyant. Not artistic. Not imaginative. Competitive.</TE>
<TE>   We've also grown tried of watching Germany do just enough--and
nothing more--to eke out 1-0 victories over the likes of Paraguay,
the United States and South Korea. Keep lobbing in the long balls,
hope someone wearing a white shirt gets a head on one of them, turn
the thing over to Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   "Germany is a traditional, cold, calculating team," Scolari said.
"That's why we have an enormous amount of respect for them."</TE>
<TE>   But is that the kind of team soccer wants hoisting its biggest
prize Sunday?</TE>
<TE>   And is the other option, a faded replica of a musty old
masterpiece, any more preferable?</TE>
<TE>   It has taken the World Cup 72 years to bring Brazil and Germany to
this stage. After the last ball is kicked inside Yokohama
International Stadium, will the waiting be remembered as the hardest
part? Or the watching?</TE>

<HD>Collina a Choice Selection</HD>
<DH>Soccer: As referee for Brazil-Germany final, Italian has
the respect of players and coaches as the best at what he does.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>As far as whistle-blowers go, they don't come much better than
Pierluigi Collina.</LD>
<LD>   The Italian referee is generally acknowledged to be the finest in
the world, a man abundantly qualified to take charge of Sunday's
World Cup final between Brazil and Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Cast in the fiery furnace of Italy's Serie A, arguably the most
difficult league in the world in which to officiate, Collina, 42, has
made himself internationally known.</LD>
<TE>   In part, that's because of his looks. He is one of very few
referees in the world whose photograph in a newspaper or magazine
needs no caption. His bald dome and his intense, almost glaring,
stare together make an unforgettable impression.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, however, is his ability to stamp his authority
on a game without ruining it. Firm but fair, he has the respect of
players and coaches alike. Small wonder, then, that when there is a
significant and potentially troublesome match to be officiated,
Collina is the first to be called.</TE>
<TE>   He had charge, for instance, of the gold-medal game between
Argentina and Nigeria at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. He was also
the man in the middle when Manchester United scored twice in the
final minutes to defeat Bayern Munich in the classic 1999 European
Champions Cup final in Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   German fans will remember him, too, as the referee in Munich last
September when England routed Germany, 5-1, in a World Cup qualifying
game.</TE>
<TE>   At this tournament, he handled the prickly England-Argentina
first-round match in Sapporo, Japan, with ease. Once Italy was
eliminated, "Kojak" Collina, as he is known, became the overwhelming
choice to referee the final.</TE>
<TE>   One measure of the high regard in which he is held came earlier
this week when Brazil's coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, laughed off any
suggestion that Collina might somehow be biased for Germany because
he does commercials for a German sports equipment manufacture.</TE>
<TE>   While FIFA fumbled with the question, Scolari dismissed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping it would be him," Scolari said. "He's a spectacular
referee. Everybody likes him. The players like him and I like him. I
am very satisfied.... The fact that he has done commercials for
Adidas has nothing to do with anything. I have also done commercials.
We both made a bit of money. That's all."</TE>
<TE>   Married with two daughters, Collina lives in the Italian coastal
town of Viareggio, where he counts basketball among his main
interests and closely follows the fortunes of Fortituda Bologna. A
financial consultant by profession, he earned an economics degree
from the University of Bologna in 1984, and is fluent in half a dozen
languages.</TE>
<TE>   He has his own Web site, www.pierluigicollina.it, where he answers
questions from referees around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is not to change the game but make it work to everyone's
satisfaction," he told World Soccer magazine. "But the priority must
be to protect the most skillful footballers from violent play and
crack down on diving."</TE>
<TE>   At a World Cup where the officiating has justifiably come under
more intense scrutiny than ever after a series of bad calls, Collina
has been a beacon in the darkness for the men with the whistles.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Don't Let Up at Phoenix</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Playing on consecutive nights, six L.A.
players reach double figures in 84-72 victory over Mercury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>It would have been easy for the Sparks to take the night off.</LD>
<LD>   Their legs were probably still heavy after Thursday's taut home
victory over the Washington Mystics and the morning flight to the
Valley of the Sun. Plus, Houston, the Sparks' closest pursuer in the
Western Conference, is coming to Staples Center on Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   So for Coach Michael Cooper, what was the most satisfying aspect
of the Sparks' 84-72 victory over the Phoenix Mercury, before 8,596
at the America West Arena?</LD>
<TE>   Was it seeing six players in double figures, led by Lisa Leslie
with 18 points and 14 rebounds? Getting 20 assists to counterbalance
19 turnovers? Was it the Sparks' overall 45-28 rebounding edge, which
meant the Mercury--which shot 36.8% for the game--had few extra
attempts? Or rookie point guard Nikki Teasley, with 12 points and six
assists, playing her best game as a pro?</TE>
<TE>   How about all of the above? Each factor was linked to the Sparks
(12-1) being able to extend their current winning streak to nine, and
beat the Mercury (7-5) for the second time in four days.</TE>
<TE>   "[Passing] the ball and rebounding the ball have been the keys to
our success this year," Cooper said. "When we move the ball, we get
good looks. When we rebound the ball, we can get out and run. And I
thought we did a good job after playing a tough game yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about Teasley, Cooper, who has been her biggest
supporter, wore a bigger smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think it was a coming-out party tonight," Cooper
said. "She's starting to understand how to score and when to score in
the offense."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, who has been grateful for the Sparks' patience with her
progress, didn't want to call Friday's effort her best, but the
rookie passed another test by playing heavy minutes in back-to-back
games. "There's been so much to learn, and tonight was another
learning experience," said Teasley. "But I'm getting more confident."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Leslie and Teasley, the Sparks got 14 points from
Mwadi Mabika, 13 from DeLisha Milton, 12 from Latasha Byears and 11
from Tamecka Dixon. Milton added 13 rebounds. Said Leslie of Phoenix:
"I think they had, what, seven rebounds in the second half? That's
the game right there."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix, which was playing its second game under interim coach
Linda Sharp after the resignation of Cynthia Cooper on Wednesday,
made some headway when it ran. Former Spark guard Gordana Grubin
finished with a career-high 23 points and Jennifer Gillom had 16
points for Phoenix, but when L.A. switched to a matchup zone the
Mercury settled for jump shots and fell behind, 45-40, at halftime.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Beats Croatia Behind Azevedo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Achilles' heel of the U.S. men's water polo team has been its
play in the final quarter of important international games.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. didn't have that problem Friday night against Croatia in
the opening game of the inaugural FINA World Water Polo League,
taking a four-goal lead early in the fourth quarter and winning,
15-13, at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Center.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Azevedo scored seven goals for the Americans, who earned
three points with the victory and some additional confidence heading
into a rematch with the Croatians on Sunday at the U.S. training
headquarters in Los Alamitos.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel like we were definitely tested," said Azevedo, 20, who was
the youngest member of the 2000 Olympic team that finished sixth in
Sydney. "We made a lot of mistakes out there in the fourth quarter,
but we still won by two goals. That shows a lot of character."</TE>
<TE>   Azevedo said the U.S. isn't so concerned about winning as gaining
international experience and playing well in the closing minutes. The
United States hasn't won an Olympic medal since 1988, but U.S. Coach
Ratko Rudic, who was hired after the 2000 Games, believes playing
more games against high-caliber competition will help end the
drought.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Sunday's game against Croatia, the U.S. will host
Russia twice next week and Hungary for two games later next month.
The U.S. will then play the same three teams in their countries.</TE>
<TE>   The top two teams from the four-team U.S. bracket, along with two
teams from a second bracket, will advance to the Super Final in
Patras, Greece, in August.</TE>

<HD>Reyna Earns Spot on All-Star Team</HD>
<DH>Soccer: U.S. midfielder, who led team to quarterfinals, is
one of 16 players selected. Four Brazilians picked.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>First the American team upset Portugal. Later, it won its first
knockout-round game. Now, the United States has its first World Cup
all-star.</LD>
<LD>   Midfielder Claudio Reyna was among 16 players voted to the
all-star team of the 2002 World Cup by the FIFA Technical Study
Group.</LD>
<LD>   Josef Venglos, the head of the group, noted the improvement Reyna
has made and praised his ability to organize the midfield and his
physical fitness.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a great honor and I'm flattered to be included amongst a
list of such great players," Reyna said in a statement released by
the U.S. Soccer Federation. "This type of award is all about the
team, and obviously all of our guys deserve recognition for the kind
of performances we put on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very proud of how we represented the United States at this
World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, now with the Galaxy, was named
one of nine honorable mention picks after FIFA selected a first team
of 11. The last two World Cups, FIFA has selected only one team of
16.</TE>
<TE>   Other midfielders selected with Reyna were Rivaldo and Ronaldinho
of Brazil, Yoo Sang-Chul of South Korea and Michael Ballack of
Germany, who scored the game-winning goal against the United States
in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Pele, who earlier in the tournament tabbed England's Nicky Butt as
the top player in the field, now has a new pick.</TE>
<TE>   "Butt was a good player, but Ronaldinho is the one who surprises
me," said the Brazilian soccer legend, who serves as a consultant to
the TSG.</TE>
<TE>   Two strikers from Sunday's final headline the selections up front.
Ronaldo and Miroslav Klose will meet when Brazil and Germany play in
the 17th World Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal's El Hadji Diouf and Turkey's Hasan Sas round out the
group of forwards.</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Oliver Kahn, who has given up one goal in his team's six
matches, was chosen for the goalkeeper position, along with Turkey's
Rustu Recber, whose heroics helped the Turks reach the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Roberto Carlos, England's Sol Campbell, South Korea's
Hong Myung-Bo, Turkey's Alpay Ozalan and Spain's Fernando Hierro were
the selections on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Only players from nations that reached the quarterfinals were
eligible to make the team.</TE>

<LD>It takes a star of great magnitude to go by a single name, like Cher,
or Madonna . . . or almost any Brazilian soccer player. But while the
nicknames may be easier to deal with than the players' long full
names, they can get confusing when they sound too much alike. Here's
a handy guide for Sunday's championship game:</LD>
<LD>   Edmilson #5</LD>
<LD>   Full name: Jose Gomes de Moraes Edmilson. A central defender who
plays in France for Olympique Lyonnaise. Has stood out in support of
defenders Cafu and Roberto Carlos, and made highlight reels with his
bicycle kick for a goal against Costa Rica in the first round.</LD>
<TE>   Edilson #20</TE>
<TE>   Full name: Edilson da Silva Ferreria. Secondary nickname: The
Little Devil. Quick and prone to theatrics, the forward for the
Brazilian club Cruzeiro got a chance to play in the semifinals with
Ronaldinho sitting with two yellow cards. Missed his one shot by
inches, will likely go back to the bench for the final.</TE>
<TE>   Denilson #17</TE>
<TE>   Full name: Denilson de Oliveira. Ahmad Rashad-lookalike who plays
midfield at Real Betis in Spain, he is the team's most creative
dribbler and playmaker. But his flightiness means that Brazil Coach
Luiz Felipe "Big Phil" Scolari will use him only as a reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo #9</TE>
<TE>   Full name: Ronaldo Nazario de Lima. Forward for Inter of Italy, he
is one game away from completing rehabilitation as world's biggest
soccer star, after he was missing in action during the 1998 final.
Went from being over the hill three months ago after a series of
injuries to leading the Cup in goals. Joined the ranks of players who
got unfortunate haircuts during the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo #10</TE>
<TE>   Full name: Rivaldo Borba Ferreira. Stylish forward and attacking
midfielder for Barcelona. Like Ronaldo, a typical Brazilian soccer
success story, born into poverty but went on to be named the world
player of the year in 1999. Not beloved among Brazilian fans because
of sometimes indifferent play. His outstanding performance in the
World Cup may finally win them over.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldinho #11</TE>
<TE>   Full name: Ronaldinho Gaucho de Assas Moreira. Standout midfielder
and forward for Paris St Germain. The 22-year-old is easily
recognized by his long tresses. Has a flair for the dramatic, both
good and bad: he scored the winning goal in the quarterfinals when
his clever free kick caught England's David Seaman off his line, then
picked up a red card that kept him out of the semifinals.</TE>

<HD>Konerko Knocked Down, but Not Out</HD>
<DH>Baseball: First baseman gets beaned, but stays in to hit
two homers to key White Sox's 13-9 win over Cubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Paul Konerko was on his knees in the dirt, still dizzy from being hit
in the head by Kerry Wood's curveball. But when White Sox Manager
Jerry Manuel asked if he wanted to stay in the game, it wasn't a
consideration.</LD>
<LD>   Good thing for the White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   Konerko homered twice after getting plunked, and the White Sox
rallied from an eight-run deficit Friday to beat the Cubs, 13-9, in
front of the largest regular-season crowd at new Comiskey Park.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been hit harder than that in the hands," said Konerko, who
had a bump on the left side of his head after the game. "You know
yourself that you're fine. I wasn't really adamant. It was just, 'I'm
not coming out of the game. I'm fine.' "</TE>
<TE>   He went four for four, his second consecutive four-hit game, and
finished with four runs batted in and four runs scored. It was his
fourth multi-homer game since June 11.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 17 games, he's hitting .439 with 12 homers and 21
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Patterson homered and tied his career best with four RBIs
for the Cubs, whose four-game losing streak is their longest since
dropping nine straight in May.</TE>
<TE>   "No excuses for days like this," said Wood, who is 0-3 against the
White Sox in five starts. "The eight runs should relax a starting
pitcher. But I handed it right back to them."</TE>
<TE>   Losing pitcher Joe Borowski (2-4) gave up two runs and two hits in
2/3 innings. Wood gave up six runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings and
walked five.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox, playing in front of a crowd of 46,027, looked
lackadaisical early. But once Wood hit Konerko in the fourth inning,
it was a new game.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox didn't retaliate against the Cubs after Konerko was
hit but got revenge on offense. Konerko hit a two-run homer in the
fifth that cut the lead to 8-4. In the sixth, Magglio Ordonez's
two-run single tied it, 8-8, then Konerko hit his second homer for a
10-8 lead.</TE>

<HD>Not Much Game Left in the U.S. Men</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Roddick, Dent out. Russia's No. 5 Kafelnikov
ousted. For U.S. women, Granville upsets Pierce.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Age took the hit Wednesday. Youth had two more days of survival at
Wimbledon, but, quite clearly, the U.S. men have been living on the
grassy edge.</LD>
<LD>   After 32-year-old Andre Agassi and 30-year-old Pete Sampras were
eliminated from the tournament in the second round Wednesday, Taylor
Dent, 21, and Andy Roddick, 19, followed them Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras was just awful. Agassi was outplayed. Dent was outserved
by left-hander Wayne Arthurs of Australia in the third round, as was
Roddick by left-hander Greg Rusedski of Britain.</LD>
<TE>   Three rounds have not been completed and one unlikely U.S. male
remains, lucky loser Jeff Morrison. Today, Morrison will play
18th-seeded Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. It is already the
worst performance for the United States at Wimbledon since the Open
era started in 1968. There have been at least two men from the U.S.
in every final 16 at Wimbledon in the Open era.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans haven't been the only upset victims. Friday, No.
5-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia was eliminated by No. 27 Xavier
Malisse of Belgium, 7-6 (4), 7-5, 6-1. Only three of the top 16
seeded players remain: No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, No. 4 Tim Henman and No.
16 Nicolas Escude.</TE>
<TE>   Dent surely deserved a better fate. The Southern Californian lost
to Arthurs without dropping his serve. The 31-year-old Arthurs served
32 aces and double-faulted twice, beating Dent, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-7
(4), 7-6 (5), and has not lost his serve in 54 games. Dent saved a
match point in the third set.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Arthurs drew attention here and earned the
distinction--The Man Who Could Not Be Broken--when he emerged through
qualifying and reached the final 16, winning 111 consecutive service
games before Agassi ended his streak in the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   Dent had one break point through the first three sets, and three
more in the fourth set in the fourth game, with Arthurs serving at
1-2. Here's how Arthurs saved the three: 126-mph ace, 102-mph ace out
wide and 123-mph ace.</TE>
<TE>   In the third set, a frustrated Dent finally cracked one shot past
Arthurs and thrust his arms in the air, and comically ran alongside
of the court, slapping hands with the spectators. He put a finger in
the air, signaling No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so tough to get points off his serve," Dent said. "I feel
like if I got my racket on the ball cleanly, I had a decent shot to
just get the thing back. But 90% of the time, I was shanking them off
into the crowd or getting aced. I think he had something like 35 aces
for a match. That's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The match was played on the intimate Court 3, where Arthurs had a
decided edge in support. There was one Frenchman, chattering nonstop,
who sarcastically cheered for Dent in between expressing his desire
to see Mary Pierce, who was to play next on that court against
qualifier Laura Granville.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like Australia out there, so many bloody Aussies in the
crowd," Arthurs said. "It's unbelievable. The people at the sides are
very close. You can sort of hear everything that everyone says."</TE>
<TE>   But the way Arthurs was serving, nothing would have impaired his
concentration.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting voices were distinctly British during the
Roddick-Rusedski match on Centre Court. Rusedski played flawlessly
and dispatched the No. 11-seeded Roddick with ease, winning, 6-3,
6-4, 6-2, in 1 hour 25 minutes. It is the first time Roddick has
failed to win a set in a match in a Grand Slam event. (At the
Australian Open this year, he retired in the second set of a
second-round match because of an injury.)</TE>
<TE>   Although Roddick has won two titles and reached the semifinals in
Rome on clay, he has stumbled in the majors in 2002, losing in the
first round at the French Open. Roddick appeared to lack a
significant game plan against Rusedski and rarely came close with his
backhand passing shot, smacking it in the middle of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely didn't hit it well enough," Roddick said.
"Seventy-five percent of the time, I wasn't even making him play on
it."</TE>
<TE>   Former player and TV analyst Jim Courier, who is also a U.S. Davis
Cup coach, said he doesn't think Roddick is stagnating or regressing.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take your knocks and have to learn," he said. "That's
what this year is all about. He's the marked man for the first time.
There's no sense of desperation to solidify his place. It's
definitely a question of when, not if, for him."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women fared better. No. 2 Serena Williams survived a
couple of hard-looking spills on the grass and a spirited challenge
from 31-year-old qualifier Els Callens of Belgium, winning, 7-6 (5),
7-6 (2), in 1 hour 39 minutes. Three others advanced to the fourth
round--No. 3 Capriati; Chanda Rubin, who won last week at Eastbourne;
and Granville.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, 21, was the surprise American in the fourth round. She
beat Pierce, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, and has won six matches here, three in
qualifying and three more in the main draw. The 2000 and 2001 NCAA
singles champion from Stanford remembered watching Pierce win the
French Open in 2000 on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's the hardest hitter I've ever played against," said
Granville, who is ranked No. 134. "So I probably should have hit
against a guy yesterday. It was really hard to get a rhythm because
she hits the ball so deep and hard. It took me a set and a half to
really get used to it."</TE>

<LD>Chamique Holdsclaw was on crutches in the Washington Mystics' locker
room.</LD>
<LD>   Over on the Portland Fire's side, Jackie Stiles, placed on injured
reserve before the game, was hobbling around in a walking cast; and
DeMya Walker was with a dentist.</LD>
<LD>   Holdsclaw, the WNBA's leading scorer and rebounder, suffered a
high ankle sprain when her leg was pinned under Walker while the two
battled under the basket during the first half of the Fire's 72-66
victory before 6,761 fans Friday at Portland, Ore.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks like it's not too serious," Mystic Coach Marianne
Stanley said of Holdsclaw's injury. "Right now I really don't know
what the status is, so we'll probably have it re-X-rayed."</TE>
<TE>   Stiles, last season's WNBA rookie of the year, faces possible
season-ending surgery because of bursitis in her right heel. Walker
left the game with a minute remaining when her face collided with the
knee of Washington's Murriel Page.</TE>
<TE>   Portland improved to 6-8. Washington is 10-4.</TE>

<KH>WORLD CUP FINAL BRAZIL VS. GERMANY</KH>
<HD>Nothing but the Best</HD>
<DH>Brazil's Roberto Carlos Holds the Key to Winning This Title</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>If there's one person the Germans have to watch out for in Sunday's
World Cup final, it's the bald guy.</LD>
<LD>   No, not Pierluigi Collina. The Italian referee with the cue-ball
head and the piercing eyes is the least of Germany's worries. He is
probably the most highly respected game official in soccer and the
perfect choice for a Brazil-Germany clash.</LD>
<LD>   No, not Ronaldo, either. The Brazilian striker may be the
tournament's leading goal scorer, but he doesn't really qualify as
bald anymore, at least not since he let that peculiar Chia-pet
half-circle of hair sprout on the front of his head.</LD>
<TE>   The person the Germans should fear comes from farther back in the
Brazilian pack. He lurks in the left back position, waiting to either
create or score the goal that will give the South Americans a record
fifth world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Carlos is his name, and in this tournament he once again
has demonstrated why he is the best attacking outside back in the
world today.</TE>
<TE>   The thing about Roberto Carlos--the name is singular, even though
it has two halves--is that he can hurt you in so many ways.</TE>
<TE>   There's his speed. The man can be at one end of the field, sending
in a cross for Ronaldo or Rivaldo or Ronaldinho to knock into the net
at one moment, and in the next instant he can be making a saving
tackle back in his own penalty area.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil may boast of its "Triple R" offense, but it really should
be the "Quadruple R," considering Roberto Carlos' contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's his ability to deliver the perfect ball, striking a
hard, low liner across the face of the opposing net to create havoc
amid the tangle of legs reaching out to deflect it, or floating a
delicate cross directly onto the forehead or foot of a striker.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the soccer world watched in awe as Roberto
Carlos did exactly that for Real Madrid, delivering the perfect ball
for Zinedine Zidane to volley into the back of Bayer Leverkusen's net
and put the Spanish club on the way to its ninth European Champions
Cup title.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane got the credit for the superb goal, but it was created by
Roberto Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   Germany will be well aware of the threat he poses. Coach Rudi
Voeller's starting lineup features three Leverkusen players, a number
that would have been four had playmaker Michael Ballack not been
suspended.</TE>
<TE>   A third way Roberto Carlos can undo all of Voeller's work in
building a near-impenetrable German defense that has given up only
one goal in six World Cup games is with a free kick.</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old has perhaps the most wicked left-footed shot in
the world from a dead ball situation.</TE>
<TE>   His most memorable goal was the one he struck against France at
the Tournoi de France in 1997, when he hit the ball with such force
and such spin that it sent photographers behind the net diving to get
out of the way, only to curve back in and beat goalkeeper Fabian
Barthez.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Carlos had another memorable goal at this World Cup. Not
as improbable as the former, it nevertheless was hit with such power
and accuracy that China's defensive wall and goalkeeper could only
stand and watch as the ball screamed past them into the net.</TE>
<TE>   So the trick for Germany on Sunday will be to keep an eye on the
four R's, while still trying to contain Cafu coming down the right
flank and, possibly, Juninho Paulista coming up the middle. It will
be an immense task, and Voeller will probably tell defensive
midfielder Dietmar Hamann and Jens Jeremies, Ballack's replacement,
to stay back and help the defenders rather than involve themselves in
the offense.</TE>
<TE>   All of which means that the Germans' attack probably will be
limited to two options: seeking corner kicks and free kicks, from
which they will hope to get the headers that can test Brazilian
goalkeeper Marcos, and long balls sent in from the wings by Christian
Ziege on the left and Bernd Schneider on the right.</TE>
<TE>   But with a team as explosive as Brazil is on the counterattack,
Germany cannot afford to get caught with too many players forward,
which means forward Oliver Neuville and Miroslav Klose may be in for
a long night battling for crosses against superior numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari knows that his own defense
can't match Germany's and that if Roberto Carlos has one fault, it's
a tendency to go forward too far, too often, leaving the defense more
porous than ever.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the defense-minded Kleberson is a more likely starter
in midfield than Juninho Paulista. Nevertheless, Scolari is expected
to have his team running at Germany from the opening whistle, keeping
it pinned back on defense and unable to use its superior height and
physical strength on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, seeking its fourth World Cup, does not have the speed to
match Brazil's, but it is a disciplined team that seldom loses its
shape. That will be essential if the surprise-minded South Americans
are to be contained.</TE>
<TE>   What Germany does have is a goalkeeper at the very top of his
game. Ronaldinho is unlikely to catch Oliver Kahn as poorly
positioned as England's David Seaman was on that long-range free kick
in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Nor will Kahn allow the defenders in front of him to stand and
watch as Ronaldo waltzes past two, three or four players, as he did
against Turkey in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   And Kahn will eat up any high ball sent his way from the flanks or
from free kicks, so Brazil has to keep it on the ground and have its
forwards dodge the heavy tackles that will be aimed at their ankles
and calves.</TE>
<TE>   Collina, the referee, will need to be especially alert to keep the
game from turning ugly if a German boot catches a Brazilian shin a
little too hard or a little too late. Or if a Brazilian elbow catches
a German chin a little too obviously.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to an intriguing tactical battle: South American
flair against European power. One goal will decide it all, but
whether it will be 1-0 or 4-3 is impossible to tell.</TE>
<TE>   The fans at Yokohama's International Stadium will be hoping that
the first World Cup meeting of the two soccer giants produces a
classic.</TE>
<TE>   But it could all come down to one inspired bit of play by Roberto
Carlos. Watch out for the bald guy.</TE>

<LD>Just before the World Cup champion is crowned Sunday, two tiny
nations will play in a Himalayan kingdom for a different title: the
world's worst team.</LD>
<LD>   Bhutan and Montserrat will meet to determine who ends up at the
bottom of the world rankings, only hours before Brazil and Germany
play in Yokohama, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as "The Other Final," the Bhutan-Montserrat match at
Thimphu, Bhutan, is no small affair to its competitors.</LD>
<TE>   "We are doing this because we are part of the global football
family. We're happy to play Montserrat," says Khare Basnet, the
Bhutan Football Federation's general secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutan, one of the most unspoiled Himalayan areas, came out of
isolation in 2000 to become the youngest member of FIFA, which ranks
the team No. 202, just ahead of last-place Montserrat, a Carribean
nation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland's Urs Linsi was appointed as acting general secretary
of FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   Linsi, FIFA's finance director and deputy general secretary, will
replace Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who agreed to quit after FIFA general
secretary Joseph "Sepp" Blatter won reelection to a four-year term in
May. A permanent replacement will be named later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's top aides, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, added his voice to the growing calls for Russia's
national team to seek a foreign coach after its disappointing World
Cup performance.</TE>
<TE>   Russia was knocked out in the first round and Coach Oleg Romantsev
and assistant Mikhail Gershkovich reportedly offered their
resignations.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to stop walking around in one circle, it is necessary to
consider public opinion and find a coach from abroad," Yastrzhembsky
said, according the news agency Interfax.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Zbigniew Boniek, thought by many to be the best Polish soccer
player ever, is mulling a proposal to coach Poland's national team,
according to a published interview.</TE>
<TE>   Boniek told Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza that Polish Soccer Assn.
President Michal Listkiewicz told him "he would listen to other
candidates but he really wants me to take care of our team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four countries are in the running to stage the 2003 Confederations
Cup and a winner will be picked on Sept. 23, Blatter said.</TE>
<TE>   The contenders are Australia, France, South Africa and the United
States. The competition will be held June 18-29.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Ride Posada to Subway Series Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Catcher has two homers and five RBIs, and
Hernandez returns to close out 11-5 win over the Mets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Mets won the home-run derby. Catcher Jorge Posada and
the New York Yankees won the game.</LD>
<LD>   Posada connected from both sides of the plate to drive in five
runs and Robin Ventura knocked in four against his former team as the
Yankees defeated the Mets, 11-5, Friday night at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Yet for all the big hits, Orlando Hernandez provided the biggest
lift for the Yankees. Fresh off the disabled list from a bad back, he
came in with an 8-5 lead and pitched four scoreless innings for his
first career save.</LD>
<TE>   "El Duque restored order," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who will soon rejoin the rotation, seemed enthused
about his outing. He kept the ball from his save and did a rare
interview in English.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the question," he said. "I feel good. I feel fine. I'm
very happy to come back to the team. It was a good night."</TE>
<TE>   As lightning crackled beyond the center-field fence and a sellout
crowd of 55,739 chanted, the city rivals combined for five homers in
the first five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn hit one--off the Canon copier sign--and Roger Cedeno and
Timo Perez also connected for the Mets. But those homers produced
only four runs, and Posada bettered that.</TE>
<TE>   Posada had been in a six-for-39 rut before breaking loose.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura hit a two-run double and had two sacrifice flies. He has
19 homers and 57 runs batted in after having only 21 home runs and 61
RBIs for the Mets all of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez retired his first seven batters he faced before Mike
Piazza reached. With one out in the eighth, the Met star hit a soft
liner to first baseman Nick Johnson, who let the ball bounce and then
mishandled it for an error. Piazza knocked left knees with Johnson as
he crossed the bag, then tumbled, while Johnson stayed on his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza stayed in the game--he and Johnson were a bit sore
later--and there were no problems.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Munitions Depot Explosion Leaves 19 Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPIN BULDAK, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Rockets, bullets and flaming munitions ripped through this dusty
Afghan border town Friday after a large ammunition dump blew up,
killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens of others. The local
Afghan commander blamed a rocket attack for triggering the blast.</LD>
<LD>   Fazaludin Agha, the local commander in Spin Buldak, 300 miles
southwest of Kabul, the capital, said it was not known who fired the
rocket that he said set off the initial explosion at the ammunition
dump late Thursday. Secondary explosions continued into the early
hours Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The commander said the victims included women, children and Afghan
soldiers. At least seven soldiers who had been guarding the munitions
cache were missing.</LD>
<TE>   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Lapan said no U.S. military
forces were involved or in the area when the explosions occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons storehouse was used by the Taliban and was taken over
by the U.S.-allied Afghan forces that ousted the Islamic regime.
Afghan officials said they had planned to move the depot away from
the residential area.</TE>
<TE>   After the explosions subsided, rocket-propelled grenades,
antiaircraft rounds and small-arms munitions lay strewn over a wide
area of the town. Men with Kalashnikov rifles guarded the site.</TE>
<TE>   "A mortar fell on my house," said Abdul Ghaffar, a teenage soldier
who stood guard outside the compound Friday. "It killed my mother and
my brother."</TE>
<TE>   The most seriously wounded were taken to hospitals in Chaman,
about three miles away on the Pakistani side of the border, and to
the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   Children and other people had earlier entered the compound looking
for scrap metal they could sell.</TE>
<TE>   The explosions blasted a local government customs house where food
aid was stored. A nearby mosque and an office of the United Nations
high commissioner for refugees also were damaged.</TE>

<DL>SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia</DL>
<LD>News of his impending execution came to Mayor Nestor Leon Ramirez on
a white sheet of paper.</LD>
<LD>   A guerrilla commander handed the note to a farmer, who delivered
it to Ramirez. It read: "For the good of your health, you must leave
the city. If you do not, you will become a military target."</LD>
<LD>   But Ramirez, leader of this bustling town, decided to ignore the
message, which arrived this month.</LD>
<TE>   Now, death shadows him like a dark halo. He sits at his desk and
wonders: When will they come? And how?</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I am able to work," Ramirez said. "I can't say what will
happen tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Since the collapse of peace talks in February, democracy itself
has become the primary target in Colombia's 38-year-old guerrilla
war. Attacks on the symbols of state are part of a new guerrilla
strategy designed to plunge vast swaths of the country into anarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Every mayor in the country--more than 1,000--has been ordered to
resign by the rebels or face death. Scores have quit. Some have fled
to govern from fortified army bases. One of Ramirez's colleagues was
killed in a nearby town this month.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas have also destroyed roads and bridges, crippling
public transport. They have attacked power, telephone and television
towers, halting media and communication transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel attacks have served to showcase one of the most
fundamental problems in this nation's increasingly barbaric war. More
than 180 years after Colombia's founding, the government has yet to
impose control over its sprawling territory.</TE>
<TE>   It is Colombia's lawlessness that has allowed the guerrilla war to
fester for four decades. It also fostered the explosion of the drug
crops here that now provide most of the cocaine and much of the
heroin available on U.S. streets.</TE>
<TE>   Before the collapse of peace talks, the rebels had maintained an
uneasy coexistence with local officials in areas they dominated. Now,
they have decided to wage a campaign to prove the state's impotence,
embarrassing the government in a bid to force a return to
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's guerrilla war pits the army and growing right-wing
paramilitary forces against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, and a second, smaller rebel army.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the beginning of a new phase," FARC organizer Juan Pablo
said as he relaxed at a restaurant in a riverside town a few miles
from San Vicente del Caguan, in the heart of the former rebel zone.
"We're going to demonstrate that we're in the position to control
certain areas and that we can push that control to an extreme."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is especially serious in Colombia's southern plains,
where the guerrillas have long held sway. A weeklong tour found a
region abandoned and chaotic. City councils have resigned en masse.
Dozens of towns now lack judges, prosecutors or local police
officials. Commerce has been strangled.</TE>
<TE>   National government officials resist the idea that the guerrillas
are successfully ridding the area of civilian control. But interviews
throughout the region--which never had a strong government
presence--indicated that it has descended into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   What little order exists is imposed by the heavy military and
police presences in urban centers. Beyond is a no man's land where
leftist rebels run tollbooths, patrol destroyed roads and impose
their own brand of law.</TE>
<TE>   The problem has become so serious that U.S. aid officials are
considering suspending development programs in the region designed to
wean locals from drug crop profits by building new infrastructure
like roads, wells and dams.</TE>
<TE>   Such a suspension, in turn, would imperil U.S. efforts to halve
the amount of cocaine produced here by 2005--one of the chief goals
of the $1.3-billion Plan Colombia, launched two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The cinder-block Town Hall in Puerto Rico is mostly empty these
days.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor is gone. He quit this month, reading his resignation
aloud in the town square after receiving a death threat. The City
Council fled too. There are no judges or prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The bridges around town have been blown up. The power substation
lies in rubble. The phone exchange is damaged. The roads are under
the control of guerrillas. There has been no electricity, water or
phone service for months. There isn't even a town ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   In short, there is little to indicate that this woeful town in the
heart of southern Colombia has any connection to the rest of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "We are completely alone," said the police inspector, one of the
few town officials left.</TE>
<TE>   Towns such as Puerto Rico in these sparsely populated plains have
long been under the influence of the FARC, a guerrilla army of 17,000
mostly poor rural peasants who are nominally Marxist.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas' de facto domination of the region was recognized
in 1998 when the Colombian government ceded a big chunk of the
country to the rebels for peace talks. The demilitarized zone was to
be the catalyst for a new and brighter future.</TE>
<TE>   All that changed when the talks collapsed and President Andres
Pastrana ordered the army to retake the zone, about four times the
size of Los Angeles County. The guerrillas went on a rampage of
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The suffering grew worse after elections in May, when Colombians
selected Alvaro Uribe as their next president. Uribe, who is
scheduled to take office in August, won largely as a result of
promises to get tough with the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   To the guerrillas' chagrin, most of the towns in the region voted
for Uribe--a very public reminder of their lack of popular support.
Polls have shown that only 1% to 2% of Colombians back the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas responded by demanding the removal of mayors in
three departments in Colombia's south--Caqueta, Putumayo and Huila.
The demands later spread to Arauca, Norte de Santander and Santander
in the nation's northeast, as well as elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The common thread: The departments are located in areas rich in
the coca and poppy crops that produce cocaine and heroin,
respectively. Roughly half the FARC's $300-million to $500-million
annual income is believed to come from drug profits.</TE>
<TE>   These are also areas where the FARC has a strategic advantage.
Sparsely populated southern Colombia is militarily costly to control
and has little legitimate economic value to the nation. The opposite
is true for the rebels, who can exercise their power with scattered
attacks and benefit from the illicit resources.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas' devotion to clearing the region by violence was
underscored by one rebel squad leader. Standing alongside a
barbed-wire fence on a road leading out of San Vicente, he patted the
black-metal barrel of his AK-47.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we have," he said, "we got through this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The result of the stepped-up attacks has been misery for hundreds
of thousands of Colombians.</TE>
<TE>   In most towns, electricity comes only from portable generators
droning outside stores and restaurants. Phone service is nonexistent.
In San Vicente del Caguan, tens of thousands of residents try to make
calls through 27 existing satellite phone connections.</TE>
<TE>   Repeater towers needed to broadcast television and radio signals
also have been destroyed. The only sources of media are local radio
stations and places lucky enough to have satellite television
service.</TE>
<TE>   More serious problems involve attacks against health and public
transport. The rebels have seized two ambulances from local
communities in the last few months. In the case of Puerto Rico, a
prematurely born baby died after his mother was forced to get out of
the ambulance and hitch a ride to the nearest hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to destroy the institutions of the country and
widen their zone of control," said Omar Varon, mayor of Doncello, a
community near San Vicente. "It's an attack against the state ...
[and] civil society is paying for it."</TE>
<TE>   Guerrillas dismissed the claim. Juan Pablo, who organizes
clandestine guerrilla fronts that operate in cities, called the
misery "suffering light." He noted that the rebels could easily cut
food and fuel supplies but have not, instead only making such
deliveries more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to break the normal rhythm of the economy," Juan
Pablo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas have become increasingly brutal during military
confrontations. Last month, nine soldiers on leave were stopped at a
rebel roadblock outside San Vicente del Caguan. Their mutilated
bodies were found days later.</TE>
<TE>   Army Col. Cesar Delacruz said some of the men's genitals were cut
off. Others among those killed were found without fingernails. The
account could not be independently confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "They have lost all respect for life," said Delacruz, commander of
the local battalion in San Vicente del Caguan, where the men were
stationed.Military officials have responded to the rebel offensive by
successfully taking control of most local cities and towns.</TE>
<TE>   Streets and cafes throughout the former rebel zone are now filled
with soldiers and police. A gunfight outside a hotel one recent night
was quickly quelled by a squad of soldiers firing their rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the urban centers, however, control is nearly nonexistent.
A squad of guerrillas eating lunch under a tree near the town of La
Sombra smiled when asked about recent battles with the army.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we fight anyone when the army doesn't ever come by?" the
squad leader asked.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian army officials acknowledged that small squads of
guerrillas still roam the zone. But they portrayed the rebels as the
last remnants of a mostly vanquished force.</TE>
<TE>   There are skirmishes on an almost daily basis, the officials said.
U.S. trained counter-narcotic brigades have played a significant
role, because many of the guerrilla fronts in southern Colombia are
linked to the drug trade.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the U.S. has given "technical intelligence" support
to the effort to retake the zone, Delacruz said. He did not explain
further, but after peace talks collapsed, the U.S. lifted
restrictions that limited intelligence sharing to narcotics
operations. It began providing rebel target coordinates to the
Colombian military.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that the army's offensive has had an effect: The
guerrillas seem hard up for cash. They held an auction last month to
sell off stolen cars. And they have begun rustling cattle, according
to a local rancher.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the army has managed to block any large-scale invasion by
right-wing paramilitary forces. Many had predicted that the zone
would become a bloody battleground between rebels and paramilitary
groups after three years of guerrilla domination.</TE>
<TE>   The national government has responded to the threats against
civilian authority by refusing to recognize the mayors' resignations.
Instead, Interior Minister Armando Estrada Villa offered to step up
protection, with bodyguards and bulletproof cars.</TE>
<TE>   That has done little to appease local officials, however. In
Doncello, one City Council member rejected the government offers and
said he had already prepared his resignation slip.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, one of the councilman's colleagues was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "This life," he said, "is a living death."</TE>

<LD>The Israeli army distributed a photograph of a wide-eyed Palestinian
baby dressed like a suicide bomber--complete with a Hamas headband
and what appeared to be an explosives belt--stirring anger Friday
among Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   The authenticity of the picture, which appeared on the front pages
of several newspapers, could not be verified. But the image incensed
Israelis, who have been targeted in 71 suicide bombings that have
killed more than 250 Israelis in the last 21 months.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Miri Eisin, a senior army intelligence analyst, said the
picture of the baby, who appeared to be 12 to 18 months old, was
found Tuesday in the family album of a senior Hamas militant.</LD>
<TE>   Dore Gold, an advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, said
the picture "symbolizes the incitement and hatred which the
Palestinian leadership has been using to brainwash an entire
generation of Palestinian children."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Labor Minister Ghassan Khatib, while stating
opposition to suicide bombings, said they are an "unfortunate but
inevitable" result of Israeli occupation.</TE>

<HD>Reports Fault U.S. Pilots in Deaths of Canadian Soldiers</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Separate probes conclude that Americans
violated procedures in the 'friendly fire' incident that killed four.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. and Canadian investigations into a "friendly fire" bombing in
Afghanistan that killed four Canadian soldiers in April both found
that two F-16 pilots violated procedures and one overrode an order to
hold his fire, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A summary of the Canadian report, released Friday, said that
muzzle flashes from an approved training mission by the soldiers were
so far below the U.S. pilots that they posed "no threat" to the
planes, which had been ordered not to fire.</LD>
<LD>   A classified 1,500-page report by the United States, which was
described but not released Friday, concluded that the pilots
exercised "inappropriate use of lethal force," said Marine Lt. Gen.
Michael DeLong, deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Fla.</LD>
<TE>   The bombing was the deadliest incident involving Canadian troops
in a combat zone since the Korean War and strained U.S. relations
with one of its closest allies. Some U.S. officials believe that it
contributed to the Canadian Defense Ministry's announcement that it
would pull its soldiers out of Afghanistan next month, a decision
officially attributed to Canadian forces being stretched too thin.</TE>
<TE>   The reports found that the two F-16 pilots were flying over Tarnak
Farms, a former Al Qaeda training site south of the city of Kandahar
that the U.S. military turned into an approved live-fire training
ground, about 2 a.m. on April 18 when the lead pilot saw what he
described as fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot, who was returning to Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait after
a long patrol over Afghanistan, was given permission from a nearby
Air Warning and Control System, or AWACS, surveillance plane to
target the flash site, but not to fire. As he "locked on," the second
pilot--his wingman--saw more flashes that he thought were
surface-to-air missiles and asked for permission to fire his
20-millimeter cannon. The AWACS commander told him to hold fire and
asked for more information.</TE>
<TE>   The wingman gave the information but then immediately said he was
responding to the perceived threat "in self-defense," as fighter
pilots are allowed to do, a summary of the U.S. report said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot plunged to 10,000 feet and dropped a 500-pound
laser-guided bomb that killed the four Canadians and injured eight.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian soldiers, from the 3rd Battalion of the Princess
Patricia's Light Infantry Brigade, were firing a range of weapons,
from pistols to shoulder-fired antitank guns, but not surface-to-air
weapons, defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians took all necessary precautions, according to the
reports. They had sought approval for the night-firing training at a
designated training site routinely used by coalition soldiers and
even stationed a Canadian sentry in the air control tower at the U.S.
base in Kandahar, the Canadian report said. Both reports cleared the
Canadians of any blame.</TE>
<TE>   The next step could be disciplinary action. The Canadian report
recommends that both pilots face a hearing to decide whether criminal
charges should be filed. The U.S. document recommends a range of
potential disciplinary actions, though defense officials declined to
say what they were.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Tommy Franks, who as commander of the U.S. Central Command is
directing the war, passed the U.S. report on to Air Force officials
to consider any actions against the pilots.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has no say in punishing the pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing we can do to bring our lost soldiers back, but
we will do all that is humanly possible to mitigate the risk of such
a tragedy happening again," said John McCallum, Canada's defense
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials declined to name the pilots, but they have been
identified in news reports as wingman Maj. Harry Schmidt and lead
pilot Maj. William Umbach, both of the Illinois Air National Guard's
170th Fighter Squadron. The incident is particularly embarrassing to
the Pentagon because Schmidt is a former instructor at the Navy's
elite Top Gun fighter school.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt's attorney, Capt. James Key, has complained that a "gag
order" has prevented him from talking to about 70 witnesses who have
been interviewed in the investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials left open the possibility that other officers
might be punished. U.S. investigators found that "failings within the
pilots' immediate command structures, while not causing the
incidents, were contributing factors," DeLong said.</TE>

<LD>Two helicopters rescued 48 more people from a ship trapped in ice
near Antarctica, but rescue officials feared that a coming storm
could delay efforts to evacuate 38 people still stranded on board.</LD>
<LD>   The copters arrived aboard the South African ship Agulhas, which
left Cape Town on June 16 to rescue the 79 Russian scientists and 28
crew members aboard the German-owned Magdalena Oldendorff, which has
been stuck for more than two weeks in temperatures as low as minus
20.</LD>
<LD>   The helicopters took 21 people back to the Agulhas on Thursday.</LD>

<HD>Israel Blasts Hebron Complex</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Up to 15 Palestinians in a West Bank security
building are apparently killed. Army says they were responsible for
terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HEBRON, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Moving swiftly to resolve a four-day siege, the Israeli army blew up
a Palestinian security headquarters, apparently killing as many as 15
militants who had barricaded themselves inside.</LD>
<LD>   About 11 p.m. Friday, the army set off a tremendous explosion that
shattered windows around this West Bank city, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   "This was huge. I would guess that anybody inside is dead," said
Dan Fortson, an American who watched the explosion from about 200
yards away. He said that the building disappeared behind a cloud of
smoke and that when the smoke cleared the building appeared to be
heavily damaged.</LD>
<TE>   Early today, witnesses reported a second blast that reduced the
building to rubble. "There's nothing called the headquarters
anymore," said Mohammed Maswadeh, whose windows were blown out.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Israeli army said that those inside the
building were responsible for "murderous terror attacks" inside
Israel. After encouraging the suspects to surrender, the army said,
it "detonated in a controlled manner part of the building" with the
first explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The army was apparently trying to avoid the kind of prolonged
standoff that took place in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, where
militants holed up for five weeks in April and May. But this building
had no particular religious or historical significance, allowing the
army to take more extreme measures.</TE>
<TE>   Because the explosion occurred during the Sabbath, senior Israeli
officials were not available for comment. But the army said it had
found evidence in Hebron that the Palestinian security
services--which report through the chain of command to Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat--were sponsoring terrorism. Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government has been eager to produce
proof of Arafat's links to terrorists; evidence supplied by Israel
prompted President Bush this week to call on the Palestinian people
to change their leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Friday that the U.S. would
turn to other Palestinian leaders to broker peace with Israel and to
reform the Palestinian movement, but he did not specify who.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's words followed several days of uncertainty about whether
the United States would again deal with Arafat, and he cited the
administration view that Arafat did not respond strongly enough to
U.S. pleas to rein in the violence against Israel and promote peace.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a price to be paid for inaction against terrorism,
inaction against reform," Powell told Associated Press. "There are
others in the Palestinian movement that can help transform it."</TE>
<TE>   In its statement about the Hebron action, the army said,
"Palestinian terrorists took refuge in this building with the
knowledge of the senior Palestinian leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the army said, it found more than 100 explosive devices
similar to those used by Hezbollah, the Islamic movement that targets
Israel from Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it thought there were about 15 people inside at the
time of the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli radio reported that most were members of the Tanzim, a
militia associated with Arafat's Fatah faction, including a member of
the Islamic movement Hamas who had gunned down two Jewish settlers
and a soldier this month in the nearby settlement of Karmei Tzur.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Israel negotiated the surrender of more than
100 Palestinians working inside the building, including 20 who
officials said were wanted militants. In a last-ditch effort to flush
out those remaining inside, a former Palestinian Cabinet minister was
sent in Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a microphone and I was calling, 'If you are here, please
talk to me,' but nobody answered," Talal Seder said in an interview.
He said he could not say whether the large building was empty or
whether the people inside simply did not want to come out.</TE>
<TE>   Since Tuesday, the army had been pounding away at the building
with tanks, helicopter gunships and bulldozers.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been terrifying for us," said Fouwas Aweiwi, 31, who
lives about 100 yards away with his pregnant wife and two young sons.
"The children are shaking. They can't sleep. Everybody is afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Israel has conducted a sweeping operation throughout the West Bank
in the aftermath of two suicide bombings last week in Jerusalem that
left 26 Israelis dead.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments Friday, Hamas leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin led
an anti-American demonstration in Gaza City, apparently disproving
claims this week that the Palestinian Authority had put him under
house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, it was reported that an Israeli military court
sentenced a 16-year-old Palestinian member of Hamas to life in prison
Thursday for trying to blow himself up in February, the first time a
would-be bomber was brought to trial.</TE>

<HD>Koreans Battle in Yellow Sea</HD>
<DH>Asia: Four Southern sailors die in clash with the North.
Seoul says the Communists fired first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>South Korea said four of its sailors were killed, 22 injured and one
missing this morning after a North Korean naval vessel opened fire on
two South Korean patrol boats in the Yellow Sea.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean military officials said two of the South's vessels
were warning two North Korean military vessels that had crossed the
maritime border, known as the Northern Limit Line, when they were
fired upon unexpectedly by high-caliber guns about 10:30 a.m. The
South Koreans returned fire.</LD>
<LD>   The four South Korean men killed were on the deck of one boat,
which later sank. Lt. Gen. Lee Sang Hee with South Korea's Ministry
of Defense said it's believed that the 122-foot-long vessel was hit
with an 85-millimeter gun.</LD>
<TE>   The number of casualties on the North Korean side was not
immediately known, although the North's 136-foot vessels are each
capable of carrying up to 50 people. Television footage showed both a
North Korean and a South Korean vessel with black smoke trailing
behind being towed by South Korean vessels.</TE>
<TE>   The North Korean vessels were said to be accompanying a fleet of
up to 30 fishing boats, although according to one report only the two
naval vessels had crossed into South Korean territory. One was
reportedly about three miles south of the maritime border, the other
1.8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The area where the deadly face-off occurred, near Yonpyong Island,
has witnessed several past confrontations around this time of year,
when crab is plentiful. "We heard gunshots but thought it was just
routine training," Yonpyong villager Park Gun Sok told local
reporters. North Korea has refused to recognize the maritime line of
separation and had no immediate comment on today's conflict.</TE>
<TE>   As with all North Korean incursions, a key question is whether
this one was intentional and, if so, what the motivation was. "The
fact is, we were fired upon first by North Korea and we suffered
casualties," said the Defense Ministry's Lee at a hastily called news
conference. "So we believe it was a calculated attempt."</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean vessel that took the direct hit was believed to
be within 500 yards of the North Korean vessel when it was attacked.
It sank a short time later. South Korean officials said they believed
that 30 or more North Koreans sailors may have been killed when the
South Koreans returned fire.</TE>
<TE>   President Kim Dae Jung called a National Security Council meeting
for this afternoon. He urged its members to act on principle, not
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   The last major incursion happened in the same area in June 1999,
also during crab season, when an estimated 30 North Korean sailors
died and seven South Koreans were injured in an exchange of gunfire.
The conflict also damaged two South Korean vessels and seven North
Korean craft.</TE>
<TE>   The latest incident will put pressure on Kim's government to mount
a political, and perhaps even some sort of military, response. It
could also further discredit Kim's long-standing belief that North
Korea can be changed through gentle persuasion and could set back
recent efforts at rapprochement.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, Seoul-based representative with the Asia Foundation,
said the Kim government will probably downplay the incident, argue
that it underscores the need for dialogue and urge Washington to go
ahead with a proposed high-level meeting between U.S. and North
Korean representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. side's response will be more complicated, however," he
added. The Bush administration has said all along that any
improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations is premised on better
North-South relations, and this clearly does little to engender trust
on the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   There are 37,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Ki Tak, a professor of international relations and critic of
the Kim administration, said there's little doubt that this incident,
which lasted about 20 minutes, was intentional. North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il is threatened by the recent glory afforded to South Korea
through the World Cup, Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang chose this spot for a confrontation because it's one of
the few areas where there is no U.S. military presence, Lee said, and
the power balance is more even.</TE>
<TE>   "The [South Korean] government must be confused," he said.
"They've spent the past four years flattering North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Today's clash follows several border incursions by North Korean
navy ships into South Korean waters in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The maritime border, which is not clearly marked, was violated a
dozen times last year, South Korea claims. The two Koreas were
divided in 1945 and never signed a peace agreement after the 1950-53
Korean War.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Government Will Attempt to Rein In Militant
Religious Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAWALPINDI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf's military government is expected to
implement a law within the next few days to regulate the country's
controversial Islamic religious schools, whose increasingly militant,
anti-Western teachings have influenced a generation of young men.</LD>
<LD>   But the law has already met such strong resistance from religious
leaders that effective enforcement remains far from certain.</LD>
<LD>   "Enforcement is the million-dollar question," said Religious
Affairs Minister Mahmood Ghazi.</LD>
<TE>   The ordinance, approved in principle last week by Musharraf's
Cabinet after months of preparation, requires each of the estimated
8,000 to 10,000 Muslim schools in the country--known as madrasas--to
register within six months with federal and provincial authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Registration is viewed as a first step toward curtailing the
teaching of what has become an increasingly extreme brand of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to ordering punishments of up to two years in prison
for Muslim clerics who use the madrasas to preach militancy and
sectarian hatred, the ordinance requires the schools to broaden their
curricula to include math, general science, English and social
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 1.5 million students will be affected, Ghazi said.</TE>
<TE>   The law is the latest in a series of measures taken by Musharraf
to weaken the influence of religious extremists in the country. Many
in the West--and in Musharraf's government--came to see the madrasas
as incubators of the virulent anti-Americanism and strong sympathies
for Muslim militancy that were visible in Pakistan during the days
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But many madrasa administrators and teachers view the reform
efforts with suspicion. They insist that the problems are exaggerated
by what they characterize as outside interests working to undercut
Muslims. Musharraf's government, they say, has simply buckled under
to Western influence.</TE>
<TE>   "You only reform what is bad, and madrasas are not bad," said
Shafiq Julludhari, head of the Jamia Muhammadi Madrasa in this
bustling city in Punjab province. Like many of the madrasa leaders in
Pakistan, Julludhari is a follower of the conservative Deoband school
of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more violence in the [state] educational institutions
and universities than in madrasas," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the ordinance, foreign donations to the madrasas
will require government approval and foreigners studying in them will
need to register with the government and possess student visas.</TE>
<TE>   Madrasas are as old as Islam itself, but their number has grown
rapidly in Pakistan over the last two decades, spurred by the
religious fervor connected with resistance to the Soviet Union's
invasion of neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the United States encouraged this fervor as a way to
weaken its Cold War enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Arab world money, much of it from arch-fundamentalist donor
groups, also flowed in and helped harden--and narrow--the message
conveyed in the madrasas. In many, the curriculum was gradually
reduced to memorizing the Koran in its original Arabic, a language
that few Pakistani students understand, and then putting extreme
interpretations on the words.</TE>
<TE>   Because the madrasas are boarding schools that offer not just free
education but also free room and board, they are often the only
schooling option for boys from poor families.</TE>
<TE>   Largely isolated from the world, students are in effect shut off
from all but the hard-line brand of Islam that the resident clerics
frequently season with anti-Americanism and tales of Western
decadence.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the archconservative Taliban, who were themselves
products of Pakistan's madrasas, quickly became role models for these
young and impressionable students after they came to power in
Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than imposing the new controls on the schools' leaders,
Ghazi said, he is trying to sell them on the idea as a way to improve
the quality of education offered.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some elements of persuasion," he said, "and some elements
of coercion.</TE>
<TE>   "The transformation must be gradual," he added. "We're trying to
introduce new books and new teachers for the secular syllabus."</TE>
<TE>   But with Pakistan's state-run educational system woefully
underfinanced and staffed by low-paid teachers who frequently show
little motivation, simply finding good people for the madrasas won't
be easy. Ghazi said the government hopes to hire state-school
teachers for part-time work.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, those now teaching in the madrasas will be paid
"token amounts" to undergo retraining at several of the country's
teaching colleges.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Ghazi said, the clerics have agreed to introduce the basic
secular subjects as mandatory through the 10th grade. He said that
three model madrasas will be established under federal control and
that four administered by the North-West Frontier provincial
government have begun operating.</TE>
<TE>   But as Ghazi noted, enforcing the provisions against incitement
won't be easy, even if clerics are won over.</TE>
<TE>   As interviews with religious leaders make clear, even defining
what constitutes extremist teachings is highly debatable. For
example, Mohammed Kamal, the head of the Rawalpindi branch of the
Jamaat-i-Islami religious party, said that teaching contempt for the
U.S. isn't extremist. It is an obligation, deduced by simple logic.</TE>
<TE>   "When [our teachers] see Americans supporting those who kill
Muslims around the world--in Palestine, in India--they develop a
hatred," he said. "So they teach students that Americans are against
their religion and so they should fight against them."</TE>

<HD>U.S., Mexico Reach Deal to End Water Dispute</HD>
<DH>Resources: The Latin nation agrees to pay back a token
amount in return for a pledge of replenishment if it doesn't rain by
Oct. 26.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico agreed Friday to an immediate but token payment on its vast
water debt to the United States, ending for now an unusually bitter
quarrel over how to manage the Rio Grande Valley's worst drought in
nearly half a century.</LD>
<LD>   In return for a 29-billion-gallon payment to parched South Texas
farms, the U.S. pledged to lend back all or part of that volume if
rain fails to replenish by Oct. 26 the dwindling reserves of drinking
water for Mexican border cities. The payment is 6% of the debt.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico will get $45 million from the North American Development
Bank and a U.S. promise to seek additional funding to overhaul
Mexico's leak-prone water delivery systems, according to the deal
hammered out in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The accord is to be made public today in both nations' capitals,
but Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced some details Friday, and
negotiators on both sides confirmed others.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over scarce water soured U.S.-Mexican relations
throughout the spring and eclipsed all other bilateral issues until
the neighbors began quiet negotiations three weeks ago. The accord
marks a truce but leaves neither side fully satisfied and only begins
to confront the causes of the Rio Grande Valley's water woes.</TE>
<TE>   Perry called the agreement "one show of good faith" but added that
Mexico "must now take the next step, which is to commit to a regular
schedule" of further debt payments.</TE>
<TE>   Decades of unchecked industrial and agricultural growth have
swelled the valley's population from 200,000 to 20 million since
World War II, straining water supplies. The decade-old drought has
cost Texas an estimated $175 million in direct crop losses since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has suffered similar losses in its four states along the
Rio Grande border, with farmers in Tamaulipas recording $40 million
in drought damage over the last year. As tributaries and reservoirs
shrink, people on both sides of the border fear that their fields and
towns will dry up and die.</TE>
<TE>   A 1944 treaty obliges Mexico and the U.S. to share the waters of
the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers. Mexico is supposed to turn over
114 billion gallons a year where six Mexican tributaries--Conchos,
Las Vacas, San Diego, San Rodrigo, Escondido and Salado--flow into
the Rio Grande. The water is measured and stored at two shared
reservoirs. During the current drought, Mexico has fallen 480 billion
gallons in arrears--enough to supply the city of Los Angeles for more
than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has argued that it is not legally obliged to start paying
the water debt before a new five-year treaty cycle begins in late
September. If Texans want more water before then, Chihuahua Gov.
Patricio Martinez said this spring, "they should pray for rain."</TE>
<TE>   But with planting underway in April, Perry demanded that
Washington ignore a Mexican request for $100 million in water
management assistance. Until the entire debt is paid, he said, such
aid would "add insult to real economic injury" to Texas farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican border governors sniped back, some claiming their states'
water to be "sovereign." Dozens of U.S. and Mexican farmers, vying
for scarce water and facing ruin, used tractors to block
international truck traffic on both sides of the Rio Grande. U.S.
officials said satellite photos proved that Mexico was hoarding
water; the Mexicans complained of being spied on.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has pressed for water repayment at meetings with
Mexican President Vicente Fox. Mexican diplomats complained that
water was distracting U.S. attention from their nation's priorities,
including a proposal to legalize more than 3 million undocumented
Mexicans in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fox postponed a visit to Texas this week after farmers there vowed
to confront him with protests, and he worked to calm nationalist
passions at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Today both governments and both countries understand that the
problem is a lack of water, that it hasn't rained enough in 10 years
and that nobody is hiding water," Fox told reporters Monday. "This
issue can be overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Under Friday's accord, Mexico will transfer to the United States
ownership rights to 29 billion gallons that are now part of Mexico's
share in their jointly held reservoirs--Amistad and Falcon--along the
Rio Grande. The quantity is a compromise between the 32 billion
gallons demanded by Texas and the 11 billion gallons first offered by
Mexico on June 6.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said the water will flow to Texas within days--as soon as
the U.S. and Mexican representatives to the International Boundary
and Water Commission, which administers the two reservoirs and the
1944 treaty, sign a paper adjusting the two national accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer would reduce Mexico's share of the 346 billion
gallons of water in the two reservoirs to 51 billion gallons. That
level is so low, Mexican officials warn, that 1.5 million Mexicans in
a string of river cities from Piedras Negras to Matamoros might run
out of drinking water if no rain falls by February.</TE>
<TE>   To safeguard those supplies, Mexico sought and won an unusual U.S.
pledge to guarantee a return to the current "minimum comfort level"
of 80 billion gallons in Mexico's share of the reservoirs after Oct.
26, negotiators said. The United States would lend Mexico water to
make up any shortfall, as long as Mexico takes out no more than
"normal" amounts for irrigation and urban use in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing now is to address the problems of the growers
in South Texas," a Mexican official said. "They are planting now, but
they won't need the water in October. So if, by October, the amount
we are about to give is not replenished by rain, the water would come
back."</TE>
<TE>   The accord brought a sigh of relief in both capitals but grumbling
on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "What's so frustrating about this, they could have given us this
water a month ago when it would have helped more," said Jo Jo White,
chief of the Hidalgo and Cameron Counties Irrigation District in
South Texas. He called the Mexican payment "pitifully small" for the
amount of citrus, cotton and grain taking root across the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the crops will be able to get a drink of water, but the
vast, vast majority won't," he added.</TE>
<TE>   In Coahuila, the driest Mexican state in the valley, Gov. Enrique
Martinez said the agreement is "very risky" because it obliges Mexico
to give up water before planned investments enable it to conserve
more.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 40% of the water passing from reservoir to end user
in northern Mexico vanishes into barren soil. The aid outlined in
Friday's reported deal would modernize Mexico's delivery and
irrigation systems to make more efficient use of water and help the
country pay off its debt over the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "This conversion will take three years, but they're taking our
water now," Martinez complained.</TE>
<TE>   The accord will convert $40 million from each country's account in
the binational North American Development Bank into a trust fund for
water conservation works on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico will receive an additional $5 million from the bank for
engineering studies, and the United States will consider additional
contributions of $225 million to the fund by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Specialists in both countries say the conservation effort is a
start but barely addresses the idea that there may be limits to the
valley's growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get to work immediately on a binational drought
management plan that allocates what rain does fall in the next few
months," said Mary Kelly, executive director of the Texas Center for
Policy Studies in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have another dry year coming, everybody is going to have to
cut back, and we need to know what that scenario looks like. We can't
count on a hurricane."</TE>

<HD>Xerox Adds to Scandals With Huge Restatement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drumbeat of corporate misdeeds grew louder Friday when Xerox
Corp. disclosed that it had improperly recorded $6.4 billion in
revenue over a five-year period, far larger than the $3 billion
estimated in April when federal regulators slapped the copier giant
with the largest fine for fraud in corporate history.</LD>
<LD>   The restated financial results, ordered in April as part of
Xerox's $10-million fine to settle fraud charges with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, reduced Xerox's revenue by $1.9 billion from
1997 to 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The restatement centers on the practice of reporting revenue from
equipment-leasing contracts before Xerox actually received payments.</LD>
<TE>   The news follows a string of corporate accounting scandals that
have rapidly engulfed Fortune 500 companies. From Enron Corp. in
December to WorldCom Inc. on Tuesday, each week has brought new
disclosures of financial mismanagement involving billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers have gotten so large that it's akin to auditors
driving past Mt. Everest and saying they never saw it. How can you
miss $6 billion?" said Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accountant and a
professor at Colorado State University.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that corporate America has somehow gotten into the
mind-set that this is OK."</TE>
<TE>   Best known for developing the modern photocopier in 1949, Xerox
has for decades been a technology powerhouse, developing such
pioneering technologies as the computer mouse, laser printing and
computer screen icons.</TE>
<TE>   In the restatement filed Friday with the SEC, Xerox reduced its
revenue by $1.9 billion, or about 2% of sales, to $91 billion from
1997 to 2001. The amount is the difference between the $6.4 billion
improperly booked and the $4.5 billion it actually received. The
company expects to receive the $1.9 billion in future years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Stamford, Conn.-based company slashed its pretax
income over the five-year period by $1.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Xerox today closes a difficult chapter in the company's history,"
Xerox Chief Executive Anne M. Mulcahy said in a statement. Since the
SEC launched its investigation two years ago, Xerox has replaced its
chief executive and chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's announcement "falls under the scope of our original
investigation," which found that Xerox "misled and betrayed"
investors, said Paul Berger, the SEC's associate director of
enforcement. "We found what we considered to be a pattern of
pervasive fraud."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has said it will continue to look into Xerox executives
involved in the scandal along with the company's former auditor of 30
years, KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox fired KPMG in October and retained PricewaterhouseCoopers to
conduct the restatement.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG defended its audit of Xerox, saying Friday's restatement
"defies economic reality."</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to stand behind our audit work," KPMG said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, already shaken by a series of corporate shenanigans,
pushed shares of Xerox down $1.03, or 12.9%, to $6.97 on Friday on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing of the news is bad because of WorldCom and other
surprises, so their stock is taking a big hit," said James Lundy, who
worked for Xerox and is now vice president of Gartner Inc., a market
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very jittery market right now."</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC allegations involve several accounting practices,
the most substantial revolve around two.</TE>
<TE>   The first is the recognition of revenue from multiyear leases on
office equipment. Xerox improperly booked revenue that was not yet
received in order to "burnish and distort operating results," the SEC
said in April.</TE>
<TE>   The second practice involved setting aside "cookie jar" reserves
to cover restructuring costs, and then improperly adding them back in
later to fatten earnings, the SEC alleged.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox neither admitted nor denied the allegations in its
settlement with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the magnitude of Friday's restatement, Xerox probably will
survive financially, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're working hard to get back to solid fundamentals," Lundy
said. "They have a couple of billion in cash. Last week, they just
paid off $2.8 billion in debt. They just renegotiated their loans,
which is inclusive of today's scenario. And they have a $700-million
loan payment due in September. The rest of their loans aren't due
until 2005."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Xerox must find ways to lift sagging sales and
cut costs. The company, which gets two-thirds of its revenue from
black-and-white printers and copiers, plans to sell more color
products to boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   To raise cash and repay its debt, the company plans to sell or
spin off several units, including its pioneering Palo Alto Research
Center. In October, Xerox sold half of its office equipment
manufacturing operations to Flextronics International Ltd. for $220
million.</TE>
<TE>   "More than anything, they have to execute consistently now," Lundy
said. "No more surprises."</TE>

<HD>Laughter, Tears in El Centro</HD>
<DH>Latinos stir debate by proposing to name a street after
adoptive son Paul Rodriguez, who draws humor, and anger, from his
ties there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Paul Rodriguez's lightning wit is paralyzed. He sips a
margarita at Lucy's El Adobe and ponders the quandary he's in.</LD>
<LD>   Not in his most farfetched stand-up routine could he have invented
a tale in which a city would seize on him as a symbol of equality.
Yet in the desert town of El Centro, a group of residents wants to
name a street for him. The idea was meant as a gesture of gratitude
for Rodriguez's years of free shows and donations. Then it became
much more: It turned out that no street in El Centro, which is 80%
Latino, bore a Spanish surname.</LD>
<LD>   Political forces have lined up. The local Spanish-language
newspaper endorses Paul Rodriguez Boulevard. The English-language
paper opposes it. A thousand people have signed petitions supporting
the proposal. ("We don't exist," an organizer complains. "We're the
majority but we don't exist.") The mayor and chamber of commerce are
cool to the idea.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes a seat at the back of a bus is more than just a seat. In
El Centro a street sign is more than just a street sign. And so Paul
Rodriguez, one of America's best-known Latino entertainers, has
become a sort of Rosa Parks of the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why he is torn. He's no hero, he says. He's not Cesar
Chavez. The Play-Doh face scrunches. Shouldn't I be dead for
something like a street? Why me, anyway? I'm just a guy who made
folks there laugh once or twice.</TE>
<TE>   He knows this is a vast oversimplification. For the last four
years, the onetime migrant farm kid and the scrappy rural outpost
have had an ongoing love affair. They are mirror images--of barrios,
of lettuce and alfalfa, of poverty and possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I love El Centro because it's just like me," he says. "El Centro
is a place that nobody ever thought about or had any expectations
for. If I were a city I'd be El Centro."</TE>
<TE>   His first gig there was for the Police Athletic League. He figured
he'd drive the 220 miles, tell a few jokes, collect his paycheck and
leave. But he kept coming back, and with each visit, El Centro dug in
a little deeper, bringing back memories of a childhood in the fields
where his parents had harvested crops before moving to San Pedro,
East L.A., Fresno and Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm crying, and my mother has me on her back," Rodriguez
recalled. "I remember my mother ripping open a beautiful, perfect
head of lettuce and pulling out its heart. I remember her long black
hair and how she sang me a little song and gave me the tender leaves
from the inside of that lettuce. Then she threw the rest away, afraid
to get caught."</TE>
<TE>   Up and down the state his parents picked cotton, tomatoes, lettuce
and oranges to support five girls and two boys. In a good year,
Paul's father, Pablo, made $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   "One day ... I could hear the sound of a plane coming toward us.
My mother grabs me screaming: 'No respires! No respires!' and shoves
me inside her rebozo (a traditional Mexican shawl). I'm struggling
because I couldn't breathe, and I'm so afraid. I'm thinking that my
mother is going to kill me." His voice trembles. "But the planes were
dropping poison--pesticide--on the workers and she was trying to save
me."</TE>
<TE>   When his father died in 1996, an autopsy showed that his aorta had
gradually disintegrated, a legacy of his years in the fields,
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those bastards wouldn't allow migrant farm workers an hour's
warning back then. God only knows how many miscarriages, how many
people were disabled, how many lives, were lost--all brown
lives--because of that. They'd have the audacity to say these
chemicals are harmless. Tell that to my father when his aorta busted.
People say, 'Paul, there's so much anger in your comedy.' Well, it
didn't just come out of thin air."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the man who can pull $100,000 in Las Vegas plays El Centro
for free. Rodriguez tells jokes atop hay trailers to an adoring crowd
in the Police Athletic League youth center parking lot--now paved
with money raised at his local shows. On his dime, the league has
taken kids to Disneyland and to Sacramento to meet their local
legislators, sent a team to a national boxing tournament and built
the 6,000-square-foot multipurpose room called Rodriguez Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The street-renaming effort is a thank-you from the folks in the
league, who are spearheading the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   If Rodriguez appears simultaneously grateful and wary of the
honor, it is because he's already carrying La Raza on his back. True,
he has nobody but himself to blame; it is his own choice to be the
self-appointed standard-bearer for all Latino causes, and to see life
through the eyes of  the maids and the cooks and the carwash
attendants. He rages lovingly against his people's political apathy
and naivete. La Raza is a buried emotional treasure Rodriguez
discovered, but it also weighs him down, and if the street proposal
goes through, El Centro will be on his back as well.</TE>
<TE>   "See, the problem is, I just don't want to ever disappoint
anybody," he says. "Even worse, a whole city!"</TE>
<TE>   This is not just idle fretting. Rodriguez has a talent for
sabotaging himself. Part of the problem is that he simply will not
shut up. Agents and managers flinch, Hollywood recoils; it is
constantly suggested that he'd get much farther if he'd only be a
little more restrained and a little less Mexican.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Rodriguez was the Johnny Carson of Latin
television, hosting a bilingual talk show broadcast in 17 countries.
Then, against all marketing advice, he featured farm labor rights
activist Cesar Chavez. Supermarkets, furious at Chavez's calls for
boycotts, yanked their ads. The show was later canceled.</TE>
<TE>   At a formal White House dinner, Rodriguez recalls, he called
Mexico's then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari a crook. "I can't
understand it. I simply tell the president of Mexico that people are
starving because he's the biggest thief we've ever had, and I'm asked
to leave?"</TE>
<TE>   On a live Spanish-language television-awards show, Rodriguez,
using hand gestures, prophesied that the sheriff's deputies who had
been videotaped beating Mexican immigrants in Riverside would be
sexually assaulted by Mexican convicts once they landed in prison. He
was fired in mid-show.</TE>
<TE>   He broke into comedy commuting by bus from Compton to the Comedy
Store in Hollywood, making $315 a week, often with tasteless ethnic
jokes. He would debut a few years later on the "Tonight Show" with:
"What are the first words a Mexican baby hears? 'Attention Kmart
Shoppers.' " Everyone he loved hated his act; family called from
Mexico, his parents were ashamed. The National Council of La Raza
took him to task.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could take it back, but you know what? We were living in
wretched poverty and I would've done whatever it took."</TE>
<TE>   When he got his first network TV advance for a short-lived series
called "a.k.a. Pablo," he moved his parents out of Compton, buying
his mother the Fresno ranch where she once worked as a maid. His
father lived long enough to see Rodriguez achieve comfortable
celebrity but remained disappointed that his son had not become a
lawyer. "My father died thinking I had wasted a rational mind."</TE>
<TE>   He has three movies in post-production now, but he always returns
to the Laugh Factory, where he and owner Jamie Masada began Monday
"Latino Night" 16 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Monday he takes the stage in jeans, a T-shirt and
baseball cap and tweaks his outrage into humor. The mostly Latino
audience howls with laughter that the city's majority ethnic group
was too pathetic to elect Antonio Villaraigosa mayor. And the black
people in the room crack up at their sense of betrayal over the
rejected reappointment of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks:</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed in my African American friends. They voted for
[L.A. Mayor] Jimmy Hahn," Rodriguez says. "But that's OK, because
then he turned around and [raped] you like a plantation master!"</TE>
<TE>   And what is it with all these Latinos giving their kids Caucasian
names? "Where are all the Juanas? Why are they all Jennifers and
Britneys? What the hell is a Britney? It's like self-hatred."</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs after the show, a reporter wonders why virtually all the
comic's jokes were race-based. Rodriguez uncoils. Because race
determines everything, he says heatedly--who you date, how much money
you make, where you live. Did he ever wish he was white? "I'm ashamed
to say it, but I did. I was 8 years old and I had a crush on a little
redhead and she said, 'My mother says you're a wetback.' I went home
crying to my mother, 'I'm a wetback, this girl I like said so.' "</TE>
<TE>   He became proud to be Latino in 1967. Caught up in a Chicano
street demonstration against police brutality, the 13-year-old
Rodriguez was relishing "brown power" and heaving a rock until his
furious father yanked him into the house. He's less angry today.
Driving a $100,000 Porsche home to a million-dollar house in the San
Fernando Valley will do that, he allows.</TE>
<TE>   He lives alone. Women want a man who is around, he says, and
Rodriguez never has been. "I make the same excuses my father made,"
he shakes his head. "He had to leave to go make a living."</TE>
<TE>   They understand these things in El Centro. Folks who favor naming
a street for Rodriguez rarely mention his films, television shows or
even his performances in town. Instead they talk of his perseverance,
his generosity and humility. People who have barely spoken to him
describe his journey from poverty to celebrity in deeply personal
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the sacrifices, says Felix Meza, the
reporter/photographer/editor/publisher of the local Spanish-language
daily. "The years on the road, the time spent far away from his
family, the loneliness. We know what it takes for someone to get to
where he is so that he's able to come back here and help El Centro,"
Meza says.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell that he's figured some things out about life," says
Martha Martinez, the driving force behind the street-naming effort.
But more than anything, in a place where unemployment is 22% and the
per capita income is barely $14,000 a year, he makes them proud. In
his eyes, they believe, they are not just a poor town with migrant
workers but people with a rich culture and ancient roots. It is a
measure of El Centro's minimal prospects that some insist that a Paul
Rodriguez Boulevard would tell children they too could leave the
fields and be somebody.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez has changed lives, said Eric Scoville, executive
director of the Police Athletic League. "Every time I call Paul he
says, 'Is it for the kids? All right, I'll be leaving in a couple of
hours.' Now he sponsors a soccer team and donates anything I call him
for."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez says he feels as though he is heading home as he drives
past San Diego, through the Kumeyaay Indian reservation to where the
Golden Acorn Casino is the grandest building around, where desolate
bleakness becomes desolate beauty.</TE>
<TE>   El Centro, home to 10,000 families, is placid, but taking a stand
on Paul Rodriguez Boulevard is touchy.</TE>
<TE>   "Like walking through a dairy field," says Mayor Larry Grogan.
"Anywhere you step is bad news."</TE>
<TE>   Grogan has nothing against Rodriguez ("God bless him") but feels
street naming should be a posthumous honor. . Others have suggested
the city's most famous pro athlete, 1940s bantamweight boxing champ
Manuel Ortiz. Opinions do not fall neatly along racial lines. There
are Anglos who support the Rodriguez honor and Latinos who oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   For some Latinos the issue has reopened a painful memory: A few
years ago, the school board turned down a suggestion to name a new
school after Cesar Chavez on the grounds that he was a controversial
figure. But later, when the state opened an employment center on Main
Street, it gave it Chavez's name.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that it won't be easy to win," newspaper editor Meza
says.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Martinez hauls out charts and graphs showing that nearby
Brawley has 14 streets with Latino names; Calexico has 50.</TE>
<TE>   "How do we make them believe we're important?" she says.</TE>
<TE>   El Centro's City Council put off a decision by asking its staff to
develop a street-naming policy. Until then, the Paul Rodriguez
Boulevard movement continues to simmer.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Lucy's El Adobe, the margaritas are finished and Rodriguez
is still protesting ("I'm not anybody to name a street for. I mean,
boulevard.") Owner Lucy Casado stops to rib him about giving her an
autographed picture for her celebrity wall. She's been after him
about it for almost 20 years now.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, Paul, when are you going to give me one?" she pleads.</TE>
<TE>   "When I make it," he answers, half-joking. "When I'm somebody."</TE>

<HD>Half of Military's Anthrax Vaccine Will Be Stockpiled for
Civilian Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>About half of the military's supply of anthrax vaccine will be
stockpiled for civilians in case of a bioterrorism attack, expanding
protection once meant almost exclusively for U.S. troops, the
government said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Vaccination of U.S. troops abroad remains the top priority,
officials said at a joint announcement at the Pentagon by the
departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a domestic need for access to the vaccine," so roughly
half of the millions of doses available will be set aside for
civilians, said William Winkenwerder, Defense Department aide for
health affairs.</LD>
<TE>   The vaccine will not be available for purchase by civilians, who
will get the shots only if they are exposed to the deadly anthrax
bacteria, said William Raub, an HHS deputy director for public health
preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Pentagon program vaccinates soldiers ahead of
time as a precaution against possible exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Exposed citizens--whether police, emergency workers, or
anyone--would get the vaccination along with antibiotics, a regimen
offered to postal workers and others exposed in last fall's still
unsolved anthrax mail attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Those attacks, along with the Sept. 11 hijacked plane attacks on
America, have prompted the new policy to split the drug between
civilian and military communities, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   During the anthrax attacks, the health department received 10,000
doses of vaccine from the Pentagon to start its stockpile. Only 100
people exposed to mailed anthrax received doses.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's announcement means millions of doses will be added to
what remains.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Car accident victims and other critically injured patients in Las
Vegas won't have access to trauma care come Wednesday if doctors fail
to agree to an emergency plan passed by Clark County commissioners,
hospital officials said.</LD>
<LD>   With the threat of the valley's only trauma center closing next
week, commissioners have approved a plan to try to lure back doctors
who recently resigned from county-operated University Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a very important, life-or-death situation," County
Commissioner Erin Kenny said.</LD>
<TE>   At least 60 specialists of the 1,400 doctors at UMC have resigned
or asked for leaves of absence from the facility in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors say they fear the on-call and emergency room work puts
them at high risk for medical malpractice cases at a time when
malpractice insurance rates are skyrocketing.</TE>

<HD>Authorities Shut Down Huge Drug Operation</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank tellers in Spokane smelled marijuana on the weekly cash deposits
from an interior design business. They told authorities, who cracked
a huge indoor pot-growing operation.</LD>
<LD>   The marijuana was being grown in homes ranging in value from
$136,000 to more than $343,000, including one on Spokane's scenic
High Drive.</LD>
<LD>   Five people in their 50s and 60s were arrested on federal drug
charges. The five made initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Cynthia Imbrogno on charges of manufacture of more than 100
marijuana plants.</LD>
<TE>   "This was literally right under everybody's nose," U.S. Atty.
James McDevitt said. "It represents a sizable and sophisticated drug
operation. The potential for the loss of assets [by the defendants]
is pretty great."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors moved to seize seven homes in Spokane and an
eighth residence in Lewiston, Idaho, with a combined market value
exceeding $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Agents also searched a Moses Lake farm where investigators say
they believe the marijuana grown in Spokane was processed.</TE>

<LD>Islamic terrorists consider Seattle an "easy target" because of its
relatively high crime rate and a perception that police staffing
levels are low, the FBI warned area officials.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Mandigo, FBI special agent in charge of the Seattle
office, told the King County Council that terrorists consider the
area an "easy target," and an undisclosed number of potential local

<HD>Bush to Undergo Medical Procedure, Yield Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush today is scheduled to undergo what White
House physicians called a ''routine, preventive'' colonoscopy, and
while he is under sedation, the powers of the presidency will
temporarily transfer to Vice President Dick Cheney.</LD>
<LD>   Bush disclosed the news Friday as he departed the White House, en
route by helicopter to the Camp David presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, where the procedure would be
performed.</LD>
<LD>   The transfer of power is only the second time in U.S. history that
the 25th Amendment to the Constitution will have been invoked,
providing for the temporary transfer of power to the vice president.
The first time was July 13, 1985, when President Reagan underwent
colon cancer surgery.</LD>
<TE>   The colonoscopy will be Bush's third--a precaution because of what
Bush's doctor called ''a history of [benign] colon polyps.'' The
procedure is designed to prevent and detect colon cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The president said he decided to transfer power to Cheney
''because we're at war and I just want to be super--you know, super
cautious.''</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the vice president, Bush then quipped: ''He's
standing by. He'll realize he's not going to be president that
long.''</TE>
<TE>   Bush's colonoscopy is expected to last 30 to 45 minutes, Air Force
Col. Richard J. Tubb, the president's doctor, told reporters Friday
at a White House briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Barring complications, Tubb said, the president could even
exercise by this afternoon, which Bush, 55, said he intends to do.</TE>
<TE>   Citing general security precautions, administration officials were
unusually tight-lipped about most aspects of Bush's colonoscopy, such
as the scheduled time of the procedure and Cheney's planned
whereabouts during the time that he will be acting president.</TE>
<TE>   ''I really don't want to put out a time, and I hope you
understand,'' Bush told reporters on the South Lawn. As for Cheney,
he added, ''I'm not sure where he'll be.''</TE>
<TE>   ''Just say Washington,'' said Mary Matalin, the vice president's
counselor. She said Cheney often works on Saturdays and planned to do
so today. ''It will be a routine day,'' Matalin added.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said it was ''likely''
that Cheney would be at the White House for a portion of the day.</TE>
<TE>   During the procedure, Tubb said, Bush will be sedated
intravenously with the drug Propofol.</TE>
<TE>   The dosage will be adjusted based on the president's level of
comfort--or discomfort, he said. Thus, it does not necessarily mean
that Bush will be unconscious during the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   ''The anesthesiologist in this particular case will be able to
dial the medication to exactly the right level where the president is
comfortable but at the same time relaxed enough that they can get a
good exam,'' Tubb said.</TE>
<TE>   Propofol is such a fast-acting drug that it can put a patient to
sleep within 30 to 60 seconds of administration; once stopped, a
patient can awake within two to four minutes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some patients spurn anesthesia during a colonoscopy, but Bush
concurred with Tubb's recommendation to undergo sedation.</TE>
<TE>   Colonoscopy involves the insertion of a flexible fiber-optic scope
through the rectum to allow doctors to see the lining of the colon on
a monitor.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is the recommended procedure for somebody who's had polyps
before,'' Tubb said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's previous colonoscopies were in July 1998 and December 1999.
Each time, two small adenomatous polyps were detected and removed,
Tubb said.</TE>
<TE>   ''The last time we did one of these colonoscopies, they found
benign polyps and they recommended that ... they take another look
and see if there's anything in there,'' the president explained.</TE>
<TE>   Such polyps, once removed, ''present no problem whatsoever, and
that's why I say this is preventive medicine,'' Tubb added.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's almost become kind of an art, where you're looking not only
at the fact that you've got a polyp there, you're looking at the size
of the polyp, you're looking at the histological character, the
microscopic characteristics of the polyp, the family history of the
patient, the number of the polyps,'' the physician said.</TE>
<TE>   Colonoscopies have become so routine that the medical facilities
at Camp David are more than adequate to accommodate today's
procedure, he said. But the physician declined to go into details
about the facilities at the well-guarded compound.</TE>
<TE>   ''At Camp David, we can provide all the services, including
[addressing] any complications at that point,'' Tubb said.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that there are ''risks of complications'' from
colonoscopies but added: ''The complications that theoretically could
arise generally are not ones that are immediate and life-threatening.
In fact, more often than not, they're ones that manifest themselves
over hours or even days.''</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of power will be made shortly before the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will sign a written declaration voluntarily transferring the
powers of his office to Cheney. The document then is to be faxed to
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Senate President Pro Tem
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.).</TE>
<TE>   The men were briefed on the procedure by the White House Friday
afternoon. White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales said that, as a
matter of courtesy, the White House also will call Hastert and Byrd
this morning.</TE>
<TE>   When the colonoscopy is completed and Bush is able once more to
fully assume the duties and powers of the presidency, he will fax a
second declaration to Hastert and Byrd.</TE>
<TE>   In his last physical, on Aug. 4, Bush was found to be in good
health, with no sign of hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis or heart
disease--only a mild, high-frequency hearing loss and some
sports-related injuries, including lower-back pain caused by
weightlifting.</TE>
<TE>   The president, an avid runner as well as a weightlifter, just last
week launched a physical fitness campaign to encourage Americans to
get more exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Because polyps can be a precursor to colon cancer, physicians
recommend colonoscopies for patients who are over 50 years old as a
matter of routine screening. But health insurance coverage for such
procedures is still far from common. According to Tubb, 4.3 million

<TE>   Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer,
striking an estimated 135,400 Americans last year and killing 56,700.</TE>
<TE>   Women are slightly more likely than men to have colon cancer,
while men are slightly more likely to have rectal cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The most important risk factors for colorectal cancer are a family
history of the disease, a family history of polyps and inflammatory
bowel disease. Other risk factors include smoking, lack of exercise,
a high fat/low fiber diet and alcohol consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Polyps are small, balloon-like growths on the interior of the
large intestine and are normally precursors of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But many years are required for a polyp to become cancerous, and
early detection and removal of polyps sharply reduces the risk of
developing malignancies.</TE>
<TE>   The American Cancer Society and other health organizations now
recommend that adults undergo colonoscopy at age 50 and, if no polyps
are found, every 10 years after that.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, sigmoidoscopy, which is used to study the lower
third of the large intestine, is recommended every five years.</TE>
<TE>   Only about a third of Americans older than 50 have ever had a
colonoscopy, according to the American Cancer Society.</TE>

<HD>Business Reform on Bush Agenda</HD>
<DH>Policy: As more scandals emerge, the White House plans a
major address. Democrats say the GOP created a climate that fostered
fiscal abuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Moving to bolster its response to corporate scandals,
the White House said Friday that President Bush will deliver a major
address on corporate responsibility to Wall Street next month and
signaled a willingness to work with congressional Democrats on
business reform legislation many Republicans have resisted.</LD>
<LD>   For a third straight day, Bush had strong words for corporate
wrongdoers, declaring: "When we catch people doing wrong, there will
be consequences."</LD>
<LD>   The president also planned to make business ethics the subject of
his radio address today. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Bush will deliver his major address on corporate responsibility in
New York on July 9. Fleischer declined to say whether Bush intends to
propose additional measures beyond his March initiative to improve
corporate conduct and accountability.</LD>
<TE>   But Fleischer said the president shares the goal of a measure
drafted by Senate Democrats that would make corporate officers more
accountable for the accuracy of their companies' financial
statements. "We'll continue to work with the Congress on this,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "[The president] believes that we need more disclosure [of
financial information] ... increased corporate responsibility and a
crackdown on corporate wrongdoing," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   The comments from Bush and Fleischer came as the chief executive
of WorldCom Inc.--the company whose disclosure this week of $3.9
billion in improper accounting rocked the corporate and political
worlds--sent a letter to Bush telling the president he "rightly
expressed outrage and concern about past accounting irregularities"
at the company.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom President and CEO John Sidgmore also pledged to cooperate
with the government in its investigation and "set an example by
accepting responsibility and taking decisive action."</TE>
<TE>   Still another case of questionable corporate conduct surfaced
Friday as Xerox disclosed that it had improperly recorded $6.4
billion in revenue over a five-year period.</TE>
<TE>   At the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
assailed the administration and the Republican-controlled House for
not doing more to crack down on corporate abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to reform and strengthen the system," Daschle said.
"Unfortunately, the desire for reform is not to be found in the
approaches taken by the White House, the House, and the SEC
[Securities and Exchange Commission]."</TE>
<TE>   The responses underscored the potency of the corporate scandals as
a campaign issue--one that Democrats hope to use to portray Bush and
his fellow Republicans as too cozy with big business.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are working hard to show they are equally outraged
by the scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial
Services subcommittee on capital markets, said Friday that he is
optimistic that the House and Senate can come together and pass a
reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, we will get a bill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The House in April approved a bill that would create a board to
oversee auditors and impose new financial disclosure requirements on
publicly traded companies. Democrats, who control the Senate, favor a
tougher measure--one that would, among other things, go further in
limiting the amount of consulting that accounting firms may provide
to companies they audit.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate reform efforts, inspired by Enron Corp.'s collapse
last year, appeared to be sputtering in recent weeks. But they
quickly moved back to the top of the Washington agenda this week
after revelations that WorldCom had improperly accounted for $3.9
billion. That disclosure, key lawmakers said Friday, should be enough
to push both parties to try to reach a consensus on reform
legislation. Indeed, after Bush delivers his radio address on
business ethics today, it will be the subject of the Democratic
response.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups are now among those lobbying for something they
usually fight--new regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is in a different mind-set than it was six months
ago," Baker said. "They want closure. There is far too much money
sitting on the sidelines because people are afraid of analysts, CEOs
and accountants, and they don't know if they're getting honest
information. That's not good for anybody, Democrat or Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said he too has received calls from corporate CEOs urging
him to pass legislation. "They are as appalled, if not more so, than
we are," he said. "I've had numerous conversations with very
prominent and high-profile CEOs who are very concerned about what
this has done to the perception of the corporate sector in our
society."</TE>
<TE>   For Bush and congressional Republicans, corporate reform is a
political imperative.</TE>
<TE>   "[White House political advisor] Karl Rove and the Bush political
operation ought to be at DEFCON 1," said Larry Sabato, director of
the University of Virginia Center for Politics, referring to the high
state of military alertness.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bush does not act swiftly and convincingly, the Republicans
could be looking at a surprisingly bad November picture, including
the loss of the House and a growing Democratic margin in the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Some who have closely watched the corporate reform debate said
they sense movement by House Republicans to support the tougher
measure drafted by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the House GOP caucus had stuck to its guns on accounting
reform, showing no interest in compromising ... the WorldCom news, in
conjunction with other negative economic reports, could gain
sufficient political traction over the summer to scupper the GOP's
strategy for another narrow House majority," said Patrick Basham, a
senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "So House Republicans are probably going to buy themselves some
political insurance....They'll do this by finding some common ground
with the Senate version in time for the campaign, a strategy that the
White House probably won't object to publicly."</TE>
<TE>   Peggy Peterson, spokeswoman for Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio),
chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said: "I don't
know if these bills are as far apart as everyone likes to portray
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a bit of a bad rap that our bill is 'weak' because it
is more general," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we ought to give the regulators some flexibility in how
to create this board," Peterson continued.</TE>
<TE>   Some see the corporate scandals as the issue that Democrats have
been waiting for.</TE>
<TE>   "The Democrats clearly need an issue, and they may have found one
by blasting Republican appointees for being too close to companies
they are supposed to regulate," said Greg Valliere, chief strategist
for Schwab Washington Research Group.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush undoubtedly realizes that the GOP could be vulnerable on
this issue and he wants at all costs to avoid presiding over a weak
stock market and a mediocre economy, as his father did."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats were doing all they could to keep the heat on
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle on Friday took the Senate floor--on a day when almost all
other senators had left town to start a weeklong Fourth of July
recess--to assail the GOP response to the scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, he said, is "a deregulatory, permissive atmosphere
that has relied too much on corporate America to police itself. It's
as if the line between right and wrong, legal and illegal, acceptable
and unacceptable was so little enforced that it became blurred."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the Capitol, House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) challenged House Republican leaders to bring
legislation to the floor that would crack down on offshore tax
havens, portraying the measure as patriotic and accusing
"hard-headed" Republican leaders of kowtowing to special interests by
refusing to let it come up for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans went on the counteroffensive.</TE>
<TE>   The National Republican Congressional Committee sent a memo to GOP
candidates telling them to remind voters that the GOP-controlled
House already had passed accounting and pension reform bills before
the WorldCom scandal broke, while the Democratic-run Senate has yet
to act.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration wants to bring in 100 experienced fire
managers from Australia and New Zealand to enable the government to
put 1,000 more people on the ground fighting wildfires in the West.</LD>
<LD>   But before that can happen, those governments are demanding that
they and their citizens be protected from lawsuits for firefighting
mistakes. To alleviate such concerns, a House panel met Friday to try
to speed passage of a bill by Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.) to treat
foreign firefighters as U.S. employees.</LD>
<LD>   The panel heard testimony from administration officials and
expects to vote on the bill in late July. The bill also would require
that foreign countries extend the same courtesy to U.S. firefighters
who go overseas to help out.</LD>
<TE>   "Members of this committee, by virtue of acting on this bill, will
also convey their gratitude to foreign firefighters," said Rep.
George W. Gekas (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's
immigration, border security and claims subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, foreign firefighters, the countries that send them
and any groups associated with those firefighters would not be liable
for errors in their firefighting activities, said Deputy Associate
Atty. Gen. Paul Clinton Harris Sr.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would provide the same protection to U.S.
firefighters who go to other countries, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the bill still would allow lawsuits on claims against
foreign firefighters, but the Justice Department would move to
substitute the U.S. as the defendant and dismiss the foreign
firefighters from such cases.</TE>
<TE>   With wildfires raging in the West, the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho, says there is a pressing need for 100 more
seasoned firefighters with experience as midlevel supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "The Australian states and New Zealand have these resources
available and are willing to help," said Tim Hartzell, who directs
the Interior Department's Office of Wildland Fire Coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Adding 100 experienced supervisors from overseas would let U.S.
officials hire an additional 1,000 firefighting recruits, Hartzell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Australia and New Zealand firefighters helped the United States
during the 2000 fire season, the nation's worst in half a century,
when nearly 1.4 million acres had burned at this point in the fire
season. This year, it's 2.6 million acres.</TE>
<TE>   "On the long-term outlook, with the drought continuing to be in
the forecast, and the heavy fuel load in our forests, it does not
bode well for the remainder of the fire season," Hartzell said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the U.S. had agreements with Australia and New Zealand,
Hartzell said, but they were not put into effect because of concerns
about potential lawsuits.</TE>

<HD>Residents Begin Touring Homes Lost to Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Arizona: Show Low now appears in the clear, and evacuees
may return within days. But the blaze now threatens 600 more
residences nearby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHOW LOW, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Some people who lost their homes in a huge wildfire toured the ashes
and rubble for the first time Friday as the blaze crept up rugged
terrain toward another group of more than 600 homes.</LD>
<LD>   Lana Page from Tucson saw the ashes of her new two-story log
cabin, a vacation home near Show Low that she and her husband had
spent three years building. The couple had stayed one weekend there.</LD>
<LD>   "We got to eat in it for the first time," Page said, choking up.
"It was an accomplished dream. It's hard to see your dreams go up in
smoke so fast."</LD>
<TE>   Heading west, the road from Show Low to the hard-hit Heber and
Overgaard communities was marked by strips of road turned copper-red
from fire retardant. The landscape showed black skeletons of pine
trees, soot-covered wedding china and a charred saguaro cactus
sculpture made of beer and pop cans. Scarred metal, springs and
melted tires were all that remained of a Volvo.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing was rockin' and rollin' when it came through here,"
fire information officer Dick Fleischman said of the fire, which
charred hundreds of homes and vast stands of timber. "This place
never had a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Farther west, the fire jumped a containment line and inched its
way toward the southern edge of Forest Lakes Estates, an evacuated
subdivision of pine-surrounded homes 40 miles west of Show Low.
Tankers buzzed overhead, dropping thousands of gallons of retardant
on the northwestern flank of the 417,000-acre blaze.</TE>
<TE>   The fire spotted across Arizona Highway 260 into the subdivision,
but crews put them out, fire information officer David Killebrew
said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was about a mile from the subdivision Friday afternoon,
and gray smoke spiraled thousands of feet into the sky as the flames
spread. It reached the top of a plateau called the Mogollon Rim.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very concerned," said Tim Grier, who owns Forest Lakes
Touring Center and Cabins. "I've been there for 22 years. We were
optimistic until [Thursday], when the fire activity picked up."</TE>
<TE>   After several days of favorable weather, the humidity dropped and
winds picked up Friday. Forest Lakes Estates sits on a plateau above
steep canyons. Firefighters carved a line in one of those canyons,
but it didn't hold.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 firefighters were in Forest Lakes to put out any flames
started by embers from the advancing firestorm, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Other crews made their stand along a pair of roads, including
Arizona 260. If the fire jumps the highway, it would spread into
thick stands of ponderosa pine that stretch for 30 to 40 miles.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew the fire season was going to be bad," Gov. Jane Dee
Hull told evacuees in Payson. "I don't think anybody thought it was
going to be this bad."</TE>
<TE>   In little more than a week, the largest fire in Arizona history
has destroyed at least 423 homes, making it one of the most
destructive ever in the West. It has forced about 30,000 evacuations
in nine communities and left twisted, melted skeletons of homes in
its wake.</TE>
<TE>   The fire is just 10% contained, and officials say 350 miles of
fire line will be needed to encircle the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   The abandoned town of Show Low is seemingly out of danger, and its
7,700 residents hope to return in a few days. Those who lost their
homes in hard-hit communities west of Forest Lakes--Heber, Overgaard
and others--were to get a first look at their loss in van tours
Friday and today.</TE>
<TE>   Iwana Colley, 75, said each day she is away from her Overgaard
home grows more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "The waiting is terrible, and my nerves are right at the breaking
point," she said. "I'd like to go home, but I want it to be safe."</TE>
<TE>   Hull, who owns a cabin in the evacuated town of Pinetop-Lakeside,
toured that area by air Friday. "I thank you for being the spirit of
the White Mountains," she told the evacuees. "You live up here
because you love it, but the strength it takes to live up in the
mountains sometimes is what we're seeing now."</TE>
<TE>   Of 19 large fires in the Lower 48 states this year, eight were in
Colorado. Fire officials there reported good news: The 137,000-acre
Hayman fire, the largest in state history, is expected to be fully
contained Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Near Durango, Colo., a 71,000-acre fire remained only 30%
contained after destroying at least 57 homes and forcing hundreds of
residents to evacuate.</TE>

<HD>High Court Blocks Open Immigration Hearings</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The Bush team filed the case to keep proceedings
secret despite an appeals panel's ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, heeding Bush administration concerns about
national security, blocked a federal judge Friday from letting the
public into immigration hearings resulting from the Sept. 11
terrorism investigations.</LD>
<LD>   It was the high court's first decision arising from the Justice
Department's strict, closed-door approach to the hearings, and it
preserved the government's controversial strategy of conducting
secret hearings of immigrants swept up in the investigations.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court justices, without comment, put on hold a New
Jersey district judge's ruling that the Justice Department's approach
to secrecy was excessive. The high court did not rule on the merits
of the case.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. appeals court in Philadelphia is expected to consider the
New Jersey ruling within the next few months, and the entire matter
could ultimately return to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Until Friday's Supreme Court action, the New Jersey ruling had
opened up the prospect that dozens of immigration hearings stemming
from the Sept. 11 investigations could be opened to the public,
prompting the Bush administration to seek an emergency stay of the
New Jersey ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extraordinary case, touching on the nation's very
ability to defend itself against the continuing threat of hostile
attack from myriad and unknown sources," Solicitor General Theodore
B. Olson argued in a court filing on behalf of Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft. "The vital interests at stake here demand that the
government not lose its ability to protect the national security" by
even temporarily opening the hearings to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Olson argued that the hearings could reveal sensitive evidence
about detainees' links to terrorism and information about what
government investigators have learned, which could benefit
terrorists. Immigrants caught up in the investigations enjoyed no
general 1st Amendment right of public access to their immigration
proceedings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But others argued that the administration's insistence on a
complete veil of secrecy around cases that have typically involved
routine immigration violations is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   More than 750 people have been detained on immigration violations
during the Sept. 11 investigations, according to the Justice
Department. By mid-June, the number still held had dropped to 74,
with apparently none connected to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, or to other acts of terrorism.
Throughout the investigations, immigrant rights advocates, civil
libertarians and media organizations have sought basic information
about those who have been detained by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, one of the attorneys arguing in the New
Jersey case against the Justice Department maintained that Ashcroft's
approach was too sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no attempt to try to balance the government's interest
in confidentiality with the public's right to know and the
immigrant's right to a public trial," said David Cole, a Georgetown
University law professor. "It's unprecedented to have hundreds of
people locked up in secret and tried in secret."</TE>
<TE>   The legal dispute was sparked by the Justice Department policy
after Sept. 11 of demanding closed hearings for immigrants detained
as part of the terrorism investigations. The practice was challenged
by the American Civil Liberties Union and a group of New Jersey
publications.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, U.S. District Judge John Bissell in Newark, N.J.,
ruled that such secrecy should be applied only on a case-by-case
basis. That put the burden on federal prosecutors to show that public
access to a hearing would harm their terrorism investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said it
would consider an appeal of the case but declined to derail Bissell's
ruling in the interim. The Supreme Court's action Friday gives the
appeals court time to review the New Jersey ruling, while blocking
its immediate impact. The administration has asked the appeals court
to overturn the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Olson told the high court that opening the hearings to the public,
even temporarily, could fundamentally undermine the government's
terrorism investigations. "The harms that would result from
disclosure can never be undone," he said. Olson's wife, Barbara, a
commentator and lawyer, died aboard one of the hijacked jets Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "That an individual in this country could be deprived of his or
her liberty in a secret, closed-door proceeding is an extraordinary
proposition, one that finds no support in this court's case law or in
history," ACLU lawyers said in opposition to the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   They said even the trials of individuals charged with terrorism
are being held in open federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the New Jersey ruling, a federal court in Michigan also
found the Justice Department's approach to be unconstitutional, and
that case also is on appeal.</TE>

<HD>Fires Rekindle Campaign to Thin Forests</HD>
<DH>Prevention: Officials say clearing trees would help avoid
devastating blazes. But critics fear involving the logging industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Flying by helicopter over the Hayman fire in Colorado
earlier this month, national forest Chief Dale Bosworth spied a swath
of green persisting amid the orange flames.</LD>
<LD>   The green was a section of Pike National Forest that federal
officials had thinned last year and treated with a controlled burn to
help prevent catastrophic forest fires. When the devastating fire
reached that section of the forest it diminished, burning what little
underbrush remained and failing to ignite the tall trees.</LD>
<LD>   That not only spared the big ponderosa pines but also gave
Bosworth ammunition to argue for more active management of Western
forests.</LD>
<TE>   Now Bush administration officials and some members of Congress
hope that the fires raging in Arizona and Colorado will be a catalyst
for a massive campaign of thinning and clearing trees and underbrush
in Western forests.</TE>
<TE>   "It does work," Bosworth said in an interview. "We just need to
get the public's support to do it more aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1920s, the federal government has extinguished
low-intensity fires, which burn underbrush and small trees. But it
has allowed timber harvests of the largest trees, which are least
susceptible to fire. The result is that the forests across much of
the West are crammed with undergrowth and small trees, the ideal
fodder for fire of a scale that was not imaginable a few decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The fires we're having now are not natural fires," said Mark Rey,
who as Agriculture Department undersecretary oversees the U.S. Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "The stands are so dense and the amount of fuel--wood--is so large
that the fires are burning destructively and catastrophically," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 70 to 80 million acres have to be thinned to prevent the
kind of colossal fires that have menaced the West in recent decades,
Rey said. But at the rate the federal government is moving now--about
2 million acres a year--that process would take many decades.</TE>
<TE>   That the forests should be thinned is not so controversial as who
should thin them. The Bush administration favors the timber industry
for its know-how and because those companies could use the profit
from whatever wood they remove to offset costs.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, suspecting the industry of wanting to cut the
big trees and leave the undergrowth, prefers that the government do
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has approved money for small-scale thinning and
controlled burns by federal foresters and local contractors, such as
occurred last year in Pike National Forest. The Bush administration
is proposing to hire timber companies to remove underbrush from
forests along with enough marketable trees to make the effort pay
off--as long as they leave the largest and oldest trees behind.
Payment for the cleanup would take the form of timber rather than
public funds.</TE>
<TE>   Rey and Bosworth complain that the Forest Service has been stymied
by some environmental groups, which suspect the administration of
using fire protection to screen its real objective: increasing
commercial logging.</TE>
<TE>   "If we really care about these forests, this has to be our top
priority," Rey said. "We have to stop being sidetracked."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who agrees, recently urged a number of
environmental groups to suspend their suspicions and support Forest
Service efforts to thin forests. The only way to thin the forests
quickly enough to protect people, he says, is to let timber companies
earn a profit while they do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough money to have the government fund it,"
McCain said. "You probably have got to have commercial operations
doing this and have them make some money off the deal."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists charge that timber companies for decades have
stripped national forests of old-growth trees, damaging habitats and
ecosystems. Sean Cosgrove, national forest policy specialist for the
Sierra Club, said he did not trust commercial logging firms.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll claim to do fuel reduction and in the process take out
commercial timber," he said. "They're going to take out more
commercial timber than flammable brush."</TE>
<TE>   Cosgrove favors using only federal funds for the projects. He
stressed that the Forest Service should not aim to thin and treat all
the forests, only those closest to communities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a good spending of resources to thin all 140 million
acres of national forests with trees," Cosgrove said. "The priority
should be protecting lives and communities."</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona University professor William "Wally" Covington
has been making a case for a revolution in forest management for more
than 20 years. He calls it "restoration" forestry.</TE>
<TE>   He advocates returning the forests to their state before Europeans
came to North America, when the ponderosa pine forests that have been
plagued with devastating fires in recent years held about 20 to 50
large trees per acre. Frequent fires ignited by lightning or by
Native Americans kept them in that state. Now, the forests are packed
with 300 to 500 trees per acre, many of them smaller and more
flammable.</TE>
<TE>   In several areas that had been "restored," the large trees have
survived raging forest fires. In adjacent areas, higher-intensity
fires, stoked by the underbrush and densely packed small trees,
killed the large trees, Covington said.</TE>
<TE>   Covington said he believes this year's fires will finally turn the
tide. "It's been discussed for some time, but these fires have been
the real triggering event," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt helped promote restoration
forestry as a key part of the national fire plan, which was enacted
after the 2000 fires. But he warns against getting timber companies
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a Trojan horse for a revival of logging," Babbitt said.
"What they want to do is go in and cut down the old-growth trees....
And they're not causing the fire problem."</TE>
<TE>   Babbitt also warned against expanding the program too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can accelerate the pace, but it can't be done
overnight," he said. "This is very expensive and time-consuming work.
You don't want to smother a good program with money that could be
misused in the haste."</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth said that, although this type of fire prevention effort
has been underway for some time, the public still resists the
projects in part because people have gotten used to the way forests
look when they're crowded with trees and underbrush and prefer them
that way.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a public consensus. We end up with a lot of arguing,"
Bosworth said. "Maybe [the fires] will help people understand the
wisdom of doing the active management."</TE>
<TE>   Bosworth cautioned that even if the country made a big commitment
now, it would take years before the West stopped experiencing fires
as intense as those in Arizona and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to start now and stick with it for 10 to 15 years,"
Bosworth said. "Then we will see some significant difference in the
way these fires burn."</TE>

<HD>U.S., in Shift, Looks to Allies to Help in Development of a
Missile Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon has begun a new effort to develop its missile defense
system the way President Reagan originally envisioned it: as an
international project that would protect not only the United States
but also its friends around the globe from missile attack.</LD>
<LD>   With the U.S. withdrawal this month from the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty, which limited such systems, Defense Department officials say
they are now free to propose to foreign governments and companies a
variety of joint efforts to develop and test new missile defense
products and to cooperate in deployment of the equipment.</LD>
<LD>   In this new phase, the Pentagon's biggest acquisition program will
be reshaped as ''a bridge to our allies and friends,'' Lt. Gen.
Ronald Kadish, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, said
earlier this month in remarks at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank.</LD>
<TE>   Western Europe and Japan head the list of regions that U.S.
defense officials envision as part of a patchwork of missile defense
systems working jointly. Allies would play different roles, sometimes
jointly developing pieces of the systems, taking part in testing or
exercises, or simply allowing use of air fields or ports.</TE>
<TE>   But winning agreement even from close allies promises to be
difficult, not only because of international skepticism about the
need for missile defense but also because of budget and security
issues and complex regional politics that prevent friendly nations
from always lining up with U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   Turning missile defense into a cooperative venture serves an
important political purpose for the administration: It can help
combat the perception that missile defense demonstrates how Bush
prefers to go it alone, even in the face of international opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Yet U.S. officials and experts say there are also reasons why
missile defense must be an international program if it is to work at
all.</TE>
<TE>   As a practical matter, the United States remains vulnerable to
coercion by missile-armed nations as long as they can threaten key
allies, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Pentagon were certain it could shield New York and Los
Angeles, an adversary could force the U.S. hand by menacing an allied
capital. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, for example, might influence
U.S. plans for an attack in the Middle East by threatening London,
Paris or Berlin, said Jacques F. Gansler, former undersecretary of
Defense for acquisitions and technology.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have always thought that a threat to our major allies was a
threat to us as well,'' he said. ''It's in our interest to protect
these capitals, as well as New York and Los Angeles.''</TE>
<TE>   Missile defense also needs to be a cooperative venture because of
the U.S. practice of fighting wars in battlefield coalitions.</TE>
<TE>   If an incoming missile is streaking toward a joint force, ''you're
not going to say, 'I wonder whose troops it's heading for,' ''
Gansler said. ''You're going to need to protect the entire force.''</TE>
<TE>   Another key reason is the Pentagon's need to have foreign
governments' permission to move missile defense equipment through
foreign territory to base it near the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Several kinds of antimissile systems perform better if their
radar, infrared sensors and missile interceptors are close to the
source of the attack. The Pentagon might want permission to move
antimissile Aegis cruisers through foreign ports and land airborne
laser aircraft at foreign air bases.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department could minimize this need by turning to a
space-based system, but that kind of system is still many years from
completion and is as yet unproved.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has already been working on a variety of missile
defense projects with allies.</TE>
<TE>   These include the Arrow medium-range missile defense system, which
is underway with the Israelis, and the Medium Extended Air Defense
System, or MEADS, a mobile system to protect troops that the Pentagon
is working on with Germany and Italy. The United States and Japan
have been jointly researching several kinds of missile component
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because of the ABM Treaty requirements, U.S. officials say,
the joint projects have until now been limited to short-range missile
systems. The United States was also barred from basing abroad any
component of a system, such as radars, that would be part of a
national defense against long-range missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials intended to focus their effort on forging deals
with Japan and European countries, possibly including Russia. Their
first emphasis will be on missile defense systems designed to protect
troops overseas--the area on which there is greatest agreement on the
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, experts and defense contractors believe it will be tricky
to make such ventures work.</TE>
<TE>   One issue is the political ambivalence about missile defense in
these allied countries, where many people still wonder about the
extent of the threat and fear that building defenses could provoke
other countries to expand their arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, worries about the missile threat have risen sharply
since North Korea test-fired a long-range missile across Japan in
August 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Japanese have so far resisted U.S. pressure to
plunge more deeply into missile defense development. Japan continues
to spend only a few tens of millions of dollars on the program and
refers to the effort as ''research'' rather than ''development''--to
avoid any perception that they are committed to the program.</TE>
<TE>   ''They're being very wary,'' said Derek J. Mitchell, a former
Pentagon specialist on East Asia who is now a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In Western Europe, worries about the U.S. passion for missile
defense have subsided somewhat because of Russia's official
acquiescence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet many Europeans worry that the big project could be
destabilizing and fret about what they see as a gradual U.S.
withdrawal from joint security arrangements with allies.</TE>
<TE>   To sell projects in Europe, ''I think they'll have a real
challenge,'' said Terrence Taylor, head of the U.S. operation of the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is the technical difficulty of managing a joint
venture that seeks to develop such complex and untried technology.</TE>
<TE>   Experts note a long line of failed efforts between allied
countries to develop cutting-edge technologies, including the
U.S.-Japanese effort to build the FX fighter plane in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   And the United States may not want to share with foreigners
high-tech information that could compromise national security or that
was proprietary to American defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Budgets are another issue. While the Pentagon says it will accept
other contributions to the effort, such as basing rights, the
unwillingness of Europe and Japan to contribute much money could
strain the undertaking.</TE>
<TE>   There is reluctance to agree to such ventures when there is so
much uncertainty about the cost, which depends heavily on what
technologies are finally chosen. The U.S. investment is estimated to
be $48 billion just through 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Europe's long reluctance to increase defense spending has been a
chronic source of friction with the United States in NATO. European
defense budgets are now flat, and Japan continues to be mired in a
recession.</TE>
<TE>   ''Ultimately, it's going to be the United States that pays the
lion's share,'' said Kurt Campbell, who was the Pentagon's top Asia
specialist during the Clinton administration and is now executive
vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</TE>

<HD>Jeep Is Checked for Clues to Missing Utah Girl</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Police investigating the abduction of a Utah girl have seized
records, including mileage, on a vehicle belonging to a handyman who
tops the list of possible suspects, a mechanic said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Neth Moul, owner of Neth's Auto Repair, also said that when the
vehicle was brought to the repair shop June 8, three days after the
disappearance of 14-year-old Elizabeth Ann Smart, it was dirty and
had insects covering the windshield.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Albert Ricci, who was arrested June 14 on an unrelated
parole violation, did work last year in the Smart home. Police said
they decided to hold him after they found discrepancies in his alibi.</LD>
<TE>   Ricci, who has a criminal record, has denied involvement in the
girl's disappearance. Police have not called him a suspect but say he
is at "the top of a list" of people who might be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Police confiscated three vehicles belonging to Ricci but returned
two of them, keeping Ricci's Jeep Cherokee for more analysis.</TE>
<TE>   According to Moul, police seized his log books recording the Ricci
repair work, dates and mileage.</TE>
<TE>   The mileage is important because the vehicle apparently had
recorded 1,000 extra miles from the time Ricci picked up the vehicle
from the mechanic May 30 and brought it back June 8.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's wife, Angela, has said her husband was with her the night
Elizabeth was kidnapped.</TE>

<HD>Bush Goes to Bat for Liberal Republican Under the Gun</HD>
<DH>Politics: Rep. Constance A. Morella often differs with the
president on policy, but she needs his fund-raising help in a tough
reelection contest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>She is a fierce supporter of abortion rights. She unabashedly touts
her environmental credentials. And she recently denounced as
"irresponsible" the farm bill that President Bush signed into law.</LD>
<LD>   On issue after issue, Rep. Constance A. Morella of Maryland has
kept her distance from the Bush administration--even though she is a
Republican.</LD>
<LD>   But Friday, Bush dutifully headlined a $400,000 fund-raiser for
the free-spirited eight-term House member, offering a classic case of
political imperatives trumping policy differences.</LD>
<TE>   Morella faces a tough reelection bid in her largely Democratic
district in suburbs north of Washington, and she needs the money that
Bush helped her raise Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The president, meanwhile, has to do everything he can to help the
GOP maintain its slender margin in the House--and that means
campaigning for Morella and the handful of other liberal Republicans
who are still around.</TE>
<TE>   Such Republicans once were a prominent faction in the party, but
their numbers have dwindled in recent decades. They now mainly
represent districts in the Northeast, while the party increasingly is
controlled by conservatives from the South and West.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, speaking at a luncheon for Morella attended by more than 400
people at a Washington hotel, all but acknowledged that he and
Morella often aren't on the same page. "A lot of people think I
probably need to spend a little quality time with her," he said amid
much knowing laughter, followed by applause.</TE>
<TE>   Bush playfully called Morella "an independent soul" and added:</TE>
<TE>   "She's a highly intellectual person who is with you if she thinks
you're right, and is gracious enough to explain to you when she
thinks ... you're wrong. And I respect that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   The president went on to thank the former English professor,
elected in 1986, for supporting some of his pet causes, such as
education reform.</TE>
<TE>   Although she's a Republican, Morella has managed to remain in good
standing among the many Democratic voters in her affluent district,
which is just across the line from the District of Columbia. One of
her clearest breaks from her party occurred in late 1998, when she
was one of the few House Republicans to vote against all four
articles of impeachment against President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   But her margins of victories have been shrinking, and her district
was reapportioned this year to include more Democratic pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Washington-based political analyst Charles Cook said that, despite
their differences, it is understandable that Bush would try to help
Morella, because she "is probably the most vulnerable [House]
Republican incumbent in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats vying to oppose Morella include Mark Shriver, son of
President Kennedy's sister, Eunice, and Sargent Shriver, the 1972
Democratic vice presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The district's Democrats will pick their nominee in a September
primary.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, insisted that, as she has in the past,
Morella will dash the Democratic hopes of unseating her.</TE>
<TE>   "Democratic predictions that they're going to beat Connie Morella
are like the swallows returning to San Juan Capistrano," he said.
"It's an annual event."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Caligiuri, Morella's campaign manager, said Bush's appearance
was the first time a president had campaigned for her.</TE>
<TE>   "Morella's relationship with this president has been very cordial,
despite their policy differences," Caligiuri said. "Personally, they
get along very well."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said of Bush's
appearance: "I think it's just further evidence that the Republican
Party is a big tent."</TE>

<HD>FBI Director Says Muslims Aid in Inquiry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III thanked Muslim Americans on Friday
for providing "substantive assistance" to the government
investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In a controversial appearance before the American Muslim Council,
Mueller noted that some people associated with the group have made
statements in the past that were supportive of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But the FBI director said the organization has moved into the
mainstream of American life and that "we must all be in this war ...
together."</LD>
<TE>   "A good relationship can only bear the fruit of a safer nation for
us all," Mueller said.</TE>
<TE>   Two rabbis held up signs protesting the FBI director's appearance
and were ushered out of the meeting of several hundred people. There
was a handful of calls beforehand for Mueller to cancel the speech.</TE>
<TE>   The American Muslim Council's former executive director has been
quoted as expressing support for the terrorist group Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller defended his appearance, saying, "It is critically
important for us to develop a strong relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has frozen the assets of some of the charities
to which the council has urged its members to contribute, citing
alleged links to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Hahya Mossa Basha of Royal Oak, Mich., the council's board
chairman, said the council does not support terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the FBI is to protect Americans; it is not to have
its director speak to an organization that has supported other
organizations" linked to terrorism, said Rabbi Avi Weiss, a
protester, in an interview. He is president of the Coalition for
Jewish Concerns and senior rabbi at the Hebrew Institute of
Riverdale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said many Muslims in the United States have volunteered to
serve as Arabic translators. That allowed the FBI to double the
number of its Arabic experts.</TE>

<HD>As Rate Rises, Can Postal Service Deliver?</HD>
<DH>Mail: The latest increase may not be enough to solve budget
and operational problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA FACKLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Postal Service blames a combination of e-mail
competition, the anthrax scare and the recent recession. Mailers
blame the postal service's own ability to cope.</LD>
<LD>   But whatever the reason, the price of mailing a letter is about to
go up again.</LD>
<LD>   The first-class letter that now costs 34 cents will cost 37 cents
as of Sunday. That three-penny increase is the largest in the steady
price climb of recent years and was the entire cost of mailing a
letter as recently as 1932.</LD>
<TE>   And even the latest hike--nearly 10%--may not be enough to balance
the postal service's budget against an anticipated $1.5-billion loss
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials worry that the increase won't help because the
volume of mail may be falling faster than the price is rising.</TE>
<TE>   "The model we're operating under now just isn't sustainable,"
postal service spokesman Garry Kreinkamp said. He worries that the
day is not far off when price increases hurt more than they help.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the cost and effectiveness of some signature post office
services have come into question in a March report by the Office of
the Consumer Advocate, an arm of the independent Postal Rate
Commission, which represents the interests of the public. The report
cited a range of problems, from the availability of window clerks to
Priority Mail service.</TE>
<TE>   The report suggests that the post office misleads customers into
using Priority Mail, a more costly service that promises delivery in
two to three days for letter-weight items. But the report said
delivery times for priority and first-class mail are equal because
they are shipped together--even though investigators were told
Priority Mail would be shipped using the Express Mail network.</TE>
<TE>   Priority Mail took as much as three days longer to be delivered
than advertised, said Shelley Dreifuss, director of the office that
produced the report. "The postal service hasn't really been providing
services of as high a quality as they ought to," she said. "If you
can't live up to your promises, then at least tell the public
honestly what you are able to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Kreinkamp said the differences between the two services are
technical. A package that weighs more than 13 ounces must be sent by
Priority Mail. "Priority Mail is first-class mail, it's just
heavier."</TE>
<TE>   He said the report overlooked key factors, such as weight and
longer-distance destination, causing delays in delivery. Half of all
letters and other first-class mail circulate within the city of
origin, but Priority Mail typically does not, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service has argued that it needs greater flexibility
and less governmental oversight to compete with private companies.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics suggest that these grievances are just the tip of the
iceberg.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Estes, head of Main Street Coalition for Postal Fairness, a
nonprofit group that represents the interests of individual and
small-volume mailers, said the postal service needs a fundamental
restructuring. The service should focus more on cutting labor costs
than raising prices, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "by and large the postal service has done a pretty
good job, given the tasks they're faced with."</TE>
<TE>   After six years of failed attempts to push postal reforms through
Congress, however, Main Street recommends the creation of a
commission to develop solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Postal service customer Chino Cardova, a security officer in
Washington, said he understands why the prices keep rising, but
added: "I just think they need to get their house in order instead of
sticking it to the consumer."</TE>
<TE>   Estes said that allowing the postal service to operate more like a
business than a government agency is risky for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of any company that would take on universal
service--coast to coast--that would offer nondiscriminatory
services," he said. "I think that most Americans look upon mail
almost as an entitlement. They feel they're entitled to send and
receive their mail at a nondiscriminatory price."</TE>

<HD>Reagan Case Was the Only Power Shift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Reagan was shot in an assassination attempt in 1981,
he underwent surgery that lasted more than three hours. When
President Clinton was injured in a fall at golfer Greg Norman's house
in Florida in 1997, he underwent two hours of surgery to repair a
tendon.</LD>
<LD>   In neither case, however, did the White House invoke the 25th
Amendment to the Constitution, as President Bush intends to do while
undergoing a colonoscopy today. The amendment provides for a
president who is disabled to turn his powers over to the vice
president while he is incapacitated.</LD>
<LD>   The amendment was enacted in 1967, four years after President
Kennedy's assassination. But the push for it began in the 1950s, when
President Eisenhower suffered a series of heart attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The amendment has only been invoked once: when Reagan underwent
colon surgery in 1985. He sent a letter to Congress saying that
George Bush, his vice president, would serve as acting president
during the surgery. Eight hours later, he wrote Congress again,
reclaiming his presidential powers.</TE>
<TE>   The 25th Amendment provides for different kinds of transfers of
power. In the event of a president's death or resignation, it allows
the new president to select a new vice president, subject to
confirmation by a majority in the House and Senate. In the event of a
president's disability, it says that ''whenever he is unable to
discharge the powers and duties of his office,'' the president may
send congressional leaders a written declaration to that effect,
valid until he sends a new letter to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment's final provision, which some legal scholars call
''the nightmare'' scenario, allows for the acting president along
with a majority of the Cabinet to write congressional leaders that
the president, despite his own wishes, is still incapable of assuming
powers. At that point, the issue would be decided by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Many scholars who have studied the amendment have said they
believe it should be invoked more often. But the political
fallout--the image of a disabled president--makes that unlikely.</TE>

<HD>Maine's Bid to Cut Drug Prices Before High Court</HD>
<DH>Policy: State program to help uninsured is put on hold.
Manufacturers see Medicaid law violation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court, raising the stakes in the increasingly populist
battle over the high cost of prescription drugs, said Friday that it
would consider the pharmaceutical industry's challenge of state
efforts to force drug prices lower.</LD>
<LD>   The court's decision prevents Maine from implementing a program
adopted two years ago to finance prescription drug coverage for
325,000 uninsured residents with discounts won in strong-arm
negotiations with drug manufacturers.</LD>
<LD>   The pharmaceutical industry immediately went to federal court to
have the Maine Rx law overturned, arguing that it violates federal
Medicaid law as well as constitutional rules on interstate commerce.</LD>
<TE>   The Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA,
succeeded in blocking the program, but the state had won the latest
round of the legal battle, in the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.
Maine also garnered the endorsement of the Bush administration, which
filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to let the program go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Escalating drug prices have strained the budgets of private
consumers and state governments in recent years, and lawmakers of
both political parties have sought to respond to growing demands for
political action. Yet the high court's intervention in the Maine
case, coming hours after the Republican-controlled House passed an
industry-supported Medicare drug benefit that Democrats criticized
for failing to address the cost issue, highlighted the significant
legal and political barriers that face all cost-containment efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The court's action also is likely to reverberate in a campaign for
the U.S. Senate that pits the Democratic author of the Maine Rx
program against Republican Sen. Susan Collins. Both candidates
expressed their disappointment over Friday's court action, but former
state Sen. Chellie Pingree said it underscored Congress'
responsibility to take on the pharmaceutical industry and makes her
''even more determined to get to Washington.''</TE>
<TE>   PhRMA officials praised the court's action, calling it ''great
news for Medicaid patients.''</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling, expected next year, could affect state budgets
and low-income citizens across the country. Legislators in roughly
half the states have been waiting to see whether Maine's law would
survive the industry's legal challenge before enacting similar
programs.</TE>
<TE>   PhRMA emphasized that fact in its petition for Supreme Court
action, arguing that ''the harmful phenomenon of state efforts to use
Medicaid leverage to exact non-Medicaid subsidies is fast
spreading.''</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, most state Medicaid drug budgets are out of control. In
virtually every state, Medicaid drug spending has grown by more than
50% since 1997; in seven states, it has increased at least 90%.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a significant national issue,'' Newell A. Augur,
director of legislative and public affairs for Maine's Department of
Human Services, said Friday. ''It is critical for every state to be
able to manage their budget and provide vital medications to the
growing population of elderly and low-income people.''</TE>
<TE>   Most states have focused their drug cost-control efforts on
Medicaid beneficiaries--increasing co-payments and restricting the
types of drugs and the number of prescriptions covered by Medicaid.
California's program, Medi-Cal, employs all those tools and for
several years has also negotiated additional discounts from
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Maine officials concentrated on reducing the cost of the
drugs--and that meant taking on the pharmaceutical industry.</TE>
<TE>   The goals of the Maine Rx program, which passed the state
Legislature almost unanimously, were simple enough: First, the state
would use its purchasing power to negotiate discounts from
pharmaceutical manufacturers greater than those required by federal
Medicaid law.</TE>
<TE>   Drug companies that refused to provide additional rebates would be
penalized in two ways: The state would publicize the companies'
refusal to lower their prices, and it would put their products on a
list of Medicaid drugs that require prior authorization from the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Maine Rx would use the money it saved in rebates to
provide prescription drug coverage to about 325,000 Maine residents
who do not have health insurance. Eligible residents would pay the
discounted price and the state would reimburse pharmacies for the
difference.</TE>
<TE>   PhRMA, the industry's largest trade association, quickly sued.</TE>
<TE>   In seeking to regulate the business practices of out-of-state drug
manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, the Maine Rx program
violates the Constitution's commerce clause, PhRMA said. In addition,
by using the state's Medicaid program to extend benefits to residents
who earn too much to qualify, Maine Rx violates federal Medicaid law,
PhRMA argued.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, the U.S. District Court in Maine accepted much of
PhRMA's reasoning and issued a preliminary injunction that blocked
implementation of Maine Rx.</TE>
<TE>   The state appealed the ruling, and in May 2001 the U.S. Court of
Appeals lifted the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   The court found that Maine Rx furthers Medicaid's aim of providing
medical services to residents whose ''income and resources are
insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services,'' even
if the individuals covered by the Maine Rx program are not poor
enough to qualify for Medicaid.</TE>
<TE>   As for the commerce clause, Maine Rx ''does not regulate conduct
occurring outside the state,'' the court said.</TE>
<TE>   PhRMA appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court, again
forestalling the start of the program.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Bush administration weighed in, siding with Maine.</TE>
<TE>   A brief filed by Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson said the case
did not merit review by the high court because Maine Rx falls within
the considerable flexibility that federal law gives states in
deciding how to shape their Medicaid programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case, PhRMA vs.
Concannon, 01-188, during its 2002-2003 term.</TE>
<TE>   In another health-care case, the court said Friday it would decide
the validity of laws in about 25 states that require health-care
plans to open their networks to all physicians, pharmacies and other
care providers who agree to abide by the plan's rules.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna Inc., Humana Inc. and other health plans challenged
Kentucky's ''any willing provider'' law, arguing that it interferes
with their cost-control efforts and violates the federal ERISA law,
which prohibits states from regulating employee benefit plans.</TE>
<TE>   The insurers are appealing a decision by the U.S. 6th Circuit
Court of Appeals that upheld the Kentucky law, finding that it was
permissible because it focused on insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The case is Kentucky Assn. of Health Plans vs. Miller, 00-1471.</TE>

<LD>This month's graduating high school seniors who were accepted by a
college a few months ago are enjoying their summer. Some juniors will
suffer the tickle of worry during their months off. With the
outpouring of students going up faster than the available slots, good
schools are selecting tinier percentages of applicants and students
are compelled to apply early, hoping to get accepted ahead of the
pack. Almost all of America's elite colleges have an "early decision"
plan, allowing students to apply in November or thereabouts. If
accepted, usually by mid-December, the students are considered bound
to attend.</LD>
<LD>   Criticism of such programs has been louder and more widespread
this school year after the Atlantic Monthly reported at length on how
the early-decision practice helped colleges at the expense of a
diverse student body. Yale University's president is calling for the
end of early decision, and Harvard may start undermining the system
this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The number of students applying early has increased dramatically
over the last decade, to 163,000 in the fall of 2000. Add to that a
study showing that applying early is like adding 100 points to a
student's SAT score, in terms of the chance of being accepted, and
the pressure to apply early is on--even for students who are not sure
where they want to go.</LD>
<TE>   Colleges like early decision because if more freshmen are accepted
early and are bound to attend, the overall percentage of accepted
students who decide to attend goes up. In college admissions lingo,
schools are artificially inflating their "yield." Schools are also
able to lock in applicants with high SAT scores and class rankings.
This boosts colleges' standings in the ridiculously influential
ranking of U.S. News &amp; World Report.</TE>
<TE>   But early decision is harmful to many students, and not only the
stressed-out ones. Students who need substantial financial aid often
have to wait and apply "regular decision" in December so they can
compare aid offers from different schools.</TE>
<TE>   Although the issue reportedly was not debated at a recent meeting
of Ivy League presidents, any reform of early-decision's flaws has to
start with the most sought-after schools. Harvard may be accepting
applications from students who have applied early elsewhere. We
support such a step.</TE>
<TE>   Ex-Yalie Garry Trudeau took hilarious aim at the tricks of college
admissions policies in his Doonesbury strips in May, skewering the
gyrations used to raise "yield." We encourage his alma mater to drop
early decision, without waiting for others to join in. More dominoes
would inevitably fall and college admissions would be fairer to rich
and poor alike.</TE>

<LD>Mainly because so much smoke and soot blows across the border from
Mexicali, Mexico, California's Imperial County violates national air
quality standards an average of one day in three. That means more
kids wheeze with asthma, more adults die of heart disease. And the
pall will get worse as corporations scramble to erect 16 new power
plants on both sides of the United States' 1,500-mile border with
Mexico--including two plants adjacent to the Imperial Valley's farms
and towns.</LD>
<LD>   No one disputes that the growing populations on both sides of the
border will require more energy. With that in mind, President Bush in
December approved permits for cross-border power transmission lines
from two natural-gas-fired plants being built in Baja California to
connect to a grid that can supply electricity anywhere between Mexico
City and the Pacific Northwest.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that only one of the two companies building these
plants near Mexicali is showing concern for the environment and
public health.</LD>
<TE>   Sempra Energy Resources' plant will be almost as clean-burning as
any standard-meeting plant constructed on U.S. soil, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency. InterGen Energy's plant is a
different story. This plant will generate 1,065 megawatts, enough
electricity for 1.5 million households. The energy from two of the
plant's four turbines will go to Mexico, the rest to the U.S. The
turbines whose electricity will head north will have add-on emissions
control devices--but even with those the facilities will be about
twice as polluting as the average California plant. The other two
will emit about 10 times more nitrogen oxides than California
permits. After Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked the
Massachusetts-based InterGen to voluntarily comply with U.S. air
quality standards, the company responded by saying their plant would
meet Mexican standards. Because those standards are far less
stringent than California's, Feinstein has introduced a bill in
Congress, co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Rep.
Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine), that would prohibit natural gas produced in
the United States from being used in power plants in Baja California
unless the plants complied with California emissions standards.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians and business leaders are right to tout the benefits of
globalization, which lets capital and energy flow more freely across
national borders. Too often, however, they conveniently forget a
simple correlate: Air too crosses boundaries. Responsible corporate
citizens do their best to protect public health and safeguard the
environment regardless of which way the wind blows.</TE>

<LD>No California governor would want to be the object of this
observation by a Nevada gambling expert: "California is clearly,
under the direction of Gov. Gray Davis, emerging as one of the
largest gaming states in America." Unfortunately for Davis and for
Californians, it's the truth.</LD>
<LD>   Back in the late 1990s, Californians got the impression from their
elected officials that the casinos being permitted under dozens of
agreements with tribes would be small, remote operations. After all,
the casinos were to be limited to established tribal lands, mostly in
rural areas. But the giant Nevada casino companies were brought in to
finance, design, build and operate a number of them. Some deals were
concocted to win tribal rights to acreage closer to cities. The
opening this week of the $262-million Pechanga Resort &amp; Casino just
off a freeway in Temecula shows which way the tribes are headed. A
crowd of 40,000 jammed the 13-story building, which houses an
88,000-square-foot casino.</LD>
<LD>   Davis had promised there would be only a modest increase in
gambling in California under the 62 agreements he signed with tribes
in 1999. Voters, barraged with tribal-sponsored ads, approved the
concept in 2000. Davis had assured voters that the agreements, called
compacts, would allow the installation of only 45,206 slot machines,
which are the biggest cash generators in casinos.</LD>
<TE>   But just last week, the state Gambling Control Commission approved
2,753 more machines, for an authorized total of 51,300, and no doubt
more will come. Casino gambling has emerged as a major, untaxed
entertainment industry in California. The laws governing it are so
loosely drawn that it will continue to expand unless Davis and the
Legislature--or the courts--draw limits.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, politicians are reluctant to seek any such limits on the
tribes, which are among their top campaign contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal clout was on display in the Legislature last Tuesday, when
a bill to ban Internet gambling in California died without a vote in
a Senate committee, even though it breezed through the same committee
two years ago. It failed this time, the bill's author said, because
"we now have a powerful Indian group in opposition."</TE>
<TE>   Several tribes in the Sacramento and San Francisco Bay areas are
trying to transfer their tribal bases to urban areas to establish
casinos there. San Diego County has already become a casino capital,
with nine. While the casinos reject all but the most limited
government jurisdiction, including that of law enforcement, they
refuse to accept any responsibility for traffic congestion such as
the 10-mile backup Monday on I-15 outside Temecula.</TE>
<TE>   In fact it probably will take the courts to interpret the murky
language of the compacts and decide to what extent the state can
regulate--and possibly tax--this mushrooming industry. In Nevada and
New Jersey, wide-open gambling, with the constant presence of huge
amounts of cash, requires strict regulation and oversight by state
agencies. That need is just as compelling in California.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Make L.A. a Free Art Zone," editorial, June 22: I heartily
endorse The Times' call for free access to all museums. As the
director of Grand Performances, L.A.'s premier free performing arts
program, I can tell you from our experience that cost--not
upbringing, not socioeconomic class, not education--determines who
will attend all types of performing arts events. Our audiences for
ballet, folk and modern dance, opera and theater, in addition to the
jazz and world music that we present, are filled with people from all
neighborhoods in Southern California. Families from diverse
backgrounds regularly share the joy of discovery when local and
touring artists perform. When that joy is not limited to people of
means, the whole community has the opportunity to see how the
transformative experiences of the arts can serve us all.</LD>
<LD>   But greater numbers of free concerts and more free access to
museums won't take place until Los Angeles changes its attitude
toward public and private philanthropy for the arts. Private-sector
support rests on too few shoulders. We need greater city and county
support. Today, a Los Angeles city resident can expect about $1 per
capita of city and county funds to be provided as arts grants to our
local cultural institutions. A resident of San Diego can expect close
to $8 to be committed, and a resident of San Francisco can expect
more than $12.</LD>
<TE>   Our 16th season began Friday, and I welcome all Southern
Californians to experience Grand Performances' free evening and
weekend concert series in the heart of downtown (at California
Plaza). People need to see for themselves how wonderful it is to
experience the arts in the company of people of all ages from all
parts of Los Angeles. And we all need to realize how important it is
to support efforts to enable even more people to participate, through
free access, in the cultural life of our community.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Alexander</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We live in a low-income neighborhood, and about six months ago I
found some kids in our neighborhood who were interested in art but
had never been to an art museum. So together we planned an outing to
the Museum of Contemporary Art, but when I phoned to find out
admission costs, I had sticker shock. It came out to be big money.
Fortunately, we did find the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena
to be free for kids. While there, one of my young friends fell in
love with the art of India, while the other kids were inspired by the
Pop art exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they will grow into art lovers someday. No, they don't fit
what has come to be L.A.'s usual art-supporting profile: affluent,
privileged and Anglo. But who makes up our community and who must be
the next generation of people to love and support museums in Los
Angeles? Many come from non-English-speaking homes or homes where
there is no art, but many have art lurking in their souls.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is fighting for self-respect. We've had a difficult recent
history. As we see some of our most beloved industries get slammed,
we instead should celebrate and enlarge the growing art community
that has developed here. If we don't encourage our strengths, if we
don't give support and make available experiences that will
strengthen the lives of our kids and their kids, we are doomed to be
a third-rate city.</TE>
<TE>   Making our wonderful museums open to as many people as we can lure
into them can only ensure broad support for art and museums tomorrow.
At the very least, admission must be free for our children.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Markoff Hansen</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "free art zone" urged by your editorial is a laudable idea.
While liberating LACMA we should not, however, forget the L.A. County
Museum of Natural History, where the fees--$8 for adults, $5.50 for
children over 12 and $2 for children 5 to 12--are particularly
onerous because the museum is so oriented toward family attendance.</TE>

Joyner-Kersee makes the typical argument in defense of Title IX: It
was needed and it worked, so it will always be needed and will always
work. She trivializes the fact that the women's Title IX enforcement
brigade has forced the use of quotas through bullying litigation
despite the fact that the law might provide for other ways to satisfy
Title IX participation tests.</LD>
<LD>   In the face of litigation, college (and now high school)
administrators cave in and cancel men's sports, in effect denying
opportunities in many cases to our most at-risk youth: minority
teenage boys. Contrast Joyner-Kersee's denial of objective reality
with Diane Pucin's Sports column on the same day ("Law Did Job, Now
Change It") and one easily recognizes the moral bankruptcy of
Joyner-Kersee's position. Her attempt at political activism falls
short of the mark and injures young minority males in the process.</LD>

<TE>   All this talk about the 30th anniversary of Title IX for women's
sports. Let's see, in 1972 I was a ninth-grade girl. Some of my
"women's libber" friends said, "Hey, let's go out for the boys'
cross-country team!" Four of us joined the team. The coach
good-naturedly let us run the course with the boys but never gave us
one sentence of coaching. Our peers, the boys on the team, gave us
friendly advice, like: "Make sure you close your mouth when you run
or you'll 'strep' your throat [in the cold October air]."</TE>
<TE>   Of course we were not issued uniforms, so we had to wear our PE
outfits to races. These were one-piece shorts sets with our first
names required to be home-embroidered on the front, last names on the
back. I remember my first race: lined up at the start with 50 boys
and the other three girls, poised for the gun. The starting ref
looked at me, looked at my name on my PE uniform and quipped: "Are
you sure you're ready, Kathi?" I don't know about Title IX, but I'm
sure the coaches don't ignore their female athletes anymore, and I
surely hope the refs don't make fun of them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Details Sketchy in Hahn's LAX Modernization Plan," June 23: Mayor
James Hahn's plan is ludicrous. Los Angeles International Airport is
quite efficient for its size. Its U shape allows for convenient
drop-off no matter what the airline and easy transfer between
terminals. Compared with London's Heathrow Airport (the world's
fourth-busiest airport) or New York's Kennedy Airport, (among the
world's busiest), both of which appear to be scattered haphazardly
across the countryside, the world's third-busiest airport--LAX--is
quite user-friendly.</LD>
<LD>   The best course of action for LAX is to leave it alone and do two
other things: First, utilize other regional airports more fully.
London, New York and Chicago, the three regions in the world that
board more passengers per year than the Los Angeles area, all use
multiple airports to handle their air travel needs. Second, build the
California high-speed rail system. Now in the planning stages, the
system would connect San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San
Diego with 200-mph trains.</LD>
<TE>   Making high-speed rail available would sharply reduce the need for
short-haul flights, since high-speed rail is faster than flying for
city-center-to-city-center travel under 500 miles. Short-haul flights
are undesirable because they clog valuable airport terminal space,
pollute heavily per passenger-mile and entail a lot of hassle and
wasted time for a brief journey.</TE>
<TE>   A recent trip to France, on whose rail system California's will be
based, gave me personal experience with the TGV [high-speed train]
service. There is no need to buy a ticket days or weeks in advance,
check in early or endure repeated and intrusive searches. While on
the train one can use one's own cell phone or other electronic device
at any time during the journey. The ride is extremely smooth, quiet
and comfortable, despite speeds up to 186 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Let's try an intelligent alternative to Hahn's plan. LAX isn't
broken and doesn't need fixing.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Ford</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again the city of Los Angeles and Southern California in
general are completely missing the point regarding the modernization
of LAX and planning for the future of air travel in our five-county
region. How smart is it to expand the capacity of a small-acreage
airport surrounded by residential neighborhoods and located in one of
the most traffic-congested areas of the region? How smart is it to
have one international airport to serve five counties? How smart is
it to have 50% of this airport's runway capacity pass over a major
state highway? How smart is it to place the new "safe and secure"
passenger facility between the two flight paths where aircraft pass
on either side at 400 feet and hundreds of miles per hour?</TE>
<TE>   Who are the real stakeholders when it comes to LAX? Are they the
community members who must bear the ever-increasing traffic, noise
and pollution? Are they the people who actually must suffer an even
longer drive through increasing congestion only to endure an even
longer preflight wait created by a remote terminal? Or are the
stakeholders just the Chamber of Commerce members and the downtown
high rollers the mayor seems to love to talk to?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened to the mayor's commitment to a regional solution
to air travel? Why has Hahn not replaced the Los Angeles
representative to the Southern California Regional Airport Authority
when our place in that organization has been vacant since January?</TE>
<TE>   Harry Rose</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Mayor, before you spend millions in proposals for new airport
buildings and roadways at LAX, couldn't you just fix the escalators?
I am a purser for a major airline flying out of LAX. I fly
international flights, and we carry a large suitcase and tote bag on
our four-to-six-day flights. Pursers also carry briefcases. Eighty
percent of the time when we land at LAX, one or more of the
escalators is turned off or broken. We are forced to walk down long
flights of stairs with heavy baggage--an accident waiting to happen.</TE>
<TE>   My airline has four 747s arriving before noon. That means 1,400
passengers and 80 crew members use stairs instead of escalators.
We've been told the Department of Airports is responsible and that it
can't fix the equipment because of two reasons: 1) lack of money and
2) the existing escalators are so obsolete it can't get parts to fix
them. One moving sidewalk in a very long hallway has been out of
service for over six months.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever we complain about the safety issues involved, everyone
simply shrugs his shoulders and says, "There's nothing we can do."
This has been going on for 10 years. Excuse me, but $103 million has
been spent on contracts that have since been abandoned? Elderly
passengers, families with children and flight attendants are using
stairs each day. It's shameful!</TE>

<LD>"Students Reach for High Note" (June 21), on the incredible job that
conductor Christopher Schwabe did for the Santa Monica High School
Symphony students in inspiring them toward their Carnegie Hall
performance, and the subsequent fund-raising work, should really make
the rest of us want to reach into our purses because music programs
in most schools have been cut to the bone.</LD>
<LD>   It's all there for us, folks. The "Mozart effect" theory indicates
that music helps to increase brain power, and now the accomplishments
of these young students are our perfect reward.</LD>
<LD>   Having been personally lucky to observe how others can reach out
in their own way (e.g., Roger Williams, who inspires kids by giving
special concerts and programs to youths in school assemblies; and
David Benoit and the remarkable Asia America Symphony, to name just
two), there's a lot to be said for concerted and dedicated effort.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't take a village, just a little generosity and enthusiasm
from the rest of us to fuel the passions and endow the dreams of
young people so they can focus on their studies and develop their
potential.</TE>

<TE>   Your inspiring story was a day-brightener. Thank goodness there
are still areas of culture in some of our school systems, although
the future, even in Santa Monica, doesn't look too bright. Sports are
great, but how many 70-year-old pros do you see on the soccer,
football and baseball fields or basketball courts? Music is a
lifetime achievement; many of its pros are in their 70s or 80s.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one of those Santa Monica students will make music a
career. But every one of those musicians will remember the hard work
and the euphoric feeling of a concert well done. They will enjoy
classical music all of their lives. Sports are touted as promoting
teamwork, but to play in a band or orchestra is the ultimate in
teamwork.</TE>

<LD>Re "Brothers Die While Diving in Old Mine," June 25: I am a resident
of the canyons. It is sad to hear about the unnecessary death of
anyone, especially brothers so young. The comments from residents,
sheriffs and others speak to the dangers of this abandoned mine or
the tragic loss of life. However, there is no regard for the concept
of personal responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all of the Southwest's ghost towns are riddled with mines
and myriad dangerous conditions. It is not only ignorant to think
that we can protect everyone from themselves but disgusting to
destroy history in the process. I enjoy the dirt trails, the animals
and the trees. The inherent dangers of poison oak, snakes, bobcats
and even abandoned mines are part of the equation. These mines are
historic. They affected the growth of the area, and the trails that
people enjoy are frequently there because of old mining complexes.</LD>
<TE>   There is a sense of wonder that I find in hiking for hours to see
that gaping maw that was the creation of hard work, all to bring out
some silver. Now we have to destroy a landmark like the Blue Light
Mine that is part of Orange County history, all because two
individuals did not realize that a 100-year-old flooded mine shaft
was dangerous? Shall we kill all the rattlesnakes that live in the
hills because someone wearing shorts decides to kick over rocks in
the brush? Shall we fence every divide, every gap that someone could
stumble off wearing flip-flops? I hope that we turn this concept
around. We as people are responsible for ourselves. We cannot protect
everyone from everything.</TE>

<LD>Re "Death Sentences Ruled Up to Juries," June 25: One of the tenets
of our civilized society is that we each give up our individual right
to personally punish a person who has victimized us. Instead we
collectively agree on appropriate penalties for specific crimes. We
then extensively train certain people to enforce the laws.</LD>
<LD>   The police, for instance, are charged with the responsibility of
protecting us. They are licensed to carry guns and to kill, if need
be. They are psychologically indoctrinated with the ability to kill
if the job requires it. The same is true for judges. They are trained
to impose the predetermined penalties for crimes committed. We as a
society have already decided that certain crimes carry the penalty of
death.</LD>
<LD>   Why delegate the responsibility of signing the death warrant to
the weakest, least trained members of the justice system? It is not
fair to the jurors and not fair to us. We, the public, have already
signed that death warrant. The criminal signed his own death warrant
by committing a crime that should end in death. It is ridiculous that
the Supreme Court has given 12 randomly selected people the ability
to override a consensus of all the voters in this country. It is
unfair to every law-abiding citizen of this nation and seriously
undermines the ability of the justice system to carry out its
mission.</LD>

<TE>   Re " ... Fairer Death Sentences," editorial, June 24: The
bleeding-heart liberals at The Times applaud the surprising decision
of a usually sensible Supreme Court to bar the execution of mentally
retarded killers.</TE>
<TE>   Are we to assume these individuals are less dangerous to the
public or to other prisoners than a person of higher intelligence?
This will, of course, lead to an overload of murderers pleading
retardation. Anyone with an IQ you can roll on a pair of dice should
know that.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court is moving in the right direction by limiting the
death penalty. The next step is to abolish it altogether. We must
break our alliance in the death penalty with what President Bush has
called the "axis of evil" and others of similar repressive
governments. Since we failed to lead in abolishing the death penalty,
we should now have the good sense and propriety to follow the
enlightened nations that long ago abandoned this human atrocity that
has demeaned us as a people.</TE>

<LD>In " 'Better Safe Than Sorry' Carries a High Price Tag" (Commentary,
June 21), Henry Miller argues against the "precautionary principle,"
stating that, for instance, many more lives were lost by the banning
of DDT and a consequent spread of malaria than would have been if we
had continued to use DDT as a pesticide.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, by the time Paul Muller, the inventor of DDT, received
the Nobel Prize in 1948 there were already reports of the evolution
of resistance to DDT by houseflies. By 1960, mosquitoes had
effectively evolved a resistance to the chemical. As Stephen Palumbi
reported in an article in the Sept. 7, 2001, issue of the journal
Science, more than 500 species had evolved resistance to at least one
pesticide by 1990.</LD>
<LD>   The idea that the world can be treated categorically, rather than
needing to be taken evolutionarily, is seductive but ultimately more
dangerous by far than the idea Miller makes objection to--the
precautionary principle.</LD>

<TE>   Human history is fraught with problematic episodes of leaping into
things before discovering all the consequences. Although DDT is
effective in stopping the spread of malaria, it is one of the most
deadly chemicals ever to have seen the commercial market. The large
DDT deposit off the Palos Verdes coast necessitates a Superfund
cleanup, has devastated an ecosystem and harmed people eating
contaminated fish. DDT has done similar things elsewhere. Toxic
chemicals don't go away. Following the precautionary principle would
have been handy in the case of nuclear power. The previous generation
has created dependency on a system that produces tons of deadly waste
that outlives us all by tens of thousands of years. The scientific
method only speaks for that which scientists are able to directly and
repeatedly observe. Lack of studies demonstrating harm does not mean
there is no harm occurring.</TE>

<LD>Re "Where's Osama?" letter, June 22: Osama bin Laden is the latest
version of Pancho Villa, a Mexican warlord who invaded the U.S. in
1916. He and his band laid waste to the town of Columbus, N.M.
President Woodrow Wilson sent most of the Army into the mountains of
Mexico to "hunt 'em down and smoke 'em out." Alas, the American armed
forces never found Villa or his band. What they did find was the
aroused population, who fought against the Yankee invaders of their
country.</LD>
<LD>   After three months the Army returned to the U.S. Why not send the
politicians with all their slogans and bombast to hunt for old Osama?
Not safe? Hey, who has ever seen a dead politician on a
battlefield--or even a live one?</LD>

<LD>Two men were charged with capital murder Friday for allegedly
shooting an armored-car guard during a north Long Beach robbery, the
Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Nieves, 20, and Jose Silva, 22, are being held without bail
and are scheduled to be arraigned July 2 in Long Beach Superior
Court.</LD>
<LD>   They are accused of killing 33-year-old Victor Hurtado during a
robbery outside a grocery supply wholesaler at 2300 E. 68th St. in
Long Beach. Hurtado was shot in the head Tuesday as he walked out of
the Jetro Cash and Carry store with a bag of cash. Prosecutors allege
that Nieves fired a handgun as he grabbed the bag from Hurtado, who
was a courier for Sectran Security.</LD>
<TE>   Nieves and Silva were arrested Wednesday when they tried to enter
the United States from Mexico. A U.S. customs agent thought one of
them resembled a photograph police had circulated, said Nancy Tabing,
a spokeswoman for the Long Beach Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they recovered money believed taken in the robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has not decided whether to seek the
death penalty against Nieves and Silva.</TE>

<LD>The Senior Symphony never quit after its last public performance 10
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Its members showed up each week without fail at the Hollywood
musicians union hall to rehearse Brahms and Bach for a next concert
that never seemed to come.</LD>
<LD>   So when the orchestra was offered its first booking since 1992 at
this week's practice, why did the rehearsal threaten to end on a flat
note?</LD>
<TE>   It turns out that the concert invitation that would end the
drought for musicians whose average age is past 70 was for a
nonpaying gig. And this was a union crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "We joined the union to get paid. We don't work for free--we're
professionals," said Phil Gray, a 65-year-old trombone player from
West Hills, as others nodded and murmured in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the "William Tell Overture" score that was spread out
over rehearsal room music stands wasn't the only thing stirring
emotions at the Professional Musicians Local 47 on Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   The 50-piece orchestra is made up of former Big Band-era
performers, retired studio and recording session players and veterans
from philharmonic groups across the country. It was formed in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "So many fine musicians get older and have no place to play," said
orchestra founder Max Herman, a Sherman Oaks trumpet player who turns
88 on Monday. "Some of these people were the top in the business. It
was a thrill to play with them."</TE>
<TE>   Until 1992 the orchestra had a performance venue, the Ambassador
College Auditorium in Pasadena. Herman said an annual concert was
staged there until the college closed.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the players have practiced. And waited patiently to be
asked to again perform in public.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes your blood run faster when you play for an audience,"
said Carla Sobel, 88, a cellist from Los Angeles. "We used to fill
the Ambassador. There wasn't an empty seat. It was great."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra's concert master, violinist Norman Rosenblatt, 86,
of Marina del Rey, agreed. "It's very important to have an audience."</TE>
<TE>   This week's invitation came from the new Hollywood &amp; Highland
shopping and entertainment center, which is planning a series of free
summer concerts. And it came out of the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Chamber of Commerce consultant Laurie Golden heard about
the orchestra while compiling a list of inexpensive summer outings.
She suggested that Hollywood &amp; Highland invite the Senior Symphony.
Center executive LeeAnne Stables quickly agreed to work out the
details.</TE>
<TE>   The invitation delighted union President Hal Espinosa--until he
learned it would be an unpaid performance. Union musicians usually
earn a minimum of $155 for a 2 1/2-hour concert. Performance fees for
the old Ambassador concerts had been financed by a Los Angeles city
grant and a union trust fund.</TE>
<TE>   "But they're so loyal, coming in here every week to rehearse,"
said Espinosa, a trumpet player from Santa Clarita. "We could have
the executive board waive their salary. They could perform as a
community service. It will be up to them."</TE>
<TE>   It fell to union Secretary Serena Kay Williams, a bassist who
lives in Hollywood, to find out if the old-timers were willing to
work for free. She recalled that orchestra trumpet player Victor Zolo
never missed a practice before his recent death at age 101.</TE>
<TE>   "There are others in there in failing health. I'd like for them to
have a concert while they're still around to enjoy it," she whispered
as she opened the thick doors to the rehearsal room.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping onto the conductor's podium, Williams polled the players.
"How important is having a live audience?" she asked. "How important
is a paid concert?"</TE>
<TE>   There was a brief debate among the wind and string sections.
Trombonist Gray and others argued for union principle. French horn
players Warren Stearns, 69, of Frazier Park and Alan Robinson, 72, of
Studio City leaned toward a live crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I donate my time. I don't expect to get paid," said orchestra
co-conductor Newt Guilbeau, 74, a viola player from Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Soon there was a consensus. And violinist Richard Wagner, 78, of
Hollywood, struck the final chord.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just do it for fun," he said.</TE>

<LD>Many conservative protesters at the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops
conference in Dallas this month stood outside in the sweltering heat
and held above their heads a book that revealed exactly what
wickedness led to the church's sex scandal.</LD>
<LD>   They may have even thumped the book a few times, though it wasn't
the Bible.</LD>
<LD>   It was Michael S. Rose's "Goodbye, Good Men: How Liberals Brought
Corruption into the Catholic Church." The well-timed book places the
blame for the sexual abuse of minors by priests and the bishops'
cover-up largely on the liberal teachings of America's seminaries and
the gay subculture he contends it fostered.</LD>
<TE>   Rose, a Catholic journalist, spent two years interviewing 150
people associated with seminaries in the U.S., including bishops,
priests, faculty members and administrators, seminarians and seminary
dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   His unflinching conclusion: There's been a "deliberate
infiltration of Catholic seminaries by ... a clique of homosexual
dilettantes, along with an underground of liberal faculty members
determined to change the doctrines, disciplines and mission of the
Catholic Church from within. Through the seminaries, liberals have
brought a moral meltdown into the Catholic priesthood."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bricks Rose uses to construct his argument are sound
and not disputed by church liberals, conservatives or statistics:</TE>
<TE>   * Between 1966 and 1999, the number of seminarians in high
schools, college and graduate programs dropped from 39,638 to 4,826,
a stunning freefall in candidates for priesthood that endangers the
Catholic Church in America.</TE>
<TE>   * A thriving gay subculture has emerged in the seminaries over the
past few decades--earning them nicknames such as "Notre Flame" (Notre
Dame Seminary in New Orleans), "Theological Closet" (Theological
College at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.) and
"Pink Palace" (St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore--creating an
uncomfortable environment for some heterosexual students.</TE>
<TE>   * And the Catholic sex scandal of the past six months has revealed
a disturbing number of priests and bishops who no longer seek
holiness but pleasures of this world, specifically sex and power.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Rose takes this solid foundation for his book and
builds a house made more of straw than concrete.</TE>
<TE>   One of the book's problems, in both literary and logical terms, is
its anecdotal nature. It's as if the author tried to make sure all
150 of his interviews were squeezed into the book. In Chapter 3, for
instance, Rose managed to wedge the stories of 16 interviewees,
illustrating again and again (and again) his point that orthodox
Catholic students--whom he defines as those supporting Pope John Paul
II and official church teachings--are routinely rejected by liberal
seminaries.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the flurry of anecdotes is like watching cars zoom by on
the freeway: It's difficult to track anything, and you're left with
no lasting details.</TE>
<TE>   The other problem with the anecdotal approach is that it's
impossible to get a sense of how many people these orthodox
men--students, clergy and seminary officials--represent. Rose
contends that militant liberalism and homosexuality within seminaries
have driven away thousands of orthodox students and artificially
created a priest shortage. But that's pure speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Couldn't it also be that Catholic families have gotten
significantly smaller in the past two generations, shrinking the pool
of potential priests? Or that the church's teachings in the 1960s on
birth control and other sexually related issues turned off a
significant number of candidates? Or that the priesthood has simply
fallen out of favor among faithful Catholic parents who once pushed
at least one of their sons toward the vocation?</TE>
<TE>   This is what makes the Catholic Church, at 2,000 years of age, a
wonderfully complex organism. Simple explanations don't fit well. The
dwindling number of clerics isn't due, as Rose argues, to the liberal
establishment's wish to create an artificial shortage that will force
the church to allow married and female priests. Chances are, the
priest shortage has many causes, including liberal theology that
turns off some students and the presence of homosexual majorities at
some seminaries. It is here that Rose's book has value.</TE>
<TE>   The stories told by orthodox students who refuse to accept their
professors' liberal teachings are disturbing. If they devoutly follow
official church teaching--and show devotion to traditional acts of
Catholic piety such as the rosary--they routinely are labeled ""too
rigid," "insubordinate" or "homophobic" and sent to seminary-approved
psychotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "There were psychological screws under which we seminarians were
constantly pressed," said Father John Lewandowski, who attended Mt.
Angel Seminary in Oregon. "The fact was, we had to hide devotion to
Mary and to the Eucharist, or any other pious exercise of faith which
was not on the list of acceptable activities."</TE>
<TE>   If counseling failed, the seminarians in Rose's book said, they
became the subject of witch hunts by faculty members looking for ways
to expel them or keep them from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Said Father John Trigilio of the Harrisburg, Pa., diocese: "The
one book that helped me persevere through 12 years of seminary was
Aleksandr [Solzhenitsyn's] 'Gulag Archipelago.' His imprisonment and
constant surveillance was in many ways identical to my seminary life,
in which cultural revolutionaries sought to 'rehabilitate' the
orthodox into becoming full-fledged party members of the new
dissidence."</TE>
<TE>   Many of these same problem students said they had no trouble once
they switched to a more conservative seminary. Political correctness,
as opposed to rigorous and respectful debate, is appalling in any
academic setting and especially in the seminary, where the PC crowd
is imposing views that amount to heterodoxy.</TE>
<TE>   So what's the response from the accused seminary officials? We
don't know, because Rose doesn't ask them. I'm guessing he sees no
reason to because their actions, especially left unexplained, fit so
neatly into his view that liberals have left the American Catholic
Church in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   It's this vast-left-wing-conspiracy mentality that ultimately
pushes "Goodbye, Good Men"--which does break some ground--into the
margins of ideology. There it will find a welcome home with
conservative protesters and other orthodox Catholics who will take it
as the gospel truth.</TE>

<LD>Olympic gold medalist Paul Gonzalez mistook friendly expressions of
support for political endorsements in the Los Angeles City Council's
14th District race, his campaign admitted Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Neither former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks nor
county Sheriff Lee Baca endorsed Gonzalez, as he said last week.</LD>
<LD>   "While I have great respect for Paul as an Olympian and as a man
dedicated to making the lives of children in his community more
meaningful, I have not endorsed any candidate in the 14th Council
District," Parks said.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalez, 37, is a motivational speaker who teaches boxing at
Hollenbeck Youth Center, where he trained for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   He is mounting his first campaign for public office.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked to both of them personally, and they told him they
support him 100%. He took that as an endorsement," said spokesman
Fred Zermeno.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who won the gold medal in boxing at the 1984 Olympics in
Los Angeles, is one of three men who have filed papers to challenge
Councilman Nick Pacheco for the 14th District seat in March.</TE>
<TE>   Former state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa is also
weighing whether to enter the race.</TE>

<DH>Budget: Senate leader drops plan to increase taxes for the
wealthy. Hike in vehicle and cigarette levies approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In a move that could attract Republican support for a budget
agreement, Democrats have dropped their plan to tax wealthy
Californians to help close a $23.6-billion shortfall and instead
moved Friday to hike vehicle license fees for two years.</LD>
<LD>   In another budget development, state Controller Kathleen Connell
said her office would send out millions in advance payments to
counties for welfare and other social programs, a day after the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis announced it was legally barred
from doing so.</LD>
<LD>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) had threatened to cut
off talks with the administration until funding for the poor resumed.
He said the mix-up appeared to be the result of a failed attempt by
Davis to get a budget approved by applying pressure to Republican
lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   "Anybody with any brains who thinks they can blackmail Republicans
by threatening poor people's money ought to have their heads
examined," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The confusion triggered finger-pointing between Connell and the
Davis administration, which had said it couldn't make the payments
without a budget.</TE>
<TE>   Rita Saenz, director of the California Department of Social
Services, said her office had made the announcement on the basis of
information from Connell's office last week that payments would not
go out to the counties--a point of contention with Connell.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very glad the counties are going to get paid," Saenz said.
"That was always the hope."</TE>
<TE>   Connell's decision to cut the checks means Los Angeles County will
receive about $100 million it was counting on for programs including
CalWORKs, the state's welfare-to-work program.</TE>
<TE>   With one problem out of the way, lawmakers turned their attention
to approving a budget by the start of the new fiscal year on Monday.
In the Capitol, talks Thursday turned to taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said that, while he still favors his proposal to reinstate
higher tax rates for the wealthiest Californians, the plan is not
supported by Davis. Burton indicated he was abandoning the plan,
which failed to receive the single Republican vote it needed to reach
the two-thirds majority required for passage in the Senate earlier
this week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's off the board," Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   A legislative committee negotiating a compromise spending plan
voted Friday to more than double vehicle license fees paid by drivers
for two years, a move that would raise $5 billion. The committee also
voted to increase the 50-cent hike on cigarettes proposed by Davis to
63 cents per pack, starting in August to raise $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actions were taken as Democratic leaders negotiated with Sen.
Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding), whose one vote, when combined with
the upper house's Democratic majority, would allow a budget and
related bills to clear the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Johannessen said earlier this week that he would not support an
increase in income taxes, but that vehicle license fees and sales
taxes remained on the table. A copy of a proposal drawn up by
Democrats to appease Johannessen shows new revenues from tax hikes
and other budget changes at $3.5 billion, around the same level
sought by Davis and about a billion less than Senate Democrats had
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said he was hopeful that the Senate might pass a budget
today, but the possibility of winning approval of the plan in the
Assembly remained clouded.</TE>
<TE>   A standoff continues between Assembly Republicans and Democrats
over a proposal by Davis to shift $1.7 billion in education funding
from the current fiscal year to the next one. In exchange for their
support for the Davis plan, Assembly Republicans want Democrats to
earmark $400 million in funding in the fiscal year that begins July
1, 2003, to equalize spending on rural and urban schools.</TE>
<TE>   For California taxpayers, the game of chicken could result in a
$1.7-billion tax hike. Because the shift involves current-year
spending it would have to be approved by the end of the fiscal year
on Sunday, or risk blowing a $1.7-billion hole in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   As legislative leaders clash over taxes and education funding,
winning passage of a budget may boil down to issues of importance to
just five lawmakers. Approval of the budget requires a two-thirds
vote of the Legislature, which in addition to meaning a single
Republican vote in the Senate means four GOP votes in the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Johannessen, who broke the budget impasse last year
in the Senate, is the man of the moment. Burton said Johannessen is
adamant about certain programs, including money for law enforcement
grants.</TE>
<TE>   In the Assembly, attention is focused on a handful of Republicans
who broke from their caucus last year and voted with Democrats for
the budget. They include David Kelley of Idyllwild, Dick Dickerson of
Redding and Mike Briggs of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   One vote Democrats won't be able to count on this year is that of
GOP Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti of Rancho Cordova, who said he does
not plan to support the budget.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not support any of the taxes," Pescetti said. "I had one
conversation with someone from the governor's office, and I said I
was a no vote."</TE>

<HD>Priest Gets 2 Years for Sex Abuse of Man</HD>
<DH>Sentencing: Father Edward Thomas Burke, now 80, molested a
mentally disabled kitchen worker at a Northern California Jesuit
retreat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>An 80-year-old Roman Catholic priest was sentenced Friday to two years in
state prison for molesting a mentally retarded man at a Jesuit retreat for
a period of several years.</LD>
<LD>   Father Edward Thomas Burke sat motionless as Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Kevin J. Murphy told a hushed courtroom that the
former high school teacher deserved to be punished for "inflicting
severe emotional injury" on his victim, a 51-year-old former kitchen
worker at the retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy alluded to the nationwide sexual abuse scandal dogging the
Catholic Church, saying a lesser term of home detention recommended
by a county probation officer would send the wrong message.</LD>
<TE>   "This was not simply abuse by a caregiver. This was abuse by a
friend," Murphy said. "A parent figure and a spiritual counselor."</TE>
<TE>   The victim's sister, Debra Sullivan, said she was relieved and
happy that Burke would have to spend time in a prison cell. She had
asked Murphy to incarcerate the retired Jesuit for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is right. This is fair," Sullivan said. "I'm so happy that I
can go to my brother and tell him that there is a true consequence
for what Father Burke did. That will be my happiest moment."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Sullivan said her brother was relieved to hear the
news. "I'm glad he got nailed.... I'll sleep in peace tonight," he told
her.</TE>
<TE>   Burke becomes the fifth Jesuit in Northern California in recent
years ordered to register as a sex offender for life. All five of the
Jesuits have resided at Sacred Heart Jesuit Center in Los Gatos, a
picturesque retreat nestled in the foothills above Santa Clara
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Burke pleaded guilty May 23 to committing a lewd act on a
dependent adult, a felony sex crime. The case came to the attention
of law enforcement authorities in March after The Times reported that
top Jesuit officials quietly relocated Burke in April 2000 after he
admitted engaging in sexual misconduct. Instead of notifying
authorities, the Jesuit leaders moved Burke to a residence on the
campus of Santa Clara University.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's hearing, the short, paunchy Jesuit appeared frail and
slightly disoriented as he moved slowly in and out of the courtroom.
Dressed in a faded yellow, short-sleeve sport shirt, light blue
trousers and scruffy tan tennis shoes, Burke stared straight ahead
without expression for most of the nearly four-hour hearing. Wearing
black-rimmed glasses and a hearing aid, he did not speak in court.</TE>
<TE>   After his sentence was announced, Burke was escorted gently by
Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies and booked into county jail. He
will probably be taken by bus to a reception center at San Quentin
Prison, where he will be evaluated by physicians and assigned to a
facility that cares for aged inmates within the California prison
system, said prosecutor Benjamin Field. Field had argued in court
that Burke was better suited for state prison because the Santa Clara
County Jail lacks special facilities for elderly inmates.</TE>
<TE>   With credit for time served, Burke is expected to spend one year
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Burke received a much harsher term than Charles Leonard Connor,
also 80, a Jesuit brother who was sentenced to six months of home
detention in January 2001 for molesting another mentally disabled man
at Sacred Heart. Unlike Burke's case, Connor's received no publicity
and was tried a year before the sexual abuse scandal made headlines
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Field said the media attention in the Burke case "in no way
affected our position on what the sentence should be." He added that
the Burke prosecution justified a tougher sentence because the former
priest allegedly committed sodomy. Burke denied that he had engaged
in any forced penetration with his victim.</TE>
<TE>   Connor and Burke are among four Jesuits named in a lawsuit filed
by attorneys on behalf of the two mentally disabled men who lived and
worked as dishwashers at the Sacred Heart facility. The suit alleges
that the two men were subjected to repeated acts of sodomy,
molestation and false imprisonment for as long as 15 years. The
victims are seeking more than $10 million in damages. Attorneys for
the California Province of the Society of Jesus have been negotiating
a financial settlement for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's sentencing is expected to bolster the victims' civil
litigation, said attorneys representing the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Burke's attorneys appeared stunned by the sentence. The lawyers,
J. Joseph Wall Jr. and Charles W. Hendrickson, had gambled that
Murphy would grant Burke probation without any incarceration in
exchange for submitting a guilty plea at the earliest possible moment
in the legal proceeding. The lawyers had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   During Friday's hearing, the victim's sister and a close friend
delivered emotional testimony urging the judge to put Burke behind
bars.</TE>
<TE>   "If the sentence is a very light one, what kind of message would
that send to other priests who are inclined toward these kind of
corrupt acts?" asked Sullivan, holding back tears.</TE>
<TE>   Holly Ilse, a Los Gatos dress shop owner who befriended the two
mentally retarded men and pushed authorities to investigate the
Jesuits on their behalf, said she was "in disbelief" when she heard
the verdict. "Finally, after five years of hard work, somebody is
going to be held accountable for these absolutely horrific crimes,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense testimony acknowledged that Burke had a parent-child
relationship with his victim and took advantage of a vulnerable
person.</TE>
<TE>   "He described a situation that gradually evolved from hugging to
grabbing [the victim] in the crotch area to masturbating the victim,"
said psychiatrist Douglas M. Harper. He said Burke has a pacemaker,
is on antidepressant medication, suffers from "overwhelming spiritual
guilt" and was nearly suicidal earlier this year. He described the
priest as "nervous, embarrassed, sad ... and remorseful."</TE>
<TE>   Harper testified that he could not fathom how incarceration would
benefit society or the victim. He said Burke posed no danger to his
victim and there is "no possibility" that he would offend again.</TE>

<HD>Officials Say Wildfire in Cajon Pass Is Nearly Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wildfire that burned more than 6,200 acres and razed three homes
and two outbuildings in the Cajon Pass was 80% surrounded Friday and
the prospects for getting it under control were quickly improving,
fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire could be surrounded by 6 p.m. today, said Carol Beckley,
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. She said it was too early
to tell when the fire would be completely put out.</LD>
<LD>   "Currently, the fire is pretty inactive, except for a few hot
spots," Beckley said. The fire, which at one point Wednesday
threatened motorists on Interstate 15 and halted rail traffic,
boasted few visible flames Friday, she said.</LD>
<TE>   Although I-15 had been reopened since Thursday, a portion of
California 138 remained shut down, Beckley said. However, the flames
no longer threatened communities such as nearby Wrightwood, she said.
And residents from sparsely populated Swarthout and Lone Pine canyons
were being allowed to return to about 100 homes.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was apparently started by a roadside car fire Wednesday
afternoon on the shoulder of I-15. The flames damaged major power
lines, temporarily cutting off electricity to about 450,000 customers
in San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, trucks and cars were stranded on I-15--the major
artery between Los Angeles and Las Vegas--as flames roared near the
freeway. Some of the vehicles made U-turns and drove away to escape
the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service used more than 1,400 firefighters, 196 fire
engines, six bulldozers, eight air tankers and 10 water-dropping
helicopters to battle the fire. There were no reported injuries.</TE>

<HD>Polls Show Catholics Back Policy on Abuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A flurry of polls shows general confidence in new sex abuse policies
adopted by the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, but overwhelmingly
strong support for removing bishops who tried to cover up the
scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved a policy June 14
that removes from ministry any priest who has sexually abused a
minor. It does not call for automatic removal from the priesthood,
but that remains an option for an individual bishop to pursue.</LD>
<LD>   Though American Catholics generally support the new policy, 66% of
U.S. Catholics think it does not go far enough, according to a survey
of 1,004 adults by the Washington Post. Eighty-two percent of
Catholics said bishops who tried to cover up the problem should
resign, and 86% said the pope should remove them if they refuse to
resign.</LD>
<TE>   Penalties for bishops found even greater support in a Le Moyne
College/Zogby International poll, which found that 96% of Catholics
want "disciplinary action" against bishops who failed to remove known
abusive priests from their pulpits. Only the pope can remove a bishop
from office. A review panel will name which bishops are in compliance
with the new rules and may use public pressure to seek the removal of
some bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The Le Moyne/Zogby poll found that 79% of Catholics endorsed the
new policy, and 89% agree that abusive priests should be removed from
the priesthood, as well as from public ministry.</TE>
<TE>   A similar USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found slightly more support
for the policy. Fifty-six percent of Catholics approved of the
policy, and 63% said it would be effective. That poll indicated that
90% want bishops who hid the problem to be removed from office.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming majority of Catholics say their faith has not
been tested by the current crisis, although their faith in the
institution has. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found that 22% have
questioned whether they should leave the church because of it.</TE>

<HD>Man Charged in Fatal Immigrant Smuggling</HD>
<DH>Courts: Authorities accuse him of arranging the trip on
Interstate 8 that ended in crash that killed six in the San Diego
area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mexican citizen was charged with immigrant-smuggling Friday,
accused of arranging the deadly van ride in which six people died
after the van crashed into other vehicles Monday night on Interstate
8 east of San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Alfredo Alvarez Coronado was charged in U.S. District Court with
transporting undocumented immigrants for commercial advantage and
financial gain.</LD>
<LD>   He is being held by the U.S. Border Patrol.</LD>
<TE>   According to court papers, Alvarez led several members of the
group on foot through the hills just east of Tecate.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants paid $1,300 to $1,500 each for the trip, of which
Alvarez, who officials believe had been part of a smuggling operation
for about six weeks, kept $300, the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   His job was allegedly to transport the immigrants to another
vehicle that would take them farther into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   While it was driving the wrong way in the eastbound lanes with
headlights off to avoid a nearby Border Patrol checkpoint, the van
struck four oncoming vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the suspected illegal immigrants and a 50-year-old
Albuquerque man were killed instantly. Others suffered injuries that
ranged from minor to severe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's believed that [Alvarez] is only one of several individuals
that work for this organization," said Raleigh Leonard, spokesman for
the Border Patrol's San Diego office.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just an example of the type of callous, ruthless behavior
on the part of smugglers we've been saying from the start has to be
stopped," Leonard said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into the crash continues, and Alvarez could face
more charges, Leonard said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Board Seeks Probe of D.A.'s Office</HD>
<DH>Government: After Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas challenges
supervisors' authority to act on grand jury allegations, they vote
for an outside review.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Friday to hire a private
law firm to examine accusations of cronyism and mismanagement leveled
by the grand jury against Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors had originally intended to review the grand jury
report, weighing in on each of its 92 findings and 42
recommendations. Minutes before the meeting, however, Rackauckas
challenged the board's authority to act on the report.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter faxed to board members, Rackauckas cited the state
penal code, which appears to limit the board's purview to those
matters it holds budgetary responsibility for--a very small portion
of the prosecutor's operation.</LD>
<TE>   "Our office's initial review of the grand jury report has
concluded that only a few of the findings and recommendations fall
within the area applicable to the Board of Supervisors," Rackauckas
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, however, demanded a full review, saying
to do otherwise could expose the board to liability.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Spitzer said the board had a "legal
obligation and a duty to respond to each and every finding and
recommendation in the report."</TE>
<TE>   A slate of law firms without ties to the district attorney's
office must be presented to the board by July 16. Supervisors will
then decide the scope of the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors received the 128-page document Tuesday and
immediately called the special meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The document accuses Rackauckas of intervening in criminal cases
at the request of political supporters, hiring family members of
friends over more qualified candidates and using public resources for
personal business. One of the panel's recommendations is to bar the
district attorney from hiring decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas strongly disputes many characterizations in the report
and promised a lengthy response in the next three months. He said the
report is filled with untrue assertions by longtime political
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Those expecting fireworks at the Friday hearing went away
disappointed. The district attorney didn't attend, and no one on the
board directly addressed the charges Friday.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Friday to hire a private

<LD>   Supervisors had originally intended to review the grand jury

<TE>   Rackauckas strongly disputes many characterizations in the report
and promised a lengthy response in the next three months. He said the

<TE>   Those expecting fireworks at the Friday hearing went away
disappointed. The district attorney didn't attend. Though Spitzer and
Supervisor Tom Wilson had expressed dismay at the allegations
earlier, no one on the board directly addressed the charges Friday.
Most of the few public speakers were longtime Rackauckas critics.
"I'd like to say I told you so, but I won't," government watchdog
Shirley Grindle said. "It's abundantly clear that this board and the
citizens of Orange County have reason to be concerned about the
administration of justice in this county." Grindle, who supported
Rackauckas' challenger in the March election, has routinely accused
the district attorney of moral and ethical lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Another county government watchdog, William Mitchell, said he was
disturbed by the report and the perception that Rackauckas' wife,
Kay, a former deputy prosecutor, had evaded a grand jury subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of what you'd have to do to hide your spouse from a grand
jury civil subpoena," Mitchell said. "What we have here is moral
bankruptcy in the D.A.'s office."</TE>

<HD>Matt Dennis, 89; Singer, Pianist Wrote 'Angel Eyes,' Other
Hits</HD>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Dennis, a singer, pianist and composer who wrote "Angel Eyes"
and a handful of other standards recorded by artists ranging from
Ella Fitzgerald to Willie Nelson, died of natural causes June 21 in a
Riverside hospital. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle-born Dennis, who joined the Horace Heidt Orchestra in
San Francisco in 1933 and sang with singer Alice King, later formed
his own band with Dick Haymes as vocalist, and served as an arranger
and accompanist for Martha Tilton, Margaret Whiting and the Stafford
Sisters.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis scored some of his biggest hits as a songwriter in the
early 1940s while he was a staff arranger and composer with the Tommy
Dorsey Orchestra. In collaboration with lyricist Tom Adair, he wrote
"Everything Happens to Me," "Violets for Your Furs," and "Free for
All," all of which were recorded by Frank Sinatra, then a vocalist
for Dorsey.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis and Adair also wrote "Will You Be Mine?" sung by Connie
Haines; and "Let's Get Away From It All," sung by Sinatra, Jo
Stafford, Haines and the Pied Pipers. Stafford and the Dorsey band
also performed Dennis' "Little Man with a Candy Cigar" (with lyrics
by Frank Kilduff).</TE>
<TE>   In discussing his frequent collaboration with Adair, Dennis told
The Times in 1986 that Adair worked for the water company in Los
Angeles, handling complaints, so they worked a lot over the phone.
"We wrote 'Let's Get Away From It All' over the phone in about an
hour, back and forth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for "Violets For Your Furs" came just as fast, while
Dennis and Adair were listening to Billie Holiday at Mr. Kelley's in
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was winter and the snow was really coming down," Dennis
recalled. "Tom had a date and he bought violets, and Billie was
wearing furs, and we were thinking about what she might sing. Tom
came up with the title, and we scribbled it out, words and music, on
the tablecloth. Sinatra recorded it right away."</TE>
<TE>   Another of Dennis' big hits, "Angel Eyes," took longer to get off
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote it in 1947 and had ... a time getting it going, even with
monumental starts," he recalled. "First, Herb Jeffries did it, but
the [record] company folded. Then Nat Cole did it, and I was in
seventh heaven, but it got lost because it was on the flip side of a
hit called 'Return to Paradise.' Finally, Ella [Fitzgerald] recorded
it for [producer] Norman Granz. She's done it four times since. I'm
thrilled because she's always included it in her shows."</TE>
<TE>   In the late '40s, Dennis was signed by Capitol Records to record
several singles backed by the Paul Weston Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   A popular singer and jazz pianist in the '40s, '50s and '60s in
Los Angeles area clubs and restaurants such as the Encore, the
Tally-Ho and the Lighthouse, Dennis had his own local TV shows on
KTTV and KHJ in the early 1950s, and in 1955 was a summer replacement
for Eddie Fisher on NBC-TV with "The Matt Dennis Show."</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Dennis served as a singer-vocalist and
arranger for the U.S. Army Air Forces' Radio Production Unit and
played with the Glenn Miller Air Force Band after it returned from
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, former big band singer Ginny Maxey
Dennis; three children, David of New Orleans, Julie of Riverside and
Matthew of Eureka; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held in about month.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Orders DWP to Probe Power Deals</HD>
<DH>Energy: Mayor wants an investigation of whether utility
used 'ricochets' to elevate prices. General manager pledges to update
officials Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn called on the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power on Friday to investigate allegations that the city-owned
utility had engaged in power-trading deals aimed at elevating prices.</LD>
<LD>   Saying he was disturbed by evidence uncovered by state Senate
investigators this week, the mayor directed DWP's general manager,
David Wiggs, to immediately launch a thorough investigation of
whether the utility had engaged in schemes dubbed "ricochets" by
power traders.</LD>
<LD>   Wiggs, who was not in charge of the city-owned utility during the
electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, said the agency would begin
interviewing all energy traders and give DWP commissioners an update
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Touted during California's electricity crisis as a better, more
reliable supplier of power than private enterprise, the DWP now finds
its image tarnished by the same charges of greed and gaming that have
dogged private energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento Thursday, DWP officials denied that they had engaged
in daisy-chain trades that match a scheme called a ricochet by Enron
Corp. traders. Also known as megawatt laundering, a ricochet involves
shuttling electricity out of the state, then bringing it back for
sale to California grid operators at higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   Some city officials defended the utility Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the agency that kept California running during the energy
crisis," said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who heads the council's
Commerce, Energy and Resources Committee. "It's kind of painful to
have them turn around and say, 'You guys are the bad guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials swore to state and federal investigators last month
that they had not engaged in such transactions in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But a Senate committee that has been investigating manipulation of
California's electricity market for the last year collected e-mails
and phone transcripts that detail a seven-step deal on Nov. 12, 2000,
that was halted after one hour by the California Independent System
Operator because it was, Cal-ISO officials said, a "ricochet" that
violated their rules.</TE>
<TE>   In that incident, power sold to the DWP for $70 per megawatt-hour
was shipped to the Oregon border and back again and eventually sold
to Cal-ISO, which manages much of the state's transmission grid, for
$250 per megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   DWP's power trading supervisor, Mark Ward, testified to lawmakers
Thursday that the deal had not been designed to raise prices or to
skirt federal price caps in California.</TE>
<TE>   The utility earned only $1,250 in transmission fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the DWP's power trading
practices further in future hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation revives questions about whether DWP profited
from the meltdown of California's electricity market at the expense
of the customers served by other utilities. Those familiar with
California's now defunct power market note that in 2000 and 2001, the
DWP often delivered power that helped the state avoid blackouts--but
usually in the late afternoon, as demand and prices peaked.</TE>
<TE>   S. David Freeman, DWP general manager at the time, said he told
his traders to sell power at 15% above cost. An audit produced by DWP
after Freeman resigned in the spring of 2001 found that the company
had earned an average 56% profit on its sales to the California power
market, although the DWP could have earned more money than it sought,
under market bidding rules.</TE>
<TE>   Charges of gouging by the DWP dogged former Mayor Richard Riordan
in his failed race for governor this year, and now the allegations of
a ricochet scheme have delayed Freeman's appointment to the state's
new public power authority.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) put off a
vote to confirm Freeman until lawmakers could learn more about the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP commission's vice president, Dominick W. Rubalcava, said
Sacramento politicians are looking for a scapegoat.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are running state government are embarrassed, and
they're being scrutinized," he said. "So what's the best defense?
Point the finger at somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   The agency, he said, "has probably taken hits because it has
conducted itself as a business operating in the private sector, as
opposed to a government agency. Had we been conducting ourselves as a
government agency, we would have been short of power."</TE>
<TE>   As a publicly owned utility, the DWP chose to watch from the
sidelines in 1998 as California lifted regulation from its private
utilities and launched the nation's most extensive deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   As the market created under that plan imploded, the customers of
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison suffered rate
hikes and blackouts, while DWP customers enjoyed stable prices and
abundant supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "There are way too many people in the state of California who find
L.A. bashing a good sport, and DWP is getting a certain amount of
that," Galanter said. "This department is actually doing a wonderful
job at everything but its publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who sits on the Senate
committee investigating the DWP and many other participants in the
electricity market, said, "I don't have an indictment in my back
pocket in any sense." But a growing body of evidence indicates that
power traders used publicly owned transmission lines to avoid
scrutiny by Cal-ISO.</TE>
<TE>   The latest allegations against the DWP once again raise the issue
of how a municipal utility ought to weigh its obligation to keep
costs low for its customers against the good of the state at large.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a public enterprise providing a service that a private
enterprise provides in other places," said Steven Erie, a UC San
Diego political science professor who is writing a book about the
DWP. "They have to act like a business."</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether a ricochet goes too far," he said. "Let's
wait until the evidence is in."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss said it would be "inexcusable" for the
DWP to have overcharged or gamed the electricity market at the
expense of utility customers elsewhere in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the city of Los Angeles has its own power source, we are
inextricably intertwined with the state of California," he said. "'I
don't view the relationship between the city and state as us versus
them. We're all in it together."</TE>

<HD>Falwell Hopes to Give New Meaning to 'God's Country'</HD>
<DH>Land use: Conservative pastor envisions cradle-to-grave
services in a master-planned Christian community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LYNCHBURG, Va.</DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jerry Falwell pulls the wheel hard right, sweat budding
across his cheeks as he guides the Chevy Suburban around potholes in
the dirt road.</LD>
<LD>   It's a rough drive to the mountaintop overlooking his 4,300-acre
property. But the view, he promises, is worth the trip.</LD>
<LD>   Sprawled below is the red brick of Liberty University and his
beloved Thomas Road Baptist Church. Now imagine golf courses,
recreation centers, apartment complexes, he says. Maybe a ski lift up
the mountain; maybe one of those revolving restaurants on top.</LD>
<TE>   At 68, Falwell thinks often about what will remain when he's gone.
If he gets his way in federal court this summer, the conservative
pastor will leave his most visible legacy twinkling below--a
master-planned Christian community where members of his flock can
live from "birth to antiquity."</TE>
<TE>   "You'll never have to leave this place," Falwell says. "You can
come in at age 2, in our early learning center ... age 5 into our
kindergarten, age 6 through 18 in our elementary and high school.
Then on to Liberty University for four years."</TE>
<TE>   For fun, local kids can already go to Falwell's Camp Hydaway
summer camp. If residents develop a substance-abuse problem, there's
his Elim Home for Alcohol and Drug-Addicted Men. If a woman has an
unwanted pregnancy, she can go to the Liberty Godparent Home for
Unwed Mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Falwell followers ages 55 or older soon will be eligible to move
nearby into Liberty Village, a 1,135-unit retirement center with its
own markets, putting green, chapel and associate pastor from
Falwell's church. The retirement condos, which run from $100,000 to
$300,000, are under construction just outside Lynchburg.</TE>
<TE>   Taking off his glasses, Falwell pauses to dispel what he already
expects to be misinterpretations of his dream.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intentions of building a 'compound'--no wall is going
to go up," he says. "If a non-Christian family applied, they would be
accepted."</TE>
<TE>   How about homosexual couples?</TE>
<TE>   "That wouldn't work," Falwell says with a chuckle. While he can't
legally bar anyone from living in his community, "they wouldn't be
comfortable here--all these Christians would be witnessing to them."</TE>
<TE>   Already, Falwell has built much of his community and employs about
2,000 people--more than the city government of Lynchburg. With
donations now picking up since Sept. 11, he'll break ground on the
putting green and recreation center this summer.</TE>
<TE>   What's missing right now is the spiritual--and legal--connection
to Thomas Road Baptist Church. Virginia's Constitution prohibits
churches from owning more than 15 acres of land within a city and
holding a corporate charter. Since the 1950s, the restrictions have
forced Falwell to keep his church legally separate from the ministry
and its related operations under a handful of separate corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the entire ministry under one board of deacons would
simplify things, Falwell says, and it also would give him peace of
mind that his ministry won't fall apart after he's gone.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I'm living, it makes no difference. But there will be
another pastor one day," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Falwell grew up just a few miles away with his twin brother. As he
became a voice for religious conservatives, he accumulated tracts of
land surrounding his church.</TE>
<TE>   Since his Moral Majority folded in 1989, close associates say
Falwell has increasingly focused attention here in central Virginia,
consolidating his ministry and making good on an early dream to build
a community for his followers.</TE>
<TE>   Falwell successfully sued in federal court this year to force the
state corporation commission to grant Thomas Road a charter, a
preliminary step to consolidating his entire ministry. A federal
judge is expected to rule on the land limitation sometime this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   If he prevails, Falwell envisions a community where his schools,
neighborhoods and recreation facilities are all legally tied to
Thomas Road. And the church would begin construction on a 12,000-seat
auditorium next to the university.</TE>
<TE>   The first residents will move into Liberty Village by August, and
the entire community is expected to be complete in a few years.</TE>

<HD>Christian Films Target Mainstream</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Movies with a moral message try to break out
of the bush leagues with upcoming productions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE RABEY</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In recent years, Christian authors and musicians have enjoyed
major-league hits with books and albums that have broken out of
evangelical retail channels to achieve a wider success.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to movies, though, Christian films have remained a
bush-league operation, known for low-budget, limited-release
productions like last year's "Left Behind: The Movie," and this
year's "Joshua." Both were critically panned and failed to connect
with mainstream viewers.</LD>
<LD>   But all that may be changing.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, "Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie," the first feature-length
project from the makers of the best-selling "Veggie Tales" children's
videos, will make Christian movie history by opening on more than
1,000 screens nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   And early next year, viewers will get a chance to see "Hangman's
Curse," based on a youth-oriented suspense novel written by
best-selling Christian author Frank Peretti.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been zillions of Christian movies, and they have all
been terrible," said Peretti, who has been visiting the Spokane,
Wash., set where his book is being turned into a film.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, Christians have had a really strong bias against
films and Hollywood. And when they have tried to make movies, these
have been more like evangelistic tracts than the kinds of things
people want to spend their money to go see."</TE>
<TE>   Christian films have largely been made by Hollywood outsiders,
some of whom claim their distance from mainstream pop culture helps
keep them pure from its corrosive effects.</TE>
<TE>   But the people producing "Hangman's Curse," a mystery film with
spiritual elements about the unintended consequences of teenage
cruelty, are entertainment industry veterans. All are more intent on
telling a good story well than on securing viewers' salvation as the
final credits roll.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to produce family-based, morally based entertainment
that is on par with what secular audiences are used to seeing," said
Joe Goodman, co-owner of Namesake Entertainment in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   Namesake, which has produced TV films for the Disney Channel and
USA Network, had its feature film baptism by fire with "Left Behind:
The Movie," a project co-produced with Cloud Ten Pictures, a Canadian
company.</TE>
<TE>   That film generated more media coverage for its contentious
off-stage disagreements and an ongoing lawsuit than for anything
appearing on screen.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great step in the process for us," said Goodman,
struggling to put a positive face on a project he would rather
forget.</TE>
<TE>   For "Hangman's Curse," Goodman and Namesake partner Bobby Neutz,
who met at Southeast Christian Church in Louisville, recruited
veteran actors, including David Keith ("An Officer and a Gentleman,"
"Behind Enemy Lines") and Mel Harris (TV's "thirtysomething").</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, their co-producer is Ralph Winter, who shared
production duties on five of the "Star Trek" films and "Planet of the
Apes" and is currently in Vancouver, Canada, helping produce "X-Men
II," a sequel to the recent Hollywood blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we will not make a 'Christian movie,' " Winter said. "Our
intent with 'Hangman's Curse' is not to have an agenda or to push
something on people. It's to make a movie that tells a good story and
does justice to Frank Peretti's novel.</TE>
<TE>   "Once Christians stop making movies with agendas, they will start
reaching audiences outside the middle-class, churchgoing,
well-behaved crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Namesake did not conduct litmus tests to ensure that others
working on the project share its faith commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Director Rafael Zelinsky, who was born to Roman Catholic parents
in Poland, now says he has "open horizons" about matters of
spirituality. "All religions at their core speak the same language,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Zelinsky is pleased to have a role in the continuing
evolution of Christian filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "When people try to preach through films, it takes people out of
the experience," he said. "But if Christian films are more universal
in their appeal, they will attract people of other religions."</TE>
<TE>   Produced on a budget of $2 million, "Hangman's Curse" won't
contain the high-tech Hollywood thrills and chills of "X-Men II,"
which will cost more than 50 times as much to make.</TE>
<TE>   But after the first few days of shooting on "Hangman's Curse,"
Goodman is hopeful about the movie, which is expected to have at
least a limited theatrical release early next year.</TE>
<TE>   And he thinks the project is a step in the right direction for
Christian filmmakers as they work hard to transcend failures of the
past and press on to a brighter and possibly more star-studded
cinematic future.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing the best we can to learn from the past and to work
with a talented group of people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, the proof will be in the final product.
Hopefully, we will make a good film and things will begin to turn
around."</TE>

<HD>Fireworks Sales Begin With Bang</HD>
<DH>Fillmore: Despite the high danger of brush fires, dozens of
customers flock to the only city in Ventura County where the items
can be legally bought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Caraveo knows fireworks can be dangerous--he nearly blew off
his hand while playing with illegal firecrackers as a teenager.</LD>
<LD>   But that painful memory didn't deter the 29-year-old Encino
resident from making the nearly 45-mile drive to Fillmore on Friday
afternoon to legally purchase fireworks for his Fourth of July
celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "This year, more than anything, this is for my 2-year-old," he
said. "Seeing his eyes light up. That's my celebration."</LD>
<TE>   Buying fireworks is illegal everywhere in Ventura County except in
this rural city, which on the first day of sales attracted dozens of
out-of-towners who spent hundreds of dollars to purchase Piccolo
Petes, Killer Bees, sparklers and smoke bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Dry conditions have made this one of the worst fire seasons in
years, and officials worry that a stray spark even from so-called
safe and sane fireworks could cause a major brush fire, such as the
Wolf blaze, which burned nearly 23,000 acres in Los Padres National
Forest earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   County fire officials asked Fillmore to suspend firework sales
this year in light of the added danger. The City Council denied the
request, saying the sales discourage the use of illegal
fireworks--those that lift in the air or explode and which are most
likely to cause a fire."It's a pretty unpopular idea" to eliminate
firework sales, said Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren. Though he
personally would support a temporary ban, he said his job is to
follow the wishes of the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, people think it's a God-given right to set off
fireworks," Askren said of the sales, which began at noon Friday. "I
just hope and pray that it doesn't cause injury to someone. And that
people use common sense."Fireworks sales are the biggest source of
income for the 26 charities, churches and nonprofit groups operating
booths in Fillmore, said Barbara Workman of the Fillmore Women's
Service Club, who worked at her group's stand on California 126. Last
year, these groups made profits of nearly $450,000 from fireworks
sales.</TE>
<TE>   With most groups on Friday raking in upward of $60 per purchase,
it's unlikely an alternate fund-raiser would generate as much
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Most fires are started by illegal fireworks, and you can't stop
people from using those," Workman said. "I don't think we should be
penalized because of the few who misuse fireworks. The whole town
depends on this."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to find anyone in Fillmore who supports a fireworks
ban. Any concern about a potential brush fire is outweighed by the
local charities' need for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Caraveo thinks a ban would be ineffective. "Every year, I have to
go farther and farther to get the safe and sane fireworks," he
said.It's easy to purchase illegal fireworks, but "at least this
gives people the chance to obey the law," said Dwight Magness, who
was helping out at the Fillmore Women's Service Club stand.</TE>
<TE>   But just taking the fireworks outside the city limits is breaking
the law. And several customers on Friday admitted that is what they
intended to do.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley resident Alberto Suarez perused the selection of
fireworks at one booth, searching for something suitably "loud" for
his children. Though signs warned customers that fireworks are
illegal outside Fillmore, Suarez shrugged. "If they bust me, they
bust me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other customers scoffed at the idea that safe and sane fireworks
might contribute to or cause a brush fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I could care less about the danger," said Casey Scorza, 17, of
Santa Clarita. He said his father's house burned down in a wildfire
last August, but that hasn't dampened his desire to set off fireworks
this year.</TE>
<TE>   While he said he understands concerns about irresponsible
fireworks use, he doesn't think he should have to sacrifice his
Independence Day fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Why worry about it?" agreed his companion, 16-year-old Heinrich
Hindler of Santa Clarita, who spent about $60 Friday. "There are
dangers everywhere--I don't know why they focus on fireworks."</TE>
<TE>   Farther up the road, Zack Mena, 15, and Paul Sexton, 16, drove in
from Acton to purchase nearly $100 worth of fireworks that they
planned to set off in the desert. Mena said the state-approved
fireworks the pair bought in Fillmore could better be described as
"safe and lame," but that they would be "kind of fun to throw at each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Those running the booths say they can't guarantee customers will
use the fireworks properly, though they hand out fliers urging safe
and legal use. And each booth must pass safety inspections by the
fire marshal.</TE>
<TE>   "It almost sounds cold, but what more can you do?" wonders David
Pele, president of Maranatha Fellowship church, which operates a
booth along a shady patch up the road from most of the other
fireworks stands. "You're selling a product that you know is illegal
[outside Fillmore]. We do know a lot of fireworks don't stay here.
But people are going to do what they want."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Fire Department officials recently produced fliers
to remind residents there is "zero tolerance" for fireworks outside
Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want people not to celebrate," said Ventura County Fire
Department spokesman Joe Luna. "But there are many ways to celebrate
the Fourth of July without fireworks."</TE>
<TE>   Luna warned that people can be fined if they are caught with
fireworks, and can be held liable for any damage those fireworks
cause. The county Fire Department has also activated citizen patrols
that will report suspicious fire activity. The volunteers will not
attempt to enforce any laws, but rather will be on the lookout for
any firework activity in fire-prone areas such as Thousand Oaks, Simi
Valley and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   But Fillmore resident Jimena Sanchez, 20, was skeptical about the
effectiveness of such patrols. She knows too many people who sell
illegal fireworks on the street. "I've been hearing people using them
for the last few weeks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But a fireworks ban isn't the solution, Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fireworks are what make Fillmore special--it's the only town that
really has a good Fourth of July," she said. "It shows our spirit,
and it would be kind of sad and lonely without it."</TE>

<HD>Galanter to Open Valley Offices</HD>
<DH>Politics: Councilwoman says constituents in her redrawn

<LD>City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter announced plans Friday to open two
field offices in the San Fernando Valley in early July to serve
residents in her newly redrawn council district.</LD>
<LD>   "My new constituents may not have elected me, but they will be
getting an unparalleled level of service," she said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   To create another Valley district, the council moved the 6th
District, which consisted of parts of West Los Angeles, Venice and
Crenshaw, to the East Valley. Galanter, who has represented the
Westside for 15 years, will start work in her new district in July.</LD>
<TE>   The two offices, one in Van Nuys City Hall and the other at 8135
San Fernando Road in Sun Valley, will open in early July, said Leah
Wyman, Galanter's press deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Galanter announced her Valley staff.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief of Staff Mike Bonin will serve as her district
director and Senior District Deputy Audrey King will work on
community development issues and special projects.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Daley will represent the councilwoman in the west Van Nuys,
Lake Balboa and Sepulveda Basin areas; Maricela Gomez will represent
her in east Van Nuys, Panorama City and Arleta; Peter Brown will
represent her in Sun Valley, Pacoima and northeast North Hollywood;
and Mario Juravich will work out of Galanter's office in City Hall
and handle district planning issues.</TE>

<HD>City Compromises on Street Improvements</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Council approves amended $14-million
project to ease traffic on Glendale Boulevard. Residents back plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a year of dispute, a compromise has been reached on
some portions of a $14-million project to ease traffic on Glendale
Boulevard, a major thoroughfare into downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Some residents in Echo Park objected to the proposed permanent
closing of Berkeley Avenue at Glendale and street widening at
Glendale and Temple Street, which would endanger some popular tennis
courts on the northeastern corner of the intersection.</LD>
<LD>   Now, thanks to suggestions by Los Angeles traffic engineers,
compromises have been reached with residents to move the project
along. The City Council has approved the amended plans.</LD>
<TE>   "We're happy with this," said Judy Raskin, an Echo Park resident
who served on a citizens panel that has studied Glendale's traffic
problems for nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   For years, city officials and area residents have been grappling
with how best to deal with rush-hour traffic that routinely clogs a
two-mile stretch of Glendale; an estimated 30,000 commuters use the
boulevard to and from Los Angeles daily. The Glendale Freeway empties
directly onto the boulevard two miles north of downtown, further
compounding traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic also backs up on Alvarado Street, which feeds into
Glendale at the intersection with Berkeley in Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   On June 15 of last year, Eric Garcetti's first day as the newly
elected councilman for parts of Echo Park, the council was scheduled
to approve the Glendale corridor plan. But protests over the proposed
closure of Berkeley and the widening at Glendale and Temple prompted
Garcetti to seek a delay. He asked residents and city traffic
engineers to discuss remedies.</TE>
<TE>   "After a lot of prodding from us, the Department of Transportation
started to think outside of the box with the problems that we had,"
Raskin said.</TE>
<TE>   The result of the yearlong talks were solutions that quickly
gained community support:</TE>
<TE>   * Berkeley will be kept open at Glendale, allowing access to
neighborhoods adjoining the street.</TE>
<TE>   * Southbound left turns from Glendale onto Berkeley will be
prohibited on most days, eliminating a cycle of lights at the
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   * Northbound traffic from Glendale, at the intersection with
Berkeley and Alvarado, can proceed through on Alvarado, which trails
into a hilly neighborhood on the east side of Glendale. But return
traffic on Alvarado can no longer enter the intersection, thus doing
away with another cycle of signals there. Traffic will be rerouted to
Berkeley to proceed south on either Glendale or Alvarado.</TE>
<TE>   * A traffic signal will be installed at Glendale and Aaron Street,
just north of the Glendale-Alvarado-Berkeley intersection, to slow
the traffic flow in the area.</TE>
<TE>   To discourage commuters from cutting through residential streets
to get to Glendale, an eastbound left-turn light will be installed on
Sunset at Alvarado.</TE>
<TE>   These and previously approved measures should help ease congestion
on Glendale, Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic not just because of the process but [because] of the
solutions reached," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Farhad Zaltash, the city's project manager, added: "It was very
frustrating, but we learned a lot. Eventually, we came up with a
solution that the community likes and one that we can live with."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, talks are continuing between Echo Park residents and
planners at Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
over a project to restructure the Glendale Freeway's terminus at
Glendale Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Residents hope state transportation officials will agree to remake
the terminus to create about five acres of park land near the Tommy
Lasorda baseball field, which is just west of the freeway's end.</TE>
<TE>   Landscaping, more traffic signals and other improvements also are
being studied to ease traffic along that segment of Glendale
Boulevard.</TE>

<HD>Stalking Charges Filed</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Los Angeles County Grand Jury member is accused
of following a fellow juror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County civil grand juror has been charged with stalking
another grand juror, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   James Bernard Avery, 63, is also charged with making criminal
threats against fellow grand juror Tammi Sharp. He pleaded not guilty
to the felony charges on Thursday and is scheduled to appear in
Superior Court on Monday, when a date is to be set for his
preliminary hearing, district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons
said.</LD>
<LD>   He is being held in County Jail on $1 million bail.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Avery began "willfully, maliciously and
repeatedly" following and harassing the victim on May 1, according to
a felony complaint for an arrest warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp reported the incidents to court officials, who referred the
case to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Avery was arrested June 21, and was released from custody on
$150,000 bail, sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, he continued the stalking, prosecutors allege.
At one point, deputies believe he called Sharp, who is 37 and
married, and told her to drop the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors filed additional charges of stalking, making criminal
threats and dissuading a witness by force or threat. Sheriff's
deputies rearrested Avery on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "My belief is that Mr. Avery is obsessed with Ms. Sharp, based on
the volume of e-mails, letters and uninvited appearances at her
house," said Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Conley.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp told sheriff's officials that on Thursday night, she was
going to a store in Bellflower when two men in their 40s approached
her and indicated they were police officers. Conley said the men then
allegedly assaulted her, and she "was bruised up pretty badly."
Conley said the men told her that if she did not drop the charges
against Avery, "this is just the beginning of what's going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   The men have not been identified, and there have been no arrests
in that incident.</TE>

<DH>Policy: Greek Orthodox clergy-laity congress opens Sunday
amid debate over how U.S. bishops will be chosen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Greek Orthodox Church opens its 36th national clergy-laity
congress here Sunday amid stirrings of discontent that many hoped had
been put to rest with the ouster of the church's controversial
archbishop three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The issue this time is not the American church's new archbishop,
His Eminence Demetrios, who is generally well regarded, but a
controversial new church charter. Some church activists are warning
that the charter not only erodes rank-and-file power, but further
delays the 1.5-million-member American church's eventual independence
from its mother church, headquartered in Istanbul, Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy is a classic example of a church built by
immigrants, who have come of age in America, intent on remaining
loyal to the church's ancient Greek traditions and faith, even as
that church is reshaped by a new culture.</LD>
<TE>   Orthodox churches in America, such as the Greek, Russian and
Antiochian churches, have a combined total of 5 million to 6 million
active members. These groups represent the Eastern expression of
Christianity, with its elaborate rituals and crown-bedecked bishops.
Roman Catholic, Anglican and Protestant churches comprise the more
dominant Western expression of the faith. The tension over how
autonomous the U.S. Greek Orthodox Church should be in administering
its affairs comes less than a month after the Antiochian Orthodox
Christian Archdiocese of North America, with 500,000 members in the
U.S. and Canada, was granted autonomy by its mother church in
Damascus, Syria.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the clergy-laity congress opens with a Divine Liturgy
at the Los Angeles Convention Center on Sunday, tensions have been
apparent. There is not even agreement on whether the new charter is
subject to a vote when the business sessions begin Monday at the
Bonaventure Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   His Eminence Metropolitan Anthony, bishop of the church's
seven-state Greek Orthodox Diocese of San Francisco, said he hopes
the charter will be discussed in a civil manner, but that he does not
expect a vote. The charter has already been approved by the U.S.
metropolitan bishops, Archbishop Demetrios, and the ecumenical
patriarch in Istanbul, His All Holiness Bartholomew I.</TE>
<TE>   However, an activist group, Orthodox Christian Laity, claimed that
failing to put the new charter to a vote would violate the 1977
charter--and erode the laity's historically prominent role in church
affairs. "It needs to come before the congress for discussion and, we
think, a vote," George Matsoukas, the group's executive director said
in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Controversy</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the executive committee of an influential
fund-raising group within the church, Leadership 100, declared in a
vote that the charter was "unacceptable." A day later the committee
withdrew its criticism, according to The National Herald, a
Greek-American newspaper. An immediate issue in the new charter is
how U.S. bishops are chosen. The question is connected to how much
autonomy the U.S. church has in running its affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The church was thrown into turmoil three years ago when the
ecumenical patriarchate, the church's historic headquarters, named
Archbishop Spyridon to lead the U.S. church.</TE>
<TE>   Spyridon, although born in the U.S., mostly lived outside the
country. His autocratic management style and his failure, at times,
to consult his U.S. bishops created opposition and led to calls
within the U.S. church to declare independence from Istanbul.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a revolt by his richest and most important church,
Patriarch Bartholomew removed Spyridon in August 1999 and appointed
Archbishop Demetrios in his place.</TE>
<TE>   While Demetrios is generally well liked, some reformers in the
U.S. church want a greater voice in how the American archbishop is
chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new charter, worked out during four meetings this year
in Istanbul between the U.S. metropolitan bishops and Bartholomew and
his leading clerics, any new U.S. archbishop must be knowledgeable
about the U.S. church, speak English and have served in the United
States. But he is still appointed by the ecumenical patriarchate. A
proposal from the U.S. metropolitan bishops that any American
archbishop be chosen by the patriarchate from a list of three names
submitted by the U.S. church was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. metropolitan bishops in the rung below the archbishop would
be selected by the ecumenical patriarchate from a list of three who
received the most votes in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Orthodox Christian Laity want all U.S. metropolitan
bishops elected by Americans without involvement by the ecumenical
patriarchate. They also want to limit the ecumenical patriarchate
choosing an archbishop from among three names submitted by the U.S.
church.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that U.S. bishops have been elevated to the status of
"metropolitans" and report directly to the patriarchate in Istanbul
instead of to the U.S. archbishop also grates on some who call for a
more-independent church.</TE>
<TE>   Critic Sees 'Takeover'</TE>
<TE>   "This idea of fragmenting all the [U.S.] dioceses into their own
fiefdoms is an effort to make autonomy more difficult," said
Christian Laity head Matsoukas. "It's a takeover by the patriarchate,
which is losing its congregation in Istanbul. He's trying to use the
American church power base because he's losing his own power base."</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan Anthony disagrees. "As far as the issue of our
elevation, now becoming little papacies here and there, nonsense,"
Anthony said. "We were the last bishops in the Orthodox world that
did not have the title of 'metropolitan.' "</TE>
<TE>   He said the title gives him the opportunity to have assistant
bishops in his seven-state diocese. But he rejected charges that the
Orthodox church is adopting a hierarchal "Roman Catholic" model of
governance.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony accused critics of playing "political football." He said
the American church is as autonomous as it can be--and more
autonomous than some churches elsewhere in the world under the
ecumenical patriarchate's authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has interfered with my work and my ministry here in this
diocese, including the archbishop in New York, the synod in
Constantinople. The ecumenical patriarch cannot visit me without my
expressed [approval]. If that's not autonomy, I don't know what is,"
Anthony said.</TE>

<HD>Teens Get Jail for Hate-Crime Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In an emotional case involving allegations of racism and class
prejudice, four Anglo teenagers from an upscale neighborhood were
sentenced to jail Friday for an unprovoked hate-crime attack on five
elderly Mexican laborers.</LD>
<LD>   The teens, their families and their lawyers had begged for
leniency while migrant-rights groups demanded stiff sentences as a
warning to others who might prey on migrants.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge James Milliken handed out sentences ranging
from 120 days in a youth camp to 90 days in an adult prison. Four
other teens will be sentenced next month.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that this behavior is possible is a sad commentary on
the community," said Milliken. "I, for one, feel we have to tell the
community that we are not going to put up with it."</TE>
<TE>   Milliken sentenced Morgan Victor Manduley, 17, to 120 days in a
youth camp after declaring he was the "least culpable." Jason Wayne
Beever, 16, was given 180 days in a youth camp. Both cried during the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged ringleaders of the attack--Adam Mitchell Ketsdever,
18, and Bradly Hunter Davidofsky, 17--were sent to state prison for
90 days. After that, Milliken said, he will reevaluate the cases and
determine whether they should spend additional time behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Ketsdever apologized to the victims: "I am truly sorry for what
I've done and I hope that some day I might make it up to you and your
families."</TE>
<TE>   Beever's mother sobbed as he was led away in handcuffs. He looked
at his mother and mouthed the words "I love you."</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers, after using a racial epithet to describe their
victims, according to several of the targets of the assault, attacked
the occupants of a makeshift camp east of Del Mar on July 5, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   That language was the basis for the hate-crime charge.</TE>
<TE>   The victims, in their 60s and 70s, were beaten with clubs and
metal rods and shot with a pellet gun as the teens laughed and
shouted racial slurs. The victims were robbed of $2 during the
attack.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers swept down on their victims in a car without
warning. The victims, all longtime employees of a nursery in Del Mar,
lived in a camp hidden in the hills, far from any possible witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Chicano Federation, Latino/Latina Unity Coalition
and the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation had urged
Milliken to "send a message to would-be migrant bashers on this
stretch of the border."</TE>
<TE>   Said Luis Natividad of the Latino/Unity Coalition: "We're
satisfied that they didn't get off.... They should do some time."</TE>
<TE>   Victim Anastacio Irigoyen, 71, told Milliken through a translator:
"I am no longer well. My head is no longer well. They left me for
dead. They should be punished as adults."</TE>
<TE>   Alfred Sanchez, 65, said: "I would like for justice to be done....
I still feel fear, but now we know the law is looking upon them."</TE>
<TE>   Manduley, the son of a Navy officer deployed to the Arabian Sea,
told Milliken that he is trying to make amends for his role in the
attack by helping leave water in the desert for immigrants attempting
to enter this country.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how much I hurt them," Manduley said of the victims. "I
just want to apologize to them."</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers faced sentences of up to 12 years in prison after
pleading no contest to charges of assault, robbery, elder abuse and
committing a hate crime. Their families have settled civil suits
brought by the victims for $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The teenagers' attorneys unsuccessfully challenged Dist. Atty.
Paul Pfingst's decision to try the eight in Superior Court rather
than Juvenile Court. A challenge to Proposition 21, the state measure
that gives prosecutors greater authority to try juveniles as adults,
was rejected in April by the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The attack had outraged many in the community. When police were
initially unable to determine the identity of the attackers, rewards
were offered by the city government, the Chicano Federation and
Sempra Energy, corporate parent of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. A
reenactment of the crime was shown repeatedly on local television.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Informant Bilked by FBI, Suit Contends</HD>
<DH>Court: Man claims the agency encouraged him to infiltrate
drug cartel, then abandoned him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former law enforcement officer sued the FBI in Los Angeles federal
court Friday, alleging the agency abandoned him after he served for
years as a confidential informant infiltrating a violent drug cartel
in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed by Arizona resident Avery "Skip" Ensley, 56,
also contends the FBI bilked him and his wife out of more than $1
million in promised proceeds from the drugs, cash and weapons seized
during his years as an informant on an arm of the notorious Arellano
Felix syndicate.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the reasons I'm going forward with this thing is that I
want other people to know the FBI does not take care of its people,"
Ensley said by phone. "My experience is that they will put anybody at
risk for their own benefit."</LD>
<TE>   An FBI spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit, citing the
agency's policy not to discuss pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   According to his lawsuit, Ensley's odyssey as an informant began
in 1987, when he told the FBI that a man shot and killed by Upland
police was the brother of a major drug trafficker named Luis
Valenzuela. Valenzuela, the lawsuit says, was a leader of the Castro
drug organization, which for years ran the Los Angeles-area
operations for the Arellano Felix drug cartel.</TE>
<TE>   At the time he first spoke to the FBI, Ensley says in his suit, he
knew of Valenzuela's activities because the drug dealer's brother was
married to his own wife's sister.</TE>
<TE>   "When I learned of these drug connections, I couldn't look at
myself in the mirror knowing I had access to this information," said
Ensley, a onetime police officer in Oregon and police chief of North
Sioux City, S.D.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing Ensley's account of Valenzuela's drug activities,
the lawsuit claims, the FBI asked Ensley if he would try to "get
close" to Valenzuela and provide evidence that could be used in
prosecuting a case.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI repeatedly assured the Ensleys that the government would
do everything it could to protect them," the lawsuit says, claiming
agents also assured the Ensleys they would be "well compensated" with
a 10% share of all cash seized and 10% of the value of all drugs
collected in the investigation. With that understanding, the lawsuit
alleges, Ensley and his wife successfully fostered a "personal
relationship of trust" with Valenzuela that enabled them to provide
detailed information about his drug activities.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, according to the lawsuit, Ensley negotiated a
hand-to-hand purchase of black tar heroin for $24,000 in March 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, his lawsuit adds, Ensley arranged a meeting on a
yacht off Southern California where federal agents posing as drug
distributors were introduced to Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   Those activities, along with more than 15 trips to Mexico and
other evidence provided by Ensley, enabled the FBI to secure
court-ordered wiretaps and audiovisual recordings that were
eventually used in the successful prosecution of Valenzuela's drug
operation, according to the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, Valenzuela has been wanted on a federal fugitive
warrant after indictment under federal drug kingpin statutes,
according to federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   But in devoting themselves to the FBI investigation, the lawsuit
says, the Ensleys encountered "financially devastating"
consequences--losing two homes, a trucking business and a
construction company in South Dakota, as well as other business
ventures in Oregon and Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ensleys accepted these adverse financial consequences because
FBI agents repeatedly told them that they would be compensated for
their efforts," the lawsuit says.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, according to the Ensleys' attorney, Darius
Nickerson, the couple received less than $50,000 for their assistance
to the FBI even when, the lawsuit claims, they provided authorities
with leads resulting in the seizure of at least $12 million in cash
and more than 1,200 kilos of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely flabbergasted that they would put my family and I
at risk like this," Ensley said, "And do so with no more
consideration than if they were dealing with some person they've
arrested who's trying to make a deal."</TE>

<HD>Phil Interlandi, 78; Playboy Cartoonist Drew 'Queenie'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Interlandi, a veteran freelance magazine cartoonist whose work
appeared in national publications ranging from Look to Better Homes &amp;
Gardens but most notably Playboy, where he was a mainstay for
decades, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   A longtime resident of Laguna Beach, Interlandi died at his home
Wednesday of liver disease.</LD>
<LD>   He sold his first cartoon to Playboy in 1955. His color and
black-and-white cartoons have continued to appear regularly in the
magazine.</LD>
<TE>   "He had an acerbic wit," said Michelle Urry, Playboy cartoon
editor, adding that she had a batch of Interlandi's latest
submissions on her desk.</TE>
<TE>   "He just ran roughshod over all the sacred cows. He didn't care
about the taboos," she said.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker cartoonist Sam Gross, who had known Interlandi for 30
years, said: "He was really just a marvelous artist. He also really
knew how to draw good-looking girls and yet make the cartoon funny."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-born son of Sicilian immigrants, Interlandi showed
artistic ability at an early age--as did his identical twin, Frank,
who later became a syndicated political cartoonist for the Los
Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Phil Interlandi joined the Army at 17.</TE>
<TE>   He drew cartoons for The Yank, the Army newspaper, and was later a
prisoner of war in Germany, a subject "he didn't like to talk about,"
said his daughter, Liza Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Interlandi and his brother studied at the Chicago
Academy of Fine Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a brilliant draftsman and had always been," said
cartoonist Marty Murphy, a friend who also studied at the academy.
"From the time he was even in school, his draftsmanship was way above
the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Interlandi worked a number of years in advertising before becoming
a full-time freelance magazine cartoonist. A year after he moved to
Laguna Beach in 1952, his twin followed.</TE>
<TE>   The inseparable brothers were part of Laguna's colorful cadre of
cartoonists that grew to include Ed Nofziger, John Dempsey, Don
Tobin, Roger Armstrong, Dick Shaw, Virgil Partch and Dick Oldden.</TE>
<TE>   Following Phil Interlandi's lead, the cartoonists began a midday
ritual of taking a break from their drawing boards and meeting in the
bar at the White House restaurant on Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first bar I walked into in Laguna," Interlandi said
in 1982, "and it became a habit."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its merits as a watering hole, the White House was
the ideal setting for a group of cartoonists: It was near the post
office, where they could drop off their morning's output.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, Interlandi drew the syndicated cartoon strip
"Queenie," about a voluptuous blond secretary.</TE>
<TE>   He also illustrated a number of books, including Art Linkletter's
"Kids Say the Darndest Things" and "I Wish I'd Said That," in
addition to Dick Van Dyke's "Faith, Hope and Hilarity: The Child's
Eye View of Religion" and Ed McMahon's "The Barside Companion."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Stewart, Interlandi is survived by another daughter, Carla
Armstrong of Capistrano Beach; and son Joseph and brother Frank, both
of Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A service will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday at McCormick &amp; Son
Mortuary, 1795 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach.</TE>

<HD>College Dean Is Abusive, Five on Faculty Complain</HD>
<DH>Education: On the Irvine Valley campus, a secretary also
says she fears the head of physical education, who replies that it's
all sabotage over loyalty to a predecessor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All five tenured members of an Orange County community college
physical education department have filed a harassment complaint
against their dean, and his secretary has told campus police she
fears for her safety after he allegedly chased her down a corridor
and cornered her.</LD>
<LD>   Rod Poindexter, dean of health sciences, physical education and
athletics at Irvine Valley College, has been the subject of faculty
complaints since shortly after he started his job a year ago. He
denies the allegations and says he is caught between administrators
and faculty allied with the former athletic director, who was passed
over for the dean's job.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation is underway, but Raghu Mathur, chancellor of the
South Orange County Community College District, declined to discuss
the complaint, saying it was a personnel matter.</LD>
<TE>   "Dr. Poindexter is becoming more and more isolated," said the
11-page complaint filed with the college, a copy of which was
obtained by The Times. Signing it were basketball coach Jerry
Hernandez; Martin McGrogan, coach of men's soccer and the
state-champion women's badminton team; Ted Weatherford, former
chairman of the physical education department; dance instructor
Kathryn Milostan-Egus and Aracely Mora, the former athletic director
and interim dean.</TE>
<TE>   "His behavior has created an environment where there is fear that
he can 'snap' and physically hurt others and himself. We need help.
The abuse, retaliation and discrimination need to stop."</TE>
<TE>   Poindexter, 52, said in an interview that the faculty members have
tried to sabotage him because of their loyalty to Mora. He also said
he has been caught in the war between the campus faculty and the
administration.</TE>
<TE>   That larger struggle has been going on since 1997, when Mathur,
now chancellor, was appointed Irvine Valley president. There have
been faculty no-confidence votes against Mathur, lawsuits and an
ongoing power struggle over anything from class scheduling to faculty
appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Poindexter called the confrontation with his secretary "a fake
incident" and said, "People try to do anything to get rid of me."</TE>
<TE>   A number of faculty members interviewed said the administration is
investigating the complaint, and some of them said they had been
interviewed for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Irvine Valley, Poindexter was athletic training
director and an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond, Va. Irvine Valley officials said Poindexter
was hired after a nationwide search.</TE>
<TE>   Before Poindexter took the job, the athletic director reported to
the dean. When the dean stepped down, the jobs were combined. Mora,
athletic director for 11 years, and extremely well-liked by her
staff, filled the interim post for about a year.</TE>
<TE>   Psychology professor John Lowe, a member of the hiring committee,
said the panel ranked Mora as the top candidate and Poindexter third.
The group forwarded its choices to Mathur, who recommended that the
Board of Trustees appoint Poindexter to the $97,000-a-year job.
Because Mora's regular post of athletic director no longer existed,
she returned to being a full-time professor.</TE>
<TE>   Poindexter started his job July 2. He said that, during his three
days of interviews for the job, no one told him about the conflicts
between the faculty and administration.</TE>
<TE>   He said that if he had known Mora was a candidate, "I wouldn't
have even come out for the interview. I didn't know the real story
until I signed my contract and got here."</TE>
<TE>   The complaint from the five faculty members is dated April 22. It
asks that the dean "be removed from the campus during the
investigation ... in order to protect the safety of the department
members and the liability of the school district."</TE>
<TE>   Poindexter said he had not seen the complaint but denied the
charges. "I'm an open, honest person," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His secretary, Suzie Franzoni, has filed a claim with the
district, a precursor to a lawsuit, over her dealings with
Poindexter.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged confrontation between Franzoni and Poindexter occurred
Jan. 4. Poindexter said the relationship between them had been
getting worse. "She went to the other side and started working
against me."</TE>
<TE>   According to the campus police report, Franzoni had just come from
a meeting with Poindexter in which he had told her she was not doing
her work. She walked to the office of Weatherford, the former
chairman of the physical education department. According to her
statement to campus police, "In the next moment, Rod [Poindexter]
came charging down the hallway directly at me. Rod pinned me in the
corner against the wall" and began screaming at her.</TE>
<TE>   Franzoni also filed a report with the Irvine police department the
same day. The officer wrote that Franzoni "repeatedly broke out into
tears and had to take several minutes to compose herself. I could
sense [she] was very scared of Poindexter and very frustrated because
the school officials don't seem to be taking the situation
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Brent Shaver, Irvine Valley's sports information officer, told
campus police "what I did witness was Dr. Poindexter putting Suzie in
a scary and threatening position."</TE>
<TE>   In his statement to police, Weatherford, who later signed the
complaint against the dean, wrote, "Poindexter charged down the hall
shouting at Suzie that he was her boss not me and that she should
only talk to him. Suzie was pinned in a corner and very
frightened.... This is not the first time this type of behavior has
occurred. Other female employees have expressed concerns with their
safety and Dean Poindexter's behavior."</TE>

<HD>3 Federal Judges in California Swim Against a Fervent
National Tide</HD>
<DH>Law: Jurists in controversial Pledge of Allegiance and
terror group rulings have long been fierce champions of the rights of
individuals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN and DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One is a moderate Republican appointed to the bench by President
Nixon. Another is a liberal Democrat married to the director of the
Southern California chapter of the ACLU. The third, who spent part of
his youth in a World War II internment camp, is a Democrat who was
appointed by a Republican. The three California-based federal judges
are from disparate backgrounds, but all defied the national mood of
patriotism and security fears in the past week with controversial
rulings on the Pledge of Allegiance and terrorism. All three time and
again have taken strong stands protecting individual rights over the
objections of government--and indeed, the majority of individuals.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, a moderate Republican, and Judge Stephen
R. Reinhardt, a liberal Democrat, joined together on the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday in a wildly unpopular ruling that
declared the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution because
it contains the words "under God."</LD>
<LD>   A few days earlier, Los Angeles U.S. District Judge Robert M.
Takasugi, a Democrat appointed by former President Ford, ruled that
the process by which the government classifies groups as terrorist in
nature deprives the organizations of their constitutional rights.</LD>
<TE>   The rulings come at a time when many Americans fear more terrorist
attacks and feel an urge to display their patriotism with American
flags on their homes, businesses and cars.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know the three jurists said they were not surprised they
made highly sensitive legal calls that were likely to offend.
Although different in temperament and philosophy, the three judges
are known for their fierce independence. Each has decades of
experience on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin, 79, who was appointed to the federal bench by Nixon,
wrote the Pledge of Allegiance ruling. It said the pledge violates
the 1st Amendment because the words "one nation, under God," endorse
religion.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 decision was a victory for a Sacramento County atheist who
objected to teacher-led recitations of the pledge at his daughter's
elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   The man who wrote the ruling, which set off an explosive reaction
from President Bush on down, is regarded as a strong individualist
who has no compunction about ruling against the government.</TE>
<TE>   When observers mention he is a Republican, they stress he is an
"Oregon Republican," not beholden to ideology. Before becoming a
federal judge, Goodwin spent nine years on the Oregon Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a real Westerner," said Judge Reinhardt, who, like Goodwin,
is being assailed for the pledge ruling. "He is very independent,
very straight, very plain-spoken, a delightful person to deal
with.... You can't place him easily in any philosophy other than a
straight, old-fashioned kind of approach to life."</TE>
<TE>   An 'Oregon Cowboy'</TE>
<TE>   Unpretentious and unassuming, Goodwin has been described as an
Oregon cowboy. He has a cabin in the Oregon mountains. He rides
horses and lists his hobbies as canoeing and hiking.</TE>
<TE>   He is among the best-liked jurists on the 9th Circuit bench.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a mild-mannered guy, a very sweet man," said UC Berkeley
law professor Jesse Choper.</TE>
<TE>   Among the subjects Goodwin is most passionate about is the
importance of a judiciary that is independent of political pressures.</TE>
<TE>   He was chief judge of the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit at a
time when there was a concerted effort to divide the circuit, which
covers nine states, into two separate courts.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians from the Northwest led the drive because they were
unhappy with many of the court's environmental rulings, including
decisions Goodwin wrote or joined. Decisions by the 9th Circuit are
the law, unless overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, in all nine
states it covers--California, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "He weathered a lot of the attacks on the 9th Circuit as chief
judge," said University of Santa Clara law professor Gerry Uelmen.
"He put up a vigorous defense."</TE>
<TE>   Although Goodwin fought hard to preserve the 9th Circuit, "his
career has not been marked by being in the center of controversy,"
said Mark Perry, a Washington civil lawyer who previously clerked for
the court.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Goodwin's low-key demeanor has made him a bit of a
mystery, Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt, by contrast, has always been in the spotlight--and
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as we heard the news of the decision, my wife turned to
me and said: 'That has got to be Reinhardt,' " Uelmen said.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt, 71, is one of the most liberal federal judges in the
nation, a jurist who rules as he sees fit even if he knows the
Supreme Court will certainly overturn him.</TE>
<TE>   "It is remarkable how often Judge Reinhardt appears as either the
author or the second vote for so many of the 9th Circuit's
controversial decisions," said Perry, who clerked for 9th Circuit
Judge Alex Kozinski. "In this term alone, he authored two decisions
that were reversed and joined two others that were reversed.</TE>
<TE>   "Four decisions reversed in a single term is a pretty remarkable
record, unless you are Judge Reinhardt."</TE>
<TE>   Before former President Carter appointed him to the 9th Circuit,
Reinhardt was a labor lawyer in Los Angeles and a Democratic Party
activist. He was reared in a show business family--his stepfather was
a film director and producer who worked on "The Red Badge of Courage"
and "Command Decision"--and big-name stars were not infrequent
visitors to his family's Los Angeles home.</TE>
<TE>   He is married to Ramona Ripston, executive director of the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   A judge's role is not to "see that the majority prevails,"
Reinhardt said in an interview the day after the ruling on the Pledge
of Allegiance. "That is why we have a Bill of Rights--so a court will
see that the majority doesn't take away the rights of those they
don't agree with."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is undaunted by criticism. "It would be nice if
everyone agreed with me," he said with a chuckle. "But the
Constitution is not always very popular, and individual rights are
not always very popular in this country, particularly in time of
national crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt noted that many Supreme Court decisions are decided by a
5-4 vote, "and that doesn't mean that the five are correct."</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt has been described as relentless when he thinks he is
correct. He does not back down.</TE>
<TE>   He has no qualms about taking jabs at the U.S. Supreme Court or
the president, and he takes pride in being a liberal even though many
would shy away from the label.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt takes rulings by the more conservative Supreme Court and
crafts them into a fashion that supports his views, Choper said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is not off the wall with his reasoning, but he is quite out
there with his results," the UC Berkeley law professor said. "And he
knows it. He feels that is his role. He is an activist. He thinks the
courts are there to do good."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the ever-amiable Goodwin, Reinhardt has a reputation for
being gruff and at times impatient on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawyers who appear before him aren't always thrilled with the
experience," said Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf, who
clerked for Reinhardt more than a decade ago. "He doesn't want to
play games. He wants to get to the bottom of the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi, 71, is a mixture of the other men. Serving at a lower
level, on the lower federal district court in Los Angeles, Takasugi
is often described as liberal, but he doesn't embrace the label.</TE>
<TE>   His ruling on terror groups late last Friday did not stir the
national outcry of the pledge decision, but it too was based on a
reading of the Constitution that protected individual rights at the
expense of government and in defiance of public attitudes in the wake
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi threw out an indictment against seven Los Angeles
residents accused of raising money for an Iranian opposition group
that had been placed on the State Department's list of terrorist
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The federal district judge said the law classifying terrorist
groups denies organizations their constitutional due-process rights
because they are not given a chance to rebut the allegations before
being put on the list.</TE>
<TE>   "National security is certainly a matter of grave concern,"
Takasugi wrote in a 19-page opinion. "When weighed against a
fundamental constitutional right which defines our very existence,
the argument for national security should not serve as an excuse for
obliterating the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argued that a federal appeals court in Washington,
D.C., had previously upheld the State Department's designation
procedure and that Takasugi was obliged to go along.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not share this view," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   "This court understands its oath to uphold the Constitution and
apply only those laws made in conformance to and pursuance of the
Constitution," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not abdicate this duty and allow this criminal case to
proceed if the evidence indicates that one element of the
offense--the foreign terrorist designation--was procured in violation
of the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Challenge Is Key</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi's ruling has no immediate effect beyond the case before
him. If, however, the prosecution challenges the ruling before U.S.
9th Circuit Court and loses, Takasugi's decision could become law
throughout the circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi's decision to become a lawyer was spurred by childhood
experience. When he was 11, the U.S. government gave his family two
weeks to vacate their home in Tacoma, Wash., and report for
relocation to an internment camp at Tule Lake, Calif., along with
thousands of other Japanese Americans.</TE>
<TE>   His father, who had been a commercial fisherman, had trouble
coping with his inability to protect and support his family during
internment. After 2 1/2 years in the camp, his father died at the age
of 57.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he died, if anything, of the stress that was caused [by
feeling] he was totally helpless," Takasugi told the Daily Journal, a
legal newspaper, in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi, like Goodwin and Reinhardt, is no ivory-tower jurist
with little sense of the practical effects and reactions his rulings
will bring. He has presided over several high-profile trials,
including the cocaine-trafficking prosecution of John Z. DeLorean,
who was acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Takasugi is "very careful in his rulings," said a prosecutor who
now has a case before the judge, "and, even though he may go against
us, he does his research and knows the case through and through."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers also like him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's probably the preeminent judge in this district who
understands what the Constitution really means," said veteran
criminal defense lawyer Errol H. Stambler, who just completed an
eight-week jury trial before Takasugi.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges rule with an eye to what the U.S. Supreme Court would
want. Others apply the precedents as they see fit. Goodwin, Reinhardt
and Takasugi are in that latter camp.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether the job of lower court judges is to apply
the precedents as they understand them or try to put themselves in
the mind of their bosses on the U.S. Supreme Court," said Dorf, the
Columbia law professor.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no clear, right answer."</TE>

<HD>Slayings Preceded by Sex Assaults</HD>
<DH>Canoga Park: Man attacked two women in apartment before he
shot and killed one of them and then himself, police say. Identities
of the dead are revealed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman and a man who died in an apparent murder-suicide in a Canoga
Park apartment were identified Friday, and police said the crime also
involved sexual assaults on the woman and her adult sister.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives said Jesus Aguirre, 38,
of Canoga Park, sexually attacked both women and then shot Susana
Guadalupe Centeno, 27, in her apartment Thursday morning before
turning the gun on himself.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said they have not determined what prompted the
incident.</LD>
<TE>   "We are still trying to figure out what happened and what the
motive is," said Robbery Homicide Division Lt. Carlos Velez. "We
still don't know why he would do this heinous thing."</TE>
<TE>   According to detectives, Aguirre was at Centeno's apartment late
Wednesday when neighbors reported hearing a loud argument at the
home.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, about 9:30 a.m., a maintenance worker at the complex
knocked on the door of Centeno's ground-floor apartment and was told
to enter.</TE>
<TE>   As he opened the door, he heard a gunshot and saw a man exit the
bedroom, enter the living room and shoot himself, according to Velez.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre was an acquaintance of Centeno's, but police said he was
not the father of her two young children, who were in the apartment
at the time of the incident. The children were taken into protective
custody by the county Department of Children and Family Services. The
woman's two older children, who were not at home at the time, are
staying with relatives.</TE>
<TE>   At the apartment complex, Centeno was remembered as a friendly
woman who sold Avon products to neighbors. Aguirre was unemployed,
police said.</TE>

<HD>Latino Politicians Take Stock of Gains</HD>
<DH>Elections: Candidates say they raised voter turnout despite
attempts to play on racial fears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE</DL>
<LD>Candidates who lost historic races for mayor in three of America's
largest cities delivered a message that was at once sobering and
upbeat at a national gathering of Latino officials Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents played on racial fears, and the media called them Latino
candidates, limiting their appeal, the leaders told the 19th annual
conference of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials.</LD>
<LD>   But each of them said their campaigns brought record turnouts of
Latino voters and forged important coalitions with other groups, an
indication that Latinos are making progress in their quest for
inclusion in American political life.</LD>
<TE>   "We opened a door that will never close again," said former
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, who was the top vote-getter in
the 2001 Los Angeles mayoral primary but lost in the runoff, marked
in its final days by ads implying that Villaraigosa was soft on crime
and tied to gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Villaraigosa on a panel were Fernando Ferrer, the former
Bronx borough president who lost a bruising Democratic primary last
fall for mayor of New York City, and Orlando Sanchez, who lost in a
heated runoff for mayor of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrer said he tried to counter charges that he was borderline
irresponsible, racially divisive and likely to raise taxes with
television testimonials from some of New York's best-known Democrats,
including former Mayor Ed Koch, past vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro and former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Sanchez said his campaign was derailed in the final
days when his opponent, Mayor Lee P. Brown, an African American,
suggested that he was insensitive to hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But Sanchez said he does not regret running a campaign that
focused on such issues as public safety and city services.</TE>
<TE>   "I never responded to any of the negative attacks. I chose to
focus on the issues," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   While negative campaigning may work in the short run, there is a
price to pay down the road, the candidates said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrer noted that many New York Latinos, along with blacks and
many white Democrats, deserted their party's candidate in the general
election, helping propel Republican media mogul Michael Bloomberg
into the mayor's office. Ferrer said with obvious relish that
Bloomberg called him at 1:30 a.m. the day after the election and
invited him to breakfast that morning.</TE>
<TE>   All three said candidates must reach out to other constituencies.
Villaraigosa said he found it particularly galling to be continually
described as the Latino candidate, or to have voters constantly
reminded that he would be the first Latino mayor in recent Los
Angeles history, sending the message that he was different and
undercutting his vision of a unified city.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa said that James K. Hahn, the day after winning the
mayor's race, was booed at a Los Angeles Lakers game. A few days
later, Villaraigosa said, he attended a Lakers game and was
applauded.</TE>
<TE>   All three candidates showed they could energize Latino voters, who
historically have a low turnout. In Houston, where Latino turnout
previously was about 9%, 18% voted last year. Overwhelmingly Mexican
American and Democrats, most voted for Sanchez, a Republican
immigrant from Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Each said there was little, if anything, they would change if they
run again. While none ruled out the possibility, none of them made
any announcements.</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, whom some leaders are urging to run for City
Council, said only that he intends to stay in public service.</TE>

<HD>Museum in Black Closing, Out of Funds</HD>
<DH>Culture: Impending loss of Leimert Park Village institution
worries merchants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than 15 years as a tourist draw, a distinctive African
American museum is being evicted from its storefront in Leimert Park
Village, leaving some merchants concerned about how the departure
will affect their efforts to boost tourist traffic in the cultural
enclave.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of the Museum in Black--described in the Rough Guide to
Los Angeles as "the chief cultural institution" in the village--is
seen as a setback to efforts by merchants to attract more tourists
and to increase sales in the adjacent art galleries, coffee shops and
performance houses.</LD>
<LD>   "People come from out of state or call asking about the museum,"
said Laura Hendrix, president of the Leimert Park Merchants' Assn.
and owner of the Gallery Plus art gallery near the museum.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still in the process of building up the area. And it's
catching on." Losing the museum "knocks us down a few notches. We
desperately need that kind of business here on the street."</TE>
<TE>   The street is Degnan Boulevard, which runs through the center of
the village between 43rd Street and 43rd Place, just east of Crenshaw
Boulevard. Over the last 10 years, merchants in the dozen-plus small
shops in the village have tried to create a pedestrian-friendly
shopping and dining draw with an Afrocentric theme. One of the main
drawing cards, merchants said, has been the Museum in Black--an
eclectic collection of African American slave and civil-rights era
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Breye, owner of the museum, said he was served papers early
this week requiring him to leave the space--more than 3,000 square
feet full of leg irons, slave posters and Jim Crow signs--by Sunday,
after a dispute with the landlord over rent.</TE>
<TE>   Edward MacDaniel, owner of the building that includes the Museum
in Black and several other storefronts, said Breye owes him $20,000
in back rent and has been behind in payments off and on for years.
Breye countered that the figure is closer to $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Both men acknowledged that the store, in an area recently spruced
up by the city and promoted by the Los Angeles Convention and
Visitors' Bureau, could fetch several times the $1,100 per month that
Breye has been charged.</TE>
<TE>   "He pays $1,000; I can get $3,000. What would you do?" asked
MacDaniel. "I pay $6,000 in insurance costs alone."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to resolve the matter, Breye, known informally as the
"Mayor of Leimert Park," spent the week boxing up more than 300 years
of African and African American history: masks from Cameroon,
intricately carved statues from Mali, grisly photos of Southern U.S.
lynchings. At one point he had more than 5,000 pieces shoehorned into
the small shop, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent 39 years collecting African art and memorabilia, slave
shackles, posters," he said, his voice trailing off in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Breye, who has relied largely on donations and proceeds from
school tours to keep the place afloat, said the museum has never been
a money-maker.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the hole since the day I moved in here," he said. "I
sell something to pay the rent, to pay the phone, to pay the lights.
And if I can't sell something, I scramble around and do odd jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Breye and other community members are scrambling to find
storage space for the artifacts and an eventual new home for the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a loss," said Valerie Holton, owner of Black LA
Tours, who has escorted culture-seeking tourists in and out of the
museum regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one of the main places that you could go to have a piece
of history from the African American perspective. It will affect me
tremendously," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While agreeing that the departure represents a loss, Melissa
Hayes, director of cultural tourism for the Convention and Visitors
Bureau, said she thinks the momentum already building in the area
will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of different things that have happened in the
area. The landscape architecture was recognized nationally," Hayes
said. "I think the Museum in Black is one of those landmark
destinations," she added. "But it's not one store that makes Leimert
Park. One store leaving, yes, it's a tremendous loss. But the
community has been moving so far along, I don't see that one move
making it stop."</TE>

<HD>Gino Merli, 78; Medal of Honor Winner in WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gino J. Merli, who was awarded a Medal of Honor in World War II for
continuing to man his machine gun through a long night in Belgium in
which his position was overrun by Germans, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Merli, who twice feigned death only to continue firing at the
enemy, died June 12 at his home in Peckville, Pa. He had been
battling heart and kidney problems and Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   A private first class and machine gunner with the 18th Infantry of
the 1st Infantry Division, Merli was part of a 14-man roadblock set
up near Belgian town of Sars-la-Bruyere on the night of Sept. 4,
1944.</LD>
<TE>   About 8 p.m., an American patrol reported that at least 100 German
soldiers were headed down the cobblestone road. When the Americans
opened fire, the Germans scattered.</TE>
<TE>   But the superior German numbers and firepower soon took their
toll: Two GIs were killed, four were injured and many of the
remaining Americans were taken prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   The Germans came down the road four times to try to knock off his
gun emplacement, Merli recalled in Tom Brokaw's book "The Greatest
Generation Speaks."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Germans came, around 4 a.m., they found two
seemingly lifeless bodies in their foxholes: Merli and his assistant
gunner.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the German soldiers turned around to leave, thinking
their job was done, Merli opened fire and killed several. But Merli's
assistant gunner was killed in the return fire, leaving Merli alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Another group came down later," recalled Merli, who again
pretended to be dead. "They said something in German. I assume it was
that nobody was there. So when they moved on, I opened fire by
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Merli stayed at his weapon throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   After daybreak, American troops launched an assault, and the
remaining Germans surrendered. When the shooting ended, 52 enemy
bodies were found, 19 of them directly in front of Merli's gun.</TE>
<TE>   His Medal of Honor citation notes that Merli's "gallantry and
courage, and the losses and confusion that he caused the enemy,
contributed materially to our victory."</TE>
<TE>   That morning Merli asked permission to visit a village church to
pray for the dead--those on both sides. His sergeant and a couple of
other squad members joined him.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how bitter you were against the enemy," Merli said,
"you still had the heart to pray for him. Because he was in the same
boat as you and I."</TE>
<TE>   Merli, who had participated in the D-day invasion of Normandy,
later fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded three times
during the war, taking hits to his leg and wrists during the Battle
of the Bulge and, on that road in Belgium, four wounds to his
buttocks when German soldiers prodded him with their bayonets to see
if he was dead.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a coal miner, Merli was born in Scranton, Pa. After the
war, he served as an administrator for the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Plains Township, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Mary; sons Geno of Haddon Heights,
N.J., and Phillip of Greenville, N.C.; a daughter, Maria Zeitz of San
Antonio; a brother; a sister; and six grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Leslie Midgley, 87; Developed TV Specials on Breaking News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leslie Midgley, veteran newsman who began his career in print
journalism and went on to pioneer the "instant special" for
television, producing more than 1,500 programs for CBS News
chronicling such historic events as the assassination of President
Kennedy and the Vietnam War, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Midgley died June 19 of pneumonia at a White Plains, N.Y.,
hospital, where he was taken after a fall at his home in Hartsdale,
N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   In his 1989 autobiography, "How Many Words Do You Want? An
Insider's Stories of Print and Television Journalism," he said: "News
is what an editor decides it is."</LD>
<TE>   He concluded his career as a television producer, but he had
started in newspapers, embarking on his career in 1935, when he was a
20-year-old government typist and visited friends at the Washington
Post.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided almost from my first look inside," he wrote in his
autobiography, "that if you could actually get paid for doing this,
there was no reason whatsoever to do anything else. Anything."</TE>
<TE>   Within 15 years, however, he had stretched the meaning of
"anything" to include television, and he spent the next 28 years
expanding that new medium's impact.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Midgley was in
charge of all prime-time news coverage at CBS. Over the four days
from the shooting in Dallas on a Friday to Kennedy's interment at
Arlington National Cemetery the next Monday, Midgley pioneered the
continuous on-air, commercial-free reportage now familiar for major
news events.</TE>
<TE>   About midnight on the day of the assassination, Midgley recalled
in his book, he began to wonder aloud how long he should keep
commentator Eric Sevareid on the air. A voice behind him said, "Les,
stay on just as long as you want." It was network boss Frank Stanton,
who kept the network ad-free until Kennedy's funeral, forcing other
networks to follow suit. At the end of the four days, Midgley agreed
with Stanton, who said: "Television news will never be the same."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Midgley won further praise for his thorough,
balanced four-part analysis of the report by the Warren Commission,
which concluded that no conspiracy had led to the assassination.</TE>
<TE>   The producer received three Emmy Awards and six Peabody Awards for
work that included a three-hour special on the day Saigon fell in
1975.</TE>
<TE>   He also exploited new technologies, incorporating videotape
delivered by jet to produce up-to-the-minute news coverage from
anywhere in the world. From 1967 to 1972 he was executive producer of
"The Evening News" with Walter Cronkite.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Salt Lake City, Midgley was a University of Utah dropout
who used his family connections--his grandfather Heber J. Grant was
president of the Mormon Church--to land his first job as police
reporter at the Deseret News.</TE>
<TE>   That was 1935, still an era of the itinerant journeyman journalist
who could move easily from newspaper to newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Midgley did just that--moving on to the Denver Post, the
Louisville Courier-Journal, the Chicago Times, back to the Deseret
News as city editor and then, in 1940, to New York City. He was hired
at the New York World Telegram and within six months had moved to the
New York Herald-Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Midgley proved to be a natural as a rewrite man, producing
readable, informative stories from rough notes or poor copy turned in
by other reporters.</TE>
<TE>   He took the title of his autobiography from a question he asked
his World-Telegram boss: "How long do you want this story? And what
do you want it to say?" He was seeking guidance for the
practicalities of journalism--space or time available and salient
points deemed necessary--requirements he would adapt for decades on
the page and later on television.</TE>
<TE>   Midgley spent a decade with the Herald-Tribune, most of it toward
the end of World War II and afterward in the Paris office of the
international edition. He then spent several years editing magazines,
Collier's and then Look, where he was managing editor.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Midgley joined CBS to work with Andy Rooney writing a new
morning pilot program called "F.Y.I." Soon, Midgley was producing a
half-hour news show featuring Sevareid.</TE>
<TE>   By 1956, Midgley had begun producing his new instant specials on
major international events, including coverage of the Hungarian
revolt, the Suez invasion and "The Face of Red China," which earned
an Emmy and a Peabody.</TE>
<TE>   Midgley was named producer of "Eyewitness to History," later
"Eyewitness," in 1959, overseeing 148 programs about the most
important story of the week.</TE>
<TE>   After years of producing evening programming, including "The
Evening News," he returned to documentaries from 1972 until his
retirement from CBS in 1980, when the Washington Post saluted him as
"the man who practically invented 'instant specials.' " Midgley
worked briefly for NBC News as vice president for special programs
but soon resigned to teach.</TE>
<TE>   He was widowed twice, first by the death in 1965 of his first
wife, Jean Burke, and in 1994 by the death of his second wife,
consumer advocate Betty Furness. Midgley is survived by his three
children with Burke, Leslie Midgley of Hague, N.Y., Andrea Connors of
Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and Peter Midgley of Mesa, Ariz.; a
stepdaughter, Babbie Green of Sherman Oaks; two sisters, Ann Gowans
and Joy Orr; a brother, Grant; two grandchildren; and one
step-granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Midgley clearly relished his time in newspapers, but also
understood what television meant for universal communications.</TE>
<TE>   "That baby," he said of the medium he helped nurture, "stirred in
its cradle as the decade of the 1950s began, then shot up like Jack's
beanstalk. Because it brought into American living rooms
entertainment, great events as they actually occurred, sports--and
daily news."</TE>
<TE>   "Television has, in the last 40 years," he wrote in his
autobiography, "opened wide magic windows through which the entire
citizenry, down to the youngest, the most impoverished and the least
educated, can watch--and hopefully in some degree understand--what is
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Midgley helped make that happen.</TE>

<LD>Twenty-seven white-gloved cadets marched through the campus of Golden
West College in Huntington Beach on Friday to graduate from the
school's police academy.</LD>
<LD>   All but three had shaved their heads. Those with hair neatly
tucked into their police caps were the few women who took on the
rigorous six-month training required to become a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   Despite continued efforts to recruit women, many don't consider
law enforcement as a career, said David S. Barr, director of the
Criminal Justice Training Center at Golden West College. Although
recent classes have averaged three women, last semester there were
none.</LD>
<TE>   Despite recruitment efforts over the last decade to diversify the
ranks, a study two years ago by the Los Angeles Times showed Orange
County's police departments lagging the national average when it
comes to employing female officers.</TE>
<TE>   Women make up about 14% of sworn officers nationwide, but they
account for about 9% of the ranks in Orange County, according to
information provided by all 22 agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The number represented a slight increase from 1989, when the
county average was about 8%.</TE>
<TE>   "We have come a long way with minorities and women but we always
want to see even more diversity," said La Habra Police Chief Dennis
Kies, secretary of the Orange County Police Chiefs Assn. Barr said
women recruits, as well as men, often need to improve their
upper-body strength to scale a six-foot wall during training. While
many women are not as strong as male officers, they often bring
better communication skills to the job, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Breeze, 36, of Dana Point said the training was tough but
not tough enough to stop her. Breeze is a former professional
cyclist.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard, but I like hard training," said Breeze, who will
work for the Tustin Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Randall, 21, of San Juan Capistrano had previously worked in
a police department explorer program and longed for the chance to
become an officer.</TE>
<TE>   The training "wasn't overly hard, but it was hard enough to stress
me out," said Randall, who will join the Huntington Beach Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The police academy training program requires cadets to complete
966 hours of training over 24 weeks. Training covers procedures in
cases ranging from homicide to sexual assault to missing persons.</TE>

<HD>Nurses See Firing as Silencing Ploy</HD>
<DH>Labor: Eighteen critical- care staff lose jobs after
'sickout' at Hollywood Presbyterian. They say it's result of speaking
up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NERISSA PACIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center fired 18 of its
critical-care nurses Friday for participating in what the hospital
described as an unlawful sickout the day before the nurses' union
went on strike.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital officials said the nurses, who are members of Service
Employees International Union Local 399, broke federal labor law by
calling in sick the day before a May 24 strike. The hospital said the
law prohibits such actions within 10 days of the start of a strike.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe these 18 nurses took part in a premeditated action
that could have put patients at risk," said Albert Greene, chief
executive officer of Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical
Center. "We had more than a dozen critically ill premature infants in
one of the affected units.... Luckily we were able to quickly
respond."</LD>
<TE>   Several of the fired nurses said their absences were not part of
an organized sickout. They said Tenet Corp., which owns the hospital,
has used the terminations as a tactic to silence those nurses who
were the most vocal in criticizing low staffing levels.</TE>
<TE>   The union represents 500 nurses at the hospital. A small number of
them, along with some other hospital employees represented by Local
399, struck for four days in May after their contract expired and
again for four days this month. Negotiations have been suspended.
Union members rejected the hospital's final offer of an 11% raise
over three years and better health benefits. Union members are asking
for a one-year pact with a 7% raise and a more affordable
health-insurance package.</TE>
<TE>   One of the fired nurses, Asuncion Sommer, who said she had worked
at the hospital for 25 years, said she had complained about staffing
levels in hospital meetings. "These patients need constant care, so I
spoke up," said Sommer, who works in the cardiac intensive-care unit.</TE>
<TE>   Sommer said her photo has now been added to a poster of employees
who have been banned from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses said veteran nurses who are familiar with the
hospital's computer systems and supplies have been replaced with
out-of-state nurses who are not as qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said all replacement nurses are licensed in California and
must attend orientation sessions to familiarize themselves with the
hospital before they begin work.</TE>
<TE>   The 18 terminated nurses were among 27 whom the hospital suspended
for failing to show up for their shifts the day before the May 24
strike. Five of those nurses were allowed to resume work after the
hospital found they had not taken part in the sickout. Three others
have resigned and one remains suspended, Greene said.</TE>

<HD>Oil Companies Lose Appeal on Fullerton Superfund Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Environment: A federal court rejects their bid to make the
U.S. pay for removal of toxic waste. Firms argued that the pollution
was part of the 1940s war effort.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Friday rejected a bid by oil companies to
make the U.S. government pay for the $100-million cleanup of the
McColl property in Fullerton, where the companies dumped toxic waste
during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
reaffirms an earlier decision by that court, making the oil companies
responsible for 95% of cleanup costs on the 22-acre site, where more
than 100,000 cubic yards of toxic byproducts were dumped in the
1940s.</LD>
<LD>   The property was placed on the federal Environmental Protection
Agency's Superfund list in 1983 after investigators found sulfuric
acid, benzene and other potentially hazardous substances there. By
1998, the land was cleaned up and now is part of a golf course. The
cleanup involved a multilayer cap, gas-collection system and
groundwater equipment to monitor the site.</LD>
<TE>   Although that process won national praise and was used as a model
for other toxic-waste sites, the issue of who should pay for it
remained in dispute. A district court judge ruled in 1998 that the
U.S. government should foot the bill because the dumping by Atlantic
Richfield Co., Shell Oil Co., Texaco Inc. and Union Oil Co. was part
of the war effort.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court reversed that decision, finding that the
government did not order the companies to dispose of their sludge at
the McColl site. The companies asked the court to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   The toxic sludge was a byproduct of a special high-octane gas the
government ordered for the military. It was reusable, but the
recycling process was slow and costly, threatening to bottleneck gas
production plants at the height of the war. So the companies began
dumping it at McColl, a facility set up by private citizen Eli McColl
to dispose of the sludge.</TE>
<TE>   "The oil companies had other disposal options for their acid
waste," Judge William A. Fletcher wrote in Friday's ruling. "They
were not compelled by the government to dump waste in any particular
manner."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court did order the U.S. government to pay for the
cleanup of sludge from government-owned benzol dumped at
McColl--about 5% of the hazardous material there.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials declared the ruling a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice remains pleased with the result of this
case and is certainly pleased the court denied the oil companies'
petition for rehearing," spokeswoman Dana Perino said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the oil companies did not return calls Friday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the site have rallied behind the oil companies,
arguing that they were key in cleaning the property and that the
government should take responsibility for the pressure it put on
companies to produce during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be at least 50-50," said David Bushey, who has lived in
a house next to the site for 24 years. "The government is great at
ordering people to do stuff and then denying culpability years
later."</TE>

<LD>The latest stupid criminal tricks entry involves a couple of young
burglars who broke into a Westside elementary school one evening and
found a pair of walkie-talkies. All the better to communicate with
during the mission ... they figured.</LD>
<LD>   Only problem, reports the Star News, an L.A. County Sheriff's
Department publication, was that "a janitor working at another school
could hear everything they were saying." They discussed what code
they would use as a signal if the cops appeared and what they would
say to explain the money they had stolen. They even reminisced about
a previous burglary at another school.</LD>
<LD>   The youths were exiting with their loot just as deputies dropped
by the school.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about a show of defiance for law and order! "Our son Jay is a
deputy district attorney in Palo Alto," writes Abe Boyarsky of La
Mirada. "He took this picture in Northern California" (see photo).</TE>

<TE>   Luxury lavs: The makers of "MIIB", the new "Men in Black" movie,
rented the Santa Monica Pier for a premiere party the other night.
Yup, just got the pier all to themselves, including the (free)
pinball games. Of course, they had to make a few improvements. For
example, the portable toilets they brought along were truly grand.</TE>
<TE>   On the inside, the facilities were graced by mirrors, shelves for
purses (men's or women's), sinks and, of course, carpets (beige). And
there were warning lights on the outside in case it was occupe. Those
Hollywood folks sure know how to live!</TE>
<TE>   Oy vey! Luigi Smaldino of L'Italo Americano newspaper points out
that I misspelled "tutti" in the item about the Italian restaurant
that requires diners to store their cell phones for "la tranquillita
di tutti."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Insult of the Day: David Karber of Long Beach snapped the
suspiciously misspelled directional sign at an onramp to U.S. 66 in
Williams, Ariz. (see photo). It expresses somewhat the same sentiment
as an Arizona sign on U.S. 60 heading toward the California border.
That one says: "You're Leaving Hope." (OK, I admit it is outside the
town of Hope.)</TE>
<TE>   Dollars and scents: Doug Disney of Rolling Hills Estates wondered

<HD>Worms Make for a Fertile Earth Science Class</HD>
<DH>Teacher's effort to make the subject matter real turns
Glendale High teenagers into enthusiastic gardeners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In teacher Michael Taylor's perfect world, every home in Glendale has
worms.</LD>
<LD>   Purplish-brown worms that eat trash and wiggle in order to breathe
through their skin and have five hearts, dual sex organs, and love to
mate in your sprinkler puddles at night.</LD>
<LD>   "They also like to mate in wet cardboard," Taylor said, before a
listener pleaded too much information.</LD>
<TE>   But there is far more than this to a worm's life, as Taylor proved
to his geoscience students this year at Glendale High School. Worms
are not just fish bait. They work the land. They recycle rubbish by
consuming and then expelling it, producing richly fertilized dirt
from which food grows.</TE>
<TE>   "Worms are nature's soil engineers," Taylor told his teenage
gardeners recently as they watered burger wrappers, cereal boxes and
other household castoffs that they feed to the Glendale High worm
colony.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't pour too much on there," one budding farmer cautions
another.</TE>
<TE>   The students built a wooden box to house their worms and grew from
seed the flourishing vegetable and herb garden outside their portable
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought was, 'This is gonna be messy,' " recalled Jarred
Sanchez, 16. "And those worms? Nasty."</TE>
<TE>   Getting out of the classroom "was still the best part," he said
with a grin, classmates around him nodding in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, Taylor's geoscience course deals in abstractions. It
starts with the universe and narrows down to the planet Earth and its
environment and then to subjects such as biogeochemical cycles and
vermicular composting.</TE>
<TE>   "Boring," said Jarred.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor knew he needed to "make the subjects more real" for his
students than "things they can't see, like methane gas." But how?</TE>
<TE>   When a construction project outside the school's chain-link fence
yielded a heap of scrap lumber, dirt and assorted junk, Taylor saw an
opportunity. Most of the elements of a garden, he said, were waiting
across the street from his classroom bungalow and free for the
taking.</TE>
<TE>   His students hauled materials to an asphalt strip outside their
bungalow. Fifteen-gallon nursery pots were donated. Seeds were
bought. Then came the lesson in nature's soil engineers.</TE>
<TE>   The students yanked nails out of the scrap lumber and hammered new
ones to build worm housing--a 4-foot-square box with legs, a lid and
bottom drainage. A glass window was installed on one side of the box
so students could observe the worms at work. A refrigerator drawer on
the ground beneath the box caught runoff water, which was used on the
plants.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Taylor sent away for five pounds of worms. Arriving by
next-day mail, the $13 purchase launched his 18 students on a course
of study as new to most of them as the soil itself. Many had never
gardened or pulled a weed.</TE>
<TE>   "Only one in six of them has a yard," Taylor said, "so I wanted to
show them that they could still grow things at home by using a
five-gallon can, some dirt and seeds."</TE>
<TE>   By early June, the students had produced protein-rich fertilizer,
which fostered 6-foot-tall high tomato plants, dangling green beans,
leafy Swiss chard, bell pepper, zucchini, cucumber, beets and aloe,
which can be used to treat burns.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomatoes were important," Taylor explained. "They are relatively
easy to grow, and the taste difference between store tomatoes and
vine-ripened tomatoes is very obvious."</TE>
<TE>   The students were so enthusiastic they gardened before and after
school and showed off their crops to other kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never forget the morning I came in and said, 'Hey, you
guys, some of your seeds have started to emerge from the soil,' "
Taylor said. "They were standing up, they were so excited, saying,
'Can't we go see now?' "</TE>
<TE>   As Taylor had hoped, the worm colony flourished. Other students
talked of starting their own potted gardens at home. The head of the
science department, Nancy Astor, wanted her own worm box.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael got us started, and me and my neighbor built it," Astor
said. "Now I'm making one for the 7-year-old down the street. Every
time I see her, she says, 'Where's my worm box?' The word is
spreading."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the students say, they understand more about
photosynthesis, life cycles and the food chain because they set those
processes in motion and learned from their mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to feed weeds to the worms," said Danny Hernandez,
16, "because they won't eat the seeds," leaving them to sprout into
more weeds.</TE>
<TE>   As the school year ended, Jarred Sanchez emerged as a worm
believer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna build my own worm box at home this summer," he said,
showing off his first tomato, a pearl-sized green one that had been
fertilized with worm castings.</TE>
<TE>   This teenager, who had tanked academically the previous year after
relocating from West Covina, found something to recharge his interest
in school, his father said. And the hands-on learning, Don Sanchez
added, has "absolutely" helped Jarred, who, said his father,
struggles with attention deficit disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one of the few classes where Jarred would come home and
say, 'Hey, Dad, we planted this today,' or 'Hey, Dad, this plant is
growing bigger,' " Sanchez said. "This was the only class where he
did that."</TE>
<TE>   Having failed almost all of his classes last year, Jarred earned
enough A's, even in core subjects such as English and math, to land
him on the honor roll this time around, his father said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous turnaround. I wrote a letter to ... the
administration on how [Taylor] was instrumental in getting Jarred to
participate."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said each student was given a variety of plants, including
jasmine, jade, Rosetta and aloe, to take home. Now that they have
learned that a garden can be grown in a mere bucket's worth of real
estate, Taylor said, he hopes his students will put their green
thumbs to work.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we grew can be done by container or balcony gardening,
and for these city kids to get their hands in the soil and feel a
part of the planet is important," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a connection as they cultivate a plant. They can see how
the planet gives back, and it cultivates an environmental ethic for
the first time," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so important for these guys to see that there is a big
planet, a big world beyond their balconies."</TE>

<HD>Albert Band, 78; Producer, Director Worked With Huston</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albert Band, 78, a producer, director and writer who frequently
collaborated with John Huston, most famously in "Red Badge of
Courage," died June 14 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The cause was complications from stomach blockage and a lung
infection.</LD>
<LD>   Band was born in Paris but fled to America with his family in
1941, just ahead of the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation of
France in World War II. He graduated from Hollywood High School and
began to develop contacts that eventually led him to Huston.</LD>
<TE>   He became Huston's assistant director on "The Asphalt Jungle," the
1950 film that starred Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern and a young
Marilyn Monroe.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, Band adapted Stephen Crane's "Red Badge of
Courage," the Civil War masterpiece about a soldier's coming of age,
into the 1951 film that starred Audie Murphy, Bill Mauldin and Andy
Devine.</TE>
<TE>   Band moved to Stockholm in 1959 and, with Europe as his base for
the next decade, worked on films such as "Face of Fire," based on
another Crane story. Band directed the movie that starred Cameron
Mitchell and James Whitmore.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Band
produced and directed movies such as "Ghoulies," "Prehysteria" and
"Trancers III" for his son Charles' independent Empire Films and
later Full Moon Films. He also was executive producer on "Honey, I
Blew Up the Kids."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen B. Nielsen, 83, an author of mysteries and scripts for such
television dramas as "Perry Mason" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"
died June 22 in Prescott, Ariz. The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Nielsen was a prolific mystery writer who tried to provide readers
with enough clues to solve the mystery on their own. Her stories were
often set in Southern California, where she lived for 60 years,
primarily in Laguna Beach and Oceanside.</LD>
<LD>   Her titles include "Woman on the Roof," "The Crime Is Murder" and
"Stranger in the Dark." Her second novel, "Gold Coast Nocturne," was
made into the movie "Blackout," a 1954 production that starred Dane
Clark. A 1959 novel, "The Fifth Caller," was adapted for television.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to her work on "Perry Mason" and "Alfred Hitchcock
Presents," Nielsen wrote scripts for "Alcoa Theatre" and "87th
Precinct."</TE>
<TE>   Before Nielsen began her writing career, she was a draftsman
during World War II and worked on the designs of B-36 and P-80
aircraft. She was born in Roseville, Ill., and studied journalism,
art and aeronautical drafting at various schools, including the
Chicago Art Institute.</TE>

<HD>Suspicious Cargo Shuts Port</HD>
<DH>Harbor: Union orders work halted for the day at the Long
Beach facility as the sheriff's bomb squad inspects the device and
finds it harmless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All work at the Port of Long Beach--a major component of the largest
harbor complex in the nation--was shut down ahead of normal closing
time Friday afternoon after a "suspicious device" was found in a
cargo container.</LD>
<LD>   A sheriff's bomb squad determined three hours later that the
device was harmless.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Police Officer W.P. Lebaron described it as "an empty
20-gallon drum, loaded inside a car, with wires leading from it, and
a flashing light on or near it."</LD>
<TE>   "It was something made to look like an alarm system, so that the
car would not be tampered with," Lebaron said.</TE>
<TE>   The International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union told its
workers to go home for the day after the device was spotted about
4:30 p.m. by a U.S. Customs agent at Berth 227 on Pier G, union
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The union order effectively shut down the port, bringing the
loading and unloading of ships to a halt. The shutdown came near the
end of the afternoon shift, and work normally is not done at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We were mandated by the ILWU headquarters in San Francisco to
close down the port," said one union official, who declined to give
his name.</TE>
<TE>   He said he could not speak further about the incident because of
ongoing contract negotiations between the union and West Coast
shippers. The contract expires Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The talks pit the ILWU, one of the nation's strongest labor
organizations, against the Pacific Maritime Assn., a powerful group
of shipping carriers and cargo distributors. The association has
threatened a lockout if the union stages a work slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials and Harbor Patrol officers said a 1980 Toyota Land
Cruiser containing the suspicious device was spotted in a container
being shipped to Russia by Maersk Sealand, the world's largest
shipping line.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Keeps Quiet on Rampart</HD>
<DH>Police: Panel investigated how the corruption scandal
occurred, sources say. Findings do not appear in year-end report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Civil Grand Jury conducted an investigation
into the Rampart corruption scandal, but the findings were not
published in the panel's annual report released Friday, according to
authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, sheriff's detectives have begun a criminal
investigation into the whereabouts of a missing set of transcripts of
statements by witnesses who were called to testify about the
corruption scandal, according to law enforcement sources familiar
with the case.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley asked the grand jury on Feb. 13 to
investigate, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district
attorney.</LD>
<TE>   "The grand jury agreed to do so. Thereafter, they conducted more
than three weeks of hearings," Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbons declined to say what Cooley wanted the grand jury to
investigate. She refused to answer further questions.</TE>
<TE>   One source familiar with the grand jury investigation said the
panel had been asked to answer the question of how the Rampart
scandal was allowed to occur. Ten current and former Rampart Division
officers have been charged in connection with the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Seven were convicted of corruption-related offenses.</TE>
<TE>   But the convictions of three were overturned, and are under appeal
by the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the criminal investigation of police misconduct,
there have been several other inquiries into the administrative and
managerial failures by Los Angeles Police Department officials that
allowed corruption in Rampart to flourish.</TE>
<TE>   The civil grand jury released its year-end report Friday, the
final day of jurors' service. While the report makes no mention of
the Rampart scandal, the document notes that at least three
high-ranking LAPD officials made presentations to the panel:
then-Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Deputy Police Chief David J.
Gascon and Capt. Sergio Diaz.</TE>

<HD>Black Leaders Promise to Battle Against Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 30 African American civic, political and religious leaders
said Friday they will campaign to stop the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood from breaking away from Los Angeles, contending that
secession would hurt black residents by reducing the clout and tax
base of the diminished city that would be left behind.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) said the
anti-secession message will be spread to black voters from churches
and union halls. The campaign will also register African Americans to
vote so they can be a force in the secession elections Nov. 5, he
said.</LD>
<LD>   "We join here together to oppose a movement to destroy this city,
to oppose a movement to split this city apart," Wesson said during a
small but spirited rally on the steps of First African Methodist
Episcopal Church in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The rally seemed to end some of the uncertainty over the role
black leaders will play in Mayor James K. Hahn's campaign against
secession. Hahn had infuriated many African Americans by opposing
Bernard Parks' bid for a second term as L.A. police chief.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was noticeably absent from the rally, but he did address
another group of African American leaders on Friday, urging them to
get involved in the anti-secession drive.</TE>
<TE>   At both events, black leaders said the Parks dispute will not stop
them from joining Hahn's effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be using secession as a revenge piece," said
A. Asadullah Samad, president of Samad and Associates and founder of
the nonprofit Urban Issues Breakfast Forum, where Hahn spoke. "It
really doesn't benefit the African American community."</TE>
<TE>   Later Friday, the pro-secession campaigns said African Americans
would not be hurt by a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the miseducation of black voters whose political power is
quickly diminishing in Los Angeles," said Geoffrey Garfield, campaign
manager for the Hollywood Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield, who is African American, said the black population of
Los Angeles would increase from 10% to 25% of the total if the Valley
and Hollywood break away.</TE>
<TE>   "In a new L.A., the voting age population of African Americans
will double, thereby doubling the political power of the African
American community in their city," Garfield said.</TE>
<TE>   The result would be increased black representation on the Los
Angeles City Council, predicted Richard Close, chairman of the
secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   But Wesson said African Americans would have greater say in a city
with fewer resources.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's six of one, half a dozen of the other, if that means
additional power or influence over a much smaller pot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson also said African American residents empathize with
secessionist complaints that the Valley and Hollywood receive
substandard city services, but added the solution is to unite and
improve Los Angeles. The legislator noted Los Angeles used its clout
as the nation's second-largest city to secure $400 million in federal
anti-poverty money a few years ago. "I don't know if they would come
up with $400 million if we were not the second-largest city," Wesson
said, adding that the city would also lose influence in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Breakup opponents also said losing the Valley tax base would harm
Los Angeles programs in their neighborhoods, and the poor would be
hurt the most.</TE>
<TE>   "A breakup of the city would cause damage in South Los Angeles,"
said Norman Johnson, director of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference's local chapter. "We are not convinced that always smaller
is better."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray of the First AME Church said, "The
drainage of people is the drainage of funds, and the chief victims of
drainage are the impoverished."</TE>
<TE>   Others who announced their opposition to secession Friday included
Geraldine Washington, president of the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People's Los Angeles chapter; Juanita Tate of
Concerned Citizens of South Central; Janett Humphries, president of
the Service Employees International Union's Local 99, which
represents school employees, and John Lett Sr., pastor of the Greater
Missionary Baptist Church in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn spoke to about 100 people at the Urban Issues Breakfast Forum
in Culver City. The crowd initially appeared cautiously open to the
mayor, then warmed to his anti-secession pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the situation between the mayor and [former] Chief
Parks and we didn't like it," said Gene Hale, president of G &amp; C
Equipment Corp. and of the Greater Los Angeles African American
Chamber of Commerce. "It doesn't mean we're not going to do our
homework on secession."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Hahn acknowledged that some in the group might be
angry toward him, but he implored them: "This isn't about me ... I
think people can disagree with each other. If this city breaks up, we
won't be able to get back together." He also warned that African
Americans would lose power if Valley and Hollywood cities are
created.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of being a major player in a big city, the African
American community will be a major player in a much smaller one,"
Hahn said. "The African American community will be left behind with
less clout in Sacramento, less clout in Washington ... We will be
left behind in a city that has been financially ruined."</TE>

<HD>Berl Senofsky, 77; Violin Virtuoso Taught at Peabody
Conservatory, Toured Widely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Berl Senofsky, a Peabody Conservatory violin virtuoso whose students
play in principal positions for major symphony orchestras, has died.
He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Senofsky died June 21 in Baltimore of complications from lung and
heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   A musical prodigy who took his first lesson at age 3, he won an
important musical award, the Queen Elisabeth International Music
Competition of Belgium, in 1955. He was a member of the Peabody
faculty from 1965 to 1996.</LD>
<TE>   "He was one of America's greatest violinists," said Stephen Kates,
a cellist and friend. "He had a natural talent and was a top
musician, pedagogue and mentor."</TE>
<TE>   Jephta Drachman, a friend, said: "He taught things you can't learn
straight out in schools. He taught the real art of playing, to play
with a meaning that penetrates deep into the heart.</TE>
<TE>   "He was generous because he cared so much about his students,"
added Drachman, president of the board of directors for Johns Hopkins
University's Shriver Hall Concert Series. "My father, [Russian-born
cellist] Gregor Piatigorsky, admired his talents tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Philadelphia, Senofsky was the son of a Russian emigre who
had studied with violinists Mischa Elman and Efrem Zimbalist.</TE>
<TE>   Senofsky studied at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and
was a pupil of master teacher Ivan Galamian.</TE>
<TE>   Senofsky received the first prize in the Walter W. Naumberg
competition in 1946 and was assistant concertmaster of the Cleveland
Orchestra from 1951 to 1955, playing under maestro George Szell.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the prestigious Belgian competition, the violinist
toured and performed widely in what was then the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   He also played in Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Senofsky founded the First Tuesday Concert Society in Baltimore;
its name later was changed to Opus One.</TE>
<TE>   "His style of performance was straight from the gut, big-bodied
and passionate. He produced a ravishing sound on the violin," said
David Starobin, a Peabody alumnus and owner of Bridge Records.
Starobin's company released a CD of a live performance Senofsky gave
in 1975 at the Library of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "To me," Senofsky said in a 1979 interview, "music is a higher
calling than just a profession or living. It is an effort in
understanding something bigger than yourself--it is an effort at
striving to be something bigger than you are. You can define religion
that way too."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Kyung Moon Ahn, died in 2000. He had two earlier
marriages, one to pianist Ellen Mack and the other to cellist Shirley
Trepel. Both ended in divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Senofsky is survived by a son, Dr. Gregory M. Senofsky of Los
Angeles; a sister, Beatrice Enson of Brooklyn, N.Y.; and a grandson.</TE>

<HD>Simi Workers Agree to Strike</HD>
<DH>Union: About 300 city clerical and technical employees
authorize an action if no progress is made in negotiations. They want
a pay raise and better benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of Simi Valley's largest public-employees union have
authorized a strike if no progress is made with city officials on
negotiations for a new contract, union leaders said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 clerical and technical workers who make up Service
Employees International Union Local 998 are seeking a pay hike and
improved health benefits in their contract, which expires Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's difficult for a city such as Simi Valley to attract and
retain the best workers when those workers can barely afford to live
in the same city in which they work," said Edgar McLemore, president
of the Simi Valley bargaining unit.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant City Manager Laura Magelnicki said she believes a strike
can be avoided, because both sides are still negotiating the terms of
a new contract. She declined to discuss the details of the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to reach an agreement with them, and we're doing the best
we can," Magelnicki said. "A strike does nobody any good, and it's
not something the city would want to see happen. We do believe they
are entitled to some settlement."</TE>
<TE>   It has been three years since this group of employees negotiated
its last contract. The last strike occurred in 1978, said Barry
Hammitt, executive director of Local 998.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Simi Valley Local 998 on average make $16 an hour,
and the union is proposing a 5% pay increase.</TE>
<TE>   Workers say that raise would put them closer to salary levels of
employees in neighboring cities. They are also seeking adjustments to
their health and retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore said an informal survey earlier this year showed that
SEIU employees in Simi Valley have salaries that average 10% to 15%
below those for employees in other cities in Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, and that they pay more than twice as much for health
insurance as management employees and police officers in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the city's management employees, who are not
unionized, were just granted a 3% pay hike.</TE>
<TE>   "While we don't begrudge anyone their fair share, we do feel it's
our turn now," McLemore said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammitt said the bargaining unit has not decided how long it is
willing to wait for a settlement before calling for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting between the union and the city is scheduled for
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The employees are sending a message to the City Council that they
are bound and determined to get fair and just treatment," Hammitt
said. "If they don't, [the workers are] willing to withhold their

<HD>Tears, Cheers, the Latest Research for Stutterers at O.C.
Conference</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would be a simple speech for many was filled with landmines for
Kevin Murphy, a gangly college student from Boise, Idaho.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems like it was yesterday that I first sat in this
workshop," Murphy told a packed ballroom Friday afternoon--fighting
through "seems" and "yesterday," wrestling with "sat" and stumbling
over "this."</LD>
<LD>   For once, there were no nasty snickers or uncomfortable stares
when he spoke. Only warm smiles, on his face and nearly a hundred
others.</LD>
<TE>   Murphy joined nearly 500 others in Anaheim this weekend for the
National Stuttering Assn.'s annual conference, a three-day gathering
of parents, therapists and stutterers of every race and ethnicity
seeking camaraderie, support and news on the latest research.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of each morning is the "open microphone," when
stutterers step before a packed house and mow down the granddaddy of
all fears: public speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of tears and cheers," said Jim McClure, a public
relations consultant from Chicago who has come to the conferences for
more than a decade. "It's just a real high to meet people just like
you. They've been through it all; they have the same fears. You come
here and realize--'Hey, I'm not crazy.' "</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 1% of Americans stutter and, along with dealing with
occasional tormentors and their own insecurities, many must overcome
common misconceptions that stuttering is attributed to stupidity,
nervousness or some mental disorder. Or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was told by our pediatrician I stuttered because she
stopped breastfeeding too soon," said Annie Bradberry, the
association's executive director. "She walked around for years
thinking that she was to blame."</TE>
<TE>   The association has been struggling to eradicate such speculation
by educating the public, especially the medical community and the
parents of children who stutter, Bradberry said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a difficult task because health care grants and federal
funding for research and education are funneled toward disorders that
are more common or better known. Insurance rarely covers the cost of
speech therapy. Although therapy is provided in most public school
systems, many of the therapists have no experience or training in
stuttering, said Joe Donaher, coordinator of the stuttering program
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers theorize that stuttering springs from multiple causes,
ranging from brain chemistry to heredity to environmental factors.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no 100%-agreed-upon cause for stuttering," Donaher said.
"There's so much involved in speech--cognition, emotion--it can be
disrupted in a variety of ways."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest danger is to ignore it, Donaher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even today we have pediatricians telling parents, don't worry,
the kid will grow out of it," Donaher said. "Early intervention is
critical. The longer you let a child struggle with it, the more
involved it may become."</TE>
<TE>   People who stutter learn to cope by avoiding words that trip them
up or skirting high-pressure situations, from simple telephone
conversations to job interviews. Those bad habits become more and
more difficult to untangle as stutterers grow into adulthood, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Stephanie Nicolai started at a new junior high school in
Ontario, she begged her teachers not to call on her in class or force
her to read aloud--at least until she had time to adjust. When other
students became jealous, unaware she stuttered, she wrote a paper on
her stuttering and read it aloud in English class.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is perfect. This is just my imperfection," said Stephanie,
13, who sports the braces and fashion of a typical teenager. "People
used to tease me about it, but now most people understand I'm not
doing it on purpose."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie attended her first conference for people who stutter two
years ago, and she said it was the first time she began to accept her
affliction and not let it define her.</TE>
<TE>   People nearly always begin stuttering between the ages of 2 and 4.
About 60% of children outgrow it by puberty, suggesting an
association with brain development. The disorder affects four times
as many males as females.</TE>
<TE>   Innovations in therapy and medicine are providing new hope.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Irvine, psychiatry professor Dr. Gerald Maguire has been a
pioneer in searching the brain for the sources of stuttering and in
using drugs to control the disorder.</TE>
<TE>   He performed the first brain scans on stutterers. They showed that
when levels of the chemical dopamine were reduced through drug
therapy, activity in a deep portion of the brain increased and
stuttering decreased.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to say this is the end-all in stuttering research," Maguire
said. "Not all treatments work for all people.... We need to look at
a variety of approaches."</TE>
<TE>   That includes both medicine and speech therapy, and especially the
two used together, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The increased emphasis on stuttering therapy and research is a
marked change from when Randy Hoover attended grammar school in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, I don't think they knew what to do with us," said
Hoover, a mechanical engineer for Boeing who lives in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover put off speech therapy for years until an incident at work.
Working for Rockwell, he was talking to a vendor on the telephone
when he got caught on the word "Rockwell," causing a long silence.
The vendor hung up on him.</TE>
<TE>   He went to a speech therapist that month. In 1998, at a National
Stuttering Assn. convention in Atlanta, Hoover appeared on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cool. I stuttered. I didn't care."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Wants Fall Traffic Initiative Declared Invalid</HD>
<DH>Development: The city petitions an appellate court in an
effort to remove the ballot measure, contending its provisions
discriminate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attorneys for the city of Ojai have filed a request with a state
appellate court that seeks to have a traffic initiative slated for
the November ballot declared invalid.</LD>
<LD>   Called an original writ, the request was filed this week with the
2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura. The writ seeks to
essentially overturn a lower court's ruling that placed the measure
on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe [the initiative] discriminates against affordable
housing and people who need affordable housing," said attorney
Katherine Stone, who represents the city in the action.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is an initiative that would give voters--rather than the
Ojai City Council--the right to approve or reject development
projects that would increase traffic on local roadways.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stone, the measure essentially places a 20-year
moratorium on all construction projects that would affect traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The sole exception, she said, would be pricey, custom,
single-family houses. Projects such as schools, fire stations,
hospitals and jails could not immediately be built either, Stone
said.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly alarming, Stone said, would be a halt to the upgrades
and expansion of the Ojai Valley Inn, a primary source of tax revenue
for the city.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative was crafted and proposed by Citizens to Preserve
the Ojai. Organization representatives strongly dispute the claim
that the initiative is discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Neiswender, a representative for the organization, has said
the initiative simply requires developers of new projects to prepare
mitigation measures that would ensure traffic increases do not occur.</TE>
<TE>   "Development within the City of Ojai and surrounding
unincorporated areas should not be permitted to proceed at a rate
which overwhelms the road system and produces unacceptable traffic
congestion, with attendant air pollution and degradation of the
quality of life," the group's notice on the initiative states.</TE>
<TE>   After supporters gathered enough signatures to place the
initiative on the ballot, the city sued, contending the measure is
confusing and would mislead voters and prohibit the city from
providing affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   In early June, Superior Court Judge Henry J. Walsh ruled the
measure should appear on the ballot because the court had no "grave"
doubts about its validity, which the judge used as a standard to
decide.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of filing an appeal, Stone said the city decided on the
writ. Filed at the appellate court along with the writ are several
letters in support of the city's position, including one from the
Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. and the cities of Thousand Oaks
and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   An appellate judge has several options, including denying the
request, issuing an order or requesting more information from the
citizens' committee, Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   If the request is denied and the measure remains on the ballot,
Stone said the city would consider a post-election challenge if the
initiative passes. Similar measures in Newport Beach and Walnut Creek
in the 1980s failed.</TE>
<TE>   The growth issue is nothing new to Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Census data show the city, with 7,862 residents, grew by only 3%
between 1990 and 2000. Neighboring communities with less expensive
real estate grew by 13% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Only three new housing projects, totaling 68 units, have been
approved by the city since 1993.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Manson Follower Loses 14th Parole Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state parole panel Friday refused to free former Charles Manson
follower Leslie Van Houten from prison, deciding that she has not
served enough time for two "cruel and calculated" 1969 murders in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the 14th time Van Houten, now 52, has been denied parole
for killing Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their Los Feliz home,
murders that capped a two-day, Manson-led crime rampage that
terrified Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   After an emotional three-hour hearing in Frontera and an
additional 90 minutes of deliberations, the two-member Board of
Prison Terms panel praised Van Houten for her excellent disciplinary
record and for taking self-help classes behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   But panel Chairwoman Sharon Lawin said such accomplishments are
outweighed by other factors, among them Van Houten's need for
"continued therapy to further understand the enormity of the crime
and its impacts on the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Lawin said Van Houten would pose "an unreasonable risk of danger
to society" if released.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten appeared frustrated by the panel's conclusion, saying
that the California Institution for Women where she is incarcerated
near Corona no longer provides inmates with access to regular
psychotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "You just recommended something that they don't offer," she said.
"But I will do what I can."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's decision came just weeks after a Superior Court judge in
San Bernardino sharply rebuked the parole board for repeatedly
rejecting parole for Van Houten based solely on the severity of her
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Bob N. Krug said the board had ignored Van Houten's
exemplary prison record and acted in an "arbitrary and capricious"
manner in deciding that she remains a threat to public safety.</TE>
<TE>   That rebuke had buoyed the hopes of Van Houten's supporters, who
sent 44 letters to the parole board urging that she be freed. But the
state plans to appeal Krug's decision, and on Friday, Lawin took
pains to detail the panel's qualms about Van Houten's psychiatric
reports and other factors in rejecting her parole.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's attorney, Christie Webb, said she and her client were
deeply disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to be a 52-year-old woman, a decent person,
and to be treated in that room like the 19-year-old cult victim she
was," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that she is not sure what to advise her client as she
prepares for her next parole hearing. "What can she do? They are
asking her, again, to do therapy that is not available."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the victims were delighted by the panel's action,
saying Van Houten should atone for her crime by spending the rest of
her life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never happy about a young girl getting duped and getting
caught up in something like this," said Angela Smaldino, a niece of
the LaBiancas who spoke at the hearing. "But she did what she did."</TE>
<TE>   Smaldino's brother, Louis, was near tears when he addressed the
hearing. "Miss Van Houten should already be dead for her part in
these unprovoked murders," he said. "Society has been very merciful."</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a gray T-shirt and prison jeans, her hands shackled at
the waist and her graying hair in a bun, Van Houten sat calmly
throughout the proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Her voice cracked as she told the board how she struggles with
shame and sorrow caused by her role in the murders--and her inability
to ever make things right.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult thing to live with what I did at age 19 and
be able to carry myself with any dignity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten, a former homecoming princess from Monrovia, became
alienated from her family as a teenager and said she was introduced
to Manson by a boyfriend. She said she came to view Manson as Jesus
Christ and believed in his bizarre plan to commit murders and blame
African Americans in hopes of sparking a race war.</TE>
<TE>   "My loyalty to him, my need to please him, made me want to"
participate in the LaBianca murders, she told the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm deeply ashamed of it," she said. "I take very seriously not
just the murders but what made me make myself available to someone
like Manson."</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten has been characterized by supporters as the least
culpable member of the so-called Manson family. She did not take part
in the killings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate or four others at
Tate's rented Benedict Canyon home.</TE>
<TE>   She did, however, willingly join Manson and others the following
night when they invaded the LaBianca home, picked at random. She held
down Rosemary LaBianca while she was stabbed by an accomplice and,
when told to "do something" by cohort Charles "Tex" Watson, she
stabbed the woman about 14 times in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Kay told the board
that such "vicious" acts make parole for Van Houten at any time
unwise. Kay, who took part in four of the Manson trials, has attended
all 58 parole hearings for each of the five imprisoned murderers.</TE>
<TE>   After presenting the board with a lengthy, detailed recounting of
the crime, Kay said: "Can you ever really have confidence that
someone who ... would murder two innocent strangers in the sanctity
of their own home would never not pose an unreasonable risk of danger
to society?"</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's attorney, however, argued that her client had been
under the influence of Manson's brainwashing. Drawing parallels with
the mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana, and other episodes in which
cult followers committed horrifying deeds, Webb said Van Houten was
convinced that obeying Manson's orders was the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Webb also urged the board to look beyond the gravity of the crime
and consider her client's progress in prison, from her sewing of
quilts for the homeless to her excellent evaluations for her work as
a clerk in the prison's Catholic chapel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine that any inmate could present a better
picture than she does," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, commissioners paid particular attention to
evaluations conducted by prison psychiatrists, most recently in May.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Dr. Robert McDaniel said Van Houten would pose a
low risk to society if she were released. But he also referred to
past reports in which he had cited her tendency to get drawn into
destructive relationships, such as the Manson cult--a tendency he
said would fade over time.</TE>
<TE>   Lawin, in outlining the panel's decision, said that element of her
psychiatric profile had figured substantially in the denial of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "The panel concludes these risk factors of future dangerousness
still exist to some degree," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Van Houten, Manson, Watson and two other
women--Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel--were convicted and
sentenced to death for their part in the Tate-LaBianca murders.</TE>
<TE>   The sentences were later commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down the death penalty in the 1970s. All are still
behind bars.</TE>

<TE>   "My loyalty to him, my need to please him, made me want to"
participate in the LaBianca murders, she told the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm deeply ashamed of it," she said. "I take very seriously not
just the murders but what made me make myself available to someone
like Manson."</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten has been characterized by supporters as the least
culpable member of the so-called Manson family. She did not take part
in the killings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate or four others at
Tate's rented Benedict Canyon home.</TE>
<TE>   She did, however, willingly join Manson and others the following
night when they invaded the LaBianca home, picked at random. She held
down Rosemary LaBianca while she was stabbed by an accomplice and,
when told to "do something" by cohort Charles "Tex" Watson, she
stabbed the woman about 14 times in the back.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Kay told the board
that such "vicious" acts make parole for Van Houten at any time
unwise. Kay, who took part in four of the Manson trials, has attended
all 58 parole hearings for each of the five imprisoned murderers.</TE>
<TE>   After presenting the board with a lengthy, detailed recounting of
the crime, Kay said: "Can you ever really have confidence that
someone who ... would murder two innocent strangers in the sanctity
of their own home would never not pose an unreasonable risk of danger
to society?"</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten's attorney, however, argued that her client had been
under the influence of Manson's brainwashing. Drawing parallels with
the mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana, and other episodes in which
cult followers committed horrifying deeds, Webb said Van Houten was
convinced that obeying Manson's orders was the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Webb also urged the board to look beyond the gravity of the crime
and consider her client's progress in prison, from her sewing of
quilts for the homeless to her excellent evaluations for her work as
a clerk in the prison's Catholic chapel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine that any inmate could present a better
picture than she does," Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, commissioners paid particular attention to
evaluations conducted by prison psychiatrists, most recently in May.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, Dr. Robert McDaniel said Van Houten would pose a
low risk to society if she were released. But he also referred to
past reports in which he had cited her tendency to get drawn into
destructive relationships, such as the Manson cult--a tendency he
said would fade over time.</TE>
<TE>   Lawin, in outlining the panel's decision, said that element of her
psychiatric profile had figured substantially in the denial of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   "The panel concludes these risk factors of future dangerousness
still exist to some degree," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Van Houten, Manson, Watson and two other
women--Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel--were convicted and
sentenced to death for their part in the Tate-LaBianca murders.</TE>
<TE>   The sentences were later commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme
Court struck down the death penalty in the 1970s. All are still
behind bars.</TE>

<LD>City fire officials have announced they would consolidate the
department's fire and rescue dispatch operations with those of the
Ventura County Fire Protection District.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, the county fire district will provide
emergency dispatch services for Santa Paula, while the city's
department will help the county respond to incidents in nearby
unincorporated areas.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Paula had used its dispatchers to handle police and fire
calls, which affected the quality of emergency service, said Jerry
Byrum, acting assistant fire chief.</LD>
<TE>   The new joint dispatch service "is a win-win situation for
everybody," Byrum said, adding that he would like to see more
cooperation between the city and county.</TE>
<TE>   No jobs were lost in the consolidation. Byrum said Santa Paula's
dispatchers will continue to handle local police calls.</TE>
<TE>   The consolidation takes effect July 10, leaving Oxnard as the only
city in the county that has not consolidated its fire dispatch
services with the county.</TE>

<HD>Tapes by Virk Accuse Her Husband of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Trial: Woman who allegedly tried to drown her two children
made anguished audio recordings about alleged beatings and death
threats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before she allegedly tried to drown her children, a distraught Port
Hueneme mother recorded five audio tapes in which she documented
alleged spousal abuse and death threats by her then-husband.</LD>
<LD>   Transcripts of those recordings were presented as evidence Friday
in the Ventura County Superior Court trial of 42-year-old Narinder
Virk.</LD>
<LD>   On the recordings, Virk says in her native language, Punjabi, that
her husband beat her daily and threatened to kill her.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes he gets after me with the knife, sometimes he beats me
with the stick," she says, according to the transcripts. "I don't
know when he is going to finish me."</TE>
<TE>   Virk, an Indian immigrant who cannot read or write, goes on to say
that Santokh Virk threatened to kill her and throw her body in the
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The couple divorced after she allegedly tried to drown their son
and daughter, then ages 9 and 6, in Channel Islands Harbor on Jan.
12, 2000. Virk faces two counts of attempted murder and has pleaded
not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   The translated tape-recordings were presented by the prosecution
as evidence of Virk's alleged plan to kill her children. But they
also support the defense theory that Virk was a battered wife who
suffered a mental breakdown after years of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The tapes, none of which are dated, were discovered by police
after the alleged drowning attempt. Four were found in a black duffel
bag at the Virks' apartment and one was found in a storm drain near
the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   The tape in the storm drain was thrown there by Virk as she walked
her children to the water's edge that night, according to the
testimony of her son, Sonny, who later led police to the site.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that recording, the shortest of the five,
contains evidence of Virk's intention to kill her children that night
to punish her allegedly abusive and adulterous husband.</TE>
<TE>   "You will not talk with children, neither with son nor with
daughter," she says, according to the transcripts. "Now you will be
only talking with these cassettes."</TE>
<TE>   According to the transcripts, Virk goes on to say, "No one is
going to take you[r] income, neither your son nor your daughter. This
income you have only dogs are going to eat it."</TE>
<TE>   On the other tapes, Virk accuses her husband of beating her daily,
once with a rolling pin. Transcripts show she also accused him of
having affairs with two women, filing false insurance claims over a
fake car accident and keeping her trapped in their apartment.</TE>
<TE>   During two days of testimony this week, Santokh Virk denied all of
those accusations when confronted by Narinder Virk's attorney. He
told jurors that he never beat his wife.</TE>
<TE>   In the transcripts, Virk's words ramble in long, emotional
sentences. She appears angry, desperate and paranoid, stating more
than once, "He wants to kill me ... I am recording these tapes so
that after my death he cannot say that I committed suicide."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she states that the situation makes her feel "like a
lunatic."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors read through the lengthy transcripts for several hours
Friday before defense attorney Cynthia Ellington called her first
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Two teachers testified that they never observed signs of abuse on
the Virk children. Sonny and his sister, Harpreet, testified that
their mother hit them.</TE>
<TE>   A former Port Hueneme police officer also testified that on three
occasions he was called to the Virks' apartment, once for an alleged
domestic dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Paradis, who recently retired, told jurors that Santokh
Virk appeared to have been drinking prior to one call in April 1999.
But he observed no signs of physical abuse to Narinder Virk, and he
and his partner left the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Paradis testified that two months earlier, he had gone to the same
residence after a neighbor reported that Santokh Virk had left for
India and abandoned his family. Paradis said he observed no food in
the house, only a container of milk. He said Narinder Virk was crying
and appeared fearful of her husband.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Paradis acknowledged that he never filed a
criminal report or child neglect report with the Department of Social
Services about the visit. Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>2 Major Water Projects Might Dry Up</HD>
<DH>Resources: Fears for environment imperil desert plan. Sale
to San Diego County also appears shaky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two proposed big-ticket water projects meant to prevent Southern
California from suffering severe shortages appear increasingly in
doubt over questions of money and the environment despite years of
planning and debate.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, a U.S. Senate committee passed a bill that included a
provision inserted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that, in
effect, could kill a 50-year plan to pump water from beneath the
Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   And on Friday, the governing board of the water-rich Imperial
Irrigation District made clear its lack of enthusiasm for a proposed
75-year sale of water to San Diego County. A move is afoot on the
board to back out of the sale.</LD>
<TE>   The Mojave Desert and Imperial Valley projects are seen by water
officials in Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego as crucial to the
state's ability to offset a threatened reduction of its allocation
from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bleak water future may be here quicker than anyone thought,"
said Steve Erie, a political science professor and water expert at UC
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the water distributed by the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California to 17 million people in six counties
comes from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   California is under increasing pressure from the federal
government to reduce its reliance on the river by finding new sources
and by arranging sales of water from farms to cities.</TE>
<TE>   For several years California has been taking water that rightfully
belongs to other states, and now those states want the federal
government to clamp down on their thirsty neighbor to the west.</TE>
<TE>   But water issues are never solved easily or quickly, even with the
state facing a Jan. 1 deadline to find alternative sources or face a
cutback from the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Feinstein provision would prevent the Department of Interior
from spending any money on a proposed deal between the MWD and Santa
Monica-based Cadiz Inc. for use of an aquifer beneath land owned by
Cadiz in eastern San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein agrees with environmentalists, ranchers and staff of the
U.S. Geological Survey that the project could deplete the aquifer and
harm the fragile desert environment--an assertion disputed by the
Bureau of Land Management and by scientists working for Cadiz.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department is studying the project. Cadiz has hired
the former law firm of Interior Secretary Gale Norton to lobby the
Interior Department on behalf of the project.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Norton, Feinstein has suggested limiting the amount
of "indigenous" water that can be pumped from the aquifer to 5,000
acre-feet a year. The proposed deal between the MWD and Cadiz
envisions pumping six times that amount. An acre-foot is about
326,000 gallons--the volume necessary to meet the needs of two
families for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're frustrated that our project has been through five years of
environmental review, and now something like this comes up at the
last moment," said Cadiz spokeswoman Wendy Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   She declined to say whether the company would still consider the
project economically viable if pumping was limited to 5,000
acre-feet.</TE>
<TE>   MWD executive Adan Ortega called the Feinstein provision "just
another bump in the road. We've grown used to seeing things pop up
that we didn't anticipate."</TE>
<TE>   Ortega noted that the House version of the Interior Department
appropriation bill does not include a similar provision, and thus, if
the full Senate adopts Feinstein's provision, there would have to be
negotiations between the two legislative bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed deal, the MWD would store "excess" water from
the Colorado River in the aquifer. During dry years, that water and
the "indigenous" water would be pumped out for use in the six
counties that depend on the MWD. The storage plan would require
construction of a spur from the MWD's Colorado Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's provision would bar the Interior Department from
issuing a right-of-way over government land for such a spur.</TE>
<TE>   She agrees with environmentalists who do not trust the monitoring
system devised by Cadiz and the MWD to determine the rate at which
the aquifer is being depleted. The water agency has agreed that
pumping would be immediately shut down if the water level was
dropping faster than predicted.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is an arcane scientific debate over how quickly the
desert aquifer is replenished by snow melting in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than relying on a monitoring plan that has never been used
before to prevent overdrawing the aquifer, why not limit the project
... ?" Feinstein wrote Norton.</TE>
<TE>   Even as officials in Washington and Los Angeles and
environmentalists pondered the effect of Feinstein's provision,
another water issue was being hotly discussed in the Imperial Valley
town of El Centro.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District governing body voted 4 to 1 to
accept an environmental report on the proposed sale of water to San
Diego County, but only after a clause was written to establish that
accepting the report does not mean the board approves of the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our next step will be to find a way to terminate the
[sale] agreement," said board member Andy Horne.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairwoman Stella Mendoza is so opposed to the sale that she
voted against accepting the environmental report.</TE>
<TE>   Horne, Mendoza and others are worried that, to save water,
Imperial Valley farmers will be forced to leave fallow portions of
their fields, which could have a severe economic effect on a county
where agriculture is the top industry.</TE>
<TE>   They are also concerned that $1 billion of the proceeds from
selling their water to San Diego would have to go to offset decreased
flows to the Salton Sea. The inland body of water, straddling
Imperial and Riverside counties, depends on agricultural runoff,
which would be reduced by the water sale.</TE>

<HD>Work to Begin in 4 O.C. Cities to Silence Trains by
Lowering Tracks</HD>
<DH>Noise: The $440-million project will get underway Tuesday
in Placentia. But relief for residents weary of the frequent warnings
is still years away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Placentia residents plagued by blaring train whistles hope that work
starting next week will give them relief--and improve traffic flow at
the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The $440-million OnTrac project, which will eventually include
Anaheim, Fullerton and Yorba Linda, will lower the tracks by as much
as 40 feet so street traffic can go over passenger and freight
trains, rather than stop for them. Besides eliminating a potential
traffic hazard and easing congestion, the project will mean that
train crews won't have to blow their whistles as they approach
intersections.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a No. 1 issue for the staff here and the entire
community," said Kristin Gundel, a management analyst for Placentia.
"People are constantly calling us and e-mailing us about the noise,
because they cannot rest."</LD>
<TE>   Work on the five-mile project, which will include 11 railroad
crossings, will begin Tuesday at Melrose Street and Bradford and
Placentia avenues. That phase is scheduled to be completed by 2005.
All 11 crossings should be finished within seven years, said Chris
Becker, Placentia's director of public works.</TE>
<TE>   Citing safety concerns, Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.

<HD>Riding Whistles Out on a Rail</HD>
<DH>Noise: A $440-million track lowering in four cities will
reduce need for train warnings. But project will take years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Placentia residents plagued by blaring train whistles hope that work
starting next week will give them relief--and improve traffic flow at
the same time.</LD>
<LD>   The $440-million OnTrac project, which will eventually include
Anaheim, Fullerton and Yorba Linda, will lower the tracks by as much
as 40 feet so street traffic can go over passenger and freight
trains, rather than stop for them. Besides eliminating a potential
traffic hazard and easing congestion, the project will mean that
train crews won't have to blow their whistles as they approach
intersections.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a No. 1 issue for the staff here and the entire
community," said Kristin Gundel, a management analyst for Placentia.
"People are constantly calling us and e-mailing us about the noise,
because they cannot rest."</LD>
<TE>   Work on the five-mile project will begin Tuesday at Melrose Street
and Bradford and Placentia avenues. That phase is scheduled to be
completed by 2005. All 11 crossings in the project should be finished
within seven years, said Chris Becker, Placentia's director of public
works.</TE>
<TE>   Citing safety concerns, Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.
in early 2000 resumed using horns on freight trains for the first
time in 25 years. Placentia officials sued to stop the practice
except in emergencies, but a judge denied the request, saying the
court could not issue a ruling that might expose the rail line to
liability.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 Burlington Northern-Santa Fe trains pass through
Placentia daily. OnTrac was formed in April 2000 as a joint-powers
venture among the four cities. Placentia has about $28 million in
federal funds for its part of the underpass project. The rest of the
money is coming from the state, the Orange County Transportation
Authority and the rail company.</TE>
<TE>   "The noise of the trains has really become a nuisance," resident
John Cullum said. "There is a noise restriction, but you get an
occasional engineer who thinks that he has the prerogative to blow
the whistle whenever he wants to."</TE>
<TE>   Burlington Northern spokeswoman Lena Kent in San Bernardino said
that although lowering the tracks may reduce traffic congestion and
noise in residential areas, safety is still the primary concern.</TE>
<TE>   "Our engineers must always have the discretion to blow the
whistle," she said. "We always have to do what's necessary to
maintain safety measures."</TE>

<HD>Jury Duty Need Not Be a Trial</HD>
<DH>Court is trying to be more aware of the human relations
factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES A. BASCUE</AU>
<BD>James A. Bascue is presiding judge of the Los Angeles
Superior Court.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you list all of the ways to spend your time away from work, jury
service is not likely to be among your favorites. In fact, when your
jury summons arrives, you may start plotting how to be excused.
Failing that, you may try to postpone it, hoping the court will
forget about you.</LD>
<LD>   Courts themselves have brought on some of this reluctance. We
judges and other court officers haven't been as sensitive as we could
be to the realities of modern life. People simply don't have two
weeks to sit in a jury assembly room waiting to be called.</LD>
<LD>   And we haven't handled the human relations part of jury service as
effectively as we could.</LD>
<TE>   For example, we insisted that you appear at the courthouse, taking
days or weeks from your schedule, and then you simply sat around.
More than we would have liked, we let you cool your heels outside a
courtroom, waiting to be interviewed for jury placement. We often
didn't bother to tell you when attorneys were negotiating to settle
the case, and that you might not be needed.</TE>
<TE>   At times, we left you sitting in a jury room for long periods
while attorneys argued motions that were decided solely by the judge.
We sometimes left you in the dark about what was happening. We barred
you from taking notes. In short, we understand your
indifference--possibly your hostility--when the jury summons arrives
in your mailbox.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the Los Angeles Superior Court began implementing a
system called "one day, one trial." Its use was made mandatory in
California starting in 1998, and in mid-June we finished taking this
program countywide.</TE>
<TE>   In this system, you are required to call in daily for one week and
be prepared to report the following day for jury duty. On that one
day, you may actually be seated on a jury. Most trials last a week or
less. If you are not selected, your jury service is completed on that
day.</TE>
<TE>   Our court system requires 10,000 jurors a day. Simple math shows
that unless excuses from jury service are minimized, we would exhaust
the 6.1-million-person Los Angeles County jury pool in less than a
year. So we are paying much more attention to people who refuse to
respond to our summonses. While some may see this as enforcement, we
look at it as assuring equity in jury service.</TE>
<TE>   To make jury duty more truly equitable, we've broadened the
categories of people who can expect to be called to jury duty. We
routinely refuse to excuse elected officials, celebrities or
prominent members of the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   Our judges are urged to put jurors first when deciding how to run
their courtrooms. We have asked them, for example, to hold off
calling for potential jurors until 20 minutes or less before they are
needed inside the courtroom. We have also asked judges to more
realistically estimate how many jurors they will need and when they
will need them. We are working to persuade all employers to pay
workers when they serve on juries. We are reminding lawyers--as well
as our own judges--to respect jurors' time and dignity.</TE>
<TE>   It would be foolish to declare victory--yet, anyway. Our research
finds, however, that the 10% of jurors who participate in a trial
almost always find the experience deeply rewarding. Our hope for the
other 90% is that they leave our jury assembly rooms knowing they
were treated well.</TE>

<HD>For Quality Schools, Start Thinking Small</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM SHUFORD</AU>
<BD>Tom Shuford, a retired teacher, lives in Ventura
County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New construction to relieve overcrowding, end forced busing and
return children to neighborhood schools is in the offing for Los
Angeles schools if Supt. Roy Romer gets his $3.3-billion school bond
proposal before voters in November. And, of course, if voters accept
it. Not an easy hurdle, given the troubles of L.A. schools and the
presence of a statewide school bond on the same ballot.</LD>
<LD>   One way to sell the local bond issue: earmark a portion for school
size reduction.</LD>
<LD>   Background: Experts have been urging school consolidation since
the late 19th century. The Cold War gave impetus to the trend. The
"struggle between the free nations and Communism," wrote Harvard
University President James B. Conant, requires "democratic unity" and
high scores on science tests. These goals would be best achieved, he
thought, with large schools. As a result, the average school
population is five times that of 50 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, size has unintended consequences. According to Paul
Houston, executive director of the American Assn. of School
Administrators: "A recent study [a survey of more than 100 research
reports] from the Northwest Regional Laboratory in Portland, Ore.,
shows that small schools are superior to large ones on almost every
measure."</TE>
<TE>   In April, The Times reported results from the latest such study.
University of Minnesota researchers surveyed 90,000 students at 132
schools across the country. Findings: Big campuses "foster more
alienation, drug use and risky behavior. Students often feel less
attached to those campuses and less comfortable around peers and
school staff."</TE>
<TE>   What about large schools' "economies of scale"? A myth, according
to Houston: "One of the reasons such a large portion of the per-pupil
expenditures in America does not touch the classroom is because there
is too much of everything. Large size requires more monitoring and
more record-keeping which requires more people and greater
expenditures." The large-school edge in advanced courses, moreover,
is eroding. Quality online courses are available and expanding.</TE>
<TE>   Small schools mean more choices. It would be easier to specialize
by curriculum, location (perhaps near parents' workplaces) and
philosophy (traditional, progressive).</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen like-minded veteran teachers could run a small
school. Energized by a shared vision of the kind of school they would
like to create, and with students whose families buy into that
vision--that is, choose them--they could pay themselves well, have
ample funds for other expenses and teach smaller classes.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers are already running small public schools. Minnesota New
Country School is a 125-student charter school in Henderson, Minn.,
one of seven facilities run by a teachers cooperative of 100
instructors and 45 other education professionals, under contract with
school boards. In California, the state education code, particularly
the building codes for schools, would have to be modified to allow
this. But nothing is impossible.</TE>
<TE>   A cooperative public school is just one possibility. Whatever
their form, small schools have a "return on investment" for students
and their families that is too attractive to ignore. As the L.A.
district ponders plans for the bond funds, outsized good may come
from thinking small.</TE>

<LD>Sound financial advice doesn't change much from year to year. Bad
money management ideas, however, seem to flourish and grow with each
passing season.</LD>
<LD>   "Ultimately it's up to you to resist bad advice and protect your
own financial future," says CNBC on MSN Money, personal-finance
columnist Liz Pulliam Weston.</LD>
<LD>   Weston has outlined three of today's most common money moves often
considered to be sound financial advice, that can actually end up
putting consumers even further in debt:</LD>
<TE>   * Use a home equity loan to pay off credit-card debt? While some
lenders tout home equity loans as a way to pay off credit cards, the
only way this maneuver really helps, is if you stop using your credit
cards completely. Nearly two-thirds of the people who borrowed
against their home equity between 1996 and 1998 to pay off credit
card debt, had run up more debt within two years. By borrowing more
against your home, you whittle away the amount of equity available in
case of an emergency and ensure that you continue to pay hundreds or
thousands of dollars a year in interest to your lender.</TE>
<TE>   * Borrow from your 401(k)? Eighty-three percent of American
workers covered by 401(k) plans can borrow against their accounts,
and about one in five participants has an outstanding loan as a
result of doing so. People who borrow from their workplace retirement
funds can be putting their retirement at risk. If they lose their
jobs, the loan must be repaid, typically within weeks. If not, the
loan balance can be taxed and penalized as a premature distribution.
Like home equity, retirement funds are best left alone to grow -- and
to be there for you when you need it.</TE>
<TE>   * Stretch to buy a house? It may seem tempting to buy the biggest
and the best home possible, but anyone who has been house-poor knows
the emotional, psychological, and financial stress of stretching too
far. Buying too much home could mean giving up other things you want
or it can mean more debt, as you borrow to try to maintain your
lifestyle. Homeowners should also plan on spending at least one
percent of their homes' value on maintenance and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   To find out more about how to manage your money and make smarter
financial decisions, check with your your local accountant or money
advisor. Some software programs, offer tools and features designed to
help manage and eliminate credit-card debt while planning and
budgeting for the future.</TE>

<HD>Breakdown Seen in Audit Oversight</HD>
<DH>Accounting: As reports of bookkeeping irregularities mount,
many observers are asking why checks and balances did not work.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Xerox Corp. became the latest company to play corporate America's
"Who's Cooking the Books?" game Friday, investors are asking what has
happened to the auditors, board members and other watchdogs of the
nation's corporations.</LD>
<LD>   Xerox said Friday that it improperly reported $6.4 billion in
revenue over a five-year period by prematurely booking revenue from
some sales and leases. On Tuesday, WorldCom Inc., the nation's
second-largest long-distance telephone company, admitted that it
wrongly booked $3.9 billion in routine expenses as capital
expenditures over the last five quarters, greatly inflating its
income.</LD>
<LD>   Both of these cases and multiple other financial scandals over the
last year required the participation of a corporation's chief
financial officer and usually the senior executives to alter the
books or to hide important information. But seldom is knowledge of
improper accounting limited solely to one or two individuals who
orchestrate the scheme.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is whether underlings will jeopardize their careers to
blow the whistle on top executives and whether outside accountants
will risk losing clients by objecting to questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to worry when the chief executive and the audit
committee of a company's board of directors give the chief financial
officer so much power," said Lynn Turner, former chief accountant at
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "The CFO can create a culture where people who challenge him for
doing wrong will end their careers," said Turner, who heads the
Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting experts say it is possible but unlikely that WorldCom
CFO Scott D. Sullivan acted unilaterally when he booked $3.9 billion
of ordinary expenses as capital expenditures, actions that now make
him a target of a Securities and Exchange Commission probe.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big enough number so that more people than just the CFO
had to know," said John C. Coffee Jr., a white-collar crime and
securities expert at Columbia University's law school.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, Sullivan could have directed staff to log the
expenditures into the company's accounting and then made the final
decision to mark them as capital expenditures as he compiled the
balance sheet and financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's likely that at least one other person and possibly
more were aware of the improper accounting and either participated or
chose not to challenge it, accounting experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Muller, the former chief executive of Edison Mission Energy and
an audit committee member on the boards of two public companies, is
not surprised that board members missed the incorrect accounting
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "An audit committee meets four or five times a year," Muller said.
"They discuss the major issues raised by management, the outside and
the internal auditors, but they are not making entries or poring
through the books. The big problem is that the perpetrators were the
staff."</TE>
<TE>   The error was discovered only after John W. Sidgmore, who replaced
longtime WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers in April, asked
an internal auditor to conduct a special review of the company's
books. Coffee said Arthur Andersen, WorldCom's auditing firm, also
should have detected the irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you paying them for if they can't detect $3.9 billion in
errors?" Coffee said. "Either they are innocent and useless because
they can't catch huge errors, or else they participated by looking
the other way."</TE>
<TE>   The WorldCom debacle will make little difference to Andersen,
which already is in the process of dissolving after its conviction on
a criminal obstruction-of-justice charge.</TE>
<TE>   Although WorldCom's misstatement of expenses could have been
limited to just a handful of people, the Xerox case represents a more
widespread policy by the financial accounting staff, Coffee and
Turner said. That's because Xerox staff members would have had to
search sales activity each quarter for ways to recognize revenue
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   "They would have looked for contracts they could say are binding
even though they might be no more than a salesman's handshake with
lots of ways for the client to get out," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   That process allowed Xerox to book $6.4 billion before they were
firm contracts from 1997 through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox will now reverse $1.9 billion in sales and lease
transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these cases, as well as accounting and other financial
scandals at Adelphia Communications Corp., CMS Energy Corp., Dynegy
Inc., Enron Corp., Qwest Communications International Inc. and Tyco
International Inc., point to a breakdown in the checks and balances
system between an audit committee, the outside auditors, the internal
auditors and management, said Nell Minow, a shareholder advocate and
corporate governance expert.</TE>
<TE>   "The board of directors is at ground zero in the corporate
meltdown we are seeing now," Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox, for example, has faced questions about its accounting for
years but continues to have longtime, entrenched board members
sitting on its audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have problems with your accounting, the first thing you
should do as a board is ask what is wrong with the audit committee
and you bring in people who know what they are doing," Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   Inattentive board members also played a key role in the Enron
bankruptcy and the problems at Tyco, where recently deposed CEO L.
Dennis Kozlowski faces criminal charges that he evaded paying $1
million in taxes for artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Minow said the Tyco board approved a contract for Kozlowski that
exempted being charged with a felony as a firing offense.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did they approve that? Their first call should have been to
the law firm when they saw that," Minow said.</TE>
<TE>   Muller agrees that although boards won't always catch fraud, they
should be more skeptical and analytical about what's going on at
their companies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, William T. McCormick Jr. resigned as chief executive
of CMS Energy last month after the disclosure of $5.2 billion in sham
energy trades.</TE>
<TE>   These transactions, in which traders bought and sold electricity
without profit or loss, were designed to inflate revenue to give the
company an appearance of growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The board should have started asking questions when they saw
revenue shoot up but there was not corresponding growth in profits,"
Muller said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who is at fault, individual investors are concluding
Wall Street has little credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a happy camper with the stock market," said Alex
Centurioni, a 76-year-old Temple City investor who lost $20,000 in
the Tyco scandal. "People don't want to take chances investing now
because they are worried about all the big companies that faked their
numbers and what will come next."</TE>

<HD>Few Major Airlines Ask for U.S. Loans</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Just four of the nation's 11 biggest carriers
apply for aid. Stock requirement may have played a role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than half of the major U.S. airlines sought government-backed
loans by Friday under a program created to help the industry recover
from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Of the country's 11 largest passenger airlines, only four--America
West, American Trans Air, United Airlines and US Airways--asked the
Air Transportation Stabilization Board to lend them money to keep
flying.</LD>
<LD>   The loan program required airlines to provide detailed information
and let the government buy stock in their companies, a provision
modeled after the Chrysler bailout.</LD>
<TE>   "Once they actually looked at what the deal was, a lot of them
said, 'We'll pass,' " said Dean Headley, associate professor of
marketing at Wichita State University and co-author of an annual
study on airline quality. "That doesn't mean they're all out of the
woods, but the baggage that came with the loans is something they
didn't want to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Nine smaller airlines have applied for help under the $10-billion
loan program, according to the Air Transportation Stabilization
Board.</TE>
<TE>   Four submitted applications shortly before Friday's deadline:
Aloha, Frontier, Great Plains and World. The others are Evergreen
International, National and Spirit, whose applications still are
pending, and Frontier Flying Service and Vanguard, both of which were
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the board has approved one application, that of America
West, which received $380 million in government-backed loans in
exchange for warrants to buy 5.3% of the airline's stock.</TE>
<TE>   Those still waiting to hear about their applications include
United Airlines, which sought $1.8 billion in loan guarantees; US
Airways, which asked for $900 million in backing; and American Trans
Air, which requested $165 million.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Alaska, American Eagle, Delta, Continental,
Northwest and Southwest all said Friday that their airlines would not
ask for government help.</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays California's New Credit Card 'Warning' Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday temporarily blocked the implementation of a
California law that would require the nation's biggest bankers to
include credit card payment "warnings" in monthly customer
statements.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, handed down by U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell,
came three days before the law was set to go into effect.</LD>
<LD>   A group of financial corporations, including Chase Manhattan Bank
USA, CitiBank and MNBA America Bank, filed a lawsuit a month ago to
stop the law, which would require the companies to warn customers
about how long it takes to pay off credit card balances by making
only the minimum monthly payment.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling came as a shock to consumer groups, which said the
credit card companies never raised any concerns before, even though
they participated in designing the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed," said Hallye Jordan, spokeswoman for Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer, named as a co-defendant in the case with the
Department of Consumer Affairs. "A good consumer law is postponed as
a result of the bankers waiting to file an eleventh-hour lawsuit over
a law they helped negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen corporate lawyers appeared in court Friday to
argue that the law would interfere with interstate banking, which is
illegal under federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Howard N. Cayne, an attorney for the Washington-based firm
representing the banks, said that because adding the warnings would
be costly, banks would have no other choice but to increase their
minimum monthly payments. States are not allowed to pass laws that
interfere with monthly payment schedules or interest.</TE>
<TE>   Damrell ordered both sides to research the issue and told the
bankers to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove the warnings
would be burdensome. The parties will turn in their reports in
October and the case will be heard Nov. 8.</TE>

<HD>Disney Amends SEC Filings, Citing Math Error</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Firm's corrections of goodwill write-downs do
not change its bottom line.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. on Friday amended filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to correct a math error linked to new accounting
rules.</LD>
<LD>   Disney said the error does not change its bottom line or cash
flow.</LD>
<LD>   The entertainment giant said the amended filings were only to
correct a line item in its last two income statements in which
year-earlier earnings were stated to exclude the effect of a new
accounting rule, FAS 142. The rule requires companies to write down
their goodwill assets to reflect any permanent declines in value.</LD>
<TE>   The error occurred because Disney mistakenly included goodwill
charges from its Internet Group that should have been excluded. As a
result, its adjusted earnings last year were lower than they should
have been.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of showing a loss of $9 million before the effect of the
accounting rule in the six months ended March 31, 2001, Disney said
it should have reported a gain of $176 million during that period.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said the error was discovered
this week. "As soon as we knew there was an error, we moved quickly
to make sure that we corrected it," Staggs said. "I take
responsibility for these financials and will continue to do so....
I'm convinced that we're accurate in reporting all of our
financials."</TE>

<HD>Consumer Sentiment Drops in June</HD>
<DH>Economy: Spending falls in May for the first time in six
months. But analysts say the recovery is still on track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer sentiment suffered its biggest one-month drop since the
Sept. 11 attacks in June as reports of job losses, battered stock
markets and news of corporate shenanigans all weighed on Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Government data released Friday showed personal spending fell in
May for the first time in six months, but the latest evidence from
auto showrooms and retail stores suggests shopping is not going out
of fashion. That's crucial because consumer spending makes up
two-thirds of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   A separate report showed the pace of manufacturing activity in the
Chicago area slowed in June but still registered its fifth straight
month of solid growth.</LD>
<TE>   Taken together, analysts said, resilient consumers and an
improving manufacturing sector suggested that worries of a double-dip
recession were overdone.</TE>
<TE>   "The expansion remains on track," said Paul Kasriel, chief U.S.
economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's final June consumer sentiment index
fell to 92.4 from 96.9 in May, but that was up from a preliminary
reading of 90.8 released two weeks ago. Economists had expected the
index to be unchanged from its mid-month reading.</TE>
<TE>   June was a rough month for consumer confidence amid charges of
corporate insider trading and news that shocked the markets:
telecommunications company WorldCom Inc. said it had improperly
accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Warnings of potential terrorist attacks on the United States
during the Fourth of July holiday and a 7.4% slide in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index during the month have done little to boost spirits.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions index, which tracks consumers' views about their
present financial situation, fell to 99.5 in June from 103.5 in May
but was up from a preliminary 97.9.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the Michigan expectations index, which measures
attitudes on the 12-month outlook and fell to 87.9 from 92.7 a month
earlier, still stood at levels consistent with solid spending growth
in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department reported that personal spending fell 0.1%
in May, primarily because of weaker auto sales, while personal income
rose 0.3%, a sixth straight month of gains.</TE>
<TE>   Declining spending and rising incomes helped fortify people's
finances, boosting the saving rate to 3.1% of disposable income in
May from 2.8% in April.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the consumer pullback in May, analysts said anecdotal
evidence and weekly reports on chain store sales this month have
indicated that shop-happy Americans have not disappointed in June.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, even as May auto sales stumbled, Ford Motor Co. raised its
third-quarter North American production estimate by 16% from a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Americans also have taken advantage of low mortgage rates and
turned to homes as a new source of investment, supporting demand for
big-ticket items such as refrigerators. Reports this week showed
record demand for homes.</TE>

<HD>Raytheon, Lockheed Will Share 2 FAA Contracts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raytheon Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. will share two Federal
Aviation Administration contracts with a combined value of $2.7
billion to settle a complaint over the handling of one of the project
awards, company and government officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement gives Raytheon a piece of a $1-billion project
awarded to Lockheed Martin to improve computer software in 20 FAA
centers that direct planes at high altitudes.</LD>
<LD>   Lockheed gets to be a subcontractor in a $1.7-billion upgrade of
software and processors at 173 centers at or near airports that guide
planes within 50 miles of takeoff and landing. Spokesmen for both
companies declined to disclose the value of the participation in each
other's contracts.</LD>
<TE>   The Raytheon project, called the Standard Terminal Automation
Replacement System, or STARS, started in 1996. The start of the
Lockheed project, called the En Route Automation Modernization
Program, or ERAM, had been delayed while the companies and the FAA
worked to settle the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked Raytheon and Lockheed Martin to work this out, and they
came to us with a good proposal that now allows us to begin
modernizing," FAA spokesman Scott Brenner said. The FAA must finish
the upgrade by 2008 because the computers it uses no longer will be
compatible with other software the agency plans to use.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon, the third-largest U.S.
defense contractor by sales, rose 65 cents to $40.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin, the largest
defense contractor, fell $1.93 to $69.50, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA last year said it planned to give a no-bid award for ERAM
to Lockheed because the company had years of experience with the
system that reduced the risk of technical, cost and scheduling
problems. Raytheon protested, and the FAA in March said the companies
would compete for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon protested again that same month, saying the "playing
field" wasn't level with Lockheed. Raytheon declined then and now to
say why it believed the competition was unfair.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Fades; Central Banks, Fed Sell Yen for Japan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIDA POLETZ</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar waged a losing battle with market pessimism Friday, giving
up ground against the yen and euro even after the Bank of Japan sold
yen with the help of U.S. and European central banks.</LD>
<LD>   The dollar came within a hairbreadth of the psychologically
important parity level with the euro--touching 99.90 cents per euro
at one point in the European trading session--before a surprise round
of dollar-supportive central bank intervention offered the greenback
a reprieve.</LD>
<LD>   "Markets, which have focused on dollar weakness, were thrown out
of their stride a bit with the intervention to weaken the yen," said
Patrick Collins, currency trader at Ruesch International.</LD>
<TE>   Japan, reliant on its export sector to give legs to its economic
recovery, has intervened seven times in the last two months to stem
the yen's strength. In its latest foray into currency markets, the
BOJ enlisted the aid of the European Central Bank and the Federal
Reserve to sell yen for dollars and euros on its behalf during U.S.
trading hours.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's action marked the first time in the recent series of
interventions that the BOJ had acted via the ECB and the Fed,
although neither the United States nor Europe sold their own yen
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were mixed as to whether the participation by the Fed and
the ECB was meant to send a signal to the market that unease may be
growing in the top three economies over movements in the currency
market.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar shot up over one yen to trade as high as 120.36 yen,
before slipping back to finish at 119.66 in late U.S. trading. But
the dollar remained well above the nine-month low of 118.36 yen
reached earlier in the session.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of this year, the dollar was worth 132 yen.</TE>
<TE>   The intervention also gave the dollar an indirect lift against the
euro, which earlier had advanced to fresh 28-month peaks just below
$1. In late U.S. trading the euro bought 99.2 cents, up from 98.9
cents Thursday and up from 89 cents on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Currency analysts contend the intervention will have a short-lived
effect, given the negative sentiment surrounding the dollar and U.S.
assets.</TE>
<TE>   News that Xerox Corp. would restate five years of results to
reclassify more than $6 billion in revenue further battered
confidence in the ability of the United States to keep drawing in the
foreign capital necessary to finance its trade imbalance, traders
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental forces at play--namely a rebalance of portfolios
away from distrusted dollar-denominated assets--has only begun," said
David Mozina, director of global foreign exchange and fixed-income
research at Bank of America in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the move in the dollar is not cyclical but secular in
nature," he added. "Today's intervention may buy the greenback time,
but that is about all."</TE>

<HD>State Court Reinstates Huge Ford Verdict</HD>
<DH>Autos: Judges restore $295-million award involving deadly
Bronco rollover. The company calls the ruling 'extreme and
unconstitutional.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court Friday reinstated a huge jury award against
Ford Motor Co., ordering the company to pay $295 million to the
family of three people who were killed when the metal-and-fiberglass
roof of their 1978 Bronco sport utility vehicle buckled in a rollover
wreck.</LD>
<LD>   The damages award, believed to be the second-largest ever in an
auto safety case, was thrown out by the trial judge in 1999 based on
a finding of jury misconduct, including a juror telling fellow jurors
of a dream about Ford Broncos killing their children.</LD>
<LD>   But in its 37-page ruling Friday, the three-judge panel in Fresno
said there was no proof the jury had failed to decide the case on its
merits. And in scathing language, the appeals court compared Ford's
actions in putting an unsafe vehicle on the road to involuntary
manslaughter.</LD>
<TE>   A Ford lawyer, calling the ruling "extreme and unconstitutional,"
said the company would seek a rehearing and, if that fails, would
appeal to the state Supreme Court. "The Court of Appeal decision is
patently wrong and does a grave injustice to Ford," attorney Theodore
J. Boutrous said.</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by Juan, Evangelina and Maria Romo, siblings
who survived the 1993 crash on Interstate 5 near Turlock that killed
their parents, Ramon, 39, and Salustia, 40, and their brother Ramiro,
18.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Romo, then 19, was driving the Bronco when another vehicle
veered as he was passing it, causing him to swerve. The Bronco
flipped, and though wearing seat belts, his parents and brother died
when the roof smashed, according to evidence at trial.</TE>
<TE>   The '78 Bronco had a metal roof above the front seat but a
detachable fiberglass roof in back. According to evidence in the
case, Ford considered adding a roll bar and metal reinforcement to
the fiberglass section but did not do so in its rush to get the
vehicle to market.</TE>
<TE>   Ford later modified the roof but did not recall the earlier
models. Plaintiffs argued this was particularly careless because the
Bronco, like other sport utilities, is more prone to roll over
because of its top-heavy design.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1999, the jury in Stanislaus County Superior Court found
the vehicle was defective and Ford guiilty of despicable conduct. The
jury awarded more than $4.9 million in compensatory damages and $290
million in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict came less than a week after a Los Angeles jury awarded
a record $4.9 billion--later pared to $1.2 billion--to six people who
were seriously burned when their Chevrolet Malibu's fuel tank
exploded in a rear-end crash.</TE>
<TE>   But in September 1999, Superior Court Judge Roger M. Beauchesne
ordered a new trial on punitive damages in the Romo case, saying the
jury's deliberations had been "infested with passion and prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   In one incident cited by the judge, a juror discussed and
erroneously quoted former Ford President Lee Iacocca as saying Ford
would rather pay settlements than fix unsafe cars.</TE>
<TE>   Beauchesne also cited a juror for telling fellow jurors of a
"morbid nightmare ...in which her child and the other jurors'
children were killed by a repeatedly rolling-over Bronco while Ford
attorneys and witnesses, armed with guns, mockingly chanted, 'Where's
the proof? Where's the proof?' ''</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals court said that jurors were repeatedly admonished
by Beauchesne and the juror foreman to decide the case on the law,
and that there was no proof they had failed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also rejected Ford's claims that there had been
no evidence on which to base punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it obvious that putting on the market a motor vehicle
with a known propensity to roll over and, while given the vehicle the
appearance of sturdiness, consciously deciding not to provide
adequate crush protection to properly belted passengers ...
constitutes despicable conduct," the court said. "Such corporate
conduct can constitute involuntary manslaughter."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court also brushed aside arguments that the amount of
punitive damages was excessive, saying that Ford " is a huge company
with enormous monetary resources" and that $290 million "is ... nine
days of its profits at the time of trial."</TE>
<TE>   The Romos' attorney, Joseph W. Carcione Jr., said he was "very
gratified" by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Whether stronger roofs should be required on vehicles is the
subject of fierce debate between consumer groups and auto makers. The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering beefing
up its 30-year-old roof strength standard. Auto makers are resisting,
saying the standard is adequate.</TE>

<HD>FTC Says Adult Fare Still Marketed to Kids</HD>
<DH>Media: Study says advertisers continue to push violent
content despite a wake-up call in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly two years after federal regulators blasted entertainment
companies for marketing violent movies, music and video games to
kids, the Federal Trade Commission said Friday that media companies
continued to advertise adult-oriented fare in music and magazines and
on television programs popular with children.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission finds little change in the practices of all three
industries with regard to advertising violent R-rated movies, M-rated
games and explicit-content-labeled recordings in media popular with
teens," according to the 62-page report.</LD>
<LD>   The latest report represents somewhat of a standoff between the
FTC, which continues to prod the media to adopt tougher marketing
restrictions, and entertainment companies, which say they have gone
as far as they are willing to go in limiting violence.</LD>
<TE>   The original September 2000 report--requested by then-President
Clinton--sent shock waves through Hollywood and Washington by
revealing that movie studios had tested R-rated movies on
10-year-olds and advertised during Saturday morning cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the commission's disappointment, the watchdog agency
continues to oppose new laws or regulations. "Because of 1st
Amendment concerns, we continue to think the best way to go is
self-regulation," said Richard Kelly, the FTC attorney in charge of
the report.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's credited the movie and video game industries for
halting some of the more egregious practices and voluntarily agreeing
to curtail ads for R-rated films and mature-rated games on television
programs for which more than 35% of the viewers are under age 17.
They also have stopped ads in magazines reaching high percentages of
children.</TE>
<TE>   But the FTC says such thresholds do not go far enough because many
TV programs, such as "7th Heaven" and "Real World," have large teen
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   For the third time, the FTC singled out the music industry for
showing "virtually no change" in its ad practices and for refusing to
adopt any age-based marketing restrictions. The report did, however,
find that the industry was doing a better job at labeling its
"explicit content" stickers on CDs and was encouraged by the plans of
music conglomerate BMG to begin offering more specific labels, using
such content descriptors as "violent" or "sexual.".</TE>
<TE>   Hilary Rosen, head of the Recording Industry Assn. of America,
said the industry believed that parents were satisfied with the
labeling improvements adopted by most major music companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) said he was deeply
disappointed by the music industry's lack of progress. "I wonder how
high we need to turn up the amp before the music industry hears what
Congress, the FTC and concerned parents have been saying," Tauzin
said.</TE>

<HD>No Sticker Shock With These Luxury Cars</HD>
<DH>Autos: An influx of vehicles in the $300,000 to $900,000
range demonstrates confidence in the growing sector as well as in the
economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The stakes in the global car market are about to go way upscale.</LD>
<LD>   The battlefield is moving to a new level, the "ultra-luxury"
market that is estimated in a couple of years to reach more than $2.5
billion annually.</LD>
<LD>   For the well-heeled who want a luxury car that far surpasses the
best that Mercedes-Benz or BMW offers, there soon will be several
from which to choose, most in the rarefied $300,000 to $900,000
range.</LD>
<TE>   The new entries are from Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Bugatti--all now
German-owned--and DaimlerChrysler, which is reintroducing a marque
that's been off the market for 60 years: the Maybach.</TE>
<TE>   With the Maybach going on sale in Europe this fall and in the U.S.
next spring, and the first new Rolls-Royce developed under BMW
ownership due in January, sales of the ultra-luxury vehicles are
expected to hit 8,500 to 10,000 units worldwide, with a good number
of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic circumstances of the moment are probably less than
optimal for these types of vehicles but very suitable for the market
prospect over the next five to 10 years," said Susan Jacobs,
president of Jacobs Associates, an automotive consultancy that tracks
the luxury car market.</TE>
<TE>   "The baby boomers are aging beyond 50 years old, and people are
still sitting on a huge wealth cushion, even though it's smaller,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Maybach will come in two versions: the 57 (for 5.7 meters, or
133 inches), and the extended-wheelbase 62 (6.2 meters, or 151
inches), which will have rear seats that recline like first-class
airline seats.</TE>
<TE>   It features a standard built-in refrigerator, DVD screens behind
the front headrests and a choice of wood paneling: burled walnut,
cherry or amboyna, a variety from the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Also planned is polished granite, probably from Italy or Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The 62, designed to be a chauffeured limousine, has as an option
roof with "electro-transparent glass" in which an electric current
can turn the roof from transparent to opaque and stages in between,
depending on how much light the occupant wants.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer demand exists for the Maybach, which will start at just
less than $300,000, said Maybach brand manager Wayne Killen. "Half of
the world's billionaires live in the U.S.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 2.5 million people in this country with investable
assets of $1 million, or 35% of the world's share," Killen said. "We
also have 35% of the world's ultra-high-wealth people, who have
investable assets of more than $30 million. That's why the majority
of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys are sold in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen promises similar luxury in its upcoming Rolls-Royce at
a similarly stratospheric price, though the company is tight-lipped
about details because of an agreement that transfers ownership of the
brand name to BMW on Jan 1.</TE>
<TE>   Bentley's new $150,000 two-door, code-named the GT Coupe, is
coming to market next fall, and Bugatti is developing an even more
expensive chariot for next year, the Veyron, whose price estimate
ranges from $700,000 to $900,000.</TE>
<TE>   So many expensive vehicles coming to market is a testament to the
confidence auto manufacturers have in the growing luxury sector.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that the manufacturers read the market the same way:
that the population of people who can afford this type of vehicle is
growing," said John Crawford, a U.S. spokesman for Bentley.</TE>
<TE>   The GT Coupe has the powerful curves of Bentleys past and a mesh
grille like the Bentleys that raced in Le Mans 70 years ago. The
engine will push the GT Coupe from 0 to 60 mph in less than five
seconds and have a maximum speed that tops 180 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The Bentley vehicle and its engine will be built at the
Rolls-Bentley factory in Crewe, England.</TE>
<TE>   Few details are available about the upcoming Rolls-Royce, but BMW
executives promise it will be true to its British heritage, complete
with imposing grille, and not be a super-luxury BMW. The Rolls will
be built at a new factory in England.</TE>
<TE>   The Rolls is expected to have a "halo effect" on BMW's mainstay
brand, as the Maybach should for Mercedes and the Bentley and Bugatti
for VW and its Audi division. They are expected to generate showroom
traffic and media buzz that will rub off on the less costly brands.</TE>
<TE>   The Bugatti EB 16-4 Veyron, as it's formally known, will have
plenty of halo to spread.</TE>
<TE>   The sleek, race-car-like Veyron will have a 16-cylinder engine
with 1,001 horsepower and a top speed of 254 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But whether or not they make money is another question.</TE>
<TE>   "It will give them a point of differentiation, because the
mainstream luxury market is getting pretty crowded," Jacobs said.
"But as for making a profit, it depends how much of a boom economy
materializes as we go forward."</TE>

<HD>Scandals Help Push Market to Its Worst First Half Since
1970</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The second quarter ends with the Dow losing 26
points. Stocks overall show resilience despite news of Xerox
accounting woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first two quarters of 2002 were a season for scandal on Wall
Street as allegations of accounting fraud and corporate misdeeds
soured investors on stocks and helped drive the market to its worst
first-half finish since 1970.</LD>
<LD>   It was typical for the year that the second quarter ended Friday
with news of yet another accounting snafu--this time at Xerox, which
tumbled 13% after saying it inflated sales during the last five
years.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning with the Enron's descent into bankruptcy proceedings
late last year, investors have been bombarded by a series of
corporate meltdowns, many of them involving accounting problems. The
pace accelerated dramatically in recent weeks, with controversy
engulfing current or former executives of Tyco International, ImClone
Systems, Rite Aid and WorldCom in rapid succession.</LD>
<TE>   Combined with mixed signals on the U.S. economy, a plunging
dollar, continued unrest in the Middle East and warnings of more
terrorist attacks at home, the scandals helped push the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index to a 13.7% loss for the second quarter and a 13.8%
loss for the first half of the year--the worst since the benchmark
index lost 21% in the first half of 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, meanwhile, are once again outperforming stocks: A Lipper
Inc. index of long-term government bond mutual funds rose 3.7% in the
first half. If the trend plays out through the end of the year, it
would be the first time bonds have outperformed stocks three years in
a row since 1939-41.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the S&amp;P 500 and the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index dipped below the lows they hit in the big sell-off
that followed September's terrorist attacks. They remain dangerously
close to those levels, although some analysts took heart that the
market is showing some resilience despite the steady drumbeat of bad
news.</TE>
<TE>   "If the WorldCom torpedo couldn't sink the battleship, then Xerox
isn't going to do it," said Jon Brorson, director of equities for
Northern Trust Co. "People are impressed that the Sept. 21 lows held
in the face of disastrous news."</TE>
<TE>   The major indexes spent much of Friday in the black before giving
up gains late in the day as President Bush announced he would undergo
a colonoscopy today.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow ended the day down 26.66 points, or 0.3%, at 9,243.26. The
late slump left the Dow with a loss of 0.1% for the week--its sixth
straight weekly decline. For the year, the index is off 7.8%.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq rose 4.01 points, or 0.3%, to 1,463.21 on Friday, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped less than a point to 989.82. Both indexes managed
modest gains for the week, breaking five-week losing streaks.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York
Stock Exchange, while three advanced for every two that declined on
Nasdaq. Trading was very heavy as the NYSE had its fifth-busiest
trading day ever and its most active session since Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks were bolstered by a stronger-than-expected report on June
consumer confidence. Although a Commerce Department report showed
that U.S. consumer spending dropped 0.1% in May, reports earlier this
week showed that the economy grew more than forecast in the first
quarter. Leading economic indicators and home sales also gained more
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying economic story is OK," said Elizabeth Miller,
money manager at Trevor Stewart Burton &amp; Jacobsen Inc. "The market
should certainly follow. If you really look long term, the stock
market and the economy will move in step together."</TE>
<TE>   Others were less impressed, noting that investors remain wary of
committing to the market given accounting woes and an uncertain
outlook for earnings.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Friday, Treasury yields slipped and gold
plummeted $5.70 to $313.50 an ounce--capping its biggest weekly loss
in a year--as stabilizing stock prices drew money away from precious
metals.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors shares rose $1.95 to $53.45, recouping the $1.58
it lost Thursday amid rumors--denied by GM--of irregular accounting.
But Electronic Data Systems fell 15 cents to $37.15, adding to losses
from Thursday amid worries about its exposure to WorldCom, which is a
customer.</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks were mixed after the consumer news. Wal-Mart
Stores fell $2.69 to $55.01. But Claire's Stores rose $1.24 to
$22.90, having raised its second-quarter earnings forecast Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * Eli Lilly fell $3.43 to $56.40 after Lehman Bros. cut its rating
on the stock to "buy" from "strong buy." Other drug shares also
declined. Pfizer lost $1.75 to $35, Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped $2.15
to $52.26, Abbott Laboratories fell $1.50 to $37.65, and Wyeth shed
$1.48 to $51.20.</TE>
<TE>   * All 13 stocks in the Philadelphia paper products index rose.
International Paper climbed $1.26 to $43.58, Temple-Inland advanced
$1.27 to $57.86, and Weyerhaeuser gained 89 cents to $63.85.</TE>
<TE>   * Media stocks recouped losses caused by accounting concerns.
Viacom, owner of CBS and MTV, rose $2.79 to $44.46; AOL Time Warner
gained $1.08 to $14.71.</TE>
<TE>   * Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock index finished 3.5% higher. In
Europe, France's CAC-40 surged 4.2%, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 2.6%,
and Germany's DAX climbed 2.9%.</TE>

<HD>CEO Striving to Put Xerox Back in Full Working Order</HD>
<DH>Technology: Since Mulcahy took over the helm last year, she
has proved that she knows how to handle crises, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. Chief Executive Anne M. Mulcahy opened a speech before a
group of business executives in March by citing a Chinese curse: "May
you live in interesting times."</LD>
<LD>   Then the woman named by Fortune magazine as the sixth-most
powerful female executive in the country quipped: "I'd like to try
living for a while in less interesting times."</LD>
<LD>   That's unlikely, particularly given Friday's disclosure that the
world's biggest copier maker inflated revenue by $6.4 billion over
five years. But those who know the low-profile Mulcahy said she had
proved that she can handle crises, perhaps even better than the top
woman on Fortune's list.</LD>
<TE>   "When you compare her to [Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO] Carly Fiorina,
I give Anne higher marks," said Gartner Inc. analyst James Lundy, who
worked with Mulcahy when he was an executive at Xerox. "Carly took
over a company that was in pretty good shape. When Anne took over
Xerox, it was almost ready to go bankrupt. Today, they are on their
way back to being investment quality."</TE>
<TE>   Mulcahy, 49, was largely unknown to outsiders when named president
of Xerox in May 2000. She had been practically a lifer at the
company, having begun her career there a quarter of a century before
as a copier saleswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Things couldn't have looked worse at that point. The once- mighty
company was about to announce its first quarterly loss in 16 years.
Debt was piling up. Morale was plummeting. And the Securities and
Exchange Commission had launched the accounting review that led to
Friday's disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   There was little in Mulcahy's employment background--most recently
as vice president for human resources--to demonstrate she could deal
with the morass.</TE>
<TE>   "There was real, well-founded doubt that she couldn't get things
to the point where Xerox could be turned around," said Dan Schick,
stock analyst with financial research firm Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Mulcahy started by working the trenches. "She literally went out
to all the branch offices to bring up morale, having hundreds of
meetings," Lundy said. "She was completely hands on."</TE>
<TE>   So much so, that she steered away from schmoozing with
analysts--who were then courted like royalty--when there was work to
be done.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember once we were having a corporate analysts briefing,"
Lundy said. "She presented there and then excused herself to leave
because she had a meeting with one of the company's European clients
that was to take place in Rochester. Not everyone would have up and
left an analyst meeting for that. I was impressed."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the feel-good activities, Mulcahy oversaw the sale
of $2.3 billion of assets. She spun off several of Xerox's
established divisions, including one she had helped build up--the
inkjet printer unit.</TE>
<TE>   She inked new contracts, such as a four-year, $109-million
agreement with OfficeMax Inc. And she helped launch new products and
partnerships, including a joint venture with GE Capital to provide
financing for Xerox customers.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows how to interact but she can also be tough," Lundy said.</TE>
<TE>   Mulcahy oversaw changes in the executive ranks, including the
resignation of former Chief Financial Officer Barry Romeril. She
tapped veteran Xerox executive Lawrence A. Zimmerman as his
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, she ascended to the position of chief executive,
taking over from Paul Allaire, who stayed on as chairman. Allaire had
agreed to take the CEO spot on an interim basis at the same time
Mulcahy was named president.</TE>
<TE>   According to documents filed with the SEC, Mulcahy's base salary
last year was $1 million and she received an additional $2.5 million
in bonuses and stock. In January 2001, Xerox stock was trading at
$8.17 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed the year at
$10.42.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, shares fell $1.03 to $6.97.</TE>
<TE>   With all her accomplishments, Mulcahy will now face a new round of
tests. No matter how bad the accounting adjustments were in reality,
they were made worse by happening at a time when scandals at WorldCom
Inc. and other companies have shocked the country.</TE>
<TE>   If Mulcahy takes her own advice, she will approach the crises
methodically.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at Xerox for 25 years, most of my business career," she
told executives in March. "I feel like I've grown up in the company.
And so there's a tendency to think you know all the answers. Combine
that with a strong desire to make quick decisions in a time of crisis
and you have a recipe for potential failure."</TE>

<LD>Moscow may ban U.S. poultry imports beginning Aug. 1 if Washington
fails to update veterinary certificates to meet Russian safety
standards, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Russia banned imports of U.S. chicken and turkey from March 10 to
April 15, citing health concerns about antibiotics in feed and
salmonella. Despite a partial lifting of the ban, exports have been
slow to resume as Moscow has issued import licenses for a limited
amount of poultry meat while the two sides have tried to agree on a
new veterinary certificate for poultry imports.</LD>

<LD>The group that oversees the Internet's name system voted to exclude
ordinary Web surfers from its board in a move critics say allows
mainstream interests to tighten their grip on the online world.</LD>
<LD>   ICANN, or the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers,
abolished online election of individual Internet users to the group's
executive board. Instead, the 19-member board of directors will be
drawn from representatives of technical, business, government and
nonprofit organizations. It will have ultimate say over policy
matters that govern the domain name system for the Internet.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department said securities firms would face the same
rules on reporting suspicious activities that banks have faced for
years, beginning Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN,
released the final version of its suspicious-activity reporting rules
for securities firms, about six months after they were proposed.</LD>
<LD>   The rules will require securities firms to file so-called
suspicious-activity reports, or SARs, with FinCEN if a transaction of
$5,000 or more is suspected of involving illegal proceeds, is meant
to further "a criminal purpose," is structured to avoid such
reporting or appears to serve no apparent purpose.</LD>

<LD>The five largest U.S. airlines each had their corporate credit
ratings lowered one notch by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., partly because
of a disappointing revenue outlook.</LD>
<LD>   Ratings were lowered for AMR Corp., Delta Air Lines Inc., UAL
Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and Continental Airlines Inc. The
airlines have a greater credit risk because of concerns about airport
security, rising low-fare competition, business travelers' increased
use of discounted tickets and limited flexibility to reduce labor
costs, the credit-rating company said.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's recording units conspired with AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s music group to fix prices on tapes and compact discs of the
Three Tenors, a U.S. administrative law judge ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The judge upheld Federal Trade Commission claims that Vivendi
Universal's recording and music divisions illegally set a two-month
moratorium on discounts and advertising for earlier CDs, tapes and
videotapes of Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo to
promote the 1998 recording of the Three Tenors.</LD>
<LD>   James P. Timony, the FTC's administrative law judge, directed
Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Corp. and other Vivendi
Universal music units, including PolyGram Holding Inc. and Decca
Music Group Ltd., not to "fix, raise or stabilize prices or price
levels" of any audio and video product, the FTC said. The music
companies also were barred from placing limits on advertising of
video or audio products.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's U.S. shares rose 65 cents to $21.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Home Depot Inc. said it planned to seek business from the federal
government, changing a policy the company had in place since it was
founded in 1978.</LD>
<LD>   The Atlanta-based company said it had decided to seek the business
after feedback from its associates and customers and after further
evaluation of the requirements necessary to become a federal
contractor.</LD>
<LD>   Home Depot faced pressure from activist groups that alleged the
company didn't want to work with the government because it didn't
want to comply with affirmative-action laws. The retailer avoided
becoming a federal contractor or subcontractor because of paperwork,
a spokesman has said.</LD>
<TE>   Home Depot shares fell 47 cents to $36.73 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>American Honda Motor Co. said a shortage of carbon sheet steel due to
U.S. import curbs may force it to take the costly step of airlifting
steel from Japan to its U.S. and Canada factories.</LD>
<LD>   If Honda is unable to renegotiate some expiring contracts by next
week with U.S. and Canadian steelmakers, which supply American Honda
with 95% of its carbon sheet steel, it may have to import steel from
Japan, a spokesman said.</LD>

<HD>Verizon Wireless Reaches Settlement</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The cell phone carrier will provide as much as
$600 million in discounts to end hidden-fee allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless Inc. agreed Friday to provide as much as $600
million in discounts to settle a lawsuit with customers nationwide
who claimed the biggest U.S. mobile-phone carrier hid service
charges.</LD>
<LD>   Cell-phone customers sued Verizon and predecessors two years ago
in Superior Court in San Diego, claiming they didn't fully explain
special offers and hidden charges for rounding up calls to minute
increments, operator assistance, busy signals, service-switching,
contract cancellation and local and long-distance tolls.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, subject to approval by Judge William Pate at
a Sept. 25 hearing in San Diego, customers will receive coupons for a
$15 credit on a new 1-year contract or $30 on a 2-year contract; or
$15 off on items bought from Verizon; or a hands-free headset that
fits most mobile phones.</LD>
<TE>   The judge gave preliminary approval to the coupon agreement in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon denies the allegations in the lawsuit and plans to issue
"a new, uniform customer agreement" approved by the plaintiffs'
lawyers, according to the company's Web site and documents mailed to
customers this week.</TE>
<TE>   "The real value of the settlement is our new customer guide" to
explain the company's services and billing practices, said Verizon
Wireless spokeswoman Nancy Stark.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 million customers are eligible for the discounts. The
cost to Verizon Wireless depends on the number of people who use the
coupons, Stark said.</TE>
<TE>   Bedminster, N.J.-based Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of
Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, Verizon Wireless has agreed to pay
plaintiffs' lawyers as much as $7 million in legal fees and expenses,
which must be approved by the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Communications' shares rose 92 cents to $40.15 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Vodafone shares fell 20 cents to $13.65, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Report Says Bronfmans Will Try to Oust Messier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The top shareholder of Vivendi Universal is preparing to call for a
meeting of shareholders to oust Chairman Jean-Marie Messier after the
French media and utility giant's recent share-price slide, a
newspaper report said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Bronfman family, who own 5.05% of Vivendi stock,
are furious that Messier wasn't removed by the board of directors at
its meeting Tuesday, the French business newspaper La Tribune
reported. The article cited people familiar with the matter but did
not identify them.</LD>
<LD>   The report said the French members of the board rallied to defend
Messier, while five North American members--including Edgar Bronfman
Sr., Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Samuel Minzberg, who represents Charles
Bronfman on the board--voted against the chairman.</LD>
<TE>   A Vivendi spokesman declined to comment to the Associated Press
about the report.</TE>
<TE>   Rules established between Canada's Seagram, French pay-TV company
Canal Plus and France's Vivendi--which merged in 2000--make it
difficult for individuals or groups to call for a special
shareholders' meeting, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Friday, Vivendi announced it is selling about 5.27
million shares in French construction company Vinci, valued at $347
million based on Thursday's closing price. The move is part of
Vivendi's debt reduction strategy, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, France's commercial court rejected a request by a
shareholder rights group to begin an investigation of corporate
governance practices at Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   The group, the Assn. for the Defense of Minority Shareholders, had
asked the court to name an outside expert to look into the way
management kept the board of directors apprised of its decisions.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Vivendi's shares plunged 23%, to their lowest level in
13 years, after it unveiled plans to sell one-third of its stake in
utility company Vivendi Environnement.</TE>
<TE>   The board met Tuesday after Bernard Arnault, head of luxury goods
company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and a top Messier ally, quit
Vivendi's board.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Unit Receives $4-Billion Bid</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Even at that price, a sale to rival IDT would
represent a significant loss. A judge appoints a monitor to preserve
records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The vultures began circling WorldCom Inc. on Friday as a rival
long-distance carrier offered up to $4 billion for one of the
scandal-plagued telecom firm's biggest units.</LD>
<LD>   IDT Corp. of Newark, N.J., wants WorldCom's MFS Communications
unit, which provides local phone service to businesses. IDT's
chairman and chief executive, Howard Jonas, said he had approached
WorldCom's lenders about a possible deal.</LD>
<LD>   A WorldCom spokesman declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Even at $4 billion, a sale would represent a significant loss for
MCI parent WorldCom, which paid $15.5 billion for MFS in 1996. The
unsolicited bid by IDT, which has bought units from other distressed
telecommunications companies, could be the first of many from rivals
seeking to capitalize on the woes at WorldCom, which is the nation's
No. 2 long-distance firm.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom needs to entertain any serious offers for its business
than it can carve out," said Rick Franklin, an analyst at Banc of
America Capital Management, which owned about 424,975 WorldCom shares
as of March 31.</TE>
<TE>   IDT closed up 62 cents on Friday to $16.92 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Trading in WorldCom stock has been suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, a federal judge in New York said he would appoint
a monitor to ensure that WorldCom doesn't destroy financial records
or drain its limited financial resources by making exorbitant
payments to executives. The company acted to conserve its cash by
commencing a round of 17,000 layoffs and seeking more lenient terms
for some of its $30-billion debt load.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore described these and
other cost-cutting moves in a letter sent Friday to President Bush.
He said he was "surprised and outraged" to find that $3.9 billion of
routine business expenses had been classified as long-term capital
expenses, an error that hid WorldCom's losses over the last five
quarters and prompted a fraud lawsuit from the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Arthur Andersen was the company's auditor at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom disclosed the accounting irregularities Tuesday after
they were discovered in an internal audit. Coming on the heels of
huge accounting scandals at Enron Corp., Tyco International Ltd. and
other firms, the WorldCom admission sent investors fleeing from the
stock market as they wondered whether any of the books in corporate
America could be trusted.</TE>
<TE>   A WorldCom attorney pledged the company's cooperation with the
regulators and law enforcement agencies investigating the scandal. In
addition to the SEC investigation, two congressional committees have
sent subpoenas to executives, and the U.S. attorney in New York has
begun presenting the case to a grand jury, according to media
reports.</TE>
<TE>   "The company brought this voluntarily to the SEC itself within
days of learning of the shocking events," the attorney, Paul Curnin,
told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff during a hearing Friday. "We're
happy to cooperate with the SEC, the U.S. attorney and Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff's prohibition against destroying company documents was seen
as routine. But his decision to appoint a corporate monitor to
oversee payments to executives and other employees was unusual,
though not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important here to protect investors, the security markets
and WorldCom employees," said Peter Bresnan, deputy chief of the SEC,
which asked for the monitor. The SEC and WorldCom will propose three
candidates for the position, and Rakoff will select one at a hearing
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Next week also could bring a meeting between Sidgmore and IDT's
Jonas, whose firm has already bought pieces of Winstar Communications
Inc., ICG Communications Inc. and Teligent Inc.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has begun an aggressive campaign to cut its annual
expenses by $900 million. The first of 17,000 pink slips were handed
out Friday, including 100 at the company's headquarters in Clinton,
Miss. The biggest cuts were made in Virginia, Texas, Maryland and
Colorado. The layoffs will trim WorldCom's work force by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're frustrated and very angry," said Kimberly Spencer, a
31-year-old mother of two who was fired from WorldCom's accounting
department. "We worked hard for this company and we get this?"</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom also worked Friday to renegotiate its bank loans so that
it would have more time to repay its debts. The company's lenders
could demand immediate repayment of those loans in light of the
improper accounting.</TE>

<DH>Accounting: Top executives will be required to personally
attest to accuracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a list Friday of the
top 945 U.S. publicly traded companies whose financial statements
must be certified as accurate by their chief executive and financial
officers.</LD>
<LD>   The expected move comes after the disclosure this week by WorldCom
Inc. (ticker symbol: WCOME) that an internal audit at the
long-distance carrier found improper accounting of $3.9 billion in
expenses.</LD>
<LD>   CEOs and CFOs who make false certifications will face personal
liability, the SEC said as the agency makes a push to restore
investor confidence in the wake of recent accounting scandals to hit
corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   "We are demanding that CEOs and CFOs swear that the numbers
they've reported in their financial reports are correct and that
they've left nothing important out," SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said chief executives and financial officers would have to
personally certify the accuracy of financial books starting in
mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   The list, on the SEC's Web site at
www.sec.gov/rules/other/4-460list.htm, includes companies with annual
revenue of more than $1.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are AOL Time Warner Inc. (AOL), Citigroup Inc. (C), Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW), Eli Lilly Co. (LLY), General Electric Co. (GE),
General Motors Corp. (GM), Hilton Hotels Corp. (HTL), Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT), McDonald's Corp. (MCD), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Oracle
Corp. (ORCL), Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and United Parcel Service Inc.
(UPS).</TE>
<TE>   The SEC order requires a sworn written statement in which the
officers must personally attest that the most recent financial
statements are "materially truthful and complete."</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, they must explain why such a statement would be
incorrect.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC order applies to annual and quarterly reports such as 10K
and 10Q earnings statements; Form 8K disclosure statements and
definitive proxy materials and any amendments filed with the SEC
after the filing of the most recent 10K statement.</TE>

<LD>Investor enthusiasm for stock mutual funds dwindled last month,
according to new data released Friday, as confidence in the sagging
U.S. stock market has declined.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. stock funds pulled in a net $4.83 billion from investors in
May, down from an inflow of $12.93 billion in April, said the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based mutual fund industry
trade group.</LD>
<LD>   A crumbling stock market in June is likely to curtail an
eight-month string of positive monthly sales into stock funds.</LD>
<TE>   One data company, Santa Rosa, Calif.-based TrimTabs.com, projects
that investors will remove about $19.7 billion from stock funds for
the month of June, based on preliminary data through June 25.</TE>
<TE>   Bond funds took in a net $10.6 billion in May, up from $7.76
