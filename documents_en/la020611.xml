<HD>Screenwriters Give Fashion the Treatment</HD>

<LD>Hundreds of aspiring screenwriters lingered outside the hotel
ballroom, hungrily devouring free sushi and cocktails and mixing with
a large wedding party that swished around in formals. Signs posted
nearby targeted the fame-hungry: "Five free meetings with development
execs!" and "Want an Oscar? Get a Coach!" It was the final stretch of
the three-day Writers Guild Foundation's "Words Into Pictures" forum,
an event at the Hilton in Universal City that features nonstop
workshops and panel discussions.</LD>
<LD>   Needless to say, fashion was not a priority for this crowd. "It's
Day 3 of some really long sessions," said a screenwriter from Ottawa,
Canada. Scanning the casually dressed crowd, some in oversized
Hawaiian shirts, others in baggy pants and baseball caps, she
compared the "understated and elegant" locals with the
out-of-towners. "The out-of-towners, if you'll excuse me for saying
it, look like hell," she said.</LD>
<LD>   The commentary was apropos: The ballroom would be the setting for
a tongue-in-cheek fashion show, with screenwriters wearing duds that
reflected the themes from their famous films or TV shows.</LD>
<TE>   Emcee Fred Willard took the stage first to show off a shiny purple
suit that he said he bought in Cleveland. Next, "Seinfeld" writer
Peter Mehlman strutted down the catwalk in athletic wear: shorts, a
gray T-shirt and a baseball cap that he tossed into the audience.
"The China Syndrome" co-writer T.S. Cook dressed in fishing gear and
posed as Ernest Hemingway. The real crowd pleaser, however, was "Meet
the Parents" co-writer Jim Herzfeld, who bravely took the stage in a
pink bathrobe, bared his chest in a Speedo bathing suit and then
spiked a volleyball to the back of the room. It was an unusual way to
spend a Saturday night, one that might not soon be repeated. As
novelist and screenwriter Peter Lefcourt said, "This was the first,
and quite possibly the last, writers' fashion show."</TE>
<TE>   Renovated House Has the Wright Stuff</TE>
<TE>   Wandering guests exclaimed over the architecture of their host's
home, an open-air classic designed in 1926 by Frank Lloyd Wright's
son, Lloyd Wright. Nearly all of its rooms open onto a colorfully
lighted pool. At the head of the rectangular lot, which is nearly
invisible from Franklin Avenue, the master bedroom was accented by
two giant flaming torches that illuminated walls with Aztec and Mayan
accents. Inside the master bath, a koi pond featured lily pads and
grasses. The whole place is decorated in natural tones, and the
landscaping is delicate and subtle. "It's a garden of Eden," said one
guest. "Only it's in the city."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday night, the house was crowded with industry folks,
performers, psychics and an Austin Powers impersonator, all
celebrating the recent renovations of the property, known as Sowden
House. The party's hosts were writer Cliff Rothman and real estate
entrepreneur Xorin Balbes. The latter bought the Los Feliz home last
year for $1.2 million. "When I bought it, it was completely
destroyed," he said. "When you would touch the walls it would turn to
sand in your hands." After an exhaustive five-month renovation, he
was offered more than $4 million for the place. But he's not selling.</TE>
<TE>   From the master bedroom, which became a stage, singer Morganne
serenaded the crowd. During breaks, she modeled a bright blue feather
hat and sleek silver gown, then a hat of yellow flowers with a beaded
gown to match. As she sang, the crowd mingled. "Face lifts are over,"
said one guest, a plastic surgeon, to a new acquaintance. "They are
done." Every few minutes, Austin Powers, a.k.a. Richard Halpern,
dressed in a blue velvet suit with Edwardian lace collar, offered his
most authentic "Yeah, baby!" Most guests couldn't contain their
admiration of the house. "All you see are tall cypress, palms and
pines," said one man gazing at the sky. "I'm never leaving here,"
said another.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I've got metal on the bottom and clear on the top.... I'd broken
teeth in fights, tennis, wrestling, and as a result, my front teeth
were pushing hard on my lower teeth. The dentists told me I had to
change my bite. My kids think it's hilarious." --Tom Cruise in the
July issue of W magazine on why he's wearing braces.</TE>

<DH>Belly dancers of all ages, shapes and sizes converge at
this year's Cairo Carnivale in celebration of femininity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bellies were bulging and wrinkled, fat and firm. Rippled,
dimpled, pierced, protruding, sloped, rolled and toned. But however
they looked, all were shimmying.</LD>
<LD>   Mesmera, a belly dancer from Silver Lake in a beaded, red body
suit and veil, brought the house down with her wriggles and jiggles.
Kristen Cunningham, a raven-haired 37-year-old with twin tongue studs
and a Celtic tattoo, entertained with hip snaps and hand ripples.
Patty Campbell, a 71-year-old who was wearing a midriff-baring top
and maroon harem pants, practiced graceful Sufi turns and chest
circles. And Danielle Wilson, a 16-year-old with hip-length blue and
purple braids, synchronized snake arms with her aunt.</LD>
<LD>   More than 3,200 people--most of them women--attended last
weekend's 15th Annual Cairo Carnivale at the Glendale Civic
Auditorium, a two-day extravaganza hosted by the Middle Eastern
Culture and Dance Assn., or MECDA. They came to shake their stuff on
stage, watch other dancers and shop in a bazaar that offered
everything from hand-beaded bra- and belt sets to scimitars and
videos with titles such as "Hips!" and "Lock, Roll and Flutter."</LD>
<TE>   Belly dancing is not something they do to please men, the women
said, and indeed, few men attended. The dancers came to celebrate
their femininity--regardless of body shape, size or age.</TE>
<TE>   During the two-day Carnivale, 500 entertainers performed 130
separate shows on two different stages. In dance and dress, they
encompassed everything from "I Dream of Jeannie" Egyptian and Turkish
styles to the increasingly popular American tribal genre, with women
performing in groups wearing face paint, long velvet skirts and
chunky silver jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   Dancers ranged from abject amateurs who'd only recently mastered
basic moves to seasoned pros. Somewhere in between were Cunningham
and the members of her 12-woman troupe Jewels of the Dance. Wearing
black harem pants and sequined halters, they rocked the casbah with a
routine that blended traditional Mideastern moves with rock and
disco.</TE>
<TE>   "Belly dancing is so sensual and empowering and beautiful and
exotic," said Cunningham, who has 10 piercings in each ear to go with
her tongue studs. An accountant by day, she teaches a beginning belly
dance class at Glendale Community College. "I love the way it
embraces all women, all body shapes, all ages."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell started belly dancing in her 40s. Twenty-eight years
later, she is still shimmying--alongside women who work as lawyers,
doctors, even a roller-hockey player--as part of a troupe called
Moondancers. One of about 30 women who attended Saturday morning's
belly dance workshop, she did hip-rolling figure-eights next to women
who were half, even a quarter, of her age.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much acceptance in the belly dance movement of women's
bodies," said Campbell, of Fallbrook. "What attracts women to belly
dancing is the affirmation of yourself as a woman. When I first
started, it was done for men as a sort of sexual display. That's not
true anymore. Right now, belly dancing is a woman's movement. Women
are dancing to celebrate their own bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Sendek, 25, has been studying belly dance for the last five
years. Like many women who've taken to this centuries-old art form,
her love of belly dance was instant and enduring. She took one class
and "kept going and going and going," said Sendek, who lives in L.A.
and works as a receptionist. "After that, I would be walking around
at work doing little twitches. It just got in me."</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the Turko-Egyptian dance form is, according to many in
the community, reaching a peak never before seen in the U.S. Whereas
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism has created a backlash against
belly dance in the Middle East, the opposite is true in America,
where it has become something of a craze in recent years, inspired by
a variety of political and pop cultural influences, from the
swivel-hipped Colombian pop star Shakira to Disney's "Aladdin." As a
counterpoint to strife in the Middle East, a dance for peace held
Saturday night featured two dance troupes, one Arabic, one Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   Membership in MECDA, the 25-year-old group that hosts Cairo
Carnivale, has increased 20% since Sept. 11. Based in Rosemead, the
networking organization for those interested in Middle Eastern dance
now has about 850 members throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "It was as if people wanted to show their solidarity," said Marta
Schill, 58, the group's founder. "They love their country, but they
wanted to show they were not going to let politics interfere with
art."</TE>
<TE>   Or shopping. In their best re-creation of a Mideastern street
market, about 75 vendors set up shop in a "gypsy camp" and bazaar
during the Carnivale. Some tables were stacked high with chiffon
harem pants, silk veils and ankle bracelets. Others offered CDs and
instructional books titled "Costuming From the Hip" and "From Turban
to Toe Ring." There were finger cymbals and Egyptian figurines, henna
powder, carpetbags and camel marionettes.</TE>
<TE>   And there was food. Pasha, a Middle Eastern restaurant and
nightclub in Los Angeles, served plates brimming with hummus,
moutabel and pita to anyone interested in keeping with the theme of
the weekend. For those with less adventurous palates, they also
offered cheeseburgers and chips with a Coke or Frappuccino.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon, a handful of dancers participated in the
"shimmython"--an endurance contest for those with quivery hips and a
spirit of altruism. For 20 minutes, they followed the orders of a
"sultana," who directed them to add a body wave or shoulder shimmy to
their shake. Participants collected sponsors before the event. The
money was slated to be donated to the Casa Youth Shelter in Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   The exact origin of belly dancing is unknown, but it is generally
believed to have come from the Near and Middle East thousands of
years ago. It first came to the U.S. via the Chicago World's Fair in
1893, when a Syrian dancer called Little Egypt wowed audiences by
shimmying her hips and isolating her upper and lower body movements.
It wasn't long before Little Egypt was being imitated in American
carnivals and films, usually jokingly as a sort of hoochie-coochie
act.</TE>
<TE>   The term "belly dancing" is a misnomer, according to Alexandra
King, a professor of Mideastern dance at UC Santa Barbara, who taught
Saturday morning's workshop. "It has nothing to do with the movement
of the belly. It's all about the exposed belly. That's where the name
comes from.... Belly dancers, most of us hate [the term] because it's
not the real name of the dance, but we're stuck with it."</TE>
<TE>   True aficionados refer to it as raks al-sharki (Arabic for "dance
of the East") or la danse du ventre (French for "the dance of the
stomach").</TE>
<TE>   So, if the belly has nothing to do with it, then what makes a good
belly dancer? "Grace, strength, speed and flexibility, timing,
emotional content," said King, 50. "A woman who can really be
comfortable with her sexuality and her sensuality. That's really
important because it's a feminine dance. It's not about sex. It's
about being a female and being comfortable with your body."</TE>

<LD>THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</LD>
<LD>   Stories</LD>
<LD>   By Alan Bennett</LD>
<TE>   Picador USA</TE>
<TE>   200 pages, $15</TE>
<TE>   Chronic illness, foot ailments, strokes, AIDS, deathbed vigils,
the body betraying the soul, loved ones betraying each other: Such is
not the stuff of which comedy traditionally is wrought. But in the
hands of Alan Bennett, the British playwright and screenwriter ("The
Madness of King George"), the tragic and painful are close bedfellows
with the funny and the sexual, making for a collection of stories,
"The Laying On of Hands," in which we laugh at the situations
presented and then feel a twinge of guilt for having indulged humor
at such moments.</TE>
<TE>   The three tales--longish short stories that can be read in their
entirety over an afternoon--demonstrate Bennett's sharp ability to
use dialogue, coupled with an uncanny sense for flawed human
reactions to tragedy. Bennett's characters do not do the noble and
high-minded thing when under emotional strain. Rather, like most of
us, they think they'll be heroic when misfortune strikes but find
themselves acting in undignified ways at the crucial moment.</TE>
<TE>   The title story is a biting satire of a memorial service told from
the point of view of two ministers: Canon Treacher, who's attending
to critique the service, and Father Jolliffe, the presiding minister,
about whom Treacher is going to make his report. The deceased is
Clive Dunlop, a masseur who died in Peru under hazy circumstances at
the age of 34.</TE>
<TE>   The church is filled with celebrities, politicians, members of the
Royal Shakespeare Company and pop singers--every cross-section of
power and prestige is represented. Most of the mourners know each
other and they all knew Clive, but none had known that the others
knew Clive as well.</TE>
<TE>   Clive's magical healing hands had eased the suffering of many in
the congregation. "Though Clive was scrupulous never to omit the
ceremony of massage, for some it was just the preliminary to a more
protracted and intimate encounter .... Father Jolliffe wondered who
were here just as grateful patients ... and who had come along to
commemorate the easing of a different sort of burden." The entire
congregation, the minister included, wonders if perhaps Clive died of
AIDS and may have left them with that ominous calling card.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the story shifts from grief to relief and back again
as the eulogies run amok and the doomsayers are put in their place
with the supposed "real" story of Clive's demise. Throughout this and
the other tales, Bennett plays with the emotional ambiguity at the
heart of the story (are the mourners more beleaguered by Clive's
passing or by what it means to their own lifespan?) using mordant
humor to neutralize the weightiness of the subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the story ends on a note suggestive of the
sexual-abuse scandal within the Catholic Church. Although written
well before the revelations in today's headlines, the story's
correlation overshadows the rest of the tale.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Fozzard Finds Her Feet," limns the life of an old-maid
department-store clerk who cares for her stroke-addled brother and
strikes up what might be a romance with her chiropodist (or, as the
Americans say, her podiatrist), a narrative in which the author leans
heavily on the intrigue of a foot fetish.</TE>
<TE>   The final and perhaps strongest offering, "Father! Father! Burning
Bright," is based on Bennett's BBC film "Intensive Care." The tale
focuses on Midgley, a middle-aged teacher who keeps vigil as his
father dies. Undercutting the sadness are years of unfinished battles
between the two and Midgley's desire to be there at the moment of
death, in essence, as the victor. The humor throughout is caustic.
Midgley asks his Aunty Kitty, for example, what his father had been
like. "He was a saint," she replies. "You take after your mother
more."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of one-line zinger seems Bennett's strongest weapon as
he disarms doleful situations. In taking pains to make sure we keep
laughing, though, Bennett fails to get beyond this sitcom
presentation to the real complexities beneath. The sexual
circumstances that end each of the stories are likewise troublesome
in that they shift our focus from the perplexing dilemmas to
simplistic resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   When, in "Father! Father! Burning Bright," Midgley takes off for a
romp with a robust nurse, we can't help but wish the British penchant
for funny sexual predicaments could have been subverted somehow.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of Bennett's stories is that they open our awareness
to troubling dilemmas. Before we can fully explore the intricacies,
though, he makes a joke and moves on. This technique may work well in
a visual medium, but on the page, where readers expect to dig in past
the surface details, it seems a bit flimsy, and the jokes about these
heavy subjects often fall flat.</TE>

<HD>A Closer Look at Intelligence Reveals Little at the CIA and
FBI</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question everyone in Washington is asking about the terrorists
who crashed into the Pentagon is, "When did the CIA know about them,
and when did the FBI find out?"</LD>
<LD>   It appears the CIA was tracking Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf
Alhazmi, members of Al Qaeda, who were linked to terrorism involving
the bombing of the Navy destroyer Cole.</LD>
<LD>   Almihdhar came in and out of the U.S. on visas to meet with other
suspects. The CIA kept track of him through 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Originally the CIA denied it had information on Almihdhar after he
was listed as one of the suicide bombers. Rumor has it the CIA keeps
its information secret to save their necks.</TE>
<TE>   There are two sides to every story. First I went to the CIA and
talked to Mr. X.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you not tell the FBI before Sept. 11 that you were
tracking down Almihdhar?"</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since the traitor Robert Hanssen turned out to be a spy for
the Russians we haven't trusted the FBI," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But at least you could have dropped off an e-mail to tell them
you were on to something important."</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI's computers are so old they would never have gotten it.
Besides, Almihdhar was our terrorist and not theirs. They are always
taking credit for everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   "Almihdhar entered and left the country many times. If you had
told the FBI, they would have told the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to look out for him."</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to tip our hand. Besides, Almihdhar might lead us
to Bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   "Rumor has it that the head of CIA ordered his people to shred all
the papers so no one would find out about the fiasco."</TE>
<TE>   He said angrily, "Go take a flying lesson."</TE>
<TE>   I then went over to the FBI to hear its story.</TE>
<TE>   Agent 342 told me, "The first time the FBI found out about the
CIA's tracking is when we read it on Yahoo. It was squeezed in
between an advertisement for suntan oil and a trip to Jamaica. It
took us three weeks to break the code. When we found out it was from
the CIA, we went ballistic."</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you go over to the CIA headquarters and find out what
was going on?"</TE>
<TE>   "The CIA is in Virginia and we're in Washington, so we have no
jurisdiction over them."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you planning to have better relations with the CIA?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to them. After all, they have all the secrets. There is
talk that the White House wants the agencies to work together, but
it's not easy after they stuck it to us."</TE>
<TE>   "What is the difference between the CIA and the FBI?"</TE>
<TE>   "They have rogue agents and no one knows what they're doing. We
have whistle-blowers, so everyone knows what we're doing."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At the Manhattan nightclub Spa the other night, the Lady Bunny--New
York's preeminent drag queen DJ--flipped back her blond bouffant and
selected a disco track while a man in a red bowler hat and matching
zoot suit used his cigarette to slowly pop balloons that were tied,
bondage style, around limbs of his female partner.</LD>
<LD>   As the music quieted, a pudgy man with a lisp and heavy black
eyeliner took the microphone. "I just want to propose a toast to the
woman of the night, the reason why we're all here, and the reason why
we all went to bed satisfied after reading under our covers with a
flashlight, Miss Xaviera!" Every head turned to the heavy-set,
silver-bobbed, 60-year-old woman holding court in a white vinyl
booth. There she was, in the very flesh that the crowd knew in
literary detail: the Happy Hooker, Xaviera Hollander.</LD>
<TE>   Such moments are all in a night's work--and play--for Hollander.
Ever since her infamous 1972 tell-all of her career as a legendary
New York madam, she's often been the center of attention. Decades
since she was exiled from the country after exposing her business
(double-entendre intended), Hollander is back--legally--to bask in
the glory of the 30th anniversary reprint of "The Happy Hooker," as
well as her new memoir and 21st book, "Child No More" (both published
by Regan Books), an exploration of her parents' death and the role
they played in developing her famed sexuality. "It's utterly serious,
this book," she says, studying her aging hands. Then she looks up
with a seductive smirk. "It's the book that makes me a mensch
again--not just a love machine."</TE>
<TE>   During the afternoon before her party, Hollander relaxes at a
hotel just five blocks from where she ran her brothel. In lavender
flip-flops and a flowing black peasant dress painted with an enormous
pink amaryllis, she orders a cup of tea and begins to ruminate on a
career that truly lives up to the cliche of illustriousness.
Hollander lightheartedly spews anecdote after unprintable anecdote,
peppering her stories generously with profanity and glorying in
physical details that would be shocking from the mouths of most
people. It's just her way.</TE>
<TE>   Her conversation is halted occasionally by appearances of her
entourage. Hollander's "slave of 28 years," a thin, unsmiling woman
with close-cropped brown hair, pops by with an envelope of press
photos, prompting a quiet aside in which Hollander explains, "See,
slaves need love, too," she says, speaking quite literally. "That's
the hardest thing about being a masochist, is their partners so
rarely understand that." Next comes a polite interruption from a
young man who runs the Web site for the "bed and brothel, I mean bed
and breakfast" Hollander runs in Amsterdam, where she lives with her
female lover of many years. "I'm not gay, and I'm not bisexual--I'm
try-sexual. I'll try anything," she announces frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Hollander reveals two moods, which she enters and exits as if
through a perpetually revolving door: her humorous sexual side
("humor is what got me famous, what made me famous and what kept me
famous," she says), and the mournfulness that drove her new book. In
some ways, "Child No More" may be just as taboo-breaking as her
previous writing, as she takes on themes of incest while exploring
her own sexual infatuation with her parents, graphically imagining
intercourse between her parents and offering a detailed account of
her mother's genitalia. But this book is more of an investigation of
death than sex.</TE>
<TE>   Xaviera DeVries (her real name) was born to a gentile German
mother and a Jewish Indonesian father and spent her infancy during
the Holocaust in a Japanese concentration camp in her father's
homeland. Her mother was captured and brutalized after attempting to
steal some sugar to feed a feeble baby Xaviera. Given up for dead,
she miraculously climbed from a pile of corpses to return to care for
her baby, a story Hollander held back tears to read aloud last week
during a sold-out engagement at Fez, another downtown New York club
with an occasionally lascivious reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "Child No More" is book-ended by scenes of her mother's actual
death, with her beloved father's passing providing its centerpiece.
Her history traverses oceans to bring her from Indonesia to the
Netherlands, where she grew up, to her New York years and back. "I
cried a river writing this book," she says. "It was my mourning
process. It substituted [for] sex for me. I couldn't have proper sex
when I was writing those tough scenes, like my father dying and the
scenes in the camp. But when the book was done--whew--I had five
different partners in two weeks!"</TE>
<TE>   Though Hollander's professional life has mellowed, she's hardly
leading your typical 60-year-old's existence. She's a regular at
Dutch fetish parties and at international conferences on sex. She
continues to write the Call Me Madam column for Penthouse that she
began 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   And she's still running illegal entertainment out of her home in
Amsterdam--though of a very different variety. It's a dinner
theater--a salon of cuisine and performance--often focused on Jewish
themes. But, because she has no license to do so, authorities often
show up to shut her down, just like the old days. "It's like a
speak-easy, or, you know, like what I used to do," she says. "Let's
just say I'm probably the quickest packer on earth."</TE>
<TE>   For all her attempts at defining herself as a patron of the arts
and a serious memoirist, it's still the "Happy Hooker" image that
follows her. "That was never my intention," she says. "I cut off all
my hair and moved to Canada after the press jumped all over my book.
But it's stuck as society has changed." Hollander speaks often of how
AIDS pushed the sexual revolution back to the '50s, largely because
of what she considers its sibling plague--"afrAIDS," people's fear of
AIDS--more than the syndrome itself.</TE>
<TE>   But she thinks that's changing, citing the public sexual power of
teen girls a la Britney as an overdue manifestation of girls' early
maturation.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear among her fans that many see Hollander as one of the
key figures to open the floodgates to a more sexualized culture--a
development to which a drag queen sex worker, an AIDS activist and
Village Voice columnist Michael Musto all testified onstage at Fez
after Hollander's reading.</TE>
<TE>   But does Hollander still wield influence?</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly," says Vern Bullough, who founded the Center for Sexual
Research at Cal State Northridge and has written more than 40 books
about sex. "She made sex guilt-free for many people. Her writing was
extremely influential, and it has relevance today. It shows us some
of the pathways along which society went to reach this point. We
needed somebody like this to break the barriers. And she's still
extremely important and daring--and remarkably, she still keeps ahead
of it all."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, clearly the boys at Customs still think I'm a threat," she
says with a laugh. To punctuate a discussion of her enduring
relevance (and reputation), Hollander reaches into her handbag to
reveal a magenta Dutch passport with a head shot-quality photo to
show the travel visa that triggers alarm at JFK airport (it's tough
not to imagine what it would fetch on EBay).</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, I'm here legally now," she says, "but I'll tell you what
it's like to get into the country as the Happy Hooker. They scan this
though a machine and make you wait in a room for an hour and a half
while they ask: 'Are you here to open a bordello? Are you here to
make any monkey-business?' At this weight? At this age? I'd have to
be the one to pay for it!"</TE>
<TE>   Xaviera Hollander will be signing and reading from her new book
tonight at 7:30 at Borders Books and Music, 330 La Cienega Blvd., Los
Angeles.</TE>

<LD>This chest of drawers (or commode in French) was made especially for
the youngest daughter of King Louis XV of France, Madame Louise. It
was made under the direction of Royal Cabinetmaker Gilles Joubert. It
took many craftspeople to produce a single piece of elaborate French
furniture like this one.</LD>
<LD>   During the 18th century, when this piece was made, decorative
furniture was built in several steps, and each step involved the
expertise of different people. A woodworker put together the body, or
framework, of this commode, using plain, sturdy oak. Then it was
passed on to the cabinetmaker. The cabinetmaker (in this case
Joubert) created a layer of beautiful patterns made up of many very
thin pieces of expensive and exotic woods called "veneers." Joubert
assembled the veneers together and glued them to the surface of the
body. Joubert also designed metal decorations made of bronze covered
with a thin layer of gold to make the commode look even more
impressive. The last stage of construction was carving the thick
marble top. This was done by a master stonecutter.</LD>
<TE>   Joubert delivered the finished chest of drawers to Madame Louise
in 1769. It was placed in her bedroom at the Palace of Versailles.
You can see this chest and watch cabinetmaker Patrick Edwards
demonstrate techniques used to make it 263 years ago at the Getty
Museum. Demonstrations will take place on Thursday, Sunday and June
20 from 1 to 3 p.m. in the South Art Information Room. The museum
also invites children ages 12 and younger to stop by the information
desk in the entrance hall and receive a free postcard showing a
"Cabinet on Stand," attributed to Andre-Charles Boulle.</TE>

or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sundays or after 4 p.m. on weekdays.</TE>

handled it by going into my room and reading a book until she came in
and said she was sorry. (Emma, 9)</LD>
<LD>   * I was teased by my second-grade teacher. She said Kevin was my
boyfriend. She teased me because she thought I was cute when I was
mad. (I am cute when I'm mad.) I handled it by asking her to stop.
(Annie, 9)</LD>
<TE>   * I was teased by Yihan, who called me Freeklin because my name
starts with an F. When I told on him, he said, "Sorry." (Franklin, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * A girl teased me in second grade. She said she thought I was in
the first grade. She called me "Shorty." I didn't like it. I felt
embarrassed. I handled it by ignoring her and walking away. (Deborah,
9)</TE>
<TE>   Linda Smythe's students at Butterfield Elementary in Lake Elsinore
had the following experiences.</TE>
<TE>   * My cousin called me "dork" and "stupid." I just walked away and
said, "Stop it." He stopped and never teased me again. (Chris, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * I got teased by a kid. He said, "What are you looking at?" Then
he pushed me and was making fun of my mother, so I pushed him back. I
should have just walked away, and he wouldn't have thought it was
much fun. (Jovanny, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * My brother called me "football head," and my sister called me
"big head," and my mom called me "coconut head." I asked them to
stop, and they did. (Michael, 9)</TE>

<DH>In her book, an advertising lion reflects on making it in a
man's world</DH>

<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The woman who persuaded America to flick its Bic and love New York is
marveling at how much Los Angeles has changed over the last decade.
"I expected Century City," Mary Wells Lawrence says as her pearl-gray
Manolos click briskly down the path to her suite at the Hotel
Bel-Air. "That was pretty much ordained. But Wilshire Boulevard, I
can't get over Wilshire Boulevard. It's a canyon of glass."</LD>
<LD>   Voila. A quick snapshot of a prettified Los Angeles courtesy of
one of America's premier image makers, the woman who envisioned and
touted the pink beaches of Peru--even if she had to send her creative
director there twice to find them because they were that evanescent,
glimmering pink only in the briefest shard of light.</LD>
<LD>   It's been more than a decade since Lawrence has had reason to come
here as the peripatetic chief executive of the advertising powerhouse
that bore her name, Wells Rich Greene. Before the firm was sold in
1990 to a French agency that eventually sank it, the agency was a
virtual factory of pop icons, or plop icons, as the case may be.</LD>
<TE>   Her agency urged America to seek relief in Alka-Seltzer's plop,
plop, fizz, fizz, and to Midasize its cars. It helped save American
Motors from bankruptcy with its campaign launching the Javelin and
lifted up the sagging Ford Motor Co. with bootstraps that asserted
"Quality Is Job One." Earlier in her career, when commercial air
travel of the mid-'60s hadn't progressed much beyond its military
roots in offering creature comforts, Lawrence and her team declared
"the end of the plain plane" at Braniff Airways, directing their
client to paint its aircraft bright colors and dress its stewardesses
in Pucci. (She later married Braniff's dashing CEO, Harding Lawrence,
who died in January.)</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Mary Wells Lawrence, now 73, helped transform the
advertising industry by updating the unadorned sales pitch with
production values borrowed from Hollywood. Dubbed "the gray flannel
gal" by the media, she made business history twice--as the first
woman to head an advertising agency and the first woman CEO of a
company on the New York Stock Exchange. Her relentless drive earned
her a place in the Advertising Hall of Fame as well as vacation homes
in the Caribbean island of Mustique and St. Jean Cap Ferrat in the
south of France where she partied with Princess Grace. Her drive also
engendered a less savory badge of distinction on Madison Avenue--the
nickname Queen of the Black Widow Spiders.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of Madison Avenue's old guard decided women were dangerous
to the advertising community," she writes in her new memoir, "A Big
Life (in Advertising)" (Knopf). The Wall Street Journal has called
the book "charming," and the New York Times said, "That era of
60-second spots and lunches at La Cote Basque is evocatively and
compellingly brought back to life" in Lawrence's reminiscences.</TE>
<TE>   In "A Big Life," the queen glowingly recounts her
more-than-three-decade reign, which she abdicated when the agency was
sold. The book is filled with the sort of superlatives you might
expect from someone whose job it was to turn stumbling blocks into
steppingstones--or at least the public's perceptions of them. In a
typical burst of enthusiasm for her own work, Lawrence likens her
leadership style to a veritable galaxy of A-list movie directors:</TE>
<TE>   "I was the director, sometimes the star," she writes. "The people
I hired were the cast of characters and I was Elia Kazan, Mike
Nichols, Francis Ford Coppola or Robert Altman--whatever it took to
make them as good as they could possibly be."</TE>
<TE>   In person, Lawrence is far more circumspect and introspective than
she appears in print. That's partly the result of her second battle
against cancer 15 years ago. The experience of beating breast cancer
forced her to shift her sights beyond her career, which had long laid
claim to her talent for focusing intensely. "Surviving cancer
intensifies your awareness of other people's problems and makes you
want to help everyone in the world who needs help," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in her life, she questions some decisions she made
when she treated doubt as a luxury. Lawrence says that now she
wouldn't do cigarette advertising, which her agency did for longtime
client Philip Morris. "I've made a lot of mistakes in my life," she
says. "I'd be more critical today about almost anything. That's age.
But at the time, people were concerned about drugs, not cigarettes."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence is petite and stylish, with huge blue eyes the color of
Delft china, high cheekbones and a patrician nose. As she speaks, her
eyes sweep the room like searchlights, occasionally resting on her
interviewer. As a high-profile woman in the '70s when feminism was
still finding its way, she was once castigated by Gloria Steinem as
an Uncle Tom for buying into the male power structure. But Lawrence
has no apologies for taking on men at their own game.</TE>
<TE>   In the '60s and '70s, feminism "never entered my head," she says.
"I was so focused on coming up with miracle solutions for clients in
those years that I didn't care. I never went to any of the old men's
clubs. I was never part of the industry that sat around and had
lunches. I wasn't interested.</TE>
<TE>   "Later on it seemed to me, looking at the feminist movement as a
whole, that the people who did it were certainly as important and
effective for the movement as the people who talked about it. So I
have great pride in the fact that I was one of the women who did it."</TE>
<TE>   And now that she's scaled that mountain and devoted most of her
adult life to breathing the rarefied air of CEOs, she questions the
values of corporate America--and not only because of their impact on
women.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what my job was like the last seven years," she says. "It
wasn't so terrific. It was terrific when I was building the company
and I was finding creative solutions for myself. When the company got
big and I was the one who was putting out the fires and handling the
finances and the people, when I got into the purely business end of
the business, I was working just as hard and having so much less fun.</TE>
<TE>   "The big, big companies that are headed up by men, we had always
presumed that that was the ideal, that what women were trying to do
was to have the opportunity to get those jobs. But it struck me that
perhaps women in very senior jobs were looking at those men and
weighing that kind of life against a life with children and other
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence the legend came from unlikely beginnings. She was born in
Ohio to a traveling salesman and his homemaker wife. Her mother was
disappointed in her humble, silent marriage and decided to equip her
only child for a better life by offering Mary to the Youngstown
Playhouse as a child actor. She went on to study Method acting as an
adult, and although she wasn't interested in a career in the theater,
Lawrence later applied what she learned to advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "It occurred to me when I saw television--and when I saw the
advertising on television--that what was missing was a very obvious
kind of thing, which is that you are more moved by things that you
feel than by just presentations," she says. "If I tell you something
is good, it's not as effective as if you actually experience it."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence later smashed her head against a glass ceiling at one
firm, whose founder rewarded her good work with an offer of $1
million over 10 years--an astronomical salary for 1966. He then
refused to promote her to run the agency because, he said, the world
wasn't ready for female presidents. "He was shocked at the blazing
fury that came over me, the war he saw in my eyes," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   So she elected herself the first female president in advertising
by opening her own agency. And as intensely focused as she was on
life at Wells Rich Greene--"I looked upon anyone who left the agency
before 8 or 9 p.m. as a traitor," she writes--her life ambitions
didn't end there. "Well, I was very hungry, very hungry," she says.
"I was hungry for more than power. I wanted everything."</TE>
<TE>   And she had it. After a short-lived first marriage, she joined
forces with Harding Lawrence to form a very high-profile couple--not
least because of their unusual long-distance marriage. Mary spent
weekdays in her New York office and traveling around the country
visiting clients. On weekends, she flew to Dallas, where Harding and
their two daughters, Pamela and Katy, lived with Mary's mother. She
says long-distance mothering did not damage her relationship with her
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "We had lovely help, and I was there on the weekend," she says.
"They were going to have a huge outdoor lawn, treehouses, dogs and
cats and ponies. They were going to have a dream child's world with
Harding in Dallas, and there was never any possibility that I was
going to stop working. And we took them everywhere. When they were
not in school, they were with us every second."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiating New York on Harding's arm was helpful at a time when
powerful women were viewed with suspicion. Lawrence had to operate by
different rules than her male counterparts. She never met with
clients over cocktails as men did. Instead, she and Harding
entertained them and their wives at their home in St. Jean Cap
Ferrat. "I was a very attractive blond," she says. "It was comforting
for them, their wives, the community, that everyone knew that I was
absolutely, totally married and totally sexless. I dressed as a nun.
I wanted my clients to treat me like a man."</TE>
<TE>   These days, a couple of ad agencies have asked Lawrence to buy
them out, and a couple more have asked her to sign on as a
consultant. But she's reluctant to be "on a leash" again, as she puts
it. Meanwhile, she's trying to stay open to her new life as a woman
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Harding "felt very strongly that we had known what we were going
to do, but that alone I was a very different person than we were
together and that I should open up to my own possibilities. Now this
is a new life, and I should be the same about that as I have about
everything else in my life. I should grab it, focus and have a ball."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm beginning to wonder if it has something to do with my kids. It
seems that whenever I enroll one of them in a neighborhood public
school, the bottom drops out of the Los Angeles Unified district.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve years ago, I sent my daughter off to kindergarten at the
public school three blocks away, bucking a trend in my San Fernando
Valley neighborhood. Anti-busing sentiment was still strong, and
years of bad press about campus violence and district blunders had
convinced many of my neighbors that any alternative was better than
public school. But our small neighborhood campus was familiar and
clean, the kids nice, the teachers competent and kind.</LD>
<LD>   Then the recession hit California. State revenues plunged, and Los
Angeles Unified was pushed into its worst financial crisis in
history, forced to cut $1 billion--a quarter of its total
budget--from its spending during three lean years. Employees took pay
cuts. Schools lost lottery funds. Money for everything from books to
toilet paper to music teachers to campus police were cut. Classes
grew crowded, libraries were closed, bathrooms turned filthy,
teachers' aides were let go. Parents were frustrated, teachers angry,
and students seemed lost in the uproar.</LD>
<TE>   And on the day classes resumed after winter break and I found the
rickety lunch tables still smeared with dried food from weeks before,
I decided to start looking at private schools.</TE>
<TE>   Our campus would eventually recover, but by then, hundreds of
families like mine would be gone.</TE>
<TE>   No district in California escapes the knife when state revenues
drop, because schools are so vulnerable to our state's boom-and-bust
economy. Ever since Proposition 13 slowed the growth of property
taxes, the fate of school district budgets has been lashed to our
annual revenues.</TE>
<TE>   In flush years, class size drops, raises are doled out and new
books land on classroom shelves. Then comes an era of slash-and-burn,
which takes schools years to recover from.</TE>
<TE>   Some districts have found ways to cushion the cuts. When the
24,000-student Irvine district announced its plan to raise class size
to cover next year's projected $5 million shortfall, parents donated
more than a half-million dollars to help the district over the hump.
When art, music and science programs were threatened two years ago,
local corporate and charitable groups kicked in more than $2 million
to save them.</TE>
<TE>   But the giant Los Angeles Unified district, with 736,000 students,
has no benefactor with pockets deep enough to cover its yawning
budget gap. Parents in some affluent areas have tried to blunt the
cuts with contributions, but the district often puts hurdles in their
way, in an effort to preserve equity--to make sure, in other words,
that rich and poor kids suffer equally.</TE>
<TE>   So those who are able often opt to escape, and the loss of funds
they would have generated compounds the cuts for those who stay.</TE>
<TE>   We returned to L.A. Unified last fall, when I enrolled my middle
daughter in our local middle school. Twenty kids in a class, rising
test scores, an expanding menu of after-school classes--it sounded
like the district was on a roll. But we didn't even get a year in
this time, before the district began its financial slide.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight the school board will put the finishing touches on the
package of cuts required to bring the district's $5.2-billion budget
down to the limit sagging state revenues impose. It is the worst
financial crisis since the budget nightmare 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Board members have pledged to try to keep the cuts as far from the
classroom as possible. That's the same rhetoric we heard before. But
the reductions add up to $440 million--a number so large it obscures,
rather than illuminates, the reality of what is being lost.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts don't just mean bigger classes, fewer nurses and
librarians. They translate to fewer field trips, dirtier bathrooms,
longer waits in the cafeteria line. Those air-conditioners we paid to
have installed? Good luck getting them serviced. Those lawns our bond
money put in? There will be no money to pay gardeners to keep them
green.</TE>
<TE>   And as always, the devil is in the details. For example, we'll
save $18 million this coming year by dropping "Mid-Year Renorming of
Secondary Schools." That's bureaucratese for ending the reshuffling
of students that occurs midyear in classes that are too large or
small.</TE>
<TE>   That might sound like a good way to save money. But if the cut had
been in place this year, my daughter might very well have failed
math. Her class grew to almost 45 students last fall, and teaching
took a back seat to trying to keep order. Thank goodness the district
had the flexibility to bring in another teacher and break up the
class. That option would be off the menu next fall.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty of land mines like that buried in this budget.
And its true cost won't ultimately be measured in dollars and cents,
but in disillusionment and defections. And lost chances for
struggling kids.</TE>

<HD>Hottest Sale? It's a Shoe-In</HD>
<DH>Folks rise very early for a designer footwear event
benefiting women's clinic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There aren't many things in life that motivate women to roll out of
bed at 3, 4 or 5 a.m., slide into their cars in the dark predawn
chill and drive someplace to stand in line for hours.</LD>
<LD>   Count shoes--the hottest designer shoes at impossibly cheap
prices--among such motivators, for shoes are what inspired hordes of
women to arrive Saturday morning at the seventh annual Shoe Frenzy at
the Veterans Memorial Building in Culver City. The event was a
benefit for the Women's Clinic &amp; Family Counseling Center in Los
Angeles. Shoes were donated by designers of some of the most pricey
and artistic fashions for the foot: Jimmy Choo, Taryn Rose, Bally and
Salvatore Ferragamo, among others.</LD>
<LD>   There were 3,000 pairs of shoes retailing for up to $395 a pair,
but here they cost a mere $5 to $50.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been here since 3:30 a.m. since they are designer shoes,"
said Erin Frigo, an actress who brought a friend with her and arrived
early enough to jockey for a top-of-the-line spot in hopes of being
among the first to enter when the doors opened at 9 a.m. "Maybe next
year I will get here by midnight."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of sacrificed sleep and shoe madness made for a
testy line, where the women who had the audacity to try to line jump
got their comeuppance when the crowd loudly berated them. The women
who tried to cut the line were stopped by three sales-goers who had
appointed themselves pseudo security guards, standing as sentries at
the entryway, looking authoritative if not official.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken it upon ourselves to do crowd control so people
don't cut in the line," said Theresa Uhrig, a 35-year-old from
Brentwood who works in sales. "There are some women up here we have
had to repeatedly kick out. They asked me if I worked here and I said
we were volunteers." Another self-appointed security guard, Michael
James, who in a profound show of love arrived with his wife shortly
after 5 a.m. to queue up for shoes, described the line this way: "The
Lewis-Tyson fight is happening tonight, but that is nothing compared
to this. This is a riot. There was tugging and brawling.... This is
the most fun I've had in awhile."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the scene was just as chaotic inside. "People were
grabbing Jimmy Choos to barter for other shoes," said Desiree Luccio,
30, an administrative assistant who left her Manhattan Beach home at
4:30 a.m. Luccio hit the mother lode: She had two pairs of Jimmy
Choos and two pairs of Ferragamo. "I just have to get a social life
to go with these shoes," she said, holding a sling-back pair of
champagne satin Jimmy Choo heels with a beaded fringe dangling from
the ankle strap. "These are a hit. I have nowhere to wear them
though. I'll tell my husband these are our sex shoes."</TE>
<TE>   There was even shoe envy as women left the fund-raiser, boxes in
hand. Some still standing in line begged to see what women leaving
had scored. "It was like I had met Sting or something," said Luccio,
who said women were congratulatory and envious. "It was as if I was
returning from a hunt."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was so lucky. There were women who were distressed
that, after all that effort and waiting, there was not a better
selection in their size. "It wasn't worth it except that the money is
going to a worthy cause," said Wandachristine, a single-monikered
actress from Studio City who arrived at 5:30 a.m. with a friend. She
and her friend each bought a pair of Aerosole sandals for $15, but
that did not satisfy their shoe-shopping urge. "I was not going to be
denied, so we got in the car and drove to [outlets in] Camarillo and
there was nothing there. I felt that the universe was saying, 'Just
save your money.' "</TE>
<TE>   Despite the disappointments and crowds, people seemed happy to
help the Women's Clinic, which offers low-cost and even free health
care and psychological counseling for the uninsured and working poor.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to describe women's love for shoes," said Else
Duff, development director for the Women's Clinic who reported Monday
that the fund-raiser brought in $50,000, a record. "Some women
describe shoe shopping as therapeutic or a way to bond with
girlfriends. To us, the event is not just about our love of shoes but
our love of women. Each pair sold will in turn provide a vital
service for a woman in need."</TE>

<LD>By the end of Riley's birthday dinner, his sister, Wendy, was crying
and his dad was really angry.</LD>
<LD>   "Dad, please don't give away my gift certificate to Wendy," Riley
pleaded.</LD>
<LD>   Riley's mother tried to make peace. "Maybe Riley can select
something the two of them can use, like an educational game or a book
of poetry."</LD>
<TE>   "My mom would never force me to get a book or make me share with
my dorky sister!" exclaimed Sam, Riley's best friend.</TE>
<TE>   "May I go to the store now so I can buy something with my gift
certificate?" asked Riley.</TE>
<TE>   "Say 'please and thank you,' " said Wendy.</TE>
<TE>   "Please!" said Riley. "And thank you for my other gifts!"</TE>
<TE>   "He's really trying, honey," said Riley's mother. "And you can
drop Sam off on the way to the store."</TE>
<TE>   "My Mom told me I have to stay overnight," said Sam.</TE>
<TE>   "What a shame," said Riley's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "But, honey," said Riley's father. "I was going to watch the
ballgame on television."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got plenty of time before the game," said Riley. "Please

<DH>The versatile Samuel Ramey sings the lead in a comedy and a
tragedy as Los Angeles Opera closes its season</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As unlikely double bills go, it's like pairing "Lucrezia Borgia" and
"H.M.S. Pinafore." Or "The Seven Deadly Sins" and "Little Mary
Sunshine."</LD>
<LD>   Imagine, then, if the same performer were to star in each.</LD>
<LD>   What's playing at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion may not be quite
that extreme, but it's nearly as challenging. And Samuel Ramey is the
hero taking victory laps.</LD>
<TE>   Ramey is starring in the final entry of the Los Angeles Opera
season, an unusual duo of 1918 one-act operas: Bela Bartok's "Duke
Bluebeard's Castle" and Giacomo Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi," both
staged by film director William Friedkin. The production has two more
performances, Wednesday and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, some people just love a dare. "For years I've thought
it would be an interesting double bill," says Ramey, seated in Los
Angeles Opera artistic director Placido Domingo's office at the Music
Center on a recent afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The two operas are so miles apart, how much more opposite could
they be? And the two roles? I just thought it would be a challenge
for me to do both in the same evening. It's quite a turnaround."</TE>
<TE>   As if the pairing weren't daunting enough, there's more. "Gianni
Schicchi," the Puccini comedy about relatives scrambling for a dead
man's money and the charlatan who outwits them for the sake of a pair
of young lovers, is a role debut for Ramey. And although he has sung
the macabre tale of Bluebeard and his ill-fated wives before in
English, he's performed it in Hungarian only in concert, so singing
it in Hungarian, fully staged as he does here, is a kind of role
debut as well.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a tour de force performance. As Times reviewer
Daniel Cariaga wrote: "The American bass-baritone's ... myriad vocal
and dramatic resources, remarkably demonstrated as the enigmatic,
many-faceted Bluebeard and as the genius-scoundrel Schicchi, had to
thrill even the observer who knew in advance the scope of these
challenges. Ramey is a national treasure."</TE>
<TE>   As Bluebeard, Ramey is regal and unyielding, yet not without a
hint of yearning, suggesting the secrets he and his grisly castle
hold. The Duke's undeniable carnality explains why the young Judith
(Denyce Graves) cannot resist him, despite the tales she has heard
about the wives that have gone before her. Ramey's Bluebeard is both
captor and captivating.</TE>
<TE>   Friedkin's vision called for a particularly dark interpretation of
the role. "His idea was that this guy's a serial killer," Ramey says.
"Usually, the wives are alive and Judith is just escorted and locked
up in the room; he's a collector."</TE>
<TE>   Working with Friedkin turned out to be a pleasantly collaborative
experience for the veteran singer. "We really came up with things
together," Ramey says. "I don't know what I was expecting; I'd never
worked with a film director before. But he didn't work that
differently from the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Ramey's Schicchi is from a different universe than his Bluebeard.
He is lithe and jaunty, an ingenious rogue and a creature of whimsy.
Indeed, when Ramey makes his entrance in the second opera, his look
and style of movement are so different it's almost difficult for the
audience to recognize that it's the same singer.</TE>
<TE>   Puccini's lushly romantic music doesn't necessarily lead the
audience to expect humor. "The comic roles I've done are not anything
like this one," he says of the rarely produced opera, Puccini's only
comedy. "It's groundbreaking for me. I'd only seen it once, and that
was seven or eight years ago in Chicago. But it's been fun and very
interesting. I just experimented during rehearsals."</TE>
<TE>   He's quick to share credit, in this case with Friedkin. "He said,
'Think of this as one of those old MGM musicals,' " Ramey says. "He
wanted everything very expansive, with gestures."</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the production, Schicchi does a little jig of
glee. "That was something Bill Friedkin came up with," Ramey says.
"We had a brunch at his house the first week we were all here
rehearsing. He said, 'I want to show you something,' and he took me
up into his office and put on a tape of 'The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre.' There was a scene where this old guy starts laughing, and he
does this funny dance. And Bill said, 'I want you to do something
like that at a certain point. Try to figure out something like that.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Born in Colby, Kan., (population 5,000) and based in Chicago,
Ramey is one of American opera's home-grown stars. An undeniably
magnetic presence onstage, with a bass so seductive it can make opera
converts upon a single hearing, he is equally gentlemanly and elegant
offstage.</TE>
<TE>   He can also be surprisingly reticent. Although many performers
like nothing better than to talk about themselves, he's often
reluctant to do so, a trait that suggests Midwestern good manners or
maybe just modesty.</TE>
<TE>   Ramey attended Wichita State University, followed by training
programs at Central City Opera in Colorado and Santa Fe Opera in New
Mexico. He made his New York City Opera debut in 1972 and took his
first Metropolitan Opera bows in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Just recently turned 60, Ramey--who first appeared with L.A. Opera
in 2000, as Mephistopheles in Guonod's "Faust"--is in the fourth
decade of a career that has regularly taken him to the world's most
prestigious venues, including the Metropolitan Opera, La Scala, the
Royal Opera and Covent Garden. He is commonly billed as the most
recorded bass of all time.</TE>
<TE>   Ramey is perhaps best known for his devil roles, particularly the
Guonod and the title role in Boito's "Mefistofele," both of which he
began singing in the 1970s and has sung more than 200 times each. He
also has a solo show, "Date With the Devil," in which he sings 14
devil, or at least devilish, arias.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Ramey is by no means limited to the dark and brooding bass
parts. His repertoire is broad, a versatility encapsulated by the
"Duke Bluebeard's Castle" and "Gianni Schicchi" pairing.</TE>
<TE>   He has, for instance, performed in such works as "Don Giovanni,"
"The Marriage of Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." Admittedly, he
has performed lighter works less often than dark, particularly at the
Met. But that's probably because there's simply more dark-hued bass
repertoire from which to choose.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done very much comedy at the Met," he says. "But I feel
at home in both drama and comedy. People who know me know I can be
silly and funny."</TE>
<TE>   And he continues to seek new challenges. "I've done a number of
new roles this past season," notes Ramey, who will return to L.A.
Opera in the fall to sing the villains in Jacques Offenbach's "The
Tales of Hoffmann," directed by Marta Domingo. "I'm glad this year's
over, because it's been a difficult year with all the new
repertoire."</TE>
<TE>   Even in a year of new challenges, however, the Bartok-Puccini
double bill stands out as arguably the most daunting. "I was telling
a friend about this and he just said, 'Why would you want to do
that?' " Ramey recalls, with a twinkle in his blue eyes and a glimmer
of nearly Schicchi-like delight at his triumph in the assignment.
"But I've certainly enjoyed doing it."</TE>

<HD>Dudzick's 'King O' the Moon' Explores the Trials of a 1969
Family</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pleasures of shrewd craftsmanship distinguish "King O' the Moon,"
receiving its local premiere in a McCoy Rigby Entertainment
presentation at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. Tom
Dudzick's self-contained second installment in a semiautobiographical
trilogy, begun with "Over the Tavern," pivots his Polish American
Pazinski family's transitions against those of a tumultuously
changing era.</LD>
<LD>   The year is 1969, the action spinning around the July journey of
Apollo 11, with televised NASA-speak pouring from the Pazinski
domicile above the family-owned Buffalo tavern at curtain's rise.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the treehouse dominating Gary Wissmann's excellent
backyard set merges narrative function with overarching metaphor, so
do these historic transmissions hilariously juxtapose with human
exclamations of more intimate import.</LD>
<TE>   These emit from the tool shed, where eldest Pazinski son Eddie
(Shannon Stoeke) and pregnant bride Maureen (Stacey Martino) have
gone, seeking some uninhibited cohabitation before the drafted Eddie
departs for Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   His uneasily married sister Annie (Audrey Wasilewski) would gladly
ignore this hot-to-trot pair, if only her tenuous equilibrium would
cooperate. The youngest Pazinski, mentally challenged Georgie (Damien
Midkiff), registers excitement in every direction, beginning with the
arrival of second-born son (and authorial surrogate) Rudy (Marc
Valera).</TE>
<TE>   Rudy has gone AWOL from seminary to attend the annual memorial for
deceased Pazinski patriarch Chet, for which the antiwar-prone Rudy is
designated deliverer of the State of the Family Address. Linchpin to
this charged dynamic is widowed mother Ellen (Robin Pearson Rose),
whose plate is full, and then some.</TE>
<TE>   Between the sibling rivalry of the politically diametric Eddie and
Rudy, former school scapegoat Annie's antipathy toward former bad
girl Maureen, and Georgie's affinity for squirreling away family
mail, potential conflicts lurk in every corner. As does family friend
Walter (Michael Rothhaar), recently developed into more than a chum
to the pragmatic Ellen. This distraction permits her to put off the
thought that this reunion could be the family's last.</TE>
<TE>   I missed "Over the Tavern" when it played this venue last season;
in description the 1959 pre-Vatican II setting sounds like a Catholic
equivalent to Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs." "King O' the
Moon" more clearly approximates the template (if not the
incisiveness) of Lanford Wilson's Talley family chronicles,
particularly in the controlled dialogue and smoothly excavated
motives.</TE>
<TE>   The accomplished cast handles this well, with Rose's exemplary
Ellen grounding the enterprise with her uncluttered honesty.
Wasilewski's comic brashness conceals years of hurt, and Martino's
earthy outsider is most ingratiating.</TE>
<TE>   Valera's soulful insouciance works well against Stoeke's desperate
braggadocio, and Rothhaar makes his potentially hackneyed character
ring authentic. Likewise, though Dudzick's positioning of Georgie
borders on formula, Midkiff's invested portrayal largely overrides
the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   This imbalance impacts upon the darker issues at play, their
significance softened by Dudzick's comic contrivances, which are
gently amusing at best, overly sunny and irrelevant at worst.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Casale's efficient but overly leisurely direction indulges
these discrepancies, with the handling of curtain moments lacking
point.</TE>
<TE>   Still, while no masterwork, the congenial populist style
recommends "King O' the Moon," with the future complications hinted
at throughout boding well for the final installment, "Lake Effect,"
which finds the Pazinskis coping with the Buffalo Blizzard of '77.</TE>

<HD>Once a Master Ensemble, Now a Jack of All Trades</HD>
<DH>The struggling group Aman is spread thin in its smorgasbord
sampler 'Remade in America.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For anyone waiting for a big comeback from Aman, the veteran folk
ensemble that has fallen on financial and aesthetic hard times,
Sunday night's program at the Ford Amphitheatre did not end the
vigil. It was a scattershot, fairly tepid fare, sparsely attended and
danced by the company's six members and several guests. In Aman's
heyday a few decades ago, audiences flocked to see dozens of
performers do an eclectic range of dances from around the world.</LD>
<LD>   The key phrase here may be "a few decades ago." With an increasing
number of expert local dancers based in many traditions now in
residence in the Los Angeles area, plus the constantly touring
companies that bring the world's best into town, perhaps the time of
the cultural sampler attempted by one group is over. Certainly the
onstage musicians, who sailed through down-home Appalachian tunes and
Greek or klezmer interludes but floundered when asked to become an
African or classical Indian ensemble, can sense a problem here.</LD>
<TE>   The smorgasbord approach wasn't at all aided by Aman's use of a
narrator who mouthed banalities about cultural diversity in the tones
of an aspiring spokes-model nor by the putative theme "Remade in
America." This was a vague enough concept when it was first called
"The Immigrants" a few years ago (some revisions have been made, but
this program is very similar to the one seen at the Alex Theatre in
Glendale in October 1999).</TE>
<TE>   Yes, there are generations of immigrants here who straddle
cultures and relate to dance and music in complex ways, but what's
the particular point here? Aman bounced blithely from the
theatricalized folk tradition of Moiseyev ("Armenian Dance," "Bottle
Dance," "Russian Spoon Dance," etc.) to a South African gumboot
dance, to a South Asian folk-classical romp, to salsa, to a
clogging-tap-dancing finale.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, dancers seemed on solid ground during some flashy
turns: Youri Nelzine and Lilia Babenko in "Russian Spoon Dance"; Gary
Larsen's dynamite footwork in "Dances of Rhythm"; and a "Salsa/Mambo"
celebration of gloriously rolling torsos and hips by Seaon Bristol,
Joel Massacott and Lesley Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were all the moments of dancers trying to "get" a
tradition, stepping into unfamiliar gumboots or doing a gloss on
bharata natyam style while a musician tries to make a guitar sound
like a sitar. It's time for artistic director Rosina Didyk to rethink
what Aman International Dance and Music can do really well.</TE>

<LD>A producer in relentlessly competitive Hollywood for 30 years, David
Foster immediately wondered, when he got an early submission of a
novel called "Hart's War," who else had a copy. As it turned out, one
of the rival bidders for the John Katzenbach book was someone he knew
all too well: producer Gary Foster, his eldest son.</LD>
<LD>   Gary eventually decided to back off, partly "out of respect for
the old man," as he puts it. But today, even though David gives his
son a big kiss when he arrives at lunch, the father's and son's
competitive juices still simmer.</LD>
<LD>   Recalling their mutual pursuit of the book, the elder Foster
boasts that he had the inside track on the project "since I'm
probably friendlier with Katzenbach," having made a movie out one of
the author's earlier books. Bristling a bit, Gary Foster retorts:
"You know, Dad, I produced a movie from one of Katzenbach's books
too."</LD>
<TE>   Second-generation Hollywood producers are taught survival skills
at an early age. When producer Richard Zanuck was a boy, his father,
20th Century Fox czar Darryl Zanuck, delighted in trouncing him in
checkers. So it's no surprise that one of Gary Foster's enduring
memories is being on the golf course with his father after Gary had
hit a long drive down the fairway. David teed up his ball, waggled
his driver and then stopped cold, as if he'd picked the wrong club.
"Finally my father says, 'All I can think of is I've got to hit it
farther than he did!' "</TE>
<TE>   With Father's Day coming this Sunday, it seems like a perfect
opportunity to hear war stories from men of two Hollywood generations
as they discuss their craft, their career ups and downs and the fine
art of forging relationships with tempestuous actors and directors.</TE>
<TE>   Blustery and emotional, his speech peppered with expletives, the
elder Foster, 72, is a classic old-school producer; he's still mad at
MGM for botching the marketing campaign on "Hart's War" earlier this
year. After starting in Hollywood as a publicist, he turned to
producing in the early 1970s, making such films along the way as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," "The Getaway," "Short Circuit," "The Mask
of Zorro," "Collateral Damage" and "The Core," which is due this fall
from Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   His son Gary, 41, is new-school: calm, thoughtful,
consensus-oriented. His producer credits include "Sleepless in
Seattle," "Tin Cup" and "The Score." His latest film, "Daredevil,"
which stars Ben Affleck as a Marvel comic action hero, is due out
next year. "They are really what producers should be: creative,
fiscally responsible and steeped in a real knowledge of film," says
Paramount studio chief Sherry Lansing, who has worked with both men.
"When we had the premiere for Gary's movie, 'The Score,' I remember
seeing David and saying, 'How nice of you to show up.' And he thought
I was nuts. I had no idea they were related, which is probably the
biggest compliment you could give. They completely have their own
identities."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, it helps to grow up on the inside, where you can see
up-close how the game is played. David Foster says his three sons are
all "movie brats." Greg is president of Imax Films Entertainment, and
Tim runs a company that operates a TV and film production facility in
Zagreb, Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm out of town," dad says, "they all try to call me and tell
me the weekend grosses before I find out."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has always been a family business. In the 1920s, MGM
titan Louis B. Mayer hired David Selznick, then married to Mayer's
daughter, as his head of production. Selznick's ascension was
described by wags of the time as "the son-in-law also rises."</TE>
<TE>   When Harry Cohn ran Columbia Pictures, his key lieutenant, Sam
Briskin, hired his brother-in-law, Abe Schneider, later the studio's
president, who in turn hired his brother-in-law, Leo Jaffe, who
became a top executive as well.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider's son, Burt, went on to produce "Easy Rider," while
Jaffe's son, Stanley, eventually ran a studio and produced hit
movies. Zanuck not only hired his son as studio president, he fired
him too. The younger Zanuck became a prolific producer, working in
recent years with his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, and now his son, Dean,
who shares a producer's credit with dad on "The Road to Perdition," a
Tom Hanks film due in July.</TE>
<TE>   There have been innumerable father-and-son actors, most famously
Kirk and Michael Douglas. There are also father-and-son producers
(Alan Ladd Jr. and David Ladd) and father, son and daughter directors
(Francis, Roman and Sofia Coppola).</TE>
<TE>   When David Foster's sons were growing up, it was not unusual for
them to find actors like Steve McQueen or Richard Pryor at their
house, having dinner with David and his wife, Jackie, or watching a
boxing match on TV. Gary went to USC film school, but much of his
education came from visiting his father's sets, where he worked as a
gofer and production assistant before graduating to producing.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager, he'd read the scripts his father brought home,
amazed to see scrawled notes on nearly every sentence of each page.
"The whole script was covered in ink," Gary recalls. "Seeing how he
valued the printed word really made a big impression on me."</TE>
<TE>   Producers are master problem solvers, so I asked the two how they
would handle a hypothetical crisis: Your $5-million director is
stressed out, he doesn't have a strong point of view, and he's
bickering with his star. The crew is ready to mutiny. What do you do?</TE>
<TE>   "I've had that experience," David says. "The key is to keep it in
the family and solve the problems among yourselves. When I go into
the director's trailer, I say right away, 'I'm not going to tell the
studio about this, unless it keeps up, because if they find out,
they'll can you and you'll be dead in this town.' And then I get the
director of photography and the assistant director in there and
basically say, 'Let's do this together. What do we need to do to get
through tomorrow?' "</TE>
<TE>   Gary goes another route; he tries to get at the source of the
problem. "The director is going to be defensive, so you have to try
to figure out--is it an emotional issue? A personal issue? Then you
make your case. You essentially say, 'I wouldn't be a good producer
if I didn't tell you that you're not delivering what we talked about
when we started the movie.' It's important to bolster the crew's
enthusiasm too, so maybe I'd get the director to cut together some
footage to show the crew to remind them why they're there and get
them pumped up again."</TE>
<TE>   Both men pride themselves on their good relations with talent. The
elder Foster always takes his movie's star out to dinner before
filming begins to find some connection to build a relationship on. If
he has to say no, he does it in a nonconfrontational way.</TE>
<TE>   When Steve McQueen was making "The Getaway," the star ignored the
studio's edict against racing his motorcycle on off-days. David says
he told him, 'Steve, it's not about you. It's about the hundreds of
people who'd be out of work if you crashed.' And he stopped."</TE>
<TE>   When Gary was shooting "The Score" in Montreal, he had to ride
herd on the inimitable Marlon Brando. "Marlon's a tester. He wants to
know his limits," Gary says. "On our first day of filming, he wanted
to change the schedule from a jazz club scene to an outdoor action
scene. I told him we couldn't get the permits on such short notice.
And Marlon said, 'I bet you $1,000 you can.' I told him it couldn't
be done. If I'd said OK, whatever you want, it would've caused chaos.
So I let him express anything to me he wanted, but I also established
early on that if he asked for something unreasonable, I'd say no."</TE>
<TE>   Father and son agree that the movie business is more unforgiving
than ever about failure. "On Monday morning, either you get
congratulatory calls or the phone doesn't ring at all," Gary says.
"It definitely helped me seeing Dad go through it. He's a very
emotional guy, and I remember getting calls from people who'd just
been on the phone with him, who'd say, 'He's going crazy.' And I'd
think, is that the way I want to handle it? I'm probably a lot more
stoic about the ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   Even after all his years in the business, David admits he's still
devastated by a flop, though his sons, being in the business
themselves, often help ease the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "You spend years working on a picture, and it can be over in a
weekend," he says. "I could never handle it without my wife and sons.
They all call and tell me the critics are full of [it]. It makes me
feel better, even if I know that sometimes they're lying."</TE>

<HD>For Network News, Finding Younger Viewers Is a Gray Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the youth-obsessed world of television, network news divisions are
wrestling with an age-old problem: how to get younger viewers to
watch TV news.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing a decades-long trend, younger viewers simply have less
time to devote to news than older ones and less interest in it. The
median age for NBC anchor Tom Brokaw's audience this TV season, for
example, is 56.7, compared with 58.7 for ABC's Peter Jennings and
60.3 for CBS' Dan Rather, according to Nielsen Media Research
figures.</LD>
<LD>   NBC recently announced with much fanfare that Brian Williams, 43,
will take over the anchor chair from Brokaw at the end of 2004, the
first transition atop a nightly network newscast in two decades. Yet,
if the presumption is that a younger face will bring in younger
viewers, it may be mistaken. During May, the median age of Williams'
MSNBC audience was 60, older than that watching Brokaw.</LD>
<TE>   Given the emphasis on reaching younger audiences by advertisers,
who want to establish brand loyalty among young adults and hold onto
them for life, making news more appealing to those demographics
remains an issue for news divisions. The formula for doing it,
however, remains elusive, particularly if it means reeling in that
audience without sacrificing core news viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, people become more interested in news as they get
older, said Alan Wurtzel, NBC's head of research. But some pessimists
think that model is about to fall apart. Those in their 20s and 30s
have grown up on a news-on-demand diet, providing them
round-the-clock options such as cable and the Internet, as well as
alternative news sources that include reality shows, MTV and
late-night comedians.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some in news worry that younger viewers may not as
readily develop the nightly news habit. Indeed, one of the youngest
news audiences these days, with a median age of 51 last month, can be
found watching CNN Headline News, with its frenetic,
information-filled screens and 15-minute headline cycles. "NBC
Nightly News" is the only network newscast whose median age has
dropped this season compared to last in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, as the young people who tuned in to learn about
those events drifted away or stuck with cable.</TE>
<TE>   "People of my generation grew up with the habit and are now news
watchers," said consultant and former network executive Jeff
Gralnick, who is 63. Those in their 20s, 30s and 40s "didn't grow up
with the habit.... As these people age into their later 40s and 50s
... they know they can get news from other places when they need it."</TE>
<TE>   Williams fits the traditional network anchor model: a serious
white man who wears impeccable suits and has spent a career moving
his way up the news ladder, from local stations to his stint as NBC's
White House correspondent to his current job as anchor on a very
traditional-looking newscast on cable's MSNBC. He is getting more
international experience too, traveling to India last week to report
on tension there.</TE>
<TE>   Still, research indicates that younger viewers don't automatically
crave the Walter Cronkite-like father figure that the previous
generation was raised on. "Older viewers grew up being guided by an
anchor, while younger viewers are used to self-selecting their own
news," Wurtzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than follow anchors, research shows that younger people are
"much more interested in the stories and what they consider to be the
honesty of the stories," said Phyllis McGrady, who oversees
newsmagazines and documentaries for ABC News. Younger viewers, she
said, want to know that the reporters have been on location with a
story and that "they have lived and breathed it."</TE>
<TE>   TelePrompTers, flashy satellite links and "all the gadgetry and
wizardry of television" also no longer impress young viewers the way
they did their parents, noted Erik Sorenson, president of MSNBC,
which had a median age in May of 54, young for the news world.</TE>
<TE>   Wurtzel said it is folly for network newscasts to chase after
younger adults. He conducted research in the past on whether it would
be worthwhile to develop a newscast specifically for the 18- to
34-year-old crowd and learned that "the answer is no." While a
newscast could be designed to appeal to that age, he said, "because
of a combination of interests, lifestyle and behavior, we predicted
they would not become loyal enough viewers to make it viable....
Getting them to watch traditional network television news is very,
very difficult, if not impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Networks also can't be seen as pandering to younger viewers,
executives said. ABC was accused of doing just that on the
newsmagazine "ABC Downtown," with its crew of leather-jacketed
correspondents. McGrady maintains that the show did have a younger
style, but that it wasn't at the expense of substance.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there are perils to changing too quickly. When it
launched three years ago with new anchors and a raft of young
contributors, CBS' "The Early Show" attracted a younger audience but
quickly lost older viewers. "Two-thirds of the people who left us
were 65-plus, so they just obviously tuned in, saw the new cast of
characters ... and said, 'This isn't what I bargained for,' " said
CBS News President Andrew Heyward, who would love to attract more
young viewers to the "CBS Evening News" but "not at the expense of
the core audience."</TE>
<TE>   So other than increasing promotion and putting anchors on Don
Imus' morning radio show and late-night comedy shows, what's a
network to do?</TE>
<TE>   Evolve slowly, executives said, as they have done in recent years
by adding more lifestyle, health and finance stories. CBS' newscast
has consciously developed and showcased a handful of youthful
reporters, said Heyward, "which makes the whole program feel younger
and more contemporary." CBS' "48 Hours" will get its own makeover in
the fall with Rather's decision to no longer be the host. One
possible change is doing away with a host altogether, in line with
what younger viewers seem to expect.</TE>
<TE>   A dissenting voice comes from Paul Slavin, executive producer of
ABC's "World News Tonight." He is largely dismissive of pursuing
younger audiences, noting that the first half of the newscast is all
about the day's events and wouldn't change no matter who is being
targeted. During the program's latter half, when there is more
discretion, "I need to find as many viewers as I possibly can. And I
need to be as inclusive as I possibly can. It's about doing as many
stories about pop culture as about pharmaceutical drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Like other networks, ABC News started its own Web site partly to
gain "entree to a group of younger information users who were not
necessarily television watchers," said Gralnick, who has worked for
both ABC and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is make them consumers of your news and begin to
pre-brand them by exposure to your news on the Internet site, and
then lure them to the TV side," a strategy that could be
self-defeating, he added, if viewers decide they get enough news from
the Web and don't need more from TV.</TE>

<HD>Restoring a Silent Treasure</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia from Douglas Fairbanks, an amazing collection
all but forgotten in storage, is nurtured back to life at the motion
picture academy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the silent film era, Douglas Fairbanks was Hollywood royalty--both
on and off the screen. Handsome, dashing, athletic and debonair, he
performed amazing feats of derring-do in one hit swashbuckler after
another during the 1920s. His private life was equally colorful. He
and his wife, superstar Mary Pickford, held court at their palatial
mansion, Pickfair, and attracted throngs of fans when they traveled
the world.</LD>
<LD>   Fairbanks also played a key role in the founding of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 75 years ago and was the
organization's first president.</LD>
<LD>   But surprisingly, given his importance in Hollywood and his Oscar
history, the academy's Margaret Herrick Library--one of the most
comprehensive film archives in the world--housed only a meager
collection of Fairbanks' papers and photographs.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, says the library's photo curator, Robert Cushman, it was
the weakest of the library's collections for major silent film stars.</TE>
<TE>   That changed with the recent donation of a rare collection of
Fairbanks' papers, photographs and scrapbooks. The collection,
donated by Fairbanks' daughter-in-law Vera, is one of the most
important the academy has received in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Cushman acts like a proud parent as he starts going through the
four boxes resting on a table in a conference room in the library,
pulling stills from such Fairbanks classics as "The Black Pirate,"
"Thief of Bagdad" and "The Mark of Zorro."</TE>
<TE>   The boxes also contain pictures from his early stage work and
candid photos of Fairbanks with Pickford; with his only child,
Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; and with such friends and peers as Charlie
Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Jackie Coogan.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a massive 28-pound scrapbook that was assembled for
Douglas Jr. after the death of his father at age 56 in 1939. The
scrapbook, which is in near flawless condition, features telegrams,
letters and newspaper clippings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a who's who of Hollywood," says academy acquisitions
archivist Howard H. Prouty. "We get a lot of scrapbooks, but the
great majority of them are falling apart. I think this one was
probably not much looked at. This is so methodically put together, it
is obviously the work of a very efficient secretary."</TE>
<TE>   Collection's Survival Called Small Miracle</TE>
<TE>   Before the arrival of the collection, the academy acknowledged
Fairbanks' contributions to it by naming the Fairbanks Center for
Motion Picture Study for him on the academy's 75th anniversary.
Cushman says the academy thought that naming the building for
Fairbanks "would be highly appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   "He's also one of the few silent stars people are still interested
in. He was a combination of someone who was very brash but bright,
altruistic, athletic and optimistic. All of that was wrapped up in a
bundle of great good humor."</TE>
<TE>   That the collection survived in good shape is something of a
miracle.</TE>
<TE>   For five decades it was housed in various Bekins storage
facilities in and around the Los Angeles area. Before that, the
collection had been stored at the Fairbanks Ranch in Rancho Santa Fe.
"It was an enormous property that Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford
acquired in the '20s and which has now become a huge development,"
says Cushman.</TE>
<TE>   Vera Fairbanks, who was married to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. from 1991
until his death in 2000 at age 90, opened the boxes last year when
the collection was being appraised for estate tax. "We opened one of
these cartons and these things were crawling around." She thought the
appraiser was going to jump out of his skin.</TE>
<TE>   "We left it there and I called up Orkin Pest Control and I
described the situation. They thought it was lice and they said get
some mothballs and wrap them in cheesecloth and put them in the
boxes."</TE>
<TE>   Prouty accompanied Fairbanks to the storage area, where they spent
an entire day unpacking all the boxes and putting the mothballs in
every cartoon. The strangest thing, says Fairbanks, is that the bugs
didn't seem to find the photographs or the scrapbooks appetizing.
"They ate around the photographs," she says. Fairbanks is hoping to
find more material and is sending Cushman another box of photographs
and original 8-by-10-inch negatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Not having been in this business at all--I am in the field of
retailing--I asked Robert what's so precious about these negatives,
and he said it is the closest thing to the person you can get without
the person being there."</TE>
<TE>   Cushman spread on the conference table an array of archival prints
that were made the week before from original negatives.</TE>
<TE>   Breathtaking in their quality and clarity, the photos are from
Fairbanks' "Robin Hood." There are also some undated portraits from
the early '20s shot by Woodbury, a well-known photographer of the
era.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably won't print all of them because not all of them are
worth it," he says. "We read the negatives and look ... for quality,
content and sharpness. We have maybe 300 negatives. It shows you how
great these original negatives were. Almost nobody shoots them
anymore. It hasn't been used in the commercial film industry for 50
years."</TE>
<TE>   Represented in the photo collection are numerous stills from the
movies Fairbanks made at Paramount-Artcraft from 1917 to 1919,
including "Bound in Morocco," "The Knickerbocker Buckaroo" and "Mr.
Fix-It." These photographs in particular are rarities, says Cushman.</TE>
<TE>   The Paramount-Artcraft stills were glued into scrapbooks. "Luckily
they came out of these albums very easily and they are in gorgeous
condition," says Cushman.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the Artcrafts were identified," he said. "I pulled what
we had on them and printed out the American Film Institute catalog on
each one and, based on [that], I managed to identify everything. It
took a lot of doing."</TE>
<TE>   But the work is far from over. In fact, Cushman says, it will take
one to two years for the collection to be ready for scholars.</TE>
<TE>   The stills that were in folders need to be cleaned because, after
50 years in storage, a fine dust has settled on them.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't see it, but you can feel it," says Cushman. "We are
going to have to clean each one."</TE>

<LD>   Former Beatle and Fiancee Meet the Press</LD>
<LD>   As cameras flashed, Paul McCartney kissed his fiancee, Heather
Mills, and handed her a red rose Monday outside the gates of Castle
Leslie, the remote 17th estate in Glaslough Village, Ireland, where
they are set to wed today.</LD>
<TE>   "As you know, there is going to be a wedding tomorrow, but it is a
secret," joked McCartney, 59, referring to the fact that the venue's
loose-lipped proprietor revealed their nuptial plans to the media
last week.</TE>
<TE>   According to McCartney spokesman Geoff Baker, the couple will be
married by a local priest at the estate's St. Salvator's church
before throwing a lavish party for 300 guests at the castle.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers were upset with what they perceived as a lack of support
for their economy. "They are sourcing nothing at all at the local
level," said florist Aileen Scott, miffed that flowers had been
shipped in from Holland. "Even the castle staff have been sent away
so that they can bring in outsiders."</TE>

<TE>   Brandy Following  in Ozzy's Footsteps</TE>
<TE>   MTV finally re-signed Ozzy and family for another season of the
hit series "The Osbournes." But while fans are waiting for those
episodes to be shot, the network hopes they'll while away their time
with ... Brandy.</TE>
<TE>   That's right: The 23-year-old R&amp;B singer and former star of UPN's
"Moesha" is opening her life for what MTV calls a "documentary
miniseries" called "Diary Presents: Brandy--Special Delivery."
Premiering June 18 at 10:30 p.m., the show will "document the daily
life of Brandy as she balances her marriage, career, family and
impending motherhood," the network said.</TE>
<TE>   Keyes Dropped From MSNBC Prime Time</TE>
<TE>   Continuing its prime-time overhaul, cable news channel MSNBC on
Monday announced a new lineup that doesn't include conservative Alan
Keyes, whose show--launched in January--has become a ratings
disappointment. The network said it is talking to Keyes about a
daytime slot.</TE>
<TE>   The new schedule, as of July 15, includes "Nachman" at 4 p.m.,
hosted by Jerry Nachman, who is also MSNBC's new editor in chief. It
will be followed at 5 p.m. by a show from Phil Donahue, then
"Hardball With Chris Matthews" and "Ashleigh Banfield: On Location."
To give West Coast viewers a chance to see them in prime time, the
Donahue, Matthews and Banfield programs will then repeat in
succession from 8 to 11 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, Jeff Cohen, the founder of Fairness &amp;
Accuracy in Reporting, is leaving the liberal media watchdog group to
become a senior producer for "Donahue."</TE>
<TE>   Miami Picked for MTV's Latino Awards</TE>
<TE>   Miami Beach lost the Latin Grammy Awards to Los Angeles. But now
it's receiving a consolation prize. The city has been selected as the
site of the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards Latinoamerica, which
will take place Oct. 24.</TE>
<TE>   The awards show, the network's first pan-regional event of this
kind, will feature local and international acts tailored for the
Latin market. It will air live on MTV Latin America, with portions of
the program made available to all MTV channels worldwide.</TE>

<TE>   'Mind,' 'Sam,' 'Iris' Are Humanitas Finalists</TE>
<TE>   The feature films "A Beautiful Mind," "I Am Sam" and "Iris" were
among the nominees announced Monday for the 2002 Humanitas Prizes,
honoring movie and TV writers whose work "honestly explores the
complexities of the human experience and sheds light on the positive
values of life."</TE>
<TE>   Episodes of NBC's "The West Wing," ABC's "The Practice" and HBO's
"Band of Brothers" were nominated in the hourlong TV category. In the
half-hour category, the ABC Family channel show "State of Grace"
collected two nominations, along with one for NBC's freshman series
"Scrubs."</TE>
<TE>   In the category for network TV movies, nominations went to ABC's
"Anne Frank," CBS' "Crossed Over" and CBS' "The Rosa Parks Story."
For cable TV movies: HBO's "The Laramie Project," FX's "Sins of the
Father" and Lifetime's "Within These Walls."</TE>
<TE>   The awards, which carry cash prizes ranging from $10,000 to
$25,000, will be announced by the Pacific Palisades-based Humanitas
organization on June 25 at the Hilton Universal.</TE>

<LD>If there ever was a reason to fight the drum-machine wars back in the
'80s, the offbeat delights of technoboffin-popsters I Am the World
Trade Center and house-music rockers VHS or Beta make it hard to
remember what it might have been.</LD>
<LD>   In different ways, both groups drew directly from that
oft-maligned era during their sets at Spaceland on Sunday, melding
disco, new wave and funk into retro-futuristic pop that was campy,
danceable and surprisingly human.</LD>
<LD>   Headliner VHS or Beta also showed an affinity for such modern
electronica acts as Daft Punk during a 45-minute set drawn largely
from the Louisville quintet's self-released debut album, "Le Funk."</LD>
<TE>   Playing mostly instrumental house music on traditional rock gear
rather than using sequencers and machines, they were totally serious
and completely funky.</TE>
<TE>   Before I Am the World Trade Center started its 35-minute set,
singer Amy Dykes quickly explained that she and partner Dan Geller,
who chose their group's title prior to the events of last Sept. 11,
had decided not to change the name, in order to honor the city where
they got started.</TE>
<TE>   Coming more from a new-wave place, the pair (now based in Athens,
Ga.) employed keyboards, a digital theremin, tambourines and both
normal and processed vocals in a delightfully energetic performance
that was a bit like ultra-amped-up karaoke.</TE>
<TE>   That effect was underscored when the pair offered pulsating
renditions of Blondie's "Call Me" and Berlin's "Metro."</TE>
<TE>   But some of the songs from the band's second album, "The Tight
Connection" (released by indie-pop label Kindercore, which Geller
co-founded), were unexpectedly affecting with their musings on the
difficulties and thrills of living in the big city.</TE>

<HD>Study Shows Growth of Arts Groups Is Outpacing Inflation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new study reports that museums, theater troupes, orchestras and
other nonprofit arts organizations around the U.S. grew at twice the
rate of inflation between 1992 and 2000, and now add up to a
$53.2-billion-a-year industry.</LD>
<LD>   The study, based on surveys of 3,000 organizations and 40,000
audience members in 91 cities, was commissioned by Americans for the
Arts, a nonprofit organization with offices in Washington, D.C., and
New York, paid for by American Express and conducted by economists
from the Georgia Institute of Technology.</LD>
<LD>   "People in general don't have any idea of the size of this
nonprofit industry, or its impact," said Robert L. Lynch, president
and chief executive of Americans for the Arts. Titled "Arts &amp;
Economic Prosperity," the new study was designed to detail the
economic spillover of activities by nonprofit arts groups. It
estimates that nonprofit arts groups spent $53.2 billion in fiscal
2000 on expenses from rent to salaries to utilities. That spending,
the study contends, in turn prompted $80.8 billion in additional
spending by audiences at hotels, restaurants, souvenir stands and
elsewhere--$22.87 per audience member.</LD>
<TE>   A similar 1994 study, based on 1992 data, estimated the yearly
spending of nonprofit arts groups nationwide at $36.8 billion. The
new results show a 45% increase, but do not account for inflation of
roughly 22% between 1992 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the areas examined by the study included Glendale
(population 194,973; nonprofit arts group spending of $3.8 million in
2000), Pasadena (133,936; $6 million) and San Diego County (2.8
million, $122.8 million). Researchers said they avoided the cities of
Los Angeles, New York and Chicago "to avoid inflating the national
estimates" of economic impact.</TE>

<HD>A Daring Perspective on 'Jenufa'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With only a single opera in a typical season, performed twice, Long
Beach Opera has to make every production and every performance
matter. This year the opera is Janacek's "Jenufa." Seen Sunday
afternoon at the Carpenter Center of Cal State Long Beach, it
mattered.</LD>
<LD>   "Jenufa," Janacek's first important opera and the first to employ
his distinctive style of emphatically repeated melodic and rhythmic
cells, is also one of the first great psychological works of the 20th
century (it was begun in 1895, completed in 1903 and revised and
modernized five years later).</LD>
<LD>   At its most basic, "Jenufa" is a study in how passions twist,
turn, entwine. Love turns to hate, hate to love. Through intensely
expressive music that reflects the flickering change of emotions as
if it were a kind of aural brain scan, the Czech composer turns his
heroine's struggle to overcome victimization into a kind of epic
theater.</LD>
<TE>   This unaffected village girl, in love with Steva and pregnant with
his son, is also loved by Laca. In a fit of jealousy, Laca cuts
Jenufa's face with a knife, making her no longer attractive to Steva.
Unable to bear seeing Jenufa's life seemingly ruined, her stepmother
kills the baby to pave the way for reconciliation between Jenufa and
Laca. In one of the all-time great triumphs of operatic forgiveness,
Jenufa ultimately embraces Laca and her stepmother. Goodness in
Janacek can only be achieved by transcending violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Jenufa" is mature drama. Long Beach Opera's production team is
four young women, without major opera credits. Their inexperience
showed, perhaps, in their tendency to overemphasize the opera's
emotional intensity. The performance began at a fevered pitch with
the danger of having nowhere to go but down. Yet, despite a few
miscalculations, it didn't. Instead, the talented team found exactly
what it is that makes "Jenufa" gripping theater and didn't let go.</TE>
<TE>   Darcy Scanlin's disorienting set is extraordinary. We look down on
the village from tops of buildings. From this perspective, the back
of the stage is the ground, leaving us in a vertiginous world
skewered by 90 degrees, a point of view that made Janacek's music and
the opera's moral dilemmas all the more unsettling. Only with the
resolution of the drama, and a brilliant sunrise effect (by lighting
designer Geoff Korf), was there relief from this the visual sensation
of vertigo.</TE>
<TE>   Director Isabel Milenski has, on the surface, a relatively
straightforward approach. There is no Postmodern updating, as she and
Scanlin did two years ago in their Long Beach Opera debut, a
small-scale production of Jacopo Peri's 400-year-old opera
"Euridice." Anna Bjornsdotter's elegant costumes seem to move the
opera forward in time maybe half a century, but we are still in a
small Czech town. What is radical is the way Milenski strives to
position every shade of feeling directly in your face and the degree
to which she is able to get the singers to commit themselves to doing
just that.</TE>
<TE>   In the title role, Lisa Willson made the least impressive first
impression of the cast, but she may have been saving herself in this
demanding role. She seemed to find her voice about the same time
Jenufa begins to discover her own inner strength. By the time of her
rapturous final duet with Laca, she sounded an altogether luminous
soprano, silvery and sure.</TE>
<TE>   Willson had extremely strong singers to play off of, and none more
so than Katherine Ciesinski. Her Kostelnicka, Jenufa's stern
stepmother who murders the baby, was a wild, half-crazed presence, a
force of nature. At its extreme, that wildness just about took her
over the top vocally and dramatically, but her skating at the
emotional precipice in an already dizzying  production was dazzling.
Daniel Cafiero brought a swaggering affability to Steva. Roy
Cornelius Smith's impressive tenor made him a powerful Laca. Kathryn
Day was the comforting Grandmother Buryja. Others in the smaller
roles were equally effective.</TE>
<TE>   Matching Milenski's theatrical intensity was that of Andreas
Mitisek's from the pit. Indeed, director and conductor almost seemed
to be egging each other on. That resulted in strong, commanding
playing from the orchestra. But it also meant pushing the singers
ruthlessly. Many oversang to compete with the mighty sound from the
orchestra, sacrificing the text. The opera was sung in English, a
compromise given that Janacek fit his musical lines so closely to
Czech. But little of the English was understood as the singers strove
for volume, and the importance the composer placed upon the text was
even further diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is no denying that this is opera with an immediacy
all too rare. And as a final kudos to the company, the chorus was a
delight singing and executing Tonya Lockyer's imaginative
choreography.</TE>

<LD>Remember those days growing up when the aroma of fine Virginia
tobaccos would waft from your father's walnut-paneled den, where he
would puff away on his meerschaum amid a sportsman's paradise of a
room with fishing rods propped in the corner and the heads of
big-game conquests mounted on the walls?</LD>
<LD>   Well, I don't either, but leave it to the History Channel to honor
its traditional concept of Dear Old Dad with a week of specials aimed
at the classic outdoorsman in his soul.</LD>
<LD>   "Grab your fishing rod, tackle box and sleeping bag and join the
History Channel for a little father-son bonding during 'Modern
Marvels: Gone Fishin' Week,' " is how the channel is promoting its
series of shows that begins tonight at 10 with "The Tackle Box," an
ode to angling.</LD>
<TE>   I can't wait for next Mother's Day, when the programming will
undoubtedly focus on cooking and sewing so mom and sis can have some
special moments of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's hourlong program follows the development of fishing from
a survival tactic for cave dwellers to a billion-dollar leisure
industry that has spawned a million full-time jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A smattering of Egyptian hieroglyphics indicates that when those
folks weren't busying themselves with those silly pyramids, they
spent an awful lot of time dangling lines into the Nile. Innovations
in equipment and techniques through subsequent centuries helped
tremendously to popularize the sport. And nowadays, with ultralight
graphite rods, high-tech lures and even underwater sensing devices,
the poor fish don't seem to stand much chance.</TE>
<TE>   The series, a must-see for outdoorsy types and still interesting
in a historical sense for others, continues through Friday with shows
on hunting, camping and off-road driving. Somewhere on this Father's
Day week, Ernest "Papa" Hemingway must be smiling.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Says Results Were Overstated</HD>
<DH>Cable: Two directors resign as a bankruptcy filing looms,
and auditor Deloitte is dismissed. Revenue, EBITDA and subscriber
count are lowered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already under federal investigation for its questionable accounting
practices, cable television operator Adelphia Communications Corp. on
Monday fired its auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, and restated financial
results for the last two years, acknowledging that the previous
management team had overstated earnings, customer numbers and sales
figures.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to Adelphia's problems, on Monday Leonard Tow and Scott
Schneider resigned from its board after only two weeks of service
because they saw little chance of saving the troubled cable company
from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Tow also complained about the
"unreliability" of Adelphia's financial results, as well as "the
ongoing serial disclosures of wrongdoing."</LD>
<LD>   Also Monday, one of Adelphia's subsidiaries, Century
Communications Corp., filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
Century, in a joint venture, operates cable properties in Puerto
Rico.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts say a bankruptcy filing by Adelphia now is expected
within days. The company already has defaulted on a $45-million
interest payment and faces another deadline Saturday for an
additional $50 million. The delisting of Adelphia's shares on Nasdaq
last week also put the company into default with its bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has been trying to raise $2 billion to avoid bankruptcy,
but potential lenders, investors and buyers have concluded that such
a deal would be too risky given the company's liabilities. Adelphia
faces more than 20 class-action shareholder lawsuits and is under
investigation by federal and state regulators because of $3.1 billion
in loans to the founding Rigas family backed by the company without
shareholder knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be easier in bankruptcy [for Adelphia] to get sales done"
of its cable assets, said Oren Cohen, a bond analyst at Merrill
Lynch. "[The buyer] doesn't have to assume any liability."</TE>
<TE>   Some on Wall Street speculated Monday that Tow might make a bid to
buy some of Adelphia's cable businesses. Tow became the largest
Adelphia shareholder outside the controlling Rigas family when he
sold Century Communications, the largest cable operator in Los
Angeles, to Adelphia in 1999 for about $5.2 billion. Some Adelphia
shareholders were backing Tow as the company's next CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission
reportedly are looking into Deloitte's role as auditor of both
Adelphia and the privately owned Rigas partnerships that used the
corporation to finance its other businesses. For instance, Adelphia
loaned about $150 million to the Rigas' NHL hockey team, the Buffalo
Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   After disclosures in late March of questionable accounting
practices, Adelphia asked federal regulators for an extension to file
its 2001 annual report to give it time to consult with its auditors.
Deloitte refused to sign off on the annual report, and its audit was
suspended after the Rigases stepped down and independent directors
disclosed the first details of the family's self-dealing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia founder John Rigas, 77, resigned as chief executive three
weeks ago. Soon after, his three sons quit from their top management
posts.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rigas family has relinquished control, many
shareholders remain wary of the independent Adelphia board members
who have been running the company since then, including Erland
Kailbourne, the Rigases' hand-picked successor as acting chief
executive. Some Adelphia investors have called for Kailbourne, and
the other three independent board members, to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Allen, the computer billionaire-turned cable mogul, was in
advanced negotiations with Adelphia a week ago to put up about $2
billion in the form of a loan that would entitle him to buy certain
Los Angeles cable systems. Sources said he backed away from the deal
after investors signaled their disapproval by driving down the stock
of his cable company, Charter Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's problems have dragged down the entire cable TV sector.
Charter has been one of the hardest hit as its stock fell 25% in the
last five days; it closed Monday at $4.64, down 51 cents. Shares of
Cablevision Systems Corp., another major cable operator, have fallen
almost 18% in the last five days, while rival Comcast Corp. has seen
its stock fall 12% and Cox Communications' shares have dropped 11% in
the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's stock has plummeted more than 99% since the financial
irregularities were revealed in late March. Adelphia's shares, which
trade over the counter, closed Monday at 18 cents, down 12 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say Adelphia's lenders had agreed to extend more credit to
the company if the Rigas family resigned, but they refused when the
company's problems deepened.</TE>
<TE>   In a regulatory filing Monday, Adelphia said it would cut its
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by
$210 million for fiscal 2001 and by $160 million for 2000. Adelphia
also revised 2001 revenue to $3.51 billion from $3.58 billion, and to
$2.55 billion in 2000, down from $2.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company also lowered its subscriber count to 5.76 million, a
reduction of 47,000.</TE>

<HD>Tenet Profit Will Beat Estimates</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. said that quarterly profit will beat estimates
as the hospital operator treated more patients, raised prices and cut
costs.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara-based Tenet said earnings for its fiscal fourth
quarter ended May 31 will "comfortably exceed" the 90-cent average
forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet, like other U.S. hospital companies, has increased earnings
by raising the prices it charges managed-care insurers and investing
in profitable medical services such as cardiology and orthopedics.
The company also has bought hospitals in growing health-care markets
such as California and Florida.</LD>
<TE>   The fourth quarter is the 10th consecutive period in which Tenet's
earnings grew by at least 20% and the fifth consecutive quarter of
growth of more than 30%, Chief Executive Jeffrey Barbakow said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is scheduled to announce results July 11.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tenet closed up $1.27 to $76.09 on the NYSE before the
news was released.</TE>

<HD>Banks Seek to Void New Credit Card Law</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The measure is designed to let
consumers know how much it costs to carry a revolving balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of banks is suing the state of California in an effort to
block a new credit card disclosure law that is set to go into effect
in July.</LD>
<LD>   The law, which the Legislature passed last fall without industry
opposition, is aimed at telling consumers just how much it costs to
leave a revolving balance on credit cards over time.</LD>
<LD>   Every California credit card customer would get a few standard
examples of the cost of credit with each monthly bill. The disclosure
is likely to read something along the lines of: Based on a 17% credit
card rate and a 2% minimum payment, it would take 40 years and cost
$16,305.34 to pay off a $5,000 revolving credit card balance.</LD>
<TE>   Cardholders who pay only minimum payments for six months or more
would get additional personalized disclosures, labeled "minimum
payment warning." This warning would calculate the long-term cost of
credit by using the cardholder's actual balance and the rate on the
card.</TE>
<TE>   Led by the American Bankers Assn. and Citibank, banks sued late
last month to block implementation of the law, charging that the
statute "is a paternalistic, but misguided and unlawful effort."
Neither the bank group nor Citibank, owned by New York-based
Citigroup Inc., could be reached Monday for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Chase Manhattan Bank issued a statement saying: "The law seeks to
regulate financial institution's lending practices. The law's
constitutionality is the subject of this litigation. We believe the
law is unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the law was largely structured by the banks that are
now suing, said Shelley Curran, a policy analyst with West Coast
regional office of Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a stronger bill that passed the Legislature
in 2000, requesting that the bill be toned down.</TE>
<TE>   The new law largely mirrored a memo titled "Citigroup Amended
Proposal," which was provided to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor signed a good consumer protection bill," said Davis
spokeswoman Hilary McLean. "It's disappointing that the financial
institutions that helped craft the law now have buyer's remorse."</TE>
<TE>   The banks contend in their suit that the intent of the law was to
coerce them to boost minimum monthly credit card payments to 10% of
the balance due--most banks now commonly require minimum monthly
payments of roughly 2%--or be forced to make the disclosures the law
requires.</TE>
<TE>   Dictating monthly payment amounts would violate national banking
laws and the U.S. Constitution, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   "They've turned the whole issue on its head ... ," Curran said.
"This is so disingenuous."</TE>
<TE>   The new law requires banks to provide standard disclosures
explaining what a consumer would pay in total interest and principal
based on sample balances of $1,000, $2,500 and $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately, the bank could choose to do disclosures based on the
actual rate the consumer would be paying on their specific card.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the bank's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Sacramento, is slated for later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Curran said she believes banks oppose the law because cardholders
might pay off their credit card balances more quickly if they knew
what it cost them to carry a balance, and that could cost banks
millions of dollars in lost interest.</TE>

<HD>Disney Sells a $1-Billion Ad Package</HD>
<DH>Media: Multi-network, multi-advertiser deal involves all of
its units and may be the largest ever in the industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. has cemented an estimated $1-billion deal with a
group of major advertisers in what could be the largest ever for a
media company, an advertising executive said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The yearlong agreement guarantees prominence for the advertisers
in shows and upcoming ABC events, including the Super Bowl, the
Academy Awards and next year's NBA playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Disney has been in talks for months to structure the deal with OMD
USA Inc., one of the world's largest advertising buying firms. OMD
represents PepsiCo Inc., McDonald's Corp. Apple Computer Inc.,
Universal Pictures, Gillette Co., Visa and other makers of well-known
brands.</LD>
<TE>   "It's certainly never been done before on this scale and with this
many entities," said Dan Rank, OMD USA's managing partner who handled
negotiations for the advertisers. "This thing touches every single
media unit of the Walt Disney Co. from ABC, ESPN, radio stations, the
radio network and publishing to the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   The multi-network, multi-advertiser package eclipses last year's
$300-million deal between Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Tide
detergent and Crest toothpaste, and Viacom Inc.'s television
properties, including CBS and MTV.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives declined to comment late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to selling commercial time on ABC, ESPN networks, ABC
Family, Lifetime, A&amp;E Networks and other Disney properties, the
Burbank-based company also agreed to joint program-production deals
with advertisers, joint funding of television specials and sporting
events as well as product placements in shows, sources with knowledge
of the deal said.</TE>
<TE>   OMD's Rank would not comment on specific terms or which
advertisers were included in the deal. He also declined to quantify
the rate discount that Disney offered to advertisers who joined the
package.</TE>
<TE>   For Disney, the ABC network, which has struggled in ratings, will
be the largest beneficiary, with the advertisers agreeing to buy up
to $500 million in commercial time on the network, including $300
million during prime-time. The ESPN networks will take in about $150
million, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Such package deals are becoming more common because of the rapid
consolidation of media companies and advertising agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Five media conglomerates own the six top television broadcast
networks and the most popular cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the table, a handful of companies represent
the nation's largest advertisers, making it easier for both sides to
negotiate package deals.</TE>
<TE>   OMD is putting together another so-called cross-platform deal with
AOL Time Warner Inc. properties, although the Disney deal dwarfs that
package.</TE>

<HD>Westside Mall Owners Say Bigger Is Better</HD>
<DH>Macerich, Westfield racing to gobble up rivals</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's mall owners are gobbling up rivals in a race to become
the biggest in the land, and two of the landlords with the biggest
appetites are headquartered in the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   his month, Santa Monica-based Macerich Co. announced the
acquisition of Arizona's largest mall owner, Westcor Realty, for
about $662 million, and Monday said that it had agreed to buy The
Oaks shopping center in Thousand Oaks in a deal valued at about $150
million.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Brentwood-based Westfield America Inc. is digesting the
14 malls, including the prestigious Century City Shopping Center, it
received in January as part of the $2.2-billion acquisition of
Rodamco North America by Westfield and two other mall operators.</LD>
<TE>   While the two Southern California companies are still far smaller
than industry leader Simon Property Group, they are among the fastest
growing in the rapidly consolidating mall business.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody eyes everybody else as a potential competitor for any
portfolio that comes up [for sale]," said Westfield America Chief
Executive Peter Lowy.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich and Westfield are part of an aggressive league of rivals
that have increased their shares of the nation's malls. The number of
players with more than $1 billion worth of mall property has shrunk
by about half during the last decade and is expected to eventually
drop to only a handful, according to industry officials. With most
urban areas already saturated with malls, the most viable way for
mall companies to grow is to own a larger share of the country's top
1,000 regional malls.</TE>
<TE>   Recent acquisitions have dramatically expanded the size and scope
of Macerich and Westfield, which are among the nation's 10 largest
owners of mall and shopping center space.</TE>
<TE>   Westfield, the wholly owned subsidiary of Westfield Holdings of
Australia, is the larger of the two, owning all or part of 61 U.S.
malls with about 60 million square feet of shopping space, and has
maintained a higher public profile. The firm was in the headlines
recently when its effort to rebuild the shopping center that once lay
beneath the destroyed World Trade Center in New York ran into
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Only slightly smaller is the Macerich portfolio, which has more
than doubled in size since the late 1990s. It will include about 55
properties totaling nearly 60 million square feet once pending
acquisitions are completed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being rivals in some regions, Lowy and his counterpart at
Macerich, Chief Executive Arthur Coppola, maintain a friendly
relationship. Retail tenants looking for mall space often split their
day meeting at both companies, which are headquartered a few miles
apart on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unusual for a tenant to spend the morning over there and
the afternoon over here," said Coppola, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola and Lowy, 43, have become leaders in an industry that was
written off in recent years by many who perceived malls as vulnerable
to a host of new competition, ranging from discounters such as
Wal-Mart to online retailers. Despite the many failed and struggling
properties that did not modernize or expand, a regional mall that
dominates its market can be a moneymaker that continues to draw huge
numbers of customers even during a sluggish economy, say industry
observers.</TE>
<TE>   "The death of the mall has been much exaggerated," Lowy said.
"Malls have gotten stronger."</TE>
<TE>   The two firms differ in some marketing strategies. Most notably,
Macerich rejects Westfield's bid to build consumer loyalty by
branding its properties as "Westfield Shoppingtowns." Some industry
analysts said Westfield also stands out in the industry by being more
open to new concepts, ranging from adding rooftop parking to
including big-box retailers in its mix of tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "Westfield seems to be very visionary in terms of their ideas for
their properties," said John Beaney, a senior vice president for Katz
&amp; Associates, a retail real estate consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   The companies share many strategies and strengths.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich and Westfield are considered experts in buying and
turning around second-tier malls after extensive and expensive
renovations. After buying the former Buenaventura mall in Ventura
County, Macerich spent $89 million to virtually rebuild and expand
the property, now known as Pacific View mall.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been a strength of both companies--take existing centers
that have a good market position and remodel, develop and expand
them," said retail industry consultant Rob York at Fransen Co.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich and Westfield also have built concentrations of malls in
certain areas that allow them to cut operating costs, raise rents and
increase their clout with retailers. Westfield, for example,
dominates San Diego County with eight properties. Macerich has a lock
on southeast Los Angeles County with control of Lakewood, Stonewood
and Los Cerritos malls.</TE>
<TE>   "If a tenant wants to come to that ... area, they need to talk to
you," Coppola said.</TE>

<HD>Stock Buys Not Altered by Terror</HD>
<DH>Investing: Some fund managers are sticking to their
purchase strategies. Others add shares with growth potential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund managers say that although terrorism continues to cast a
pall over the stock market, they are not letting it interfere with
their investing decisions.</LD>
<LD>   Some managers interviewed Monday said that they have taken
protective steps by adding defense-related stocks such as Lockheed
Martin Corp. or energy companies that might benefit from a spike in
oil prices, but most said they are sticking to their basic strategies
and staying close to fully invested in stocks.</LD>
<LD>   "Benjamin Graham is our guru, not Osama bin Laden," said manager
Nicholas Gerber of the Ameristock and Ameristock Focused Value funds.
Graham is the legendary "value" investor who wrote the 1934 book
"Security Analysis."</LD>
<TE>   Jittery investors, however, clearly are worried about terrorism
these days, along with the tarnished state of corporate management
and accounting and the uncertain pace of economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks briefly plunged in Monday's trading when Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said a U.S. citizen was arrested last month on charges of
plotting to plant a radiation-spreading "dirty bomb." Major indexes
recovered and finished mostly higher for the day, but analysts said
fears of new terror strikes kept a lid on gains.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no historical precedent for the climate of terror
in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks that left more than 3,000
Americans dead, managers say that buying unloved stocks, especially
during trying times when share prices are depressed, has been a
successful strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Like Gerber, Bill Nygren, who runs the Oakmark and Oakmark Select
funds, said he has not changed his approach to finding
underappreciated companies.</TE>
<TE>   "If we analyze stocks the right way, we have a competitive edge,"
he said. "I don't think we have an edge on anyone when it comes to
guessing about terrorism activity."</TE>
<TE>   Tom McKissick of the TCW Galileo Large Cap Value fund said he and
co-manager John Snider haven't changed their style.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in an environment of massive uncertainty. Nuclear attack,
biological, chemical--anything seems possible," McKissick said. "Did
that stop us recently from buying shares of the Gap, which we think
are undervalued? No."</TE>
<TE>   Added Carl Domino, manager of Northern Large Cap Value fund:
"Other than not being in the stock market, there isn't all that much
we can do. After all, we're paid to be in the market."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some managers say terrorism factors into their
decision-making, at least to a degree.</TE>
<TE>   "I stay away from stocks that are sure to be adversely affected in
the aftermath of another terrorist attack, like the cruise ships and
the airlines," said Jon Burnham, manager of the Burnham fund.
Travel-related stocks were slammed when trading resumed after Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Gustafson, who runs the Liberty Growth Stock fund, said that
although "you cannot allow the terrorist threat to dominate the
investment process, there are certain ways to hedge."</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson has tried to do that through defense industry stocks,
such as Lockheed, which he has built into a major holding. After
years of declining military spending, many analysts expect the sector
to grow for years as the U.S. builds up its defense capability.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson also owns consumer staple stocks such as Philip Morris
Cos., Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc., which are considered
"defensive" in nature because of their perceived steady earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "In a calamity there is no perfectly safe hiding place," he said,
"but these types of stocks have held up relatively well in this
environment."</TE>
<TE>   Domino said he plans to take out "a little bit of an insurance
policy" by adding to his energy holdings. If the U.S. invades Iraq or
oil supplies are otherwise threatened, prices could surge, analysts
say. Domino's holdings in the sector include ChevronTexaco Corp. and
Marathon Oil Corp.</TE>
<TE>   There was little interest in buying gold-mining stocks, the
traditional hedge against disaster. The stocks surged this year as
tensions rose between rivals India and Pakistan, but have weakened
recently.</TE>

<HD>Winnick Touts Plan for Buyout</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Chairman of Global Crossing seeks investors for
rescue effort. The move strikes some as audacious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JAMES GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick, who reaped hundreds of
millions of dollars by selling company stock before Global's dramatic
downfall into bankruptcy this year, is trying to round up investors
to fund a management buyout of the fiber-optic giant.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick's potential involvement in bringing the company out of the
largest telecommunications bankruptcy in history struck some as an
audacious move for a man who had a hand in the firm's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's laughable," said Pat Comack, an analyst at Guzman &amp;
Co. who followed the telecommunications firm until earlier this year.
"I don't think anybody is going to buy into [Winnick's investment
plan].... He's just not a credible figure anymore."</LD>
<TE>   Undeterred by such criticism, Winnick approached Wall Street
investment giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc., private equity firm
Carlyle Group and the investment arm of Blackstone Group to help
finance the management group's restructuring plan, according to a
source close to the interested bidders. All declined to get involved,
the person said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Blackstone Group declined to comment on Winnick's
contact with the company's investment arm. Another part of the firm
is reviewing bids on behalf of Global Crossing. Goldman Sachs could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Carlyle Group said the company was not interested
in bidding on Global as a whole, and is not interested in joining in
the management effort.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how many investors Winnick has approached about
Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Winnick said the Global Crossing founder and
chairman "wants to see the company survive and prosper." Asked
whether any of Winnick's companies would be committing funds to
Global, the spokesman said, "Not as yet. Everything is still in the
development stage." Winnick has made no "personal" commitment to
invest money in the restructuring plan, said Howard J. Rubenstein,
another Winnick spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick has been criticized for reaping more than $575 million in
profit by selling some of his company stock before the telecom
industry imploded amid overcapacity, crushing debt and sinking
demand. He still holds more than 89 million Global Crossing shares,
worth $6 million based on Monday's closing price of 7 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Help from Winnick won't be welcome in places such as Rochester,
N.Y., where Global built its biggest operation by acquiring Frontier
Telephone of Rochester Inc., the local and long-distance telephone
company for the greater Rochester area.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't trust Winnick. The harm he caused was immense. And I
can't imagine any investors who would trust him," said Rep. Louise
McIntosh Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who represents the area and has been
trying to help laid-off workers.</TE>
<TE>   She said a group of former Frontier/Global employees is trying to
raise money to buy back Frontier's long-distance operations. Global
sold the local phone network to Citizens Communications Co.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's creditors, owed more than $12 billion, may end
up welcoming a Winnick-funded management plan, despite the baggage
that might come with it, according to a bankruptcy expert.</TE>
<TE>   For bankers and creditors, the bottom line is to recoup as much
money as possible. Although they would be happy to take Winnick's
cash, creditors probably would balk at any plan that left them with
equity in a company run partly by Winnick, the expert said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Verizon Communications and investors ranging
from Gores Technology Group to Platinum Equity have expressed
interest in salvaging Global and its worldwide fiber-optic
communications network.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia offered to pay a combined $750 million for 79% of the
company, but the deal fell apart at the end of May, when the Asian
companies declined to improve their offer.</TE>
<TE>   Potential buyers must submit bids by June 20 for all or parts of
Global Crossing. The company has until September to come up with its
own reorganization plan.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the company's management has been getting closer to the
once-derided offer by a group of small shareholders to revive the
firm with new money from existing shareholders, people whose
investments are routinely wiped out in any bankruptcy reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   "They're tracking our plan almost exactly," said Kennon A.
Brennen, managing partner of K.A.B. Group in New York. "The company
needs restructuring; some creditors will need to reinvest; the banks
will need to reinvest," he said. "The only difference is that instead
of using shareholder funds, they're selling off non-core assets, but
there's no guarantee of what they can get for those assets."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the management plan relies on the proceeds from the
expected sale of Global Crossing's conferencing business, its
terrestrial network in the United Kingdom and its Global Marine unit,
which installs, maintains and repairs undersea fiber-optic cables.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, meantime, says it has enough cash to see it
through bankruptcy proceedings. It still predicts that a
restructuring will be complete by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Its monthly financial report, filed Friday, shows that the company
had $736 million in cash or cash equivalents on hand at the end of
April, including $262 million held by Asia Global Crossing Ltd., a
58%-owned subsidiary that is not in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The cash total is $44 million less than the total at the end of
March, indicating that the company is curtailing costs and running
through less money in its operations. The cash on hand doesn't
include $383 million in restricted cash, mainly proceeds from the
sale of assets that can be used only with court approval.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's cash position, though slightly down from March,
fell a third from the $1.1 billion it had at the end of February.
Most of that drop covered severance packages and restructuring costs,
a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's loss in April was $163 million, or 17 cents a share,
compared with the March loss of $171 million, or 19 cents a share.
Revenue slid 5% to $266 million.</TE>

<LD>It's a tortured twist of conservative values, but President Bush
seems eager to shrink the role of motherhood in America, pushing
aggressively to mandate 40-hour workweeks for the 14 million women
expected to enter the family welfare system over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   House Republicans concurred last month that even mothers with
infants should work or attend training five days a week. The share of
mothers required to meet the new work mandate would double under the
president's proposals, which the Senate will begin debating this
month.</LD>
<LD>   What's radical about Bush's initiative is that few middle-class
women work this much outside the home. Two in every five of the
nation's 11 million mothers with preschool-age children don't work at
all for wages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
average American worker, man or woman, toils less than 34 hours each
week.</LD>
<TE>   The president's plan would alter childhood as we know it. Who will
watch after the 1.2 million additional youngsters under 5 who would
be forced into 40 hours of child care each week? Few middle-class
children that age put in such a grueling week; the average American
child under 5 spends the equivalent of about three days a week in day
care.</TE>
<TE>   More than 7 million older children already return from school each
afternoon to empty households, according to the Census Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Recent evaluations of state welfare-to-work experiments have
revealed negative repercussions for teenagers as their mothers toil
more and supervise their children less, including poorer school
performance, more acts of delinquency and greater incidence of
substance abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is opposed to new spending on child-care
options, even to support working-poor parents who stay off the dole.
Bush has cut the child-care block grant to states in real dollars.
What would markedly advance children's growth and school readiness is
expanded access to child-care centers, according to a recent study of
welfare families by UC Berkeley and Stanford researchers. But Bush
prefers vouchers that largely reimburse baby-sitters or relatives for
their services.</TE>
<TE>   A fresh poll, commissioned by the nonprofit Annie E. Casey
Foundation, which advocates the rights of disadvantaged children,
details how most voters believe that a paycheck trumps a welfare
check, yet they endorse strengthened work supports, like child care.
A majority of women--56% compared with 44% of men--would boost
welfare spending by one-sixth above current levels.</TE>
<TE>   A political risk for Bush is how governors would react if told
that they must find jobs for an additional 800,000 women within a
stalled economy and with no support from Washington. California's
budget analyst estimated that state taxpayers would have to pony up
$2.2 billion to implement Bush's work proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Senate moderates will be exploring a middle ground, such as a more
realistic work standard, effective training options and quality child
care. The goal should be to advance women's work opportunities while
strengthening their parenting role, a balance pursued by all working
mothers.</TE>

<HD>The Real Sum of All Fears</HD>
<DH>'Dirty bombs' are just one of the nuclear threats that
Americans face.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM C. POTTER and LEONARD SPECTOR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not a matter of "if" but "when" one of our cities confronts a
nuclear emergency. Monday's announcement of the May 8 arrest in
Chicago of an alleged Al Qaeda operative accused of planning to build
a radioactive "dirty bomb" suggests that the date for a domestic
nuclear crisis is rapidly approaching.</LD>
<LD>   Less obvious, however, is the kind of nuclear terrorist threat
about which we should be most concerned.</LD>
<LD>   There are four varieties of nuclear terrorism. In addition to the
seizure of a nuclear weapon by a renegade military faction--the
preferred scenario for Hollywood thrillers--these threats include the
theft of nuclear material for the purpose of fashioning a nuclear
explosive device, the attack on or sabotage of civilian nuclear power
installations or spent fuel storage sites and the matching of highly
radioactive nuclear material with conventional explosives to create
radiological dispersal devices or, in common parlance, "dirty bombs."</LD>
<TE>   All of these nuclear terrorist threats are real, all merit the
urgent attention of the U.S. government and the international
community and all require the significant expenditure of resources to
reduce the likelihood and impact of their occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   The threats themselves, however, are different and vary
significantly in their probability of occurrence, their consequences
for human and financial loss and the ease with which their likelihood
of occurrence can be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   The most immediate threat is apt to arise from the use of a
conventional explosive to disperse radioactive debris.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of tons of radioactive material exist globally, much of
it in the form of spent nuclear fuel. Highly radioactive sources also
are used widely for radiotherapy and diagnoses, to irradiate food,
for agricultural purposes and in industry.</TE>
<TE>   It is estimated that in the U.S. alone there are several million
devices using radioactive material. No reliable inventory of these
materials exists, and a large percentage of them are no longer in
use, have been discarded or are lost. "Orphan" sources from other
countries have turned up repeatedly on the black market and are known
to have been acquired by Chechen rebels in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of nuclear sabotage also is a serious one. Although not
widely know in the West, there were at least four episodes in the
mid-1990s in which nuclear power plants in the post-Soviet states
were the targets of terrorist actions. Three of them involved the
Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania and one had to do with the
Kursk nuclear power station in Russia. There is good reason to
believe that U.S. nuclear power plants also are vulnerable to armed
assault, cyberterror (to disable the plants' safety devices) and
insider malevolence.</TE>
<TE>   Were individuals or groups to succeed in acquiring a sufficient
amount of highly enriched uranium, one also could not rule out their
ability to manufacture a crude but effective nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   What has changed since Sept. 11 is not that it has suddenly become
easier to fashion a nuclear bomb--it hasn't--but that we now must
assume that there are organizations that covet fissile material for
the purpose of detonating nuclear explosives in our cities. The main
obstacle in their path is obtaining highly enriched uranium.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, although less likely than the other nuclear terrorist
scenarios, we must take seriously the need to guard against the theft
of intact nuclear weapons. Of particular concern are relatively small
tactical nuclear weapons, of which thousands exist, none covered by
formal arms control accords.</TE>
<TE>   Today there is an urgent need to assess the full range of nuclear
terrorist threats and invest finite resources where they can have the
greatest impact.</TE>
<TE>   It will be years before we can secure all of Russia's highly
enriched uranium against theft, and it may never be possible to
control every radiological source that might find its way into a
dirty bomb. But it should be possible in a matter of months to beef
up security at U.S. nuclear power plants and prepare the public
psychologically for the manageable dangers from a radiological bomb
attack.</TE>
<TE>   These must be our immediate priorities as we pursue a more
comprehensive plan to compare, assess and combat the multiple threats
posed by the different faces of nuclear terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Arafat, by Feeding on Martyrdom, Dooms His People</HD>
<DH>He should exit the Mideast stage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat should step aside. It is too late for him to reverse
course and play the role of a Nelson Mandela, Gerry Adams or Menachem
Begin--all resistance leaders who originally employed violence but
were able to seize historic opportunities for peace when they arose.
Arafat should step aside, not because the cause of Palestinian
statehood as defined in the Saudi proposal is wrong, but rather
because his consistent failure to hold the moral high ground is an
impediment to its realization.</LD>
<LD>   The last promising moment of Arafat's leadership passed when he
turned his back on the peace proposals of Israeli leader Ehud Barak,
dooming the Oslo accords. Certainly, that proposal was less than what
was needed for full Palestinian self-determination, but it was a
major step, and Arafat's failure to match Barak's courage has left
madly spiraling violence as the only alternative.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat has failed the ultimate test of a revolutionary leader,
which is to take his people past the stage of violence to that of
self-governance. He has lacked the integrity to challenge the
desperation and temporary effectiveness of suicide bombings--tactics
that are ultimately suicidal not only for the individual but for the
cause of Palestinian statehood. He has failed to encourage the
committed and talented youth of Palestine to become honest
administrators, tough negotiators and brave truth-tellers, and
instead has sent them off to die as mute bomb-bearers.</TE>
<TE>   Facing such a dominant army, those who are stateless can only win
by proving their case in the court of world opinion. By embracing the
self-immolation of his own people as their most reliable weapon,
Arafat has failed miserably to do this. By surrendering to the agenda
of the religious fanatics who have long opposed him, as well as the
more secular crazies within his own political coalition, Arafat has
sabotaged the hopes of moderate Israelis and Palestinians and those
who support them abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Rebellion has a long, proud history, in our country and elsewhere,
when fueled by the desire of regular citizens to pursue a normal life
without abuse and threat.</TE>
<TE>   A rebellion that feeds on the allure of martyrdom and the
sacrifice of children, however, can find its end only in more pain
and darkness.</TE>
<TE>   That peace has failed is, of course, not solely the fault of
Arafat. In a betrayal of its best instincts, the Israeli electorate
also turned its back on Barak, embracing instead a bitter opponent of
a dignified peace, Ariel Sharon, who has helped fulfill his own
dismissive prophesies of doom by destroying the Palestinian
Authority. Nor is the state-sanctioned violence of Israel morally
superior to the violence of people who do not have tanks and planes
with which to resist.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who long ignored the plight of the Palestinians
and allowed Arafat to be humiliated by invading Israeli troops in the
past year, is belatedly looking for leaders in the rubble of the West
Bank. And then there is the guilt of the Arab governments, which came
so late with their acceptance of Israeli borders, which denied the
Palestinians the investment capital that could have provided an
optimistic economic alternative to a life rooted in the hopelessness
of permanent refugee camps and which encouraged the flow of money to
religious fanatics who debase Islam into a vehicle for endless war
against nonbelievers.</TE>
<TE>   Even Egypt, which did take major risks for its own peace, hasn't
delivered for the Palestinians. I was in Egypt in the days after the
1967 Six-Day War and heard the cries for even more holy war. How
depressing, then, to travel next to Gaza and see what a hellhole the
Egyptians had made of life there for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Though he may share the blame with a cast of thousands, Arafat
must step off the stage. A new, moderate Palestinian leadership is
desperately required, one that would include sensible leaders like
Nabil Shaath, who survived the recent Cabinet shake-up and who would
hopefully renounce violence.</TE>
<TE>   Absurd as it may sound and as difficult as it would be to switch
gears, this is a time for passive resistance. This is a time for
unarmed mothers and fathers to stand in front of tanks with prayer
books and flowers in their hands, instead of proudly sacrificing
their young to slaughter innocents.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Confusion and political squabbling delayed the start of Afghanistan's
loya jirga, and intimidation and occasional violence marred the
selection of its more than 1,500 delegates. Even so, the battered
nation has shown real enthusiasm for the process of developing a
representative government after more than two decades of Soviet
invasion and control, civil war and rule by the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, clumsy U.S. pressure on Afghanistan's former king to
renounce any return to power angered the onetime monarch's
supporters. In addition, warlords and local thugs have maneuvered
some of their underlings into seats on the council, which will pick a
government to rule until national elections in 2004. But there also
are delegates determined to choose rulers who are committed to the
entire country, not just personal interests.</LD>
<LD>   Times staff writer Paul Watson told the story Sunday of Lawangina
Rahman, a 28-year-old woman who faced down her in-laws and neighbors
in remote southeastern Afghanistan to journey to Kabul as a member of
the council. Rahman's father encouraged her to seek one of the 160
appointments for women and proclaimed the family's determination to
take part in the loya jirga "even if we are killed."</LD>
<TE>   After the Taliban's harsh repression of women, forcing them out of
the workplace and schools and confining them to homes, the provision
for female delegates is an encouraging sign of a new Afghanistan. So
is the large number of girls entering classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Threats by some warlords or remnants of Al Qaeda to disrupt the
grand council must be taken seriously, although Kabul is more
peaceful than the countryside. The United States was mistaken in
insisting that international peacekeepers patrol only in the capital.
Failure to expand the force to other major cities such as Herat and
Mazar-i-Sharif makes it more difficult to break the grip of warlords
and rebuild outside the capital. Truckers shaken down for bribes or
threatened with death won't deliver food needed in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   The central government also is faced with the return of many more
Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran than expected. Nations that
together promised more than $4 billion in aid must follow through.
Civil servants and security forces in the capital are barely getting
paid, and the government has warned that it will depend on donors for
more than 80% of its budget for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Washington and its allies have promised not to turn their backs as
they did after funding the war that drove out the Soviets in 1989.
This time around, what they are funding is the belated creation of a
stable government.</TE>

<LD>Well, unless you're from New Jersey, that was a fun series of
basketball games, wasn't it? We should have paraded last weekend. Of
course, the Nets (that's the name of the pro basketball team
representing Exit 16W off the New Jersey Turnpike) really had no
chance. Cleverly, the Lakers let them get close at times to boost TV
ratings before commercials, as they toyed with Portland and
what's-their-name in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   But this four-game NBA Finals minimum is a sham this year. As a
result, let's proclaim the Lakers three-time champions. This is sweet
for the team and for the immense, disparate city that needs positive
distraction.</LD>
<LD>   Questions: If the Valley secedes, can its residents remain Lakers
fans? And what should Los Angeles do about the rest of America, now
eager to annex to this great city of the Lakers?</LD>
<TE>   Those Eastern teams saw us coming this time. Philadelphia, Toronto
and then Boston lost to avoid playing the Lakers for the
championship. The Charlotte, N.C., team even moved to New Orleans to
get out of the way. Are the New York Knicks still a team?</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey is a cute little place tucked in between Pennsylvania
and the back of the Statue of Liberty that gives New Yorkers
somewhere dirtier to look down on.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Hoboken, Hackensack, Newark, Union City, Elizabeth,
Paterson, Paramus and Trenton, the Garden State has a lot of pretty,
green places--but nothing besides toll roads and antipathy to New
York and Philly to unite the state. Hence, the New Jersey team had a
slim choice of names: Shorts, Shoes, Hoops or Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Lakers have a dynasty, if not a real lake. The league
should just cancel next season, ship the trophy to L.A. and save all
those air fares and rubber shoes.</TE>

<LD>You don't have to embrace secession to recognize the roots of the San
Fernando Valley's campaign in the 1970s Proposition 13 tax revolt and
anti-busing movements. The coalition of homeowner groups and business
interests promoting Valley secession complains about taxes, services,
bureaucracy and a downtown government that's too far away.</LD>
<LD>   But Hollywood? Business leaders there are not agitating for a
breakup. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has yet to take a formal
position, and an informal internal survey found members leaning
against secession 2 to 1. Even the movie studios are taking a
wait-and-see attitude. Homeowner groups on the boundaries have asked
to be removed from the proposed city's borders.</LD>
<LD>   And Hollywood is not a mountain range away from downtown City
Hall. It is smack in the middle of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Scratch the fast-moving Hollywood secession movement and you find
not a group but the individual who unapologetically wants to be the
new city's mayor, millionaire nightclub owner and promoter Gene La
Pietra.</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood's secession petition came in too late to share in
public money allocated to study Valley and harbor area proposals, La
Pietra paid for the study himself with part of the half-million he
says he has spent so far on the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the nine members of the Local Agency Formation Commission
have openly boosted secession and gladly speeded the application
along so that Hollywood could be on the same ballot as the Valley.
Even so, two of the nine commissioners voted against the measure and
another abstained, noting the boundary disputes and other questions
left unanswered in all the rush.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there are others who back secession, but La Pietra is
the movement's only general. He has yet to explain in detail how he,
or a new city government, would cure Hollywood's mostly
poverty-driven problems.</TE>
<TE>   Charismatic and controversial, La Pietra has borrowed the
hyperbole of the Valley secession movement, claiming that Hollywood
has suffered "100 years of neglect."</TE>
<TE>   Split between the wealth of its hillsides and its immigrant-heavy,
densely populated flats, Hollywood has highly visible problems
ranging from trash on the streets to prostitution and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But to say the area has been neglected is to ignore recent
city-backed efforts at reclamation, from the Hollywood &amp; Highland
mall, which brought the Oscars back to Hollywood this year, to the
underground Metro Red Line.</TE>
<TE>   Those who believe in one Los Angeles must persuade discontented
Valley and Hollywood residents that solutions far less drastic than
dismantling Los Angeles can work, including recent reforms such as
neighborhood councils and local planning commissions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley is this city's middle-class heart, Hollywood, from
its starred Walk of Fame to its famed sign, is the personification of
Los Angeles as city of dreams.</TE>
<TE>   These dreams belong to all of Los Angeles, not to one man who
wants to be mayor of his own city.</TE>

<LD>The jury in the Arthur Andersen criminal trial ended its fifth day of
deliberations Monday without reaching a verdict.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of nine men and three women met for about eight hours
and did not ask the judge any questions or make any requests for
additional information.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors on Sunday had asked for a dictionary, but U.S. District
Judge Melinda Harmon turned down the request, saying the panel could
ask for definitions of specific words. The jury sent no additional
notes.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors entered the jury box Monday afternoon with poker faces, and
the panel's foreman said they intended to resume their discussion
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The length of the deliberations is fueling speculation that the
panel is sharply divided, but experts say reading juries is
notoriously tricky.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor for 15 years
before entering private practice, said he believes that generally,
the longer the deliberations in a criminal trial, the more likely the
result will be an acquittal. But he said Monday that he is "not
absolutely convinced they're not just going over the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to speculate on the jury deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen faces a felony charge of obstruction of justice for
shredding Enron Corp.-related audit papers last fall after it had
learned of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry of the energy
trader. Prosecutors say the firm suddenly began directing employees
to comply with Andersen's document retention policy, which called for
the discarding of certain files, as a means of shielding Andersen
from the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said executives disposed of files in keeping with routine
business practices and lacked criminal intent.</TE>

<HD>Apple Rolls Out New Ad Campaign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apple Computer Inc. on Monday launched an advertising campaign
targeting Microsoft Corp. Windows users with testimonials from
"switchers" who abandoned Windows-powered PCs for Macintoshes.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign is Apple's largest since its "Think Different" series
launched in 1998, the firm said.</LD>
<LD>   The move also was an aggressive bid to win over what Apple--with
about 5% of the U.S. market--calls "the other 95%" of personal
computer owners who use competing systems, almost exclusively
Windows.</LD>
<TE>   Apple did not detail how much it would spend on its "Real People"
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "More people are interested in switching from PCs to Macs than
ever before, and we hope that hearing these successful switchers tell
their story will help others make the jump," said Steve Jobs, Apple's
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the ads, writer Sarah Whistler tells the camera: "I get
it. And I don't get the PC. I never did." She calls the PC a "horrid
little machine."</TE>
<TE>   Apple's market share has shown signs of stabilizing in the last
year and a half as it rolled out a series of well-received, sharply
designed computers, revamped its operating system and opened a
national chain of stores.</TE>
<TE>   That has restored some of the reputation it built in 1984 with the
original, easy-to-use Macintosh that introduced the mouse.</TE>
<TE>   Apple also has increasingly turned its focus toward winning over
PC users in addition to persuading fans to buy a new Mac.</TE>
<TE>   "Apple has had very limited success persuading Windows users to
move to the Apple platform," said analyst Charles Smulders of
technology researcher Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Apple's U.S. market share was steady at 3.8% in 2001 and 2000, and
down from 4.4% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Globally, Apple's share dropped to 2.5% in 2001 from 2.8% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Smulders attributed that contraction to relatively slow sales of
its desktop computers.</TE>

<HD>Fund Manager Convicted of Advisory Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: Alan B. Bond cheated clients out of millions in a
'cherry-picking' scheme, prosecutors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL APPLESON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Alan B. Bond, a prominent money manager who appeared regularly on the
television show "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser," was convicted
Monday of fraud for cheating pension funds out of millions of
dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The Manhattan federal jury took less than an hour to return a
guilty verdict on all six counts against Bond, 40, of Upper
Montclair, N.J., who was president and chief investment officer of
Albriond Capital Management.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand ordered that Bond be jailed
immediately because of concerns he might try to flee. Sentencing was
set for Sept. 9.</LD>
<TE>   Bond, a Dartmouth College and Harvard Business School graduate,
once held a top position in the lucrative world of money management.
Now he is  indigent and was represented by a public defender. During
the trial, he was free on bail secured by his parents' modest home in
the New York borough of Queens.</TE>
<TE>   Bond was convicted of three counts of investment advisory fraud,
which carry a maximum prison term of 10 years each, and three counts
of wire fraud, which carry a maximum term of five years each.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Gombiner, Bond's defense lawyer, said he would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Bond was arrested last year and accused of defrauding clients by
sending unprofitable securities trades to their accounts while
directing most of the profitable ones to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged that Bond's "cherry-picking" scheme ran from
March 2000 to July 2001 while he was out on bail awaiting trial on
1999 charges of taking more than $6 million in kickbacks from
brokerage firms.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to go to trial in November on the kickback
charges.</TE>
<TE>   They said Bond made $6.3 million from the cherry-picking scheme
while his clients lost more than $56 million.</TE>
<TE>   The government said that the victimized pension funds lost
two-thirds of their value, while Bond received a 5,000% return on his
own investments in a little more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense didn't really offer anything in Mr. Bond's defense,"
Tony Impieri, the jury foreman, told reporters after the verdict. "It
was pretty clear-cut."</TE>
<TE>   He said that Bond only hurt himself by testifying during the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to him taking the stand, I had reasonable doubt. The
downfall was when he took the stand.... On cross-examination, he
dodged every question; he could not give a straight answer," Impieri
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bond rose to prominence managing more than $600 million in pension
and investment funds for about 25 clients, including the National
Basketball Assn.</TE>

<HD>Patent Suit Filed by Allergan Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. said that a federal judge dismissed a
patent-infringement suit filed by Allergan Inc., clearing the way for
the eye-care company to seek approval to sell a generic version of
Allergan's Alphagan glaucoma treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Allergan sued the rival eye-care company in January,
accusing it of infringing two patents Allergan owns relating to
Alphagan.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David Carter ruled in favor of Bausch &amp; Lomb's
claim that its application with the Food and Drug Administration
didn't infringe the Allergan patents. The decision means the FDA can
continue its review of Bausch &amp; Lomb's application.</LD>
<TE>   A similar suit Allergan filed against Alcon Laboratories Inc. was
dismissed by the same judge last month, and Allergan said it's
appealing both decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Allergan shares rose 21 cents to $62.95. Bausch &amp; Lomb shares rose
$1.07 to $36.98, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Construction is underway on two apartment buildings of a
three-building complex with 122 units being developed in downtown
Santa Monica by JSM Construction.</LD>
<LD>   Located on 6th Street between Colorado Avenue and Broadway, the
two buildings will each include 48 one- and two-bedroom apartments to
be rented at market rates. A third building, still in the approval
phase, will have 26 units, said Wade Killefer of Killefer Flammang
Architects.</LD>
<LD>   The five-story Mediterranean-style buildings will include
landscaped courtyards when completed next spring.</LD>
<TE>   Hanover Financial Co. provided financing.</TE>

<HD>Instinet to Buy Rival Island ECN</HD>
<DH>Stocks: The deal is seen as an effort to stave off threat
from Nasdaq's updated trading system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instinet Group Inc., a leading electronic stock trading network
controlled by Britain's Reuters Group, has agreed to buy rival Island
ECN Inc. for about $508 million in stock.</LD>
<LD>   The two trading networks account for about 22% of the share volume
traded on Nasdaq. Their proposed union is seen as a defensive effort
to stave off the threat from Nasdaq's upgraded trading system,
SuperMontage, to be launched next month.</LD>
<LD>   Industry analysts say such consolidation is almost inevitable as
electronic brokerages fight to survive an industry slump.</LD>
<TE>   Reuters Group holds an 83% stake in Instinet. Reuters Chief
Executive Tom Glocer said Reuters this year installed new management
at Instinet and worked to cut the network's costs and increase its
market share.</TE>
<TE>   "The acquisition of Island caps this overall plan and provides
Instinet with the strongest management team in the industry," Glocer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is subject to regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet was a pioneer in the electronic brokerage business,
trading shares anonymously and often more cheaply than
long-established exchanges such as Nasdaq. The two-year decline in
stock prices has dampened investor enthusiasm and dented its
business, and many competitors such as Island have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet earned $145 million in net income last year on sales of
$1.5 billion. Privately owned Island earned a pretax profit of $40
million in 2001 on sales of $166 million.</TE>
<TE>   The two have roughly equal shares of the market as measured by
trading volume.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq's plan to introduce SuperMontage in July has added to the
pressure on Instinet. Some believe that investors might find it more
straightforward to buy and sell Nasdaq-listed shares on SuperMontage
instead of using independent platforms such as Instinet.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, Island Chairman Ed Nicoll would become Instinet's
chief executive. Instinet Chairman Andre Villeneuve would continue in
his position.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet shares rose 5 cents to $7.10 and Reuters American
depositary receipts fell 74 cents to $38.81, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Love's Lawsuit Goes to Mediation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for rocker Courtney Love and Universal Music met with a
court-appointed mediator Monday ahead of the start of the trial for
Love's breach of contract countersuit against the music giant.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for both sides were unavailable for comment late Monday,
but sources confirmed that the court-ordered meeting was underway.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Cappello, Love's attorney, previously said he had little
hope the two sides would settle their differences out of court.</LD>
<TE>   On May 30, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ordered the
mediation round and set June 11 as the trial date for Love's suit
against Geffen Records, a Universal Music label. Universal Music is a
unit of Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1999, Love decided to stop recording for Geffen. Last
year, Geffen/Universal Music sued Love, seeking millions of dollars
in damages for five undelivered albums. Love countersued last year.</TE>
<TE>   While several of Love's key claims have already been dismissed,
the case is being watched closely as a growing number of artists
challenge record companies over contract terms.</TE>
<TE>   Love and Eagles frontman Don Henley are heading a group of stars
who have been lobbying for new California legislation that would free
artists from what they say is "indentured servitude" to record
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Michael Jackson became the latest pop star to join the
artists' rights crusade, accusing his record company, Sony Corp.'s
Sony Music, of questionable accounting practices.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Mixed as Rally Fizzles</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Blue chips make modest gains, but tech shares
sink as the mood of investors remains cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's latest attempt at a rally fizzled Monday, as investors
decided they were better off collecting their small wins rather than
risking further pullbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Blue chips closed slightly higher, while technology shares
stalled.</LD>
<LD>   The market was somewhat unnerved by word that an American citizen
had been arrested for plotting to explode a radiological "dirty"
bomb. The news, which came early in the trading day, prompted a sharp
but brief sell-off. Although the market recovered, terrorism concerns
limited the market's upside.</LD>
<TE>   "All of these things have investors on the edge because they lower
the premium that investors are willing to pay for long-term assets,"
said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist at Brown Bros. Harriman &amp;
Co.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 55.73 points, or 0.6%,
at 9,645.40, despite rising as much as 128 earlier in the session.
Last week, the average fell 335 points.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators fluctuated. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index rose 3.21 points, or 0.3%, to 1,030.74, while the Nasdaq
composite index fell 4.79 points, or 0.3%, to 1,530.69. It was
Nasdaq's third-consecutive losing session.</TE>
<TE>   Rising and falling stocks were about even on the New York Stock
Exchange, while losers led by about 6 to 5 on Nasdaq. Trading volume
was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Retail was one of the few bright spots. Wal-Mart Stores advanced
$1.97 to $56.40 on word its June sales at stores open at least a year
should be at the high end of forecasts, while Kohl's rose $1.17 to
$75. The Amex index of retailing stocks rose 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have been falling for several weeks, but investors have not
rushed in to take advantage of the declines. Analysts say a mix of
lackluster earnings prospects, fears of more terror attacks and
ongoing accounting scandals have made stocks appear more risky--and
therefore less attractive--to many investors.</TE>
<TE>   Although the latest arrest of a suspected terrorist suggested the
government's anti-terrorism measures might be working, the news was
still a reminder of how many potential wild cards the market faces.</TE>
<TE>   Even an upbeat report by Goldman Sachs chief investment strategist
Abby Joseph Cohen that the Dow and S&amp;P should be trading 20% higher
than their current levels failed to inspire buying. Cohen said the
Dow should be at 11,300 and the S&amp;P 500 should be at 1,300.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more of the same. There are a lot of investigations going on
right now. And it's hard to have a lot of confidence," said Robert
Harrington, head of listed block trading at UBS Warburg. "The mood is
cautious because every time you take on more risk, you get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The dollar rose against the yen and gold prices fell $5.90 to
$318.70 an ounce due to the strengthening dollar and the easing of
tensions between India and Pakistan. Oil prices fell to their lowest
level in eight weeks, sliding 46 cents to $24.29, on expectations
Russia and Norway will boost exports.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields fell as investors initially sought the safety of
government securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
fell to 5.03% from 5.07% Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Falling oil prices were a drag on energy stocks. ChevronTexaco
fell 90 cents to $86.35 and oil field services giant Schlumberger
lost $1.10 to $48.25. Offshore service company Tidewater slid $1.64
to $36.42.</TE>
<TE>   * Williams closed down 11 cents at $8.59 after the company lowered
its 2002 forecast, but announced efforts to reduce exposure to its
energy risk management operations. Duke Energy dropped 91 cents to
$29.09 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock, citing pressure
created by a government investigation into whether energy traders
manipulated prices in California.</TE>
<TE>   * Investors snapped up drug stocks, expecting those shares have
fallen enough to reflect lower earnings forecasts, traders said.
Pfizer rose 85 cents to $35.35, and Merck added $1.62 to $54.30.</TE>
<TE>   In technology, Nokia dropped 30 cents to $12; its mid-quarter
update is expected today. Many analysts are expecting the
telecommunications company to lower its forecast. Intel fell 93 cents
to $21.07, adding to its 18.5% loss Friday after warning that
second-quarter sales and profit would be lower than expected.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Eyes Acquisitions, Expansion of Doll Centers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. is readying itself to again make acquisitions in the toy
industry, and also may expand its boutique and restaurant concept
dedicated to its popular American Girl dolls, its chief financial
officer told analysts Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Farr's comments at an analysts meeting in Hollywood came as
part of the company's efforts to focus the financial community's
attention on Mattel's robust cash flow and renewed attention to smart
investment opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Any acquisition would be a hot-button issue with Mattel investors,
who three years ago watched the El Segundo-based company's stock fall
65% as a result of the disastrous addition of software maker Learning
Co., which bled red ink from the moment Mattel paid nearly $3.6
billion for it.</LD>
<TE>   But any acquisition under Chief Executive Robert Eckert, who came
on board two years ago after former leader Jill Barad's abrupt
resignation, would be closer to Mattel's purchase of American Girl
creator Pleasant Co. than to Learning Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, when Mattel has done toy acquisitions, they've
performed well," Farr told the analysts, according to a meeting
transcript produced by the Fair Disclosures Financial Network. "It's
when we moved outside of our core competency of traditional toys that
we seem to get into trouble. In the future, if we announce an
acquisition, you can expect it to be strategic."</TE>
<TE>   Farr also said that a "top" investment possibility for Mattel is
an East or West Coast site for a new American Girl Place, an
always-at-capacity Chicago establishment centered on the
extraordinarily popular line of expensive history-based dolls.</TE>
<TE>   The dolls, books, accessories and outfits--complete with matching
outfit for the real little girls--are otherwise sold only through
catalogs and on the Web.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Summarizes Its Defense</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Microsoft Corp. on Monday laid out its defense in the
antitrust case pursued by nine states, arguing that the states are
entitled to no penalties stricter than those the company agreed to in
its settlement with the federal government last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Microsoft document, more than 500 pages, summarizes the points
the company made in two months of testimony and arguments earlier
this year.</LD>
<LD>   It is the last step before closing arguments in the case,
scheduled for June 19.</LD>
<TE>   "Today's court filing details the strong record we built during
trial and provides evidence that supports our main arguments: that
the states' remedy is unworkable, would cause great harm to the PC
ecosystem, would hurt consumers and is hopelessly vague and
ambiguous," Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   As a matter of law, Microsoft argues that the states do not have
the legal standing to demand any remedies.</TE>
<TE>   But "in the interests of maintaining uniformity," the company's
lawyers wrote, the federal settlement should be entered as an
alternative judgment.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who will decide this
case as well as the federal settlement, has not made a ruling on the
states' right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   She also has not indicated whether she will approve the federal
deal.</TE>
<TE>   States that rejected the government's settlement with Microsoft in
the fall and are pressing for tougher penalties are Iowa, Utah,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Kansas, Florida, Minnesota
and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia.</TE>

<HD>Trader Tapes Raise New Questions</HD>
<DH>Energy: Mirant and Xcel employees discussed ways to raise
profits as the state endured power shortages, a filing shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taped conversations between energy traders discussing ways to boost
profits from Western power markets in 2000 and 2001 have raised new
questions about how traders structured deals as grid operators
struggled to keep the lights on.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations, made by Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. in a
filing with federal regulators, are a further blow to an industry
trying to show it acted ethically during California's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The conversations were between traders from Atlanta-based Mirant
Corp. and Public Service Co. of Colorado, an Xcel division.</LD>
<TE>   Xcel released them last month in its response to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, which is investigating whether energy
traders practiced market-manipulation strategies discussed by Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In one conversation, on June 20, 2000, a Mirant trader told a
Public Service trader about taking power from Northern California and
moving it to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, it's just kind of loop-the-looping, but it's making
money," the Mirant trader said.</TE>
<TE>   "So what, it works," the other trader responded. "So they got to
be loving you for that."</TE>
<TE>   "It's working pretty well so far. Hopefully it keeps going," the
Mirant trader said.</TE>
<TE>   Energy trading companies typically record their traders' telephone
conversations to provide a record if a dispute arises later over a
transaction or some other issue.</TE>
<TE>   In a July conversation, traders of the two companies discussed
ways to make money on a 300-megawatt purchase by Mirant. The Mirant
trader suggested restricting the deal to 50 megawatts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to crush the market too bad," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Californians were dealing with a severe energy
shortage that had caused rolling blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Mirant executives said the traders' comments could be "easily
misinterpreted" and that all of their activity was focused on
providing Californians with sufficient electricity to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   "The scheduling to load and other market-related activities
discussed between these employees were legal, appropriate and within
the rules of the Western power market as established by FERC and the
California Independent System Operator," said Marce Fuller, Mirant's
president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   The $600-billion energy-trading business is shrinking amid
regulatory probes of sham transactions and the collapse of Enron,
once the world's biggest trader. Williams Cos. slashed its 2002
profit forecast Monday and said it plans to cut jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., said earnings will be $1.35 to
$1.70 a share this year, about 70 cents below a previous projection.
It's reducing the cash and working capital for its trading unit by a
third to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Corp., the biggest U.S. pipeline owner, trimmed its profit
forecast and cut trading jobs by half two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The shares of Williams, El Paso and power producers have tumbled
in the midst of investigations into trading practices and accounting
after the December bankruptcy filing of Enron, which inflated revenue
and hid debt.</TE>

<HD>Macerich to Buy Another Mall</HD>
<DH>Deals: The real estate investment trust, known as the 'mall
doctor,' will pay about $150 million for The Oaks shopping center in
Thousand Oaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shopping mall owner Macerich Co., which announced a $662-million
agreement to buy the largest mall operator in Phoenix last week, also
will expand its holdings in Ventura County with the purchase of The
Oaks shopping center in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica-based real estate investment trust will pay about
$150 million for the popular 1-million-square-foot Conejo Valley
property, Macerich's Chief Executive Arthur Coppola said Monday.
Macerich already owns Pacific View, the largest mall in Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   Reflecting years of consolidation in the department-store
industry, The Oaks includes a Robinsons-May at each end of the mall
(one devoted mostly to men's wear and home furnishings) along with
Macy's, a Macy's Men's &amp; Home Store and a J.C. Penney. The department
stores' parent companies own their buildings.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of The Oaks' current owners, the largest of which
is the California State Teachers Retirement System pension fund,
declined to discuss the pending sale, but Coppola confirmed that the
price is about $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich's portfolio is concentrated in California, where it owns
and operates large regional malls including Westside Pavilion, Santa
Monica Place, Lakewood Center, Los Cerritos Center and Stonewood
Center in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   The REIT has been known in shopping center circles as the "mall
doctor" for its expertise at improving the quality of tenants,
physical plants and rental revenue. Macerich completed an $89-million
expansion and improvement program at the Pacific View (formerly
Buenaventura) mall in Ventura last year, which included two new
anchoring department stores.</TE>
<TE>   The Oaks also will undergo some kind of upgrade, although the mall
is apparently performing well. The Oaks generates an average of $437
in sales per square foot, Coppola said, a rate he considers "quite
good" considering there hasn't been any substantial renovation for
many years.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich sees opportunities to increase revenue there by
consolidating either the two Robinsons-May stores or the two Macy's
into a single upscale department store, Coppola said, and officials
at the stores' parent companies have expressed interest in such a
move. That would open up a building for another department store or
perhaps provide more space for shops and specialty merchants.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich will consider improving The Oaks' roster of entertainment
tenants and restaurants, Coppola said, adding that the area's
demographics would support more upscale stores.</TE>
<TE>   Encino real estate broker Dick Carter of Centers Business
Management said improving The Oaks' strong sales figures won't be
easy, but he suggested that Macerich might consider improving
landscaping at the prototypical 1970s-era mall Carter described as
"department stores and shops surrounded by a sea of asphalt."</TE>
<TE>   The two-level mall anchors an active retail district along the
Ventura Freeway. With 130 stores and a United Artists theater
complex, the 90-acre property sits along the north side of the
freeway at Lynn Road.</TE>
<TE>   CalSTRS and minority partner Trizec Properties Inc. purchased The
Oaks in 1991, reportedly for about $94 million. CB Richard Ellis
Investors is CalSTRS' financial advisor overseeing the pension fund's
investment in The Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich shares were down 15 cents at $28.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson said an additional incident of counterfeiting
involving the Procrit anemia drug has been found, the second time in
a week the drug maker reported that some of the medicine was diluted.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter dated Friday, the company told doctors and other
health-care professionals to watch for Procrit with Lot No. P002384.</LD>
<LD>   Authentic medicine with the lot number was shipped in September,
and Johnson &amp; Johnson said it was likely that all of that Procrit was
used, so any product with the number would be suspect.</LD>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration posted Johnson &amp; Johnson's letter
about the new case on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter Thursday, the drug maker said greatly weakened Procrit
had been found in Texas and urged health-care personnel to watch for
Lot P002641.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Costa Mesa drug maker ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said its senior
management, including Chairman and Chief Executive Milan Panic,
remained in place five days after an inspector's preliminary report
had shown that three dissidents were elected to the company's board
by a 3-to-1 margin.</LD>
<LD>   Panic, the company's founder, had opposed the slate, led by
Franklin Mutual Advisers and Iridian Asset Management. Last year,
management lost three seats to a slate backed by a small European
investment group, which means non-management selections will dominate
the nine-person board.</LD>
<LD>   ICN on Monday pledged its cooperation with the board once its new
members begin their terms.</LD>
<TE>   Panic has been criticized by some shareholders for not doing
enough to boost ICN's lagging stock price. The stock is down more
than 20% since late March, just before the latest proxy fight began.
Shares gained 45 cents to close at $25.20 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Idec Halts Drug Trial; Zevalin Pay Delayed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. said that it suspended all studies of an
experimental antibody drug and that Medicare payments for its newest
cancer therapy will come later than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The news, announced after the markets closed, sent San Diego-based
Idec's shares down as much as $4.62, or 12%, to $33.75 in extended
trading, after closing up 13 cents at $38.37 on Nasdaq.</LD>
<LD>   Studies of Idec-131 were halted after at least one patient
developed a dangerous blood clot that might be linked to the drug,
the company said. Idec was developing Idec-131 for treating
psoriasis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and a dangerous blood
condition known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.</LD>
<TE>   Idec also said that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
will begin paying for Zevalin, the company's radiation-bearing cancer
drug, in October. Idec and some analysts had expected payments to
begin three months sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the delay of one quarter [before getting Medicare
payments] clearly would impact some estimates for calendar year
2002," said Chief Executive William Rastetter. "You may want to
revisit those estimates."</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration approved Zevalin in February. The
government must formulate a new set of standards for reimbursing
doctors for the drug, and some doctors have been waiting for those
standards before beginning Zevalin's use, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Libbey Drops Plan to Buy Anchor Hocking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Libbey Inc., the nation's largest glassware maker, said it would
abandon its attempt to acquire its Ohio rival Anchor Hocking for $332
million. The company attributed its decision partly to a compliance
order issued in May by the Federal Trade Commission that said the
acquisition could result in a monopoly in the tableware industry,
driving up prices.</LD>
<LD>   Libbey said it had searched for alternative solutions but
abandoned the plan because of the time it would take to implement and
the lack of certainty about FTC approval.</LD>
<LD>   Toledo-based Libbey announced in June that it would buy Anchor
Hocking, based in Lancaster, for $332 million. Anchor Hocking, the
third-largest glassware maker, is owned by Newell Rubbermaid Inc.,
based in Freeport, Ill.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Baxter International Inc., the largest maker of blood treatments,
agreed to buy the majority of Wyeth's ESI Lederle unit for about $305
million in cash to gain sales of generic injectable drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Baxter also would gain a 330,000-square-foot factory in Cherry
Hill, N.J., and about 1,000 workers, including manufacturing,
research, sales and marketing employees. Wyeth would leave the
generic drug business with the sale of the injectable medicines unit,
a spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition would add to Baxter's earnings starting in 2004,
the company said. Baxter would acquire generic injectable blood
thinners, anesthesia and psychiatric drugs that last year had $200
million in sales.</LD>
<TE>   Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter expects sales of its hemophilia
treatment, called Factor VIII, to increase more than 20% annually,
reaching $2 billion by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Madison, N.J.-based Baxter jumped $1 to $51.40 on the
NYSE.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp. will supply electricity and natural gas to Sierra
Pacific Resources Corp. for the next three months, and Sierra Pacific
will drop complaints with U.S. regulators against Duke over power
contracts in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Terms weren't disclosed. The three months cover the peak-demand
period for power use.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Pacific complained to regulators that Duke overcharged for
power last year. Duke will supply natural gas and as much as 1,000
megawatts of electricity an hour to Reno-based Sierra Pacific from
June 15 to Sept. 15, the companies said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Sierra Pacific said last month it might be forced to file for
bankruptcy protection after Nevada regulators barred one of its
utilities from collecting $437 million in power costs accrued last
year. The company filed suit to collect those costs and has been
negotiating with suppliers, such as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke, to
continue receiving electricity.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software piracy grew last year, breaking a six-year string of
progress by software companies in stamping out illegal use.
Enforcement efforts by software makers have resulted in 44
settlements with U.S. companies in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   A report by the Business Software Alliance, which includes
companies such as Microsoft Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Adobe
Systems Inc., attributes the shift to growing computer markets in
countries that traditionally have high piracy rates, such as Vietnam,
China and India. Twenty-five percent of business software programs in
the United States were pirated in 2001, a percentage point increase
from the previous year. The worldwide piracy rate jumped from 37% in
2000 to 40% in 2001, costing the industry about $11 billion.</LD>

<LD>Terra Lycos plans to jump into the subscription music business today,
offering the Rhapsody online music service from Listen.com.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials described Rhapsody--a combination of genre-based
radio and personalized Internet jukebox--as a natural evolution of
their music services, but it also responds to the subscription
services offered by Yahoo and MSN.</LD>
<LD>   Listen.com, which has licenses from four of the five major record
companies, is expected to add two of the top independents to its
roster today: Zomba Recording Corp., home of Britney Spears, and TVT
Records, whose acts include Naughty by Nature and Default.</LD>

<HD>Tyco Fires Top Lawyer as Executive Probe Was to Begin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM MCLAUGHLIN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., reeling from the indictment of the company's
former chief executive, on Monday fired its top lawyer as prosecutors
probe whether Tyco used corporate funds to enrich executives.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco abruptly fired general counsel Mark Belnick, which his lawyer
called unfair and irrational, and said would destabilize the troubled
conglomerate, whose shares surged 13% as investors overlooked credit
worries.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco said it lost confidence in Belnick's willingness and ability
to conduct a fair investigation of company executives, including the
fired lawyer. Tyco said it was determined to have a complete
investigation of any allegations of improper conduct by any of its
personnel.</LD>
<TE>   The dismissal of Belnick, who was due to collect a $10.6-million
bonus in 16 months, came as Manhattan prosecutors probe whether Tyco
used corporate funds to help executives buy pricey real estate in New
York and Florida. Tyco also hired an outside law firm last week to
conduct an independent probe.</TE>
<TE>   Worries about Tyco's debt deepened after Fitch Ratings on Monday
cut the company's debt ratings to junk status because of damaged
credibility and zig-zags in corporate strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Plaza, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said Tyco's management
and board are closely linked and changes need to be made on both
fronts to restore credibility. He said firing Belnick was not a
long-term solution to fix Tyco's problems.</TE>
<TE>   "They really need to clean house," Plaza said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares on Monday closed up $1.30 at $11.40 on the New York
Stock Exchange, after falling 54% last week.</TE>
<TE>   Belnick joined Tyco in 1998 and encountered resistance to improve
the company's corporate governance from Tyco Chairman L. Dennis
Kozlowski, who resigned last week before being indicted on charges he
conspired to avoid $1 million in sales taxes from artwork purchases,
said Stanley Arkin, Belnick's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "He had no personal relationship with Kozlowski, but he was trying
constantly to make him do what he should do," Arkin told Reuters in a
telephone interview from Palermo, Sicily. "I think [Kozlowski] was a
difficult fellow for Belnick to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "He was unhappily blindsided by his chairman," Arkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Arkin outlined an alleged turf battle that developed between
Belnick and Joshua Berman, a Tyco director since 1967, over who would
assign Tyco's lucrative outside legal work.</TE>
<TE>   Berman led the decision last week to hire the law firm of Boies,
Schiller &amp; Flexner to conduct an independent investigation, he said.
David Boies, the lawyer for former Vice President Al Gore in the
presidential election recount, and Berman worked to elbow Belnick
aside over the weekend, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco called Arkin's allegations of a turf war "ludicrous" and "an
attempt to distract attention from his client's serious problems."
Belnick will be replaced by Irving Gutin, a Tyco veteran and its
former general counsel known for his sharp negotiating skills, Tyco
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Belnick joined Tyco in 1998 after several years at the powerhouse
law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, where his
assignments included defending junk bond king Michael Milken.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco makes everything from ADT burglar alarms to plastic hangers,
which generate about $36 billion in annual revenue for a sprawling
conglomerate that is based in Bermuda, but is run from Exeter, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors are worried about how Tyco will repay $4 billion
in debt due in February.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco is betting it can sell finance arm CIT Group Inc., but some
analysts say such a sale, which could happen as late as the first
week of July, may not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of Tyco's share price this year erased about $95
billion in market capitalization.</TE>

<HD>US Airways Applies for Federal Loan Guarantee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group, the airline perhaps most damaged by the Sept. 11
attacks, said Monday that it applied for a $900-million federal loan
guarantee as part of its plan to keep the nation's sixth-largest
carrier out of bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The petition is by far the largest since the loan guarantee
program was established as part of a $15-billion bailout of the
airlines after Sept. 11. A few smaller carriers have applied so far,
and only one of those, America West Holdings Corp., has received help
in the form of a $380-million guarantee. The deadline to apply is
June 28.</LD>
<LD>   US Airways, based in Arlington, Va., was especially hard hit by
the attacks and the subsequent plunge in air travel because its
routes are concentrated in the East. The airline lost nearly $2
billion last year and an additional $269 million in this year's first
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   US Airways said it wants the guarantee to back a $1-billion loan
needed for the carrier's restructuring. The airline also is seeking
more than $1.3 billion in annual cost savings from its employees,
suppliers and lessors to help win the loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   The agency doling out the guarantees, the Air Transportation
Stabilization Board, looks more favorably on candidates that have
persuaded all those groups to make concessions to help keep the
airline flying.</TE>
<TE>   As part of that effort, the Air Line Pilots Assn.--the union for
US Airways' pilots--last week offered to cut its pay by 26%, but US
Airways is seeking a reduction of 32%, ALPA said. US Airways declined
to comment on specifics of the negotiations. US Airways' labor costs
are among the highest in the business, and the airline says cutting
those expenses is crucial to its survival.</TE>
<TE>   Built by the merger of several airlines in the 1980s, US Airways
and its regional jet units fly to 200 cities in 38 states and several
foreign countries. US Airways' stock closed Monday at $3.10 a share,
down 4 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>KCAL, KCBS News Staffs Will Merge</HD>
<DH>Television: The melding of operations by owner Viacom could
lead to newsroom staffing cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc, which owns two local TV stations, will merge the news
operations of KCAL-TV Channel 9 and KCBS-TV Channel 2 by September,
executives said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The combined news staff will be managed by News Director Nancy
Bauer Gonzales, who has been in charge of KCAL's news operation and
will produce the newscasts for both stations, said Don Corsini,
general manager of the two stations.</LD>
<LD>   No immediate changes in anchor lineups at either station are
planned, Corsini said, but the melding of staffs could lead to job
cuts in the newsroom if there is overlap.</LD>
<TE>   The merged news operation will be headquartered either at KCBS'
Hollywood studio on Sunset Boulevard, or at KCAL, which is adjacent
to Paramount Studios on Melrose Avenue, Corsini said.</TE>
<TE>   Princell Hair, who was named news director at KCBS in December,
will return to his previous position as director of news operations
for Viacom Television Stations Group.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales became KCAL news director in October after a 13-year
stint at KNBC-TV Channel 4, where she had served as assistant news
director, executive producer and news director. Her appointment is
effective immediately; she will report to Corsini.</TE>
<TE>   The merging of the two operations is the latest development in
duopoly, which is steadily growing in Los Angeles, the nation's No. 2
TV market.</TE>
<TE>   Under the duopoly concept, a company can own two stations in the
same city. Federal regulations prohibiting this concentration of
media ownership were relaxed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The KCAL-KCBS duopoly, which won approval from federal regulators
in May, is one of four locally. News Corp. owns KTTV-TV Channel 11
and KCOP-TV Channel 13. NBC recently completed its purchase of
Spanish-language network Telemundo, which means the network now owns
KNBC, KWHY-TV Channel 22 and KVEA-TV Channel 52 (though KWHY will
have to be sold because of restrictions limiting ownership to two
stations per city). Spanish-language rival Univision also controls
two stations: flagship KMEX-TV Channel 34 and KFTR-TV Channel 46.</TE>
<TE>   The era of joint ownership already has prompted previously
unheard-of practices. KCAL last month started promoting KCBS'
newscasts and news anchors. And KCOP last week moved its 10 p.m.
newscast to 11 p.m. so it wouldn't compete with KTTV's 10 p.m. news
show. In the latter case, management for the two stations said those
two news operations would remain separate.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom also owns both local all-news radio stations, KFWB-AM (980)
and KNX-AM (1070), but they too remain separate operations.</TE>

<HD>Visa, MasterCard Rebuffed by High Court in Merchants' Suit</HD>
<DH>Credit: The companies' appeal is rejected in a bid
challenging retailers' class-action status in an antitrust lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES VICINI</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal by Visa USA and
MasterCard International Inc. of a ruling that made 4 million
retailers part of an antitrust lawsuit said to be seeking as much as
$100 billion in damages from the credit card giants.</LD>
<LD>   The justices let stand a ruling by a U.S. appeals court in New
York that gave the retailers class-action status in a 1996 lawsuit
accusing Visa and MasterCard of using their power in the credit card
industry to force merchants to accept their allegedly costly debit
cards.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court rejected the appeal without any comment or
dissent, clearing the way for the case to go back to the trial judge,
U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, for more proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit, led by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest
retailer, alleged that Visa and MasterCard forced the retailers to
pay excessive transaction fees, driving up costs to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Constantine, the lead attorney representing the retailers,
said the judge probably will lay out a schedule for the trial in the
next week or two. The case had been delayed by appeals for two years.</TE>
<TE>   MasterCard general counsel Noah Hanft expressed disappointment
that the high court did not review the class certification issue.</TE>
<TE>   "By not taking this opportunity to clarify the confusing standards
for class certification that exist among district and appellate
courts today, the Supreme Court may be opening the doors to
increasing class-action abuse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Presta, a Visa vice president, said in a statement: "We are
disappointed that the Supreme Court has decided not to consider our
case at this time and, specifically, whether the case should proceed
as a class."</TE>
<TE>   He said the high court's decision on class status has no effect on
the merits of the case, adding: "As this case moves forward, we look
forward to addressing the merits and other important matters with the
court."</TE>
<TE>   In the Supreme Court appeal, Visa and MasterCard said the
retailers seek damages of about $100 billion and said the large class
could make damages so high that the defendants will be coerced into
settling, regardless of the merits of the claims.</TE>
<TE>   But the retailers derided the $100-billion figure as "fanciful"
and concocted for its "apparent shock value." They told the high
court the case involved a preliminary damages estimate of $8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The retailers said Visa and MasterCard included in their
calculation the $63 billion that the retailers would save over the
next decade if the trial judge grants a requested injunction.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart and the other retailers objected to having to accept Visa
and MasterCard debit cards, saying the cards carry higher transaction
fees than other ATM cards.</TE>
<TE>   Visa and MasterCard are owned by major banks and together control
more than 75% of U.S. credit card sales.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, upheld a federal judge's
decision allowing class certification. In contesting class status,
Visa and MasterCard said the retailer class was too large to be
manageable and the retailers used flawed economic theories in
presenting their case.</TE>
<TE>   The retailers replied that without class certification, millions
of merchants would be deprived of compensation for damages.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate decision Monday, the Supreme Court refused to let
credit-reporting firms sell lists of consumers to lenders seeking to
target the most desirable customers, turning aside a challenge to a
Federal Trade Commission order.</TE>

beefing up its electronic trading capabilities as many futures
instruments move away from boisterous open-outcry pits.</LD>
<LD>   Derivatives exchanges are under pressure to transform from
traditional open-outcry trading to computer-based systems, which
advocates say are cheaper and more efficient.</LD>
<TE>   The CME plans to roll out new technology, designed to boost
electronic trading of its flagship Eurodollar contract in the United
States as well as overseas, this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The filing with federal regulators by the CME, which offers
futures and options on interest rates, stock indexes, currencies and
commodities, marks the final stage of the exchange's tough
transition, begun several years ago, from an enterprise controlled by
members to a publicly held company.</TE>
<TE>   Futures and options provide a way for investors to protect
against--and profit from--price changes in financial instruments and
physical commodities.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the planned stock sale said the exchange may
not offer its shares to the public until the fall, to avoid
coinciding with summer holidays and the anniversary of the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The CME's parent, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc., along
with certain CME shareholders, plans to sell Class A shares in the
offering, the exchange said. The number of IPO shares and the price
range were not disclosed in the preliminary prospectus filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Although no other financial exchange in the U.S. has filed for an
IPO, several other exchanges are close behind.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq Stock Market has said that it is preparing for an IPO,
possibly as early as the fourth quarter of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1898 as a member-owned institution, the CME in November
2000 became the first U.S. financial exchange to de-mutualize,
transforming to a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation, the
first step toward an IPO.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo Tries Out Redesigned Home, Shopping Pages</HD>
<DH>Internet: Executives say new look will better serve
visitors, but analysts note it could serve advertisers as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yahoo Inc. on Monday unveiled its first major overhaul in five years
as the largest Internet portal struggles against a sluggish online
advertising market.</LD>
<LD>   Executives said changes to the site's home, mail and shopping
pages were made to better serve visitors. But analysts pointed out
that many of the modifications also better serve advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   The redesigned home page, for instance, highlights Yahoo
promotions and affiliated sites. The new shopping page places
well-known merchants higher on the page.</LD>
<TE>   "Yahoo's advertising revenue has been in free fall for the last
four to five quarters," said Derek Brown, an analyst with WR
Hambrecht &amp; Co. "Clearly the company is taking steps to address that
free fall."</TE>
<TE>   The company, launched by two Stanford University students during
the dot-com boom, has tried to make money by charging users for some
services, such as online personals.</TE>
<TE>   Most of its revenue comes from advertisements and sponsorships,
according to the company's latest annual report.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Yahoo lost $92.7 million on revenue of $717.4 million,
down from a profit of $70.7 million on revenue of $1.1 billion in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo expects to test the redesign for a few weeks and implement a
final design by July.</TE>
<TE>   The site's test home page boasts a "personal assistant," where
users can log on to their individual e-mail, calendar and address
book. The new mail page includes drop-down menus and integrates
additional applications such as a personal notepad. The redesigned
shopping page lays out products by category and merchant.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo has been working on the design for the new front page for
about six months.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall goal here ... is to continually evolve to meet
consumer needs," said Tim Brady, Yahoo's chief product officer. "It
was definitely time to update the framework."</TE>
<TE>   The portal, which has 237 million registered users, saw more than
80 million unique visitors during April, 3 million more than
Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, according to the latest numbers from Media
Metrix.</TE>
<TE>   Users can preview the beta site at www.yahoo.com/beta.html.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo shares fell 2 cents to close at $15.84 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>I've read Nat Hentoff and now Norah Vincent (Commentary, June 6) on
liberal bias in the press, and without reading the books they
reference (so many books, so little time), I'm ready to believe that
reporters who cover politicians are less repulsed by liberals than
they are by conservatives. I know I am.</LD>
<LD>   The solution is simple, of course, and that is to read widely.
Now, can anyone refer me to a bestseller about bias at the Washington
Times or Fox News?</LD>

<LD>Is it just me or does it smell bad to others when the Department of
Water and Power commission approves a $2.4-million PR contract
despite opposition from the mayor and the controller (June 5)? I
smell a hidden agenda somewhere out there. Common sense says to wait
a mere 30 days for the results of the controller's audit and then
make a more informed decision. By the way, has anybody asked
ratepayers whether they want their money going to promote this Green
LA program?</LD>

<LD>The silence is suddenly broken by the rumble of huge fire
engines--not arriving in haste, but departing slowly one by one
through an eerie moonscape tableau down the once-bucolic San
Francisquito Canyon. At the corner of my street, small children are
waving and shouting, "Thank you, thank you, guys!" A few dogs begin
to bark, a front door slams, someone calls to someone else across a
fence. Two squirrels are sparring over a tidbit of whatever in my
yard, and I can hear the blue jays voicing their approval of the
tussle. Green Valley--the evening of the day after.</LD>
<LD>   I'm taking the liberty of writing on behalf of all my neighbors in
the small southwestern corner of Green Valley--mainly Calle El Parado
and Calle Berro--two streets that emerged unscathed from the 3
1/2-day debacle that destroyed thousands of the most beautiful
Angeles National Forest acres ever seen. From Copperhill north to
Spunky Canyon, the devastation of nature's finest effort is too
expansive for the brain to comprehend. But here, on Calle El Parado
and Calle Berro, it's still a Norman Rockwell painting.</LD>
<TE>   Why were we so fortunate? Well, we had the stupendous good luck of
getting the strike team of Tim Wilson (Culver City Fire Department)
and his band of merry firefighters! I wish I had gotten all their
names, ranks, ages, etc., but what I did get was a safe home, a
neighborhood intact and a gigantic new respect for the men and women
who put their lives on the line every day fighting fires.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to each of you; a billion hugs all around!</TE>

<HD>Debate on Homeland Security: Do We Need Another Agency?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>All last week I listened to the president and senators discuss the
idea of a new Cabinet position for homeland security. I am amazed
that no one has analyzed the fact that the information about a
pending terrorist attack made its way through channels to the
president but we are not told what directives went from that meeting
back to the CIA and the FBI, or who was supposed to coordinate the
investigation to prevent the attack of 9/11.</LD>
<LD>   If a directive requesting more information from field agents
regarding a possible attack had been made, would not more information
have come to light before the attack? If so, maybe the attack would
not have been so devastating. Do we need a Cabinet-level position in
order for someone to take control of a situation? If so, we may need
a lot of new Cabinet positions in the future: homeland climate-change
security, homeland flood and wildfire security and, most important,
homeland economic security.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Now Comes Hard Part for Congress," June 7: In a brief speech
on June 6, President Bush refocused future debate regarding homeland
security.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to his speech, many congressional members saw their
responsibility as grandstanding and pontificating about how the
current administration allowed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
Those in Congress are now being forced to actually do something to
fix the problem that they themselves played a significant role in
creating.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than attempting to fault the Bush administration's actions
over the past 18 months, Congress should admit its contributions to
the problem. Examples include enactment of legislation inhibiting
intelligence agencies, reduction of intelligence funding and patent
failure in its exercise of oversight responsibilities, even as a
multitude of terrorist attacks occurred over the past 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress must now place higher priority on reallocating
committee powers for the good of the country as a whole and lower
priority on preserving their personal power for political goals. The
responsibility is theirs.</TE>

<HD>Estate Tax Repeal: to Have and Have Not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "House OKs Estate Tax's Full Repeal," June 7: The Senate is
expected to vote soon on permanent repeal of the estate tax. In my
view a repeal would be a gift to the ultra-rich, not a sensible move
to protect family businesses and farms. Family businesses and farms
would be better served by reforming, not repealing, the estate tax. A
simple and equitable reform would be to raise the exemption ceiling,
as Congress has already done. Congress raised this ceiling from
$675,000 last year to $1 million this year, and $3.5 million for a
single person, or $7 million for a married couple, by 2009. This type
of reform can keep family businesses and farms intact, yet maintain
fairness.</LD>
<LD>   An outright repeal of the estate tax would cost billions, letting
the richest Americans off the hook while increasing the burden on the
rest of us to fund vital programs. It would also put even more
pressure on state budgets here in California and elsewhere, which are
already feeling the pinch.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Greene</LD>
<TE>   Tustin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the owner of a small business, I think it's so unfair that some
members of Congress want to give multimillionaires a costly new tax
break by permanently repealing the federal estate tax, and leave the
rest of us with the short end of the stick.</TE>
<TE>   Our nation is currently struggling to provide quality education
and health care, protect Social Security and Medicare and bolster
homeland security for all. Can we really afford to give the
wealthiest 2% of estate holders an extra $850 billion over 20 years?</TE>
<TE>   Instead of helping the super-rich get richer through complete
repeal, let's permanently reform the estate tax to ensure that
small-business owners like myself, family farmers and the vast
majority of Americans never have to pay it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hollywood Tryout for Secession to Join Valley Bid on Ballot,"
June 6: Hooray for Hollywood--finally! Thanks to the visionary Gene
La Pietra, who should be praised, not vilified, for having the guts
to take on the project to save Hollywood. He is selflessly focusing
his time, money and energy on offering a new and exciting future to a
city too long neglected by L.A. City Hall. By the way, has anybody
driven through West Hollywood lately? Independence has never looked
better.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the joy of the Hollywood secessionists getting on
the ballot, did anyone mention the status of business and/or property
assessments? Will they remain at the same level or be raised? That's
a lot of "alimony" that would be due to Los Angeles that the
breakaway enthusiasts so carelessly chat about, not to mention the
ludicrous proposal of folks who want to borrow millions in "start-up"
funds. When is that planned for repayment?</TE>
<TE>   I pity the poor working stiff who not only rents business space in
the proposed city of Hollywood area but rents living quarters there,
also, and who thinks it's going to be just dandy living in the
glamour capitol of the world. He may as well be whistling "Dixie."</TE>
<TE>   Jacqueline Kerr</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What was the point of "Hollywood Would Be City of Great Extremes"
(June 9)? If it was to discredit the secession effort, it did just
the opposite by detailing problems that have only worsened under L.A.
rule. They are among the very reasons why separatists believe it
would be in Hollywood's best interests to divorce L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Of course a Hollywood city would be one of diverse cultures and
lifestyles, crime and peace, rich and poor, etc. So would a new
Valley city. So, now, is Los Angeles. On the other hand, you would
think that if both Hollywood and the Valley break away, the remaining
citizens of a much smaller Los Angeles should receive proportionally
fewer excuses and improved service from politicians and bureaucrats
who could no longer blame size for the city's struggle to keep them
safe and meet their needs. If properly done, secession could be a
win-win-win situation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Filling the Need for Speed," June 5: Please don't give these
so-called adrenaline junkies their due. I too used to ride these same
roads that these so-called motorcyclists call their home. Then, in a
blink of an eye, I was on the ground, hit head-on while riding on my
side of the road, minding my own business.</LD>
<LD>   No, I don't ride anymore, but I do have all my limbs. The kid who
hit me? He had to learn how to do everything with his left arm and
hand. And I never really felt bad about that. These people are
not--nor will they ever be--motorcyclists.</LD>

<TE>   I found your article on bikers gratifying. I want to find a way to
stop motorcyclists (and small race cars) from endangering my Santa
Monica Mountains neighborhood. I have exercised patience, reason,
admonishment, restraint--and called the California Highway Patrol to
stop the racing. It continues unabated.</TE>
<TE>   This utter disregard for oneself and others are acts of terrorism.
To react with equal violence is a shameful repetition of the world's
behavior. How do you reach this myopic behavior dictated by
narcissism?</TE>
<TE>   Sending them to another planet is appealing. I suppose the law of
eternal justice will be played out. In the meantime, I urge everyone
to practice harmlessness.</TE>

<HD>Vicente Nebrada, 72; Venezuelan Dancer and Choreographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vicente Nebrada, a renowned choreographer who directed the National
Ballet of Caracas, Venezuela, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Nebrada, who died May 26 in Caracas of leukemia, was one of the
most influential members of Venezuela's first generation of
professional ballet dancers that emerged in the 1940s and '50s.</LD>
<LD>   More than 30 companies have performed his choreography, including
Ballet Hispanico, the American Ballet Theatre, the Joffrey Ballet,
the National Ballet of Canada, the Berlin Opera Ballet, the English
National Ballet, the Australia Ballet and the Universal Ballet of
Korea.</LD>
<TE>   Nebrada was appointed artistic director of the National Ballet of
Caracas in 1984, and transformed the company's repertoire with modern
choreography that challenged conventions of classical ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Many pieces exalted his country's culture, including "Danza Para
Ti," a tribute to Venezuelan pianist and composer Teresa Carreno.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada's choreography had a strong theatrical component, whether
abstract such as "Danza Para Ti" or lyrical, such as "Inez de
Castro," about intrigue at the Portuguese court.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada required his dancers "to be very musical, and perform not
only technically, but create characters with a life of their own," as
he recently told Caracas newspaper El Nacional.</TE>
<TE>   His versions of classic ballets, including "Swan Lake," "Romeo and
Juliet," "The Nutcracker" and "Coppelia," were fundamental to his
legacy in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada began his career in 1946 at the Ballet Nena Coronil. In
1951, he was invited by Cuban ballerina Alicia Alonso to dance with
the National Ballet of Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, he went to Paris to work with Roland Petit.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada then joined the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and, in 1964,
became a principal choreographer for the Harkness Youth Ballet,
creating his first dance, "Cain," in 1967 and his first international
success, "Percussion for Six Men," in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada returned to Venezuela in 1975 and helped found the
International Ballet of Caracas with Venezuelan ballerina Zhandra
Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   The company eventually closed, but it drew international
recognition and boosted Nebrada's reputation as a choreographer.</TE>
<TE>   Nebrada lived in Caracas and New York. He is survived by his
companion, National Ballet of Caracas associate artistic director
Zane Wilson, and two sisters.</TE>

<HD>Holly Solomon, 68; Art Dealer Who Helped Transform Soho</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Holly Solomon, an actress who became a flamboyant art collector and
gallery owner and, in the process, was instrumental in transforming
New York's Soho into the international epicenter of new art in the
1970s, has died. She was 68.</LD>
<LD>   Solomon died Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan of complications from pneumonia, according to her son,
Thomas. Solomon had been in declining health for several years,
following a 1999 diagnosis of mouth and throat cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The adventurous Holly Solomon Gallery had a reputation for showing
a wide array of work, often by unknown artists, that went against the
grain of entrenched New York values.</LD>
<TE>   "Holly found a lot of young artists and gave them a chance, and I
was one of them," said L.A.-based Alexis Smith, who showed
text-and-image art with Solomon from 1975 to 1984. "She had a lot of
moxie."</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming an art dealer with her former husband, Horace
Solomon, in 1974, she was an avid art collector. She assumed the
sobriquet "the Pop Princess," which described her early enthusiasm
for the work of Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Richard Artschwager
and Roy Lichtenstein. Many artists did her portrait. (In 1995,
businessman and collector Eli Broad acquired Lichtenstein's 1965
comic-book picture of a generic, weeping blond, "I . . . I'm Sorry,"
which is actually a portrait of Solomon; Broad famously charged the
$2.5-million auction purchase on his American Express card.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Solomon opened a noncommercial exhibition space in a
scruffy downtown New York City neighborhood south of Houston Street,
a faded light-industrial manufacturing area that was beginning to see
artists arrive in search of affordable studio space. The market for
contemporary American art had recently collapsed, and venues for new
work were scarce. Solomon rented a loft at 98 Greene St.--for $158 a
month--and began to host poetry readings, performances, musical
events and exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Married to Horace, the son of a wealthy manufacturer of bobby
pins, Solomon once explained to an interviewer, "I started 98 Greene
St. because it was far enough downtown that it wouldn't upset my
in-laws."</TE>
<TE>   The 98 Greene St. Loft, with readings by poet Ted Berrigan and
performances by Laurie Anderson and Robert Kushner, operated for
three years. In 1975, the Solomons opened their first commercial Soho
space, at 392 West Broadway, in what was becoming a burgeoning area
for galleries.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon was born Hollis Dworken on Feb. 12, 1934, in Bridgeport,
Conn. Her father was a Russian immigrant who operated a small grocery
store. She went to Vassar College, but eventually transferred to
Sarah Lawrence, where her interests in acting and art developed.
After marrying, the Solomons moved to Manhattan where she enrolled in
Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio and took the stage name Hollis
Belmont. She appeared as a call girl in a feature-length independent
film, the 1969 comedy "The Plot Against Harry," but had little
success as a professional actress.</TE>
<TE>   When she opened her commercial gallery on West Broadway, Solomon
faced a good deal of skepticism, and even resistance, from those who
knew her as an Upper East Side art collector and maven. Kim
MacConnel, a painter and professor at UC San Diego who had his first
show with Solomon during her first season as a dealer and his last
show with her last year, said, "She had a certain rebelliousness that
was anti-establishment. But she put her money where her mouth was and
her legacy is profound."</TE>
<TE>   As a dealer Solomon focused on finding alternatives to the
established figures of Pop and Minimalist art. She showed figurative
New Imagepainting by Susan Rothenberg and Neil Jenney; video art by a
pioneer of the genre, Nam June Paik; and, comic videotapes and
photographs of dogs by William Wegman.</TE>
<TE>   She bought a house in suburban New Jersey so that process artist
Gordon Matta-Clark could saw it in two, creating his most famous
sculpture, "Splitting" (1974). The legendary work demonstrated that
in a nation riven by Vietnam, civil rights disturbances and the
impeachment of a sitting president, a house divided against itself in
fact cannot stand.</TE>
<TE>   The movement with which Solomon was most identified is Pattern and
Decoration art, which blossomed from the mid 1970s to the early
1980s. In addition to Kushner and MacConnel, its artists included
Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt, Valerie Jaudon, Brad Davis, Ned Smyth and
several others, and it was championed by the eloquent critic, Amy
Goldin. P&amp;D was a long-standing pejorative for Modern art, which is
precisely what interested Solomon. Issues of gender, sexuality and
non-Western cultural forms were vital to concepts of the movement,
but they were not central to established art at the time, as they are
today. Her support for Pattern and Decoration opened doors through
which many artists subsequently gained entrance to the art world.</TE>
<TE>   As the Soho scene exploded in the 1980s, Solomon moved the gallery
to 724 Fifth Ave., just off 57th Street. Her program remained the
same, but the new location was a tacit declaration that,
artistically, downtown was becoming indistinguishable from uptown.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, following her 1990 divorce, she returned to Soho
and opened a gallery at the corner of Mercer and Houston streets.
Solomon continued to show many of her now-established artists, such
as Paik, along with such younger artists as Israeli Izhar Patkin,
whose roots extend to the original Pattern and Decoration artists.</TE>
<TE>   She closed the Mercer Street gallery after losing a legal dispute
with the building's landlord three years ago. By then, most of Soho's
galleries had decamped the frenetic retail neighborhood in favor of
warehouse spaces in the Chelsea neighborhood, on Manhattan's west
side. Coming full circle, the Pop Princess opened an appointment-only
gallery at the Chelsea Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon was buried Sunday in private services in Bridgeport. She
is survived by her brother, Dr. Donald Dworken of Greenwich, Conn;
and two sons, John, an executive at Disney who lives in Glendale, and
Thomas, an art consultant and independent curator who lives in
Beverly Hills. Plans for a memorial service in New York in September
are pending.</TE>

<HD>Benjamin Ward, 75; Oversaw New York City Police</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Benjamin Ward, a street cop who broke down racial
barriers to become New York's first black police commissioner, died
Monday. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Ward was found unconscious Friday at his home and died at New York
Hospital Center. The cause of death was not immediately known, Det.
Madelyne Galindo said. He had chronic asthma, which forced his
resignation from the police department in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, who became commissioner in 1984, oversaw the nation's
largest police department at a time when crime and murder rates
spiraled upward, largely because of the crack cocaine epidemic. In
1989, the city reported more than 1,900 homicides--an increase of
nearly 40% in four years.</LD>
<TE>   It was also a period of racial unrest, marked by the shooting of
four black youths in a subway car by Bernhard Goetz, who is white;
the police shooting of an elderly black woman; and the death of a
black man chased by a white gang in the neighborhood of Howard Beach
in the New York borough of Queens.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming the city's commissioner, Ward had worked as the
first black officer in Brooklyn's 80th Precinct and had been named
the state's first black corrections commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   At the 80th Precinct, he faced resentment from both white
residents and white officers. Ward wasn't assigned a locker at the
precinct, forcing him to dress at home and ride the subway to work in
his uniform for three years.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually returned to college and earned a law degree,
sparking his rise through the department.</TE>
<TE>   When Mayor Edward I. Koch selected him as police commissioner,
Ward played down his race. "Smartness has been more important than my
blackness," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   Koch called the news of Ward's death "painful."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a marvelous person, a very good friend and a superb police
commissioner," the former mayor said Monday. "I'm proud I appointed
him."</TE>
<TE>   Ward is survived by his wife, Olivia Tucker, and their five
children.</TE>

<HD>LAX's Intricate Dance of Pedestrians and Vehicles</HD>
<DH>Chaotic, heavy traffic in the compact central terminal area
poses a danger. Still, accidents are remarkably few.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A blue sedan suddenly struck Ericka Tadeo in a crosswalk at Los
Angeles International Airport recently as she was walking to work at
Ruby's restaurant in Terminal 6.</LD>
<LD>   The impact threw her 20 feet and left her tennis shoes on the busy
lower-level roadway. Tadeo, who routinely used the crosswalk in front
of the terminal to get to and from work, remains in fair condition
after 11 days at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Vehicles traversing LAX's crowded, horseshoe-shaped roadways hit
dozens of pedestrians each year.</LD>
<TE>   It's no wonder: About 70,000 vehicles and 250,000 pedestrians
perform an intricate dance every day on the chaotic airport roads.
Half of these vehicles are shuttles, vans or buses.</TE>
<TE>   Buses and shuttles often swerve wildly in and out of
traffic--narrowly avoiding slow-moving cars and trucks whose drivers
are scanning the curb for waiting passengers. Drivers gab on cell
phones, switching lanes without notice. And pedestrians take chances,
sometimes stepping off the curb without looking.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, officials agree that the number of times vehicles get
tangled up with pedestrians at LAX is remarkably low given the heavy
daily use of the airport's compact central terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line to me is: For the number of cars and the number
of people, there just aren't that many incidents out there," said
Michael DiGirolamo, the airport's deputy director of operations.</TE>
<TE>   "That's attributable to high-profile crosswalks with warning
lights, commercial vehicle drivers knowing what they're doing, and
the general public being aware of what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Tadeo's accident is a cautionary reminder that the
world's third-busiest airport can be an unpredictable place for
drivers and pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Vehicles passing through LAX hit 30 pedestrians last year, up 25%
from a year earlier, according to the Los Angeles Police Department's
West Traffic Division, which investigates the accidents. Eight
incidents have occurred so far this year, LAPD records show.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis of the statistics highlights hot spots for vehicles
and pedestrians at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of four of the 84 accidents involving vehicles and
pedestrians at LAX in the past 3 1/2 years took place at or near busy
intersections on the facility's lower level. Most pedestrians at LAX
use this level to pick up passengers and to go to jobs at the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   The most dangerous spots are where World Way bisects East Way and
West Way on both the north and south sides of the horseshoe. Other
trouble areas are where Center Way hits World Way in front of the Tom
Bradley International Terminal and where Sky Way flows into World Way
near Terminal 1.</TE>
<TE>   World Way is the name of both the upper- and lower-level circular
roadways at LAX. East Way cuts across the central terminal area near
its eastern edge between parking structure No. 1 and the Encounter
Restaurant. West Way is a shortcut on the western side flanked by
parking structures No. 2 and No. 5 on one side and No. 3 and No. 4 on
the other.</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of the vehicle-pedestrian accidents at LAX since
1999 have been caused by drivers, according to LAPD statistics.
Drivers often failed to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks, or didn't
see them because they were traveling faster than the 25-mph speed
limit in the central terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrians, on the other hand, jaywalked, suddenly stepped off
the curb into a crosswalk or crossed against the "Don't Walk" signal
or a red light.</TE>
<TE>   Most pedestrians involved in accidents at LAX escaped serious
injury. About 66% of those struck by vehicles since 1999 have
complained of pain, while 25% or so have suffered minor cuts and
bruises. The remainder have had serious injuries, such as broken
limbs, that required hospitalization, according to an analysis of
LAPD records.</TE>
<TE>   The number of vehicle-pedestrian accidents at LAX is small
compared with similar figures for a wider swath of the city.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 821 such incidents were documented by the LAPD's West
Traffic Division last year, up slightly from a year earlier. The unit
encompasses the department's Hollywood, Pacific, West Los Angeles and
Wilshire divisions.</TE>
<TE>   LAX does have more such incidents than other major airports,
however.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco International reported three vehicle-pedestrian
accidents in 2001, down from 12 in 2000 and 13 in 1999. At
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, officials logged two such
incidents in 2001 and three in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But other airports don't have the complex layout of LAX, with its
double-deck roadway and 19 crosswalks bisecting traffic in front of
nine terminals on the lower level. San Francisco International serves
far fewer passengers than LAX, cutting down on its pedestrian
traffic. And Dallas-Fort Worth has many more passengers catching
connecting flights than LAX does, leaving it with fewer pedestrians
outside terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Many pedestrian advocates agree that airports can be confusing
places for vehicles and people. But these groups and even federal
agencies charged with tracking pedestrian safety have yet to focus on
the tricky navigation required at these facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There are definitely a lot of safety issues to be looked at at
the airport," said Deborah Murphy, founder of the advocacy group Los
Angeles Walks and head of the city's Pedestrian Advisory Committee.
"But in general, because people tend to focus more on commenting
about public streets, we're not as involved in discussions about
things like the airport."</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials offer several tips for drivers and pedestrians
who frequent LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists should pay attention to signs at the airport and
research where they're going beforehand in the Thomas Guide or on the
airport's Web site--www.lawa.org/ lax/laxframe.html--suggests Bernard
J. Wilson, the chief of airport police.</TE>
<TE>   To eliminate the need to cross the airport's busy roads,
pedestrians should take elevators to overhead walkways that extend
from each parking structure into the terminals, he said, adding that
they also should pay more attention to their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "People sometimes focus on themselves going someplace and don't
realize that they're towing luggage behind them," he said. "When they
do this, their profile gets bigger," hindering their progress in the
crosswalk or leading them to knock people off the bus aisle into
traffic.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Schools Pressured to Add 17 Days</HD>
<DH>Education: Saturday classes, double sessions are
considered to return campuses on multitrack calendars to standard 180
days of instruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District is looking at such unpleasant
possibilities as Saturday classes and running double school shifts
from morning to night to ease problems of multitrack calendars at its
most overcrowded campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 200 schools--serving almost half of the district's 736,000
students--operate year-round on staggered tracks that keep two groups
of students in session and one on vacation at any time.</LD>
<LD>   That system offers about a half hour more of classes each day, but
17 fewer days a year in a schedule that many educators believe
shortchanges academics.</LD>
<TE>   District leaders are eager to expand the school year from 163 days
to the statewide standard of 180 days at these campuses--an enormous
challenge in a system short of money and land for new construction.</TE>
<TE>   They are facing pressure for extra school days from state
legislators, as well as parents and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way to make this work, so that everybody has
180 days and everybody has an equal opportunity," said school board
member Mike Lansing. "To me, that's the real challenge."</TE>
<TE>   To build new schools and relieve overcrowding, the district says
it needs to pass an expected $3.3-billion local school construction
bond in November and receive additional funds from a $13-billion
state school bond on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   But new schools will not entirely relieve the pressures. Many
existing campuses could still face various forms of year-round
schedules even if their calendars grow to 180 days.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified officials are studying several scenarios for
extending the school year. The officials insist that the proposals
are not a scare tactic meant to sway voters to approve the bond.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, they acknowledge that the alternatives under review could
create new problems for students, parents and teachers in the
district's most crowded neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The options include:</TE>
<TE>   * Operating campuses six days a week. Under this scenario, half of
a school might attend Mondays through Wednesdays and the other half
Thursdays through Saturdays. Both groups would get shorter vacations
to ensure that the students meet the 180-day minimum.</TE>
<TE>   * Running double sessions on the same day. The school day would be
split in two, with separate teachers and administrators running
morning and afternoon shifts, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. The school year
could run up to 220 days by shortening the length of each school day.</TE>
<TE>   * Switching the three-track campuses to four tracks, which
generally rotate groups of students for 90 days of class and 30 days
of vacation repeatedly through the year. This change would extend the
calendar to 180 days, but would make it harder for students to get
Advanced Placement classes and other specialized courses that would
have to be distributed over additional tracks. The scenario also
might require increased busing, perhaps doubling the 17,000 students
who now commute from overcrowded schools.</TE>
<TE>   The various options could create new child-care dilemmas for
parents. Athletic teams and extracurricular groups also would not be
able to use gyms and playing fields that would be occupied all hours
of the day under the double-session proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the ideas have yet to be tried in California, according to
state education officials.</TE>
<TE>   Only the double session has been attempted, and only by one other
school system, the Anaheim City School District, the state officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim introduced staggered sessions four years ago to
accommodate double-digit growth while also reducing class sizes in
first and second grades.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the students in these two grades attend in the morning and
half in the afternoon at 17 of the district's 23 schools. The groups
overlap for about two hours in the middle of their school days.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim teachers complain that the schedule allows no time for
recess and only 20 minutes for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard on children. It's very hard on teachers," said
Carol Reinbolt, a teacher at Westmont Elementary and president of the
Anaheim Elementary Education Assn. "There isn't even time for a
teacher to go to the bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district passed a $111-million school bond
earlier this year, and officials plan to build more schools and phase
out the staggered, double sessions over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Anaheim envisions the end of double sessions, the Los
Angeles Board of Education is expected to consider the option and
other alternatives in August.</TE>
<TE>   School board members acknowledge the downsides to the various
scenarios for replacing the 163-day calendar. But they insist that
the solutions are less painful than the current situation.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's look at this as an opportunity to say we're not serving a
certain segment of kids the best we can," said school board member
Marlene Canter. "We'll have to make some hard decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Multitrack schools on the shortened calendar add 21 to 39 minutes
to each school day to ensure that they meet the minimum number of
annual instructional minutes required by the state. But many experts
believe that does not compensate for the lost 17 days.</TE>
<TE>   Critics point to a Los Angeles Unified study last year that showed
slightly smaller testing gains for schools on the 163-day schedule
compared with campuses on traditional calendars. District analysts
attributed most of that difference to socioeconomic factors.</TE>
<TE>   The district is facing pressure from Sacramento to abandon the
shortened multitrack schedule. Proposed legislation would require Los
Angeles Unified and a handful of other crowded districts to end the
calendar by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), a former Los
Angeles school board member who introduced the bill, called the
163-day schedule "a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   "There's no good reason to keep doing it if you are building
schools and getting space," she said. "We shouldn't have any calendar
in this state that doesn't have the minimum 180 days of instruction."</TE>
<TE>   The 163-day calendar was introduced at a single school in Los
Angeles a quarter century ago as a temporary fix for overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   Today, three-track campuses account for about one-third of the
district's regular schools and 42% of its population--310,000
students.</TE>
<TE>   While the three-track calendar allows schools to dramatically
increase their capacity, the schedule has drawn fierce criticism from
teachers, students, parents and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen lost days of class, they say, means fewer tests, less
homework and inadequate time to prepare for the Stanford 9, Advanced
Placement exams and other important tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Pedagogically, it doesn't work. I can't assign kids as much
reading as I would under a regular schedule," said John Bennett, a
history teacher at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles since
1968.</TE>
<TE>   Garfield High, one of the district's largest high schools with
more than 4,100 students, has been on the three-track calendar for
nearly 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Students say they can't get all the classes they need on their
tracks, so they sometimes have to attend school part time on their
vacations to get necessary courses.</TE>
<TE>   The daily schedule itself presents another problem. Teachers and
students, who begin class at 7:25 a.m. and end at 3:11 p.m., say the
schedule burns them out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to concentrate on AP calculus at all. It's especially
hard at 7:25 in the morning," said senior Daniel Santos, who also is
cross-tracking to get two AP classes.</TE>
<TE>   "I would personally like it if they would get rid of the track
system. I think it's a really bad idea."</TE>

<CX>   School schedule--A California section story Tuesday about proposals
to lengthen the school year at multitrack campuses in Los Angeles
incorrectly stated that Garfield High School has been on a
three-track, year-round calendar for nearly 20 years. The East Los

<HD>A Ringside Seat for Solar Eclipse</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: People flock to Griffith Observatory to watch
the phenomenon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crowd outside Griffith Observatory brightened as the sun dimmed
Monday for the last solar eclipse that Los Angeles will experience
for 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   "Repent! The end is near!" Terry Lilly, a 40-year-old Hollywood
photographer, shouted as the moon moved between the Earth and the
sun, blocking nearly 75% of the sun's light.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomy fans on the observatory steps banged pots and pans at
6:22 p.m., the moment of maximum eclipse, "to ward off evil spirits,"
observatory Director Ed Krupp joked.</LD>
<TE>   But mostly the estimated 1,200 sky watchers were trying to ward
off damage to their eyes from staring at the last solar eclipse
visible in the United States until 2005. The next one that will
darken Los Angeles skies will come in 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Solar viewers ranged from ordinary to ornate. Lizette Villa, 10,
of Atwater Village made hers from two 3-by-5 recipe cards--one with a
pinhole poked in it. Next to her, Luis Ashelford, a Lawndale
technical writer, focused a $15,000 brass telescope, an antique built
in 1899.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Monterey Bay students Oleya Pearsal and James Boydston
shared a $7 Solarama filter purchased for the eclipse. Observatory
workers sold more than 700 of them Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Boydston, who is majoring in world culture, said solar eclipses
regularly scared those living in medieval Europe. "I don't know if
anybody still feels that way today. I'm still pretty early in my
studies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Bache, a movie special effects technician from Sherman Oaks,
used a welder's mask from work to protect his eyes. Manhattan Beach
software systems manager Matthew Reiser fashioned a viewing screen
from a mirror and a piece of cardboard. "I got the idea from the
nasa.gov Web site," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Seidel, a stockbroker from Beverly Hills, held up a sheet of
exposed X-ray film from a doctor's office to protect her eyes while a
few steps away Jose Quinonez, a video editor from Burbank, peeked
upward through a pane of window glass he had darkened with a candle.</TE>
<TE>   "Humans can't duplicate the majesty of a solar eclipse. All of the
amusement parks in the world can't compare," Charles Glasscock, a
technical writer from San Fernando, said as he aimed his binoculars
toward the sun and projected its image on a piece of paper for his
14-year-old son, Chris.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, those at what should have been the West's best eclipse
viewing site, San Diego, didn't have to rely on eye-safety devices.</TE>
<TE>   Clouds rolled in at 6 p.m. to provide a natural viewing filter for
100 people who gathered outside the Ruben H. Fleet Science Center.</TE>
<TE>   Science center officials had ordered 5,000 pairs of solar viewers
to sell on Monday. At $1 each, they were sold out by 1:20 p.m. "We're
going to order 10,000 viewers for the next eclipse in 2012," said
Cindy Pittman, spokesman for the center.</TE>
<TE>   Visitor Mattias Pettersson, 33, of Sweden, was looking for a
far-out solar experience. "I'm hoping for that scary moment when it
gets real dark and everyone starts running around in circles
screaming and crying," he joked.</TE>

<LD>In his first television ad attacking his Republican challenger, Gov.
Gray Davis on Monday accused Bill Simon Jr. of mismanaging a savings
and loan at a cost of millions of dollars to taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   The spot seeks to raise doubts about Simon's job qualifications
before the little-known GOP nominee introduces himself to voters on
his own terms.</LD>
<LD>   "Bill Simon: If he can't run an S&amp;L, how can he run California?" a
narrator asks.</LD>
<TE>   The ad refers to Western Federal Savings and Loan, a Marina del
Rey thrift seized by the government in 1993. Simon was on its board
of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday evening, after a conference call with his advisors,
Simon told reporters that the governor had launched the negative ad
to distract from his own shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not responsible for the failure of the savings and loan,"
he said. "A board member does not run a company, as is well known.
It's just a shame that Davis has to stoop to inaccuracies or worse."</TE>
<TE>   The 30-second spot launches a season of attacks and counterattacks
in television ads that will cost the Davis and Simon campaigns tens
of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Since Simon's surprise victory three months ago in the GOP
primary, he and the Democratic incumbent have sparred mostly in
newspaper headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Davis started running TV ads touting his record on crime and other
issues last week, but Simon, who is millions of dollars behind the
governor in fund-raising, has not gone on the air.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;L spot builds on the negative image of Simon that the
governor has tried to project for weeks by having campaign aides
label him "rich-kid Billy Simon."</TE>
<TE>   The spot says Simon "inherited a fortune" and directed an S&amp;L that
"made bad loans, went belly up and was seized by the government."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's "mismanagement" cost taxpayers $90 million, it says, and
now he "is suing the government, asking taxpayers to pay him back his
investment."</TE>
<TE>   "He's out there every day accusing the governor of gross
mismanagement," said Davis strategist Garry South. "We think it was
high time that he had to answer for some of his own mismanagement in
the private sector."</TE>
<TE>   Simon faced a similar attack in the primary from GOP rival Richard
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   The former Los Angeles mayor ran an ad saying that Simon "cost
taxpayers $92 million in a failed savings and loan."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has denied that he mismanaged Western Federal. As a board
member, he contended, his role was to monitor his family's
$40-million investment in the thrift.</TE>
<TE>   The Simons and their partners allege in a lawsuit that the
government improperly seized Western Federal. The suit says the
government caused the thrift's collapse by reneging on its agreement
to relax minimum capital standards for the S&amp;L.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ad questions Simon's integrity at a time when the
governor is mired in a state software contracting scandal. Davis also
has faced bad publicity over his aggressive solicitation of campaign
money.</TE>
<TE>   In public remarks about Simon, Davis has focused mainly on
ideology, using his rival's opposition to abortion rights, for
instance, to cast him as more conservative than most Californians.</TE>
<TE>   To reach beyond his conservative base, Simon has begun emphasizing
environmental issues.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara on Monday, he promoted his plan to phase out
offshore oil drilling. In Los Angeles, he called for a $1-billion
bond issue to expand California's parks.</TE>
<TE>   GOP strategist Arnold Steinberg said it was noteworthy that Davis'
first ad against Simon steered clear of abortion, which voters might
view as a diversion from state budget troubles. The S&amp;L ad poses "a
key test of the crisis management of the Simon campaign to see how
well they respond," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "S&amp;L is a buzzword for people losing money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon strategist Jeff Flint said that Simon would go on the air
"as soon as we think it's necessary," but that the Davis ad "could
accelerate our schedule."</TE>
<TE>   With relatively scarce campaign funds, Simon risks running out of
money if he advertises too soon. The November election is nearly five
months away.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is a multimillionaire who could tap his own fortune (his
family put $5.5 million into the primary), but donations could dry up
if he gives the impression that he could get by without them.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;L spot will run in the same Central Valley and Los Angeles
media markets where Davis last week began running the ads promoting
his record.</TE>

<HD>FBI Seeks Records on Scuba Training</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Agency believes terrorists want to develop an
underwater attack capability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exercising "an abundance of caution," the FBI says it is scrutinizing
scuba shops around the country based on information that "various
terrorist elements have sought to develop an offensive scuba diver
capability."</LD>
<LD>   The three largest organizations that certify divers have turned
over millions of names of students who passed scuba courses in the
last three years. The FBI is checking those names against its files
for potential terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, agents are fanning out to the nation's estimated 1,200
scuba shops to inquire about people who enrolled in diving classes
but withdrew before their names could be added to a list of certified
divers.</LD>
<TE>   They want to know of anyone who asks strange questions or shows a
sudden and unusual interest in an underwater apparatus called a
re-breather, which permits diving without telltale bubbles, or other
high-tech gear used by Navy frogmen.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for people who are diving where they shouldn't be
diving, or making unusual purchases," said John A. Sylvester,
counterterrorism squad supervisor in the FBI's San Diego office.
"We've been checking with all scuba-certified instructors."</TE>
<TE>   All this scrutiny of dive schools--similar to what flight schools
have faced since Sept. 11--is making some dive instructors and shop
owners uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Kurtis, co-owner of Reef Seekers Dive Co. in Beverly Hills,
called the demand for wholesale lists of students "reprehensible and
unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing if they came in and asked, 'Do you know something
about these individuals?' " Kurtis said. "It's another thing to say,
'Give me everything you've got on everybody who you taught to dive or
bought something in your store.'</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fishing exhibition. It's totalitarianism, and it's
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Even some FBI agents consider it farfetched to think that
terrorists could mount a significant attack from underwater.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to what is possible on land, it is far more difficult to
make or buy a device that will explode underwater. Transporting
explosives underwater is even more difficult, given that a diver--or
a team of divers--can haul only a small amount for a short distance.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Navy Seals train for years to master underwater demolition.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that the devastating attack on the Navy destroyer
Cole in Yemen could not have been carried out underwater. It took a
boat to haul enough explosives to cause the extensive damage.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a year ago, it would have sounded farfetched to think a
group could fly planes into buildings, turning passenger airlines
into bombs, Sylvester said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Al Qaeda has taken years to plan operations. It's not beyond
the realm of possibility for them to think of this type of attack,"
Sylvester said. "Obviously San Diego and Los Angeles and other
coastal cities have viable water targets, ranging from commercial
tankers to Navy ships."</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI, the scuba warning came out before Memorial
Day from information gleaned from detainees held at the Navy base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   "While there is no evidence of operational planning to utilize
scuba divers to carry out attacks within the United States, there is
a body of information showing a desire to obtain such credibility,"
the warning stated.</TE>
<TE>   So far, said FBI spokesman Bill Carter, "the information in this
case is unconfirmed and uncorroborated. But we must assess every
potential treat, out of an abundance of caution."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Nadler, a vice president of the Professional Assn. of Dive
Instructors, said agents began to enter some of its 1,000 affiliated
dive stores right before the Memorial Day weekend demanding all
records of past students.</TE>
<TE>   "We know of one dive store that told the agent they were too
busy," Nadler said. "The agent returned with a subpoena."</TE>
<TE>   So the Professional Assn. of Dive Instructors, the nation's
largest dive certification organization, decided to furnish the FBI
with computerized records of 2 million students--with some
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned about privacy issues," Nadler said. "We wanted
some assurances, which they agreed to, that this was proprietary
information not to be used for any other purpose than investigation
into potential terrorism. And they would return us the list when they
were done."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bram, president of the National Assn. of Underwater
Instructors, said his nonprofit group also supplied the FBI with the
names of students from the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   So did Scuba Schools International, another dive certification
group. These three groups certify about 98% of all U.S. divers.</TE>

<HD>10 Groups Join the Battle Over Secession</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: More are expected to emerge on both sides of the
issue as the campaign heats up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten groups and counting are gearing up separate campaigns for and
against the breakup of Los Angeles, a battle that will be fought over
the airwaves, through the mail, in neighborhoods and on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The political, business, labor and homeowner organizations facing
off in the Nov. 5 secession election plan to spend a combined $10
million on media ads, voter registration drives, and precinct-walking
operations focused mostly on the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood,
the breakaway regions where the fighting is likely to be fiercest.</LD>
<LD>   Allied against secession are some of Los Angeles' leading
political figures, their richest benefactors and the city's powerful
labor movement.</LD>
<TE>   The unions representing Los Angeles police officers and service
workers are expected to play a big role in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, former mayor Richard Riordan and former
mayoral candidate Antonio Villaraigosa have set aside their longtime
differences to work together against secession.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's L.A. United plans to raise $5 million for a campaign that
will rely heavily on television and radio spots.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, Valley secessionists are assembling a
grass-roots network that they hope will ignite populist sentiments
like those captured by Proposition 13 in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   They concede that they will have less money than their opponents,
but are counting on enthusiasm to make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   And in Hollywood, secession backers say they intend to rely on
volunteers and about $1 million in contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-secession efforts also could receive a jolt in coming
weeks as dozens of candidates for offices in the proposed cities
begin lining up their campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Each candidate will be, at least implicitly, stumping for the
breakup that would create those offices, in effect expanding the
range of pro-secession campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, the efforts on both sides will identify the basic
service arguments--the benefits of small government versus the
economies of scale that Los Angeles claims to provide: lower taxes,
faster police response time, cheap water. But many of the groups are
prepared to play rough.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, say its supporters, is the ticket out of a floundering
metropolis, a crime-ridden and polluted city whose schools are
failing its children. Critics counter that secession does little to
address those problems--schools, for instance, would be unaffected by
municipal breakup--and that breaking the city into pieces will set
both the new cities and the old on a perilous course into the
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign Expands</TE>
<TE>   The number of groups launching campaigns seems to grow by the day.
The League of Women Voters, citing the feared cost of a breakup,
announced over the weekend that it will oppose secession. A
loose-knit coalition of Westchester activists said Monday it will
support secession because the area's City Council member, Ruth
Galanter, is due to be shifted to the Valley as part of
redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   Some politicians say the various organizations need to coordinate
their messages so that voters will not become confused or alienated.</TE>
<TE>   "There better be some coordination, or it's going to be a circus,"
warned City Councilman Dennis Zine.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood and Valley secessionists say they are addressing the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders of their organizations have joined forces and are now
sharing a political consulting firm, Goddard Claussen Porter and
Novelli.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, a strategist for Hahn, said many anti-secession
campaigns also are pulling together. Some secession opponents,
however, say privately they plan independent efforts and want little
to do with the mayor's push.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he was relieved that a state panel held a harbor
secession proposal off the Nov. 5 ballot, meaning his campaign will
be less complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I think if you have to fight a battle on three fronts
that makes it more difficult," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   But there remains the challenge of reaching diverse audiences of
voters--from impassioned pro-secession residents in the breakaway
areas to people in other parts of the city who have yet to pay much
attention to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Valley and Hollywood secession groups hope to spend $2.5 million
to $5 million. The secessionists say they will make up for any
spending gap with their opponents by enlisting armies of volunteers
to knock on doors, stuff envelopes and reach out to voters over the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Schubert, a consultant for the secessionists, said the
campaign will probably use a Web tactic that worked in 1998 when his
firm helped win passage of a statewide school bond measure.
Volunteers downloaded all the printed material from a Web site, then
distributed it neighborhood by neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Our material was all over the place," Schubert said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley Independence Committee, which claims to
have 2,000 volunteers, will head the leading pro-secession campaign.
Its strategy is to capture 65% of the vote in the Valley, which could
carry the vote citywide because of traditionally lower turnout south
of Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   To win, each secession proposal must be approved by a majority of
voters in the breakaway area and a majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   The City of Hollywood Foundation is the tentative name for the
pro-secession group there. It has 200 volunteers so far, said
organizer Fares Wehbe. The group also is counting on lopsided support
in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Facing Opposition</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists face a growing array of opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, two small groups of activists--Hollywood and Los Angeles
as One and Divide We Fall--announced that they will fight secession
separately from Hahn's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, the group One L.A. was formed by Valley civic
leaders. It also plans an independent campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a bigger effort is being plotted by the Los
Angeles County Federation of Labor, which has hired political
consultant Parke Skelton to plan mail and phone banking to the
200,000 union members in Los Angeles. Forty percent of the members
are in the Valley, Skelton said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Service Employees International Union, Local 347,
which represents most blue-collar city employees, has already set up
a phone bank to target its 8,000 members in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The directors of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the
union representing officers, are expected to vote as early as
Wednesday to oppose secession. It is already crafting a campaign, as
is the United Firefighters of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The two unions are concerned that their members' jobs could be in
jeopardy if secession wins and the Valley and Hollywood eventually
contract with Los Angeles County for police and fire services.</TE>
<TE>   The unions say they will warn voters that public safety may suffer
if that happens.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, political party organizations are also readying
campaigns. The Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley opposes
secession. The chairman of the Los Angeles County Democratic Central
Committee said Monday that the panel is likely to vote tonight to
oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Eric Bauman said such a vote would free up money and
volunteers, including from the state party, to fight a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 60% of the city's 1.45 million registered voters are
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Media ads for both sides will likely begin in September, a month
earlier than normal, according to Bill Carrick, a political
strategist working on the Hahn effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest is there much earlier, and [it's] more intense,"
Carrick said.</TE>
<TE>   He said focus groups conducted by Hahn's campaign indicate 75% of
the electorate is "movable" on secession.</TE>
<TE>   "This is up for grabs," Carrick added.</TE>

<HD>Murder-Suicide Claims 3 in Family</HD>
<DH>Crime: Father is called culprit in Lake Forest. Toddler is
stable after being shot in the chest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON, MAI TRAN and MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lake Forest man described as a devout churchgoer shot and killed
his wife and 15-year-old nephew as they prepared for work and school
Monday, then fired a bullet into the chest of his toddler daughter
before fatally shooting himself, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent murder-suicide happened between 7 and 8 a.m. in Cedar
Glen, a complex of wood-frame apartments on Trabuco Road. The
shootings shocked friends and relatives of the deceased, who
described them as a typical, loving family. But authorities said
there were marriage strains and that the couple were talking about
splitting up.</LD>
<LD>   Police identified the shooter as Thomas Lewis Turner, 39, an
employee of Cal-Cen Federal Credit Union in Anaheim. The bodies of
Thomas Turner and his wife, Acedra Renee Turner, 39, were discovered
in one bedroom of their two-story apartment. A small-caliber handgun
lay at the husband's side. Their nephew Broderick Turner, a popular
freshman football player at El Toro High School who had lived with
the family, was found in another bedroom.</LD>
<TE>   Police did not release the name of the Turners' 22-month-old
daughter, who was shot in the chest as she lay in her crib. The
toddler was listed in stable condition at Mission Hospital Regional
Medical Center in Mission Viejo after surgery Monday afternoon.
Authorities said the bullet apparently tore through the girl's chest,
missing major organs.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were alerted to the shooting when Acedra Turner's
mother tried to call her at work Monday morning. When Freddie Kessee
failed to reach her daughter at EME Fan and Motor in Brea, she grew
concerned. When she failed to reach her son-in-law as well and
learned from Broderick's school that the boy, who rarely missed
school, was absent, she called police.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County sheriff's deputies arrived about 10 a.m. to find the
apartment's blinds drawn and the front door bolted, sheriff's
spokesman Jim Amormino said. Deputies borrowed a ladder from a
neighbor to look through the apartment's second-story window and,
through a gap in the blinds, saw the wounded child in the crib.
Deputies then broke through the front door.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors began to learn of the shooting as they heard Kessee
screaming into her cell phone in front of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "The screams were just echoing," said neighbor Monique Acero, 30.
"She was yelling, 'He killed her! They're all dead! All of them are
dead!' "</TE>
<TE>   The couple had been married about four years and were often seen
barbecuing by the apartment's pool or leaving for services at St.
James Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Ana, according to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Van D. Roberson, pastor of the nearby Greater Light Baptist Church
and also a member of St. James church, said he had known the Turners
for about 10 years. Thomas Turner was a trustee at the Santa Ana
church, he said, and Acedra Turner was an usher.</TE>
<TE>   "She was sweet as pie," Roberson said. "She was mannered,
responsible and so shy. When you'd try to hug her, she'd just smile
and turn away."</TE>
<TE>   The family attended church together Sunday, and other members said
they saw nothing amiss.</TE>
<TE>   "They were outgoing and friendly as usual," said Linda McLeod of
Santa Ana, who has attended St. James for 21 years. "But you never
know what a person is holding within."</TE>
<TE>   The couple always appeared devoted to each other at Sunday
services as well as periodic church picnics and fund-raisers, McLeod
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you saw them, they were always doing something helpful
for those in need," she said. "Like if a child said they wanted a
particular kind of toy but their parents couldn't buy it, the Turners
would make sure the child had it the next week."</TE>
<TE>   Yet one neighbor described ominous sounds from the Turners' home.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Troupe, 35, said she sometimes heard Acedra Turner screaming
from the apartment before dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "She'd wake me up in the middle of the night," Troupe said. "She
screamed like she was being hurt. The woman would be hysterically
screaming her head off.... Sometimes I could hear her scream, 'Stop
it!' "</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's spokesman Amormino said there was no record of domestic
disturbances at the Turners' address.</TE>
<TE>   News of Broderick Turner's death sent shock waves through El Toro
High School. Although students were not told immediately of the boy's
death, teachers were. One of them was so stunned by the news that she
had to leave, Principal Jack Clement said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just in shock," Clement said. "He was a pleasant kid to be
around, just delightful."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Monday evening that Thomas Turner had a
17-year-old son from a previous relationship, but the youth didn't
live with him. Police said Broderick Turner had been adopted by
Thomas Turner's mother.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital late Monday, relatives held vigil outside the room
of the 22-month-old girl. A court will ultimately decide who will get
custody of the child, Sheriff's Sgt. Christine Murray said. She said
custody may go to the grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives found it difficult to speak of the family.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just continuing to pray at this moment. There was no
warning that this was going to happen," said James Kessee, brother of
the slain wife. "Let's just say she was a very loving mother."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting happened just hours after a large family
get-together: Relatives said they last saw the family Sunday evening,
when they all convened to enjoy a dinner out.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a wonderful person. I don't understand it," said Thomas
Turner's sister, Denise Johnson. "It's a shock because we saw him
last night. We all went out to dinner. He was in good spirits. He
called my mother before she went to work and he sounded fine. And we
just got the call this morning, and that was it."</TE>

<LD>Union leaders protested Monday that the Los Angeles Unified School
District has not dedicated funds for increases in salaries or medical
benefits for teachers, clerical workers and other employees.</LD>
<LD>   Day Higuchi, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the
district had spent too much money paying top administrators and
buying real estate.</LD>
<LD>   UTLA is seeking a 5% raise for its teachers.</LD>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer and other district leaders have said that there is
no money for teacher raises this year because of state budget cuts,
rising costs of special education, disability payouts and legal
costs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Backing away from what appeared to be a losing battle, Los Angeles
City Councilman Nick Pacheco said Monday that he no longer seeks to
take parts of Councilwoman Jan Perry's downtown district.</LD>
<LD>   Pacheco's decision came on the eve of a council vote to redraw the
city's 15 districts to reflect population changes in Census 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The councilman said he did not want to pursue a fight that might
be used as campaign fodder by secessionists.</LD>
<TE>   For months, Pacheco--who represents parts of Eagle Rock and Boyle
Heights--had sought to expand his district into the city's core,
taking over City Hall and surrounding areas. Perry, however, launched
a battle to keep her district intact.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is set to vote on the new map today.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Trial for South Gate Treasurer</HD>
<DH>Court: Ruling comes after an investigator describes threats
Albert Robles allegedly made against two lawmakers and a police
lieutenant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Monday ordered South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles to stand
trial after a district attorney's investigator detailed several
alleged incidents in which the politician unleashed vulgarity-laced
threats against other public officials.</LD>
<LD>   The investigator, Michael Kim, said Robles uttered threats to
people close to his alleged victims, and that they were relayed
within a few days.</LD>
<LD>   Robles allegedly threatened to rape Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) and shoot Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) in
the head, Kim testified.</LD>
<TE>   Escutia was so fearful that she arranged for bodyguards and
notified the Legislature's security team, said Kim. He said another
alleged victim, South Gate Police Lt. Vince Avila, started carrying
his gun at all hours.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged threat against Avila was relayed to him by a former
girlfriend of Robles, Kim said. The girlfriend, he said, told him
that Robles considered Avila a "loser" and that "losers deserve to
die like a dog."</TE>
<TE>   "The proper way to kill someone is to shoot them in both eyes,"
Robles allegedly told the girlfriend. Robles "told her to make sure
she delivers that message to Lt. Avila," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim was the only witness in the hourlong preliminary hearing in
South Gate Superior Court. After a brief cross-examination in which a
defense attorney mostly quizzed Kim about his interviewing methods,
Judge Dennis A. Aichroth ordered Robles to stand trial on nine felony
counts.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the charges relate to Robles' alleged threats. He is also
charged with owning two illegal, assault-style weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, wearing a black business suit, showed no reaction during
the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   He remains free on $500,000 bail and will continue his duties as
treasurer and deputy city manager. Robles was appointed to the latter
position, at a salary of $111,000, after his arrest in a move that
sparked civic protests.</TE>
<TE>   Robles was a lightning rod for controversy long before the threats
case. The city's perceived political boss, he has been dogged for
years by accusations of corruption and self-dealing. The city is also
facing several corruption investigations, some of which target Robles
or his allies.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing Robles expressed confidence that he would be
exonerated of the threat charges. He criticized Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley for pursuing what he calls a politically motivated case.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has claimed that he is being prosecuted in retaliation for
his political battles with the state legislators. They took opposite
sides on a controversial proposal to build a power plant in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a witch hunt meant to destroy my political career," said
Robles. "It doesn't matter what Steve Cooley thinks. It's what a jury
thinks."</TE>
<TE>   Kim testified that several witnesses heard the alleged threats.
One was Francisco Leal, a friend of Firebaugh and a longtime attorney
who has worked for several cities in southeast Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   While sitting next to Robles on a flight from San Jose to Los
Angeles, Leal said, Robles grew agitated when Firebaugh came up.
Leal, according to Kim, said he will never forget what Robles said
next.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to just take [Firebaugh] out to Tijuana, put him in the
trunk of a car and blow his ... brains out," Robles allegedly told
Leal.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged threats against Escutia were made at a lunch meeting
at a Compton casino, where Robles was meeting with a businessman and
a Lynwood politician, Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   The businessman allegedly heard Robles say that, if he could get
away with it, he would rape Escutia and kill her husband, Leo
Briones. The businessman said Robles repeated the threat several
times in a loud, angry voice.</TE>
<TE>   Upon hearing of the alleged threat, Escutia took it seriously, Kim
said. Like other alleged victims, he said, Escutia cited Robles'
volatile temper, and believed he may have been involved in the 1999
shooting of then-South Gate Mayor Henry Gonzalez. Gonzalez suffered a
minor head wound in the crime that has never been solved.</TE>
<TE>   Like Escutia, Avila took precautions against the alleged threats.
The lieutenant, Kim said, was warned by Robles' former girlfriend
that he should watch his back because she thought Robles was out to
get him.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kim, the woman said Robles liked to brag that his
brother was a former Mexican Mafia member who was willing to kill for
him.</TE>
<TE>   "She said [Robles] has lots of guns and that ... he's crazy," said
Kim.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Gets Jail Term for Abusing Boys at School</HD>
<DH>Scandal: A separate suit says the archdiocese had gotten
complaints about the math instructor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Catholic school math teacher was sentenced to a year in county jail
Monday for sexually abusing children.</LD>
<LD>   Armando Garcia, 42, pleaded guilty late last month to
inappropriately touching six boys and engaging in oral copulation
with a seventh.</LD>
<LD>   The incidents occurred at St. Lawrence Brindisi School in Los
Angeles from 1997 through 2000, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Katz said.
The victims were 12- and 14-year-old students.</LD>
<TE>   The school is run by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education and
Welfare Corp., which is accused in a separate lawsuit of not acting
quickly enough to stop Garcia, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for the archdiocese, expressed sympathy
for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a terrible, terrible breach of trust," he said. "The vast
majority of our teachers are very good people who hold the trust that
the parents place in them as sacred."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to imposing the jail sentence on Garcia, Judge David
M. Horwitz put him on probation for five years, and ordered him to
register as a sex offender and to get psychological counseling.
Garcia will begin serving his jail sentence in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said Garcia was arrested after one student reported him to a
school administrator, who in turn reported the teacher to police.</TE>
<TE>   He said Garcia could have received up to life in prison if he had
been convicted in trial on all counts because multiple victims were
involved. A trial would have been risky, he said, because many of the
victims "were extremely uncomfortable" about going to trial, and some
were uncooperative.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what would have happened ... if we had pursued the
case to trial," Katz said. "Certainly, evidentiary concerns weighed
heavily in the decision."</TE>
<TE>   A relative of one victim, who asked not to be identified by name,
said she understood the prosecution's decision to accept a one-year
sentence. Other families didn't want to get involved, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she said Garcia deserved more time.</TE>
<TE>   "He abused them physically and psychologically," she said in
court. "He's a threat to society."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the courtroom with his lawyer, Garcia did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   A 15-year-old youth filed the civil complaint on May 10 alleging
Garcia molested him during the 1999-2000 year in and outside of
school when he was 14 and in the seventh grade.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that the student, identified as John Doe,
suffered emotional distress, including nightmares, depression and
embarrassment. The distress could last into adulthood and "adversely
affect his relationships and self-concept," according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses the Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education and
Welfare Corp. of negligently hiring and supervising Garcia and
alleges it should have known he could not be trusted around children.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese received complaints about inappropriate behavior
with students and had reason to be suspicious of him, according to
the lawsuit. It says Garcia almost always selected boys for his
special math competition group.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that Garcia put children on his lap during
class, and posted a picture on the wall showing him and a boy "in an
inappropriate embrace."</TE>

<LD>JERUSALEM -- Israel's first astronaut, who lost relatives to Nazi
death camps, will blast into orbit with a picture of the moon drawn
by a Jewish child killed in World War II, the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial here announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ilan Ramon, a colonel in the Israeli air force, will be launched
July 19 aboard the space shuttle Columbia, taking with him "Moon
Landscape," a drawing by 14-year-old Peter Ginz, who died in the
Auschwitz death camp.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel that my journey fulfills the dream of Peter Ginz 58 years
on--a dream that is ultimate proof of the greatness of the soul of a
boy imprisoned within the ghetto walls," a Yad Vashem statement
quoted Ramon as saying in Houston, where he is training.</LD>
<TE>   "Ginz's drawings, stored at Yad Vashem, are a testimony to the
triumph of the spirit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon, a payload specialist, is due to take part in a 16-day
mission to conduct scientific research. His grandfather and other
family members died in concentration camps.</TE>

scores injured, and cars and shop windows damaged throughout much of
Moscow's center.</LD>

Russia's 1-0 loss to Japan. Russian media said one of the victims was
a police officer who died from knife wounds.</LD>

<HD>A Faith Near to Heaven</HD>
<DH>A century and a half ago, French priests brought
Catholicism to the Tibetan plateau. There it has endured, despite
war, Maoism and rival religions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CIZHONG, China</DL>
<LD>They arrive on foot each Sunday, some walking as long as an hour.
They come through the doorway in silence, then kneel, heads bowed,
hands folded.</LD>
<LD>   Their prayers to Jesus echo off the cold stone walls; pictures of
the Blessed Virgin gaze down from the church's pillars; the altar
shimmers in the candlelight.</LD>
<LD>   It's a tableau of piety and reverence familiar around the world.
But the thin, high-altitude sunlight that filters through the windows
also reveals the unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   There are ceiling tiles painted with the yin-and-yang symbol of
Taoism--a nod to the influence of indigenous art and culture. Other
tiles depict the lotus blossom found in Buddhist iconography. The
worshipers themselves are clad in colorful dress, the women's heads
wrapped in magenta scarves that serve as bright reminders of who they
are.</TE>
<TE>   They are Tibetans. And unlike the vast majority of their
people--Buddhist practically by definition, followers of the Dalai
Lama--most Tibetans of this village in China's Yunnan province are
Roman Catholic. In their elegant church, built by European
missionaries a century ago, they cling to their faith as tenaciously
as their homes cling to the hillsides above the swirling Mekong
River, high up on the Tibetan plateau.</TE>
<TE>   How this and a few neighboring communities blossomed into unlikely
Christian outposts on the roof of the world is a fascinating tale of
East meeting West and of the enduring power of faith.</TE>
<TE>   As the Catholic Church worldwide searches its soul over
allegations of sexual abuse, the 600 or so believers here continue to
go about their spiritual life untouched by faraway controversies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they too must struggle to survive, nestled here on majestic
but forbidding mountains that feed into the Himalayas. There is no
resident priest to guide them. Their young have decamped to the
cities. Local officials discriminate against them.</TE>
<TE>   But their faith endures. Through decades of war, privation,
internecine strife and official persecution, the Catholics in this
area have held on to their religion with as much fervor as the
Buddhists whose plight has captured the imagination of so many in the
West.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that neither man nor the government can vanquish
faith," declared Father Tao Zhibin, the young cleric who oversees the
flock scattered throughout the region. "Faith is in your heart."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cizhong, a village of about 1,000 people, lies in the upper corner
of Yunnan province, just over the border from Tibet proper. On the
edge of the massive Tibetan plateau, northwest Yunnan is home to
about 123,000 ethnic Tibetans.</TE>
<TE>   Only one road leads to Cizhong from the nearest town, three hours
away--a narrow, heart-stopping passage bounded by a rock face on one
side and a sheer drop of hundreds of feet on the other. Rain
frequently washes out the road, piling up boulders that have to be
blasted through with dynamite.</TE>
<TE>   Cizhong's inaccessibility makes it difficult for Tao, who comes
from the distant town of Dali in Yunnan, to visit and celebrate Mass
more than two or three times a year. Christmas, marked by dancing
around a bonfire, gets pushed forward or back from Dec. 25 to
accommodate Tao's schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Our priest is very precious to us," said Luo Shengcai, 35. "He
has to travel hither and yon, so we don't get to see him very often."</TE>
<TE>   Even the postman comes calling in Cizhong just twice a month.</TE>
<TE>   Yet every week, scores of committed believers gather in the
village's beautiful old church for intimate Sunday services. Men and
women sit on separate sides of the aisle on wooden slats. Sometimes
in unison, sometimes alternating between male and female voices, the
worshipers sing their hymns, Christian lyrics set to traditional
melodies of the Tibetan highlands.</TE>
<TE>   One family's worn little orange hymnal provides a clue to the
origins of this isolated Catholic community. Printed on its
frontispiece, in an old-fashioned typeface, is the title, "Chants
Religieux Thibetains," and the year and place the book was published:
1894, in Rennes, France.</TE>
<TE>   It was nearly 150 years ago that priests from the Foreign Missions
of Paris made their way onto the Tibetan upland, eager to spread
their gospel to what they considered a benighted land.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Tibet was a feudal kingdom where Buddhist lamas
reigned--not always peaceably--and serfs worked the land, their lives
brutish and short. The Buddhist monasteries were intolerant of
outside religions; foreigners were constantly attacked by brigands.
Arson destroyed the missions built in Cizhong and nearby Deqin; two
priests were murdered in 1905.</TE>
<TE>   Hostility persisted for decades, even after the clerics withdrew
to the border regions between Tibet and China's Yunnan and Sichuan
provinces. In the 1930s, weary of the conflict and bloodshed, the
French fathers turned the area over to the Swiss Mission of St.
Bernard, by order of the pope.</TE>
<TE>   In Cizhong, the Swiss priests ran a school, a seminary and a
hospital for the poor--which meant virtually everybody. On the
rippling green hillsides, they planted barley and grapes from Europe;
three families still harvest the grapes and press them into the wine
used for Communion.</TE>
<TE>   Xu Shadu, 69, remembers the Swiss priest who helped heal a gash in
his leg when he was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who was sick would go see him, because it was free," Xu
recalled. "People would give him eggs or cooking oil. But if you had
nothing to give, then you gave nothing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Father Alphonse Savioz ministered in Cizhong from 1948 to 1951, a
tense and violent period in Tibetan-Chinese relations that ultimately
resulted in Communist forces' overrunning the Buddhist kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "Under such conditions [on the Tibet-China border] it was
difficult to do the work of evangelization," said Savioz, who is now
83 and lives in Taiwan. "In the majority-Chinese areas, the missions
were looted and the fathers stripped of everything, even the clothes
off their backs."</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, one of Savioz's friends, Father Maurice Tornay, was
killed, allegedly at the hands of Buddhist monks. (Tornay was
beatified as a martyr by Pope John Paul II in 1993.) Savioz was
hauled in for repeated interrogation by the advancing Chinese, who
expelled him from the country in 1952, after taking over the whole of
Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   For the flock in Cizhong, left leaderless and helpless, the
arrival of the Communists meant the beginning of 30 years of
suppression.</TE>
<TE>   Their church, under whose curling eaves many had sought succor and
comfort, was turned into a public assembly hall. Communist propaganda
performances were staged where the altar had stood and where priests
had once blessed the wine and the bread.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners accustomed to kneeling in prayer were forced instead
to bow to Maoism. Bibles and other religious materials had to be kept
hidden in their homes. The authorities substituted daily Masses with
frequent ideological "struggle sessions" designed to reform
"misguided" thinking. Some believers, such as Luo Shengcai's
grandfather, were even shipped to labor camps.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, Cizhong's church was
spared destruction only because it was made of solid rock and because
the school there had continued to operate, residents say.</TE>
<TE>   But fanatical Red Guards defaced the building anyway, expunging
the Chinese and Tibetan inscriptions over the entrance that had
welcomed all those who labor and are heavy-laden. The Latin
inscription was left alone. "No one could understand it," said Liu
Wenzeng, the caretaker.</TE>
<TE>   What was inside hearts and minds was harder to erase, despite the
Communists' best efforts. In secret, the Tibetan Catholics baptized
their children and taught them the Scriptures. When confronted, they
would explain that they were just practicing local customs, which,
being in the Tibetan language, the Chinese authorities had no way of
understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "All the older folks continued to pray and practice their faith at
home," said Liu, 64. "They didn't dare do it in public."</TE>
<TE>   After China began to reform in the 1980s, the downtrodden
parishioners trickled back into the church, driving out the pigs that
were being housed there. On a visit in 1987, Savioz discovered little
left from the old days except--to his surprise and delight--a copy of
a Tibetan catechism with his own annotations and a sermon he had
written 40 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little by little, the congregants have restored the church as a
house of worship. Three years ago, they reinstalled statues of
Joseph, Mary and Jesus. Electricity also arrived that year. The front
is decked with artificial Christmas trees and lights year-round.</TE>
<TE>   As a crowning touch, the believers hope to replace the bell that
used to peal across the village, calling the faithful to prayer. The
state is no longer a major threat. Mostly, the church has been
subsumed by it. The Catholic parishes in the region, perhaps 40,000
to 50,000 people, are now supervised by China's government-run
Catholic Church, which does not recognize the authority of the pope.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this does not diminish the worshipers' zeal or affect their
private devotion to the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, said Tao, the overseeing priest, elements of the local
style of worship are even more traditionally Catholic than in the
West, since the congregation uses prayer books, translated into
Tibetan, that date to the early 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   What continues to trouble the church is its relations with
Buddhist local leaders. Most of China's 4.6 million Tibetans, in
Tibet proper and on the fringes, are disciples of the exiled Dalai
Lama's Yellow Hat sect of Buddhism. Religious violence is a thing of
the past, but the officials of Diqing prefecture, to which Cizhong
belongs, regularly favor Buddhists over Catholics, Tao said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, officials recently approved the construction
of a new Buddhist temple in Catholic-dominated Cizhong. But they have
so far failed to return confiscated land belonging to the church,
despite instructions from Beijing to do so--22 years ago. "Even the
Cultural Revolution lasted only 10 years," Tao complained.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, local tourism officials hit upon the idea of
charging visitors for admission to the church in Cizhong--and hired a
Buddhist ticket-taker to do it. The idea was scrapped after residents
refused to unlock the gates and angrily surrounded the tourism chief
when he came to check on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Another, more insidious threat to the Catholics here is their
slowly dwindling numbers. Many of the young have gone off to find
work in the cities and have become increasingly secularized, seduced
by modernity and materialism. New converts are not exactly plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yet the devout can take heart from the example of Xu, the man
whose leg was healed by one of the Swiss priests when he was a boy.</TE>
<TE>   Xu was born into a Buddhist family, then became an atheistic
Communist cadre after the Chinese took control of Tibet in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   But under the influence of his devoutly Catholic wife, and still
impressed by the missionaries' kindness to him nearly half a century
before, Xu converted to Catholicism 10 years ago. Pasted on his
living room wall these days is an incongruous triptych of icons:
Jesus in the middle, Mao Tse-tung on the left, soldiers of the
People's Liberation Army on the right.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday mornings, Xu walks down the narrow dirt track to the
church and joins fellow believers in two hours of praying, singing
and reciting of Scripture.</TE>
<TE>   When Tao is not present to celebrate Mass, the service is led by
church elders--the long-suffering believers who weathered decades of
hardship and persecution, the men and women who sometimes wept when
Tao first began to make regular visits a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say to me: 'We're just like orphans, father. No one
takes care of us,' " Tao said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "their faith endured all that time, which just goes
to show that you can't take away what's in people's hearts."</TE>

<HD>World Must Act to End Hunger, Summit Is Told</HD>
<DH>Forum: Progress in battling poverty is too slow, U.N. chief
says. Conference in Italy is criticized for suggesting open trade as
a solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>A four-day conference on world hunger opened here amid heavy security
Monday, with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and others calling for
greater efforts to meet a goal set six years ago of halving the
number of hungry people by 2015.</LD>
<LD>   The summit, which on its opening day brought together 35 heads of
state or government and 4,000 delegates, was originally scheduled for
last November but was postponed out of fear that it would attract
violent protesters.</LD>
<LD>   "In a world of plenty, ending hunger is within our grasp," Annan
told the summit's opening session. "Failure to reach this goal should
fill every one of us with shame. The time for making promises is
over. It is time to act. It is time to do what we have long promised
to do: eliminate hunger from the face of the Earth."</LD>
<TE>   Some critics of the summit's approach to easing poverty and hunger
partly through open trade have also gathered here. They staged a
peaceful demonstration Saturday and attended a parallel meeting of
nongovernmental organizations. But the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization, which planned the official event, does not appear to be
an attractive target for violence-prone demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi withdrew Rome's
commitment to play host to the meeting after anti-globalization
protests erupted in violence at a Group of 8 summit in Genoa in July.
His government later agreed to the Rome venue.</TE>
<TE>   A World Food Summit held here in 1996 set the goal of reducing the
number of poorly fed people to 400 million from about 800 million at
the time of that conference. Since then, the number of hungry people
has fallen by about 8 million a year, according to FAO statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations estimates that $11 billion is spent each year
on agricultural assistance and that it would take an additional $24
billion annually to reach the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Annan noted Monday that the basic problem is poverty, rather than
a lack of sufficient food in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no shortage of food on the planet," he said. "But while
some countries produce more than they need to feed their people,
others do not, and many of these cannot afford to import enough to
make up the gap. Even more shamefully ... there are countries which
have enough food for their people, and yet many of them go hungry."</TE>
<TE>   Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told summit participants
that the international framework for battling hunger must be debt
relief for the most impoverished nations, the opening of markets in
the industrialized world and promotion of investment in poorer
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The main problem related to food ... is to bring to the world's
poorest rural areas decent living and working conditions, higher
household incomes, social services, education and health," Ciampi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar were the
only two heads of government from major industrialized nations to
attend Monday's session, prompting criticism from several speakers
about the absence of others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absurd that at the G-8 summits, the rich do not let the poor
participate," said Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni. "What is even more
absurd is that when the poor invite the rich to their summit, they
don't show up."</TE>
<TE>   At the informal shadow summit, French
farmer-turned-anti-globalization activist Jose Bove said the
relatively junior delegations sent by the world's richest countries
showed a lack of commitment to the problem of hunger.</TE>
<TE>   "France is not here....The United States is not here," Bove said.
"All these countries don't care about this. What they want is to sell
more food to the southern [developing] countries. They don't want
these people to have their own agriculture to feed their own
population."</TE>
<TE>   The United States is represented at the summit by a delegation
headed by Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said in his speech that by some estimates, 24,000 people die
each day from starvation or diseases made fatal by malnutrition. He
warned that "today, for the first time in a decade, several countries
in the southern African region face a risk of outright famine over
the coming months."</TE>
<TE>   Annan also cited the complex relationship between world hunger and
agricultural subsidies in rich nations, which can lead to exports of
inexpensive food.</TE>
<TE>   "By lowering food prices in the poorest countries, [such
subsidies] may help alleviate hunger in some cases and in the
short-term only," he said. "But dumping surpluses can also have
devastating long-term effects," such as reduced farm production and
higher unemployment in impoverished countries.</TE>
<TE>   South African President Thabo Mbeki said rich nations must free up
their heavily subsidized agricultural markets so that farmers in the
developing world can compete on fairer terms.</TE>
<TE>   Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was among heads of state at the
summit who drew the greatest attention. Despite being barred in most
circumstances from travel to the European Union, he was able to
attend the Rome summit under an exception for meetings of
international organizations. The ban was imposed after Mugabe refused
to allow EU observers to freely monitor elections in February.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that mismanagement by Mugabe, including the violent
takeover of white-owned farms, is the fundamental cause of a food
crisis in Zimbabwe. Mugabe says the main problem is drought. The
World Food Program estimates that half of Zimbabwe's people will need
food aid to avert starvation this year.</TE>

<HD>India Will Reopen Airspace to Pakistani Commercial Flights</HD>
<DH>Asia: Other sanctions remain, but New Delhi says it will
consider additional conciliatory gestures as tensions over Kashmir
ease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>In a cautious gesture to Pakistan, India's government announced
Monday that it will reopen its airspace to Pakistani commercial
flights, but it left several other significant sanctions in place.</LD>
<LD>   India will consider more conciliatory steps as it continues to
assess whether Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf is keeping his
promise to permanently end the infiltration of separatist fighters
into India's Jammu and Kashmir state.</LD>
<LD>   For now, Indian airports remain closed to Pakistan International
Airlines flights, diplomatic sanctions are still in place, and
several hundred thousand Indian soldiers continue to be on full alert
along the border.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan welcomed India's announcement to reopen its airspace as a
positive move.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a step in the desired direction, but a lot more needs to
be done," Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan told the
national news agency, Associated Press of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   India is expected to take more steps after U.S. Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld pays a visit due to start today.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi is set to name a new ambassador, or "high commissioner,"
to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, and is returning some of its navy
to port, according to British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw. He told
Parliament in London on Monday that his Indian counterpart, Jaswant
Singh, had informed him of the moves by phone.</TE>
<TE>   India had moved five navy ships, which are believed to be capable
of firing nuclear weapons, off Pakistan's Arabian Sea coast after
gunmen killed 34 people, most of them the wives and children of
Indian army soldiers, on May 14. Musharraf condemned the attack as
terrorism and denied that Pakistan was involved.</TE>
<TE>   But India is skeptical of the official denials.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said Monday that her
government is still monitoring the situation to see whether Musharraf
is keeping a promise to permanently end what India calls
"cross-border terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "There is some fall in infiltration, but difficult to say if it is
a definite trend," Rao told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The only sanction officially lifted Monday was the ban on
commercial Pakistani aircraft flying through Indian airspace, which
New Delhi imposed Jan. 1 in retaliation for what it called Pakistan's
support for a Dec. 13 terrorist attack on India's Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen people, including the five gunmen, died in the assault,
which brought the two nuclear-armed neighbors to the brink of their
fourth war. They have teetered back and forth now for several months.
A terrorist attack pushes them closer to war, and a diplomatic
mission pulls them back again.</TE>
<TE>   Although tensions are easing, the countries are still only a major
terrorist strike, or a military miscalculation, away from all-out war
between a combined nearly 1 million troops that are mobilized on
their border.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, Musharraf cautioned against overestimating the
impact of recent diplomatic activity that has brought a perceptible
easing of tensions between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the forces remain deployed and there is a capability
... to take action on short notice, the danger is not over," he told
reporters prior to his departure for a three-day visit to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   However, Musharraf's decision to go ahead with his trip was itself
interpreted as a sign that conditions had eased. Still, the Indian
army says fighters continue to penetrate from Pakistani-held areas.</TE>
<TE>   India estimates that there are between 3,500 and 4,000 militants
in Jammu and Kashmir, fighting either for independence or union with
Pakistan. Approximately the same number are waiting in Pakistan-held
areas to enter India, New Delhi says. Roughly one-third of the
disputed territory of Kashmir is under Pakistani control.</TE>
<TE>   The heaviest infiltration is normally across a 1972 cease-fire
line that divides India and Pakistan, called the Line of Control.
India oftenaccuses Pakistani forces of opening fire as cover for
infiltrators.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani shelling about 20 miles west of the border city of Jammu
killed at least two civilians and injured three Monday, Indian police
reported. Mortar fire injured an Indian soldier north of Jammu.
Pakistan said Indian fire had forced thousands of civilians to flee.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld is likely to press India to withdraw at least some of its
troops from the front lines so that Pakistan can concentrate forces
on its western border with Afghanistan, where they are assisting the
U.S.-led hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   But Indian officials have said they aren't likely to pull back
soldiers in significant numbers until planned elections are held in
Jammu and Kashmir in October.</TE>
<TE>   The vote is central to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee's attempt to neutralize the rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir,
which has cost at least 33,000 lives in the last 13 years. Some
Kashmiri activists put the number of dead or missing as high as
80,000.</TE>
<TE>   India's arrest of firebrand Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali
Shah Geelani and his son-in-law on Sunday is seen as part of that
same plan. Geelani is a former head of the loose alliance of Kashmiri
groups called the All Party Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police arrested the two men under the draconian Prevention
of Terrorism Act, and they accused Geelani of secretly funneling
about $98,000 from Pakistani military intelligence to militant groups
since the beginning of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I am seen as a terrorist with an anti-Indian stance, the
fact remains that I had been fighting for the restoration of peace in
the Kashmir Valley," Geelani told reporters as he was led off to
jail.</TE>
<TE>   However, by having Geelani arrested, reportedly after Cabinet
ministers in his inner circle approved, Vajpayee risks undermining
his effort to have a government in Jammu and Kashmir that can claim a
democratic mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee admits that there hasn't been a fair election in the
state for more than a decade and insists that he is going to make
sure this fall's vote is aboveboard.</TE>
<TE>   But it will now be even more difficult for moderates in the
Hurriyat Conference to argue against a boycott of the elections
threatened by the group's more extreme members. And without a
representative government, many Kashmiris may see no alternative to
the gun.</TE>

<DL>KALANDIYEH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Instead of presiding over the first session of his newly seated
Cabinet, an increasingly isolated Yasser Arafat spent Monday trapped
in the remnants of his shattered headquarters as Israeli tanks and
helicopters laid siege to the city of Ramallah.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time this spring that the Palestinian leader has
been hemmed into house arrest by the Israeli government. On Monday,
while dozens of tanks groaned in the streets of Ramallah and the
smoke of shelled buildings climbed into the sky, Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon posed beside a White House fireplace and
bemoaned the lack of a regional peace partner. At his side, President
Bush said "Israel has a right to defend herself" from an escalating
string of Palestinian attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In what has become routine, Israeli soldiers thundered into
Ramallah before dawn Monday, ordered everybody to stay behind locked
doors and swept through the streets of the West Bank city in search
of radicals. By nightfall, two bomb-rigged cars and 27 suspected
activists had been rounded up, including a would-be suicide bomber
who was "ready to be sent," according to Israeli Defense Minister
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Israel demolished most of Arafat's compound with
dynamite, tanks and bulldozers. On Monday, Israeli officials
insisted, soldiers ringed the headquarters only to keep fleeing
Palestinian gunmen from seeking shelter within its broken walls. The
raid was a swipe at the militants of Ramallah, Israelis said--not a
punishment of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have intelligence, we have no choice but to go in there
and take action," Ben-Eliezer said.</TE>
<TE>   Raids on Palestinian villages have become so common that jaded
Israeli officials now dismiss them as "routine patrols." Still, the
seizure of Ramallah was particularly swift and intense.</TE>
<TE>   The Reuters news agency, Abu Dhabi television and Jordanian
television were locked out of their offices when troops stormed a
building with a strategic view of a refugee camp. Soldiers blockaded
hospitals and crashed into the Ramallah police station to seize 30
patrolmen and caches of weapons. By midmorning, the Voice of
Palestine had cut its radio broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   One Palestinian was reported killed in the fighting, and two
injured. Two Israeli soldiers were wounded. It was late afternoon
before ambulances managed to reach the victims.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. workers spent hours in the scorching sun at this checkpoint
just outside Ramallah, trying to cajole Israeli soldiers to open the
gate for a moment. An ambulance was waiting to carry a woman across
for surgery, they argued. The soldiers refused--Ramallah, along with
its suburbs and refugee camps, was clamped tightly shut.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces also arrested about 15 suspects in the West Bank
city of Hebron on Monday, Palestinians said. The suspects will take
their places alongside the thousands already marking time in the
dusty tent cities that serve as makeshift military detention centers.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Israeli forces interrogated and locked away suspected
Palestinian militants, they freed an ailing Lebanese guerrilla
prisoner after 15 years in jail. Handcuffed Hezbollah fighter
Mohammed Barzawi was turned over to the International Committee of
the Red Cross at a border shack in what Israeli officials touted as a
humanitarian gesture. Israel is negotiating with Hezbollah for the
bodies of three soldiers captured by the Lebanese guerrillas two
years ago, Associated Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Ramallah siege forced Arafat's brand-new Palestinian
Cabinet to cancel its first meeting. Hours before the raids began,
the Palestinian leader had trimmed the Cabinet's ranks and shuffled
some ministers into different jobs. The reorganization was a response
to a widespread call for reform, and angry ministers accused Israel
of using the attack on Ramallah to cripple Arafat's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon "wants to weaken the Palestinian Authority and to destroy
the Palestinian infrastructure," Palestinian spokesman Yasser
Abed-Rabbo said. Minister Nabil Shaath accused Israel of trying to
"sabotage any progress."</TE>
<TE>   Since his compound was trashed last week, Arafat has been making
small shows of reform. On Sunday, Palestinian security forces
arrested a leader of Islamic Jihad, the radical group that claimed
responsibility for a massive car bomb that blew up alongside an
Israeli bus last week, killing 17 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Israeli raids take a hard toll on the Palestinians.
Ramallah has spent weeks this spring under strict curfew. On Monday,
its people steeled themselves for yet another siege.</TE>
<TE>   "The children are scared to death--they hear shooting all night
and they can't sleep," housewife Abeer Bahour said. Her 8-year-old
daughter was supposed to pick up her report card and begin summer
vacation Monday. Instead, the family spent the day cowering in dim,
stifling rooms, wishing they'd bought more bread.</TE>
<TE>   "We're afraid to open a window, afraid to step outside," Bahour
said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Former king Mohammad Zaher Shah announced Monday that he wants
neither to restore the monarchy nor to be elected head of state,
apparently pressured by President Bush's envoy to bow out of the
volatile loya jirga political process that will choose Afghanistan's
next leader.</LD>
<LD>   The move by U.S. and other Western emissaries delayed the
long-awaited grand assembly and drew rebukes from democratic
watchdogs and the king's supporters as clumsy interference in Afghan
affairs and a hindrance to national reconciliation.</LD>
<LD>   Although the swelling ranks of loya jirga delegates were eager to
debate how best to rule and rebuild their war-battered country, the
convocation was twice delayed at the suggestion of the foreign
observers. Bush's envoy, Afghan-born academic Zalmay Khalilzad, said
the delays were called after "confusion" arose about the king's role
in the transitional government that the weeklong assembly will
choose.</LD>
<TE>   "We have an interest in what happens in Afghanistan. We want this
process to succeed," Khalilzad said, confirming that he had spent
hours meeting with Zaher Shah late Sunday and Monday in search of
"clarity" about his political ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad announced two hours ahead of the former king that the
frail Zaher Shah had decided against taking any leadership position
and was throwing his support behind interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai. He said the loya jirga that was supposed to open Monday
morning was postponed after two broadcast interviews given by Zaher
Shah "caused some consternation and confusion."</TE>
<TE>   "It appears those reports were incorrect, that the former king is
not a candidate for any position in the transitional authority and
endorses and supports the candidacy of Chairman Karzai for the
presidency," Khalilzad told reporters summoned to the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. envoy also accompanied the silent king and his glum
entourage for a terse announcement read by an advisor on Zaher Shah's
behalf that he was withdrawing from consideration as head of state.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah has said repeatedly since returning in April from three
decades in exile that he would leave it up to the Afghan people to
decide whether to restore the monarchy or give him any ceremonial
role as father of the nation. The 87-year-old has also indicated that
if he were to be brought back to power he would collaborate with
Karzai, the charismatic Pushtun who has managed to maintain relative
peace and keep ethnic rivalries in check during his six-month tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Push for Former King</TE>
<TE>   Some Western diplomats here have for months been casting the loya
jirga as a rubber-stamp body that will empower Karzai to oversee
billions in international reconstruction aid and political
institution-building ahead of nationwide elections planned for spring
2004.</TE>
<TE>   But as the 1,500-plus loya jirga delegates from throughout
Afghanistan began arriving here late last week, it became
increasingly apparent that many had been urged by their constituents
to vote for Zaher Shah rather than Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   The loya jirga tradition is 1,000 years old and has always been
chaotic. The current assembly might have been expected to thrash out
some division of powers that could appease both royalists and
republicans. There had been much discussion in the lead-up to the
convocation of bestowing some symbolic role on the king while vesting
executive power in a presidency or prime minister's post to be filled
by a more active figure, such as Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   By stepping in ahead of the gathering to secure the king's public
assurances that he seeks no office, the U.N. and diplomatic advisors
to the loya jirga organizing commission might have confirmed many
Afghans' fears that their future is being decided by outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Senior figures in the ousted royal family said Zaher Shah should
be free to take up any role Afghans want for him and that the former
monarch has been strong-armed into throwing his support behind
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "The role of my father is very important here. The people of
Afghanistan want only him," said Mirwais Zaher, one of the monarch's
younger sons. "The people want my father to have an important
position in which he is in control."</TE>
<TE>   He said the power-brokering that has sidelined the former king
won't put an end to other family members' desires to serve the
people. "No one can stop us from doing something for Afghanistan.
It's my right, and no one can stop me."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the maneuvering became public, the delays and the
external influence were disgruntling loya jirga delegates. Frontiers
and Tribal Affairs Minister Amanullah Zadran told journalists that
the Pushtun delegates were threatening to walk out of the forum
unless the king was allowed to run for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Observers from democratic assistance groups, such as Alexander
Thier, senior analyst in Kabul for the International Crisis Group,
warned that the delegates would see the handling of Zaher Shah as
foreign interference.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that the king is standing down before the loya jirga
even begins, that he is abdicating any role, is going to be extremely
detrimental inside the tent," Thier said. "It is inexplicable to me
why the U.S. government would feel the need to announce this fact
before the king and before the prime minister."</TE>
<TE>   Speculating that Khalilzad had been warned by Northern Alliance
commanders of a military coup if Zaher Shah is elected, Thier warned
that the foreign advisors were sending the wrong signal to Afghans by
caving in to the law of the gun.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Tajiks from the Northern Alliance, which helped U.S. forces
overrun the Taliban, now run the defense, interior and foreign
ministries.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether appeasing them was preferable to risking armed
insurrection, Thier said removing the king from contention was a
simpler but short-term solution. "It's always easier when you have
only one candidate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtun Resentment</TE>
<TE>   Pushtuns have been resentful of the Northern Alliance domination
of the Karzai Cabinet. Allowing the armed minority to drive the
king-- a Pushtun--out of contention will only intensify that
resentment, the analyst said. "People in this region already believe
the U.S. hand is everywhere, that foreign hands are everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad traveled to the Panjshir Valley home of Foreign Minister
Abdullah last week for what he cast as a short vacation. The valley,
which was the power base of slain Northern Alliance commander Ahmed
Shah Masoud--killed by suspected Al Qaeda suicide bombers just before
the Sept. 11 attacks--is also home to other Cabinet members
distrusted by southern Afghans, including Interior Minister Younis
Qanooni and Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Alliance figures also flexed their muscle late Sunday
when national intelligence chief Mohammed Arif sent armed undercover
agents into the loya jirga compound, in violation of regulations that
allow only uniformed security troops to carry weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Khalilzad said he and other diplomatic observers stepped in to
help clarify the situation and to urge the Afghans to "get their act
together."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah, though a Pushtun, enjoys deep respect across ethnic
lines in Afghanistan for the relative peace and prosperity that
marked his 40-year reign. He was deposed in 1973 by a jealous cousin
while on a trip to Italy and remained there until his return in
April.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the controversy over the former king's role, the
loya jirga has reportedly seen attempts at packing the assembly with
votes for Karzai. Although the ground rules drawn up for the meeting
specify the number of delegates should be 1,501, more than 2,000 had
shown up by early Monday, said spokesman Abdul Salam Rahimi.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 were chosen in district and regional shuras, an
Afghan version of the political caucus. But organizers set aside
other blocs of seats for intellectuals, government representatives,
refugees and emigres.</TE>

<HD>Aid Groups Say Israel Impedes Relief Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The U.N. ambulance had just dropped off a patient in critical
condition at a West Bank hospital and was headed back to a nearby
refugee camp when it came under fire. One bullet narrowly missed the
oxygen tank. A second came within inches of a nurse's head. A third
entered the back of 43-year-old assistant Kamal Hamdan, piercing his
aorta and killing him almost immediately.</LD>
<LD>   "It was clearly gunfire from an Israeli position," Richard Cook,
director of operations for the U.N. Relief Works Agency in the West
Bank, said of the March 7 incident. "We had our flag lit with a
floodlight; it was marked with a red cross and the U.N. emblem; we'd
made several runs that day; and they knew we were in the area."</LD>
<LD>   Arrests, deportations, visa and travel restrictions, checkpoint
harassment, threats, injuries and deaths are among the impediments
that humanitarian groups say they're facing at the hands of Israeli
immigration and military authorities as they struggle to deliver
food, medicine and humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands
of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   "We in no way condone what is done from the other side with the
suicide bombers and understand the Israeli need for security," Cook
said. "If there's some sort of problem, show us the proof. But stop
targeting our ambulances and stop killing our staff."</TE>
<TE>   While international relief agencies voice some of the greatest
frustration, Israeli groups aren't exempt. Add up the pieces,
humanitarian groups say, and you have at best a loosely disciplined
army with control problems, at worst a concerted campaign against
anyone trying to assist Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government and military officials strongly deny any
discipline problems or any policy to hamper aid efforts, adding that
any delays, gunfire or inconveniences are solely the result of real
or perceived threats linked to their fight against Palestinian
militias and suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "Every incident has a reason--either information of a roadside
bomber, intelligence that a terrorist is going to come through or
sometimes traffic, just like New York City," said Capt. Joseph Levy,
military aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip. "We're doing everything
to help humanitarian groups.... [But] it's a war zone. If you're
going into an area with shooting, you take your chances."</TE>
<TE>   Suzie Mordechay, a member of the Jerusalem-based Israeli Committee
Against House Demolition, insists there is another reason for the
difficulty aid groups face.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israeli military doesn't want humanitarian workers in these
areas because the army's doing a lot of things that violate
international law and don't want it reported," she said. "They always
give reasons, like the area's booby-trapped, blah, blah, blah, so
they can't let ambulances in to help wounded people. But that's just
an excuse to close things off to world scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the aide killed in March, the U.N. agency says that
a doctor, nurse and two ambulance drivers have been wounded while
trying to deliver food and medicine--all but one wearing U.N. vests.</TE>
<TE>   Save the Children USA coordinator Sarah Saleh said an Israeli
soldier fired warning shots over her head--followed quickly by an
offer to improve his aim.</TE>
<TE>   "Soldiers seem to have a lot more impunity now to do what they
wish," Saleh said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Israel's Haaretz daily newspaper, about 200 people
identifying themselves as humanitarian aid workers have been denied
entry to Israel in the last few months, with about 50 others
expelled.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime foreign aid workers in the region also say they're coming
under far greater scrutiny as once-routine visas are delayed,
downgraded or denied.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably more damaging to day-to-day operations, agencies say, are
new restrictions placed on their Palestinian staff members. As
checkpoints, tightened travel requirements and searches are stepped
up against all Palestinians, staff members are unable to leave their
homes or visit their Jerusalem headquarters, attend conferences or
deliver humanitarian aid.</TE>
<TE>   Most local employees have passed security checks for years to
obtain their credentials, aid executives say. Many have worked at
organizations for a decade or more and are well-known to the Israeli
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions on movement are so onerous that many agencies say
privately they're forced to turn a blind eye as their workers take
risks, slipping across back roads themselves to save their jobs. "At
what point do you fire someone who can't get into the office, adding
injury to insult?" one senior aid official asked. "At other times,
we've all had to resort to smuggling our staff in."</TE>
<TE>   A few agencies have brought in foreign drivers and diplomatic
vehicles to move across the barriers at enormous additional expense.</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies argue that their special status under the Geneva
Convention and their rights outlined under numerous U.N. resolutions
are routinely ignored under an overly broad definition of security.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our right," said Dan Simmons, local head of the aid group
World Vision. "We're just trying to get them to uphold
[international] laws."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials counter that the U.N. is biased against Israel.
They also say the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to the West Bank or
Gaza Strip because they aren't "occupied" territories as outlined in
the convention but are instead "disputed" territories--an argument
that's not accepted by the international community.</TE>
<TE>   Agency directors say they understand the pressure that Israel's
military is under and make every effort to comply with added
reporting requirements, passport numbers, license plates, names and
other details despite fluid field conditions. Even so, they say, they
often reach checkpoints at the appointed time only to have soldiers
hold them up for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Some blame an Israeli military structure that seems to give a lot
of discretion to low-level soldiers. Others say many in the military
appear to view them as an enemy solely because they're providing aid
to the needy from the same ethnic group as those the army is
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "They think, since we're assisting Palestinians, we're a threat,"
said Don Rogers, regional head of Catholic Relief Services. "As we
see it, assistance and some semblance of trust is the only way to
have real security and to end the cycle of violence."</TE>
<TE>   Still others say they suspect that their status as outside
observers may represent a threat to some.</TE>
<TE>   "When Israeli spokesmen say they're not impeding humanitarian aid,
that's a plain, flat-out lie. This policy comes right from the top,"
said Thomas Neu, Jerusalem-based director of Americans for Near East
Refugee Aid and a dean of the aid community. "We're witnesses to a
lot that's going on in the West Bank.... And I think all these
restrictions are a sneaky way to punish the Palestinians without
having it show up on CNN."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government and military officials acknowledge that there
have been some problems but say these are unusual times and they're
doing their best. Avraham Lavine, international relations coordinator
for the last three decades with the Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry, says Israel's long-term record on humanitarian aid is
exemplary.</TE>
<TE>   While coordination between different Israeli ministries sometimes
runs into glitches, he said, his office is close to a solution on the
visa issues. Palestinian travel permit issues, he added, are up to
the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact they're frustrated, I understand completely," Lavine
said. "In some cases, we can alleviate some difficulties; in others,
we can't."</TE>
<TE>   The military's Levy added that the army is very disciplined, among
the best organized in the world, and in no way sets out to harass aid
groups. In fact, he said, the army is doing many things to support
aid agencies' efforts on behalf of ordinary Palestinians, and has
allowed a joint Israeli-Palestinian industrial park to continue
functioning despite an armed attack there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. and European officials have raised their frustrations
repeatedly with their Israeli counterparts at the highest levels, so
far without much result. In the meantime, groups say they'll keep
trying to do their job under difficult circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.N., we don't know of another conflict area in the world
where we've had these problems--even in Kosovo," said the U.N.
agency's Cook. "The problem is, the goal post keeps changing."</TE>

<DH>Mideast: 'No one has confidence' in Arafat Cabinet,
president says after meeting with Israeli leader. U.S. now devising
plan for conference.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Culminating six weeks of talks with key Middle East
leaders, President Bush met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
on Monday and now faces the tricky task of sorting through disparate
positions to develop a proposal to revive the peace process for the
region.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's goal is to outline that plan before convening
an international conference, which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
still hopes will be held in late July, according to U.S. officials.</LD>
<LD>   But Bush signaled concerns Monday about the conference, largely
because of frustration with Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat. A day after Arafat announced a round of relatively minor
reforms to his leadership circle, Bush said the Palestinian leader
had not done enough.</LD>
<TE>   "The conditions aren't even there yet," Bush said when asked about
his plans for the conference. "That's because no one has confidence
in the emerging Palestinian government. So, first things first."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat must create a governing structure that would offer the
Palestinian people hope and give Israel confidence that a reformed
government will be one it can trust, Bush told reporters as Sharon
sat at his side in the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms should include increased security steps,
anti-corruption measures and a greater reliance by Palestinian
institutions on the rule of law, enforced by a court system, the
president said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he remains disappointed that Arafat "has not led in such
a way that the Palestinian people have hope and confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon continued to press the administration not to deal with
Arafat. "We must have a partner for negotiations. At the present
time, we don't see yet a partner with whom we'll be able to move
forward," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The administration will now "turn inward" to discuss the diverse
ideas, appeals and recommendations it has received from leaders of
Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt and Israel. These officials
began their pilgrimages to Washington in late April, after Bush's
decision to become more involved in the Middle East peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where the really hard part begins," a State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon came to Washington--only a month after his last visit and
for the sixth time since Bush took office--to urge the administration
to reject the Arab argument that the United States should propose a
definite timeline for creation of a Palestinian state in no more than
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders, most recently Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
talks with Bush on Saturday, have said that such a move would
generate hope among the Palestinians and diminish the leverage of
extremists. But Bush said after meeting with Mubarak that "we're not
ready to lay down a specific calendar."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon was pleased with the outcome of his White House visit, said
an Israeli official involved in the discussions. "We think we got our
ideas across," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The official added that two of the most contentious issues
critical to any final settlement of the Middle East conflict--the
borders of a Palestinian state and Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip--did not come up in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in his public comments, appeared to accept Israel's predawn
encirclement of Arafat's headquarters in the West Bank city of
Ramallah on Monday, the second incursion in less than a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel has a right to defend herself," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   The comments were in stark contrast to Bush's tough words during
Israel's five-week incursion into the West Bank this spring, which
included a siege of Arafat's compound.</TE>
<TE>   But White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Washington will be
"closely monitoring" Israeli military activities. "The United States
again reminds Israel about the importance of remembering the
repercussions of whatever action Israel takes today impacting the
broader goals of achieving peace tomorrow," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon requested the session with Bush and a meeting with
congressional leaders today to follow the weekend talks between Bush
and Mubarak, which were held at the Camp David presidential retreat
in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak had been scheduled to be the final Middle East leader to
visit Bush, but Sharon wanted to try to have the last word, U.S.
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is now pitching to have its foreign minister make
another stop here within the next week to underscore its strong
commitment to the peace initiative of Crown Prince Abdullah, which
was accepted unanimously by the Arab League in March. It calls for
full Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for withdrawal by the
Jewish state from all Arab lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East
War.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Bush wants to do "a little thinking" before he
makes a decision on a U.S. peace proposal. The president would then
announce the plan in a major speech laying the groundwork for the
international conference.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli official involved in the White House discussions said
Sharon did not get a clear impression of what the United States
intends to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The process is still fluid," said the official.</TE>

<HD>City of Hope Wins Major Judgment</HD>
<DH>Courts: In the first stage of a case pitting the two
parties that launched the biotech era, Genentech is ordered to pay
the hospital $300 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County jury awarded City of Hope National Medical
Center $300.2 million in compensatory damages Monday after finding
that its former collaborator Genentech Inc. breached the 26-year-old
contract that launched the biotechnology revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Genentech-funded research at City of Hope produced the first
biotechnology drug, human insulin, creating an industry--and the
seeds of an epic legal battle that could play out in court for years
to come.</LD>
<LD>   By a 9-3 vote, jurors found that Genentech failed to pay the
Duarte-based cancer hospital royalties on nearly two dozen other
drugs, including the hepatitis B vaccine, that stemmed from City of
Hope research.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors also found, 10 to 2, that Genentech, based in South San
Francisco, acted with malice or fraud. The jury will reconvene next
week to determine punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   If the award withstands an expected appeal, it would be an
extraordinary potential windfall for medical researchers at City of
Hope, a world-renowned nonprofit cancer center with an annual budget
of $328 million and a pioneer of bone marrow transplants for cancer
patients. It also would be a huge financial blow to biotechnology
giant Genentech, an industry leader with $2.2 billion in annual
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the verdict was read in court, Genentech
attorney Robert Van Nest moved for a mistrial, citing what he called
irregularities with the voting. Specifically, he said, one juror cast
inconsistent votes.</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge Edward Y. Kakita denied his motion.</TE>
<TE>   In an impromptu news conference after the proceedings, City of
Hope attorneys were jubilant. General Counsel Glenn L. Krinsky said
the hospital planned to seek "substantial punitive damages." He
called Genentech a "wealthy company" that "should be punished."</TE>
<TE>   "We are ecstatic with the result," Krinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Appeal Expected</TE>
<TE>   The case represented the second time the lawsuit was tried. The
first case ended in October in a hung jury, with jurors split 7 to 5
in favor of Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech patent counsel Sean Johnston said in a telephone
interview that the company was disappointed but would have no
additional comment until the punitive phase is concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point, we'll take a step back and make some decisions,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech is expected to appeal the verdict, which exceeds the
company's annual profit, unless a settlement is reached in the coming
days. An appeal could tie the case up for several years; the suit was
filed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech had budgeted up to $500 million in the event of a
verdict against it, to cover both compensatory and punitive damages,
said Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst Jonathan Aschoff.</TE>
<TE>   The $300-million award "only leaves us $200 million of wiggle room
before we start going over the worst-case scenario," Aschoff told
Bloomberg News. "They'd be lucky to have the total downside to their
company be the $500 million they were talking about earlier."</TE>
<TE>   But the verdict won't have a big effect on the biotechnology
industry, because most research institutions today retain ownership
of patents and license them directly.</TE>
<TE>   The jury's decision came after 16 days of deliberations in a
dispute that dates to the start of the biotechnology age.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Genentech, then a start-up company with one employee,
agreed to fund research at City of Hope. The cancer hospital agreed
to give the patents on any discoveries to Genentech in exchange for
royalties on sales of products that resulted from those patents.</TE>
<TE>   Insulin Discovery</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, two City of Hope scientists became the first to produce
human insulin in bacteria, which went on to become the world's first
biotechnology drug. The scientists, Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura,
discovered a method of coaxing ordinary bacteria to produce insulin
and other human proteins.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech has paid City of Hope more than $302 million in
royalties on sales of human insulin and human growth hormone, a drug
that directly resulted from the collaboration. But Genentech did not
pass royalties on to City of Hope for drugs produced by third parties
that licensed the Riggs-Itakura patents from Genentech.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech claimed the contract did not require the company to do
so. But City of Hope said, and the jury agreed, that the company owed
it royalties on drugs produced by licensees.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope additionally claimed that Genentech hid the licenses
from the hospital to avoid paying royalties, an alleged pattern of
deceit that opened the door to punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, City of Hope attorney Morgan Chu charged that
Genentech used stalling tactics to keep the hospital at bay. He laid
out a document trail that began in 1986 in which hospital officials
repeatedly asked Genentech for information about third-party
licensees.</TE>
<TE>   Patent Licenses at Issue</TE>
<TE>   In December 1998, Genentech finally told City of Hope that it
planned to offer cheap, nonexclusive patent licenses--deals unlikely
to produce royalties for City of Hope.</TE>
<TE>   But the hospital was not told that the exclusive licensees had
begun producing drugs with total sales of $147 million, Chu said.
Genentech was receiving royalties on those sales, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech "did not disclose specific, large revenue-producing
licenses," Chu said. "That is deceitful."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital, in an aggressive tactic, put a string of former and
current Genentech executives on the stand, thus dominating the jury's
attention during the five-week trial.</TE>
<TE>   Most damaging to the company's case was the inconsistent testimony
of Thomas Kiley, a former Genentech general counsel, regarding a 1986
meeting with City of Hope representatives.</TE>
<TE>   In his deposition, Kiley said nothing of substance was discussed
at the meeting. But on the stand, he said he had told City of Hope at
the meeting about a technicality that meant the hospital would not
receive royalties on third-party drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Genentech argued that it was no secret that the
company had licensed the Riggs-Itakura patents.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Van Nest told jurors that the licenses were mentioned in
annual reports, news articles and Genentech's 1980 public stock
offering prospectus.</TE>
<TE>   A third-party license with Swiss drug maker Hoffmann-La Roche was
filed in its entirety with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Van Nest said.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope did not raise objections about royalties until 1998,
when the patents, first issued in 1987, were approaching their 2003
expiration, Van Nest said. (Royalties generally end when patents
expire and the technology enters the public domain.)</TE>
<TE>   Windfall for Hospital</TE>
<TE>   Jurors gave City of Hope less than what it was seeking, an
indication that they accepted Genentech's argument that City of Hope
should have known about the licenses sooner. The jury awarded City of
Hope an amount that dates from September 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Kakita ordered jurors not to discuss the case until the
punitive phase was finished.</TE>
<TE>   But the jury evidently concluded that claims before that date were
outside the statute of limitations. City of Hope had been seeking
$157 million on royalties on products sold before that date.</TE>
<TE>   City of Hope has denied that the lawsuit was financially
motivated. The verdict, nonetheless, represents a huge windfall for
the hospital, which has relied on royalties from the Riggs-Itakura
patents to help it meet its annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict also is a potential bonanza for Riggs and Itakura, who
attended the trial daily as spectators and also testified. Together,
the scientists stand to receive 10% of the award, or $30 million,
under a previous court settlement with the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But Krinsky, City of Hope's general counsel, said Monday that no
decision had been made on whether the jury award would be treated as
a royalty, and if so, how it would be distributed.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Beating of Boy, 13, by Deputies Is Probed</HD>
<DH>Crime: The teenager was hurt at a sheriff's program for

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said Monday that they are
investigating allegations that deputies beat a 13-year-old boy over
the weekend at a program for at-risk teens.</LD>
<LD>   Christian Preciado's family said he was severely beaten and choked
Saturday after he failed to do enough push-ups. He was attending
Vital Intervention in Directional Alternatives, a 16-week program
sponsored by the Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The family's lawyer, Howard Levine, said Christian received no
medical care after the incident at East Los Angeles College. Instead,
he stayed until the end of the day and then was taken to the hospital
by his family.</LD>
<TE>   "He looks pretty bad," Levine said Monday during a news conference
at the family's Boyle Heights home. The boy has bloodshot eyes and a
bruised face, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Richard Westin said the investigation is "a priority." More
than 40 witnesses will be interviewed, including staff members,
volunteers and participants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the family plans to file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Although the courts refer many teens to the program, Levine said
Christian's family decided to enroll him, at a cost of $90, because
he was having disciplinary problems at school.</TE>

<KH>JOHN GOTTI: 1940-2002</KH>
<HD>The 'Dapper Don' Was Last Celebrity Mobster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>John Gotti, the swaggering New York crime boss who became America's
most famous--and feared--Mafia figure, died Monday at a federal
prison hospital in Springfield, Mo., of complications of throat
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Gotti, who rose from the streets of the Bronx to run the Gambino
crime family, was 61. At the time of his death, he was serving a life
sentence for racketeering charges that included murder, loan-sharking
and extortion.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield said
Gotti, who had lapsed into a coma over the weekend, died at 12:45
p.m. EST. Prison officials will conduct an autopsy to determine the
exact cause of his death, according to a statement issued by prison
spokeswoman Diane Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike many organized crime figures who shun the spotlight, Gotti
became a national celebrity during his underworld career. He
alternately was known as the "Teflon Don," for his ability to escape
a series of federal prosecutions, and the "Dapper Don" for his habit
of wearing $2,000 Brioni suits and dining in New York's fanciest
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The subject of books, numerous magazine profiles and an HBO movie,
Gotti was the last great, famous gangster. He was a modern version of
the tough-talking, brawling Mafioso who captured America's
imagination for much of the 20th century. But even as he basked in
media attention, the clout of the Italian Mafia was ebbing
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors used the RICO law (Racketeering Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act) to jail a multitude of crime bosses by the
mid-1990s. They depleted the leadership of America's five organized
crime families. Gotti, who was convicted in 1992, was the last major
kingpin to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Since his incarceration, federal officials have jailed surviving
leaders of the Gambino family. The mobster's older brother, Peter,
who had taken over as the family crime boss, was arrested last week
along with two other family members. They were charged with
racketeering and money-laundering schemes involving the city's
waterfront. Gotti's younger brother, Gene, is serving a 50-year
sentence for heroin trafficking; his son, John Jr., is serving a
six-year sentence for racketeering and gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "The day they put John Gotti away marked the end of an era with
the mob in this country," said Jerry Capeci, coauthor of "Mob Star:
The Story of John Gotti" and "The Complete Idiot's Guide to the
Mafia."</TE>
<TE>   "He lived large and dared the government to come get him--but he
also showed that if you're going to run a crime family, you have to
run it like a secret society. You can't be full of bravado and hang
out on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, where the FBI has you under
constant surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   At the height of his powers, in the 1980s, Gotti presided over an
empire that raked in about $1 billion annually from prostitution,
narcotics, pornography, gambling, labor racketeering, stolen cars and
business fraud. Yet it was his reputation as a ruthless killer that
prompted federal prosecutors to target him as he climbed the
organized crime ladder.</TE>
<TE>   After three failed prosecutions, Gotti was convicted 10 years ago
of orchestrating the 1985 gangland execution of Paul Castellano, the
former Gambino family chief, outside Sparks Restaurant in Manhattan.
The sensational crime catapulted Gotti to national attention, but it
also proved to be his undoing. Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, a Gotti
associate who was linked to 19 murders, cut a deal with prosecutors
and testified that his boss had planned the sidewalk murder so he
could take Castellano's job.</TE>
<TE>   At the trial, Gotti's lawyers denied that he had any links to
organized crime, arguing that he was a $60,000-a-year plumbing
contractor. Bruce Cutler, one of his attorneys, suggested that Gotti
was a hard-working family man who inspired strong loyalty among his
neighbors in Howard Beach, Queens. The Gottis held an annual Fourth
of July barbecue for them, and Cutler suggested that in some
communities Gotti was an inspirational figure.</TE>
<TE>   The mobster also made good copy. Reporters loved to banter with
him as he walked up courthouse steps or through Little Italy in New
York City, his coiffed gray hair barely rippling in the breeze. "Are
you a crime boss?" a reporter once shouted to him. "I'm a boss,"
Gotti replied, "of my wife and family."</TE>
<TE>   To this day, there are Web sites in Gotti's honor, some
overflowing with personal testimonials to his generosity. But his
lengthy rap sheet, and the data unearthed by federal investigations,
tell a vastly different story.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a murderer, not a folk hero," said U.S. Atty. Andrew J.
Maloney in 1990, announcing Gotti's indictment for Castellano's
murder. And the evidence introduced at several trials--including
extensive federal wiretaps--underscored the image of Gotti as a
powerful crime boss who frequently erupted into raging, obscene
tirades against his enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth of 13 children, Gotti was born to a poor family in the
South Bronx. He dropped out of high school at 16 and fell in with one
violent street gang after another. Before 1969, he was arrested nine
times in New York and Long Island for street fighting, public
intoxication, car theft, gun possession and burglary, serving short
sentences in county prisons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, he was sentenced to three years in federal prison for a
bungled truck hijacking at New York's Kennedy International Airport.
He received a four-year sentence in state prison after pleading
guilty to attempted manslaughter in the bloody 1975 murder of a
Gambino family foe in a Staten Island bar.</TE>
<TE>   A fierce but unknown foot soldier, Gotti became a household name
in New York after he took over the Gambino family in 1985, following
Castellano's death. His celebrity soared when he was acquitted of
racketeering charges in 1987 and 1990. Brimming with
confidence--federal prosecutors called it arrogance--Gotti inspired
fear among those who crossed him inadvertently.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, a neighbor accidentally ran over and killed Gotti's
12-year-old son, Frank. The man, John Favara, began receiving
threatening phone calls after the incident and was planning to move
out of the neighborhood. But witnesses said he was beaten up by
several men as he walked in front of his home and was then stuffed
into a car. His body has never been found.</TE>
<TE>   After his 1992 conviction, Gotti spent his prison years largely in
solitary confinement. He was forced by crime family members to
officially relinquish his control of the Gambino organization in
1994, according to reports in the New York Daily News. Meanwhile, the
criminal empire he had built continued to disintegrate.</TE>
<TE>   Even the fabled Ravenite social club where Gotti operated in New
York's Little Italy disappeared. U.S. marshals seized the site in
1997, evicted the tenants and sold the building. It is now a hair
salon and boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors removed a cancerous tumor from Gotti's throat in 1998 and
initially expected him to fully recover. But his prognosis worsened,
and family members began making preparations for his death months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   John Gotti is survived by his wife, Victoria, and three children:
John Jr., Angela and Victoria, a novelist and columnist for the New
York Post.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A physician who ran a chain of laser eye clinics where he faked
operations was sentenced Monday to 21 months in prison for defrauding
Medicare.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Antoine L. Garabet, 46, of Glendora also was fined $200,000
and ordered to pay $264,653 in restitution. U.S. District Judge
Stephen Wilson stayed the sentence pending an appeal. Defense lawyer
Richard Marmaro, who had asked that Garabet be sentenced to community
service, said afterward that he was "very disappointed."</LD>
<LD>   Garabet and his Laser Eye Centers, a chain of 23 clinics, were
convicted by a federal jury in Los Angeles last year on four counts
of fraud. He was acquitted on six others. The California Medical
Board has since moved to revoke or suspend his license, alleging
gross negligence, incompetence and dishonesty. An administrative
hearing is pending.</LD>
<TE>   In the federal criminal case, Garabet was found guilty of telling
elderly Medicare patients that they had glaucoma or other retinal
diseases that could lead to blindness, and then persuading them to
undergo laser surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But Assistant U.S. Atty. Larry Ng, who tried the case, said the
surgeries were bogus. "He basically did a light show for them," Ng
said. "He went through the motions to make it appear that he was
doing something."</TE>
<TE>   Garabet also was accused of overbilling Medicare for surgeries
that were performed, but the judge dismissed those counts at trial.</TE>

<LD>A used-car lot will open at the southwest corner of Oxnard Boulevard
and 8th Street in Oxnard's Five Points.</LD>
<LD>   Although several used-car lots are located nearby, the Oxnard
Planning Commission unanimously approved the request by Durazo's Car
Sales because it would improve a blighted corner in a key commercial
area, commission members said.</LD>
<LD>   Owner Isidro Durazo plans to remodel a 993-square-foot building,
plant trees and shrubs along Oxnard Boulevard and put in a new
sidewalk along 8th Street.</LD>

<HD>Gunman Kills 2 Monks, Self at Abbey</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two others are gravely injured at the Missouri
monastery. The killer's motive is unknown; deputies find no link to
the facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONCEPTION, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The doors were always open at the Roman Catholic monastery. And the
Rev. Philip Schuster was always just inside them, greeting all who
entered with his trademark gentle smile.</LD>
<LD>   But the man who walked into Conception Abbey on Monday morning had
no answering smile, authorities said. He had a replica AK-47 and a
sawed-off .22-caliber rifle.</LD>
<LD>   And he came in shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Within minutes, Schuster was dead. So was Brother Damian Larson.
Two other monks were gravely injured. The abbey was in a terrified
uproar, monks huddling in closets, staff jumping out windows as the
gunman stalked the halls, firing at random.</TE>
<TE>   He squeezed off half a dozen shots with the AK-47. Then he strode
into the chapel and put the .22 to his temple. Authorities found him
dead, slumped over a pew.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded monks were identified as the Rev. Kenneth Reichert,
68, and the Rev. Norbert Schappler, 73. Reichert was listed in
serious condition and Schappler as stable.</TE>
<TE>   By late Monday, the Nodaway County sheriff had identified the
gunman as Lloyd Robert Jeffress, a 71-year-old loner living in a
retirement community in Kearney, Mo., about a 45-minute drive from
the sprawling red-brick monastery.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite knowing his name, authorities could offer few real
answers.</TE>
<TE>   They had not unearthed any ties Jeffress might have had to the
monastery and adjacent seminary. They had not found any notes in his
apartment or his car. They had not even tracked down any neighbors
who knew him beyond a "hello" in the halls. The only relative they
were able to contact was a brother, who said he had not seen Jeffress
in years.</TE>
<TE>   "My gut feeling is, he came here for a reason," Sheriff Ben Espey
said, squinting into a muggy sunset outside the silent abbey. "But I
tell you, we're not getting much dug up on this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffress had no criminal record, the sheriff said. At least one
gun, the AK-47, was properly registered in his name. Authorities were
still tracing the other rifle. A mysterious box, wrapped in duct
tape, found in Jeffress' car gave investigators a scare at
first--they thought it might contain explosives. It turned out to be
full of fishing reels.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to take time," Espey said with a sigh.</TE>
<TE>   He looked at the crime-scene tape stretched around the abbey
parking lot, at the state highway patrolman standing guard. Across
the street, TV crews were doing reports from the cemetery. The four
dozen monks in residence at Conception Abbey left earlier in the day,
to pray in private, away from their bloodstained chapel. They were
due back in the evening, hoping to reclaim the monastery as a place
of peace.</TE>
<TE>   "The doors were never locked," Espey said. "They will be tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Coming amid the spiraling scandal of sexual abuse in the Catholic
Church--a tragedy that police say led one alleged victim in Baltimore
to shoot a priest last month--the violence here immediately raised
questions about motive.</TE>
<TE>   Another well-known Missouri training ground for priests, St.
Thomas Aquinas Seminary in Hannibal, was the focus of some of the
earliest allegations of predatory priests this spring. Bishop Anthony
J. O'Connell of the Palm Beach, Fla. diocese resigned in disgrace in
March after acknowledging that he sexually abused two teenage
seminary students there years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the scandal has not touched Conception Abbey. And authorities
said there was no sign that the gunman had any connection with the
Benedictine campus. Still, some locals acknowledged they were haunted
by the possibility that the carnage could have been linked to the sex
abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it's on the minds of everybody today," said Matt
Chesnut, city manager of nearby Maryville.</TE>
<TE>   The victims, too, were on everybody's minds.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred shaken, grieving mourners packed the Catholic
church in Maryville for a memorial service as dusk settled over the
rolling cornfields and cattle pastures of northwestern Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "How many of you tonight, as you walked in the door, already had
tears in your eyes?" Father Chuck Tobin asked, his own voice choking.
"How many were ready to hug and console, even when in your heart and
your gut, you didn't know what you could possibly say to take the
hurt away?"</TE>
<TE>   Brother Larson, 65, was known far beyond the red brick buildings
of the monastery because of his passion for meteorology.</TE>
<TE>   A self-taught forecaster who dubbed himself the Weather Monk, he
made his predictions public through the abbey's Web site, and also
drew weather-related cartoons for local papers.</TE>
<TE>   But he did far more than predict rain and shine. Former seminary
students recalled him as always on the go, always fixing and
building, He recently built a replica of the Cathedral of Notre Dame
out of scrap wood cut from packing crates, just for the fun and
challenge of it.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet in the world,"
said Gregory Eufinger Jr., an attorney who serves on the seminary's
alumni board. "He always had a kind word to say."</TE>
<TE>   Father Schuster, 85, also reached out to the community beyond the
abbey. He worked for years as a missionary to Native American
reservations in South Dakota. Back at the monastery, he devoted
himself to teaching visitors about the Benedictine order and guiding
them toward spirituality. In addition, he was for years the chaplain
at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very revered as a wise, holy fellow," said Father Robert
Murphy, a seminary graduate who now leads a parish in Grandview, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, though he retired from his chaplain's post several years
ago, the hospital staff still remembers Schuster with devotion--and
still plays a recording of him reciting the Lord's Prayer over the
public-address system every morning.</TE>
<TE>   They played it as usual on Monday at 9 a.m.--even as authorities
were responding to the first reports of a shooting in Conception
Abbey. They plan to play it again today.</TE>

<HD>'Dirty' Bombs' Greatest Impact Likely Would Be
Psychological</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Attacks with radiological or "dirty" bombs would probably not cause
large numbers of immediate casualties, but they increasingly worry
U.S. officials because of the ease with which they could be carried
out and their ability to set off panic and inflict economic damage.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say even relatively unsophisticated terrorist groups would
probably be able to build radiation-dispersing car bombs with
conventional explosives and low-level radioactive waste from U.S.
hospitals and industry.</LD>
<LD>   If such a bomb were set off in downtown Washington or New York, it
would probably cause few if any immediate deaths. But as it raised
the level of radioactivity, it could spark panic, overburdening the
health-care system and perhaps forcing abandonment of many square
blocks for decades, experts say.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no question in my mind that terrorists could, fairly
readily, find some radiological material that they may wish to use,"
said William C. Potter, a specialist at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies in Monterey. "It is easier than I previously
believed. And with the knowledge and the motivation of terrorists,
that has me uneasy."</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult for terrorists to buy or steal a small
nuclear device from Russia, Pakistan or other nuclear-equipped
countries, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But security is far more relaxed for radioactive materials such as
cobalt, strontium and cesium that are used in medicine, in food
irradiation and a host of industrial processes.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, most experts believe there is more risk of a
dirty bomb attack than an attack with a "suitcase" nuclear bomb or an
attack on a nuclear plant.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorist could pack the irradiated material around an explosive
in a car or truck, then set it off. Even if wind conditions were not
optimal, the radioactivity could be dispersed widely enough to panic
the public, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington
conducted a study in March of the effects of an attack with a
4,000-pound dirty bomb set off in a bus parked outside the
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum on Washington's National Mall.</TE>
<TE>   The study assumed that the terrorists would use cesium-137, a
material that is widely used in medical treatment to treat cancer.
The substance emits beta and gamma radiation that can penetrate the
skin and lead to increased rates of cancer in healthy people.</TE>
<TE>   The study said such a bomb would contaminate about 20% of downtown
Washington, but would pose an increased rate of cancer or cataracts
only in the blocks immediately around the blast site.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the attack would cause many panicked residents to
evacuate the area, and would quickly disable many local emergency
response workers.</TE>
<TE>   Containing such an attack could cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars, and the number of people exposed could multiply quickly as
people flee to the suburbs or outlying areas, spreading
contamination, said Phil Anderson, a senior fellow at the center.</TE>
<TE>   "One person who has done their homework, acting alone, can do
significant damage, more psychological than real, to the United
States of America," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term consequences of a dirty bomb attack include
psychological effects on workers who might refuse to return to work
and parents who might refuse to return their children to school. The
local economy could stall while residents try to overcome their
shock, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   The strategic studies center found that participants in the
simulated attack, including the police and fire departments and the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, were "clearly not prepared to
deal with" the presence of radioactivity found in the bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear experts said the U.S. government is almost completely
unprepared for an attack by a terrorist intent on unleashing a
radioactive dirty bomb on the public. In states like California,
there isn't even an inventory of radioactive materials being kept by
the government, and other highly radioactive products like radium and
uranium are easily obtainable, said Jonathan Parfrey, executive
director of Physicians for Social Responsibility's Los Angeles
office.</TE>
<TE>   ''In California, we don't even know where the radioactive
materials are,'' said Parfrey. ''We are not even on top of it. A
terrorist could get some radioactive material that they could buy on
the Internet, detonate it in an urban area. I'm not talking about
thousands of people dying. But it would render the area uninhabitable
and pose a long-term cancer risk.''</TE>
<TE>   Parfrey said he's found sites on Ebay and elsewhere on the
Internet where radioactive materials can be purchased. ''You simply
wrap it with some TNT and detonate it, or you could just liberate the
stuff into an air conditioning vent,'' Parfrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas L. Neff, a physicist at MIT, said that the fear engendered
last fall by the mailings of anthrax is indicative of what could
happen in the wake of a dirty bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact on society can be very much out of proportion to the
magnitude of the initial event," Neff said. "You could have six
months of panic, with people refusing to go to work, before the
scientific evaluations catch up."</TE>
<TE>   A 1987 incident in Goiania, Brazil, illustrates the havoc that
could be caused by dirty bombs. An abandoned radiotherapy machine
containing cesium-137 was opened in a junkyard, exposing the blue,
glowing dust. Just four people died, but more than 34,000 people had
to be screened for exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Paul Richter, Alan C. Miller and Josh Meyer
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>14 Mexican Immigrants Die in Arizona Desert</HD>
<DH>Migrants: About 100 have been rescued from searing heat by
the Border Patrol since Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 14 Mexican immigrants have died and more than 100 have been
rescued in separate incidents across southern Arizona since Thursday,
the U.S. Border Patrol said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The latest fatalities were reported Monday, and involved a male
and female who apparently succumbed to triple-digit temperatures near
Tucson, said Ryan Scudder, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's Tucson
sector, which covers 84,000 square miles.</LD>
<LD>   "The only other time we've had so many deaths in so short a time
was a year ago last week, when 14 migrants died in the Yuma area," he
said. "But they were all part of one group.</LD>
<TE>   "The situation right now is scattered across the wide open
desert--trying to keep up with all the information coming in has been
difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The distress calls started coming in Thursday, when woman's body
was found within the sprawling Tohono O'Odham Nation's reservation
southwest of Tucson. The same evening, the Border Patrol found
another dead woman and rescued three others in the vicinity of Ajo,
Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Among a total of nine victims found on the reservation was a
2-year-old boy, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident Friday, a rescued man told of compatriots
who had been left behind in the desert. Border Patrol officials
backtracked and discovered a dead man and rescued six others.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another incident in the same general area, reservation
police and Border Patrol agents found one man dead and rescued 43
others. One of the survivors appeared in Tucson federal court Monday
on charges of alien smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   More bodies turned up Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the 45 miles
of desert between Tucson and Casa Grande, Scudder said.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were found in all variations of heat distress and
terrain," he said. "Some had water; some didn't. Some were dehydrated
before they started trying to walk across the Arizona desert.</TE>
<TE>   "In most cases, their smugglers promised it'd be an easy walk over
the border and on to Phoenix."</TE>
<TE>   The rugged, searing terrain along the Arizona-Mexico border has
become a popular corridor for immigrant smugglers since the inception
of various programs that have increased the number of border agents
around San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
unveiled an assortment of new measures and high-tech devices to
heighten security and safety along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   They included two 30-foot-high "rescue beacon" towers in the
desert outside of Yuma designed to emit distress signals.</TE>
<TE>   A metal plate posted at the base advises migrants in English and
Spanish: "If you need help, push red button. U.S. Border Patrol will
arrive in 1 hour. Do not leave this location." More beacons are
expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, with regional temperatures expected to hit 105 by
week's end, Border Patrol Agent David Bemiller said, "We've stepped
up our search and rescue patrols."</TE>

<LD>Researchers who thought tapping noises they captured on tape were
evidence that a possibly extinct type of woodpecker still survives
have been disappointed: The sounds were just gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   The ivory-billed woodpecker has not been seen in this country for
60 years, but a Louisiana State University student's detailed account
of a possible sighting in 1999 raised hopes that there are still some
around in Louisiana's Pearl River Wildlife Management Area.</LD>
<LD>   Last winter, Cornell University and Zeiss Sports Optics of
Chester, Va., set out equipment to record swamp sounds for two or
three months.</LD>
<TE>   Captured on tape were a series of distinctive double-raps,
reminiscent of the ivory-billed's distinctive rapping on dead wood.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, analysis of the ... data proved that the sounds were
distant gunshots, with reverberations that sounded to human ears like
drumming on a hollow snag," Zeiss Sports Optics said.</TE>

<LD>A heavy storm dumped as much as 4 feet of snow in the mountainous
northwest part of the state, leaving hundreds of residents without
power and stranding some tourists in Glacier National Park.</LD>
<LD>   Emergency officials in Browning, on the Blackfeet Indian
Reservation, turned a school gymnasium into a shelter for rural
residents who lost electricity and heat.</LD>
<LD>   "The power is still out in a lot of areas [and] there are no

<HD>Bush Backs Attacks on 'Freedom's Enemies'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush made a case Monday for preemptive strikes against
terrorists that seek weapons of mass destruction for use against the
United States and other nations, saying "we will oppose the new
totalitarians with all our power."</LD>
<LD>   "With the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons,
along with ballistic missile technology, freedom's enemies could
attain catastrophic power," Bush told a group of about 100 world
conservatives gathered for a White House dinner.</LD>
<LD>   "And there's no doubt that they would use that power to attack
us.... We will oppose the new totalitarians with all our power."</LD>
<TE>   In an earlier speech before the group, the International Democrat
Union, Vice President Dick Cheney said the United States will not shy
away from first strikes when it acts against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said a strike-first military policy is necessary because
past approaches to world security--Cold War deterrence, summits and
treaties--will not work against terrorists who have no single base of
operation and "nothing to defend."</TE>
<TE>   "Grave threats are accumulating against us, and inaction will only
bring them closer," he said. "We will not wait until it is too late."</TE>
<TE>   The IDU, a collection of conservative and moderate-to-right
politicians, responded favorably to Bush's anti-terrorism coalition.
The group issued a statement supporting the president's approach on
expanding the anti-terror fight and denying dangerous weapons to
"terrorists and hostile states."</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the coalition must be bold, not complacent, in
addressing these threats," the statement read. "The nature of this
threat and the risks of doing nothing to combat it must be clearly
understood. We support fully the policy that this threat must be
defeated."</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to formalize the "strike first" policy when he submits
his first national security strategy to Congress by early fall.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Monday that the document
would incorporate various foreign relations and national security
policies that Bush has articulated since Sept. 11, including new
demands that poor countries make political and economic reforms in
order to receive U.S. aid.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Cheney said, Iraq poses a threat because its leader,
Saddam Hussein, has shown a willingness to use weapons of mass
destruction and an ability to link up with terrorist networks.</TE>

<HD>Murder Trial Spotlights Reclusive Religious Sect</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Massachusetts couple are accused of allowing
their infant son to starve to death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAUNTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>A prophecy directly from God decreed that Karen Robidoux was vain and
prideful. For her sins, two witnesses testified Monday, Robidoux was
ordered to stop feeding solid food to her baby son, Samuel.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel and Renee Gordon--former members of a small religious group
known as the Body--told the court that as Samuel's mother struggled
to produce breast milk, the active, vibrant baby stopped crawling and
became so emaciated that the bones in his skull seemed to jut out.
Within weeks in the spring of 1999, he was dead.</LD>
<LD>   The father, Jacques Robidoux, a leader of the group that makes its
home in nearby Attleboro, is charged with first-degree murder. He sat
expressionless as the Gordons--husband and wife--described
confrontations with Robidoux over his son's rapidly declining health.</LD>
<TE>   "I told Jacques I didn't think this [message] was from God," said
Renee Gordon, 32. "And Jacques said this is from God. This is what we
have to do. And we have to have faith."</TE>
<TE>   Police located Samuel's body at a remote site in Baxter State Park
in northern Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robidoux, 26, will stand trial on second-degree murder
charges this year. Michelle Mingo--who ordered the fatal change in
Samuel's diet after she claimed to have received instructions from
God--is charged as an accessory after the fact.</TE>
<TE>   With testimony that has included passages from a diary kept by
29-year-old Jacques Robidoux, the trial has opened a window on a
reclusive religious group whose three dozen members believe they are
God's chosen people.</TE>
<TE>   Much of their strict philosophy comes from a book called "Born in
Zion." The members live communally and eschew institutions such as
government, law, education and medicine. For a time, members were
banned from wearing eyeglasses because sect leaders said God would
repair their vision.</TE>
<TE>   They operate a contracting business but avoid banks and conduct
most of their transactions in cash. They conduct weeklong religious
feasts marked by singing and expressive dancing but refuse to
acknowledge birthdays or other conventional celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   But, prosecutor Walter J. Shea insisted, the group was not singled
out for its beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a murder case," he said. "This is not a case about
religion. This is not a case about someone's choice of lifestyle.
This is a case about the very short life and the very slow,
excruciating death of a baby."</TE>
<TE>   Samuel, Shea said, "was murdered by the very people that brought
him into this world ... by his mom and dad."</TE>
<TE>   The child died just before his first birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Robidoux, who has professed an aversion to the legal
system, announced last week that he wanted to represent himself.
Judge Elizabeth Donovan turned down the request.</TE>
<TE>   In his journal, Robidoux wrote that Satan used the starving baby
to make his wife question her faith in God. He wrote of praying that
her breast milk would increase--but to no avail.</TE>

<HD>Raging Fire Bears Down on Denver</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Tens of thousands of residents get ready to flee and
even firefighters get out of its way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Fierce winds drove a massive wildfire toward Denver's southern
suburbs on Monday as authorities prepared to evacuate tens of
thousands of residents and entire towns in its path.</LD>
<LD>   The fire's growth astonished officials here--expanding from 300
acres to more than 75,000 in 24 hours. It was moving so fast Monday
that firefighters were ordered off fire lines.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze began Saturday in the Pike National Forest and raced
north, feasting on a vast swath of pine trees. It burned so hot that
it generated its own weather: Fire tornados swirled within the blaze,
columns of smoke shot up to 15,000 feet and a heat-created wind
scattered flames in all directions.</LD>
<TE>   The fire was throwing off so much heat that smaller fires were
igniting as much as a mile ahead of it. Smoke from the fire--the
largest in Colorado history--moved into Wyoming and Nebraska and
could be seen from space.</TE>
<TE>   Winds up to 35 miles per hour blew the fire to within 20 miles of
the Denver metropolitan area. Throughout the day, it moved toward the
city at about 2 miles per hour. By evening, 6,000 homes in four
counties south of Denver were evacuated. The Forest Service said up
to 40,000 residents could be sent to Red Cross shelters set up around
the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to describe how dangerous a fire like this is," said
Lynn Young of the U.S. Forest Service. "A fire going this fast and
going through treetops cannot be stopped. It can't be stopped by a
river, it can't be stopped by a subdivision. It's very much out of
control. There's nothing to do but get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   The blaze began in Park County and spread to Teller County, both
south of Denver. Late Sunday, it swept north through Douglas County,
the state's fastest-growing area, and by Monday it had encroached
into Jefferson County, home to Denver's bedroom communities.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze is threatening sprawling subdivisions and small, densely
packed communities in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, as well
as Chatfield Reservoir, Denver's water source.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze, known as the Hayman Fire, was designated the nation's
top firefighting priority. But there are so many serious fires
elsewhere in Colorado that firefighting resources are stretched thin.</TE>
<TE>   Air tankers are being shared between the Hayman Fire and the
10,000-acre Glenwood Springs fire, west of Denver, which destroyed 25
homes. That fire remained out of control Monday, with more than 2,000
people evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   There are about nine fires raging in Colorado, which is having its
worst wildfire season in history. The state released $10 million to
pay for firefighting efforts, which have been draining state coffers
for a month.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Bill Owens announced a statewide ban on open fires and
smoking outdoors. He prohibited the sale and use of fireworks. He
also closed a handful of state parks.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service closed the Pike-San Isabel National Forest, a
regional recreation mecca. A Forest Service spokesman said it was too
risky to keep the forest open because too many people were ignoring
the campfire ban. Officials said the Hayman Fire was started by an
illegal campfire.</TE>
<TE>   As the wildfire moved north, it left rural areas and began to race
toward Denver's southernmost suburbs. Although the fire had
officially destroyed only one structure, officials said that
statistic will rise as surveillance planes are able to get into the
air to assess the damage and as the fire moves into the state's most
populous region.</TE>
<TE>   County sheriffs were making evacuation decisions throughout the
day. The logistics were daunting for a mass evacuation over small
county roads and from mountain towns.</TE>
<TE>   "We have made our entire staff available for this emergency," said
Sgt. Attila Denes of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department. The
county's evacuation plan had never been put to such a test, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've canceled all days off and put people on 12-hour shifts. We
hope we have adequate staffing to get it done. But planning and
reality can be a different thing," Denes said.</TE>
<TE>   In densely populated Jefferson County, the sheriff's office was
poised to evacuate small communities in the foothills west of Denver,
as well as large subdivisions of custom homes to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside Denver, in the Roxborough Park area near Littleton,
14,000 residents were waiting for an evacuation order. Amy Arens, who
was housesitting for her parents, didn't wait for the official word.
Arens took two family dogs to a kennel and loaded the minivan with
family pictures, artwork and important documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Most everyone I know is packing up and heading out," she said of
her neighbors. "It's not a mandatory evacuation, but I'm out of here
too."</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Conifer, home to many who commute to Denver,
residents packed cars and left them in their driveways. Most were
deliberating whether to leave.</TE>
<TE>   During what should have been the dinner rush at Conifer's Green
Valley Grill, there were only two diners. Assistant manager Alexis
Lovejoy anxiously wondered what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "They're evacuating everything south of us but we haven't been
told to leave yet," Lovejoy said. "But there are ashes falling from
the sky. This is making me nervous. I think it's time to think about
leaving."</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Red Cross was so overwhelmed responding to this and
several other major fires in the state that it called for assistance
from its national office. The organization was scrambling to set up
shelters in high school gymnasiums but was frustrated by the fire's
changing path. Several times a shelter was designated, only to be
changed because fire officials feared for its safety.</TE>
<TE>   "Holy cow, we've been moving like crazy to get the shelters open,"
said Matt Bertram of the Rocky Mountain Red Cross. "We're moving into
urban shelters for the first time. I've never seen a fire move this
fast. It's almost unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Fire bosses acknowledged there was little to do in the face of
such a wall of flames and smoke. Two slurry bombers were able to dump
retardant on the blaze, but no firefighters were placed ahead of the
fire and only a few were used to attack its flank.</TE>
<TE>   Local fire departments in towns ahead of the fire were contacted
and told to forgo any effort to battle the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way to make a stand in front of this fire," said
incident commander Rowdy Muir. "You can't save homes; you can't save
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The sheer size of the Hayman Fire has posed problems. It is 20
miles long and seven miles wide and its leading edge has split into
three long fingers. The fire has grown so large that officials are
planning to designate it as two fires today, with command centers on
its north and south.</TE>
<TE>   Gusting winds Monday fanned the blaze, making it unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get a fire started with that kind of wind, there's not
much you can do to stop it," said Tom Wordell, a wildfire analyst
with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, who has
been monitoring the Hayman Fire. "You get very intense flames, very
high flame lengths, and the ability to control that fire exceeds the
capability of firefighting resources."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this report.</TE>

downpours washed out highways and rural roads. More than 100 sections
of roadway were impassable, including this part of Highway 200 near
the hamlet of Ada, where a State Highway Patrol car blocks what's
left of the pavement. The town reportedly has been declared a federal
disaster area at least 18 times in the last 35 years.</CP>

<HD>High Court Backs Forced Confessions</HD>
<DH>Law: Convicted sex offenders can be required to admit past
crimes during rehab.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Convicted sex offenders can be forced to confess to their past crimes
as part of a prison's rehabilitation program despite the
Constitution's ban on forced self-incrimination, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In a 5-4 decision, the court upheld the sex abuse treatment
programs used in Kansas.</LD>
<LD>   The programs require prisoners--some of whom have proclaimed their
innocence--to admit in detail to every sex offense they have
committed during their lives. They are also given polygraph tests to
see if they are telling the truth.</LD>
<TE>   "Acceptance of responsibility is the beginning of rehabilitation,"
said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority. Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas agreed. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concurred.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy pointed to a Justice Department study, which found that
only about 15% of prisoners who complete the sex-abuse treatment are
arrested again for sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Those inmates who refuse to participate in the treatment lose
privileges, such as having a television, and can be sent back to a
maximum-security block. The court described these as minimal
punishments.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas reserves the right to prosecute inmates for new sex crimes
that they admit during the treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Kennedy concluded that the program "does not compel
prisoners to incriminate themselves in violation of the
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   The four dissenters, led by Justice John Paul Stevens, accused the
majority of ignoring "a bedrock constitutional right." The government
cannot punish anyone for refusing to confess, they said, even
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to ask ourselves--what if this is one of those rare
cases in which the jury made a mistake, and [an inmate] is actually
innocent?" Stevens wrote. Voluntary treatment programs pose no such
problem, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer joined his dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for 18 other states joined in support of Kansas, saying
they had similar programs. California was not among them.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling dealt a defeat to Robert Lile, who was convicted of
raping and kidnapping a high school student in 1983. He claimed that
the young woman got in his car of her own accord and that their
encounter was consensual. A jury disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   A few years before he was due to be released, prison officials
ordered him to participate in the Sexual Abuse Treatment Program. He
was required to complete a sexual history form and sign an "Admission
of Responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Lile refused, contending that the requirement violated his rights
under the 5th Amendment, which says: "No person ... shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."</TE>
<TE>   Because Kansas said it would prosecute inmates who revealed past
sex crimes against minors, a federal judge and the U.S. court of
appeals in Denver said the state could not punish Lile for remaining
silent and refusing to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing in McCune vs. Lile, 00-1187, the Supreme Court said
the 5th Amendment need not be interpreted so rigidly.</TE>
<TE>   "If the state had to offer immunity [to uncooperative inmates such
as Lile], the practical effect would be that serial offenders ...
would be given a windfall for past bad conduct," Kennedy said.</TE>

<HD>Alleged Bomb Plotter to Be Held Indefinitely, Pentagon Says</HD>
<DH>Law: The military is relying on two World War II court
decisions to keep Jose Padilla in jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon plans to hold an alleged Al Qaeda bomb plotter
indefinitely without charges despite his U.S. citizenship, citing two
World War II court decisions that allowed Americans to be held as
prisoners of war or charged in military courts.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department is holding Jose Padilla, identified Monday
as the planner of a radioactive "dirty" bomb attack, as an
"intelligence source" for questioning about the Al Qaeda terrorist
network, senior Pentagon spokesman Richard McGraw said.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla is the third U.S. citizen to be arrested as a suspected Al
Qaeda terrorist. He could eventually be prosecuted in a military
court-martial or in U.S. criminal courts, McGraw said.</LD>
<TE>   But for now, by declaring Padilla an "enemy combatant" and
transferring him to the custody of the Defense Department,
authorities maintain they can hold him without charges indefinitely,
and without a lawyer, while interrogating him.</TE>
<TE>   "We have acted with legal authority both under the laws of war and
clear Supreme Court precedent, which establish that the military may
detain a United States citizen who has joined the enemy and has
entered our country to carry out hostile acts," Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was arrested May 8 and held without charge in the custody
of the Justice Department until Monday, when Ashcroft disclosed his
arrest and he was transferred to Pentagon control and sent to a naval
brig in Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The process leaves Padilla, born in Brooklyn, without even the
civil protections enjoyed by accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias
Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent facing trial in
Alexandria, Va. As a legal strategy, "it's beautiful," if
questionable, said Michael F. Noone, a law professor at Catholic
University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It's selective as a legal rationale. It's slick, and it's pushing
the envelope," Noone said. "This means that any U.S. citizen who gets
off a plane in O'Hare [International Airport in Chicago] can be
apprehended by the feds and told 'You're an enemy combatant and
you're going to be tried by court-martial.' "</TE>
<TE>   The legal precedents cited by Ashcroft include a 1942 case in
which a group of Nazi saboteurs--one a U.S. citizen--were tried by a
military tribunal and executed after they arrived via submarine on
U.S. soil. In a 1946 case, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that an Italian-American named Gaetano Territo was legally
captured while wearing an Italian uniform in Sicily and held as a
prisoner of war and court-martialed in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Those precedents allow the Pentagon to continue holding Padilla
for questioning indefinitely and still try him later in a
court-martial or transfer him back to civil authorities for trial,
McGraw said.</TE>
<TE>   Civil Rights vs. Security</TE>
<TE>   The Padilla case is the latest since Sept. 11 to pit civil rights
against the mandate for national security. Hundreds of foreign
citizens have been detained in this country without bail for months
on visa or related violations, while hundreds of enemy soldiers
captured in Afghanistan are being held as "detainees" without the
legal protections afforded prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the tactic used in the Padilla case is found to be
constitutional, critics warn against creating a legal "twilight
status." Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe said he hopes a federal
court will review the case "to make sure that this kind of military
detention does not become a black hole into which American citizens
can be sucked without anyone looking over the commander in chief's
shoulder."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's citizenship means he could not be tried before the
military tribunals established by President Bush to prosecute enemy
fighters from the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But he could be tried at court-martial, before military judges and
with a military attorney, although he likely would be allowed to hire
his own lawyer as an advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Californian John Walker Lindh now faces criminal charges in U.S.
District Court after being held in military custody without a charge
for months.</TE>
<TE>   A third man with U.S. citizenship is being held in a Navy brig in
Norfolk, Va., after being captured in Afghanistan while fighting with
the Taliban. Yasser Esam Hamdi was held with other detainees at the
U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, then moved to Norfolk.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Louisiana but moved to Saudi Arabia as a child.</TE>

<HD>Mother Charged With Killing 2 Ill Sons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRIFFIN, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The two brothers lay side-by-side in a nursing home, their brains so
racked with the same hereditary disease that had killed their father
that they were reduced to incoherent mumbling.</LD>
<LD>   Over the weekend, authorities say, their 63-year-old mother walked
into their room, shot them to death with a small pistol, then calmly
sat on a couch in the lobby and waited to be arrested.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, she bowed her head and apologized as a judge read the
two murder charges against her. "I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry," she
said repeatedly.</LD>
<TE>   Family members say Carol Carr was trying to end the suffering of
her sons, Michael Scott, 42, and Andy Scott, 41. Both were in the
advanced stages of Huntington's disease, which slowly cripples the
brain and the body, the family members said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was depressed all the time. She didn't know what else she
could do for them," said Carr's niece, Debbie Harry. "We were always
worried about what Carol would do. We were afraid she was going to
crack."</TE>
<TE>   Their father, Hoyt Scott, suffered a slow death from Huntington's,
finally succumbing in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Before the two brothers entered SunBridge Care and Rehabilitation
in January, Carr gave her entire life to her sons, family members
say--dressing them, bathing them, helping them go to the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "They were like babies," said Janelle Scott, Carr's sister-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Their only living sibling, 38-year-old James Scott, is in the
early stages of the disease. He said his brothers, riddled with
painful bed sores, had been in and out of nursing homes, were
miserable and could only mumble to each other.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's hearing, Chief Magistrate Rita Cavanaugh tentatively
set a hearing for June 27; Carr did not have a lawyer present.</TE>
<TE>   As she was led to jail, Carr told her relatives, "I love y'all."</TE>

<HD>Father of Kidnapped Girl Gets Routine Polygraph</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Police say testing of parents is not unusual.
Volunteers expand their search to the Utah desert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father of 14-year-old kidnap victim Elizabeth Ann Smart was given
a polygraph exam, authorities said Monday, as the search for the girl
expanded into the desert outside Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   The desert search was conducted by about 50 volunteers using
all-terrain vehicles, an effort applauded by police but directed by
the Smart family.</LD>
<LD>   While the police explore thousands of leads, the Smarts and scores
of volunteers have organized a massive effort that included searchers
on foot and horseback, in planes and SUVs.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to cover every inch of ground, especially in areas
that couldn't necessarily be done by airplanes," said family
spokesman Chris Thomas. "There's no particular reason that we're
looking in the desert, other than that it's an expansion of the
search."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth was reportedly abducted at gunpoint from her bedroom
before dawn Wednesday as the family slept. Police have not identified
a suspect or a motive.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Smart underwent a polygraph examination Sunday, which
police said was a normal investigative procedure. The FBI would not
reveal the results.</TE>
<TE>   Police have praised the Smarts for their assistance and have said
they have no reason to suspect any family member.</TE>
<TE>   "When asked by law enforcement, I fully cooperated because I had
nothing to hide," Smart said Monday in a statement. "We are doing
everything in our power to bring back Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   "We again express our appreciation to law enforcement and all the
gracious volunteers in their unwavering effort on behalf of our
family," said Smart.</TE>
<TE>   A polygraph test is commonly given to eliminate parents as
suspects in kidnapping cases, law enforcement officials and lawyers
say.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said it would be unlikely that Elizabeth's 9-year-old
sister, who shared the bedroom and witnessed the abduction, would
undergo a polygraph. The sister has been unable to provide a complete
description of the intruder, whom she described as a 5-foot, 8-inch
white male wearing a white baseball cap and a light-colored jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a suitable psychological subject in order to take the
test, and a 9-year-old is pushing it because the person is not
emotionally in place yet," said Jack Trimarco, retired head of the
FBI's polygraph unit in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City Police spokesman Sgt. Fred Louis said Monday it was
unclear whether the girl's mother, Lois Smart, would be given a
polygraph.</TE>
<TE>   Louis said about 100 detectives are assigned to the case and that
the number of tips being telephoned to police had waned over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some good leads that investigators are working on but
nothing that is leading us to the immediate whereabouts of
Elizabeth," Louis said.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Smart's brother, Chris, said Monday the family remains
hopeful the kidnapper will release Elizabeth. "We hope that as the
person hears the family pleading, he'll let her go," he said.</TE>

<HD>The Twisted Trajectory of a Chicago Felon</HD>
<DH>Suspect: Padilla, accused of plotting a 'dirty' bomb attack
on U.S. soil, has a history of serious run-ins with the law dating to
his youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG and ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>By the time he moved to sunny Florida, Jose Padilla had a tattoo of
his given name on his right arm and three felony convictions--for
armed robbery, attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery.</LD>
<LD>   He was of Puerto Rican origin, Brooklyn-born but raised in the
dreary Chicago row houses and tenements of the west side neighborhood
of Logan Square. The once-Polish enclave now is heavily populated by
Latinos and plagued by high crime and high school dropout rates.</LD>
<LD>   As a juvenile, he was arrested at least five times. He once was
charged as an accessory to murder, but it is unclear whether he was
convicted. Under Illinois law, court records of underage defendants
are sealed.</LD>
<TE>   Those facts read like the depressingly typical early trajectory of
an inner-city thug--but with an astonishing twist. On Monday, Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft announced that Padilla, now 31 and known as
Abdullah al Muhajir, had been arrested for plotting with Osama bin
Laden's henchmen to detonate a "dirty" bomb that would spread deadly
radioactive material on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   "We have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the
United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   But according to 64-year-old Nelly Ojeda, who lives in the same
Chicago apartment building where the alleged convert to Islamic
extremism grew up: "I don't think that boy did anything.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to always say hi and smiled a lot."</TE>
<TE>   The few other neighbors who remembered Padilla--he went by the
street name "Pucho" back then--said he was a quiet child. But
according to police and detention officials in Illinois, he was in
custody in that state from late 1985 until he turned 18 on Oct. 18,
1988.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, Padilla had moved to a deteriorating
neighborhood in the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., suburb of Lauderhill, east
of the Everglades.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-10, 170-pound man with piercing dark eyes, closely
cropped brown hair and a jaunty mustache found work in 1991 setting
up banquet tables at a Holiday Inn.</TE>
<TE>   But within two weeks, he was in trouble with the law over a road
rage incident.</TE>
<TE>   Road Rage Incident</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 8, according to police reports, Padilla was at the wheel
of a black Toyota Tercel when he pulled a handgun at a busy
intersection. Shortly thereafter, he fired a shot at another car. He
was as close as 20 feet, but missed.</TE>
<TE>   The two occupants of the other vehicle, driven by Victor Lento,
got Padilla's license number. When police showed up at Padilla's
residence, they said he attempted to retrieve something from his
waistband. Patting him down, officers found a .38-caliber silver
revolver hidden under his shirt. He admitted firing a shot during the
traffic altercation, but said he had aimed in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked over and he snarled," Lento testified at Padilla's
trial, claiming the other man had veered into his path as both cars
stopped for a red light. "He was yelling, I was yelling, and ... I
seen a shining gun."</TE>
<TE>   Lento tried to cut Padilla off at a gas station, and said that was
when the young man fired at him out of his car window.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla pleaded guilty to three felony charges of discharging a
firearm from a vehicle, carrying a concealed firearm and aggravated
assault; he was sentenced to 364 days in the Broward County Jail and
a year's probation. At his trial, he became so disgruntled he filed a
motion to fire his court-appointed counsel, Assistant Public Defender
Brian G. Reidy.</TE>
<TE>   "He don't want to listen to nothing I have to say," Padilla
complained to the judge, according to the transcript of court
proceedings. "He don't tell me what he's going to do. He don't
explain to me what he's doing. He makes decisions without me. He
don't ask my family."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Padilla complained that the lawyer had put his
mother under oath without consulting him. Reidy countered that he had
advised his client to be "completely honest and candid" when
answering questions about his prior criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   When the judge asked Padilla exactly what he was seeking, the
defendant replied: "Just want people to be honest with me, tell me
what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Officer Attacked</TE>
<TE>   While in the Broward County Jail, Padilla on Jan. 4, 1992, shoved
a corrections officer twice in the chest. The two men wrestled, until
another officer helped restrain Padilla and the prisoner could be
handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he was a pretty strong guy," Sheriff's Deputy Wilbur
Kegler, who came to his colleague's aid, remembered under oath. "He
was resisting a little bit, and we had to place him on his bunk so we
could apprehend him and handcuff him and everything, because he was
pretty violent."</TE>
<TE>   Even when cuffed, Kegler said, Padilla kept fighting. The
corrections officers summoned all available deputies to assist.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wouldn't listen to anybody," Kegler said. "Any time we
tried to grab him ... he just kept shoving us away. He didn't want to
be touched or listen to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Another deputy who responded to the fracas, Thomas Trawinski,
recalled that he was afraid Padilla's kicks and struggles might send
deputies plunging over the rail outside his jail room.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say he was pretty violent," Trawinski said. "He was
acting in a very threatening manner."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla pleaded guilty on Aug. 5, 1992, to committing battery on a
law enforcement officer and resisting arrest. He was sentenced to 195
days in jail, but given credit for 195 days already served.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sterling Ivey, a spokesman for the Florida Department
of Corrections, Padilla was on probation for a year ending in 1993.
State records cited by Associated Press show he completed a substance
abuse program during that period.</TE>
<TE>   Records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
show that Padilla remained in Florida until at least 1997, and that
he was in frequent violation of traffic rules and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 28, 1994, he was cited for driving without insurance and
failure to use due care. The next year, Padilla was written up for
having an expired registration tag, driving without insurance and
driving without a license.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he was charged with using a canceled license, and in 1997
for speeding and failing to appear for a traffic summons.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For months, U.S. officials have boasted of knocking out Al Qaeda's
command center in Afghanistan and said they were well on their way to
dismantling Osama bin Laden's worldwide terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The Al Qaeda leadership was forced to go on the run, officials
said, its soldiers hard-pressed to launch new attacks. And while
authorities repeatedly sounded warnings, they were the first to
acknowledge they had little, if anything, to go on.</LD>
<LD>   But recently, U.S. officials have received unsettling--and
specific--indications that Al Qaeda has again become a deadly
organization with an intact leadership, a global reach.</LD>
<TE>   That troubling assessment is based on far more than the arrest of
Jose Padilla, also known as Abdullah al Muhajir, a U.S. citizen who
allegedly plotted with senior Al Qaeda leaders to detonate a "dirty"
bomb somewhere in the United States, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   It is based on recently gleaned intelligence information, they
said, including evidence that Al Qaeda has reconstituted a command
structure and found a safe haven for it somewhere in the vast
badlands of northwest Pakistan. Bin Laden, his deputy Ayman
Al-Zawahiri and several other top commanders are all believed to be
alive and hiding somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan; other
operatives such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed are suspected of having
joined the group's top echelon, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   At least parts of that command structure are now slipping into and
out of Afghanistan despite the U.S. presence there, meeting with Al
Qaeda operatives and planning more attacks, officials said in
interviews. The Al Qaeda leadership is also reaching out to
potentially thousands of "sleeper" agents all over the world trained
in terrorist camps in a variety of urban warfare techniques,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The leadership may be on the run, but they're certainly not out
of commission," said one Bush administration official, adding that
although the intelligence information is "hard," authorities haven't
found the specific location of the new Al Qaeda base of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the official said, "The intelligence community
believes that ... they are still meeting and that there are
sanctuaries around the world that are providing them with support.
Think of all the Al Qaeda leaders still at large--it could be any of
them" leading the regrouping effort.</TE>
<TE>   "You can assume, and you should assume, that any number of plots
are still active," added the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. "Who is to say that all the chatter last summer on the
intelligence channels was just about 9/11?.... I can guarantee you
that there are other plots out there."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, in fact, an Al Qaeda spokesman issued a public
declaration, warning Americans to get ready for another attack on the
scale of Sept. 11, or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "What is coming to the Americans will not, by the will of God, be
less than what has come," said Sulaiman Abu Ghaith in a posting on
the Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Neda Web site. "So beware, America. Get
ready. Get prepared. Put on the safety belt."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most troubling, Al Qaeda now appears to be working with
U.S. citizens and other operatives with backgrounds that make it
particularly easy for them to compromise U.S. border security, even
as the United States spends billions to catch suspect foreigners in a
counter-terrorism safety net.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also confirmed that until several weeks before his
arrest, they had never even heard of Padilla, even though his mission
appeared to be well underway. Padilla took the Muslim name Al Muhajir
after a stint in a Florida jail. Padilla, born in New York City,
lived in Chicago and then Florida until about three years ago, when
he began traveling in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said Monday that
Padilla met with "senior Al Qaeda members" this year to discuss plans
to detonate a radioactive dispersal device.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III described those conversations
as "substantial." Authorities also confirmed that one of the Al Qaeda
participants was top Bin Laden lieutenant Abu Zubeida, who spoke with
Padilla in the weeks before his capture March 28 in Faisalabad,
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, according to Wolfowitz, had researched nuclear weapons
and received training in wiring explosives while in Pakistan, before
being instructed to return to the United States to conduct
reconnaissance operations for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the plot had not yet advanced past the discussion
stage, but that they had substantial intelligence to indicate that it
was real and being taken very seriously by the Al Qaeda leadership.
At a news briefing, they would not discuss whether they have
identified any co-conspirators in the United States or elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest provides a blend of reassuring and disquieting news for
a nation roiled by frequent alarms about terrorism risks.</TE>
<TE>   At one level, it shows the beefed-up U.S. counter-terrorism
operation foiling a potential plot before it could go very far--a
notable triumph.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, it shows how much U.S. counter-terrorism
officials still don't know. A senior U.S. intelligence official said
Padilla was under surveillance for several weeks before his arrest on
May 8.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows again how we weren't doing the work on Al Qaeda that we
should have done," said Kenneth Katzman, a terrorism expert at the
Congressional Research Service.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at the Rand Corp., said Al
Qaeda's apparent use of an American such as Padilla also is "very
worrisome."</TE>
<TE>   "There's obvious recognition that the most valuable asset they can
deploy against the United States is an American with a clean
passport," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of the punishing military strikes in Afghanistan in
October, Al Qaeda appeared to have resurfaced, at least in part.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe the terror network helped send British
vagabond Richard Reid on his mission to blow up a packed commercial
jetliner as it flew from Paris to Miami at Christmas, and perhaps
played a role in the abduction and execution of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, terrorists suspected of being affiliated with Al
Qaeda launched two car bomb attacks, at a synagogue in Tunisia and a
tourist hotel in Pakistan, that killed at least 30 people and injured
dozens more.</TE>
<TE>   But the new intelligence marks the first concrete indications that
Al Qaeda's top leadership has been involved in plotting post-Sept. 11
terrorist acts in the United States, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   That intelligence, coupled with the warning from one of Al Qaeda's
own leaders, has U.S. officials more on edge than at any time since
the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Ghaith, a Kuwaiti-born cleric and close aide to Bin Laden, is
considered an official spokesman for the terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   On the Al-Neda Web site, which has in the past carried news and
statements from Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, Ghaith said the network
would continue to strike Americans and Jews, either as "individuals
or institutions," according to a translation published by the
pan-Arab daily newspaper al-Hayat.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still at the beginning of the road. The Americans have not
yet suffered from us what we have suffered from them," said Ghaith,
adding that the United States had killed, directly or indirectly,
thousands of Muslims in Iraq, Palestinian territories, Afghanistan,
Sudan, the Philippines, Bosnia and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "So we have the right to kill 4 million Americans, including 1
million children, displace double that figure and injure and cripple
hundreds of thousands," Ghaith said. "We have the right to fight them
by chemical and biological weapons so that they catch the fatal and
unusual diseases that Muslims have caught due to their [U.S.]
chemical and biological weapons."</TE>

<HD>Disabled's Right to Jobs Narrowed</HD>
<DH>Employment: Supreme Court rules employers may deny impaired
applicants work if the post might threaten their health or safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Employers may reject qualified job applicants because of their
disabilities if the post they seek poses a serious threat to their
health or safety, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in the case of a Los
Angeles-area oil refinery worker.</LD>
<LD>   It has been clear, under the law, that companies can refuse to
hire disabled people for a job where their limitations could pose a
safety risk to others, such as co-workers.</LD>
<LD>   The high court went a step further Monday and said workers can be
turned away if their disabilities represent a threat to themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The 9-0 ruling further narrows the Americans with Disabilities
Act, the 1990 measure that outlawed job discrimination against
qualified workers who had physical or mental impairments.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ban on job bias, employers need not hire someone for a
job that "would endanger his own health, owing to a disability," the
court said.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's decision is the seventh in the past four years to
interpret the job bias portions of this law. All seven have resulted
in victories for employers and defeats for the workers claiming a
disability.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the disabled feared the latest decision could
encourage employers to reject job applicants with all manner of
disabilities, including heart conditions or those with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought Congress had rejected this kind of paternalism when it
passed'' the disabilities act, said Ira Burnim of the Bazelon Center
for Mental Health Law, a disability-rights group.</TE>
<TE>   "This allows the employer to say we know what's best for you,"
said James Esseks, an ACLU lawyer who filed a brief supporting the
oil refinery worker. "Think of an example that seems absurd today. A
company says to a person in a wheelchair, 'You can't work in a
skyscraper because it would be dangerous to you if there was a fire.'
This [ruling] represents a version of that."</TE>
<TE>   But corporate lawyers hailed the decision, saying it would put
safety and common sense first. They cited worst-case examples of
their own, such as the high-rise steelworker who suffers from
vertigo.</TE>
<TE>   "If employers were told they could not consider the [worker's]
risk to self, they would have been in a terrible quandary," said
Stephen M. Shapiro, a Chicago lawyer who represented Chevron USA, the
employer in this case. "They could be faced with hiring people who
they know would die on the job. And they would also be exposed to all
sorts of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The case of Chevron vs. Echazabal, 00-1406, reached the Supreme
Court six years after the oil giant had dismissed Mario Echazabal
from his job at the El Segundo refinery near Los Angeles
International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   He had worked there since 1972 in a series of maintenance jobs for
a private contractor. When he applied for a full-time job with
Chevron, the plant's doctor said he had hepatitis C, a liver
infection. This condition could be aggravated by the toxic chemicals
at the refinery, the company said, and he was let go.</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal sued, alleging he was unfairly discriminated against
because of a disability. He also said his health was good and that he
was capable of doing the job.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Lourdes Baird in Los Angeles sided with
Chevron and threw out his lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, on a 2-1 vote, revived
his claim. Judge Stephen Reinhardt noted that the disabilities law
says employers can refuse to hire people who pose "a direct threat to
the health or safety of others."</TE>
<TE>   It does not say employers can refuse to hire disabled persons
because the job is a threat to their own health.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers joined the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and the National Assn. of Manufacturers in urging the court to
reverse that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Ruling Is Unanimous</TE>
<TE>   Justice David H. Souter, writing the unanimous court decision,
said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces
anti-bias law, has long maintained businesses may reject disabled
applicants for jobs that would be a threat to their own health and
safety.</TE>
<TE>   He added that employers cannot use broad "stereotypes" to reject
disabled applicants. Their decisions must be based on "a reasonable
medical judgment ... of the individual's present ability to safely
perform the essential functions of the job."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling does not necessarily resolve Echazabal's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   While Chevron's doctors said he should not work at the refinery,
he had two medical experts, including a liver specialist at UCLA
Medical Center, who said the workplace would not be dangerous for
him.</TE>
<TE>   A judge or a jury in Los Angeles may have to resolve this factual
dispute. Lawyers for Echazabal say they plan to continue to press his
case.</TE>
<TE>   Echazabal, 56, is working part-time as a school bus driver, said
his lawyer, Larry Minsky of Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   Disability-rights advocates said they were disappointed but not
surprised by Monday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a pretty clear trend in ... employment cases" stemming
from the disabilities act, said Harvard Law School professor Samuel
Bagenstos, who argued the case on behalf of Echazabal. "The court
consistently rules in favor of employers."</TE>
<TE>   When Congress passed the act in 1990, it was signed into law by
then-President George Bush and hailed as a promise of equal treatment
for the tens of millions who had physical or mental disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court has narrowed the reach of the law and
limited its benefits.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, earlier this year the court ruled that workers with
crippling workplace injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome are not
disabled persons entitled to protection under the law.</TE>
<TE>   And last month, the court said that a disabled worker is not
entitled to claim another, less taxing job if it means replacing a
worker with more seniority.</TE>

<HD>Platform Is Added to Space Station</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Astronauts clamped a $254-million work platform to the International
Space Station on Monday, providing a movable bench for the orbiting
outpost's robot arm.</LD>
<LD>   Working from inside the space station, two astronauts used the
58-foot robot arm to put the platform in place on top of a rail car.
A pair of spacewalkers will go back out today to bolt it down and
wire it up.</LD>
<LD>   The arm and its new mobile base were contributed by Canada.</LD>
<TE>   "Canada is grateful and proud," Mission Control radioed once the
job was accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   The rail car and its 44-foot stretch of track were delivered to
the space station during the last shuttle visit, in April. The
car-and-track combination will be used to extend the reach of the
robot arm during construction of the space station.</TE>
<TE>   Space shuttle Endeavour astronauts Franklin Chang-Diaz and
Philippe Perrin were to conduct today's spacewalk. They planned to
make one more spacewalk Thursday to replace a joint in the robot arm
that kept seizing up.</TE>
<TE>   Perrin, a French astronaut, asked Mission Control for help in
alleviating the foot pain he experienced during Sunday's spacewalk.
He said the problem is with the metal strips in the heels of his
boots.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Control advised Perrin to wrap his sore heels to relieve
the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour delivered a new three-member crew to the space station
and is bringing home the three men who lived there for the last six
months.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, all 10 space travelers gathered in the space
station laboratory for a change-of-command ceremony. But half a
minute into the affair, a smoke alarm went off in one of the Russian
sections of the space station.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a false alarm, and the crew pulled off the
ceremony five hours later without incident.</TE>

<DL>MESQUITE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A sport-utility vehicle smashed into a flatbed tractor-trailer parked
on the shoulder of an interstate Monday, killing a woman and five of
her children, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives said the family left a reunion in Beaumont, about 230

<HD>U.S. Citizen Accused of Planning an Attack Using a 'Dirty'
Bomb</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Authorities say the suspect talked with Al Qaeda
about detonating a radioactive device. He is in military custody
indefinitely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU, BOB DROGIN and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A onetime Chicago gang member who turned to Islam in a Florida jail
allegedly plotted with senior Al Qaeda operatives to detonate a
radioactive bomb on American soil, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Padilla, 31, who also goes by the name Abdullah al Muhajir,
was in the early stages of planning an attack in the United States
when he was quietly apprehended last month at Chicago O'Hare
International Airport after flying from Zurich, Switzerland. He had
been under surveillance for several weeks before his arrest, law
enforcement sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla met with one of Osama bin Laden's top chieftains--Abu
Zubeida--and other senior leaders this year to plot an attack that
could spew massive amounts of radioactive waste, intelligence
officials said. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft described it as "an
unfolding terrorist attack."</LD>
<TE>   The conspiracy outlined by Ashcroft provides evidence that Zubeida
has become an important source of detailed information about Al Qaeda
activities since his arrest in Pakistan in late March.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla had more than $10,000 in cash on him at the time of his
arrest--money that he appears to have traveled to Switzerland from
Pakistan to collect for his mission, the sources said. Al Qaeda
operatives have often used wire transfers to finance their
operations, but Padilla's use of cash may indicate that U.S.
authorities have succeeded in shutting down traditional money
pipelines and forcing operatives to use riskier measures, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are uncertain about Padilla's target. "He had
indicated some knowledge of the Washington, D.C., area, but I want to
emphasize ... there was not an actual plan. We stopped this man in
the initial planning stages," Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's discussions with Al Qaeda leaders about detonating a
"dirty" bomb were "substantial," FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a key meeting in March with senior Al Qaeda operatives in
Karachi, Pakistan, Padilla "discussed not only this proposed dirty
bomb but other possible attacks on the United States, including
blowing up hotels and gas stations," a U.S. intelligence official
said. Padilla is now in military custody.</TE>
<TE>   A so-called dirty bomb is a conventional explosive encased in
radioactive waste, capable of scattering hazardous debris over
hundreds of yards. The allegations against Padilla appear to confirm
authorities' long-held fears that Al Qaeda would seek to employ such
a devastating weapon, and his arrest also points up the often
unexplored threat posed by U.S. citizens who may be secretly aligned
with extremist groups, terrorism experts said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Citizens Recruited</TE>
<TE>   While U.S. authorities have taken aggressive steps since Sept. 11
to guard against foreign visa holders who may be terrorists, the
allegations against Padilla signal that Al Qaeda operatives are "very
much aware" that U.S. citizens may be apt to draw less suspicion at
the borders, said Harry "Skip" Brandon, former head of intelligence
at the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a matter of real concern, and we may have to expand our
focus," Brandon said. "I don't know how many U.S. citizens they can
find to help, but it certainly seems as if they're trying."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ashcroft: "Al Qaeda officials knew that as a U.S. citizen,
holding a valid U.S. passport, [Padilla] would be able to travel
freely in the United States without drawing attention to himself."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), in Chicago on Monday to tour
the city's emergency call center, said the arrest was a reminder that
the country's campaign against terrorism is far from over. "The enemy
is out there. The enemy is working and plotting and planning to
strike again."</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, born in Brooklyn of Puerto Rican descent, is the third
U.S. citizen known to be in American custody because of overseas ties
to Al Qaeda or the network's Taliban protectors.</TE>
<TE>   John Walker Lindh is facing trial in Virginia on charges that he
conspired to murder Americans in fighting for the Taliban. Another
Taliban fighter, Yasser Esam Hamdi, was captured in Afghanistan and
flown to the United States in April after records indicated he was
born in Louisiana and held dual U.S.-Saudi citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lindh and Hamdi fought with the Taliban, no evidence has
emerged to suggest that either man was plotting an attack on U.S.
soil.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, in contrast, was an American trained by Al Qaeda to
attack his home country, authorities alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "He researched nuclear weapons and received training in explosives
wiring while in Pakistan, and he was instructed to return to the
United States to conduct reconnaissance operations for Al Qaeda,"
Wolfowitz told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's arrest thrusts him into the national spotlight after a
troubled life that has seen him in and out of jail for much of the
last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Moving from Brooklyn to Chicago with his family around age 5 in
1975, he was raised in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood on the
city's west side. The area, plagued by high crime and high dropout
rates, is home to many of the city's Latino gangs, and Padilla fell
into the gang life in his teenage years, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   As a juvenile, Padilla was arrested at least five times,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, he was charged as an accessory to murder but,
because Illinois juvenile records are sealed, it was unclear Monday
whether he was convicted in that case. Public records show that at
15, he was convicted on three felony charges: armed robbery,
attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery. He was in custody in
Illinois from late 1985 until mid-1988.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla moved to a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., but was soon
in trouble with the law again. In a traffic altercation in October
1991, he pulled a gun and fired a shot at another car and was
incarcerated for nearly a year, getting into more trouble behind bars
for shoving a corrections officer.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla told government interrogators after his arrest in Chicago
that he turned to Islam while incarcerated in the Broward County Jail
and ultimately took his Islamic name.</TE>
<TE>   "He met some people in jail who made him think about Islam, he
converted to Islam, and he got really serious when he got
out--serious about his religious pursuit," according to a law
enforcement official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   After his release from jail in 1992, Padilla continued to get into
occasional scrapes with the law until he left Florida in 1998 for
overseas, authorities said. He is believed to have lived and traveled
in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere in the Middle East, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   His contacts with Al Qaeda dated to at least last year, when he
had several meetings with senior operatives, Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said Padilla first met Zubeida late last
year in the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost and traveled with him.
Zubeida then sent Padilla to Pakistan for training in wiring and set
up further meetings to plot the dirty bomb attacks. Padilla also
researched dirty bombs at an Al Qaeda site in Lahore in eastern
Pakistan, the intelligence officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials said it is not known whether Padilla
trained in Al Qaeda's terrorist camps, the tie that binds many
suspected Al Qaeda operatives around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   But a Justice Department official who asked not to be identified
said: "He's considered an Al Qaeda operative."</TE>
<TE>   It was the capture of Zubeida in March that led U.S. investigators
to Padilla, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla "was identified as someone who was interested in lighting
off a dirty bomb. [Zubeida] gave him up," according to a Bush
administration official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida did not name the man, according to a senior intelligence
official, but "he provided information that allowed us to piece
together other information to figure out who he was talking about" in
late April.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence official said the other information came from
other Al Qaeda officials in U.S. custody as well as from various
documents recovered in Afghanistan and elsewhere that outline Al
Qaeda's apparent interest in building and using a radioactive bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "We had separate information from other sources, both human and
documentary, that supported the notion that there was such a guy,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We started trying to figure out who he was and eventually did,"
the official added. "Then we tried to figure out where he was. Then
we determined he was planning on coming to the U.S. So he was under
surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   Arrested in Chicago</TE>
<TE>   That surveillance spanned several weeks, as Padilla traveled from
Pakistan to Zurich, then to Egypt and back to Zurich.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were able to identify a flight they believed Padilla
was planning to take from Zurich to Chicago arriving on May 8. FBI
agents were on board the flight, but they did not take him into
custody until he had gotten off the plane and gone through
customs--declaring only $8,000 of the $10,526 in cash that he had on
him.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was in Justice Department custody for more than a month as
a material witness--a status that allowed his indefinite detention.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, at the recommendation of the Justice Department and the
Pentagon, President Bush declared Padilla an "enemy combatant" and
authorized his transfer to military custody.</TE>
<TE>   After weeks of attacks on the intelligence community over missed
warning signs in the weeks before Sept. 11, Bush administration
officials said Padilla's arrest marked a clear success.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the arrest came because of "the vigilance of our
intelligence gathering and law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   And FBI director Mueller, whose agency has been feuding with the
CIA over Sept. 11 failings, made sure to thank his counterparts for
their critical assistance in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Our principal priority is preventing future terrorist attacks,"
he said. "And this instance is an example of prevention."</TE>

Washington, John-Thor Dahlburg in Florida and Eric Slater in Chicago

<HD>Southland Afghans Elect 10 for National Council</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After one failed election, many controversies and months of planning,
Southern California Afghans finally elected 10 area
representatives--a group diverse in age, gender, ethnic background
and political ideology--who will be part of a national 40-member
council of Afghan Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The council's primary goals will be to provide a unified voice to
government leaders, a liaison between Afghan Americans and the Afghan
government, assist with their homeland's reconstruction and promote
cultural awareness.</LD>
<LD>   "This was our first test of democracy," Malibu resident Zohra
Yusuf Daoud, a former Miss Afghanistan and newly elected
representative, said of the elections. "The most important thing is
that we got together. This council is a combination of Pashtun,
Tajik, different languages, different political agendas. We need to
show to the people of the community that we can work together."</LD>
<TE>   The weekend election took place in three Southern California
locations. About 975 people voted, which was less than expected, but
organizers said they were pleased voting took place without a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Things went very well, very democratically," said Irvine resident
Mir Saifullah Kazim, a member of the Election Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The last time an election was held, on Jan. 27, more than 1,000
people showed up at a banquet hall in Laguna Hills. Police were
called in to help clear the overcrowded hall and many people
complained that the election process was unfair.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the criticism, local Afghans formed an Election
Commission to plan subsequent elections, a nominating process and
candidate guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Afghan Americans now hope to join their
counterparts from Northern California, New York and the Washington,
D.C., area to form a national organization. No formal name has been
chosen for this group.</TE>
<TE>   Kazim said the process has been a learning experience:</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite interesting. I've never experienced anything like
this before. It's like bringing a child into the world without a
mother."</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Afghans elected over the weekend are
Hassan Amiry of Anaheim; Zohra Yusuf Daoud of Malibu; Sayed
Khalilollah Hashemeyan of Montclair; Assadullah Manely of Irvine;
Abdul Ahad Mansoori of Burbank; Kabir Mohmand of Santa Ana; Yasin
Mohammad Noorzay of Reseda; Adbul Qayum Qargha of San Diego; Flouran
Wali of San Diego; and Nasim Yusuf of Garden Grove.</TE>

<HD>Coyote Traps to Be Allowed in 'Problem' Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission decided Monday to
maintain the city's general ban on coyote trapping but added an
exception that allows trapping if an animal has acted aggressively
toward humans.</LD>
<LD>   City policy had barred animal control officers from trapping
coyotes unless the animals were sick, injured or had bitten someone
and had to be tested for rabies.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy, effective immediately, will allow animal control
officers to also set traps for coyotes that, despite the department's
and residents' best efforts to deter them, have attacked people or
are believed likely to attack.</LD>
<TE>   "This provides us the capability to respond to incidences where
there really is a problem," said Jerry Greenwalt, general manager of
the city Department of Animal Regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's decision Monday came after a city staff report
recommended continuing the ban on trapping. The report also
recommended hiring two additional animal control officers to teach
homeowners how to dissuade coyotes from prowling around their
properties.</TE>
<TE>   The two additional officers will help an existing education
program that has been understaffed, Greenwalt said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers, who will be reassigned from other departments within
animal control, will respond to complaints about coyotes and teach
residents how to discourage the animals from loitering or attacking.</TE>
<TE>   Among the advice they will offer will be to take pets in at night
and to eliminate outdoor pet dishes and uncovered garbage cans. The
officers also will try to track some coyotes and determine their
behaviors.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the decision to leave a trap would only come
after an animal control officer has followed these steps and
contacted the animal control general manager.</TE>
<TE>   The animal control department would then work with the state Fish
and Game Department and the county Department of Agriculture to
determine if a trap should be set, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really the very, very last thing that we'll even consider,"
Greenwalt said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents who oppose the trapping, including members of a
group called Citizens for a Humane Los Angeles, said the city's
modified policy could be abused.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bell, a member of the group, said he hopes animal control
officers won't set a trap for every coyote that residents spot.</TE>
<TE>   "That to me is not a reason to trap anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwalt said his goal is not to trap every coyote--just those
that the city considers a genuine threat to humans.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not absolutely assured we will catch the animal that is
the biggest pest," he said. "But we believe by observation and
working with the community, if there is a problem animal, we will be
successful."</TE>

<HD>Suspect Arrested in '93 Killing of Woman</HD>
<DH>Slaying: Officials say DNA evidence from the Torrance crime
scene was held for more than eight years before a match was made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A suspect has been arrested in the killing of a Torrance woman after
DNA evidence linked him to the 1993 crime, sheriff's officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Josephine Tan was found in bushes near a freeway
overpass, but police had no leads in the case until spring, when DNA
from Christopher Goree, 26, was matched to evidence on her body.</LD>
<LD>   Goree, who was 17 at the time and lived a few blocks from the
scene of the crime, was arrested Wednesday and booked on suspicion of
murder. He is being held without bail.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a feeling of satisfaction that the case is solved," said
sheriff's Det. Gerald Biehn, the original investigator. "And it's
also a feeling of bewilderment as to why this crime occurred in the
first place."</TE>
<TE>   On the day she was killed, Biehn said, Tan was in the process of
moving from her brother's home in Carson into an apartment with a
friend in an unincorporated area of Torrance. The 41-year-old, who
worked for a nutrition company in the South Bay, did not drive a car,
which meant she had to make multiple trips on foot, carrying her few
possessions on her back.</TE>
<TE>   She trudged back and forth over a footbridge that crosses the
Harbor Freeway, and as night fell, she told her friend that she was
going back to her brother's for one more load. She was never seen
alive again, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, children walking home from elementary school
over the footbridge glimpsed what they thought was a mannequin lying
on an embankment on the west side of the freeway, Biehn said.</TE>
<TE>   They went down for a better look and discovered Tan's body. Near
it were clothes and other possessions she had been carrying. Biehn
declined to say how she was killed, but said the attack was brutal
and that Tan probably had been raped. If she screamed, he said, no
one would have heard her over the freeway traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea who the suspect was," Biehn said. "You just really
felt for the victim. You knew she had been through a horrendous
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Still, detectives were unable to turn up anything. Their only
hope, Biehn said, was DNA. A sample was developed from evidence
collected at the crime scene, and entered into the state's DNA bank.</TE>
<TE>   It sat there without a match for eight and a half years.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in November 2001, Goree was convicted of sexually assaulting
two minors. As a condition of his sentence, he was required to submit
a DNA sample. It matched evidence taken from Tan's body, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Biehn said that because Goree was a minor when Tan died, officials
will hold a hearing to decide whether to try him as a juvenile or as
an adult.</TE>

<HD>Courthouse Named for the Late Justice Mosk</HD>

<LD>The main civil courthouse at 1st and Hill streets in downtown Los
Angeles was renamed for the late California Supreme Court Justice
Stanley Mosk on Monday in a ceremony at the Music Center attended by
leading political and judicial officials.</LD>
<LD>   State Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald George, Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn and the chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, Zev Yaroslavsky, were among the speakers.</LD>
<LD>   Mosk, the longest-serving member of the state Supreme Court, also
served 16 years on the Los Angeles Superior Court and six years as
attorney general of California. He died last year at 88 of a heart
attack, on the day he was to retire from nearly 37 years on the high
court.</LD>
<TE>   George, noting that a majority of the current state Supreme Court
justices were present at Monday's ceremonies, said that renaming the
courthouse was "a fitting tribute" to a leader for civil rights. The
name should inspire judges and lawyers who practice there "to live up
to the name of the building," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he was pleased that in the long block between 1st and
Temple streets along Hill Street, the County Hall of Administration
is named for his father, the late Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, and the
courthouse opposite for Mosk. Both men, he said, "bettered justice,
fought for the little guy, and both were great Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Mosk's son, Richard M. Mosk, a newly appointed state Court of
Appeal justice, recalled that his father loved being a Superior Court
judge, beginning at age 30 in 1942, and later presiding over
proceedings involving actor Charlie Chaplin and the divorce case of
Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe.</TE>

<LD>Seventy-something Lyle Stephen recently achieved a career highlight
for a background actor (or extra, as the position used to be called):
Director Steven Spielberg spoke to him.</LD>
<LD>   During the filming of a barroom scene in his new movie, "Catch Me
if You Can," Spielberg stopped the action and told Stephen: "Give me
a beat." The idea was that the camera would focus on Stephen as he
paused to watch one of the stars come through the door. "The others
[background actors] were so jealous," said Adrienne Omansky, who
teaches a city-sponsored acting workshop for senior citizens
(information: (310) 559-9677), many of whom land jobs as extras.
Stephen is one of her students.</LD>
<LD>   The attention from Spielberg made up for the unsuccessful audition
that Stephen had for a role in the HBO series "Six Feet Under"--as a
corpse.</LD>

<TE>   Valley History 101: After setting me straight about all the movies
linked to the community, the Web site resedaweb.blogspot.com now has
a feature on pop songs containing a local reference.</TE>
<TE>   In the Frank Zappa song "Dummy Up," for instance, an un-hip
character is asked: "Where you been livin'? Reseda?" (Zappa, by the
way, attended Antelope Valley High.) Then, of course, there's the
lyric by Tom Petty in "Free Fallin": "It's a long day living in
Reseda/There's a freeway running through the yard." In case you
haven't driven out that way lately, the Reseda Web site says,
"There's still no freeway nearby."</TE>

when told it wasn't free to rent, he said. The movie's title: "Steal

<LD>A wildfire that destroyed nine homes and charred more than 23,400
acres in northern Los Angeles County over six days was contained late
Monday, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura County, a nearly 21,300-acre fire continued to burn,
but officials hoped that cooler temperatures and high humidity would
help them bring it under control by Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   The cost of fighting the Los Angeles County fire was estimated at
more than $6.4 million and could reach $9.4 million, according to
U.S. Forest Service and Los Angeles County fire officials.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities believe a spark from welding equipment at a
construction site on Copper Hill Road in San Francisquito Canyon
touched off the flames Wednesday. Fueled by thick brush and
triple-digit temperatures, the fire scorched 40-year-old scrub growth
in wilderness areas before bearing down on homes and numerous
outbuildings.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities called for evacuations of more than 1,000 residents in
Green Valley, Warm Springs and Drinkwater Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of like fighting a flow of gasoline," Los Angeles
County Fire Capt. Brian Jordan said. "Our engines can only hold 500
gallons of water and it was very difficult to make progress in
terrain that was 90% inaccessible. The key elements for us in
situations like that are the bulldozers and helicopters."</TE>
<TE>   Pushed by 25 mph gusts, the fire advanced as much as five miles a
day, prompting residents in the Leona Valley, Lake Hughes and Lake
Elizabeth areas to prepare to make a quick exit.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 firefighters responded to the blaze, which swept
northward from Saugus. In addition to the nine homes, 17 outbuildings
were damaged or destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Fire crews were aided by cooler weekend temperatures and increased
humidity from coastal fog that slowed the inferno. By Saturday
evening, residents clogged canyon roads leading to Green Valley after
authorities allowed them to return home.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials declared the fire contained by 6 p.m. Monday,
dozens of firefighters remained on standby.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the favorable weather conditions led fire
officials to predict containment of the wildfire in Los Padres
National Forest by Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of firefighters were released from duty Monday and crews
began disassembling large tents at their Soule Park base camp.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has charred acres of dry pine trees and thick chaparral
along steep ridges and low valleys in the Sespe Wilderness. Although
the cause of the wildfire has not been determined, sources familiar
with the investigation have said it was probably ignited by sparks
from gunshots fired at a van parked in tall grass behind a restaurant
north of Ojai on California 33.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Monday that since the fire started June 1, it has
cost federal, state and county agencies more than $11.5 million.
Several roads and recreation areas remain closed.</TE>

<HD>Internet Cafes Face Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Safety: After shooting death, officials in Garden Grove say
they'll step up enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the weekend murder of a 14-year-old boy who had visited a local
Internet cafe, Garden Grove officials said Monday they will step up
regulation of such businesses and consider further restricting their
operation.</LD>
<LD>   Police also said they would patrol the cyber cafes more carefully.</LD>
<LD>   "We will put some teeth into our ordinance," said Garden Grove
Mayor Bruce Broadwater, who met with council members Sunday in an
emergency session to discuss the issue. "We are going to be very,
very tough" on cyber cafes.</LD>
<TE>   The cafes, also called PC rooms, have grown in popularity across
the country, especially with young people, who play computer games
and surf the Internet for hours.</TE>
<TE>   But officials in Garden Grove and elsewhere say the establishments
also attract violence.</TE>
<TE>   Early Saturday morning, Edward Fernandez, whom relatives described
as an average boy who loved sports, was gunned down near his home
after he was apparently followed from I.C.E. Internet Cafe on
Brookhurst Street.</TE>
<TE>   In December, a 20-year-old was stabbed to death outside another
Garden Grove Internet cafe.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council passed an ordinance in January that restricted
hours of operation and put a moratorium on new cyber cafes. The city
has about 20.</TE>
<TE>   Cyber cafes must close by 2 a.m., and, among other things, install
security cameras to monitor customers, the ordinance says. No minors
are allowed during school hours, past 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays
and past 8 p.m. on other days. The city also has a 10 p.m. curfew for
minors.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Edward and some friends were at I.C.E. past curfew
time. The cafe's manager and part owner, Quang Nguyen, said the boys
had been there earlier in the evening but left before 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   He said he does not allow minors after hours and that he told
Edward and his friends when they returned shortly before midnight
that they had to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Edward and the friends exchanged dirty looks with the
passengers in a black car outside I.C.E. The car followed Edward and
three friends who had taken a cab.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said a passenger from the black car shot Edward several
times as he was preparing to pay the cab driver.</TE>
<TE>   Police are still searching for the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   I.C.E. has a security video system, but when detectives asked for
the tapes from late Friday, Nguyen was unable to provide them. City
officials said I.C.E. will be fined for that violation and for
allowing minors in the business past 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen said Monday the lack of tape was an oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a mistake on our part," he said, saying the cafe uses
its security cameras sporadically. "There were a lot of things going
on that night."</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Nguyen said, suspected gang members were
loitering in front of his cafe about 11 p.m. He called police, but
when they arrived, the young men left. Nguyen said police found no
minors in his cafe, which has signs warning youngsters about the time
restrictions. More regulation, he said, is not the solution.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid happened to be here," Nguyen said of Edward. "He could
have been anywhere else. He could have been coming back from the
movies and kids who didn't like him would have followed him."</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see this as a fluke anymore," he said referring to the
two killings associated with cyber cafes.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council next week will consider further curtailing hours
of operation for Internet cafes and creating a task force to study
ways to enforce the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot post an officer on every cafe," police Sgt. Scott
Hamilton said. "The kids are smart. They know which managers are
lax."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hamilton said his department will increase patrols around
cyber cafes.</TE>

<DH>Safety: Dry conditions prompt a move by a Ventura County
supervisor to ban roadside sales in Fillmore.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a 21,300-acre wildfire still burning in Los Padres National
Forest, Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn called Monday for a
meeting with the county fire chief to discuss banning the sale of
Fourth of July fireworks. "It's very dry this year; we're way down on
our rainfall," Flynn said. "It would be a horrible thing to sell
fireworks when we're burning up as it is."</LD>
<LD>   Fillmore is the only city in the county that allows the sale of
so-called safe-and-sane fireworks, which do not explode, dart across
the ground or lift into the air. Although the sale of such fireworks
is permitted by state law, Flynn said it is county land that is most
prone to wildfires.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, at least nine fires throughout the county have
been ignited by fireworks, with the largest burning 4,300 acres in
the Ojai Valley in 1999. Firefighting costs have totaled more than
$5.6 million.</LD>
<TE>   Though most of the fires were started by illegal fireworks, Flynn
said that all roadside sales should be banned. Because the law leaves
the county little or no authority to regulate fireworks sales, it
comes down to politics, he said. Fillmore officials for years have
refused to ban sales.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a change in state law, there may be little the county can
do to prevent fireworks sales in Fillmore, but Flynn hopes, in light
of this year's dangerous fire conditions, to bring political pressure
on Fillmore city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a political issue, but when it becomes a political
[versus] safety issue, we have to go on the safety side," Flynn said.
"We should not allow fireworks to be sold in Ventura County. To sell
them is just asking for problems."</TE>
<TE>   Brush fires have consumed 45,000 acres in Ventura and Los Angeles
counties this month alone. Other wildfires have scorched 11,000 acres
in the region since the beginning of May, with firefighting costs
estimated at $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California blazes are among a wave of wildfires sweeping
across the drought-stricken West, including areas in New Mexico, Utah
and Colorado, where nine fires have engulfed huge swaths of land.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens on Monday banned the sale of all
fireworks. Only public Fourth of July events run by professionals
will be permitted there this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gov. Gray Davis has not called for a similar ban, the
wildfires and dry conditions here have reignited debate over whether
fireworks sales are appropriate. Meteorologists say rain is unlikely
for at least five months.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, 229 cities allow the sale of fireworks,
including 38 in Los Angeles County and five in Orange County. But
many fireworks are sold through civic organizations, which use the
proceeds for philanthropic programs.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to ban the sale of fireworks, every Little League
team, soccer team and all the churches would be coming out of the
woodwork after us," said Garden Grove Mayor Bruce Broadwater. Ventura
County Supervisor Kathy Long, whose district includes Fillmore, said
she is sensitive to the needs of the 25 local nonprofits that rely on
fireworks sales. They include Rotary clubs, high school booster
organizations and the Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Santa Clara Valley,
which usually raise $50,000 or more each.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren said the department has had little
problem with state-approved fireworks sold in his city. Prohibiting
sales won't keep fireworks out of the county as long as residents can
buy them elsewhere, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state fire marshal, he said, believes that banning approved
fireworks would only encourage smuggling of illegal types--such as
firecrackers, Roman candles, M-80s and cherry bombs--from Mexico,
Nevada and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Revell, spokesman for Fullerton-based American Promotional
Events Inc., the largest wholesaler of state-approved fireworks, said
most fires are caused by improper use of illegal fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an element of common sense that relates to
anything with a flame," he said. "That doesn't mean you make it
illegal."</TE>

<HD>Un-Bear-able Loss for 'Army'</HD>
<DH>Golf: Forty years ago this month, Jack Nicklaus beat Arnold
Palmer, and his legion of fans, in a playoff at the U.S. Open to win
his first major.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Nicklaus first saw Arnold Palmer play golf in 1954, first played
against him in 1958 and first challenged him for a major title in
1960.</LD>
<LD>   But it was in the 1962 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club outside
Pittsburgh, 40 years ago this month, in Palmer's backyard and on his
back nine, that the 22-year-old rookie Nicklaus began nudging Palmer
off golf's throne.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine the gall of that kid Jack, wielding his crooked stick
against Arnie's Army.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer's bond with western Pennsylvania had been forged almost as
tungsten steel. He grew up in Latrobe, 40 miles east of Pittsburgh.
Palmer's father, Pap, tended the grounds at Latrobe Country Club, and
it was there that Arnie swatted buckets of balls with a swing so
cork-screwy it would later give teaching pros the willies.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont '62 was a homecoming, and Palmer swaggered like John Wayne
toward it. Palmer was a driver in a bag of tour-playing wedges, an
icon with Grand Slam notions in the wake of his third Masters title
in April.</TE>
<TE>   There was not a more transcendent figure in sports than
Palmer--talented, tan, taut and only 32--no one who better
capitalized on his charisma at a time when 90% of American households
received the gift of television; all those electromagnetic waves
god-knows-how reconvening into our Kennedy-presidency living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to capture in words the magnitude of Arnold
Palmer in golf at that time," Nicklaus writes in "Jack Nicklaus: My
Story." "He was not only the game's undisputed king, but the
emperor-in-chief of contemporary American sports heroes."</TE>
<TE>   The Open at Oakmont was supposed to be a coronation, not a coup
d'etat. Palmer fans were rabid to the point of salivation and
different, maybe the first in golf who didn't applaud politely during
play and extend pinkies at clubhouse tea socials.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer followers were beer and bratwurst types--Cleveland Brown
fans minus the dog biscuits--and in no mood to accommodate an unkempt
kid from Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie's Army was out in force at Oakmont and in for a shock.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus?</TE>
<TE>   He was a crew-cut blond who could have benefited from charm school
and sunscreen. His body type leaned toward early Bob's Big Boy and he
dressed as if Ray Charles had picked out his clothes--hit the road
like that, Jack?</TE>
<TE>   "Always friendly," author Dan Jenkins, who covered the 1962 Open,
recalls of Nicklaus, "but my god he was unsightly."</TE>
<TE>   A black hat to Palmer's white?</TE>
<TE>   "Not among the press," Jenkins says, "but he was among fans. They
wanted Arnold to win every damn week."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer knew Nicklaus was rising, sure as the sun. He even made a
mental notation when the two first played together in a 1958
exhibition--take flier on this guy.</TE>
<TE>   As a 20-year-old amateur, Nicklaus had nearly toppled Palmer at
Cherry Hills in 1960, before Palmer staged his famous charge to
salvage what turned out to be his only U.S. Open title.</TE>
<TE>   Yet few thought Palmer was susceptible at Oakmont, although one
man had a hunch: Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd better watch the fat boy," Palmer told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Fat chance, right?</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus turned pro in late 1961 and went winless in his first 16
PGA Tour events. In his debut at the Los Angeles Open, Nicklaus
finished 50th and took home a whopping $33.33. A few months into his
career, Nicklaus wondered if he would ever win, asking himself,
"When, oh when, is it going to happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont was the happening.</TE>
<TE>   Jack rode in on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and knocked golf on its
grass, stunning Palmer in a playoff and changing golf's face from
chiseled to cherubic.</TE>
<TE>   "That tournament was a turning point for both men," John Feinstein
writes in his book, "The Majors." "It was a launching pad for
Nicklaus and the beginning of the end for Palmer as a dominant
player."</TE>
<TE>   Or so went the myth.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the truth has more nuances.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Bowden, who has written 11 books about Nicklaus, knows better
than most.</TE>
<TE>   "The baton wasn't passed in '62, but there was a sign it was going
to be," Bowden says. "It was the beginning of the rivalry. It
certainly wasn't the end of Arnold."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Palmer won two of his seven major titles after that 1962
defeat by Nicklaus. Palmer rebounded from Oakmont to take the 1962
British Open at Troon by six shots and earned his fourth Masters'
green jacket in 1964, another six-shot victory.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, not Nicklaus, was named PGA player of the year in 1962,
and Palmer won the money title in '62 and 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's two post-Oakmont major victories rank as his most
dominating and satisfying accomplishments. He remained a factor in
major events through 1970. Palmer lost heart-wrenching U.S. Open
playoffs to Julius Boros in 1963 and Billy Casper in 1966--who would
ever forget Palmer's final-round collapse at San Francisco's Olympic
Club?--and finished second to Nicklaus at Baltusrol in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer also finished second in the PGA Championship three times,
in 1964, '68 and 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 1962 is too soon to have him past his peak," Doc Giffin,
the PGA's publicity director in 1962 who later went to work for
Palmer, says. "Nicklaus was a clear challenger to him and it became
evident that year, no question, but Arnold didn't just fade out of
the picture."</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, "A Golfer's Life," Palmer sensed his crown
slipping as he was helping Nicklaus into the green jacket after the
1963 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "I was suddenly staring at the future and my greatest rival in the
game," Palmer recounts. "It was an emotional moment, admittedly
bittersweet for me. Jack Nicklaus had come of age, and professional
golf would never be the same. You could almost feel that in the air."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus would become golf's greatest champion, winning 18 major
championships to Palmer's seven.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie's Retreat</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont '62 was more of a harbinger, a dead-solid-perfect warning
shot across Palmer's bow.</TE>
<TE>   It was a magnificent first professional victory for Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "He beat the king," Bowden says. "What more can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, though, might have chalked it up as just another
opportunity lost.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont provided the backdrop and played host to men of equal
skill but vastly disparate personalities and playing styles.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was emotive and entertaining and played as though he had a
plane to catch. He thrilled and incensed fans with his risk-taking.
Nicklaus was introspective and methodical, a Jack who jacked the ball
a mile, yet a man who preferred the paleontologist's approach of
fine-tooth combing.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was reprimanded at times for slow play; Palmer had less
complicated swing thoughts--hit ball hard, find ball, hit ball hard
again.</TE>
<TE>   That Palmer and Nicklaus were paired together for the first two
rounds of the 1962 Open only added to the drama.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie's Army was especially unruly that week, heckling Nicklaus
the way American galleries today needle Colin Montgomerie.</TE>
<TE>   "They were hometown fans," Giffin remembers. "It was like going to
a football game at Ohio State. There was some unfair rooting against
Jack, and Arnold always admired Jack for being able to handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Handle it?</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus claims to have never heard any of it.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't believe him when he says that, but I do,"
Bowden says. "He has an ability to focus that I've never seen in any
player. Ben Hogan was the same, but I didn't see that much of Hogan's
career. But I saw a lot of Jack. He could bear down and wipe
everything else aside. He thinks about one thing at a time."</TE>
<TE>   Until 1965, the U.S. Open concluded with two Saturday rounds.</TE>
<TE>   After the morning 18 in 1962, Palmer shared the lead at 212 with
Bobby Nichols. Phil Rodgers had 213, and Nicklaus was two shots
behind at 214.</TE>
<TE>   Between rounds, Palmer ate a sandwich and gulped down a Coke, then
swigged a pint of chocolate milk before making his way to the first
tee.</TE>
<TE>   Graciously, in the afternoon round, Rodgers and Nichols would fall
off pace and defer to the main characters.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer held a three-shot lead over Nicklaus as he approached the
short, uphill par-five at No. 9. Thinking he could close out Nicklaus
with an eagle or even a birdie, Palmer went for broke, as usual, and
slightly pushed his second shot into the fringe, about 20 feet from
the pin.</TE>
<TE>   "All I still needed to do was make a solid little flip chip and a
putt for birdie, that just might be enough," Palmer recounts in his
book. "The unimaginable happened."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer chili-dipped his chip, the ball moving only inches. The
gallery groaned, Palmer remembering it was so quiet, "I swear you
could hear the blood pumping angrily through my veins."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer made a bogey six.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus, playing two groups ahead, birdied 11, cutting Palmer's
lead to one, and the match was soon tied when Palmer bogeyed the
par-three 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer still could have closed Nicklaus out in regulation, but
missed makable putts on No. 17 and No. 18 to force a Sunday playoff.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, typical of their styles, Palmer finished with 13 three
putts to Nicklaus' one.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was Arnold Palmer, right? On to the playoff!</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Nicklaus, almost eerily calm and confident, opened a
four-shot lead after six holes. Yet, anyone who had seen Palmer erase
a seven-shot deficit to win the 1960 U.S. Open in Denver knew he was
going to make a charge.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact," Nicklaus would say, "I expected it to begin at any
moment."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Palmer cut the lead to one shot after making a birdie on
No. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Palmer found out why Nicklaus was different.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, whenever I mounted a charge I could almost feel that
the player I was chasing was going to collapse and give ground,"
Palmer writes. "It sounds a bit odd, but it was almost as if I could
will the leader to move over and permit me to pass."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Palmer says, Nicklaus was "a different animal altogether,
completely unlike anybody I'd ever chased."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus held off the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer bogeyed No. 13 and fell two shots back.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus, still two shots ahead at No. 18, gave the gallery a
last-gasp hope when he pulled his tee shot. But after Palmer had hit
his second shot fat, Nicklaus safely played his second shot to the
fat of the fairway and hit a nine-iron 12 feet from the cup.</TE>
<TE>   Game over.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer needed a cold shower.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really mad at himself," Jenkins recalls. "He thought he
should have won the tournament. [Writer] Bob Drum and I went to the
parking lot with him and watched him throw his clubs into the trunk.
He thought he should have won by six shots."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, writers would have someone else to follow into
parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it was like, 'Now we got another guy,' " he says of
Nicklaus' arrival. "It was fun. Unlike today, with Tiger, who has
nobody."</TE>
<TE>   Years later, in his autobiography, Nicklaus confessed to what
everyone knew: He respected Palmer but never feared him.</TE>
<TE>   "In a nutshell, once the whistle had blown, Arnold Palmer was just
another player, another guy trying to go my way on a track only wide
enough for one. I wanted to win, and then win and win and win
again--every time I teed it up, now and forever."</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, Nicklaus wishes he could have been more expressive
with his feelings instead of being so consumed with his aims and
ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Truth was, and he knew it, many didn't appreciate Nicklaus' taking
the U.S. Open title from Palmer at Oakmont.</TE>
<TE>   It would take time for fans to cozy up to Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "He had to take off that rain hat, fluff-dry his hair and have
[wife] Barbara dress him before he was beloved," Jenkins jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus said the breakthrough event was his shattering Ben
Hogan's course record in winning the 1965 Masters. That was the week
fans rooted for him, the way they had for Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   No more black hat.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at last beginning to emerge from the shadow of Arnold,"
Nicklaus writes, "and was becoming a golfer people could enjoyably
follow and yell and holler and whoop for."</TE>
<TE>   Foes and Friends</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and Nicklaus became fierce rivals after Oakmont. They tried
to out-do and one-up each other until Nicklaus eventually separated
himself in the race. Even as they grew older and played together
less, each player would check the other's scores in the morning
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   When Palmer won the 1962 British Open, Nicklaus answered by
winning two majors in 1963, the Masters and PGA. Palmer countered by
defeating Nicklaus in the 1964 Masters--amazingly, the king's last
major victory.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Time magazine noted, "Whatever Arnie wants, Jack gets,"
and that was pretty much the case.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, though, did not surrender without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, before the last PGA Tour event, the Cajun Classic, Palmer
led Nicklaus in earnings by $318.87.</TE>
<TE>   Neither player really wanted to play the last event, but neither
was going to let the other walk away with the money title.</TE>
<TE>   Miller Barber ended up winning the tournament, but the final-day
drama almost approached that of Oakmont in 1962. To win the earnings
title, Palmer needed Gay Brewer to sink an 18-foot putt on No. 18 to
finish second and knock Nicklaus to third. A miss by Brewer would
leave Nicklaus in a tie for second and give Jack the money title.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer missed the putt, and Palmer described his disappointment as
"immense."</TE>
<TE>   More than 35 years after losing to Nicklaus at Oakmont, Palmer
would write, "On the course, there was--and still is--nobody I ever
wanted to beat more."</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship is best described as cordial and complex.</TE>
<TE>   You might have expected Nicklaus vs. Palmer to turn nasty as
Palmer grew increasingly envious of the man who dethroned him as
golf's greatest player.</TE>
<TE>   But it never really evolved into that.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was Palmer, a man who was almost impossible not to
like.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus could never get over how gracious Palmer was in those
early years. It was Palmer, 10 years older, who helped Nicklaus learn
the ropes on the PGA Tour, Palmer who encouraged Nicklaus to become a
pilot, Palmer who introduced Nicklaus to his agent, Mark McCormack,
at International Management Group.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was Nicklaus, who never turned his personal quest to
eclipse the feats of his boyhood hero, Bobby Jones, into a personal
crusade.</TE>
<TE>   "Arnold wasn't a guy he wanted to knock off the pedestal," Bowden
says of Nicklaus. "Jack wanted to put himself on it, and if Arnold
fell off in the meantime, OK. That's the way it is in sport."</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was the sport. Golfers are paired together in
competition but not pitted against each other. Palmer never had to
box Nicklaus out for a rebound, or put a 90-mph fastball under his
chin.</TE>
<TE>   Golf is a monologue, played against oneself and the course. It
wasn't Nicklaus' fault Palmer three-putted 13 times at the 1962 U.S.
Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard as I sometimes had to fight Arnold's galleries," Nicklaus
reflects in his book, "the only way I ever had to fight him was with
my golf clubs."</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was logistics. Palmer and Nicklaus were together a lot
on the PGA Tour. They played exhibitions and traveled the world in
each other's company. The players' wives, Barbara Nicklaus and the
late Winnie Palmer, became close friends.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was common sense.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus and Palmer were good for each other, no, great for each
other.</TE>
<TE>   "Palmer and Nicklaus will always be inseparable the same way that
are Mantle and Mays, Evert and Navratilova, and Ali and Frazier are
inseparable in baseball, tennis and boxing," Feinstein writes in "The
Majors." "In truth, Palmer and Nicklaus may go beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   That's because, unlike other sports, their rivalry has spanned
four decades.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and Nicklaus, along with Gary Player, the other cog who
made up "the Big Three," took golf off sports' back burner.</TE>
<TE>   The Palmer-Nicklaus rivalry spiked interest in golf and drove up
gate receipts and tournament purses.</TE>
<TE>   "We were natural adversaries, to be sure," Palmer writes, "but
also clearly a good fit."</TE>
<TE>   It would be a stretch to suggest that Nicklaus over Palmer at
Oakmont, 40 years ago this month, in Palmer's backyard and on his
back nine, had a profound impact in golf history.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to fathom how a victory by Palmer would have staved off
Nicklaus' mounting call to greatness.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Oakmont did offer a snapshot at what golf was and what it was
going to become.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line, with Jack on attack, golf was never the same for
Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   He would remark of Nicklaus after Oakmont, "Now that the big guy
is out of the cage, everybody better run for cover."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody ran.</TE>

<HD>Belgium's Stay Could Be Fast Drawing to a Close</HD>

<LD>Belgium tied Tunisia, 1-1, in a World Cup match Monday in Oita,
Japan, life proceeding as usual here. Ronaldo scores, Argentina
fouls, Ireland never quits, Brad Friedel saves the Americans' bacon
and Belgium ties.</LD>
<LD>   That's five tied World Cup matches in a row for Belgium, which
didn't see a game it couldn't draw in 1998. In France four years ago,
the Belgians tied the Netherlands, Mexico and South Korea, completing
the very rare and difficult trick of going undefeated in the first
round and failing to qualify for the second.</LD>
<LD>   Belgium has played two more World Cup matches in Japan, and tied
those--2-2 against Japan before Monday's draw against Tunisia.</LD>
<TE>   Even when it comes to soccer politics, when Belgium campaigned
aggressively to host the 2000 European championships, it wound up
splitting the vote and sharing the competition with the Netherlands.
Another tie.</TE>
<TE>   Too much of anything, however, is never good, and for the second
time in as many World Cups, Belgium is poised to be eliminated
without having lost a match. With two points in two matches, Belgium
enters its final group game against Russia two points behind Japan
(1-0-1) and one behind Russia (1-1-0).</TE>
<TE>   This time, Belgium took the lead in the 13th minute, on a goal by
captain Marc Wilmots, only to watch Tunisia score four minutes later
on 30-yard free kick by Raouf Bouzaiane.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not really happy," Belgium Coach Robert Waseige said,
"because everybody probably felt that it would be easy to play
Tunisia, but that was not true....</TE>
<TE>   "We always have problems against smaller nations and Tunisia is a
smaller nation.... Belgium has always played better when we have not
been the favorites."</TE>
<TE>   With the draw, Tunisia (0-1-1) still can qualify for the next
round with a victory over Japan Friday. Tunisian defender Hatem
Trabelsi, however, believes such as task is beyond the reach of his
team.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan [is] the strongest team in the group and the favorite," he
said. "Tunisia can't win the match against Japan. It is too difficult
for us. We only try to make it a good match."</TE>

<HD>Two Group G Coaches Just Speak Their Minds</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Mexico and Italy are bracing for Thursday's important Group G finale
with mental stability on their minds.</LD>
<LD>   After beating Ecuador, 2-1, Sunday, Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre
praised his team's newfound mental toughness. After losing to
Croatia, 2-1, Saturday, Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni defended his
sanity in a contentious meeting with Italian media.</LD>
<LD>   "I've not lost my marbles yet," Trapattoni said in response to
questions about his lineup selection. "Do you think I didn't consider
all the options for the team?"</LD>
<TE>   Trapattoni has been criticized for abandoning the three-forward
alignment Italy used during its undefeated World Cup qualification
campaign, during which Francesco Totti played behind two strikers.
Here, Trapattoni has played with a more orthodox two-forward line of
Totti and Christian Vieri.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen the world champions play with three strikers here
and lose," Trapattoni said, referring to France. "You can say, 'Well,
if [Filippo] Inzaghi or someone else had played ... ' But these
aren't the things that make you win. You don't win because you have
one striker more or one striker less."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre believes a team succeeds during the World Cup by remaining
mentally as well as physically strong. Toward that end, Aguirre began
Mexico's pre-tournament training camp with 12 days of three-a-day
practices--testing his players' resolve and focus.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my first job, that's the part that I like," Aguirre said.
"I love to work with the Mexican players and their minds. In the
past, Mexico has had very good players, but sometimes we're kind of
weak here."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre pointed to his head.</TE>
<TE>   "So, we have to improve that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre was encouraged when his team fell behind Ecuador on a
fifth-minute goal but didn't lose its poise. Mexico equalized it
within 23 minutes, scored again in the 57th minute and then held its
composure under considerable pressure as Ecuador pushed the Mexican
defense hard in the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "So, we must be doing it right, or what?" Aguirre said with a
grin.</TE>

<TE>   Mexico midfielder Gerardo Torrado, taking the Samson story and
turning it on its head, believes he draws strength from cutting his
hair. Torrado shaved his head just before the start of the World Cup,
saying he did the same just before a crucial qualification match
against the U.S. in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Result: Mexico won and went on to qualify for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Newly shorn again, Torrado scored only the second goal of his
career with the national team Sunday against Ecuador--the go-ahead
goal, a running blast from just outside the penalty area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only my second goal for Mexico, but it was the most
important," Torrado said. "It is incredible to score a goal at the
World Cup. I dedicate it to my family and my girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   Torrado knows Mexico will be the underdog. "We must not think we
have qualified because [of the victory over Ecuador]," he said.
"Italy will be very difficult for us in our next match, much more
than the two we have played. We have to play to win. Or else we could
be doing them and Croatia a favor."</TE>

<HD>Portugal Tears Poles Apart, 4-0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rebounding from an upset loss to the United States, Portugal took out
its frustration on Poland in no uncertain terms Monday night as it
thrashed the Poles, 4-0, in front of 31,000 rain-drenched fans in
Jeonju, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   No one enjoyed the evening more than Pauleta, who scored the
second hat trick of the Korea/Japan '02 World Cup with goals in the
14th, 65th and 77th minutes. Two came from his right foot and one
from his left.</LD>
<LD>   That matched the treble achieved by Germany's Miroslav Klose in an
8-0 rout of Saudi Arabia earlier in the tournament.</LD>
<TE>   Rui Costa added the fourth for Portugal, which gained three points
and moved into third place in Group D behind South Korea and the
U.S., which each have four. Each team has one game left to play in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good win today," said Portugal Coach Antonio Oliveira,
who was celebrating his 50th birthday. "The players gave their all
for their country.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased. We used a different strategy against Poland
than the one we did against the United States and it paid off. The
most important thing was that all the players contributed."</TE>
<TE>   Pauleta was the leading goal scorer in the French first division
with 22 goals and his success Monday justified Oliveira's faith in
the Bordeaux striker despite Pauleta not having always lived up to
expectations with the national team.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, with consecutive losses and no goals scored, was
eliminated from advancing further in the tournament. It closes its
campaign against the U.S. on Thursday in Daejeon, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "As time went on, our morale went down," said despondent Coach
Jerzy Engel. "We had many defensive mistakes."</TE>

<HD>Levine Has Soreness</HD>

<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels' interest in trading for pitching help was heightened
Monday, when reliever Al Levine underwent tests after complaining of
pain in his pitching shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Levine, the primary setup man for closer Troy Percival, faced six
batters Sunday and retired two. In his last six appearances, he has
given up eight hits and five walks over five innings. Manager Mike
Scioscia said Levine had pitched with some discomfort and said the
affected shoulder was "throbbing a little bit" after Sunday's game.</LD>
<LD>   An MRI examination Monday did not show any irregularities. Levine
is scheduled for further examination today.</LD>
<TE>   Levine, Lou Pote and Ben Weber have struggled on occasion
recently, and Dennis Cook is the lone left-handed reliever. The
Angels would like to acquire another left-handed reliever, and they
wouldn't mind adding a reliever who could come in and strike someone
out, since Percival is their only power arm in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Angel President Paul Pressler said Disney would be willing to
consider adding to a club-record $60-million player payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "Short of injuries, it's not clear that we need anything else to
make a pennant run," Pressler said. "If we really felt the team
needed shoring up, of course we would evaluate it. You don't want to
get too far out and miss an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman said any deal, whether for depth in
the bullpen or elsewhere, would be a modest one.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to go out there and do something for huge
dollars," he said. "If we can take on a little extra salary for
measurable help, we'll look at that."</TE>
<TE>   However, as Scioscia noted, the Angels aren't the only team
looking for pitching help.</TE>
<TE>   "When everybody's going after the same chip, it becomes a
challenge," Scioscia said. "It's a tough commodity to acquire. But,
if we don't get pitching help, I think we have a championship-caliber
staff anyway."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman interested in buying the
Angels, continues to evaluate financial information provided by
Disney. That evaluation will determine whether he raises, lowers,
abandons or restates his preliminary bid of $250 million. Watkins is
believed to be the only suitor to inspect the Angels' books recently,
and Disney is expected to run the team at least through the end of
the season.</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Closing In</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim beats Pittsburgh, 4-3, and is only one
behind Seattle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners sprinted to the lead. The Angels sprinted to
catch up. So, just in time for summer fun, the Angels are pleased to
present a race to the division title.</LD>
<LD>   In the American League West, the wild-card might not be available
as a consolation prize. The winner might take all. And, amazingly
enough for those fans who witnessed the Angels stumble their way
through the opening weeks of the season, that winner might just be
the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are one game behind the once-mighty Mariners, after
home runs from Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus powered a 4-3 victory
over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday. Jarrod Washburn shut out the
Pirates for the first six innings and won his sixth consecutive
decision, and Troy Percival earned his sixth save in nine days and
14th of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a little early to talk about a pennant race right now, but
we're definitely paying attention to the standings," Washburn said.
"If we play like we have been, then we'll be in a pennant race until
the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle won 17 of its first 21 games, opening up a 10 1/2 game
lead on the Angels. But the Angels won 21 of 24, and the Angels now
own the curious distinction of having the worst start in franchise
history (6-14) and the best start (37-24).</TE>
<TE>   Since the Angels visited Seattle in late April, the Mariners are
two games over .500, no longer invincible, stumbling along without
designated hitter Edgar Martinez and desperately in search of help
for their pitching staff. And the Oakland Athletics, left for dead
not long ago, won their fifth consecutive game Monday; they're six
games out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it being real easy," Angel pitcher Kevin Appier said.
"If we were to pass the Mariners, I don't see us coasting our way to
the division [title]. I don't think Oakland is out of it, either. I
think it will be pretty close down to the wire."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia tempered the excitement, understandable
under any circumstances and especially so with a franchise notorious
for teasing fans all summer and breaking their hearts come September.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not raising any banners here," Scioscia said. "We
understand the challenge in front of us. The challenge is not to play
good baseball for six weeks. It's to play good baseball for six
months."</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees have the two best
records in the American League. If that holds, one will begin the
playoffs as champion of the American League East and the other as the
wild-card, leaving the Angels, Mariners and A's to fight for one
playoff invitation.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about reconciling weird statistics: Washburn had not won at
Edison Field in 11 months, but he has not lost any of his last 10
starts, in any park. In his first seven starts at home this season,
he had two losses and five no-decisions and a perfectly reasonable
earned-run average of 3.86.</TE>
<TE>   But victory is assured if the other team does not score, and so
Washburn held the Pirates scoreless for the first six innings, on
three hits. Pittsburgh knocked him out in the seventh, after a home
run from Craig Wilson and consecutive doubles and after 110 pitches
in all.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little gassed," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a little bit of a dead arm. I didn't feel like I had any
life in my fastball."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn is expected to make his next start. By then, since power
hitters tend to be streaky, Glaus could be on a hot streak. His cold
streak beginning play Monday: nine for 67 (.134).</TE>
<TE>   He had two hits, including a two-run homer in the first inning.
Anderson had two hits too, including a solo home run in the sixth.
Glaus and Anderson share the team lead in homers, with 13 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon had two more hits too. His batting average, which
bottomed out at .135 in April, is at .282. Since April ended, Salmon
is hitting .350.</TE>

<HD>Lowe Gets 10th Win by Limiting Rockies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe doesn't get too many chances to end a losing streak--not
with Pedro Martinez in the Boston Red Sox rotation.</LD>
<LD>   When he gets the chance, though, Lowe can be every bit the stopper
as the Boston ace.</LD>
<LD>   "He's developing into the same kind of pitcher," Red Sox Manager
Grady Little said Monday night after Lowe defeated the Colorado
Rockies, 7-3, at Boston to become the American League's first 10-game
winner. "You know your team really expects to win a game when he goes
out there."</LD>
<TE>   Lowe (10-2) gave up two runs and a season-high eight hits, struck
out three and walked none to end Boston's three-game losing streak.
He left after six innings with a 7-2 lead as a precaution because a
blister developed on his right thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe has only started three games this season after a Red Sox
loss, and won all. Martinez, who typically follows the No. 5 starter
in the rotation, has started four times after the Red Sox have lost
two in a row and won all.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 6, Montreal 4--Robert Fick homered twice and drove in five
runs to help the host Tigers end a six-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Bernero (2-2) became the first Detroit starter to win since
May 29.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 8, San Diego 6--Melvin Mora hit a tiebreaking, two-run
homer in the eighth inning at Baltimore and drove in a career-high
five runs.</TE>
<TE>   Mora hit a three-run double in the second inning. The homer was
his third in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Cleveland 1--Terry Adams pitched six strong
innings at Cleveland and the Phillies won for the fourth time in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Adams (3-4) got 15 of his 18 outs on balls that never got past the
infield.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 8, Cincinnati 2--Ismael Valdes (4-5) took a shutout into the
ninth inning at Arlington, Texas, and the Rangers ended a three-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   John Rocker, recalled Sunday from triple-A Oklahoma, got the final
two outs in his first major league appearance since May 18.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Atlanta 5--Cristian Guzman doubled in the winning run
in the 15th inning at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Ligtenberg (0-3), who had gone 11 consecutive appearances
without giving up an earned run, gave up a two-out infield single to
Tom Prince in the 15th. Prince scored on Guzman's hit.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 3, Chicago White Sox 1--Pedro Astacio (7-2) gave up
five hits in seven innings and shook off nearly two hours of delays
at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The first pitch was delayed 1 hour 37 minutes because of heavy
rain, and a power outage stopped play for 16 minutes in the top of
the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 10, St. Louis 0--Jamie Moyer (6-2) pitched his first
shutout in nearly four years and the Mariners pounded 14 hits at
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki tripled, doubled and singled, Charles Gipson hit a
two-run triple and Mike Cameron doubled twice for the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Milwaukee 6--Ramon Hernandez's run-scoring double in
the eighth inning gave the Athletics back the lead after they let a
five-run advantage slip away at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 15, Kansas City 8--Derrek Lee homered twice for the second
consecutive game for the Marlins, who scored seven times in the 14th
inning at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Lee scored four runs and drove in three. The Marlins blew leads in
the ninth and 12th innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Chicago Cubs 2--Wade Miller (1-2) pitched seven strong
innings and won for the first time this season, and Lance Berkman hit
his 20th home run for the Astros at Houston.</TE>

<LD>Congress is going to look into steroid use in baseball, after the
recent disclosure that two former league most valuable players used
the muscle-building drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) said Monday he plans to hold a hearing
that also will look at steroid use in the Olympics and among college
athletes. Dorgan is chairman of the consumer affairs, foreign
commerce and tourism subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody knows how damaging use of these steroids are to
athletes' health," Dorgan said. "We've got an issue to face as a
country, not just among baseball players, but also with college
sports and our Olympic athletes."</LD>
<TE>   No date has been set for the hearing. Dorgan said he plans to
invite baseball executives, players and union representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Steroids have become a major topic in baseball since former MVPs
Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco admitted using the drugs. Caminiti
retired last year, and Canseco ended his 17-year career this spring.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how many current players take steroids. Canseco told
The Wall Street Journal that up to 85% took steroids when he played.
Some players, such as Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine, say that estimate
is far too high.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL and NBA prohibit steroids and tests for them, but Major
League Baseball does not.</TE>

<TE>   Roger Clemens' fastball that plunked Barry Bonds might cost the
New York Yankee ace more than a little respect.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball is looking into whether Clemens should be disciplined for
hitting the San Francisco slugger--as he hinted he might do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's under investigation," a spokesman in major league
disciplinarian Bob Watson's office said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds said last winter he wanted to face Clemens. Asked last week
about pitching to Bonds, Clemens mentioned the protective piece Bonds
wears on his right arm.</TE>
<TE>   "I will introduce myself pretty quick," Clemens said, to "that big
old piece of plastic he has on his elbow."</TE>

<TE>   Boston outfielder Manny Ramirez took batting practice, a week
earlier than expected, putting him on schedule for a possible return
this weekend. He has been out since May 11 because of a broken
finger.... The Yankees put closer Mariano Rivera on the 15-day
disabled list because of a strained groin and outfielder Juan Rivera
because of a broken kneecap.... The New York Mets fired hitting coach
Dave Engle. The Mets rank 13th in runs and 14th in batting average in
the National League</TE>

<LD>Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel has a problem with the Detroit
Red Wings' opponent in the Stanley Cup finals:</LD>
<LD>   "If ever there were a sign that the sports world is entering the
third ring of hell, here it is: The Carolina Hurricanes are in the
Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   "And I'm not saying the fans in Carolina are hockey hillbillies,
but if the Hurricanes win, there is already talk of changing the name
of Lord Stanley's Cup to Cousin Stanley's Corn Liquor Jug."</LD>
<TE>   Wing nuts: Nick and Sarah Arena of Maumee, Ohio, consider
themselves big Red Wing fans. So much so, that when Sarah gave birth
to a boy Thursday, the couple named him Joe Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Add the last name and he's Joe Louis Arena, as in the stadium
where the Red Wings play their home games.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think you can't do that to a baby," Sarah told
WTOL-TV in Toledo, "but most people start laughing right away and
they think it's a really cool thing."</TE>

Britain, Italy, the United States and World Cup co-host Japan will
battle it out starting Thursday on the full-size pitch at Klong Prem
prison, cheered by foreign embassy staff and local officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would help the prisoners relax," said Thitiporn
Tharappome, chief of foreign relations at the prison, which houses
1,132 foreign inmates serving sentences for crimes such as drug
trafficking and murder.</TE>
<TE>   For these guys, drawing a red card probably isn't a big deal.</TE>

<TE>   Yes, alcohol reportedly was involved.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you say: John Schuerholz, general manager of the Atlanta
Braves, says there won't be any favoritism directed toward his son
Jonathan, an Auburn infielder, who was drafted in the eighth round by
the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "His last name doesn't matter at all," the elder Schuerholz said.

it."</TE>

Jordan in their prime?</TE>
<TE>   A poll of NBA personnel found, Schmitz wrote, that "Shaq is en
route to replacing Michael in the minds of many as the most dominant
player in the modern era." But Phil Jackson, who has coached both
players, picked Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to do with leadership, competitive nature," Jackson told
Schmitz. "Michael is in a class by himself in that regard."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Off Course With Jack Wagner"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, today, 4:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Actor Jack Wagner, a scratch golfer, talks with celebrities in a
comfortable setting while playing golf in this half-hour show that
makes its debut today. Others, such as Ann Liguori and Peter
Jacobsen, have done similar shows, but this one, as the title
suggests, is a little offbeat. Your first hint will be the appearance
of a mariachi band on the putting green, in honor of the show's first
guest, Alex Rodriguez, who plays to a 10 handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Ranger shortstop--and baseball's highest-paid
player--also takes Wagner to the ballpark and shows him a few things
about baseball.</TE>
<TE>   While playing at a Dallas country club, Rodriguez gladly fields
some off-beat questions--and asks some too. One thing he wants to
know is which actress, in Wagner's opinion, is the best kisser.
Wagner, best known for his roles as Dr. Peter Burns in "Melrose
Place" and as Frisco Jones in "General Hospital," says Heather
Locklear.</TE>
<TE>   That may be a diplomatic answer, since Locklear will be the
featured guest on the second show June 18. Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura will be on the third show June 25.</TE>
<TE>   "Off Course," which precedes "Mohr Sports," will move to a 5:30
p.m. time slot in September.</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the show is some fun facts that pop up on the
screen. One informs viewers that in the time it takes to play 18
holes of golf, Rodriguez has made $35,000.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER MIKE PENNER</KH>
<HD>Agoos an Example of Age Gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Jeff Agoos is 34, three years older than any other starter who was in
the U.S. lineup against South Korea on Monday and 14 years older than
either of the outside midfielders playing in front of him in the game
at Daegu, South Korea, DaMarcus Beasley and Landon Donovan.</LD>
<LD>   That is worth mentioning, because Agoos is having the kind of
World Cup that needs some explaining. Two games into it, Agoos has
already experienced a defender's nightmare trifecta: He has scored an
own goal, been whistled for a penalty and been beaten by a smaller
South Korean opponent for a header that cost his team a victory.</LD>
<LD>   Not all of this is Agoos' fault. He can't do anything about the
numbers on his birth certificate, and he's not the one making out the
U.S. lineup. Before Bruce Arena, a longtime Agoos loyalist, was
calling the shots, two other U.S. World Cup coaches gave Agoos long
looks during training camp. Bora Milutinovic cut Agoos in 1994. Steve
Sampson gave Agoos a spot on the roster, but not a minute of playing
time in '98.</LD>
<TE>   There's a billboard in Yokohama's upscale shopping district
touting local tourism that reads, "Slow Is Beautiful." The bright
mind who came up with that marketing slogan obviously had no rooting
interest in the World Cup. In this tournament, slow means old, and
old has never been more out of style than in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Not very long ago, veteran players could hang around the World Cup
because experience was considered an asset and a few old hands were
essential to any serious run at the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Maradona played in four World Cups, Juergen Klinsmann in three,
and both were still scoring important goals in their mid-30s. Roger
Milla was 38 when his four goals lifted Cameroon to the 1990
quarterfinals--and 42 when, in 1994, he became the oldest man to
score a goal in a World Cup. Romania pleaded with Gheorge Hagi to
delay his retirement until after the 1998 tournament--and because he
did, Romania was able to qualify for the second round.</TE>
<TE>   But then, that was 20th-century soccer. In this millennium, it has
become a sport in a hurry, a game with no patience. Did you notice
how long 33-year-old Gabriel Batistuta, still as dangerous a striker
as there is in this tournament, lasted when Argentina fell behind
England? In dire need of a goal, Coach Marcelo Bielsa substituted
Batistuta in the 60th minute, rushing in a pair of younger legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Date of birth" has become the World Cup's most vital statistic,
which helps explain why France is 90 minutes away from abandoning its
title defense in the first round, why Croatia lost to a very ordinary
Mexico, why Japan and South Korea are both undefeated after two
games, why Michael Owen continues to give Argentina fits, why Poland
is 0-2 and out of contention, and why the United States is still in
the running for first place in Group D.</TE>
<TE>   Speed is the hot commodity in Japan and South Korea, stamping
footprints all over the things that used to matter at the World
Cup--pedigree, tradition and history. Argentina, Germany, Italy and
Brazil all used to get away with a lot simply because they were named
Argentina, Germany, Italy and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   No more. Italy lost to Croatia when Croatia's Coach Mirko Jozic
figured out why his aging team, third place in 1998, had lost its
opener to Mexico and began benching his aged. In came the Croatian
youth movement, down went Italy by a 2-1 count.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina had England's number, or so everyone thought. Everyone
forgot or dismissed how Owen had diced Argentina's defense four years
earlier, when he was 18. Owen is 22 now and the turbojets don't fire
quite the same, which means Owen is faster than only 90% of the
forwards in the tournament. Argentina couldn't handle him without
fouling him--and when Mauricio Pochettino did that, inside the
penalty area, England had the break it needed for a 1-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   France is in the incredible position of needing a two-goal victory
over Denmark today to avoid becoming the second defending
champion--Brazil in 1966 was the first--to be eliminated in the first
round. More incredibly, France has played 90 minutes against Senegal,
making its World Cup debut, and 90 against Uruguay, in its first
World Cup since 1990, and has not scored.</TE>
<TE>   How is this possible?</TE>
<TE>   Les Bleus got gray, and Coach Roger Lemerre did nothing about it.
France won the 1998 World Cup largely on the strength of its
exceptional back line. Marcel Desailly, Frank Leboeuf and Bixente
Lizarazu were all over 30, though, when they helped add the 2000
European championship to the French trophy case.</TE>
<TE>   Lemerre's players kept getting older, but they gave him no
compelling reason to replace them--until the opener against Senegal,
when Leboeuf, 34, was badly beaten by El Hadji Diouf, 21, whose low
cross bounced off a scrambling Emmanuel Petit, 31, and fell to Papa
Bouba Diop, 24, who scored the game's only goal.</TE>
<TE>   Also, France had to play its first two matches without its
playmaker, Zinedine Zidane, who looks 40 but doesn't turn 30 until
June 23. How good is Zidane, who has been sidelined by a thigh
injury? By not playing a minute, he has established himself as the
tournament's most valuable player.</TE>
<TE>   Again, that French score line: Two games played without Zidane, no
goals scored.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, co-hosts Japan and South Korea, previously
winless in World Cup play, and the U.S., a dead-last 32nd in 1998,
are each undefeated after two games because they figured out how to
narrow the talent gap: Outrun it.</TE>
<TE>   Japan and South Korea play at video-game hyper-speed. Arena turned
the U.S. around--and it was an all-or-nothing gamble--by turning it
over to the kids. Beasley on the left, Donovan on the right, each 20,
each supposedly too slight to withstand World Cup rigors, have defied
that notion by daring teams to catch them if they can.</TE>
<TE>   For two games, they have supplied an energy charge that has
stunned opponents and longtime U.S. watchers alike. It might not last
much longer, once opposing coaches break down the tapes and assign
faster markers to Beasley and Donovan. Or maybe Poland on Friday or
Italy in the second round, if and when, will send in the enforcers,
and that will end that.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe not. Either way, Beasley and Donovan offer new potential,
the hint of the unexpected that escaped the staid Cobi Jones-Claudio
Reyna-Earnie Stewart axis long ago.</TE>
<TE>   One downside about all these youngsters at the World Cup: the
haircuts.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forward Clint Mathis edges Germany's Christian Ziege in extra
time for worst World Cup Mohawk. Ziege, at least, keeps his neatly
trimmed and dyed in the German team's color scheme; Mathis looks as
if he lost a 50-50 challenge with a weed whacker.</TE>
<TE>   England's David Beckham and Sweden's Fredrik Ljungberg are vying
for the tournament lead for "most goals scored by a player coiffed
like a rooster." The Japanese players apparently hold team-bonding
sessions around the hair-coloring display at the local department
store.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Taribo West, the Nigerian defender who shaves all
of his head except for two small sprigs of hair at the top of his
scalp, each wrapped decoratively in a festive array of colors. There
is a professional soccer club in Japan called the Kashima Antlers.
For the record, West does not play for them.</TE>
<TE>   Say this for Agoos: He's old-school enough to let his hair grow
out, long and natural, the way everybody did in the 1970s, back when
the World Cup still respected its elders. But that was then and this
is now, with the World Cup built for speed and defenders with long
hair written off as aerodynamically incorrect. Especially those in
their 30s.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Grissom, Roberts Are Doing Their Share</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dave Roberts would like to start against a left-handed pitcher, and
Marquis Grissom wouldn't mind a little more playing time, but Manager
Jim Tracy is not about to disrupt his center-field platoon when it's
producing like it is.</LD>
<LD>   Grissom hit a two-run home run in the second inning Monday night
to jump-start a 14-hit attack, as the Dodgers whipped the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, 10-5, in an interleague game played before 10,905 in
Tropicana Field.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Green's three-run home run, his 15th of the season,
highlighted a five-run fifth, Paul Lo Duca had an RBI triple in the
sixth and an RBI double in the eighth, and No. 9 batter Hiram
Bocachica had a double, single and two runs batted in to help the
Dodgers move within a game of first-place Arizona in the National
League West.</LD>
<TE>   Right-hander Hideo Nomo, showing better life on his fastball and
better control, gave up three runs and six hits in six innings to win
for the fourth time in five starts and improve to 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has been a spark plug at the top of the order, hitting
.320 with a .401 on-base percentage, and Grissom has provided power
in the middle, ranking third on the team with eight home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Roberts and Grissom have produced a center-field
position that is batting .309 with nine home runs, 36 runs batted in,
43 runs, 16 stolen bases and a .373 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Dodger center fielders, primarily Grissom and Tom
Goodwin, combined to hit .236 with 19 homers, 70 RBIs, 93 runs, 27
stolen bases and a .282 on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity to use both guys and build an environment for
both to have optimum success is the way to go," Tracy said of Roberts
and Grissom. "Both are shining, and we sacrifice nothing defensively
in center field.</TE>
<TE>   "They bring different things to the lineup--Roberts is an energy
guy at the top of the order, and Grissom is a home-run threat in the
middle--and we still have a good leadoff hitter in Cesar Izturis from
the right side [when Grissom starts]."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, 35, was bitter about being a platoon player last season,
but he came to spring training this season with a different attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it came from Sept. 11," Grissom said. "I hate to say it,
but it woke me up. It was 50% Sept. 11 and 50% myself--how I felt as
a father, a husband, a son.... I found an inner peace to be
successful in life, so baseball is maybe third or fourth or fifth on
the list [of priorities] behind my family, my kids. That made it a
bit easier to accept."</TE>

bullpen in late March, has replaced the injured Kevin Brown in the
rotation, and now he wants to stay. "If I'm a starter, why would I
want to be traded?" he said. "It would make no sense." The Dodgers,
who have hit 28 home runs in the last 17 games and are averaging 6.3
runs in their last 23 games, are 14-3 against left-handed starters,
and they'll face another one tonight in Kennedy.</TE>

<HD>Brown's Back for More Surgery</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Procedure to repair disk today, his second
operation since September, to sideline him at least a month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown will undergo surgery today at USC Medical
Center to repair a herniated disk in his lower back, a procedure that
will sideline him for at least another month and possibly the
remainder of the season, putting a considerable dent in Dodger
pennant hopes.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Robert Watkins will perform a microscopic laser diskectomy, in
which a fiber optics device is inserted in the back and the portion
of the bulging disk that is putting pressure on nerve endings is
shaved away.</LD>
<LD>   It is Brown's second surgery in nine months--he had surgery to
repair a torn tendon in his right elbow last September--and it
further clouds the future of the 37-year-old right-hander, who has
three years and $45 million remaining on a seven-year, $105-million
contract.</LD>
<TE>   "I've heard nothing from the doctors to indicate his career is in
jeopardy at this point; I just want him back healthy, with a healthy
elbow and a healthy back," General Manager Dan Evans said during the
Dodgers' 10-5 interleague victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on
Monday night. "I'm trying to remain optimistic that we'll have him
back [this season], but there's no way of telling until after the
surgery."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, on the disabled list since May 27 because of inflammation
in his elbow, said he sustained the back injury while playfully
wrestling with one of his sons at home on May 29.</TE>
<TE>   He was in such pain he that checked himself into Centinela
Hospital Medical Center on June 3 and spent four nights in the
hospital. Brown, who is 2-3 with a 4.06 earned-run average in nine
starts, was admitted to USC Medical Center Monday night and will
remain there until Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger trainer Stan Johnston said doctors won't know the extent of
the back injury or how long the recovery period will be until the
operation is complete.</TE>
<TE>   "They might get in there and see something else, so until [the
surgery] is done, you don't know," Johnston said. "They won't get a
full picture until they get in there.... But there's no concern at
this point that the nerve is damaged."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have grown accustomed to life without Brown--he has
been on the disabled list five times in the last two seasons--but it
doesn't get any easier.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to lose somebody like Brownie," catcher Paul Lo Duca
said. "I could care less about baseball now; I just hope he comes out
of it and feels better. He's been such a workhorse.... His back has
been bothering him the last couple years, and I think this might have
caused all his arm problems.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we battled our butts off last year and we played
awesome, and we had a lot of injuries. We've been playing well this
year, partly with [Brown] and partly without him. But he's going to
be missed, believe me."</TE>
<TE>   Two prominent big league pitchers underwent back surgery in recent
years, with favorable results. Randy Johnson missed the final five
weeks of the 1996 season because of a herniated disk, had surgery,
and returned to go 20-4 with a 2.28 ERA and 291 strikeouts for
Seattle in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   David Wells had surgery to repair two herniated disks last July 17
and missed the remainder of the season, but he has a 6-2 record and
3.66 ERA in 11 starts for the New York Yankees this season. Arizona
center fielder Steve Finley had a diskectomy after the 2000 season
and returned at full strength in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But neither tried to come back during the season he was hurt. Even
if Brown is cleared to resume baseball activity in a month or so, he
will need several more weeks to build up enough arm strength to
return to the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Dodgers will use a rotation of Andy Ashby,
Odalis Perez, Kazuhisa Ishii, Hideo Nomo and Omar Daal, a staff that
has kept the Dodgers in contention but lacks an ace. The Dodgers,
second in the National League West, a game behind Arizona, are 20-7
with Brown on the disabled list this season and 18-18 when he's been
on the active roster.</TE>
<TE>   "That's playing with numbers," first baseman Eric Karros said. "In
a short series, Kevin is the guy you're going to want out there. You
want a guy with his competitiveness and experience on the mound."</TE>
<TE>   But can the Dodgers win a playoff berth or reach the World Series
without Brown?</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can be very competitive over the long haul," Karros
said. "Certain clubs are built for the long run, other clubs are
built for a short series. In two months, we've proven we can be
competitive, but are we an Arizona that can run a [Curt] Schilling
and Johnson out there in a short series, two horses like that? I
don't know that we're at that level, but no team is like that."</TE>
<TE>   A deep rotation, Manager Jim Tracy said, should afford Brown time
to heal properly and not be rushed back.</TE>
<TE>   "We know how good we are with him, but we've been pretty darn good
without him, so let's give him a chance to get well," Tracy said.
"This is another hurdle for us, and we'll get over it."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Lower Ticket Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with a rapidly dwindling fan base, the Mighty Ducks will reduce
season ticket prices on 9,053 seats--mostly on the upper level--for
games at the Arrowhead Pond next season. Prices elsewhere will remain
frozen, including individual game tickets.</LD>
<LD>   "It is our 10th season, so we wanted to make a nice gesture to
fans to say thank you," said Doug Moss, the Ducks' senior vice
president of business operations. "Like every business, we reviewed
the situation. Are we priced correctly?"</LD>
<LD>   Fans would have to say "no," considering the Ducks' performance in
recent seasons.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks have reached the playoffs only twice, and finished last
in the NHL's Western Conference in 2000-01 and were tied for 13th in
the 15-team conference last season.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of success on the ice cost the Ducks at the box office.
They were once a hot ticket and played to 99.4% capacity in the
17,174-seat Pond during the 1997-98 season. But the team's poor
performances and controversial moves by management eroded the fan
base.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to mend fences and show people we care about them," Moss
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks were last in the NHL in attendance and had only 67%
capacity at the Pond last season. In 41 home games, they had the 21
smallest crowds in franchise history. And that counts all tickets
sold. Fans actually at the games last season dwindled to as few as an
estimated 5,000 on several occasions. Per team policy, the Ducks
don't release information on season-ticket sales. But where season
tickets were once capped at about 13,000, they were down to an
estimated 8,000 last season.</TE>
<TE>   With the changes, the average Duck ticket costs $40.34, down from
$43.51.</TE>

<LD>   Thurman pitched 2 1/3 innings of scoreless relief and Raul Mondesi
hit a two-run homer for the Toronto Blue Jays, who won their fifth in
a row with a 6-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Monday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm walking on cloud nine right now," Thurman said. "It was
amazing. I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life because
my first major league win came against Barry Bonds and the Giants.
Bonds is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. I've
been idolizing him since I was a kid."</LD>
<TE>   Bonds, who put on a show during batting practice, went 0 for 4
with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I made sure I was out to watch batting practice. It was crazy,"
Thurman said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds hit a ball off SkyDome's hotel in batting practice. He also
hit balls into the fifth deck in right field, off the Hard Rock Cafe
in right and into the Sightlines restaurant in center field.</TE>
<TE>   "We pitched him away all game long," reliever Kelvim Escobar said.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto has won 10 of 11 and is 7-1 under new Manager Carlos
Tosca.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto starter Esteban Loaiza gave up five runs in 3 2/3 innings,
but the Giants managed only two hits against four relievers.</TE>
<TE>   Thurman (1-1), Scott Cassidy and Scott Eyre shut down the Giants
before Escobar retired four batters for his 13th save. He struck out
Bonds with one out and the tying run on first in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   "I was on my game tonight," Escobar said. "When I'm on, I'm on. I
can face anybody."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Open Always Includes These Guarantees</HD>

<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>So nobody can figure out what's going to happen at the U.S. Open this
week? The thing is, if you consider it carefully, you have to admit
that's sort of hard to believe.</LD>
<LD>   You would think that, after 101 years of it, someone would have
left behind a clue here and there.</LD>
<LD>   But unpredictability, that's the U.S. Open style and we probably
should be thankful for that.</LD>
<TE>   And it's not some slick production, like the Super Bowl, because
they're not calling it U.S. Open CII.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods will be the favorite, but that's not unusual. He is
the favorite in every tournament he enters. The Masters champion
might even win the Open, for a second time, and, even better, get
halfway to a potential Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to predict, of course, and we know that's the way
it goes around here.</TE>
<TE>   However, the real truth is that it's not so difficult to predict
some things that will occur at Bethpage Black this week. In fact,
there are some virtual certainties.</TE>
<TE>   Feel free to check them off when they happen.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that there will be total chaos and absolute
gridlock from the golf course on Long Island all the way to the
Midtown Tunnel, since the USGA has all but banned cars and intends to
bus 42,500 spectators back and forth each day. After this experience,
bus riders will understand why they call it Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that no matter what he shoots, Andy Miller, the
son of NBC commentator Johnny Miller, will get some air time.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that some virtual unknown will appear for an
instant atop the leaderboard, someone like 21-year-old qualifier
Kevin Warrick of Division II University of West Florida in Pensacola,
who has never played in a national event. Warrick qualified in Tampa,
one shot behind Greg Norman and tied with John Huston.</TE>
<TE>   Said Warrick: "I watched the Golf Channel a few times and they
showed my name up there under Norman and Huston. It's pretty neat."</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that Singh will miss the cut. Not Vijay, but Jeev
Milkha Singh, a 30-year-old from New Delhi who has never played in a
major and has missed his last three cuts on the European Tour.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that there will be some ridiculous ruling. It
will be reminiscent of 1994 at Oakmont when Ernie Els was awarded a
free drop because a TV crane was ruled a temporary immovable
object--even though it was on wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Els went from a probable double bogey to a par to the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was 1985 at Oakland Hills, when Denis Watson got a
two-shot penalty for waiting too long for his putt to drop and wound
up losing to Andy North by one shot.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that someone will say, "This is one of the most
unfair pin placements in the history of the U.S. Open." It will
remind everyone of the 18th hole at the Olympic Club in 1998 when
nobody could stop a ball on the green unless he covered it with glue
first.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that someone will putt the ball off the green and
back down the fairway, even though the greens are supposed to be flat
enough to slip under a door.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that someone will call Colin Montgomerie a fat
slob. It will be a red-faced, overweight fan with his cap on backward
and holding a beer.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that someone will whiff on a ball in the rough.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that John Daly, who is to the U.S. Open what
stripes are to plaids, will have an incident in which he hits to the
wrong fairway, slaps a ball while walking and trades his caddie for a
box of doughnuts. It is guaranteed that there will not be a playoff.
There was one last year at Southern Hills, the first in eight years,
so we're not due for another.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that Retief Goosen won't repeat as champion. No
one has done that since Curtis Strange in 1989, so we're not due for
that, either.</TE>
<TE>   It is guaranteed that the U.S. Open will be entertaining, quirky,
funny, sad, touching, enthralling and even unpredictable. Except for
the obvious, of course.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Plans to at Least Finish Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Nearing the end of his third season in Los Angeles, Phil Jackson has
given no indication that he will resign before expiration of his
five-year, $30-million coaching contract.</LD>
<LD>   There have been no negotiations to extend Jackson's contract,
either.</LD>
<LD>   "I have not said two years is it," Jackson said Monday. "I mean, I
want to fulfill my contract, that's my first obligation, is to try
and do that. It's a responsibility I owe to Jerry Krause. At that
time, you know, I'd like to think the next step over."</LD>
<TE>   A fine sentiment, except Jerry Krause is the general manager of
the Chicago Bulls, and Jackson's old boss.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," Jackson said, laughing. "Did I say Jerry Krause?
Jerry Buss!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he has been told Red Auerbach is unhappy about the
manner in which his criticism of Jackson has been presented, though
he has not yet spoken to Auerbach. Jackson suggested Auerbach
believed he was misquoted.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has won eight championships as a coach and appears to be
on the verge of tying Auerbach's NBA record of nine.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect a cigar," he said with a smile. "Not lit, hopefully."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson does not have many close friends among fellow NBA coaches
and he rarely gets votes for coach of the year--chosen by the
media--despite his enormous success.</TE>
<TE>   Though he sometimes annoys them, he does have admirers in his own
locker room, and Rick Fox said Monday the players would take up for
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's becoming personal for us [playing] for him," Fox said. "You
keep hearing comments about his ability to coach. There's been
questions about it, with people saying it's just the talent he has.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel as much as he's done for us, we need to come out in his
defense. I didn't have a championship before I met him. Neither did
Kobe. Neither did Shaq. "We're all better players because of him.
It's disappointing to have to defend yourself when you've been as
successful as he's been.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's anything we can do as players, it's come back next
year and do something that hasn't been done since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's jealousy. We recognize where it comes from."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was on Jason Kidd for much of the fourth quarter in Game 3,
a similar late-game strategy Jackson used against Sacramento's Mike
Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   That meant Derek Fisher, who was four for seven from the field and
three for three from the three-point arc, hardly played in the final
quarter. Brian Shaw, who is five inches taller than Fisher, guarded
Kerry Kittles, who is 6 feet 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Nets each shot better than 50% in Game 3, the first
time that's happened in a Finals game since June 4, 1987, when the
Lakers and Boston Celtics did it.... The Lakers have made 17 of 32
three-pointers in Games 2 and 3.</TE>

<KH>NBA FINALS NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS</KH>
<HD>Lakers to Be Money Player?</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: On verge of another title, and with luxury
tax likely to kick in anyway, Buss may be willing to spend more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Sometime soon, it would seem, Phil Jackson will tie leader Red
Auerbach with his ninth NBA coaching title, remarkably, in nine
Finals appearances, and at the same moment pass Pat Riley for the
lead in playoff victories.</LD>
<LD>   And the Lakers will win their third consecutive championship.</LD>
<LD>   And so in the span of three seasons, Shaquille O'Neal will have
gone from a man who couldn't win to a man who wins every year. And
Kobe Bryant will be halfway to Michael Jordan's six championships,
and not yet 24 years old.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers lead the best-of-seven series, three games to none,
over the upstart--formerly downtrodden--New Jersey Nets. Game 4 is
scheduled Wednesday night at Continental Airlines Arena, with Game
5--if there is one--set for the same marsh on Friday night. Almost
everyone involved, though, will have at least one foot out of town by
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On the verge of all that, the Lakers also are quite possibly on
the brink of change and, perhaps, willing to spend some money.</TE>
<TE>   They have seven potential free agents on a 13-man roster, from
their young players (Slava Medvedenko, Devean George, Jelani McCoy)
to those in their prime (Samaki Walker, Lindsey Hunter), to the
relatively seasoned (Mitch Richmond, Brian Shaw).</TE>
<TE>   Among those free agents, only Medvedenko is restricted, meaning
the Lakers can match any offers and retain him. Walker's contract
automatically expires unless he opts to extend for $1.5 million next
season, and Hunter holds the option to terminate his final two
seasons, which otherwise will pay him $3.9 million and $4.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Those seven stood Tuesday morning with their teammates, nearing a
title, along with potential, temporary joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think about that," Walker said. "Not until our work is
done here, as far as getting what we came for. A lot depends on what
the Lakers decide to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have options. The new television deal, struck over the
winter with ABC and AOL-Time Warner, will pay about $2.6 billion over
four years, all but ending the era when new television contracts were
significantly larger than the previous ones.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, teams that assumed the luxury-tax ceiling would rise
steadily--the Lakers among them--probably will find themselves well
into the dollar-for-dollar penalty for exceeding the payroll limit.
Assuming Walker and Hunter return, the Lakers will have eight players
under contract next season whose contracts total about $56 million.
Most NBA officials expect next year's luxury-tax threshold to be near
$52 million.</TE>
<TE>   At least another 13 of the league's 29 teams are expected to come
in above next year's luxury-tax ceiling. Laker owner Jerry Buss has
been a proponent of the luxury tax, which was designed to penalize
free-spending organizations and spread the overruns to those
franchises believed to be fiscally responsible, but it would seem
nearly impossible for the Lakers to remain below the tax line. And as
long as they'll be required to spend some extra money anyway, might
not they be inclined to spend even a bit more?</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, as they maneuver in the off-season to restock the
talent around O'Neal and Bryant, who next season will earn nearly $36
million combined, Buss might be more willing to upgrade his bench and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible, then, that the Lakers will spend their $4.5
million exception this off-season. It went untouched last summer,
when General Manager Mitch Kupchak persuaded Walker and Richmond to
sign at cut rates, and deftly added Hunter in the hours after
learning that Derek Fisher had suffered a second stress fracture in
his foot.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak would say only that he is satisfied with the composition
of the team, that he hopes to re-sign the young free agents, and that
there will be no reason to tamper with the success, now bordering on
a third consecutive championship.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to maintain our core," Kupchak said, "and replenish
around it."</TE>
<TE>   Where that leaves his free agents can't be known until July, when
negotiating begins, and George, Medvedenko, Walker and Shaw, in
particular, learn their market value.</TE>
<TE>   George, who had a strong regular season but has struggled in the
playoffs, said recently that he sensed his time with the Lakers was
running out. McCoy, who spent most of the season on the injured list,
probably would like to play more.</TE>
<TE>   Walker's value has risen, though he was slowed in the playoffs by
a bone bruise in his knee. He said he has five days after the last
game of the season to make his opt-out decision, and that meetings
with Kupchak and Jackson would play into it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to evaluate the situation," Walker said. "That five days
is going to be allocated to nothing but that."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Richmond, the six-time all-star who arrived with a
scoring average of 22.2 points and having played 21 playoff games. He
has hardly played for two months. Jackson's rotation tightened and
Shaw took most of the reserve minutes at shooting guard, even as
Richmond, at nearly 37, insisted he still had much to give.</TE>
<TE>   He said Monday he would like to return to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "If I stay, I think I'd play," he said. "Phil likes the guys with
a year under their belt. So, I'd consider it."</TE>
<TE>   Richmond has a home in Calabasas, where his family is happy and
settled. After years of stardom, a year off the bench wasn't half
bad, he said. If nothing else, he satisfied his curiosity about the
Lakers and about championship-type teams.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," he said, "it's everything I ever thought it would be.
It's been a fun and a happy time."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Reaching the NBA Finals has apparently become a consolation prize for
the Nets.</LD>
<LD>   They all but acknowledged Monday they have no hope of coming back
from a three-games-to-none deficit to defeat the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets know no team in NBA history has rebounded from three
games down to win. So, they moved to Plan B.</LD>
<TE>   "We can't think about a 3-0 deficit," point guard Jason Kidd said.
"We can only think about Game 4 [Wednesday].</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to get one on the board. Our objective now is
just to win one and take it from there."</TE>
<TE>   Forward Kenyon Martin said the Nets aren't resigned to starting
vacation on Thursday. He believes they will make matters difficult
for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to quit," he said. "We're going to try to force a
Game 5. We're not going to lie down. We can't roll over and die right
now, but it is kind of rough to think about right now."</TE>
<TE>   Martin disagreed with the notion that the Nets' lack of success in
the Finals has somehow overshadowed a franchise-record 52 victories
during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't expect us to be here," he said. "They
counted us out before the season and during the season. If it did
happen [a 4-0 series sweep by the Lakers], it wouldn't take away from
anything we accomplished this season."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a similar question, Kidd said, "We want to play it
out. We still have a lot to lose. We don't want to finish the season
on a sour note, knowing we didn't give 110% up until the end."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn had his best game of the Finals on Sunday, making
six of 14 shots and scoring 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   He made his first significant basket of the series, swishing a
jump shot that brought the Nets to within, 102-100, with 34 seconds
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn's solid performance happened one game after Net Coach
Byron Scott benched him for the fourth quarter of a 23-point loss.
Van Horn scored nine points on three-for-nine shooting in that game.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Van Horn wasn't on the floor at the end of Game 2, Scott
said, "To me, mentally, he wasn't in the game. So, in the fourth
quarter, I thought the guys who were playing hard and got us a chance
to come back were the guys I was going to stick with."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Greene returned from a 10-month absence Monday still looking
like the world's fastest man.</LD>
<LD>   The American sprinter blazed past big-name rivals in 9.97 seconds
to win the 100 meters at the Athens Grand Prix.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good to be back," Greene said. "I'm not pleased with the
time. But I have to be pleased with the race. It's my first race back
since Edmonton. My goal is to stay undefeated."</LD>
<TE>   Greene, 27, has been out of major competition because of an
injured leg since winning the world title in Canada last year. At
Athens, Greene beat American Bernard Williams and Britain's Dwain
Chambers, who were second and third in 10.06 and 10.08</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old woman who accused Oakland Raider defensive tackle
Darrell Russell of videotaping her being raped Jan. 31 by two of his
friends testified at Alameda that she blacked out after Russell mixed
her a drink.</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she vaguely remembered looking up at a working
video camera. The testimony came on the first day of a preliminary
hearing. Russell is charged with 25 felonies as an accomplice in the
alleged attack by Naeem Perry, 24, of Berkeley, and Ali Hayes, 27, of
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, a two-time Pro Bowl selection who is serving a one-year
NFL suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse policy, has
been free since posting bail. Under California law, Russell could be
found guilty of crimes committed by either of his two friends if he
did not intervene.</TE>

<TE>   Ryan Hollins, a 6-foot-11 center from Pasadena Muir High, has
committed to play basketball at UCLA less than a week after visiting
the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Hollins had signed with Saint Louis, but was granted a release

Romar recruited him again but Hollins chose the Bruins and will take
their last scholarship. Hollins is ineligible next season under
transfer rules, but he plans to appeal.</TE>

<HD>Hull's 100th Playoff Goal Puts Him in Elite Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Detroit winger Brett Hull joined a select number of players when he
scored his 100th playoff goal Monday night in the Red Wings' 3-0
victory over Carolina in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   Hull trails only Wayne Gretzky (122), Mark Messier (109) and Jari
Kurri (106) on the all-time list.</LD>
<LD>   "It's [special] in that I have joined quite a group and I am very
proud to be a part of it," said Hull, who scored his team-leading
10th playoff goal and recorded his 23rd postseason game-winning goal.
"I guess there was a time when there was talk that you could never
win in the playoffs with Brett Hull and all of a sudden you win a
Cup."</LD>
<TE>   Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said it's time people start looking at
Hull as one of the game's top all-time scorers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a pure goal scorer," Bowman said. "We know that he got his
10th goal tonight in a league where it's really tough to score."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe nearly faced more odd-man rushes
Monday than he did over the first three games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what kind of players are on the ice," Irbe said of the
talented Red Wings after he made 24 saves Monday. "Once the puck hits
that player, that's when I react and try to see their tendencies.
That's the only way to go about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit defenseman Jiri Fischer's third-period cross-check on
Carolina winger Tommy Westlund sent Westlund to the ice and bloodied
his face but no penalty was called.... Of the 26 teams that have led,
3-1, in the Stanley Cup finals, 25 have gone on to win the NHL
championship. The only time a team has overcome such a deficit to win
the Stanley Cup was in 1942 when Toronto rallied past Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Texas-based ticket broker has turned over 100 Stanley Cup finals
tickets to the state of North Carolina as part of a settlement of a
lawsuit filed last week by Roy Cooper, North Carolina's attorney
general.</TE>
<TE>   In a settlement signed over the weekend, Encore Tickets of Dallas
agreed to return all unsold tickets it had purchased to games between
the Carolina Hurricanes and the Detroit Red Wings. Cooper had filed a
lawsuit to stop ticket brokers from selling tickets at illegally
inflated prices. The 100 tickets will go to local charities. Cooper
said many tickets for the games, which sold out in less than an hour,
were bought by ticket companies, which resold the tickets for as much
as $1,000 each.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Nixon, a catcher from Phoenix Sunnyslope High, has signed with
the Dodgers for about $1 million and will not play football at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins had hoped the 6-foot-2, 210-pound safety would play
both sports, but Nixon decided to focus on baseball after the Dodgers
drafted him in the third round and gave him a signing bonus equal to
that of a late first-round pick.</LD>
<LD>   Nixon, who intercepted three passes and returned a fumble for a
touchdown in a high school all-star game Saturday, informed UCLA
coaches football is in his past.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll miss it, but I'm not going to look back at all," he said. "I
made my decision. If I have a bad game, I'm not going to think maybe
I should be playing football."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon will report to the Dodger rookie league team in Great Falls,
Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Another UCLA recruit at safety is weighing a pro baseball career.
Jarrad Page, a shortstop-outfielder from San Leandro High, was a
fifth-round pick of the Milwaukee Brewers.</TE>

<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The man who doesn't exist walks larger than life through the dank
hallways of the Goodwill Home and Mission, wearing a gold Laker
jersey adorned with, "O'Neal."</LD>
<LD>   The man who abandoned his second child awakens every morning in
his tiny, windowless room to photos of the boy on the wall and desk,
all grown up, giant and famous and gone.</LD>
<LD>   The man who has been purposely forgotten has put a message on his
answering machine that shows he will never forget.</LD>
<TE>   "Hi, this is Shaq ... " says the voice.</TE>
<TE>   That's not his name. But it was once his shame.</TE>
<TE>   And even as he tries to fix things from his place in the darkest
shadow of his son's greatest glory, Joseph Toney realizes it's much
too late.</TE>
<TE>   "It's finished, and it's God's will, and there's nothing more I
can do," he said softly.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Toney is Shaquille O'Neal's biological father.</TE>
<TE>   He lives and works in a Newark shelter 15 minutes from the
Continental Airlines Arena, where O'Neal will lead the Lakers against
the New Jersey Nets Wednesday in what could be a clinching Game 4 of
the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Toney has obtained a ticket on his own and will cheer for his son
but will not say hello.</TE>
<TE>   He has never said hello.</TE>
<TE>   They have never spoken.</TE>
<TE>   They have never even met.</TE>
<TE>   This is not by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Wondering how a father could leave his son when he was 6 months
old, O'Neal treats him as if he's dead.</TE>
<TE>   Claiming he lost contact only because he was in prison, then on
drugs, Toney says he is alive and sorry.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's people claim Toney is only looking for money and fame.</TE>
<TE>   Toney's people, who include his Goodwill employers, say he is
clean and sober and looking for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing certain is that these glorious days for a giant
hero have been painfully nicked with irony.</TE>
<TE>   This is O'Neal's triumphant homecoming to a Newark area where he
grew up and still maintains ties with as many as 200 relatives. Yet
his closest blood relation here is not welcome.</TE>
<TE>   This is a time when O'Neal's funky trademark smile is becoming the
NBA's logo. Yet the only man in the world who shares that smile
doesn't even know him.</TE>
<TE>   When asked Monday about his biological father, O'Neal smile turned
to stone.</TE>
<TE>   "No, it doesn't bother me at all," he said. "Because the man
doesn't even exist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "You want to see Shaq?"</TE>
<TE>   That is what the weary-eyed man behind the front desk of the
Goodwill Home and Mission says when you ask about Joseph Toney. That
is what they call him here.</TE>
<TE>   It's a place more about desperate hope than heroes, these brick
buildings lodged in a narrow street in downtown Newark, dozens of men
wandering around, the air thick with old sweat and mumbled promises.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of men come here claiming to have something special.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Toney has delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard he was Shaq's father, I took it with a grain of
salt," said Rich Callahan, director of ministries. "You hear a lot of
that sort of thing around here."</TE>
<TE>   But Toney, who checked in three years ago as just another
drug-addled soul, always kept a scrapbook. And in that scrapbook he
kept a birth certificate.</TE>
<TE>   He's only 6 feet 1, but he does have O'Neal's smile, and his lower
jaw, and even his slow gait.</TE>
<TE>   As Toney straightened up and became a member of the Goodwill
staff, driving a truck that delivered bread to homeless shelters, his
credibility increased and everyone believed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty amazing story," Callahan says.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Toney has occasionally shared that story with the
local newspaper, and he did so again last weekend. But with the
Lakers arriving in town for the middle games of the NBA Finals, the
news was too close for comfort.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning before Game 3 here, Phillip "Sarge" Harrison,
O'Neal's career Army stepfather, was inside the mission's hallways,
rapping on that front desk.</TE>
<TE>   He summoned Toney from his third-floor dormitory room and into the
street, where he repeated rules that he had set many years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled Toney: "He was upset and told me to stay away. I told
him, I didn't want anything. I never wanted anything."</TE>
<TE>   Said Harrison later: "Of course he wants something. If Shaquille
wasn't famous, we would have never heard from him. Why is he doing
this? Why?"</TE>
<TE>   Toney has asked himself that same question and, now that he has
been clean for three years, he says he has an answer.</TE>
<TE>   Said Toney: "Only one person can take a son away from you, and
that's God."</TE>
<TE>   Said Harrison: "I wish he'd just be quiet. All these years
ignoring his flesh and blood, and he shows up now?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Toney was a local basketball star. Lucille O'Neal worked
down at the local drug store. They dated for three years until O'Neal
graduated from high school.</TE>
<TE>   Then she became pregnant, just as Toney was turning to drugs.
Toney was in the hospital with her when she gave birth to Shaquille.
It was Toney who gave him the celebrated name.</TE>
<TE>   But soon, Toney was sent to federal prison in Lexington, Ky., on a
conviction involving fraudulent checks.</TE>
<TE>   The way he tells the story: "When I came back home six years
later, Lucille had already married Phillip, and I was out of the
picture."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison tells a different story.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came back from prison, I saw him in the park, and we
agreed that because he already had another child, I would be
Shaquille's dad and take care of him," Harrison said. "We even shook
hands on it."</TE>
<TE>   Toney said that while he agreed to give up parental rights, "I
never said I didn't want to see my son again."</TE>
<TE>   The years passed, O'Neal moved to a military base in Germany, and
Toney said all attempts to find him became fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   Said Toney: "Too much red tape."</TE>
<TE>   Said Harrison: "He never tried."</TE>
<TE>   Toney said he had given up, thinking his son would remain in
Germany indefinitely, until the day he recognized Shaquille on TV
during a high school all-star game.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a guy dunk and I heard them say his name and I said, 'Oh
my, that's him! That's my son! And look how big he is!' " Toney
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Toney said he tried to reach his son, phoning him at the
basketball office at Louisiana State. But he said the return call
came from Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   "He was really mad, told me to stay away," Toney recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Toney waited a couple of years until O'Neal played for the Orlando
Magic. He flew to Orlando, contacted his coaches, and was told to
wait for O'Neal near an exit after one of the games.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was standing there, they hustled Shaq out the other
exit," he said. "So he was trying to avoid me."</TE>
<TE>   He was. He still is.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, O'Neal poured out his hurt in a rap song,
"Biological Didn't Bother."</TE>
<TE>   Toney said this obvious pain is why he has finally stopped
bothering.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand their situation, I feel for them," Toney said.
"Phillip did a great job raising him. Probably a better job than I
would have done. Shaq seems to be a nice young man. Things have
turned out for the best."</TE>
<TE>   Toney said the only thing he wants is for his other two sons to
meet their half-brother. That is what he told Harrison. Harrison said
he would consider it.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand, it ain't those boys' fault," said Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   But as for Toney's involvement with his biological son, he has
about as much chance right now as the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   His friends may call him "Shaq," but he clearly once made the
choice to ignore that name. And now that the sports world is
celebrating it, he cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Said Toney: "I still feel that I had a part in creating one of the
greatest players in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Said Harrison: "Yeah. But he left him. Think about that. He left
him."</TE>

<HD>Will Phil Light Up a New Stogie for That Old Fogy?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The suggestion should have come from Red Auerbach, but instead came
in an e-mail from Grosario, a Laker fan back in Los Angeles: "Ask
Phil Jackson to light up a cigar when the championship game is about
to be won. I'll even pay for the cigar."</LD>
<LD>   I know for a fact Phil Jackson has the ability to blow smoke, but
he told me Tuesday he's never done it on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   I relayed Grosario's request, and Jackson smiled and said: "Yeah,
it's something to consider."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF THE Lakers' clinching victory were about to be achieved at
home, I'd have urged everyone to bring a cigar with them to Staples
Center, and at the proper time, light up and pay tribute to Jackson's
phenomenal success.</TE>
<TE>   (Anyone caught smoking anything else, of course, would probably be
mistaken for a Hollywood celebrity and given a better seat.)</TE>
<TE>   Although he resides most of the time atop Mt. Jackson, the guy who
is about to match Auerbach's mark of winning nine NBA titles as a
head coach probably still doesn't get the credit he deserves in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that comes from standing in line in public perception
behind Shaq, Kobe and Jerry West when it comes to putting the Lakers
back on the NBA map.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that comes from being known as Michael Jordan's coach,
forever linking the two of them with Chicago's rise to prominence in
the NBA. Some comes from appearing so standoffish.</TE>
<TE>   That's why I would like to see Jackson break step, go human and
surprise everyone. I'd like to see him light up a victory cigar on
the bench, maybe even singe his soul patch, Laker fans pointing and
giggling at their puffing coach on TV, and taking vicarious pleasure
in the team's three-peat dominance, and Jackson's part in making it
possible. Take a bow--nothing wrong with that.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's first title in L.A. was memorable for the comeback
against Portland. Last year's was memorable for Mark Madsen's dancing
at the victory parade.</TE>
<TE>   There has been nothing memorable about these NBA Finals, although
the series with the Kings has already inspired talk about next year's
meeting. I'd imagine seeing the Zen Master light a victory cigar and
blow smoke in the direction of Sacramento would be remembered by some
people.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT STILL might take a four-peat to make Jackson bigger than Pat
Riley in Laker lore, and looked upon as more L.A. than Chicago. I
have no idea what Jeanie is waiting for, but I also have no idea if
there is a question that needs to be answered.</TE>
<TE>   I know this. He's already shown an uncanny ability to make sure
his team doesn't win too many games and force him to coach in the
All-Star Game. You try to do that with Shaq and Kobe on your team. He
does not fret over losing the home-court advantage, and you try to
lose that with Kobe and Shaq on your team.</TE>
<TE>   You criticize this guy, and he'll go out and win the championship
on you. I know one sports columnist in town who had him one game away
from losing it all a week or so ago, and now Jackson is one win away
from going back to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Add another NBA title to his resume next year, and although it
will probably spark an argument from reverential old-timers, it could
very well put him in a coaching stratosphere occupied by only the
bigger-than-life likes of Vince Lombardi, John Wooden and Casey
Stengel. One more playoff win, and he will have more career victories
in postseason play than Riley, and he has already won 155 of the 209
games he's coached under that kind of pressure.</TE>
<TE>   At the rate Byron Scott is going, I don't think he's going to be
the one to catch him. If Auerbach has any beef, it should be that he
never had the chance to coach against Scott and the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKSON SAID he received word through a third party from Auerbach
that the former Celtic coach was misquoted in reports that he made
light of Jackson's accomplishments. I heard Auerbach on the radio,
and he was still pecking away at Jackson's success. The classy thing,
of course, would be for Auerbach to send Jackson a cigar--instead of
making Grosario pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, Grosario, I'll be sending you a bill for that cigar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITH THE Finals no longer in doubt, the biggest mystery is what
jersey Kobe will wear after the clinching win. "Wait until you see
what I've got," he teased.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe wore an Edmonton Oiler Wayne Gretzky jersey after Game 3, and
said Gretzky agreed to autograph it for good luck. He's worn Jackie
Robinson's jersey, Derek Jeter's, Pedro Martinez's and Joe Namath's
among others.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked him whose jersey he was going to wear next, he said,
"He's the greatest of them all." Does he have a Michael Jordan
jersey? "Of course," he said, "you can't have a jersey collection
without Jordan.''</TE>
<TE>   Shaq said Kobe respects his father and West the most, but Kobe has
already worn both of their jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   There's Dr. J, Magic and Lisa Leslie, but I'm told he confided to
a teammate he will not be wearing the jersey of a basketball player.
I can't believe it's Pele.</TE>
<TE>   If he really is talking about the "greatest" of them all, I guess
that means he'll be showing up in a bathrobe with Muhammad Ali's name
on his back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Numa Gomez:</TE>
<TE>   "You better be careful getting those people upset and blaming it
on [columnist] Bill Plaschke. I'd hate to wake up one morning and
read the headline: 'Plaschke Sleeps with the Fishes. '"</TE>
<TE>   At least for a change he wouldn't be the one writing the sob
story.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings a Step Away From Title</HD>
<DH>Stanley Cup finals: Hasek gets his sixth shutout of
playoffs, and smothering defense doesn't give Carolina an opening in
Detroit's 3-0 win in Game 4.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>With a nasty cut on his lip and several body bruises in need of ice
packs, former King Luc Robitaille walked out of the Detroit Red
Wings' dressing room Monday night with a huge smile on his face.</LD>
<LD>   It may not be that unusual to see Robitaille smiling, but his face
had a look it had never had. Being one victory away from your first
Stanley Cup championship can do that for a veteran hockey player.</LD>
<LD>   "The next two days are going to be fun," said Robitaille after the
Red Wings defeated Carolina, 3-0, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals
in front of a capacity crowd of 18,986 at Entertainment and Sports
Arena. "I have been getting calls from a ton of friends wishing me
luck. I realize that we still have another win to go, but it's a good
feeling to know that we're so close."</LD>
<TE>   Brett Hull scored in the second period for his 10th goal of this
year's playoffs and 100th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Then, veterans Igor Larionov and Brendan Shanahan added
third-period scores for Detroit, which swept both games at Carolina
to take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   After 16 years in the NHL, including 12 in Los Angeles, Robitaille
is one victory from achieving his lifetime goal of getting his name
on the Stanley Cup, and he doesn't care that he has been held without
a goal in the finals.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I came to Detroit," said Robitaille, who picked up an
assist Monday but has only four goals and nine points in 22 playoff
games with the Red Wings, the team he signed with as a free agent
last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much talent in our locker room that everyone is about
playing the team game. They don't need me to score every night
because everyone contributes."</TE>
<TE>   That was the case Monday as the Red Wings played their best
defense of the series, two days after winning a five-hour,
triple-overtime game, 3-2, on a goal by Larionov in the third-longest
game in Stanley Cup finals history.</TE>
<TE>   "[Detroit's defense] makes excellent outlet plays, they move that
puck so well from their back end," Carolina Coach Paul Maurice said.
"They play a really good five-man defensive game. [Their defense] is
so overlooked because it's far more fun for everybody to look at the
goals that are scored and the people that put the puck in the net."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit goaltender Dominik Hasek frustrated the Hurricanes all
night, making 17 saves to record his sixth shutout of the playoffs.
The Red Wings are 11-1 in their last 12 Stanley Cup finals games.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, Hull joined Wayne Gretzky, Mark
Messier and Jari Kurri as the only players to score at least 100
playoff goals when he beat Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe 6:32 into
the second.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit forward Boyd Devereaux made the play to set up the goal
when he carried the puck into the Hurricanes' zone and then found
Hull by the left circle. From there, Hull knew what to do as he beat
Irbe with a one-timer.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the third period, the Red Wings scored when defenseman
Jiri Fischer faked a shot from the blue line and passed to a
wide-open Larionov, who recorded his fifth goal of the playoffs at
3:43.</TE>
<TE>   With 5:17 remaining, Shanahan scored his first goal of this year's
Stanley Cup finals off an assist from Sergei Fedorov.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina had a couple of great chances to score on Hasek, but the
Detroit goalie either made the save or the Hurricanes hit a post.</TE>
<TE>   In the first period, Carolina forward Erik Cole had a breakaway
down the left wing, but Hasek skated at least 12 feet away from his
net to swat the puck with his stick before Cole could get off a shot.</TE>
<TE>   In the second period, Carolina's Jeff O'Neill made a perfect setup
pass to captain Ron Francis outside the crease, but the Hurricane
captain's shot hit the left post.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit, which improved to 10-0 when leading after two periods in
the playoffs, limited the Hurricanes to four shots in the third
period.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Carolina is one game from being eliminated, the Red
Wings are not counting them out when the teams meet for Game 5 at Joe
Louis Arena on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that it's not over," Detroit forward Kris Draper said.
"That team doesn't have any quit.... They are going to do everything
they can to force a Game 6 back here in Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the fourth one is the toughest one to win."</TE>
<TE>   Irbe played well on Monday but not good enough on a night when the
Hurricanes' offense was shut down by the Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to be more aggressive on the offensive end and get more
pucks to the net," Cole said. "The players for Detroit have done a
good job of taking away the shooting range. It's where one guy kind
of sits back and takes away the lanes and the other really pressures
you up high. Their defensemen have made the adjustments, and I think
they are really doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Good enough to be one victory away from the franchise's 10th
Stanley Cup title.</TE>

<HD>Only Laker Boredom Can Help the Nets Now</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am not ashamed to say that I was a New York Net fan growing up. It
was always a special day whenever I got a chance to travel from my
home in New Jersey to Long Island's Nassau Coliseum to watch Dr. J
and his afro dominate the court.</LD>
<LD>   It's too bad Julius Erving can't help the Nets now.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the Lakers slack off and just go through the motions on
Wednesday, New Jersey's first appearance in the NBA Finals will be a
short one. Shaquille O'Neal is simply too dominant and Kobe Bryant is
too good for the Lakers to lose to the Nets, who have tried nearly
everything to prevent a four-game sweep in the best-of-seven series.</LD>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson, who had to work up a sweat coaching
against San Antonio and Sacramento, has been in cruise control in the
Finals. With O'Neal and Bryant on top of their games, the Laker role
players have had an easy time making contributions, making Jackson's
job simple.</TE>
<TE>   It has been the opposite for New Jersey Coach Byron Scott, who has
been learning as much as his players. Scott may have a few more
twists to throw at the Lakers but the key to Wednesday will be O'Neal
&amp; Co.'s mental approach. If the Lakers come ready to play, there's
not much the Nets can do. A breakdown of Game 4:</TE>
<TE>   NETS' MOVE--Jason Kidd showed why he's so dangerous with a great
second-half effort on Sunday. With Scott going with a smaller lineup,
which included Richard Jefferson at forward, New Jersey was able to
play an up-tempo game. The Nets attempted 83 field goals compared to
the Lakers' 68. That has to happen again for New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's decision to play a more aggressive match-up zone worked
well in Game 3, especially when he had his quicker players on the
floor. The Nets not only forced the Lakers into 19 turnovers but they
also did a great job scrambling out of double-teams. New Jersey
should throw every half-court trap in the book at the Lakers on
Wednesday. The more times O'Neal has to handle the ball outside the
paint, the better for the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   It was good to see Kenyon Martin get his game going with 26 points
on Sunday, but he still has to rebound better. Grabbing only four
rebounds in 43 minutes, as Martin did in Game 3, does not get the job
done for an NBA power forward. The Nets, who were outrebounded by the
Lakers, 40-27, did not have anyone with more than five rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   They could sure use Erving, who averaged 37.6 points and 14.2
rebounds and shot 60% from the field in his last ABA Finals
appearance with the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--The best thing about their 106-103 victory on Sunday
was not O'Neal and Bryant combining for 71 points but Derek Fisher's
13. When New Jersey decided to collapse around O'Neal early, Fisher
made the Nets pay with nine points in the first quarter. Although he
only scored four more points afterward, Fisher played with confidence
the rest of the game. After an up-and-down playoff season, expect
Fisher to play with the same self-assurance in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers should execute better against the Nets' match-up zone
in Game 4. Bryant had six turnovers because he struggled seeing the
double-team. But once he got used to the trap in the fourth quarter,
he ate New Jersey up for 12 of his 36 points. Look for him to be even
sharper against the Nets' traps on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be surprise to see the Lakers try to trap Kidd more than
they have over the first three games. Jackson understands that Kidd
is the catalyst behind the Nets and that the Lakers need to keep him
under wraps. If Kerry Kittles and Lucious Harris continue to struggle
shooting as they did on Sunday (nine points combined), Bryant will
probably defend Kidd more.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--Give Jackson credit for sticking with backup swingman
Devean George, who has only made 16.1% (five of 31) of his
three-point shots in the playoffs. George has become a valuable
defender and energy source off the bench for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter of Game 3, George stepped up with a
team-high six rebounds and scored all six of his points.</TE>
<TE>   George may be almost a year older than Bryant but he's a youngster
when it comes to playoff pressure.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it is so great to see George producing now.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>History beckons.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it will be goalkeeper Brad Friedel who answers the call
with another standout game against Poland, or the Mohawk-cropped
Clint Mathis who replies with another goal out of nowhere, only time
will tell.</LD>
<LD>   What is known is that the United States battled South Korea to a
1-1 tie Monday in front of an enthralled throng of 60,778 at the
Daegu World Cup Stadium, where Friedel saved a penalty kick, Mathis
scored in his World Cup debut and each team walked out of the stadium
with honor satisfied.</LD>
<TE>   When Portugal plundered Poland, 4-0, in the rain in Jeonju, South
Korea, later Monday night, the U.S. was positioned to reach the
second round--if it can tie or beat the Poles in Daejeon, South
Korea, on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans have visited that lofty plateau only twice before in
their soccer history--in 1930 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "We're feeling good," said captain Claudio Reyna. "Our spirits
were high in the locker room. We were really happy with that point.
We have one more [first-round] game left, and we're in a great
position to get through.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's definitely not over. On the last day, in the third game,
strange things happen. So until it's over, we have to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   The Poles will have nothing to lose because Monday's loss ended
their hopes of advancing. "We've got a hard game against Poland, and
we know that," Friedel said. "We'll have our heads screwed on
straight and be ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   Friedel was more than ready Monday. He faced a barrage of 19 shots
from the South Koreans, 10 of them on target, but it was his save on
Lee Eul Yong's 40th-minute penalty kick that kept the U.S. in
control. The kick was awarded by Swiss referee Urs Meier, who ruled
that defender Jeff Agoos had fouled South Korean forward Hwang Sun
Hong. Lee stepped up to take the shot but failed to hit it where
Friedel wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had a feeling he was going to go that way," Friedel said.
"I think they switched shooters. That always makes me feel a little
better because it tells me one of them wasn't really looking forward
to taking a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was stepping up to the ball, I thought he was going to go
to that side. I gave a little bit of a fake, like I was going left,
and returned back to the middle. I was fortunate enough that he put
it in my reach."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis had made no such mistake when presented with a scoring
opportunity in the 24th minute.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. goal was created out of almost nothing by midfielder John
O'Brien, who took possession at midfield, made a run toward the South
Korean net and then lofted a perfect pass over the head of defender
Hong Myung Bo and into the path of Mathis, who timed his run
perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis controlled the ball with his right foot, allowed it to
bounce once and then unleashed a left-foot shot that flew straight
and true into the lower right corner of the South Korean net.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Choi Jin Cheul arrived a split second too late.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know there was a defender coming in on the blind
side until I saw the replay," Mathis said. "I didn't know if I was
offside, you couldn't hear the whistle blowing or anything. I wanted
to finish the play off just in case.</TE>
<TE>   "Luckily, I was able to get a good shot and put it in the corner.
I took the shot off my first touch, else I probably would have lost
the opportunity to shoot."</TE>
<TE>   The praise was swift in coming.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great finish," fellow striker Brian McBride said. "All
around. His run to stay on side, the ball from Johnny [O'Brien], his
first touch and then the calmness and coolness [of the finish].</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien was quick to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a clinical finisher," he said. "If you look at the replay,
it was just a great goal. He touches it with his right foot, it
bounces once and he strikes it right in the corner with his left
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Like the rest of the U.S. players, O'Brien was delighted that the
U.S., after losing all three games at the France '98 World Cup, is
unbeaten after two games at Korea/Japan '02.</TE>
<TE>   "Four points after two games, that's not a bad situation," he
said. "We felt during the game we could maybe have six, but we've got
to be happy with four."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena certainly was.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had asked most people months ago whether the U.S. would
have four points after its first two matches, I think 100% of them
would have said no," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take it and get out of town real quick and get our
team prepared for a very difficult opponent in Poland."</TE>
<TE>   To the enormous relief and delight of its fans, South Korea
finally found a way to beat Friedel in the 78th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Awarded a free kick at midfield after Landon Donovan had brought
Lee down with a tackle from behind, South Korea took full advantage.
Lee floated the ball toward the far post and Ahn Jung Hwan out-jumped
Agoos to head the ball into the right corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a ball played in between the defense and myself," Friedel
explained. "Both teams were tired at the end, and I think we lost
concentration for a split second, and they put it away."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea Coach Guus Hiddink had mixed emotions about the
result. He was pleased that his team had been able to come back and
gain the tie. Yet he believed South Korea should have won.</TE>
<TE>   "We created five, six, seven [scoring] chances," he said. "The
goalie [Friedel] was tremendous, but at the international level, from
that many chances we should have scored at least once [more]."</TE>
<TE>   By far the best chance arose in the 89th minute, when Lee took a
back-heel pass from Ahn and raced to the end line before cutting the
ball back to Choi Sung Yong, who had only Friedel to beat from six
yards to give South Korea a goal and all but assure it a place in the
second round with a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly for Choi, he blasted the ball high over the bar, and South
Korea faces the unpleasant prospect of having to tie or defeat the
surging Portuguese if it hopes to avoid becoming the first host
nation in World Cup history to fail to reach the second round.</TE>
<TE>   History beckons.</TE>

<HD>Ahn Shows His Icy Demeanor</HD>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>When Ahn Jung Hwan scored the tying goal for South Korea on Monday
against the United States, his reaction was immediate.</LD>
<LD>   The forward raced to the corner flag and went into a peculiar
crouch, curling his left arm behind his back and pumping his legs,
not unlike an Olympic short-track speedskater. That was exactly Ahn's
intention.</LD>
<LD>   The display, not at all impromptu, was in honor of South Korean
skater Kim Dong-Sung, who, many Koreans believe, was robbed of a gold
medal at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics when judges disqualified
him in the 1,500-meter race for allegedly impeding U.S. skater Apolo
Anton Ohno.</LD>
<TE>   Ohno was awarded the gold and South Korea has harbored a sporting
grudge ever since. Kim had intended to be at Monday's game, but opted
out, one of his sponsors said, because of "concerns that his presence
at the stadium would arouse anti-American feelings among the
audience."</TE>
<TE>   Ahn walked through the post-game mixed zone without fielding
reporters' questions about his goal or his subsequent celebration.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clint "Mohawk" Mathis was asked why he had shaved his head,
leaving the distinctive strip down the middle, which he dyed brown,
then spiked.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," he replied. "You get bored, sometimes, when you
don't get to leave your hotel room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Claudio Reyna was worried before the game that because
he was coming off a thigh injury he might not be able to last.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start a match, you have to plan to go for 90 minutes, so
hopefully I can," he said a couple of days before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he said he is fine and ready to play against Poland on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," he said. "I haven't played since the Holland game
[in Foxboro, Mass., on May 19] and there was probably a week that I
didn't train at all, so I was happy with my fitness, and running
around was good. Adrenaline kept me going for a while. I was hoping
it would and it kind of worked out, so I'm happy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The heat that was supposed to have a negative impact on the U.S.
team's performance never showed up. The game was played under
overcast skies and cooled by a breeze that kept the temperature at a
reasonably comfortable 77 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It was warm out there," goalkeeper Brad Friedel said, "but we
were quite thankful that there was a lot of cloud cover because it
was a lot more warm and humid than in Seoul where we've been
training."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig Von Beethoven, as far as is known, never saw a soccer game,
but his music made an appearance Monday. Music by Beethoven, lyrics
by South Korea's fans, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, with the score tied and South Korea pushing for
the victory, the fans in Daegu Stadium tried to lift their team even
further by singing to the tune of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   On an afternoon when the atmosphere was tremendous throughout, it
made for the perfect ending.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By bringing Eddie Lewis and Josh Wolff on as second-half
substitutes, Coach Bruce Arena increased the number of American
players who have appeared in this World Cup to 18.</TE>
<TE>   Only defenders Gregg Berhalter, Steve Cherundolo and David Regis,
and goalkeepers Kasey Keller and Tony Meola have not played so far.</TE>

<LD>Well, he had his chance.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal was up on the podium at Continental Airlines
Arena, the room in hushed anticipation of even his most banal
remarks, and he was given the chance to put his team--his era--in its
proper place.</LD>
<LD>   He could have gone for it all, proclaiming this Laker team--his
Laker team--the greatest that ever was, and nobody would have
flinched. He could have made a bold declaration that he is what
separates this L.A. team from all the rest that came before, and that
their dominance of the last three postseasons proves it, end of
story.</LD>
<TE>   He ... declined.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will put us up there," Shaq said simply. "You know,
we've been together a long time. We've been through a lot of hard
times, more good times than hard times. But I think it will put us
right up there with all the other great teams. It will be a big
accomplishment for Phil [Jackson], a big accomplishment for myself, a
big accomplishment for the city.... But it's not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm done, that will be enough at that time. But right now,
it's not enough."</TE>
<TE>   It seems that it's not enough for anybody else, either. Not yet.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Shaq has arrived at this conclusion either through
modesty or greed: He wants more, and only after he gets it will he
place himself among the pantheon of legends. Only then will he play
the comparison game, only then will he dare place his name alongside
those of Russell and Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Kobe Bryant today what he saw beyond this year," said
Jack Ramsay, the ESPN analyst. "And what he said impressed me: He's
already talked to his other guys--Shaq, Robert Horry, Rick Fox--about
working out this summer. They didn't do that last year. But now
they're thinking in those terms, thinking about pushing this as far
as they can go.</TE>
<TE>   "So we're going to find out. But this team, right now, if you're
comparing it with the all-time great teams, it's not there yet. They
seem to know you have to have longevity. They're getting there,
though."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Riley spent Monday on an L.A. beach, which put him in a mood
for California Dreaming.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this L.A. team's greatness is born out of a combination of
talent and system," said the coach of the first Laker dynasty. "The
system transcends the ability. I think our Lakers team in the '80s
was a lot deeper and more talented. But take Shaq's dominance and
Kobe's versatility, and add an X-factor--the system--you have
something special. What Phil has put in--the way they balance the
floor and have everyone ready to shoot--you see the system is just as
important as the greatness of the players."</TE>
<TE>   A pause. "But I think our '87 team was better," he added.</TE>

<HD>Spencer Slams Door on Arizona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Late in the game, crowd going crazy. The Arizona Diamondbacks trying
to protect a lead at Yankee Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   It happened again--only this time Arizona didn't need closer
Byung-Hyun Kim to blow it.</LD>
<LD>   Shane Spencer hit a two-out grand slam in the eighth inning Monday
night and the New York Yankees rallied past Arizona, 7-5, in a
rematch of last year's World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's weird," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "It really is
weird."</TE>
<TE>   Spencer homered on a full-count pitch from Bret Prinz after the
Yankees chased Randy Johnson (9-2) earlier in the inning. An
intentional walk set up Spencer's full-count shot that overcame a 4-3
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 45,698 that already had seen a remarkable home run by
rookie Marcus Thames--he homered on his first major league pitch,
against Johnson--roared as Spencer rounded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, these fans at Yankee Stadium had seen similar things.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, New York won Games 4 and 5 of the World Series with
dramatic homers against Kim. Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius--no
longer with the Yankees--and Derek Jeter all went deep.</TE>
<TE>   Add Spencer to the list.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately for them, it happened that way," Spencer said. "Not
quite as dramatic as the World Series. The atmosphere was a little
different."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez, booed for his Game 7 heroics, and Tony Womack
delivered key hits as NL West-leading Arizona tried to win its fifth
in a row. But the Diamondbacks remained winless at Yankee Stadium
after dropping all three World Series games in the Bronx last year.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was not as dominant as he was when he defeated the Yankees
three times in the Series, including a victory in relief in Game 7.
But the Big Unit still struck out eight, moving past Hall of Famer
Gaylord Perry for seventh on the career list with 3,535.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson made his first start at Yankee Stadium in seven years and
his first appearance at the park since 1996. He's 6-8 lifetime
against the Yankees in the regular season, but is 5-0 against them in
postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was just another game, honestly," the Series co-most
valuable player said.</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Jason Giambi drew a one-out walk and Jorge Posada
doubled. With two out, Prinz relieved Johnson and intentionally
walked pinch-hitter Robin Ventura before Spencer hit his fourth
career slam.</TE>
<TE>   "You go with your best pitch," Prinz said. "I just didn't
execute."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Stanton (3-0) gave up Chris Donnels' solo homer in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Thames, promoted from triple-A Columbus before the game, provided
the early excitement with a smashing debut.</TE>
<TE>   Thames became only the second player in Yankee history to homer in
his first at-bat, hitting a two-run shot over the left-field wall. He
became the 17th player to homer on his first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," Thames said. "I walked to the plate and
put my head down. If I'd looked at Randy, I would've been more
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   With bench coach Don Zimmer and other Yankees laughing in
amazement, Thames came out of the dugout for a curtain call.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Torre pushed me out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thames got another big ovation from the fans when he trotted to
his position in right field after the inning ended. After the game,
teammate Alberto Castillo gave Thames a shaving-cream pie in the
face.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't mind at all," Thames said.</TE>
<TE>   Many players have homered in their first at-bat in the majors. St.
Louis pitcher Gene Stechschulte (2001) was the last to do it, and
Tampa Bay pitcher Esteban Yan (2000) was the last to accomplish the
feat in the AL, both coming on the first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   John Miller (1966) is the other Yankee to connect in his first
at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley's two-run double tied the score in the fourth. In the
fifth, Womack led off with a double and eventually set up run-scoring
singles by Junior Spivey and Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in Game 7, Womack's run-scoring double keyed a two-run
rally in the bottom of the ninth against Mariano Rivera, a comeback
capped by Gonzalez's bloop single.</TE>

<LD>A training academy for deputies and firefighters, a performing arts
center and new athletic fields may be among the first projects funded
by the Ventura County Community College District's $356-million
construction bond.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last several weeks, officials at the district and the
three college campuses have been working to finalize the list of
capital projects to be financed through the initial bond issue, which
will total $105 million, said J. Handel Evans, the district's bond
management consultant.</LD>
<LD>   The priority projects include the $12.6-million performing arts
center at Oxnard College, the $6.3-million athletic upgrades at
Ventura College, a $15-million computer center and more parking
spaces for Moorpark College students, $12 million worth of
infrastructure work and a new student services building at Oxnard
College and a $4.6-million renovation of Ventura College's
auditorium, according to the list.</LD>
<TE>   "The bond was designed, in many ways, to solve problems," Evans
said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the $105 million will allow the district to begin, but not
necessarily complete, work on 37 of the 62 projects that were
included on the bond measure approved by county voters in March.</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to break the bond program into four, two-year
phases, and construction on most of the projects is not expected to
begin until the second phase, Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 37 projects, 15 are planned at Moorpark College, 13 at
Ventura College and six at Oxnard College. The $22.6-million training
facilities for firefighters and sheriff's deputies and modernization
of the district's headquarters constitute the remaining projects.</TE>
<TE>   Evans cautioned that the list, which must be approved by the
district's governing board, could still change, as could the amount
dedicated to each project.</TE>

district's headquarters constitute the remaining projects.</TE>
<TE>   Plans Could Change</TE>
<TE>   Evans cautioned that the list, which must be approved by the
district's governing board, could still change, as could the amount
dedicated to each project.</TE>
<TE>   According to Moorpark College President James Walker, the projects
that made the opening round at his campus weren't necessarily the
most critical.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, the college chose to begin with the ones that
were the most feasible or unlikely to disrupt their campuses, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The projects in the first go-around are ones that don't require a
holistic look at the campus and can be done very soon," he said.
"When we do some of these is very critical because you don't want to
take on a project that is going to upset your educational process to
the point where you lose students."</TE>
<TE>   At Moorpark, bond funds are being sought for construction of a
satellite center in Thousand Oaks to be operated jointly with the
Conejo Valley Unified School District, as well as planning work on a
new child development center and a health science/math building.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street Meeting</TE>
<TE>   The naming of the projects came as college district officials went
to Wall Street on Monday seeking to fund the first phase of the
voter-approved bond. A delegation that included Chancellor Phillip
Westin, Deputy Chancellor Michael Gregoryk and Trustee Bob Gonzales
met with analysts from two New York bond-rating agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings, in which the district presented data on its
enrollment and financial health, were required so that analysts could
rate the bonds and set the interest rate bondholders will receive,
said district spokeswoman Pat Kistler.</TE>
<TE>   Pending approval by the rating agencies, the first set of bonds
will be sold next month, Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Effects on Taxpayer</TE>
<TE>   Evans said the amount of money the district is borrowing through
the first bond issue was set with the goal of minimizing the effect
on the property owners whose taxes will repay the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Although officials have estimated that the bond would cost
taxpayers an average of $18.97 per $100,000 of assessed value over
the life of the program, the amount that property owners see when
they get their next tax bills in late October could be less than
that, Evans said.</TE>

<HD>Westerfield Acted 'Creepy,' Witness Says</HD>
<DH>Court: Woman describes behavior of the suspect in the
death of Danielle van Dam. She and the victim's mother saw him in a
bar before the crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A female friend of Brenda and Damon van Dam testified Monday that the
man accused of killing the couple's daughter was acting "creepy" at a
neighborhood bar in the hours before the girl disappeared from their
home.</LD>
<LD>   Denise Kemal, 28, a flight attendant, said that defendant David
Westerfield bought drinks for her, Brenda van Dam and Barbara Easton
soon after they arrived at Dad's Cafe and Steakhouse on the night of
Feb. 1. The women were there for a "girls' night out" of drinking,
dancing and smoking marijuana.</LD>
<LD>   "Women don't buy their own drinks here," Kemal quoted Westerfield
as saying, when he first approached the women.</LD>
<TE>   Sending an angry glare toward Westerfield, Kemal said he later
stared at the three women as they danced and played pool with other
men.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very quiet and weird," Kemal said in a soft voice. "He was
creepy. He didn't say anything at all."</TE>
<TE>   After an objection from defense attorney Steven Feldman, Superior
Court Judge William Mudd told the jury to disregard Kemal's
statement.</TE>
<TE>   But on the next question from Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek, Kemal
gave a similar answer when asked about Westerfield: "I thought to
myself, 'Wow, that's creepy. Just standing there and watching.' "
This time, Feldman did not object.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, is accused of
kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam, whose nude and decomposing
body was found Feb. 27 in a rural area. He could face the death
penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield left the bar, sneaked into the
Van Dam home and kidnapped Danielle from her bedroom while her father
slept in an adjacent room. Before his arrest, Westerfield lived two
doors away from the Van Dams in the upscale Sabre Springs
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony from Kemal and Brenda van Dam indicated that, while
Westerfield was interested in getting to know the women, other men at
the bar were more successful in striking up a conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Kemal testified that she, Brenda van Dam and Easton had smoked
marijuana at the Van Dam home before they left for the bar-restaurant
and later took a break from dancing to smoke more marijuana while
sitting in a truck, listening to music and singing.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 2 a.m., the three women returned to the Van Dam
home, Kemal said. Brenda van Dam noticed that the red light was lit
on the family's burglary alarm, indicating an open door in the home,
Kemal said.</TE>
<TE>   Kemal said she and Brenda van Dam searched the home and found an
outside door in the garage was "wide open."</TE>
<TE>   Kemal, her confident demeanor shaken momentarily, said she had
opened that door several hours earlier when the three women were
smoking marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that Westerfield may have gained access to the
home through that door. The child was found missing about 9 a.m. Feb.
2.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony, guided by prosecutor Dusek, is meant to show that
Westerfield had been spurned by Van Dam and her friends in the hours
before he allegedly committed the crime. Dusek sought to show that
Westerfield had left the bar at least two hours before the women.</TE>
<TE>   Garry Harvey, a friend of Westerfield's, testified that
Westerfield left between 11 p.m. and midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman, in an effort to undermine the credibility of Kemal, asked
her why she had not told police that she previously had a sexual
relationship with the Van Dams. Kemal replied that her sexual
encounter was with Damon, not Brenda.</TE>
<TE>   And she rejected Feldman's suggestion that the encounter, which
occurred after a Halloween party at the Van Dam home, could be
described as "risque."</TE>
<TE>   "It was more of a swap," said Kemal, explaining that she had sex
with Damon, while her then-husband had sex with Brenda.</TE>
<TE>   She added that she did not tell police investigating Danielle's
disappearance about the sexual relationship in October 2000 because
"going so far back I didn't think it pertained."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time during the five days of trial, Westerfield
deviated from a stoic demeanor. He smiled broadly as Yvette Wetly, a
bartender at another suburban bar, pointed him out as a former
patron.</TE>

<HD>Senate Advances Paid Family Leave Bill</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Compensation would come from state disability
fund. Business groups oppose measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Legislation that would make California the first state
to promise disability pay for workers who take time off to care for
an ill family member or to welcome a newborn into the world was
passed Monday by the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Many states, including California, authorize unpaid leave for
employees to tend to family crises, but none provides compensation
for doing so, backers of the bill said.</LD>
<LD>   Under the plan, the state disability insurance program would
provide partial replacement compensation for up to 12 weeks of income
forfeited when someone leaves work to participate in a "temporary
family disability" case.</LD>
<TE>   Starting in 2004, weekly payments would range from $50 to $490 and
be capped at 55% of earnings during the covered period. The bill
would split the higher costs of the new benefits between employees
and their employers, with the total cost of premiums estimated at
$662 million for the first two years.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the bill said about 13 million Californians would be
eligible to participate, although they presented no estimates of how
many would claim the benefit in a given year.</TE>
<TE>   Those who do would receive benefits for up to 12 weeks to care for
a "seriously ill child, spouse, parent or domestic partner or to bond
with a newborn infant."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Employment Development has estimated that
in its first two years of operation, the paid family leave benefits
would total $217 million. The department also said that in the same
period, employers would pay $220 million and workers would contribute
$442 million.</TE>
<TE>   On a near party-line vote, Democrats prevailed over Republicans,
21 to 15, to send the bill to the Assembly. One Democrat, Sen. Jim
Costa of Fresno, joined with GOP members in opposing the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Approval of the bill (SB 1661), by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica), represented a win for organized labor, which had fought for
a paid family leave law for years but was turned aside by former
Republican Govs. Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl said Gov. Gray Davis, who has sought to be friendly with
both labor and corporate leaders as he campaigns for a second term,
has not taken a position on her bill.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the paid family leave plan include such major
employer organizations as the California Chamber of Commerce and the
Manufacturers and Technology Assn., and operators of restaurants,
hospitals and some grocery markets.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the California Labor Assn., AFL-CIO, sponsor of the
bill, supporters include labor unions, physicians, senior citizens,
teachers and child-care groups.</TE>
<TE>   Several other states are looking at enacting a paid family leave
law, but none has yet done so, said labor union representatives and a
spokeswoman for Kuehl.</TE>
<TE>   During floor debate, Kuehl noted that the current unpaid leave
policy, which was praised only a few years ago as a breakthrough for
family values, had failed to attract many participants because they
cannot afford to give up their earnings while they tend to family
situations. She said compensation from the state disability fund
would at least partly offset their loss of income.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, state disability insurance is financed by employee
contributions. Under the bill, employers for the first time would
contribute half of the additional premium costs, about $1.60 a month
each for the average worker and typical employer, Kuehl said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside), who led the GOP opposition,
complained that the Legislature was told when it adopted the unpaid
family leave law that its backers would never return with a paid
leave bill. He said Democrats now had offered just such a bill, which
he called "a tax on jobs."</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Lift Limits on Abuse Suits</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Attorneys and Catholic Church officials say
temporary change in law could trigger more allegations of molestation
by priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic officials and plaintiff attorneys expect a flood of
lawsuits against the church's 12 California dioceses if the
Legislature passes a bill that would make it easier for victims of
long-ago childhood sexual abuse to sue.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, unanimously passed by the state Senate last month and
now being considered by the Assembly, applies to any institution or
company where a known molester continued to work and went on to abuse
another child. However, it was drafted in direct response to the
ongoing Catholic Church abuse scandal, in which many victims have had
old molestation incidents thrown out of court by the statute of
limitations.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would give these victims a second chance by suspending
the statute of limitations for one year, beginning in January.
Regardless of when the abuse occurred, accusers could file suit
against the church during 2003 if the hierarchy "knew or had reason
to know" about a priest's sexual misconduct and "failed to take
reasonable steps to avoid similar, future acts."</LD>
<TE>   "This legislation is huge for victims," said John Manly, a Costa
Mesa attorney. He said a number of his clients would be able to file
suits under the proposed law.</TE>
<TE>   "It will enable them to right the wrongs the church has knowingly
perpetrated for the last 40 years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of public pressure, the bill hasn't faced any formal
opposition. But some Catholic officials wonder if, by removing the
statute of limitations for a year, the pendulum has swung too far.</TE>
<TE>   "I do hope some safeguards are put into the bill so those who
deserve to be compensated, can be compensated, and those who would
just use this as an opportunity to file fraudulent suits will be
discouraged," said one high-ranking Catholic official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Current state law allows victims of childhood sexual abuse to sue
until their 26th birthday or until three years after discovering that
their emotional problems were linked to a molestation. In the latter
case, only the perpetrator--not the institution--can be sued.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for some victims recently have tried to work around
statute-of-limitations barriers by filing fraud and conspiracy suits
against church leaders, alleging they protected known criminals and
gave victims the impression that their molestation was an insolated
case and had been properly handled.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespersons for the bill's co-authors, state Sens. Martha
Escutia (D-Whittier) and John Burton (D-San Francisco), said they
acted in response to months of recent revelations about the way some
Catholic bishops protected priests known to have a history of abusing
minors.</TE>
<TE>   "If this happens, once again California will be the leader in the
country protecting the rights of victims of sexual abuse," said Sue
Griffith, a Long Beach therapist whose son's lawsuit against a
Catholic priest was tossed out of court because of the statute of
limitations. "The timing is just perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Edward E. Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic
Conference, a Sacramento-based lobbying group for the state's
dioceses, said his organization has taken no position on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of political muscle in the state Capitol is new to
Catholic lobbyists, who waged a spirited but unsuccessful campaign in
1996 to keep priests from being added as "mandatory reporters" of
child sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The law makes it a misdemeanor for such people to fail to report
to law enforcement officers any suspicion that a child may have been
abused.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic officials said they were concerned only that the sanctity
of confession--a sacrament of the church--would be damaged, though
the legislation exempted those conversations.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for Catholic priests: General conversations often lead
to confessions, and it's difficult to separate the two for both
clerics and the confessor.</TE>
<TE>   "The 12 Catholic dioceses of California have developed procedures
to deal quickly and effectively with suspected or real child abuse,"
wrote Msgr. E. James Petersen, then executive director of the
California Catholic Conference, during discussions on the 1996 bill.
The bill will lead all involved "into a morass of uncharted area,
immense confusion and constitutional conflict."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, church pressure was great enough to get the
legislation killed, though victims' advocates rallied to convince
lawmakers to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "We started our telephone trees at 6 a.m. in the morning, and got
the message to the legislators," said Donald Hoard of Petaluma, whose
son was molested by a Northern California priest. "And boom, they
reversed themselves. That was pretty dramatic. It made us feel good
that we could command that kind of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   After three months, during which time church theologians reviewed
and approved the bill's wording, church officials decided to back the
legislation a few days before its final passage.</TE>

<HD>State Tech Czar Resigns Over Oracle Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Department of Information Technology Director Elias
Cortez, who helped push the state's ill-fated $95-million computer
software contract with Oracle Corp., resigned Monday, a month after
Gov. Gray Davis suspended him with pay from his $120,000-a-year post.</LD>
<LD>   Cortez is the fourth Davis administration official involved in the
Oracle deal or matters related to government use of computers who has
been forced to resign in recent weeks. Davis suspended Cortez last
month amid reports that employees of his department had shredded
documents.</LD>
<LD>   State Justice Department authorities are continuing to investigate
the shredding and other matters related to the Oracle deal, which was
awarded in May 2001 without competitive bids and has become the focus
of legislative and law enforcement scrutiny.</LD>
<TE>   Davis press secretary Steven Maviglio explained the delay in
Cortez's forced resignation by saying, "We wanted to hear his
testimony and now we've heard it .... This is part of the governor's
continuing effort to clean house."</TE>
<TE>   Several questions remain unanswered about the state's decision to
enter into the contract. However, Cortez took the lead in pushing the
deal and was among its biggest boosters, administration officials
have testified. Several officials said they relied on the Department
of Information Technology to provide technical analysis and offer
assurances that there would be demand for Oracle software.</TE>
<TE>   While the contract was touted as a way for the state to save more
than $100 million on software purchases, an audit in April concluded
that it could cost the state $41 million more than if there had been
no agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle executives contend that the contract will save the state
money. But Oracle and its partner, Northrop Grumman subsidiary
Logicon, continue negotiating with the state to rescind the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised it took so long," said Assemblyman Dean Florez
(D-Shafter), chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee,
adding that Cortez offered conflicting and contradictory testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez appeared three times before the legislative committee
investigating the Oracle contract, and is not expected to reappear.
In his final appearance two weeks ago, Cortez said he had been cut
out of the final decision on the software-licensing contract. He also
told lawmakers that he felt "abandoned" by the administration, and
had no source of income other than his state job.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez also charged that a rival in the administration made a
comment to a Silicon Valley executive whose firm had donated to
former Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan that the
donor viewed as threatening.</TE>
<TE>   That official, Arun Baheti, denied any such threat. Baheti
nonetheless resigned as Davis' director of e-government after it was
revealed that Baheti accepted a $25,000 donation on Davis' behalf
from an Oracle lobbyist, shortly after the state agreed to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   In a resignation letter that he closed with the words, "Your loyal
servant," Cortez defended himself and his department, saying, "I am
proud to have delivered on my commitment to no major failed I.T.
projects under our oversight."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to consideration being given to plans to dismantle the
Department of Information Technology, Cortez said: "I cannot find it
in me to be an active participant nor would I advise you or this
administration to dismantle such a pertinent program."</TE>

<LD>More than three years after three Yosemite National Park tourists
were killed, jury selection began Monday in the trial of former motel
handyman Cary Stayner, who confessed but pleaded innocent by reason
of insanity in hopes of avoiding execution.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty prospective jurors were brought into Santa Clara County
Superior Court. Judge Thomas Hastings dismissed 43 because of
hardships, and also excused his sister, who had ended up in the pool.
The remaining 36 were asked to fill out a questionnaire detailing
their knowledge of the case.</LD>

<LD>In a report on the densely populated college community of 20,000
residents, the county grand jury called Isla Vista a "community in
neglect" that sorely needs someone or some agency to take charge.</LD>
<LD>   The grand jury report said the county Board of Supervisors needs
to determine which of the more than 27 agencies with overlapping
jurisdiction over Isla Vista should take the lead. The panel made 18
recommendations aimed at crime, congestion, overcrowding, poor
lighting and blight.</LD>

<HD>Wildfires Spark Debate on Fireworks</HD>
<DH>Safety: Roadside sales boost community revenue, but dry
conditions prompt some areas to consider bans.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With rainfall far below normal and wildfires flaring across Southern
California, authorities in some areas are considering a ban on sale
of Fourth of July fireworks this year.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn called Monday for a meeting
with the county's fire chief to discuss possible emergency action to
suspend the sale of Fourth of July fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be a horrible thing to sell fireworks when we're burning
up as it is," said Flynn, referring to the 21,000-acre wildfire in
Los Padres National Forest.</LD>
<TE>   Fillmore is the only city in Ventura County that allows the sale
of "safe and sane" fireworks, which do not explode, dart across the
ground or lift into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Across California, 229 cities allow the sale of fireworks,
including 38 in Los Angeles County. Five of Orange County's 34 cities
allow such sales seasonally: Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove,
Santa Ana and Stanton. Officials said they would be loath to ban the
business because it is the main source of income for many community
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to ban the sale of fireworks, every Little League
team, soccer team and all the churches would be coming out of the
woodwork after us," Garden Grove Mayor Bruce Broadwater said. "This
makes a lot of money for them."</TE>
<TE>   Though fireworks must be set off in the city where they are
bought, fire and city officials said that legal fireworks sometimes
end up in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, they can't take the fireworks into the wild lands,
but it happens," said Gary Layman, an education specialist with the
Orange County Fire Authority. "Is there a danger? Heck yes."</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach is among cities that prohibit the sale of fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's too risky to even have the 'safe-and-sane' types,
but that's a local decision," said Jim Reed, the city's fire chief.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Brown, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Authority,
said, "We are especially concerned this year. It is no secret that
fire conditions are extremely dangerous right now. One errant
firework would be all it would take to cause an inferno. Our advice
is that the best way to enjoy a safe Fourth of July is to go to a
public display."</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, at least nine fires in recent years have been
ignited by illegal fireworks, Flynn said. The largest burned 4,300
acres in the Ojai Valley in 1999. Firefighting costs totaled more
than $5.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Brush fires have consumed more than 45,000 acres in Ventura and
Los Angeles counties this month alone, largely in unincorporated
areas. Other wildfires have scorched 11,000 acres in the region since
the beginning of May, with total firefighting costs estimated so far
at $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County had brush fires in February and April, followed in
May by a blaze that burned 1,100 acres near Rancho Santa Margarita,
creeping to within 10 feet of homes.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California blazes are among a wave of wildfires sweeping
the drought-stricken West, including areas in New Mexico, Utah and
Colorado, where nine fires have engulfed huge swaths of land.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens on Monday banned the sale of all
fireworks. Only public Fourth of July events run by professionals
will be permitted there this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gov. Gray Davis has not called for a similar ban, the
wildfires and dry conditions here have reignited debate over whether
fireworks sales are appropriate. Meteorologists say rain is unlikely
for at least five months.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Revell, spokesman for Fullerton-based American Promotional
Events Inc., a wholesaler of state-approved fireworks, said most
fires are caused by improper use of illegal fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an element of common sense that relates to
anything with a flame," he said. "That doesn't mean you make it
illegal."</TE>

<HD>Sports Academy Project on Hold</HD>
<DH>Hansen Dam: Power line concerns prompt search for new site
for baseball facility. Swimming lake is closed for repairs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a youth sports academy at Hansen Dam Recreation Area have
been scrapped, at least temporarily, and a popular swimming lake at
the site has been closed for repairs, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Major league baseball officials halted plans to build a
$10-million sports academy for youths from low-income families in the
northeast San Fernando Valley's 1,400-acre park after Southern
California Edison expressed concerns about the site because of
possible exposure to power lines.</LD>
<LD>   Edison wanted to put the baseball project on hold until the state
completes a survey on the health effects of electromagnetic fields
emitted from power lines and other sources, company spokesman Steve
Conroy said.</LD>
<TE>   About a month ago, baseball officials decided they had waited long
enough for the study to be released.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to not lose momentum, we had to start looking for an
alternate site," baseball Vice President Jimmie Lee Solomon said.</TE>
<TE>   He said baseball officials would like to keep the proposed youth
academy in the Valley, but he declined to identify other possible
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball officials are considering another location in the Hansen
recreation area as one of their options, said Bob Blumenfield,
district director for Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills).</TE>
<TE>   The academy was planned as a joint project between the city and
major league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents protested that the project would bring more traffic
and development to an area that is still considered horse country.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Snider of the Lake View Terrace Homeowners' Assn. said she
was "very happy" that baseball officials had withdrawn from the
original site.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the park's popular swimming lake was drained and dug up
because pipes underneath were leaking, according to Ed Louie of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the recreation area. Louie
said the $3-million repair project is expected to be completed by
July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Some area residents were upset by the corps' decision to dump the
broken chunks of concrete from the swimming lake into another body of
water on the north side of the recreation area that many use for
swimming.</TE>
<TE>   However, the impounded water is not a swimming hole, but a "borrow
pit"--an area meant to catch runoff from the surrounding
foothills--said Katie Parks, an Army Corps recreation planner.</TE>
<TE>   Corps officials said they were filling in the 60-foot-deep pit
because it was a health hazard. Among other things, they have
considered turning the area into a shallow wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Kramer of nearby Sunland swims in the pit regularly and
considers it a pleasant, more unstructured complement to the
recreation area's designated swimming spot. She said she can't
believe it's being used as a dumping ground, and is especially angry
that residents weren't consulted about the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "When did they ever ask anybody who uses that area what they want
to do with it?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Corps officials said Monday they would consult with neighbors
before they make any further decisions about the property.</TE>

<HD>Long Overdue, New Library Is in the Works</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: The city is seeking state funds to help build a
bigger south branch to better serve the needs of its immigrant
clientele.</DH>

<LD>Like clockwork, Oxnard librarian Tony Ramirez braces for the 5 p.m.
crush of visitors. As manager of the south Oxnard branch, he knows
students, workers and families will soon stream in and transform the
tiny building into a bustling community center.</LD>
<LD>   "By that time, there is not one person coming in; it's a flow of
people--like five, six, eight. The mother comes in with the stroller,
the kids run in, the father comes in with the baby at the end," he
said.</LD>
<LD>   It's part of the evolution of a library in an immigrant
neighborhood, Ramirez said, adding that his sanctuary of literature
has gone from a once-quiet place to a noisy station of acculturation.</LD>
<TE>   With barely 4,000 square feet, the branch at 200 E. Bard Road
fills up if more than one class from a nearby school visits or more
than a few families stop by at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   City officials are seeking $5.7 million in state library funds to
build a 23,000-square-foot facility in the 4300 block of Saviers Road
to better serve the community's needs--from more computers and study
areas to increased literacy programs and additional materials for
those learning English.</TE>
<TE>   The library's total price tag would be $8 million, and the city
has agreed to provide the remaining funds, said Barbara Murray,
Oxnard's library director. Construction could begin in 2004 and be
completed by 2006, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Competition with other cities for a portion of the state's
$350-million library bond will be stiff, Murray said, but
partnerships that the Oxnard library has set up with the Ocean View
and Hueneme school districts should give it priority.</TE>
<TE>   The current library branch, housed in a room belonging to the
city's recreation department, would be converted into a youth center
if the library funds come through, Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The library staff surveyed the community to determine what it
wants in a new library. Topping the list: computer labs with Internet
access, homework assistance, quiet study areas, materials to assist
with learning English and literacy programs.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said literacy in this part of Oxnard remains low, and state
test scores reveal children in need of help. Of 16 local schools
responding to a library survey on Academic Performance Index scores,
three ranked 1, most ranked 4 or lower and none ranked higher than 6,
with 1 representing the bottom 10% of schools and 10 the top 10%.</TE>
<TE>   A homework assistance center planned for the new library would
offer individualized help, and a computer lab would have 74
terminals, compared to nine now.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it here because it has my favorite books," said Earvin
Morales, 11, recently surfing the Internet at the library. "I like
history, aliens, wars, Martin Luther King. And magazines with
cartoons."</TE>
<TE>   "Literacy is always about availability--it increases as available
resources increase," said Samuel Carter, a teacher at E.L. Green
Junior High whose sixth-grade class visits the library once a month.</TE>
<TE>   The library houses about 48,000 items; the new library could hold
about 103,000.</TE>
<TE>   Because the staff learned that between 21% and 79% of neighborhood
students take classes in English as a second language, the new
library would offer programs designed to raise English skills.</TE>
<TE>   As things stand, up to 150 people are on a waiting list to check
out the library's English training videos. And the library's
Spanish-language collection is also popular, Ramirez said, including
health and parenting books and magazines frayed from being checked
out hundreds of times.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez said patrons are interested in even more books on health,
learning English, getting a job and obtaining citizenship.</TE>

<HD>OCTA Boosts Budget by 13%</HD>
<DH>Transit: Agency OKs spending $647 million on a mix of rail
and freeway projects, and better bus service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Monday approved a
$647.3-million budget for next year that earmarks more money for
highway improvements, the CenterLine rail project and new bus service
to bolster ridership.</LD>
<LD>   After months of preparation, the authority's board of directors
unanimously passed a spending package for fiscal 2002-03 that is $73
million, or 13%, more than the $574 million budgeted for the fiscal
year ending June 30.</LD>
<LD>   "Our priorities are in the right place," said Orange County
Supervisor Todd Spitzer, chairman of the OCTA board. "The budget is
not only balanced in terms of finances, it is balanced in its mix of
transit and highway projects."</LD>
<TE>   The spending priorities include more bus service, including routes
that will run 24 hours a day, and $38 million for preliminary
engineering on the revived CenterLine proposal, an 18-mile light-rail
system linking Irvine, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The commuter train was shelved last year because of a lack of
political support. But renewed interest by the three participating
cities helped restart the project. Opponents in Irvine, however, are
preparing a ballot initiative to kill the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Also high on the priority list are the long-awaited reconstruction
of the Garden Grove Freeway and the widening of the two miles of the
Santa Ana Freeway before it enters Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   During the upcoming year, the authority wants to spend $15 million
for design work on the Santa Ana Freeway and acquire the right of way
for the Garden Grove Freeway project, which will include widening the
roadway, sound walls and carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA's expenditures will be paid for with $613.6 million in
revenue and $33.7 million in reserves that have been set aside for
transportation projects. Officials said spending will increase in
fiscal 2002-03 compared with last year because of the purchase of
vehicles and several major projects that are moving forward,
requiring more staff and capital expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a larger-than-usual budget increase," OCTA spokesman George
Urch said. "We've got four big-ticket items starting up: CenterLine,
the 22 [Garden Grove Freeway], I-5 [the Santa Ana Freeway], and a new
bus base in Santa Ana."</TE>
<TE>   The authority is planning to add more than 76,000 hours of bus
service next year in an attempt to increase the number of passengers
boarding annually by at least 784,000. New 24-hour and 20-hour bus
service--"night owl" runs--will be added to OCTA's busiest routes,
such as the 60, the 43, the 50, and the 57.</TE>
<TE>   After correcting problems caused by fare increases and scheduling
changes, OCTA has one of the nation's highest growth rates in bus
ridership. It recently celebrated its billionth passenger.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, OCTA became concerned when bus ridership fell about
3 million boardings short of expectations for 2000-01. Officials say
OCTA has made up that loss. There are now about 60 million boardings
a year.</TE>
<TE>   To help handle the renewed growth, OCTA plans to push ahead with a
$38-million bus operations center in Santa Ana and add 20 articulated
buses--or double buses--to its fleet. The 60-foot vehicles cost more
than $500,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Monday, the OCTA board postponed for up to a year
a decision on whether to add more representatives from county cities
to the authority's board. OCTA has been under pressure by the
county's 34 cities to expand municipal representation on the
policy-making body.</TE>
<TE>   The cities seek to increase the number of directors from local
municipalities from six to 10--two from each of the five
supervisorial districts. The proposal would raise the number of
voting members on the board from 11 to 15 and eliminate the body's
three alternate directors.</TE>
<TE>   The issue resurfaced when Santa Ana Mayor Miguel A. Pulido
recommended a compromise that would add two cities and guarantee
board slots to the county's three largest cities--Anaheim, Garden
Grove and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   City officials and board members agreed that more time was needed
to thoroughly research whether the panel should be overhauled and, if
so, how it might be reconfigured.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of issues need to be ironed out," said board member and
Anaheim Councilwoman Shirley McCracken, who is skeptical of the
proposal. "How many large and small cities should be on the board? Do
we even need these changes? All these issues need to be placed on the
table."</TE>

<HD>Cooler Weather Helps Slow Wolf Fire</HD>
<DH>Battle: Firefighters expect to have the blaze contained by
Friday evening. So far, it has cost taxpayers more than $11.5
million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Across some of the most treacherous terrain so far, hand crews Monday
continued a final push against the Wolf fire, now expected to be
fully contained by Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   "They made some good progress today," said Craig Vanderswaag, a
firefighter with the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. "Things
are moving real well because the weather has been great for
firefighting."</LD>
<LD>   Cooler weather and increasing humidity continued to slow the
wildfire's northeasterly progress Monday as hundreds of firefighters
were released from duty and crews began disassembling large tents at
the Soule Park base camp in Ojai. Late Monday officials said the fire
was 60% contained.</LD>
<TE>   From a high of nearly 2,000 firefighters flown in to battle the
blaze from across the country, about 1,100 remained Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A team of firefighters from Stanislaus National Forest remained at
Mutau Flats northeast of the wildfire to protect six cabins that were
still threatened, Vanderswaag said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the change in weather headed off what could have
been a catastrophic blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have gone a long way. It could have gone to Interstate
5," said Dan Gosnell, a battalion chief for the San Bernardino
National Forest, who has spent the past week planning strategies to
fight the wildfire. "But we have had some good weather."</TE>
<TE>   However, the fire is still dangerous for those on the front lines,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 firefighters specially trained in battling wildfires are
stationed on either side of the head of the fire near the north slope
of Pine Mountain Ridge. Using pickaxes and shovels, both crews of
about 200 are cutting through thick tangles of trees and brush to
carve a containment line.</TE>
<TE>   The teams are expected to complete the line in the next few days,
with full containment Friday, Gosnell said.</TE>
<TE>   The work is being done near steep rock outcroppings, where a slip
could mean serious injury, Gosnell said. The crews rappelled into the
area Sunday by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hot and it's dusty and dirty, and there is a lot of work to
be done," Gosnell said. Firefighters "take a break to nap and they
are back to work. There are snakes, ants, bee stings, dehydration,
poison oak .... It's a young person's game."</TE>
<TE>   The fire has transformed nearly 21,300 acres of dry pine trees and
thick chaparral along steep ridges and low valleys into a gray,
treeless landscape visible from many points along the reopened
California 33.</TE>
<TE>   The fire is expected to burn a total of about 22,500 acres before
it's contained, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the use of heavy machinery is prohibited in the federally
protected Sespe Wilderness, bulldozers were allowed in last week to
clear five miles of trails to help slow the fire's progress toward a
condor sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Monday that since the fire started June 1, it has
cost federal, state and county agencies more than $11.5 million.
Several roads and recreation areas, including the entire Sespe
Wilderness, remain closed.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cause of the wildfire has not been determined,
sources familiar with the investigation have said that sparks from
firearms shot at a van parked in tall grass behind a restaurant north
of Ojai on California 33 most likely ignited the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of a bicycle touring group said they witnessed
people shooting at the van, and then watched the steep hill behind it
go up in flames shortly afterward.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the restaurant remained closed and yellow police tape
surrounded the van.</TE>
<TE>   In northern Los Angeles County, a wildfire that destroyed nine
homes and charred more than 23,400 acres over several days was
contained late Monday, fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The six-day cost of fighting the Copper fire in Los Angeles County
was estimated at more than $6.4 million and could reach $9.4 million,
according to U.S. Forest Service and Los Angeles County fire
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe a spark from welding equipment at a
construction site on Copper Hill Road in San Francisquito Canyon
touched off the flames Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of like fighting a flow of gasoline," said Los
Angeles County Fire Capt. Brian Jordan. "Our engines can only hold
500 gallons of water, and it was very difficult to make progress in
terrain that was 90% inaccessible. The key elements for us in
situations like that are the bulldozers and helicopters."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Andrew Blankstein contributed to this report.</TE>
