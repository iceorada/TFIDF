<LD>It was just after Sept. 11 when L.A. composer Hans Zimmer sat down to
score Ridley Scott's new film, "Black Hawk Down," an unrelenting
account of the 15-hour battle between besieged U.S. troops and Somali
fighters on the streets of Mogadishu in 1993. But the Oscar-winning
composer tried to clear his mind of that horrible day as he wrote.
"One of the things that was important was not to let Sept. 11
influence the way I was working," he said. "I was trying to stay true
to a certain moment in time."</LD>
<LD>   Long before the terrorist attacks, Zimmer had met with director
Scott and editor Pietro Scalia to conceptualize the score for the
film. They agreed the music should communicate that "America doesn't
realize how small the world is," Zimmer said.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, Zimmer's score incorporated the haunting vocals of
Senegalese performer Baaba Maal, accompanied by what he calls "ethnic
instruments" to illustrate the Somali struggle and heavy rock guitar
and techno music to represent the high-tech American Rangers.</LD>
<TE>   Zimmer, whose first claim to fame was as a member of the Buggles,
which recorded the 1979 hit song "Video Killed the Radio Star," said
he met with members of the elite Army Rangers and read up on the
battle while scoring the film. "I had to have an element of respect
for everybody in this music," he said. "I very quickly realized that
part of having respect is to be fairly out there and write dangerous
music ... music that might provoke, that might put you in this tough
spot emotionally in some way."</TE>
<TE>   Zimmer and his team of musicians, who had just completed
"Hannibal" and "Pearl Harbor," worked on a tight deadline after
Revolution Studios moved up the film's release date by three months.
"All I know is that I was trying not to write film music," Zimmer
said. "And the greatest compliment I got was from a Ranger. He said,
'Yeah, that sounds like the way it felt.'"</TE>

<TE>   In Rampart's Shadow</TE>
<TE>   Signs directing TV production crews to a sound stage near the LAPD
Rampart Division's West Temple Street station popped up this week.
Turns out they were for the people working on "The Shield," the FX
network's new show about corrupt cops that was renamed in August from
its original "Rampart" after the Los Angeles Police Department
complained about the title.</TE>
<TE>   The show's creator and executive producer, Shawn Ryan, said he
didn't choose the area because of its proximity to the real Rampart
station. The show's sound stage, at Sunset Boulevard and Hillhurst
Avenue, is in the vicinity. As for exteriors, Ryan said he wanted to
shoot in areas of Los Angeles that are unfamiliar to TV audiences,
places where "all the store signs are in Spanish and the houses are a
little more rundown. ..."</TE>
<TE>   The show is set in the fictitious locale of the Farmington
District, Ryan said, and is "only partially, loosely inspired by the
Rampart scandal."</TE>
<TE>   An FX spokesman has said the show's name was changed because
people outside of Los Angeles are unfamiliar with the Rampart
scandal. But, according to someone familiar with discussions between
the network and police, after LAPD officials saw the pilot, they
asked that all references to the department--including badges and
police cars--be excised.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time that Rampart has been immortalized on
television. The police station's exterior was used in the opening
shot of the 1970s pro-police TV show "Adam-12."</TE>

Russell Crowe speaking to Diane Sawyer after she asked him about his

<LD>Poor Jack Tagger, onetime investigative reporter, has been demoted to
obituary writer after spouting off to a superior. And, as if this
weren't punishment enough, Tagger is also plagued by fears of
prematurely dying, his daily focus on the already dead seeming to
exacerbate his phobia.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Hiaasen's new novel, "Basket Case," will give readers plenty
of chuckles over the inexhaustible drives that often send us in
exactly the opposite direction of where we are meaning to go.
Forty-six, lonely and hilariously neurotic, Tagger hasn't figured out
how to sustain a meaningful relationship, let alone rise to the fore
of his field. But Hiaasen doesn't leave us stranded, as he endows his
protagonist with the capacity, and the good fortune, to finally grow
up.</LD>
<LD>   While working on an obituary for 39-year-old ex-rock 'n' roll star
Jimmy Stoma of the Slut Puppies, Tagger discovers troubling
indications that foul play may have caused the man to drown during a
diving expedition. His meeting with the ex-star's ambitious,
self-involved wife, Cleo Rio, only heightens Tagger's suspicions.
Could budding rock diva Cleo, not present for the dive, have caused
her husband's untimely death? This is the question Tagger sets out to
answer, and his efforts take us on a rollickingly comic and
suspenseful adventure.</LD>
<TE>   Seen through Tagger's eyes, Cleo appears to be the perfect
contemporary vamp: "She is maybe twenty-two years old; twenty three,
tops. Medium tall, thin but not skinny, and alarmingly tan. The hair
is bleached snow white and cut in a mock pageboy. The lips are done
cherry red and the cheekbones are heavily shadowed, like a pair of
matching bruises. She's wearing a beige sleeveless top and tight
white slacks. Her toenails, also white, remind me of paint chips."</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen balances the novel with his portrait of the ironic,
self-contained Emma, Tagger's 27-year-old editor, with whom he
maintains, at least for a time, an antagonistically competitive
rapport. From Tagger's perspective, Emma possesses little in the way
of newspaper moxie, and he plans to gradually convince her to leave
the business. But Tagger's precipitous assessment of Emma has more to
do with his sense of shame over his demotion than it does with her
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Hiaasen's depiction of the greed and dishonesty among the
newspaper moguls themselves livens the story, suggesting that bold
reporters tend to be at the mercy of their higher-ups, since, in
these troubled times, readers, or so the moguls say, want to be
soothed rather than alarmed by dismaying news.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Tagger sets himself against the establishment when he
prods Emma to allow him a week to investigate Stoma's death, an
unusual amount of time to prepare for a back-page obituary.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Stoma is to be cremated, Tagger manages to view the
body, and much to his shock (and to his great investigative delight),
he can find no stitches on it, indicating that an autopsy hadn't even
been performed.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to Stoma's sister, Janet, a likable online porn performer,
Tagger continues to probe on a possible murder motivation. Meanwhile,
stranger things are happening, as one by one, former members of the
Slut Puppies are being killed off. Pulling Emma along with him,
Tagger steps up his investigation, and their new camaraderie turns
even more comic and charming. With the help of Janet and some of his
own technical wizard friends, Tagger finds that Cleo is readying
herself to come out with a new song which she hopes will top the
charts. Tagger manages to research the song's origins to find that,
yes, Stoma himself had written the piece long ago and had been
planning to release it.</TE>
<TE>   But Tagger has his own ambitions in tow, as he is hoping to
unearth a very big story on Stoma, one that will restore him to days
of passed glory. The suspense in "Basket Case" comes not from
figuring out whodunit but how Tagger manipulates his higher-ups at
the paper in order to get a front-page byline. Hiaasen's witty
explorations of muckraking journalism and the unabashedly
self-interested moguls who run the papers will keep readers laughing
straight through to the novel's conclusion.</TE>

<HD>Eau! A New Reason to Clean</HD>
<DH>Upscale cleaning products seek to please all the senses--
for a pretty penny, of course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to who's the slob in the relationship, my husband and I
go against gender stereotypes. He's the neat freak, I'm the incurable
mess-maker for whom putting shoes in the closet is a monumental
event. "I'm always picking up after you" is his weekly admonition,
about which I cannot argue, although I do remind him of other
virtues, such as an ability to yell out many correct "Jeopardy"
answers.</LD>
<LD>   Needless to say, he does most of the household cleaning. OK,
practically all of it. On the rare occasion when he sticks a sponge
in my hand and tells me to get to work, I am particular about the
products I use--nothing that makes my eyes tear and my throat close.
So it was with great hope that I approached some new, prettily
packaged cleaning and home products from Caldrea, Mrs. Meyer's,
Williams-Sonoma and the Good Home Co., everything from laundry powder
and dish soap to countertop cleaner, laundry spray and furniture
cream.</LD>
<TE>   Each of the brands is designed to smell good, incorporating
essential oils and other natural ingredients in biodegradable
solutions. Sure, you can buy Palmolive in nice flowery and herbal
scents now, and natural food stores have been carrying
enviro-friendly cleaning products for years. But don't look on most
grocery store shelves for this new generation of cleaners. These are
targeted at high-end shoppers--the kind who indulge in aromatherapy
products. Indeed, some of these cleaners smell good enough to be
mistaken for bath and body products.</TE>
<TE>   So far, two companies seem to dominate this niche market, one of
them with three lines. Caldrea, based in Minneapolis and a year and a
half old, produces the Mrs. Meyer's and Williams-Sonoma lines. The
New York City-based Good Home Co. is 6 years old and also offers a
line of moisturizers, bath oil and body scrubs.</TE>
<TE>   All of these products come in packaging suited for farmhouses,
Victorian parlors and World War II-era kitchens. Fragrances range
from familiar to exotic: lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena,
honeysuckle vine, beach house, citrus mint ylang ylang and white
clover. They're available at places like Fred Segal, Nordstrom and
Bristol Farms. And, yes, you will pay dearly for them: About $8 for
16 ounces of dish soap, $18.50 for 34 ounces of laundry fragrance,
$10 for 16 ounces of all-purpose cleaner and $25 for 48 ounces of
laundry powder.</TE>
<TE>   Pricey, yes, but remember that consumers have been bingeing on
fragrant candles for $20, room spray for $15 and  potpourri for $30
for years without blinking an eye--all in an effort just to make
their homes smell good.</TE>
<TE>   This love affair with things that smell good is what's been
fueling this new crop of cleaning products, says Brian Sansoni, a
spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Soap and Detergent Assn.:
"We've been noticing the array of fragrances and pleasing scents in
cleaning products in the last year and half," he said. "Fragrance
definitely makes a difference to the consumer, as does packaging.
Obviously, for brand loyalty the product has to work, but fragrance
and packaging are a big draw."</TE>
<TE>   Monica Nassif, who founded Caldrea, says there is indeed a market
for her products. "I'd come home and think, 'Why does the kitchen
smell like Murphy Oil and the bathroom like Lysol?' I'd be lighting
Aveda candles to mask the smells."</TE>
<TE>   Using her extensive background in marketing--she's worked for
Target, Disney and 3M--Nassif did some research and found little in
the way of upper-end, nasally pleasing cleaning products that also
look good enough to be left out on the counter. She aimed the Mrs.
Meyer's line at a younger, aspirational customer, and the Caldrea
line to a slightly older, more affluent consumer, someone who might
buy these products for the housekeeper to use.</TE>
<TE>   While she wouldn't reveal the full ingredient list, Nassif did say
the laundry powder contains an oxygen bleach plus a natural
de-stainer and degreaser, with no dyes or fillers; the window cleaner
has no ammonia but a plant-derived alcohol base; and the dish soap
contains cleaning surfactants and a natural degreaser.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Dimmick started the Good Home Co. in 1995 in her kitchen
with the idea of "enhancing someone's home style and doing that
mainly through scent." Like Nassif, she didn't like the fragrances
she was finding in mass-produced products: "They're fake, and they
don't remind you of any particular smell." Although she works with a
manufacturer now, the goal is the same: "When I create my products,
I'm really trying to bring up a memory, like honeysuckle vine. That
reminds me of my grandmother's backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Good Home Co. line comes packaged in glass containers
instead of plastic because they're reusable and can become "part of
the design of the home," according to Dimmick. Products include cedar
closet spray, tub and tile cream cleanser, all-purpose spray and
sheet spray, in fragrances such as lavender, dandelion and lemon
chamomile.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma reports good sales of its new line, introduced
late last year. In a post-holiday push, the new products are featured
on the cover of its current catalog and displayed prominently in
stores. But because these products represent such a small share of
the market, there hasn't been any sales tracking yet although Sansoni
of the Soap and Detergent Assn. expects the niche to grow. Evidently
we spent a lot of money on this stuff--in 2000-2001, sales reached
$2.3 billion, although overall sales were down 6.1% from the previous
year, according to Information Resources Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced the trend will survive past infancy. Tom
Branna, editor of the trade publication Household and Personal
Products Industry, said, "The consumer will buy it once because she's
surprised by it, but as for repeat purchases, I doubt it. The novelty
wears off pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, no one thought organic foods would grow into the huge
markets they are today, so only time will tell if expensive cleaning
products will ever gain wider acceptance. Still, these companies have
some convincing to do. At Williams-Sonoma recently, a woman walking
by the display was overheard saying to her friend, "Nine dollars for
window spray? I don't think I need my windows smelling like basil,
thank you."</TE>

<LD>As Brian Sansoni of the Soap and Detergent Assn. said, the success of
these pleasant-smelling, nicely packaged upper-end products, like any
cleaning products, must lie in their performance. With that in mind,
my husband and I went to work, road-testing several of the offerings.
Prices are approximate, and remember that reactions to fragrances are
subjective. Here's what we found:</LD>
<LD>   * Caldrea Laundry Powder in white clover ($25 for 48 ounces). I
tried this out on my gym clothes, which, after a workout, smell so
bad that the government should consider using them for chemical
warfare. Caldrea cleaned well and left my clothes with a light,
powdery fragrance, but for the price, I don't love it enough to
switch from Tide Free.</LD>
<LD>   * Good Home Co. Laundry Fragrance in lavender ($18.50 for 34
ounces). I also tested this one on my gym clothes and found a very
strong lavender fragrance when I removed them from the washer, even
though I used only the recommended one-third cup. The smell faded to
a pleasant hint of lavender after the clothes went through the dryer.
Even though each wash load takes only a small amount, this product is
definitely a splurge.</LD>
<TE>   * Caldrea Linen Spray in white clover ($10 for 16 ounces). My
husband tried this on a silk neck scarf he wore while smoking a
cigar, and it killed the smoke smell and left a nice fragrance that
wasn't too flowery. I sprayed it on my clothes while ironing and
liked the smell, but it was strong enough that I kept getting whiffs
of it all day. Would definitely clash with any perfume.</TE>
<TE>   * Mrs. Meyer's Dish Soap in lavender ($6 for 16 ounces). High
marks for this product. The scent was pleasing, and it quickly
cleaned off caked-on food and grease. A little goes a long way.</TE>
<TE>   * Mrs. Meyer's Window Spray in lavender ($6 for 20 ounces): It
cleaned well and didn't streak, unlike some grocery store brands.
Nice fragrance. Ditto for Caldrea Window Spray ($8 for 16 ounces).</TE>
<TE>   * Caldrea All-Purpose Cleaner in green tea patchouli ($12 for 33.8
ounces). When diluted as directed, it worked wonders, cleaning
everything from a laminated wood tabletop and kitchen tiles to a
trash can and the bathroom. Little scrubbing required. I'm not a big
fan of patchouli, but blended with the green tea, the overall
impression was fresh and herbal.</TE>
<TE>   * Caldrea and Mrs. Meyer's Furniture Cream ($10 for 8 ounces for
Caldrea in green tea patchouli; $9.60 for 8 ounces for Mrs. Meyer's
in lavender): Both are good for a quick-fix, although we found we
used a lot since much was absorbed into the cloth. Both fragrances
were nice and mild.</TE>
<TE>   * Good Home Co. Dish and Hand Soap in pure grass ($10 for 17
ounces). Neither of us was crazy about the smell, and the soap suds
were difficult to rinse off the dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Final answer: Now that our house smells like an exclusive spa
resort, I'm not sure I can go back to Windex and Lysol. And, yes, I'm
thinking I may do more cleaning. Just don't tell my husband.</TE>

<LD>Camellias</LD>
<LD>   Winter weather might seem cold to you, but it's just right for
some of the most interesting plants, like camellias. Have you seen
their beautiful flowers? The climate of Southern California is
perfect for them.</LD>
<LD>   Camellias have glossy green leaves all year and burst into blooms
of many colors in winter. There are so many camellia varieties you
might think you're seeing different kinds of flowers. Some blossoms
have a single layer of petals and might remind you of a poppy. Others
are big and fluffy with many petals and look more like a rose. Like
people, some camellias enjoy crowds and grow in clusters. Others
demand their own space on the bush. They might be white, dark red or
any shade in between. A few are yellow. The names of some, like
Camellia sasanqua 'Fukuzutsumi,' seem difficult to pronounce. Others
are as easy to say as 'Valentine Day.'</LD>
<TE>   One relative of the camellia is so rare that Descanso Gardens is
the only place for thousands of miles where it grows. To see it
somewhere else, you would have to travel all the way to China or to
Florida's Disney World, its only other public home in this country.
It is Polyspora kwangsiensis. (You can pronounce it. Say
"polly-SPOR-a, kwang-see-EN-sis.")</TE>
<TE>   There are 40,000 camellia bushes blooming this time of year at
Descanso Gardens as well as hundreds of other plants. For more
information, call (818) 952-4401 or visit www.descansogar dens.org.</TE>

<HD>Reaching Out, With Cheek, to Young Jewish Readers</HD>
<DH>The provocatively titled magazine Heeb hopes to strike a
hip chord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALINA TUGEND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK --"This is the result," says Jennifer Bleyer, waving at
proofs of the soon-to-be released first issue of Heeb magazine, "of a
bunch of kids meeting for a year in an East Village basement and
cracking jokes about rabbis and Hebrew school."</LD>
<LD>   The glossy, 64-page publication she's holding includes a story
about Jewish stereotypes in the television show "The Simpsons," a
profile of Neil Diamond (complete with pullout poster), and a look at
Jews' relationship to pizza (ambivalent, according to the article).</LD>
<LD>   The "New Jew Review," as it bills itself, also has more serious
stories on political activism in Puerto Rico, Israel and the U.S. But
the main tone of the magazine is slick, edgy and knowing and, oh
yeah, Jewish.</LD>
<TE>   According to its promo postcard, the magazine is "an ambitious
antitrust investigation into the monopoly on God. It is a sweaty
prizefight between hip-hop and sushi in this corner and klezmer and
kugel in the other. It is the ... love child of Emma Goldman and
Lenny Bruce."</TE>
<TE>   It is also an effort to connect with young Jews who feel
disenfranchised from their religion. "I meet Jews all the time who
have such ambivalence about being Jews," says Heeb's ad manager,
David Kelsey, 31, whose day job is in the wholesale knish field. "For
most people, their education ends at a bar or bat mitzvah, so they
associate Judaism with that awkward adolescent age. Heeb is not just
about being hip. We hope it gets people to reexamine their own
Judaism."</TE>
<TE>   Bleyer, the magazine's 26-year-old editor, describes herself as
having a typical "suburban American Jewish schlock" upbringing in the
Midwest. Her first foray into journalism was in her teens with the
one-time publication of an underground punk magazine.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, she says, Judaism "seemed the absolute anathema of
everything I was interested in--punk rock, anarchy, literature.
Judaism seemed nerdy and boring. But I never felt embarrassed about
it. If anything, I wanted to connect."</TE>
<TE>   She first made that connection as an undergraduate at Columbia
University, when she combined her interests in punk rock and Judaism
with the publication of another one-issue low-tech magazine, Mazeltov
Cocktail.</TE>
<TE>   Bleyer went on to dream up Heeb while an intern at Harper's
magazine in spring 2000, and discovered she could get a $60,000 grant
from Joshua Venture, a San Francisco-based foundation aimed at
promoting young Jewish entrepreneurs. The foundation is backed by a
number of organizations, including Steven Spielberg's Righteous
Persons Foundation and the Andrea and Charles Bronfman
Philanthropies.</TE>
<TE>   Heeb, which plans to be a nonprofit quarterly, is due on
newsstands around the country Feb. 5. The initial circulation run
will be 16,000, and the first issue will cost $4.50. Distribution
will be in major bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders.</TE>
<TE>   Although the magazine has yet to be published, the name
Heeb--which is a deliberate misspelling of the ethnic slur
"Hebe"--has raised some eyebrows in the Jewish community for some
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the magazine's intent is to try and attract
disaffected Jews, which sounds like a fine purpose," says Ken
Jacobson, associate national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
"But why have a name that really distracts from its purpose? Words
like that still have power, and this tends to diminish the
sensitivity to them."</TE>
<TE>   Bleyer, who exudes a low-key confidence and a self-deprecating
sense of humor, obviously doesn't mind if her magazine provokes the
mainstream Jewish community. But she seems pleasantly surprised
that--so far--the response has been as positive as it has.</TE>
<TE>   Bleyer says that she received "hundreds and hundreds" of e-mails
last year following publicity about Heeb in the Jewish press and in
the weekly New York Observer, and very few were negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the name and the tone of the magazine, which is not nearly
as sanctimonious as the Jewish community likes to be, I'm surprised
how supportive [the Jewish community has] been. For every 50 e-mails
of support we get, there's one that accuses us of being self-hating
Jews."</TE>
<TE>   J.J. Goldberg, editor of the Forward, one of the oldest Jewish
newspapers in the country, says, "I don't have a problem with a
magazine with that name. I think it's bold, and I think it's on to
something. We have to think outside the box to reach the next
generation." The Forward, which is published in Manhattan, placed an
ad in Heeb's first issue.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg says, however, that "no one has shown how you build a
constituency if you burn your bridges, if you cut the ties to the
traditionalists and reach out to the next generation."</TE>
<TE>   The Heeb staff, pulled from Bleyer's pals from Columbia University
and other like-minded folk, is tiny. The advertising, which includes
the San Francisco beer company He'Brew, the Knitting Factory
nightclub and independent production company Freed Pictures, is
minimal and largely on an issue-by-issue basis. But interest among
prospective contributors is intense, judging from a recent meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In a dank basement of an East Village synagogue, about 40 people
gathered. They had been chosen by Bleyer and her colleagues from
about 100 people who had e-mailed to express an interest in
working--for free--for Heeb. These included writers, editors,
designers and business people. The intent of the meeting, Bleyer
says, was to pick out a few of the most qualified to help put out the
second issue of Heeb.</TE>
<TE>   Munching on bialys, they explained their background and interests.
There was purple hair and yarmulkes, serious writers and confused
seekers. Some were converted, others the product of mixed marriages,
a few the children of rabbis. But what tied them all together was
their age--virtually all were in their 20s and 30s. And they shared
an almost--dare one say?--religious-like fervor in explaining their
interest in Heeb.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Wachtel spoke about how she wanted to be involved because, as
a former deejay known as the "Night Nurse," she has seen many
similarities between Rasta and Jewish cultures. Elisheva Lambert
called herself a "totally neurotic Jew from Toronto who is doing
everything my parents didn't want me to. When I first heard of Heeb I
thought it was a really awful idea," she said. "Then I thought it was
the best idea I'd heard of."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hirschhorn, who is helping the staff develop a nonprofit
marketing plan, says, "There is a whole core of untapped young Jews
who feel very little connection to the organized Jewish world. The
offbeat irreverence of Heeb gives them a place to be unabashedly
Jewish."</TE>
<TE>   Heeb is far from the first publication to attempt to target young,
non-Orthodox Jews, but Bleyer and her cohorts argue that there has
been nothing like their magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Eshman, 41, editor of the Jewish Journal of Los Angeles, an
independent community newspaper, wishes Heeb luck but is skeptical
the new magazine can make it. "L.A. is littered with hip Jewish
publications that come and go," he says. "It's a tough, tough market.
You have to have deep pockets and a real passion. People always make
the argument--and these are the publications that make it to the
light of day--that what is needed is some magazine that will break
through the apathy and ignite Jewish fervor," he adds. "Everyone's
looking for that key."</TE>
<TE>   Eshman also argues that many newspapers like his have an
increasingly younger readership and staff--his editors and writers
are primarily in their 20s and early 30s--and therefore cover stories
similar to those in the magazines and newspapers that target young,
hip Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, Bleyer contends. "I'm sure the Jewish newspaper editors
don't think there's a need for Heeb magazine, but we've had thousands
of people sign up for our mailing list, and hundreds upon hundreds
writing to us months before an issue even hits the newsstand wanting
to know when and where it's coming out, so there's obviously a desire
for it," she says. Jewish newspapers exclude "a huge swath of us ...
who identify with our Jewishness in unconventional ways."</TE>
<TE>   Heeb's Web site sums up the difference neatly, stating that the
magazine is interested "in the inadvertently Jewish ... the Jewish by
side-glance rather than head-on."</TE>
<TE>   "It's very easy to point out what is Jewish about pastrami,
klezmer, dating frustrations and neurotic families," notes the Web's
letter to prospective contributors. "It is far more difficult to
point out what is Jewish about spirulina, Dolly Parton, the civil war
in Angola and serial killers in the Midwest. The latter is what we're
looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if there's enough cool, young Jewish stuff to write
about, but Bleyer says that because Heeb is a quarterly, she's not
worried. "If we came out once a week, it would get played out pretty
fast. We're coming out three or four times a year."</TE>
<TE>   The staff has enough money to publish two or three more issues,
Bleyer says, but then they will need an infusion of capital.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, though, Bleyer says she's not nervous about the
reaction to her magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will like it, some will hate it," she says. "And some
won't get it."</TE>

<HD>A Style From Yesteryear  Is Again in the Forefront</HD>
<DH>Combining past and future, a Korean firm markets a
front-loading washing machine that doubles as a dryer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As so often happens in design, what's old is new again. In the 1940s,
relatively expensive front-loading washing machines were introduced,
combining fully automatic washing and spinning in a single drum, a
big step away from hand-washing in washtubs or even the first
motor-driven washtub with a hand wringer, which was invented about
1900. As the years passed, however, front-loading machines gave way
to top-loading ones, which by the 1960s became the industry standard.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the front-loading washer is again the latest in design,
both for looks and efficiency. Some manufacturers, notably
Korea-based LG Electronics, are taking clothes cleaning into the
future by creating a machine that both washes and dries clothes in
the same model. Introduced last November, the LG Wash &amp; Dry Combo
with SenseClean has a direct drive system that provides a brush-less,
belt-less operation that LG claims has a greater rate of reliability
than conventional washing machines. All of that's certainly a long
way from what Catharine Beecher (1800-1878, sister of Harriet Beecher
Stowe) meant when she called laundry "the American housekeeper's
hardest problem."</LD>
<TE>   According to LG, most washing machines use a system in which the
motor is connected to the drum via a belt and pulley, resulting in a
loss of energy, lots of noise and vibrations. The washer/dryer,
however, delivers power to the drum through a motor attached directly
to its center, thereby reducing vibration levels by as much as 60%.
The machine adjusts motor power according to the amount and type of
laundry, so fabric damage and tangling are lessened. Clothes are
rotated during cleaning, not agitated. Then they are rinsed and dried
in one operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of combination units are stacked on top of each other," says
Daniel Lee, marketing and communications director of LG Electronics.
"But we made things even simpler by having one unit." Of course, the
downside is that you cannot start a new load of wash while drying
another.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important aspects of the machine, besides the
obvious space-saving one, is the potential for energy-saving. LG
estimates that this drum design lowers electricity usage by 38% and
reduces water consumption by 17% when compared with other washers.
This is just in time for the new U.S. Department of Energy guidelines
that require appliances to be more energy efficient by 2004. And
usually the clothes dryer is the second-biggest electricity-using
appliance, after the refrigerator in the home, costing about $85 to
operate annually, or $1,100 over its lifetime, according to
Department of Energy statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In energy efficiency, new front-load machines by a variety of
manufacturers are leading the way. According to the American Council
for an Energy-Efficient Economy, the re-emergence of front-loading
washers is an exciting development because they use much less water
to clean clothes and still clean them better than conventional,
top-loading models. LG's Wash &amp; Dry Combo has been given the EPA's
EnergyStar, a label the government puts on energy-efficient products
(www.en ergystar.gov).</TE>
<TE>   What's surprising about the  washer/dryer is that it can wash more
than 15 pounds of laundry, including items like curtains and bed
linens, even though the machine is 24 inches deep, the same as
traditional washing machines. Of particular interest to people who
live in small houses or apartments, the LG condensing drying system
uses cold water instead of forced air ventilation. Cold water flows
through a condenser beside the tub, and, according to the product
information, "hot humidity from the tub condenses into the cold water
and then flows out of the drain." As a result, the model doesn't have
to be next to an outside wall with an air vent.</TE>
<TE>   Other space age features include a digital readout that lets the
user program the finish time or learn how much time is left of
operation. A child-lock system prevents kids from pressing buttons
and changing the program during operation, and a drain filter
collects objects like loose change and can be easily removed and
cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   This week at the International Housewares Show in Chicago, LG also
introduced a washing machine and a refrigerator that can be turned on
via Internet from a home computer and that they've been "tweaking,"
according to Lee.  "That's the direction the kitchen and the home are
going in the future," says Lee. "Eventually the whole home will be
connected to the Internet. We want to be in the forefront of that."</TE>
<TE>   The suggested retail price for the Wash &amp; Dry Combo is $1,399,
which is about what it costs to buy two units. It's available at
independent retail stores or www.lgappliances .com. For vintage
washing machines: www.oldewash.com.</TE>
<TE>   Rem Koolhaas, the Dutch architect who recently won the commission
to redesign the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, will lecture at
UCLA's Dickson Auditorium at 5 p.m. on Jan. 27. Koolhaas was awarded
the Pritzker architecture prize in 2000 and has been on the faculty
of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are free, but seating is limited and will be provided on a
first-come, first-served basis. Parking is $6 and is available in Lot

<HD>The Key on the Collar</HD>
<DH>Part 4: The story so far: The lost dog with a mysterious
key on his collar has made another friend, but he must go on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH VAN STEENWYK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dog walked all night. Toward daylight he came to the edge of a
village. He was hungry and tired, but something made him go on.</LD>
<LD>   He came to the town square. Stores were still closed. No one
strolled through the park.</LD>
<LD>   The dog sniffed the air. He followed the strong smell. He stopped
at a trash can and sniffed again. Smoke curled out of the can. He'd
smelled smoke. The dog began to bark to alert people to the danger.</LD>
<TE>   A door opened across the street. "What's your problem?" said a
young man. Then he saw the smoke. "Thanks for the warning," he said.
A couple of seconds later, he hurried over to put out the fire with a
bucket of water.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a good fire alarm," said the young man, bending down to
pet the dog. "We can use you at the fire station. Come on." They
crossed the street and went inside. Clink, clink, clink went the key
on the dog's collar.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, everybody, I've got a new fire alarm," the young man said.
"Let's give him some breakfast, he earned it."</TE>
<TE>   They placed a dish full of bacon and eggs and pancakes in front of
the small, black dog, and he ate every crumb. Then he curled up on an
old rug for a nap.</TE>
<TE>   His new friend bent down to pet him. "I keep hearing a clinking
sound when you move," he said. "Now I see what it is. It's a key."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of the other firemen came over to admire the dog. "What
do you think that key is for?" one of them said.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't look like a car key."</TE>
<TE>   "How about a kid's playhouse?"</TE>
<TE>   "Could it be for a safe deposit at the bank?" another fireman
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," the others said together.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the dog stood up. He sniffed the air. Now he smelled
something else. Something very familiar. He walked to the front door
that opened to the square. He wagged excitedly. He scratched the
door. He had to get outside as fast as he could. Come on, someone,
open the door!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>The Fellowship of the Wedding Rings Is Put to the Test</HD>
<DH>Differing opinions about film reveal a startling truth: His
wife's a member of the Tolkien cult.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During a marriage, you learn things. Over the years, you discover
whether your spouse is a morning person or a night person, whether
they like their sandwiches cut in rectangles or triangles and whether
they belong to a cult.</LD>
<LD>   After almost five years of marriage, a mortgage and two kids, I
now know my wife is a morning person, likes sandwich rectangles and
is a J.R.R. Tolkien cult member. But before last week, her cult
status was completely unknown to me.</LD>
<LD>   Her secret was revealed the day we saw the "The Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Ring." Because our kids are under 3 and our
closest set of grandparents is 400 miles away, we sometimes see the
same movie on the same day, but in different shifts. That way, we can
talk about the film later and the Department of Social Services won't
take our children away, which is a good thing since we're pretty
attached to them.</LD>
<TE>   My wife returned from the morning performance and declared she
"loved" it. She was aglow and began chanting something about "All
that is gold does not glitter." The display didn't concern me, and I
wrote it off as normal behavior after being child-free for several
consecutive hours.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with our "same-day movie" pact, she restrained herself
from further discussion until I had seen the flick. When I came home
later that evening, my wife's fair face shone with that same look of
hopeful expectancy I see every birthday, Christmas, anniversary and
half a dozen other high-pressure, gift-giving occasions. That same
look that says, "Please, Lord of the Rings, don't let this be from
the National Football League merchandise store." And like every other
time, her hopes get chucked into the fiery volcanic pits of Mount
Doom.</TE>
<TE>   I had no idea I was discussing a sacred text when I began my movie
review. The film had all the elements I love in a motion picture, I
started. Lots of horsies, loads of foreboding weather and a
respectable body count (at least 10,000 Orcs were harmed in the
making of the film).</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, I noticed something was amiss. Normally, after a
crack like that, she'd laugh. (I think that's why I married her, she
does laugh so at my quips and gibes--no, those are not Hobbit names.)
Instead, she was ominously quiet.</TE>
<TE>   "Middle-earth to wife, Middle-earth to wife?"</TE>
<TE>   More silence. And a glare. The kind of glare I hadn't seen since
Christmas morning. These must be misfires, I thought; better reload.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of wizard gets trapped on top of a tower, like a kitty
stuck in a tree? And didn't this Gandalf guy realize the second he
saw Christopher Lee that he was a bad guy? He'd better put down the
Hobbit pipe."</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't make fun," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, I make a joke about her parents, she says tell me
another. I make a joke about my parents, she says tell me 10 more.
Now, all of a sudden, a yuk ban?</TE>
<TE>   But, like Frodo in the face of unimaginable peril, I pressed on.
(Maybe this is why she married me, my Frodo-like courage.) I had one
more point to make, and, by gum, I was going to make it, no matter
what dangers lay ahead.</TE>
<TE>   WARNING: Do not read past this point unless you want to know the
film's ending. Or is that the right word? Because there wasn't an
ending. It just drops off a cliff. If the title of the film were like
the ending, it would have read "Lord of the Ri."</TE>
<TE>   "The film ends where 'The Fellowship of the Ring' ends," said my
wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, it's part of a trilogy ..."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a trilogy," she snapped. "That was a publishing trick."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tale told in three parts--a trilogy. And other trilogies
have conclusions at the end of each segment. Think 'Star Wars' before
that ridiculous fourth installment. Think 'Godfather' in spite of
that ridiculous third installment. And think 'Porky's!'" (From first
to last, the "Porky's" trilogy is beyond reproach.)</TE>
<TE>   What happened next, I can't be sure. My wife let loose with a
torrent of strange words that I can only liken to someone speaking in
Elven tongues.  Aragorn this, Boromir that.  Mordor this, Enron that.</TE>
<TE>   She brought forth her holy text, a beautiful red leather-bound
book with gold-letter engravings filled with detailed illustrations
and maps. I was dazzled and frightened by the breadth of her
knowledge of hobbits, elves and Ents. Frodo is Bilbo's first and
second cousin, once removed, and so on, and on and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the winds died down and quiet returned.</TE>
<TE>   I was stunned. Here was a woman who could tell you who begat whom
for about a billion fantasy characters but couldn't remember to put
the lid back on the peanut butter jar. Who was this person?</TE>
<TE>   Then, her laugh came back. Roaring back. She laughed and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I married you because of that book," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You were the closest thing to a Hobbit I could find on Upper
Earth."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out it wasn't my sense of humor that had led to our
exchange of vows. No, it was my squat build, my large hairy feet and
my innocent acceptance of Frodo as a pet name.</TE>
<TE>   "All right, I won't make fun of your cult status anymore," I said
touching her wedding band. "At least in front of you."</TE>
<TE>   We both stood there for a moment and beheld the power of rings.</TE>

<HD>Creed Keeps No. 1 Spot for 8th Week</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's pop album chart is singing the post-holiday blues. Yet
even though sales among the Top 10 albums were down an average of 20%
last week, Creed got some good news as its "Weathered" passed the
Beatles' "1" by logging its eighth straight week at No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of the Florida band's "Weathered" dropped from 166,000 to
138,000 last week, according to SoundScan, but in terms of time spent
at the top of the chart, Creed now joins Eminem ("The Marshall
Mathers LP," 2000) and 'N Sync ("No Strings Attached," 2000) at eight
consecutive weeks. The modern longevity record is held by the
"Titanic" soundtrack, whose record of 16 weeks in 1998 figures to
stay afloat for a long time.</LD>
<LD>   None of the albums in this week's Top 10 posted sales gains over
the previous week, but that's typical for this time of the year,
according to Wherehouse Entertainment senior pop buyer Bob Bell.
"Coming out of the Christmas season, sales are going to be down, and
the new release schedule really hasn't heated up yet," Bell said.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the only new album showing up in the Top 100 is the
soundtrack to the film "I Am Sam," which debuts at No. 25 with sales
of 36,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   The Top 10 remained relatively static, with Linkin Park, Ludacris,
Nickelback and Nas, respectively, occupying the chart positions below
Creed. The remaining Top 10 slots, in order, are held by Pink, Ja
Rule, Alicia Keys, the "Now That's What I Call Music" hits collection
and Enya.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest threat to Creed's chart domination arrived in stores
Tuesday--Alan Jackson's "Drive" album, which includes his hit song
responding to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, "Where Were You (When
the World Stopped Turning)."</TE>
<TE>   "First-day sales are incredibly strong," Bell said of the
collection. "I think it's got a good shot" at debuting at No. 1 next
week. If it does, it will be the first time the country singer has
entered the pop album chart in the top spot.</TE>
<TE>   "He obviously benefits from the lack of competition out there in
January, but it's also got a very timely song inspired by the events
of 9-11 that's really resonating with a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's top-selling single for the third straight week is
B2K's "Uh Huh."</TE>

<LD>   Supposedly, Hollywood doesn't make musicals anymore, but someone
forgot to tell Baz Luhrmann. A double bill of Luhrmann's most recent
film, "Moulin Rouge," and his first feature, 1992's "Strictly
Ballroom," highlights the Australian filmmaker's flair for mixing
flashy visuals with song-and-dance elements, both conventional and
reinvented. "Moulin Rouge," a solid contender in this year's Oscar
race, is a fever dream of musical spectacle, its dizzying visual and
melodic panache is operatic by intention and excessive by design.
Glamorous turns from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor as singing
star-crossed lovers in turn-of-the-century Paris lend the film a
classic touch. "Strictly Ballroom," a wised-up homage to the musicals
of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, manages to poke fun at and honor
the conventions of the genre.</LD>

dressy attire and with a shorter program. The 70-minute concert
includes Dmitri Shostakovich's First Symphony and pianist Alexander

<TE>   Two men are on death row for murder, one for killing a drug
dealer, the other--simple-minded and possibly insane--for burning
down a church, killing 37 African Americans. In Alliance Repertory
Company's West Coast premiere of the razor-edged drama "Coyote on a
Fence," playwright Bruce Graham explores questions surrounding
capital punishment: Do the men deserve the death penalty? Who are the
decision-makers? What is society's obligation? Presented with
alternating casts, the play features members of the 2001 Ovation
Award-winning ensemble from the company's revival of Richard
Greenberg's "Night and Her Stars."</TE>

<TE>   There are clear resonances and parallels between Michael Frayn's
recent Tony-winning play, "Copenhagen," currently at the Laguna
Playhouse, and Bertolt Brecht's modern classic, "Galileo." In
"Copenhagen," World War II-era Nobel-winning nuclear physicists
Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr are forced to confront the fact that
their zeal for pure science has led to mass slaughter in the form of
the atomic bomb. That same issue--the moral and historical impact of
scientific inquiry--prompted Brecht to revise a 1938 version of
"Galileo" after the bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Brecht's original "Galileo" envisioned a wily, resilient astronomer
who manages to outfox the Inquisition. That Galileo was seen keeping
scientific inquiry alive even as he publicly recanted his discoveries
that threatened biblical authority. The revised version offers a much
darker vision: This Galileo belatedly realizes that a commitment to
truth must be absolute and that recanting to save his life was an
abdication of responsibility that may have cost humanity a chance to
rise from ignorance and prejudice. "I surrendered my knowledge to the
powers that be to use it ... as it suits their ends," a defeated,
self-hating Galileo says at the end. "Any man who does what I have
done must not be tolerated in the ranks of science." This weekend's
readings of "Galileo" use the translation from German by Charles
Laughton for a 1947 production in which he played the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Galileo," presented by Readers Repertory Theater. Friday, 7 p.m.
at Mesa Verde Library, 2969 Mesa Verde Drive, Costa Mesa; Saturday, 7
p.m., at Mission Viejo Library, 25209 Marguerite Parkway; and Sunday,
1 p.m. at Vanguard Theatre Ensemble, 699A S. State College Blvd.,

<TE>   The famous Gilbert &amp; Sullivan frothiness is in full effect in "The
Gondoliers." The 1889 operetta concerns merry plyers of the Venetian
canals, the women who love them and a down-on-its-luck family of the
Spanish nobility that comes to Venice seeking to reverse its
fortunes. Gilbert's story and libretto lightly tweak both the
upper-crust pretensions of the aristocracy and the egalitarian
pretensions of the commoners. But mostly it's about clever silliness
and sumptuous music, with the inevitable happily contrived ending in
which all the right boys get all the right girls. Though not as
frequently performed today as "The Mikado," "The Pirates of Penzance"
or "H.M.S. Pinafore," "The Gondoliers" was rapturously received by
its original audiences and was the last big hit of Gilbert &amp;
Sullivan's increasingly thorny collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   "The Gondoliers," Chance Theater, 5576 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim
Hills. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Preview tonight,

<LD>   A Noise Within's critically acclaimed, 2001 revival of Noel
Coward's 1925 frivolity, "Hay Fever," returns for a short run prior
to going on tour. In this infectiously funny comedy of bad manners,
directed by Art Manke, hapless house guests of the prone-to-emoting,
bohemian Bliss family find their expectations for a romantic weekend
in the country thwarted by their hosts' squabbles and rather
unorthodox ideas of hospitality.</LD>

<TE>   Although he made his classical piano debut at Carnegie Hall at age

music--combining Latin rhythms with the most adventurous aspects of
jazz. Sharing a bill in Long Beach is the Brazilian husband-and-wife
team of percussionist Airto Moreira and singer Flora Purim, who has
worked with some of music's finest practitioners, including Miles
Davis, Stan Getz, Chick Corea and Weather Report.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Palmieri, Flora Purim &amp; Airto Moreira, Carpenter Performing

<TE>   Three Judy Garland impersonators have been murdered and the
evidence points to Kenny's class for drag performers-in-training.
That's bad news for homophobic LAPD Det. Mike Manley, who has to go
undercover, join the class and work up a credible Garland
impersonation of his own to collar the culprit. "Doing Judy," a world
premiere comedy by Dan Evans, is produced by Steve Gideon, who
starred in 1999's authorized gay version of Stephen Sondheim's "Marry
Me a Little" at the Celebration Theatre. It's directed by Tom Pardoe,
whose Broadway acting credits include "Miss Saigon" and "Beauty and
the Beast."</TE>

literary confessions and character studies, but don't expect things
to be all serious at his L.A. dates. He remakes the Edison Lighthouse
bubblegum classic "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" on his latest
album, and in recent concerts he's also taken a stab at such tunes as
Elton John's "Rocket Man" and Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light."</TE>

Fairfax Ave., L.A., 9 p.m. $16. (323) 852-1073. Also Sunday at

<TE>   Celebrating its 50th anniversary, Japan's Warabi-za Folk Dance and
Music Ensemble brings the West Coast premiere of "21st Century
Hiso--Flying Across the Pacific" to Little Tokyo. Half the program
focuses on work dances from land and sea (a company specialty) and
the other half on a regional sampling of antique Japanese traditions.
Feisty taiko drumming provides additional excitement, and Japanese
folk costumes are always a show in themselves. The company is based
in northeastern Japan, but gives most of its 1,000 performances a
year far from home. Incidentally, the word hiso means flying or
soaring: not a bad millennial ambition for any performer.</TE>
<TE>   Warabi-za Folk Dance and Music Ensemble, Japan America Theatre,
244 S. San Pedro St., L.A., 8 p.m. Also Sunday, 2 p.m. Workshop:

<LD>A Noise Within's critically acclaimed, 2001 revival of Noel Coward's
1925 frivolity, "Hay Fever," returns for a short run prior to going
on tour. In this infectiously funny comedy of bad manners, directed
by Art Manke, hapless house guests of the prone-to-emoting, bohemian
Bliss family find their expectations for a romantic weekend in the
country thwarted by their hosts' squabbles and rather unorthodox
ideas of hospitality.</LD>

Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7 p.m.; Wednesday-Jan. 25, 8 p.m.;

<TE>   A.R. Gurney wrote "Ancestral Voices" to be read by actors rather
than played as a fully staged performance. The script concerns the
turmoil in a well-heeled family of Northeasterners after Grandma
ditches Grandpa for Grandpa's best friend. Gurney felt it jumped
around too much in time and place to be successfully contained as a
traditional stage play. Rene Auberjonois, familiar to fans of "Star
Trek: Deep Space Nine" as the shape-shifting Odo, plays the
devastated grandfather; Fred Savage is no longer aboard as the
grandson/narrator, a role he played in this touring production in
October at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Emmy nominee Peter Scolari
takes his place. Other cast members are veteran stage and screen
actors Adrienne Barbeau, Katherine Helmond and Lawrence Pressman.</TE>

Rabbit." On display at the exhibition are unique animation cels and a

<TE>   Seven artists and two sculpture exhibitions will open at the
Irvine Fine Arts Center, offering a new way to look at the world.
"From Sculpture" is a group show of "drawings" derived from
sculptural works by Southern California artists Dean DeCocker, Matt
Driggs, Steve DeGroodt, Colleen Sterritt, East Coast artist Jason
Rogenes and Ewerdt Hilgemann of Amsterdam. The drawings reinterpret
the artists' three-dimensional sculptures through a range of media,
including pen and pencil and photo-based digital prints. The solo
show, "A Material World," by Los Angeles artist Lynn Aldrich includes
five new sculptures and large wall pieces made from accumulated items
such as corrugated plastics, nylon cable ties, garden hose and
aluminum cans.</TE>

loose in its auditorium. To kick off a yearlong program of
once-a-month free poetry nights, the Griffith Park institution has
invited Los Angeles poets Jerry Quickley and Carmen Vega to serve as
featured performers at Another West: Poets From Our Community.
Quickley is thrice winner of the Los Angeles Poetry Grand Slam and
twice a National Poetry slam finalist. Vega, whose work is in several
anthologies, is laboring now on a book of love poems. Each featured
poet has prowled the museum's collections in the company of a
curator, looking for inspiration amid the Autry's thousands of
artifacts from the actual and imagined American West. Sartorial
warning: Persons in black may be mistaken for Zorro.</TE>

<TE>   Born two years before the death of his legendary father John
Coltrane, Ravi Coltrane fearlessly elected to embark on a jazz
career, playing the same instrument, saxophone. At first, the son was
accused of cloning the father's style. But more recently, Ravi
Coltrane has begun to emerge with his own sound. With pianist Joanne
Brackeen, Coltrane performs two shows a night through Sunday at the
Jazz Bakery.</TE>

<TE>   Poetry</TE>
<TE>   It may be a home where the buffalo roam, figuratively speaking,
but tonight the Autry Museum of Western Heritage is letting poets
loose in its auditorium. To kick off a yearlong program of
once-a-month free poetry nights, the Griffith Park institution has
invited Los Angeles poets Jerry Quickley and Carmen Vega to serve as
featured performers at Another West: Poets From Our Community.
Quickley is thrice winner of the Los Angeles Poetry Grand Slam and
twice a National Poetry slam finalist. Vega, whose work is in several
anthologies, is laboring now on a book of love poems. Each featured
poet has prowled the museum's collections in the company of a
curator, looking for inspiration amid the Autry's thousands of
artifacts from the actual and imagined American West. Sartorial
warning: Persons in black may be mistaken for Zorro.</TE>
<TE>   Another West: Poets From Our Community, the Autry Museum of
Western Heritage, 4700 Western Heritage Way, L.A. 7-8:30 p.m. Free.

<TE>   Polyrhythmic, body-moving and expansive, Afrobeat became one of
the most widespread sounds in the 1970s world-music movement, thanks
to its charismatic messenger, the late Fela Kuti. The Nigerian icon's
drummer and music director, Tony Allen, was a key player, and decades
later he's teamed with young producer-musician Dr. L in Psyco on Da
Bus, whose debut album throws gospel, Eastern music, electronica,
jazz and other beats into the mix.</TE>

<LD>DJ Dave Orlando's set at the Lounge last Thursday was so hot, you
could see smoke coming off the dance floor. The hip-hop maestro
worked the crowd into a frenzy by playing uber-hot rap hits side by
side with Boy George and Madness. Guests of the WeHo nightclub
included P. Diddy, Chris Rock, the Black-Eyed Peas and hip-hop's
first cover girl, Darlene "the Queen" Ortiz. Oh yeah, it was hot in
the city that night.</LD>
<LD>   Had a smashing time at Yamashiro's in Hollywood with two punk rock
divas, music photographer Lisa Johnson and touring/events guru Keri
Lee. We timed it just right for a pinky fresh sunset.</LD>
<LD>   Omigod, the Camaro Club at the Viper Room on Monday night was a
rock star free-for-all. In the house to support the hot bands
Elemental and Memento (darn near a palindrome!) were such A-listers
as Disturbed, Mudvayne, Methods of Mayhem, the Cult and Orgy.</LD>
<TE>   Upcoming Camaro Club shows include next Monday's triple-header
with Sugarcult, Smear and the Living Things; the return of Guns N'
Roses' Duff McKagan's new band, Loaded, on Jan. 28; and Hand of Doom,
the radical Black Sabbath cover band fronted by Hole bassist Melissa
Auf der Mauer, on Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Viper Room, Eddie Spaghetti's acoustic romp on
Fridays may turn into a residency. The Supersuckers frontman, who
returns Jan. 25, bares it all in this solo routine.</TE>
<TE>   And, in between sets, our night scene's very own rock star,
Casper--from the Pleasure Seekers and Coyote Shivers' band--controls
the turntables, where he cranks up Hank Williams, Elvis, Patsy Cline
and Willie Nelson. Yee haw!</TE>

<DH>Princess Superstar, who adds high energy to her raps,
performs at the Knitting Factory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's a street-savvy wordsmith with an ear for a beat. A
groovalicious platinum blond who delivers her rhymes with a healthy
dose of raunch and enough sexual bravado to go mike to mike with the
boys. Her name is Princess Superstar, and if you thought Lil' Kim
cornered the market on sexy, you'd better think again. This lady may
seem like a tramp, but she's smart.</LD>
<LD>   The 28-year-old New Yorker, whose real name is Concetta Kirschner,
delights in the libidinous. On "Princess Superstar Is," her fourth
album (due in stores Jan. 29), she raps about everything from hiring
a gigolo to being a "Bad Babysitter" who fools around on the job.
While her songs are riddled with hip-hop conventions--sexual
braggadocio, name checks, tough talk--this sex-positive feminist
freshens the mix with sarcasm, sass and playful subject matter.</LD>
<LD>   Just don't call her the female Eminem or a white Foxy Brown.</LD>
<TE>   "What I do is not so much even the white girl rapper thing. It's
broader than that. I really just feel like I'm a musician," says
Kirschner, who not only pens her own lyrics, but also rhymes, sings,
plays guitar, builds beats and produces her records.</TE>
<TE>   That's to say nothing of her live show--a high-energy romp with
pep squad antics that works every inch of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes hip-hop shows can be a little bit boring," said
Kirschner, who performs Saturday at the Knitting Factory. "Everyone's
like, 'Yo! Wave your hands in the air.' I like to go crazy on stage.
I'm more punk rock in a way."</TE>
<TE>   When performing, the Princess has more costume changes than a
Broadway musical. Dressing up as characters from her songs, she vamps
as everything from a "naughty cheerleader" to a lounge lizard to a
pimp.</TE>
<TE>   Kirschner says she is happiest when she's on stage, but that
wasn't always the case. The first time she performed, she "was
totally standing still, and the audience was booing and throwing
things at me. I got really upset and mad. The next day I had a show
and totally went crazy. I threw myself into the audience.... I just
snapped."</TE>
<TE>   A New Yorker by way of Philadelphia, Kirschner moved to the Big
Apple at age 17 to pursue an acting and theater degree at New York
University, but realized her true calling was music when she couldn't
wait to get home from class to practice guitar. In the early '90s she
began recording, using two tape decks to mix beats since she didn't
own a sampler.</TE>
<TE>   By 1993, she had gotten her hands on a four-track and recorded a
demo tape of her singing and playing guitar on one side and "doing my
hip-hop thing" on the other.</TE>
<TE>   She made four copies, sending them to the College Music Journal,
Grand Royal magazine, Elektra Records and her parents. When CMJ
reviewed her tape as its "demo of the month" and listed her phone
number, the response was off the hook as major labels called to court
her.</TE>
<TE>   That was the beginning and end of her interest in signing with a
big record company. Kirschner won't say what labels she met with,
only that one advised her to give up rap, another said to quit guitar
and a third suggested she re-name herself Cream--an obvious attempt
to capitalize on the commercial potential of a pretty white girl who
can rap.</TE>
<TE>   Kirschner's scorn for major labels is apparent in many of the
songs on her four full-length records, starting with her
first--"Strictly Platinum," released on 5th Beetle Records in 1995.
It is also the main reason she formed her own label, A Big Rich Major
Label, in 1997. (She later changed the name to the Corrupt
Conglomerate when the music industry consolidated.)</TE>
<TE>   She's Keenly Aware of Credibility Battle</TE>
<TE>   The Princess is fiercely independent in other ways as well. She
takes to task anyone who wants to pigeonhole her or who dismisses her
act as a novelty. Being female and white in a predominantly male and
black medium, she is keenly aware of the double credibility battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only white girl in the spotlight right now doing it, so
that of course helps," says Kirschner, who attracted such top-shelf
collaborators as Kool Keith, Beth Orton and Bahamadia for "Princess
Superstar Is." "Where it hurts is that sometimes people think you
don't got skills just 'cuz you're white."</TE>
<TE>   But, she adds, "the proof's in the puddin' on my record."</TE>

<HD>A Hip Bar With a Twist of Cozy</HD>
<DH>At Vine in Hollywood, newfangled cocktails and
old-fashioned fondue attract an eclectic crowd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KASTLE WASERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fondue's star is on the rise. Not long ago, dented pots and stemmed
forks were a garage sale bargain. Now the melted-food fad is back on
the party map at Vine.</LD>
<LD>   One of the new bars-with-a-twist to open in the booming Hollywood
area, Vine is a relaxed yet hip oasis for the club-weary looking to
unwind over flame-warmed concoctions. And the trendy partyers need
not worry--this fondue has been updated out of the shag carpet and
wood paneling era.</LD>
<LD>   A clientele of rock 'n' rollers, dance club strays, fashionistas
and bar hoppers regularly checks into Vine to sip newfangled
cocktails and dip bread to the beat of resident deejays. The eclectic
crowd may be a reflection of the bar's owners, two couples with
credentials as L.A. fashion and night-life impresarios. Rose Apodaca
Jones, West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily/W Magazine and
her husband, Simon Jones, a former special projects manager to
designer Richard Tyler, are half the team. The other half represents
two of the hot projects on the Cahuenga corridor: designer Liz Khader
is co-owner of the boutique Blest, and her husband, Samir, is
co-owner and manager at Beauty Bar.</LD>
<TE>   Rose Apodaca Jones and her partners were looking to provide a
little nourishment and a relaxing club alternative. "I love that
sweaty punk rock feel," she says. "But we wanted someplace where you
can come and kick back, talk and eat."</TE>
<TE>   Fondue had a cozy appeal, and fostered the kind of intimacy that's
been missing on L.A.'s night scene. And while the menu is a bit
retro, the vibe is quite contemporary. The only kitschy throwback
touches are beanbag chairs in the upstairs lounge and some
'60s-inspired hanging lamps. A cadre of in-house deejays spin
up-to-the-minute grooves of soul, jazz, rock, ambient and hip-hop.
The owners also plan to book live acts in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   This fashionable take on fondue is a far cry from its origins.
Fondue--which means "to melt"--was a common dish among struggling
peasants in the French-speaking areas of Switzerland, who were trying
to make use of hardened cheese and stale bread. At Vine, chef Dave
Northrup develops new interpretations on the classic cheese (and
chocolate) standards. Veggies, cubed potatoes and bread pieces carry
the savory offerings such as bacon, cheddar and ale, bleu cheese and
truffle or spicy salsa. For meat eaters, skewers of marinated
chicken, beef and shrimp were recently added to the menu.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert fondues are served with strawberries, banana slices and
cubes of poundcake and brownies. Choices such as
marshmallow-and-caramel-layered rocky road, white chocolate and
raspberry swirl or peanut butter cup satisfy the sweet tooth.</TE>
<TE>   Northrup's constantly evolving menu occasionally borrows a few
ideas, such as the Perfect Ten Fondue (a Swiss cheese blend named
after actress Bo Derek who lent her recipe to the bar).</TE>
<TE>   The drink menu also gets creative. At present, the bar has only a
beer and wine license, which has forced the bartenders to experiment
with new taste sensations. They came up with their own drink list of
"sake-tinis"--martinis made with a flavored sake-style beverage
called Soju. The cocktails taste almost like the vodka version except
with a dry sweetness--think Jolly Ranchers hard candy in a glass.
According to Simon, the vanilla hazelnut martini and very berry
martini are the big sellers but customers have been known to work
their way down the drink list. "It takes awhile to get people to try
new things because they're fairly set in what they drink. But once
they've had one or two of these, they want to try more," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Though the owners plan to expand the bar, for now they enjoy the
vibe of being a beer-and-wine-only establishment. "The crowds that we
get here don't get wasted and tear things up," says Simon. "People
are still having a nice time, getting a good buzz but it's not
drunken debauchery."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday afternoons the bar opens at 2 p.m. for those looking for a
hair-of-the-dog and darkened setting.</TE>
<TE>   And Jones says that even though they serve food, she wants Vine to
be seen as a bar. "We thought maybe we would get an early crowd who
wants to eat," she says, "but we tend to do most of our fondue sales
from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. I suppose it beats Taco Bell."</TE>
<TE>   Vine, 1235 N. Vine St., Hollywood. Tuesday-Saturday, 7 p.m. to 2
a.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. Last fondue orders at 1 a.m. No
cover. Fondues, $8 to $20. (323) 960-0800.</TE>

<HD>Things Are Sizzling at ChoSun Galbi Barbecue</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd never believe we're supposed to be in a recession from the buzz
and bustle at ChoSun Galbi Korean barbecue. At 7:30 on a Tuesday
evening, diners waiting for tables pack the palatial reception area.
Cell phones chirp, private rooms bulge with parties, and in the
garden-like, open-air dining area beyond the heavy glass doors,
dozens of parties hover over the table-top grills, attending to
expanses of sizzling meat.</LD>
<LD>   This huge, new restaurant, the second ChoSun Galbi in Koreatown,
opened early last October and is already a major player in a
neighborhood where more than 450 Korean eateries are located. What's
the secret of its success? "Location, location, location" comes to
mind. ChoSun sits right across from the new, three-story Koreatown
Galleria, an extravaganza of boutiques in the heart of Koreatown's
swankiest district.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there's also the lure of the restaurant's dramatic
decor. Jutting beams, thick glass panes and curving, sliced-bamboo
walls generate a mood that's as much an attraction as the food.</LD>
<TE>   ChoSun may bill itself as a barbecue, but really it's an
all-purpose place with a comfort-food menu that's not particularly
ambitious. Shrimp and croaker fish join the usual meats for grilling;
the rest of the menu recites familiar stews, casseroles and noodle
dishes. Even the most conservative diners will find little that's
unfamiliar (except, perhaps, grilled beef intestines or raw
chile-marinated crab). The truly adventurous won't encounter eel
gonads or other such rarities that they can boast to their foodie
friends that they've eaten.</TE>
<TE>   My party of five assembled at a large table just off the reception
area. Almost immediately, the waitress began to dole out an imposing
assortment of small dishes--so many that they obscured the entire
tabletop, apart from the grill. Each of us got several styles of
kimchi and a salad, followed by an assortment of panchan, the dainty
accompaniments to almost every Korean meal. There were seaweeds in
multiple hues, assorted vegetable dishes and a bowl of long, green
chile peppers coated in a scalding-looking red chile sauce that was
as dazzling to look at as it was to bite into. Vivid shades of green,
flame-red and chile-tinged white spread over the table, creating a
nearly psychedelic effect.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing we would eat family style, we chose three different items
to grill. It soon became clear that on ChoSun's menu, "specially
formulated soy sauce" describes a wide variety of marinades. On
sliced pork (twaeji--here spelled daeji--bulgogi), it meant a
peppery-sweet marinade; on the ribs (kalbi), it was garlic-laden soy
sauce. Pulled from the grill still sizzling, both meats drew the most
enthusiasm. Samgyop sal, an uncured pork bacon, was less impressive,
even when sprinkled with its accompanying sauce, flavored with tiny,
fresh chiles, and wrapped in swatches of lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Dol sot bibim bap, crusty-bottomed rice served in a heavy, iron
casserole and topped with shredded beef, a rainbow of vegetables and
a fried egg, was best when revved up with a large dose of
sweetish-hot chile sauce, kochujang. Chogae-tang (here spelled
jokae-tang), a brisk, clean-tasting broth filled with just-steamed
clams, made an ideal contrast to our rich meats and all their garlic.</TE>
<TE>   High turnover means ChoSun's foods are always exceptionally fresh,
but also means regular lapses. One time, the tender rice pancake
studded with seafood (hae mul pa jeon), a wonderful dish that's often
an appetizer, didn't come till we'd eaten everything else. Still, the
ke jang, a sort of crab ceviche, is spectacular here--if you love
chiles and don't mind sucking meaty blue crab from its sauce-coated
shell.</TE>
<TE>   Some K-town regulars may know restaurants with more varied meats,
more inspired marinades or more opulent side dishes, or where the
grilling is done over real charcoal. They may favor some specialty
house for hot tofu soup, pig's knuckle or blood sausage
casserole.ChoSun's clientele probably knows of those places too. But
here they are, across from the Koreatown Galleria, eating ChoSun's
comforting foods.</TE>
<TE>   ChoSun Galbi #2, 3330 W. Olympic Blvd., L.A. (323) 734-3330. Open
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. Full bar. Complimentary valet parking
behind restaurant. All major cards. Dinner for two, food only $25 to
$43.</TE>
<TE>   What to Get: twaeji bulgogi, kalbi, dol sot bibim bap, hae mul pa
jeon, ke jang.</TE>

<LD>Outside Largo, they're lined up, as usual, waiting to see
singer-songwriter Jon Brion. His weekly musical free-for-alls are now
in the fifth year of a room-filling run on Friday nights. Despite the
obvious--that the place hasn't yet opened--several people ignore the
queue and try the door.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than mocking newcomers, as some in-crowds might do, the
regulars explain the drill: Dinner reservations? Stand to the left of
the black door. Seeking a spot in the limited standing room in the
120-capacity space? Join the longer line to the right.</LD>
<LD>   Wouldn't a sign help? "Yeah, but, the thing is, people steal stuff
like that," says fast-talking but low-key owner-booker Mark Flanagan.</LD>
<TE>   In July 1996, the 36-year-old impresario remodeled and reopened
the intimate nightclub wedged into a dense stretch of Fairfax Avenue
best known for its Jewish delis and bakeries. Since then, patrons
have made off with just about any Largo thing that wasn't nailed
down, including a sardonic sign that told people not to give the
doorman a hard time. Someone even tried to steal a picture of actor
Peter Sellers hanging in one of the restrooms. Nowadays, everything
is nailed down.</TE>
<TE>   That's not exactly the behavior you'd expect from Largo's
clientele--generally mild-mannered music and comedy fans--but then,
Largo isn't an ordinary club. It's the kind of spot that with luck
you'll stumble across, or hear about from a friend. No flashy
marquee, just a sign, a black door and a solid reputation. But once
you find it, chances are you'll go back. These days, the crowds come
from down the street, across town even around the country to see some
of the more eccentric, literate and critically acclaimed artists the
city has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when legendary L.A. nightspots exhibit little
personality, Largo has emerged as potent exception. It's shaped by
Flanagan, whose strategy is simple--booking his favorite acts. He
maintains full houses with this singular focus, even in the face of a
nightlife culture that shifts with the hot new trend.</TE>
<TE>   For performers, Largo feels like home, Flanagan is a friend, and
most return again and again. Some just stay. Currently in weekly or
monthly residencies are eccentric songwriter Joe Henry, Texas-born
KCRW fave David Garza and veteran troubadour Loudon Wainwright III.</TE>
<TE>   The club also attracts popular touring artists; Robyn Hitchcock
and Neil Finn, of Crowded House fame, have graced its small stage.
And the Monday night "Largo Comedy Show" features a caliber of
comedians whose jokes, aficionados say, are much more intelligent
than what's heard in the local laugh emporiums.</TE>
<TE>   Largo is, on the most fundamental level, an extension of Flanagan,
a Belfast native with a melodious Irish accent. The decorating
touches are the most obvious: the Celtic symbol above the low stage,
the portraits of favorite musicians and actors lining the walls, and
the back-corner "poet's gallery" portraying the likes of Samuel
Beckett, Brendan Behan and William Butler Yeats. But the vibe is
Flanagan's as well. Like its host, Largo is popular, but not trendy.
Classy, but not snobbish. Egalitarian, but not
lowest-common-denominator.</TE>
<TE>   When fans line up here, it's not to be part of the scene or rub
shoulders with beautiful people, as is often the case at other
intimate L.A. clubs. People come to this dim, rectangular,
burgundy-walled room to hear the music. And we do mean hear. Because,
unlike most of Hollywood's bar-chatter- and cell-phone-tolerant hot
spots, Rule No. 1 at Largo is: No talking during the performances.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone who plays at Largo comes in knowing about the rule.
When fresh-faced singer-songwriter John Mayer offers a short,
impromptu, Flanagan-requested set, he thanks everyone for being so
quiet. "Which you don't really have to do," he says, strumming an
acoustic guitar. "Or," he adds when the silence continues, "maybe you
do."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes. "With serious singer-songwriters, or even comedy, you
can't have a rowdy audience," says the cheerful, burly proprietor who
favors flannel shirts, casual pants, often sports a tweed cap and is
affectionately known as "Flannie." If people are talking, "I'll warn
them a couple of times," he says, "then I'll throw them out. I've
gone as far as buying people's dinners and giving back their cover
charge."</TE>
<TE>   His formula is simple, says L.A.-based singer-songwriter Aimee
Mann, who penned most of the tunes for Paul Thomas Anderson's
critically acclaimed 2000 film "Magnolia": He wants good music in his
club. "He recognized there was an audience for this kind of music,
[when] other people didn't think there was," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Proof walks in every night. Susan Parra has trekked from her Long
Beach home to see Brion almost every Friday since he started playing
there. She also attends shows by such Largo regulars as Phillips,
Henry and jazz pianist Brad Mehldau. Bobb, a Largo regular who goes
only by one name, comes for the music and likes that "there's not a
lot of attitude here." He started driving from Eagle Rock to see
Brion about two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bobb, Parra and other Largo habitues have made their niche, but
they're hardly an exclusive clique. In fact, they sound grateful for
a place where, as Parra puts it, "There's no velvet rope. It's not
about who you know. We never have to stand outside and wait while
celebrities breeze past."</TE>
<TE>   If you have a dinner reservation, you'll definitely get in. But be
prepared to call weeks in advance. Otherwise, it's first come, first
served. "I just don't like that Hollywood history of people being
able to march up to the front of the line and say, 'I'm Pee-wee
Herman,' or whatever," Flanagan says.</TE>
<TE>   And don't try scoring entry by claiming to know Flanagan--chances
are he's the "doorman" you're trying to convince. "At least twice,
I've been standing at the door, and someone has said, 'I'm a friend
of Flanagan.' One guy even said, 'Flanagan will be [ticked] if you
don't let me in!'"</TE>
<TE>   Largo's story and its place in the current music and club scene
are tied to Flanagan's history in L.A. A singer-songwriter
himself--although he'll not easily tell you that--Flanagan arrived
here from Boston a decade ago and quickly befriended some of the
musicians he has come to champion. The "black sheep" in a long line
of Irish bar owners, his initial plans involved continuing his
graduate work in psychology and medicine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Flanagan and two partners bought the club, then known as
Cafe Largo and Jean-Pierre Boccara, who went on to open and close
LunaPark. Right away, Flanagan had an ear for quality, bringing in
such artists as Brion, Grant Lee Buffalo and folk-poppers the Wild
Colonials. Despite the packed houses and visits by such celebrity
patrons as Dr. John and Branford Marsalis, he says, a year later his
partners decided to turn the place into a sports bar. So Flanagan
left and started booking his favorites into other clubs, including
the Troubadour and the now-closed Alligator Lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "The [outside] shows were OK, and we had good fun, but everyone
kept saying, 'We need a venue.'" In 1994, his ex-partners went
bankrupt, and Flanagan made plans to buy the club himself. Two years
and one economical remodeling job later, he was ready to do Largo his
way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the doors open, regulars stream to the dozen low-backed
stools around the gleaming, dark-wood bar at the rear. A staffer
tells Flanagan that some people who aren't dining will be sitting at
a side table until the reserved group arrives. Comically inept
magician the Amazing Ronaldo (Ron Lynch) who will be doing bits later
with Brion, asks if Flanagan has seen a short piece of rope needed
for his routine.</TE>
<TE>   Although the tables are so close together that some might say it
feels more claustrophobic than intimate, the arrangement is designed
(yes, by Flanagan) to maximize sight lines, optimize the sound and
minimize chatting. The dim yellow light is extremely flattering, but
so faint that, if you order one of the salads, pastas, pizzas or
entrees created by Italian chef Marco Lucrini, you may have a hard
time seeing the food on your plate.</TE>
<TE>   The room fills up as servers hurry back and forth. Music plays
over the sound system until the lights go even lower and comedian
Paul F. Tompkins gets up to rip on holiday movies for 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs in Flanagan's alley-view office, a plate of food awaits
him and a television silently transmits images. Across the truncated
hallway is the green room for the artists. The cramped space is
decorated with Christmas lights, vintage jazz posters, old Largo
fliers, Beatles pictures and other miscellany. The room twists back
under the eaves, almost Seuss-like, past a plastic-wrapped air duct,
and is filled with assorted unmatched furniture donated by various
benefactors. Despite the whimsical impression, there are also the
practical touches of a full-length mirror and a water dispenser.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, there is only one occupant: Brion. He's wearing his
tweed coat against the still-departing chill in the air. A
textbook-sized collection of Bob Dylan's lyrics sits on the coffee
table, soon to be joined by Brion's dinner plate.</TE>
<TE>   Brion, who has known Flanagan for a decade, compares his friend to
the record-label and movie moguls of old. "Instead of making
decisions by committee like they do now, those businesses used to
have one or two people at the top whose tastes determined
everything," he says. Indeed, Flanagan's faith in people's talent and
willingness to go with the flow has helped to make Largo a launching
pad for acts as diverse as alt-poppers Better Than Ezra and comic
rock duo Tenacious D.</TE>
<TE>   Such old-school magnates had the luxury of indulging themselves,
which is exactly what Flanagan did when he gave Friday nights to
Brion in the summer of 1996. Why? "I've never seen a performer like
Jon in my life," Flanagan says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brion is a solo artist with a penchant for writing gorgeous gems
that have the classic Beach Boys/Beatles melodiousness. A
multi-instrumentalist who plays such obscure items as optigan and
chamberlain along with more ordinary guitar, piano and drums, Brion
is also known for lending his playing and producing talents to such
Largo-friendly acts as Mann, Fiona Apple and Rufus Wainwright, as
well as Jakob Dylan's band the Wallflowers and electronica group
Crystal Method.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan's residency idea was a hard sell, even to artists without
overt commercial aspirations, who tend to complain bitterly about
being misunderstood and underappreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "He literally forced me to do it," says Brion, who had developed
his quirky style of performing--no set list, lots of audience
participation, comic interludes--while Largo was in limbo and
Flanagan was booking at other venues.</TE>
<TE>   The first week at Largo, Brion recalls, only 15 people showed up.
But Flanagan told him to wait. A few weeks later, 60 people came, and
a few weeks after that the club was full. It has stayed that way for
more than five year's worth of Fridays.</TE>
<TE>   On this Friday, the clanking of silverware and the clinking of
glasses have subsided by the time Brion takes the stage. In a room so
still you find yourself holding your breath without even realizing
it, he plays vaudeville-style piano while the Amazing Ronaldo goofs
on sleight-of-hand tricks; tosses off such requests as Cheap Trick's
"Voices in Your Head"; improvises music over recorded snippets of
Tompkins' routine; tweaks the upright piano's exposed innards for
percussive effect; and generally entertains a crowd that's clearly
ready for anything he throws at it.</TE>
<TE>   "That fun, communal feeling really enhances the atmosphere," Brion
says later. "You never know what's going to happen next."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it isn't just the customers who appreciate Largo's
differences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only thing that gives me a sense of community in Los
Angeles," says Mann. "You always know you can go back there to meet
new people and see old friends."</TE>
<TE>   Playing Largo also provided Mann and her musician husband, Michael
Penn, with the novel approach they applied to their 2000 concert
tours. During the many Largo shows they played both alone and in
tandem, they developed the quirky practice of having comics handle
their between-song banter on stage. "You would never be able to do
that any other place," Mann says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Booked by Lisa Leingang, a veteran of the SF Improv and NBC, the
"Largo Comedy Show," currently running twice a month, attracts a
similarly respectful crowd that's a little more boisterous and a bit
younger than the music fans, observes bartender Ellen Tunney. A
longtime employee like most of Largo's staff, Tunney met Flanagan a
few years ago when her husband, Eric, hosted Paul Greenberg's comedy
show "Bunk" at the club.</TE>
<TE>   Along with getting to see all the shows, Tunney likes how patient
the crowds are, even when it's busy, and the regulars. "There's a
different set for every night," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than being limited to Mondays, comics often open for the
singer-songwriters. That might seem odd to anyone who witnessed the
verbal abuse taken by comedians opening for rock acts in the '70s.
But, to Flanagan, it's quite sensible.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of singer-songwriters who don't write about the
happy things in life," Flanagan deadpans. "I mean, there's a sense of
humor in there, but you gotta dig deep for it. In Ireland, when I was
growing up, a comedian or a magician would often open for an artist.
So I thought it would be good to do that at Largo."</TE>
<TE>   Pretty much whatever Flanagan decides is good is what goes. If he
likes your act, he won't just let you do whatever you want. He'll
insist on it. Which is a far cry from nightclub owners who want to
first know how many customers an artist can draw.</TE>
<TE>   Take the up-and-coming Tuesday-night comedy and music bonanza
known as "The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show" featuring Dave (Gruber)
Allen, David Koechner, Tom Chan and J. P. Fitting. "In our show,
there's all this crazy stuff happening," says Allen, who is indeed
naked during his act and definitely unconventional--offering up a
sort of rambling discourse on life as a cross-country trucker,
layered with comedy and music. "Toward the end of it, we even joke
about the freedom. But that's exactly what we like about playing
[Largo]."</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, Flanagan's conviction provides a much-needed
boost. "Comedians are supposed to acquire more and more confidence to
be themselves on stage," says Tompkins. "Largo has helped me do that,
[whereas] the battle you fight in other places is to just get people
to pay attention." The downside, he says, comes "when you perform in
other places, and you don't get that kind of respect. It makes it
tougher to go out into the wild."</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes being at Largo is the catalyst, says Allen, whose
believes his group got noticed by the mainstream press directly as a
result of Flanagan's booking. "Sure, we're talented and funny and all
that stuff," he says, "but if we weren't at Largo, none of [the
attention] would've happened."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brion's set is winding down. Some people have slipped away into
the cold night, but most of the room is still riveted. Flanagan
continues to monitor, stopping to watch his friend amid a knot of
regular patrons, then making the rounds to ensure that everything is
as it should be.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan has had numerous offers from people wanting to buy Largo,
or to move it to a larger space. But he likes things they way they
are. "If I preserve the integrity of it, there's no way it can't do
well," he says. "And people like Grant [Lee Phillips, of Grant Lee
Buffalo] and Jon and David are ever-evolving," he says. "You always
want to come back and see what they're up to." At least it's a sure
thing that Flanagan does.</TE>

<HD>When Visiting New York City, Go Ouest</HD>
<DH>The cozy French restaurant on the Big Apple's Upper West
Side is creating a buzz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Planning trips to New York, most of us tend to think about the top
restaurants we'd like to try. For most, even now, that means calling
sometimes weeks in advance to secure a reservation. In Manhattan, if
you want to dine at Babbo or Craft or the hot new Ilo anytime before
10 p.m., it takes perseverance and the crowds sometimes seem to have
more tourists than New Yorkers.</LD>
<LD>   Eating at a neighborhood place like 71 Clinton on the Lower East
Side or the tiny bistro Prune in the East Village lets visitors in on
a more intimate side of New York. Greenwich Village and Soho, of
course, are crammed with appealing small restaurants, some of which,
like the late-night Blue Ribbon, don't even take reservations. Until
now, other than take-out smoked fish from Zabar's or Murray's, the
Upper West Side was sadly lacking anyplace you or New Yorker friends
who love to eat would long to visit for dinner.</LD>
<LD>   The buzz on the new restaurant Ouest (that's west in French) from
chef Tom Valenti, though, has been tremendous. Valenti was chef at
the late Dominic's and Butterfield 81, and wherever he's cooked, the
food has been good.</LD>
<TE>   Unbelievably, I had to make a reservation two weeks in advance to
get a table at 8:30 p.m. A friend who lives two blocks away still
hasn't been able to get in because he's always trying on the spur of
the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Let me say that I loved this place--despite the 20-minute wait
squeezed with dozens of others into a long, narrow space, which is
sort of a hallway with a bar along one side and a maitre d's podium
at the far end. It was hot. It was noisy. It was fun.</TE>
<TE>   Here, on the Upper West Side, you get a different kind of
celebrity, the kind you recognize from book jackets.</TE>
<TE>   We ate in a cheerful, cozy dining room with high ceilings, red and
orange silk-shaded lamps and curvaceous, red Naugahyde booths, but
there are tables in an upstairs mezzanine, too, and booths behind the
bar.</TE>
<TE>   To start, try the mustard-crusted pork "rillette," shredded pork
patties served with a warm Yukon potato salad. Supple slices of
smoked duck breast are topped with a warm poached egg that's been
deep-fried to crisp it. And the chef makes a mean butternut squash
agnolotti bathed in Parmesan broth with confit of duck gizzards.
Interesting stuff, eh?</TE>
<TE>   For the conservative crowd, the menu lists a handful of simple
grills. For the rest of us, Valenti offers a wonderful sauteed skate
with braised cabbage in a tomato chive broth and a rustic braised
honeycomb tripe with lots of tomato in it and a small dish of
homemade hot sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Braised short ribs are a good bet, too, accompanied by baby
turnips and soft polenta.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, he's got nightly specials (as in plats du jour) like whole
roasted fish, rack of lamb for two and braised lamb shanks, which
are, I'm presuming, so good they've devoted two nights to the dish.</TE>
<TE>   On a Friday night, the place felt so festive and fun, it was easy
to feel part of the neighborhood--and New York at large.</TE>
<TE>   Ouest, 2315 Broadway, New York, N.Y.; (212) 580-8700. Open daily
for dinner; brunch on Sundays. Appetizers $7 to $11; main courses $16
to $25.</TE>

<LD>Hmmm. It's the right theater. We're here to see "Funky Punks With
Junk in Their Trunks," and that's what the sign at Burbank's Falcon
Theatre says. The program handout says the same, and some pretty zany
clowns were out in the lobby a few minutes ago. Inside the theater,
though, after a nifty opening act with a good-looking juggling duo
called the Tweaksters, some clown comes out and starts sweeping up
the stage, looking surprised to see us still in our seats.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the show," he says, making shooing motions.</LD>
<LD>   Kids in the audience beg to differ, and the clown, trying to
please, balances his mop on his chin. Does a hat trick. Pretends to
walk downstairs.</LD>
<TE>   "That's my show," he says politely, after each bit.</TE>
<TE>   But it seems that this audience won't take the hint, so bowing to
the inevitable, the clown walks over to that big pink trunk on stage,
lifts the lid and calls for reinforcements. A bunch of rowdy clowns
comes tumbling out, and so begins Troubadour Theater Company's
feel-good, funny, sunny delight for all ages.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble--Matt Walker, Travis Clark, Luke Fuller, Andy Lopez,
Guillermo Robles, Jordan Savage, Jenifer Jean Snyder, Michael
Sulprizio and Mike Teele--marches to its own Tin Pan Alley, disco,
rock 'n' roll and funk beat. Directed by Walker, these goofy clowns
romp all over the stage and in the audience, climbing over seats,
whacking badminton birdies, engaging in ring tosses and gathering up
volunteers--especially dad and uncle types--for balancing feats,
playing jump-rope with two stilt walkers, a hilarious "chair drill"
and a rocky white-water rafting trip. A squirt gun and a pail of
water figure prominently in that one.</TE>
<TE>   The Tweaksters return, too, for more gracefully choreographed,
balletic movement and comic juggling, and in the wild-and-woolly
encore, clowns go flying in high-energy, risky tumbling runs.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which premiered at Hollywood's big outdoor Ford
Amphitheatre last summer, has been tightened up for the smaller,
indoor Falcon space, but it hasn't lost its Marx Brothers-type
anarchy, or its deceptively casual, flying-by-the-seat-of-its-pants
zany charm.</TE>
<TE>   Known for its musical commedia dell'arte spins on the classics,
Troubadour is also reprising its show for grown-ups at the Falcon,
"Romeo Hall &amp; Juliet Oates"--Shakespeare with a Hall &amp; Oates, 1980s
flavor.</TE>

Riverside Drive, Burbank, Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m. Runs
indefinitely. $10. (818) 955-8101. Running time: 1 hour.</TE>

<LD>The comedian stars on WB's "The Steve Harvey Show" and has a new book
out.</LD>
<LD>   NBA Live: I like the Garden of Eden on Sundays. There's usually a
fun crowd, a lot of basketball players there. The Lakers usually show
up after their games. They have a nice patio-deck area with a
fireplace, and if you've got some pull, the managers will actually
set up a PlayStation 2 and you can sit out there on the couches by
the heat lamps and play NBA Live.</LD>
<LD>   Board Games: When I was younger, you would have never caught me
playing Pictionary or Scrabble or any of these little games. But now,
it's good for me to sit down. I play those kinds of games a lot with
other couples. You just find yourself in these weird situations and
you go, "I'm grown, that's obviously why I am sitting here and
playing this game with y'all."</LD>
<TE>   Popping Up Onstage: A young comedian that I performed with on my
tour has a comedy night at the Hollywood Casino. It doesn't have that
Hollywood kind of pretentiousness, and at the same time the comedians
are in there working very hard to be funny. For me, it's a good place
to just pop up onstage and work out some things, when I'm not really
ready for that material to be out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buying Shoes: My wife is a big fan of window shopping and if I'm
with her, she's actually doing some real shopping. She's going to
have me pull out the credit card. She can go from mall to mall to
mall, just back to back. Me, once I've decided that these are the
shoes I want, that's it, I'm ready to go.</TE>

<HD>'Sam' Bequeaths a Legacy of Laughs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An astute critic once pointed out that the most successful television
sitcoms revolve around a group of fantastically disparate people who
gradually coalesce into a "family."</LD>
<LD>   That standard comes to mind when viewing Ray Proscia's "Imitating
Sam," the inaugural production for Chautauqua Theatre Alliance at the
Egyptian Arena Theatre. Proscia, who also co-produced and plays a
central role, sets "Sam" in a Brooklyn bar. Although reasonably
well-structured, with solid laughs and a few well-jerked tears, the
play often feels like an amplified sitcom, filled with relentlessly
eccentric characters who interact more for comic effect than dramatic
veracity.</LD>
<LD>   Peggy McCay, familiar to television audiences as Caroline Brady on
the daytime serial "Days of Our Lives," stars as Mary Anne
McNeill-Rothstein, whose husband, Sam, the owner of a neighborhood
pub, has just died.</LD>
<TE>   When Irish Catholic Mary Anne married Jewish Sam years ago, their
families mutually disowned them. Maybe that's why big-hearted Sam
made a habit of adopting "orphans" in similar situations, offbeat
characters such as Terry (ANT), a flamboyantly gay hairdresser, and
Al (Proscia), a reformed drunk with a prison record, both of whom
live in apartments upstairs from the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Sam's longtime bartender, Al still carries a blazing torch for
Sara (Gail Godown), Sam and Mary Anne's now-married daughter, who
arrives for the funeral, and winds up reevaluating her marriage and
her life.</TE>
<TE>   Unaware of Sam's sudden passing, Tanya (Glenda Redfield), an
African American professor and her younger Caucasian husband, Cubby
(Ric Coy), show up at the bar, ready to move into the apartment Sam
promised. But this "orphanage" is about to be closed, and when Sara
approaches his estranged aunts Rona (Lynda Lenet) and Cheryl (Gail
Johnston) for help, the outraged Mary Anne threatens to disown her.
Can differences be settled and the estate saved in time for a happy
ending?</TE>
<TE>   Director Richard Hochberg approaches this broad material with
appropriate boldness, but his staging would have benefited from more
restraint here and there. Under Hochberg's tutelage, the actors
certainly don't hold back. When first introduced, Redfield goes so
far over the top that we wonder why these folks just don't call the
cops on her. Lenet's initial moments are similarly strident.</TE>
<TE>   Energetic McCay was rocky on her lines the first weekend of the
run, and Proscia seems oddly miscast as Sara's macho Italian admirer.
Among the parade of stereotypes, ANT manages to bring depth to his
wry gay-guy persona.</TE>
<TE>   Godown is authoritative, the calm center of the play's lunatic
fringe, although why costume designer Janet Teller dresses her in a
micro-mini that threatens Godown's propriety every time she sits down
is a mystery. Scot Renfro's bar set is rendered in wonderfully seedy
detail.</TE>
<TE>   "Imitating Sam," Egyptian Arena Theatre, 1625 N. Las Palmas Ave.,
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Feb. 10.
$18. (323) 960-8865. Running time: 2 hours, 10 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Ohlsson Divines Chopin's Moods</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While it wouldn't be fair to tag Garrick Ohlsson as a Chopin
specialist--his repertory and sympathies are too wide for that--he
has not exactly discouraged it, having spent a good deal of the 1990s
performing complete cycles of the composer's solo piano music. And
Chopin--and nothing but Chopin--was what Ohlsson brought to the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Tuesday night, replacing the duo of Martha
Argerich and Nelson Freire, who canceled their tour last fall, on the
Philharmonic's Celebrity Recital Series.</LD>
<LD>   Ohlsson cut a wide path through a slew of Chopin genres--taking in
the five Opus 7 Mazurkas; six Etudes from Opus 25; the comparatively
rare Introduction and Rondo, Opus 16; the Prelude in C sharp minor,
Opus 45; and Ballade in A flat; with the Sonata No. 3 acting as an
anchor. He seemed to gear his interpretive approach toward a peak of
extroversion down the stretch, culminating in the splashy fireworks
of the close of the Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise, with three
of Chopin's best-known waltzes (in E flat, C sharp minor, and the
D-flat "Minute Waltz") for dessert.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps with this pacing in mind, the Sonata, placed early in the
program's first half, received a mostly restrained, overly
contemplative performance--it needed more turbulence--and the rhythms
of the Mazurkas were too willfully distorted. Yet in the Introduction
and Rondo after intermission, Ohlsson's playing took on a clarity and
force that had been lacking previously, and he arrived at the peak of
his powers in the Etudes, with a beautifully shaded, exquisitely
light-fingered treatment of what program annotator Orrin Howard
puckishly calls "those damnable thirds." From this point onward,
Ohlsson could do no wrong; his Andante Spianato was a poised beauty,
with just the right touch of rubato, and the waltzes had freedom,
delicacy and even good humor.</TE>

<HD>Leadership Doesn't Match Musicianship</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are many ways to lead a jazz group. Some ensembles simply serve
as backup for a virtuosic frontman. Others are vehicles for a
leader's compositional efforts. And still others are attempts to
produce fully balanced musical aggregations, in which the leader's
primary accomplishment is placing the best musicians in the most
felicitous setting for making prime improvisational art.</LD>
<LD>   From the first perspective, bassist John Patitucci is a highly
gifted virtuoso, his experience stretching back to gigs with Chick
Corea, Stan Getz, Freddie Hubbard and others. His compositions,
however, do not quite rise to the level of his playing, and his
capacity to create a balanced, musically integrated ensemble is still
in the early stages of development.</LD>
<LD>   Patitucci's individual work Tuesday in the opening of a six-night
run at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill was generally first-rate. A solo
excursion through bassist Oscar Pettiford's "Bohemia After Dark" was
a finger-flying display of his remarkable technical skills. But, on
this tune in particular, one couldn't help but recall how much more
musically compelling the late, legendary Pettiford managed to be,
while using so many fewer notes.</LD>
<TE>   Patitucci's compositions, most tracing to his current album,
"Communion," ranged widely. "Calabria" had a lovely, atmospheric
quality, its floating harmonies and top-of-the-horn improvising by
tenor saxophonist Tim Ries reminiscent of Charles Lloyd's recordings
from the '60s. But "Choro Luoco," a Brazilian forro dedicated to the
veteran composer Hermeto Pascoal, lacked the visceral energy one
associates with this high-spirited, improvisational style.</TE>
<TE>   The ensemble Patitucci led included Ries, the superb Venezuelan
pianist Ed Simon (playing far too few solos) and drummer Antonio
Sanchez. (Drummer Horatio "El Negro" Hernandez was not present, his
previously announced appearance the result of a communications mix-up
between the group management and the club.) Although the inherent
solo firepower in this impressive lineup exploded convincingly from
time to time, there was little sense of the sort of intuitive,
interactive spontaneity that is the hallmark of the best jazz
collectives. And what the set made clear was the fact that Patitucci
has a few giant steps to go before his leadership skills match his
individual musical virtuosity.</TE>

<LD>Mix a bunch of juggling, clowning and just plain goofing around,
throw in a lot of nifty singing and guitar and banjo playing, then
add a dash of history and you've got "200 Years of American
Music"--albeit much abridged--a dandy little family show presented by
the Razzle Bam Boom duo at the Secret Rose Theatre in North
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Zipping by in under an hour, with more comic zest and celebratory
spirit than historical heft, the show is pretty nigh impossible not
to clap and sing along with as the entertaining duo--Mark Beckwith
and Obediah Thomas--serves up a sampling of songs from "Yankee Doodle
Dandy" to "The Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B,"  and the 1980s
disco anthem, "YMCA."</LD>
<LD>   A longtime children's recording artist and educational performer,
the button-down Beckwith provides a strong, versatile baritone and
slick instrumentals on acoustic and electric guitar and banjo. He's
straight man to Thomas, a professional stand-up, juggler and trumpet
player, a likable and polished performer whose wacky song
interpretations include a jug-blowing, hambone-slapping Cajun grandpa
and a high-kicking, top-hatted Broadway belter. He's the visual
aid--in enormous, pillowy shoes--when Beckwith sings Fats Waller's
sassy "Your Feet's Too Big" and in one of the best bits, Thomas meets
Beckwith's challenge to juggle in various musical styles, from punk
rock to Hawaiian.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of adult volunteers are recruited for other funny bits,
and they've got to be as game as the dad and mom types who took the
stage during the opening matinee, because one joins Beckwith and
Thomas for an Andrews Sisters number in blond wigs and skirts, and

<TE>   Two minor irritants at Saturday's opener: the pint-sized heckler,
apparently unsupervised, who sounded off periodically during the
duo's "Smothers Brothers-style" banter and could have used a stronger
squelching from the good-natured pair, and Beckwith's two mid-show
plugs for the upcoming release of his and Thomas' related CD. A
mention at the end of the show would be classier.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, however, this is one kids' show that's as much fun for
adults as their offspring.</TE>
<TE>   "200 Years of American Music," Secret Rose Theatre, 11246 Magnolia
Blvd., North Hollywood, Saturdays at 1:30 p.m. Ends Jan. 26. Adults,
$10; children, $7; PTA parents receive a 50% discount. (818)

<LD>   "Grand Master: The Films of Stanley Kubrick"--The American
Cinematheque's retrospective ends Saturday with the documentary
"Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures" and the director's last film,
"Eyes Wide Shut." The latter, completed just before his death and
starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a married couple who stumble
onto the edge of a terrible moral abyss, is a strange, somber and
troubling meditation on jealousy, obsession and (yes) sex and death.
More European than Hollywood in tone, it's half brilliant, half banal
but always the work of a master director whose output has gotten
increasingly distant and self-involved over the years, and not always
to our benefit.... But when Kubrick, as in the dark and unnerving
film-within-a-film orgy scene that is "Eyes Wide Shut's" centerpiece,
cuts words to a minimum and uses pure cinematic technique to go to
the core of his emotions, what results has the powerful, lacerating
impact of inescapable nightmare. This is finally a film that is
better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you
when it's making the least amount of sense.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a clever little prologue by a Sister Alfred, delivered with
properly grave Hitchcockian monotone by the rotund Scott Dittman.
Bruce W. Gilray and Richard T. Witter have crammed into it a plethora
of Hitchcock and Hollywood references. Unfortunately, this is the
best part of their Agatha Christie whodunit parody and tribute to
Hollywood glamour days, "And Then There Was Nun" at the Knightsbridge
L.A. Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   During the play, more movie names are dropped as the 10 nuns are
slowly knocked off during a weekend retreat at Grauman's Chinese
Island. During this name-dropping game, the ensemble gives uneven
caricatures of Hollywood glitterati.</LD>
<LD>   Some of these references will fly higher than Sister Bertrille
over your head if you're not familiar with Tinseltown lore. Sally
Field doesn't make an appearance, although some of the lines in this
play are as embarrassing as Fields' "you like me" Oscar acceptance
speech.</LD>
<TE>   Victoria Hoffman as Sister Vivien (Leigh) at her Scarlett O'Hara
best despite being limited to the conservative black-and-white of
holy life and Pyeshon Omar Jackson as the no-nonsense nun, Sister
Hattie (McDaniel), give charmingly watchable characterizations.
Trisha Melynkov's Sister Katharine (Hepburn) captures the
determination undeterred by the tremulous shake of Parkison's
disease. Debbi Baron is a cheery Sister Judy (Garland).</TE>
<TE>   Other characterizations utterly fail to capture the illusion of
the stars. Director Hugh Harrison lets this semi-drag affair drag on,
perhaps hoping for laughs where there aren't any. Last year's flawed,
but funny "There's No Place Like Hollywood" was better at campily
capturing the essence of the parodied stars. This trifle is nun too
pleasing nunsense.</TE>
<TE>   "And Then There Was Nun," Knightsbridge Theatre Los Angeles , 1944
Riverside Drive, L.A. Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Feb.
24. $22. (626) 440-0821. Running time: 2 hours.</TE>

<LD>   Initial Autopsy on Demme Inconclusive</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy conducted on film and television director Ted Demme
("Blow," "A Lesson Before Dying") has proven inconclusive.</LD>
<TE>   The 38-year-old filmmaker, a nephew of director Jonathan Demme,
collapsed during a celebrity basketball game at the Crossroads School
last Sunday. He was rushed to Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center in
full cardiac arrest and pronounced dead 20 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe Demme died of natural causes, Los Angeles
County coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said. But toxicology tests
and further scrutiny of Demme's medical history, which could take up
to six weeks, could provide a definitive answer.</TE>

<TE>   CNN's 'Sexy' Ad</TE>
<TE>   CNN's Paula Zahn, addressing a semiannual gathering of TV critics
and reporters in Pasadena on Wednesday, called an in-house ad that
touted her as "just a little sexy" a "gaffe" by the cable news
network's promotion department. She sought to downplay the
controversy it triggered, calling the short-lived ad "just one really
bad promo that got on the air."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow CNN anchor Aaron Brown also took shots at the promo for
Zahn's "American Morning With Paula Zahn." "Dumb is dumb," he said.
"But it's a misdemeanor dumb. It's not like we committed some
journalistic gaffe."</TE>
<TE>   'Sopranos' Among Writers Guild Nominees</TE>
<TE>   Three episodes of HBO's "The Sopranos," two installments of NBC's
"The West Wing" and an episode of CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" have been nominated by the Writers Guild of America as
the best-written episodic drama of the 2000-2001 television season.</TE>
<TE>   In the episodic comedy category, Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle" and
HBO's "Sex and the City" received two nominations each, with one
apiece for CBS' "Everybody Loves Raymond" and Fox's "Titus." Winners
will be announced March 2.</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   $20 Million More for San Diego Symphony</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Symphony will receive an additional $20 million from
Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs and his wife, Joan, who last week
announced they are pledging $100 million to the group--the largest
single donation to a U.S. orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The additional money will go toward operating expenses that will
tide the organization over until the endowment generates interest.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said he hopes his contribution will help attract new
musicians and a "very good" conductor to replace Jung-Ho Pak, whose
contract expires this year. He also mentioned improving the concert
hall and expanding educational outreach programs.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The syndicated talk show "Iyanla," hosted by self-help author
Iyanla Vanzant, has been canceled. Reruns will air through March....
Steven Spielberg will get the lifetime achievement award at the
ShoWest convention for movie exhibitors on March 7.... In her first
scheduling decision, newly appointed ABC Entertainment President
Susan Lyne is tabling "Once and Again" until March 4, when it will be
moved from Fridays to Mondays at 10 p.m., a time slot in which it had
run once before.... Music director Jeffrey Kahane has extended his
contract with the L.A. Chamber Orchestra through the 2004-5 season.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Director Maria Ripoll and screenwriters Ramon
Menendez, Tom Musca and Vera Blasi have stirred a fine "Tortilla Soup,"
transposing Ang Lee's 1994 Oscar-nominated "Eat Drink Man Woman" from
Taipei to East Los Angeles with the greatest of ease. Hector Elizondo
heads a terrific ensemble cast as a long-widowed eminent chef and
traditional patriarch who needs to let go of his grown daughters
(Jacqueline Obradors, Elizabeth Pena and Tamara Mello). With a
scene-stealing Raquel Welch as a husband-hunting glamour puss. Warm,
funny and wise, the film is worth sipping.</LD>

<HD>The Golden Globes, After a Pause, Plans Annual Party</HD>
<DH>Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. puts its gala in perspective,
but also wants glitz and glamour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM O'NEIL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood usually likes nothing better than a chance to celebrate
itself, but Sept. 11 prompted a change in perspective that resulted
in the cancellation of two kudo-fests--the Latin Grammys and the
Blockbuster Entertainment Awards--and a twice-delayed Emmy ceremony
that was decidedly subdued.</LD>
<LD>   With Sunday's Golden Globes upon us, however, the mood that
prompted the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences to forgo tuxes and
elegant gowns in favor of "dressy business attire" at the Emmys seems
to have swung back in the other direction.</LD>
<LD>   The Globes are not only encouraging stars to put on the glitz this
Sunday, but there are no plans to scale back the bacchanalian bash
that surrounds the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.'s serious business
of honoring what its 90-odd members decide are the best film and TV
accomplishments of 2001--and attracting the largest possible audience
for NBC.</LD>
<TE>   The question begs: Is it unseemly for Hollywood to return to
partying as usual with bombs still raining on parts of Afghanistan,
and, for that matter, with New York and Washington still grieving?</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences suspended its
banquet-style festivities during World War II, the television and
recording academies during Vietnam. None of those awards groups
scrapped their parties altogether--indeed, their feasts were merely
pushed out of the public eye into post-ceremony celebrations--but
times of national crisis have dramatically altered the nature of what
the public perceives as a typical show-biz awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the established galas, only the Globes still showcase
attendees popping bubbly and chowing down gourmet fare while patting
winners on the back before a TV audience of millions.</TE>
<TE>   When stars arrive at the Beverly Hilton Hotel Sunday, they're
expected to step out of stretch limos--baubles sparkling--while
dressed in the latest Corneliani and Vera Wang. When they settle down
at banquet tables inside, nominees can calm their jitters with sips
of Moet Chandon Champagne, while on china plates in front of everyone
will be artful servings of banana squash, purple potatoes, sea bass
sauteed in port wine, and beef tournedos persilles on artichoke and
truffles ragout. For dessert, there's a miniature Golden Globe
chocolate medallion.</TE>
<TE>   Is it time to put a stop to this extravagance?</TE>
<TE>   "No!" declares Entertainment Weekly awards writer Dave Karger.
"The glitzy fashions, wild antics and dirty jokes while champagne
flows--they're all key parts of the Golden Globes' character. This is
Hollywood's annual family reunion--that one time when the film and TV
people all get together and do what most families do. They have a
lavish dinner, a big party, and, because TV cameras are there, we're
all invited."</TE>
<TE>   "The circus atmosphere is one of the reasons that people love the
Globes," says "Good Morning America's" movie critic, Joel Siegel.
"The Globes acknowledge with a wink what we all know--that, to some
extent, these award shows are ridiculous. The Globes are set up in a
way that tells us that they're in on the joke."</TE>
<TE>   But is such a fancy frat party appropriate after Sept. 11? "The
show must go on," insists Good Housekeeping etiquette expert Peggy
Post. "We must be respectful of people's feelings, yes--we're at war
and people are still stunned--but we have to carry on with our lives
and some gaiety and excitement are fine."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter appearing in this year's official Globes program,
Dagmar Dunleavy, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., asks
attendees "to pause and remember those whose light was extinguished
on Sept. 11th," but stresses that the Globes' starlight will not be
dimmed.</TE>
<TE>   "When life gets dreadful, there's nothing more wonderful than
getting a few hours of reprieve to have some fun," she says. "Just
don't go crazy and cross a line," warns manners guru Post.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But crazy is just what the Globes have been in years past. Jack
Nicholson never mooned anybody at the Oscars, but when he accepted a
best-actor trophy for "As Good as It Gets" in 1998, he thrust his
derriere at the audience (while keeping his trousers up) and
pretended to talk out of his bottom end. Decades earlier Joan
Crawford shocked a Globes audience when she did a Marilyn
Monroe-style shoulder jiggle on stage, purring, "I'll show a pair of
golden globes!" The joke is remembered as such a classic in Globe
lore that Bette Midler repeated it 20 years later.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony began in the mid-1940s as a stuffy affair presided
over by HFPA members who insisted upon hogging the spotlight and
dispensing the statuettes themselves. By 1958, however, the bored
audience mutinied. Rat Packers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy
Davis Jr., lifted their cocktails and cigarettes in the air like
sabers and ambushed the stage where they passed out the rest of the
trophies with hilarious efficiency. Their antics were such a hit that
HFPA leaders invited them back the next year to do it again.</TE>
<TE>   Liquor has played a key part in the Globes' bohemian legend,
having fueled many of its highest--and lowest--times. In the old
days, ceremony attendees could usually count on boozy outbursts from
the likes of Rita Hayworth and Judy Garland, but those scenes were
usually funny. No one was laughing the night Crawford, appearing a
bit woozy as she commandeered the podium, launched into an
obscenity-laced tirade while taking on some Sinatra hecklers.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Globe antics are tame by comparison. "Times have changed,"
Siegel notes. "Now I see stars bring their own bottles of designer
water in to the ceremony instead of a favorite scotch."</TE>
<TE>   Nonliquid mind-altering substances have played a star role at past
fetes, too. In 1979, as "Midnight Express" snared six Globes, Variety
reported that screenwriter Oliver Stone "did his best to snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory." As he accepted a prize for his
script, Stone "launched into a rambling polemic equating U.S.
treatment of imprisoned drug users with the injustice depicted in
'Midnight Express,'" Variety reported.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting people in jail for being high!" Stone inveighed at
the shocked audience, which erupted into boos. "Every person should
have the right to pursue his own happiness."</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra struck up loud music to drown out Stone, while
ceremony host Chevy Chase whispered loudly to him, "Just say 'thank
you' and leave the stage!" but Stone refused. It was only when
security guards approached the podium that Stone wrapped up quickly,
flashed a victory sign and trotted back to his seat.</TE>
<TE>   At the Oscars a few months later, Stone accepted an academy prize
politely and didn't raise a ruckus.</TE>
<TE>   The Globes may have a randy--even rowdy--reputation, but one group
of respected show-biz leaders recently did their best to copy them
while inaugurating their own award. The American Film Institute not
only bestowed prizes for both film and TV at its new ceremony, but
they summoned winners to the stage from nearby banquet tables. There
was, however, one key difference.</TE>
<TE>   "After the show I heard complaints from stars who were furious
that the liquor was shut off as soon as the awards presentation
began," Karger says. "The Globes would never do that--and that's
probably one of the reasons why they'll never have the problem of
celebrity no-shows that the AFI ceremony did."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but no-shows at the AFI event also may have had something
to with the fact that the event took place so soon after New Year's.
More likely it was because it was the first televised ceremony of the
AFI Awards, which are only in their second year.</TE>

<HD>It's 5' Times Two as Kang Opens in West Hollywood</HD>
<DH>The Franco-Chinese menu will be much like that of the
Laguna Beach original.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA PETTERA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five More Feet: Michael Kang is a man who likes a mystery. His
Franco-Chinese restaurant in Laguna Beach (a hot spot there since
1985) is named 5'--that is, Five Feet. He'll give you all sorts of
meanings for the name, but he won't tell which is the real one. Same
with the new Five Feet that opened Wednesday in Le Colonial's old
digs on Beverly Boulevard in West Hollywood. Five Feet could mean
that the restaurant sits 5 feet above sea level, or it could mean it
has three investors, one of whom is one-legged. (That's Kang's
favorite story so far. Patrons keep coming up with more explanations
as the years go by.) Just don't ask whether Kang is 5 feet tall.
"Don't sell me short!" he'll retort. Regardless, the new West
Hollywood Five Feet will serve the same sort of food as its Laguna
Beach original.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, the staples will be the same," says Kang, "the Five
Feet classics." Kang will be in the kitchen himself at least three
days a week working alongside executive chef Eric Nguyen, who will
interpret Kang's ideas in his own ways. "But the essence will be the
same," says Kang.</LD>
<TE>   Dinner starters (or Flatteries, as the menu calls them) include
sugar cane lollipops of shrimp ($10), lotus-wrapped baby spareribs
($12) and a carpaccio of smoked ostrich with Asian pear slaw ($10).
Each entree has its own kitschy name, such as the Drunken King
(sake-cured King salmon broiled with miso-black bean butter; $26),
the French Connection (loup de mer in an orange-fennel broth; $27) or
Luau Lamb, (a Kona-coffee-glazed lamb rack; $34). Five Feet opens for
dinner at 5 p.m. nightly, with a bar and lounge that's open from 5:15
p.m. The name of the bar is, of course, 5:15.</TE>
<TE>   * Five Feet, 8783 Beverly Blvd., West Hollywood; (310) 289-0660.</TE>
<TE>   A Twist at Hollywood &amp; Highland? Twist restaurant opened recently
(Dec. 26) in the newly refinished Renaissance Hollywood Hotel that
adjoins the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping complex. The hotel (owned
by Marriott Corp.) has transformed itself into a mid-20th century
modernist creation; think 1960s done in a very stark, updated way
with Asian touches. Twist sits on the second level of the hotel,
serving breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. It's so named because, as
general manager Kathy Marienski puts it, "It's a twist on what you
would usually expect." During the day, the tables are dressed in
white linens. At night they change to black, set with silver
chopsticks and crystal stemware.</TE>
<TE>   The food, served in small portions (so you "don't have to steal,"
as the menu confusingly says), comes out on oversized white plates.
Each diner gets a glass leaf called a share plate. The food is either
set in the middle of the table for all to take from or passed around
the table from diner to diner. The concept is similar to Asia de
Cuba's, but Twist is trying to make it more friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Chef Scott Higa sends out lobster crab cakes ($14), lemongrass
chicken skewers ($10) and a pork back rib tower in a Thai barbecue
marinade ($10) for starters at night. Dinner entrees run from
pancetta-wrapped prawns ($22) to seared tenderloin with foie gras
($32) to Asian osso buco ($26). A sushi chef sets up a sushi bar
Tuesday through Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the hotel off of Highland Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   * Twist, Renaissance Hollywood Hotel, 1755 N. Highland Ave.,
Hollywood; (323) 491-1000.</TE>
<TE>   Spago Goes Hawaiian: The Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group added a
fifth Spago to its roster last month (the others are in Beverly
Hills, Las Vegas, Chicago and Palo Alto). It's located inside the
Four Seasons Resort Maui. Wolfgang Puck and his corporate chef, Lee
Hefter (you know him as the chef at Spago Beverly Hills), designed
the menu to be a fusion of Hawaiian and Californian cuisines. The
Maui operation's executive chef, Jason Seibert, met Hefter while the
two worked at Barbara Tropp's China Moon Cafe in San Francisco.

<TE>   The Beverly Hills Diner: Fred Eric, owner of the restaurant Vida
and the diner Fred 62, both in Los Feliz, has plans to invade Beverly
Hills. He'll open Fred 62--An Airstream Diner if his licensing deal
with Airstream trailers goes through. The look will be sleek and
silver and even more diner-like than the original Fred 62. Eric will
also put a doughnut stand in this new "Fred 62 with a Gucci flair,"
as he calls it. He's hoping to open in April at Camden Drive and
Santa Monica Boulevard, where Azia operated.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he's got savage plans for Valentine's Day at
Vida. The theme is "If you were stuck on a desert island ..." Expect
a Brazilian fish soup (yes, he knows Brazil isn't an island) with
coconut, filled lettuce cups that you feed to your dining companion,
big sticks of grilled lobster and vegetables and prime rib. (Exact
menu and prices have yet to be set.) "The main thing is that people
will have a little adventure," says Eric. In the bar afterward (10
p.m. and later) singles can celebrate being alone tiki-style.</TE>

<TE>   Patina's Best Table: Joachim Splichal has finally opened his
Chef's Table at Patina. He'd been planning it for the kitchen since
he remodeled last year, but it wasn't finished until now. Six people
can sit in a banquette in a corner of the kitchen with a glass
partition dividing them from the hot stoves and state-of-the-art
warming counters and refrigerated wall cabinets. Chef Walter Manzke
will prepare an eight-course dinner menu that can be paired with
wines by sommelier Chris Meeske.</TE>
<TE>   The menu, which changes daily, is based on what Manzke finds at
the farmers market (perhaps along with a cheese course). Dining there
any night Tuesday through Sunday (the restaurant is closed Mondays)
will cost a party of six people $1,200 for eight courses of food with
eight wines (this includes tax and tip). If you want to order wine as
you go, the tab is $600 plus the cost of wines, tax and tip. At lunch
on Fridays, there's a five-course menu for six people ($450 plus tax
and tip). To reserve a space at the Chef's Table, call Sheila in the
corporate office at (323) 960-1762.</TE>
<TE>   Manzke is also preparing a black truffle dinner on Feb. 5, 6 and 7
at 6 p.m. The prized French fungus will be incorporated into a
mille-feuille of salmon, squab with wilted spinach, veal tenderloin
with Madeira jus, a Valrhona chocolate cake with ice cream and more.
Five courses are $89 plus tax and tip; ordering six courses will push
it up to $99 plus tax and tip.</TE>

<HD>Kubrick's 'Lolita': An Acting Showcase</HD>
<DH>The director's 1962 film highlights the talents of James
Mason, Shelley Winters and Peter Sellers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Cinematheque's "Grand Master: The Films of Stanley
Kubrick" continues at the Egyptian tonight at 7:30 with the
presentation of "Lolita" (1962). When Kubrick brought the
controversial Vladimir Nabokov novel to the screen, he cast
15-year-old newcomer Sue Lyon in the title role without specifying
her age, which in the book was only 12. Most critics said that Lyon
looked closer to 17, thus undercutting the impact of the exquisite
torture Nabokov's middle-aged Humbert Humbert endured in his fixation
on what the novelist described famously as a "nymphet."</LD>
<LD>   Kubrick did not make things easier for himself by shooting much of
the film in England, even though it is in part a road movie. He thus
denied himself access to roadside Americana--always a ripe target for
satire--which could have counterpointed Nabokov's consideration of
the deadly, darkly humorous absurdities of unrequited passion,
heightened by puritanical American mores.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, "Lolita" is worth a look on the big screen, just as it
was when first released, thanks to its sophisticated sensibility and
James Mason's heroic portrayal of Humbert and the impressive work of
Shelley Winters and Peter Sellers. Lyon is pretty good as the "older"
revised Lolita, but at 153 minutes, the film is too long.</LD>
<TE>   Mason's Humbert is a professor of French literature who's a
visiting lecturer at a New England college. He checks out a room for
rent in the large, tasteless home of Charlotte Haze (Winters), a
vulgar, man-hungry widow with literary pretensions.</TE>
<TE>   In the film's signature shot, Humbert sees Lolita lounging in a
two-piece bathing suit in the backyard, and Charlotte asks
innocently, "What was the deciding factor?" when he abruptly agrees
to take the room--and thus commences his tormented odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   "Lolita" reminds us what a remarkable actor Mason was in his range
and insight into the characters he played, and Winters is hilarious
yet oddly touching as the impossibly shrill, foolish and possessive
Charlotte, as dense as Humbert is perceptive. Early on, Sellers'
Quilty, an eccentric writer, also a guest of the college, becomes
Humbert's determined nemesis for reasons of his own. Quilty's various
disguises allow Sellers to show off his wondrous way with accents.
(323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   "Paths of Glory" (1957) and "Full Metal Jacket" (1987), Kubrick's
two antiwar classics, screen Friday at 7:30 p.m., and Jan Harlan's
documentary "Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures" screens Saturday at
5 p.m., with "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) screening at 8:30 p.m. (323)
466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just as the amusing but wry and substantial "The Fluffer," about
the perils of gay porn stardom, has gone into release, its
co-director Richard Glatzer's "Grief" (1993) screens Wednesday as an
Outfest presentation. Glatzer and cast members are scheduled to
attend the 7:30 p.m. screening at the Village at Ed Gould Plaza, 1125
N. McCadden Place, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Grief" may be an unlikely title for a comedy, but a large part of
its appeal lies in its willingness to take its people seriously amid
much laughter. In a nifty feature debut, writer-director Glatzer
makes hilarious use of his experiences as a producer of "Divorce
Court" as he takes us into the crazed world of the writers for a
lurid daytime courtroom TV show. The staff runs the gamut of sexual
orientation from gay to uncertain to straight to another of
indeterminate gender.</TE>
<TE>   Glatzer picks a particularly tumultuous week in the production
office of "The Love Judge," headquartered in the Art Deco Montecito
apartment building on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood. Central among six
key characters is Craig Chester's Mark, a pleasant, preppie-looking
story editor considered to be among the most gifted of the series'
writers and one of the operation's more mature presences.</TE>
<TE>   However, he's facing the first anniversary of the death of his
lover from AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Jo (Jackie Beat), the show's producer, announces that
she's leaving to get married. This doesn't mean she still isn't
thrown into a tizzy every time she discovers evidence that her
office's couch has been used for some off-duty hanky-panky. Other key
figures are Jo's man-crazy assistant Leslie (Illeana Douglas), who's
eager to break into writing; Bill (Alexis Arquette), who's just
broken up with his girlfriend; the muscular Jeremy (Carlton Wilborn),
as wise as he is sexy; and the ambitious Paula (Lucy Gutteridge).</TE>
<TE>   Drawing upon personal as well as professional experiences--like
Mark, he has also lost a lover--the insightful Glatzer is a filmmaker
of humor and compassion. He also brings a sure sense of structure and
makes the most of an opportunity to display a gift for sharp, witty
dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Grief" takes place virtually entirely within "The Love Judge"
offices, yet it is always cinematic, never stagy. Whenever "Grief"
threatens to get too emotional, Glatzer deftly cuts to glimpses of
outrageous "Love Judge" episodes. Made on an ultra-low budget, the
sharply acted "Grief " may be outlandish, but its characters prove
endearing. (323) 960-9200.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's 12th annual "Celebration of Iranian Cinema" continues
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater with
the Los Angeles premiere of yet another major work, Maziar Miri's
compelling and boldly critical "Unfinished Song." A young Tehran
musicologist Farhad (Ali-Reza Anoushfar), travels to his rural
birthplace, the province of Khorasan, to record traditional folk
songs to preserve them for posterity. Such songs have traditionally
been the province of women, but since the Islamic Revolution women
have been prohibited from singing in public (the definition of a
public performance can extend even to the most private wedding
celebrations). So in just one generation an entire region's musical
heritage is in danger of being eradicated in the name of
fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfinished Song" turns into an increasingly suspenseful detective
story as Farhad attempts to track down the one woman rumored to know
all the songs that are on the verge of being lost forever. The
compelling "Unfinished Song" builds to a finish that involves a
bitterly ironic twist. With this superb film, which is relieved with
bleak humor, Maziar Miri's name joins an ever-lengthening list of
filmmakers who are making the Iranian cinema one of the most
provocative in the world. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<HD>Making Films Just Like an Insider</HD>
<DH>Tsai Ming-Liang, who grew up in Malaysia, has a knack for
capturing life in Taiwan. He makes his U.S. debut with 'What Time Is
It There?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outsiders often illuminate the worlds they observe in ways that elude
insiders. It's a perspective that can serve filmmakers well, and that
has proved true for Tsai Ming-Liang, who over the past decade has
emerged as one of Taiwan's most gifted directors.</LD>
<LD>   "I grew up in Malaysia, and I went to Taiwan for college,"
explained Tsai, whose first film to receive regular release in the
U.S., "What Time Is It There?," opens Friday at the Nuart and the
University 6 in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   "At the time I did not imagine myself becoming a filmmaker," Tsai
said. "I just liked movies. So, when I went to college, I selected
what was closest to film, Western theater. After I got out of
college, I started writing for a living, writing for TV. I wrote a
lot of kids' programs, a lot of weird things. And I also worked in
theater for a long time.</LD>
<TE>   "After writing for a couple of years, someone approached me about
directing a TV movie called 'All Corners of the World.' That was my
first film. It was highly acclaimed by the film and TV industry in
Taiwan. It won a lot of awards."</TE>
<TE>   Tsai's next work for television, "The Kid," marked the beginning
of his ongoing collaboration with Lee Kang-Sheng, whose boyish looks
belie his impressive acting range.</TE>
<TE>   When Tsai got his chance to direct features he was determined not
to make the kind of commercial fare he had worked on during his TV
apprenticeship and instead drew inspiration from his experiences
working in the theater and in recalling the short stories he wrote
for himself in his childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "All my movies are about me and what I feel about the world around
me," said Tsai, a slender, low-key man with a sure sense of humor,
who sat down for an interview in his West Hollywood hotel room last
year when he was passing through Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai has a fair command of English but relies on an interpreter in
discussing his work, showing the same concern for preciseness that he
brings to the films that have won him international renown.</TE>
<TE>   He solidified his reputation with a trilogy of films--"Rebels of
the Neon Gods," "Vive l'Amour" and "The River"--that revealed that
life in sleek, modern Taipei can be as lonely and isolating as in any
Western metropolis. With "The Hole" (1998) Tsai added a darkly
bizarre and surreal twist to his abiding theme.</TE>
<TE>   As austere as "What Time Is It There?" is, it is relieved by a
bleak absurdist humor and holds up a ray of hope.</TE>
<TE>   The demanding yet delightful film is set in motion when a lovely
young woman, Shiang-Chyi (Chen Shiang-Chyi), set to leave for Paris
the next day, buys a watch from a young street vendor, Hsiao Kang
(Lee). Hsiao Kang yearns to see her again but in the meantime she is
coping with being on her own in Paris and the vendor's mother is
becoming obsessed with communicating with the spirit of her recently
deceased husband.</TE>
<TE>   The film is not as stark as Tsai's masterpiece "The River," in
which its young hero (again Lee), an older woman and an older
man--parents and grown son--live together in a small Taipei
apartment. This is surprising because at the film's outset their
lives are separate. (Happily, "The River," which like all of Tsai's
previous films, has been seen only at festivals and in institutional
settings, now has an American distributor.)</TE>
<TE>   Tsai agrees that not coming to Taiwan until age 20 gave him an
outsider's perspective. A screenwriter friend of Tsai's was upset to
discover that "All the World's Children," while outstanding, had
actually been made by someone who had not spent his entire life in
the country, especially because Tsai dared to be critical.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about two kids--a sister, a high school student, and her
younger brother, who's in elementary school," he said. "It's set in
Taipei, which is rapidly changing. They see a lot of the ways of the
adults around them, making money any way they can, and these kids are
coping with lots of temptations and confusion."</TE>
<TE>   After 20 years, half his lifetime, Tsai no longer thinks of
himself as an outsider but says that returning home to Malaysia for
occasional visits has helped him keep his perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai considers himself very fortunate that he arrived in Taiwan
when he did.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past 20 years Taipei, and Taiwan itself, have gone through
a lot of changes, both economically and politically," Tsai says.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years ago there was still martial law. Also, economic
developments have basically changed Taiwan from a Third World country
to what it is now, and I've been there to observe it all."</TE>
<TE>   Tsai says the combination of the changing economy and growing
political freedom coincided with his realization that the Taiwanese
cinema prior to the emergence of master Taiwanese filmmaker Hsiou
Hsao-Hsien had been very commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai says it's a plus that Taiwan has had little serious cinema in
its history, allowing it to flower unburdened by the past. Taiwanese
cinema (and that of Iran) has been some of the most challenging
national cinema to emerge in the past decade--at a time when the
Southeast Asian commercial motion picture industry has been losing
ground to Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai's films, however, are not shown in China, because of Taiwan's
uneasy relations with the mainland. Tsai also reports that his and
Hsiou's films do poorly at home because they are not properly
distributed. As for Taiwanese audiences who do see his films, he
said, "Some moviegoers and some critics really love them and others
absolutely hate them, but I think the situation will improve. Maybe
my films are too far ahead of the average audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Their inspiration usually comes from one very strong incident in
my life. When the accumulated emotions come back to me, some time
after the incident took place, some emotions remain, and I just feel
compelled to make a film out of them."</TE>
<TE>   For example, in "The River," Lee plays a young man, hoping to pick
up some pocket money, who jumps into a polluted river for a scene
being staged by a film director; he subsequently develops a paralysis
in his neck that determines the course of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Its inspiration came from Tsai's memory of a hard-to-treat pain in
his neck combined with a scene edited out of "All the Corners of the
World" in which he had one boy push into a river by another boy, who
as a result of the polluted water became ill for several days.</TE>
<TE>   Before Tsai went to college, his favorite films were from
Hollywood because they were the only ones he was able to see while
growing up. He loved Tarzan movies, James Bond, "King Kong" and "some
movie about tarantula spiders."</TE>
<TE>   In college and afterward he was able to discover and admire the
work of the great Japanese filmmakers and also the films of Francois
Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, R.W. Fassbinder and Luchino Visconti.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with "What Time Is It There?," Tsai Ming-Liang has been able
to move beyond Taipei to Paris, where he pays homage to Truffaut. The
character Hsaio Kang looks at a video of "The 400 Blows" and has a
chance meeting in a cemetery with its star, Jean-Pierre Leaud.</TE>
<TE>   It's a brief, charming moment, yet anyone who's ever seen a Tsai
film would suspect that among French filmmakers it would be the
spiritual Robert Bresson who has had the greatest impact upon him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the one," Tsai admits, laughing. "That's the one I think
is the big influence."</TE>

<HD>Little Insight on 'Terror Network'</HD>

<LD>When the doomed epic "Heaven's Gate" was unleashed upon an
unsuspecting moviegoing public in 1980, one particularly crusty
critic compared the experience of watching it to "a forced four-hour
tour of your own living room."</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's airing of a "Frontline" documentary on the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks packs a similar appeal. "Inside the Terror Network"
(9 p.m., KCET) errs not in its execution but in the excruciating
familiarity of most of the subject matter. Anyone who hasn't been
living in an Afghan cave for the last four months has been immersed
in the minutiae of the people and places involved, so the
considerable burden falls on any new working of the subject to bring
something fresh to the table. This doesn't pull that off.</LD>
<LD>   The one-hour program focuses on three of the principals in the
attack: Mohammed Atta, Marwan al Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah. Their shared
apartment in Hamburg, Germany, serves as the documentary's ground
zero, where their increasingly radicalized beliefs crystallized into
carrying out the unthinkable.</LD>
<TE>   And what trip into the mind of a mass murderer would be complete
without a visit to colleagues and mystified family members, who mouth
all-too-familiar sentiments about the subject's quiet charm and
gentle nature. Until they began changing, that is.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, everything changed.</TE>

<HD>How X Factors in the Equation</HD>
<DH>A new roller coaster at Six Flags suspends riders beside
the track. Fast? Yes. But it's over fast, too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT NILES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hurtling face-first, spread-eagled, 200 feet toward the ground below,
I wondered just why it was I'd been looking forward to Jan. 12.
Wasn't there something else I could have been doing right now
instead?</LD>
<LD>   Like, well, anything else?</LD>
<LD>   Instead, several thousand of us had queued up for the first day of
Six Flags Magic Mountain's new roller coaster, X. You can't miss it
on the drive into the park--its twisted nest of purple metal, held up
by a small forest of yellow support towers, is the first thing you
see as you pull in from Magic Mountain Boulevard. And that mess of
metal remained the focus of attention for several families and groups
of friends making the walk from the parking lot to the front gate an
hour before the park opened last Saturday: "Look, that's the new
ride."</LD>
<TE>   "Do you think it's scary?"</TE>
<TE>   As the chatter continued, a riderless train appeared on X's track.
The racket of the coaster making its way up the lift added to the din
on the walkway. For nearly a minute, the train crawled to the top of
the lift. By the time it reached the top, everyone on the walkway had
noticed it. The train crested, the lift fell silent, and instantly,
so did the crowd. All stared quietly as it plunged 90 degrees, 200
feet to the earth. Then, at once, reaction:: "Oh ... my ... God."</TE>
<TE>   X is a first-of-its-kind "4D" model from noted coaster designer
Arrow Dynamics. Riders on X don't sit on top of the coaster track, or
suspended underneath it, as they would on traditional coasters.
Instead, they ride on the side of the track, in seats that rotate 360
degrees during the ride. And, if that weren't enough, there's that
face-first initial drop.</TE>
<TE>   OK, I'll fess up. The first time I heard about this design, I
envisioned spinning in a clothes dryer that had been dropped on to a
track. Fortunately, X isn't nearly so upsetting.</TE>
<TE>   But it's hard to know what to expect from X as you approach the
ride. Its queue is as plain and boring as all the others at Six Flags
parks. Let Disney or Universal worry about storytelling; riding a
coaster at a Six Flags park is about the visceral experience. Even
with few expectations, I was disappointed--waiting is not so bad if
you can at least watch the show. The enormous lift hill and loading
platform obscure almost all of the track from view. The next right
over, the Viper is visible, but X remains a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   But then, half the fun of a roller coaster is the wait--having
time to get nervous. That's what Sitel Bhaget was doing with a little
help from her friends. They fingered the Montebello teen as the
chicken of their group after she backed out of a bungee-jumping trip
and expressed second thoughts about riding X. As her friends laughed,
others in line found people in their own groups to harass, passing
time during a wait that had grown to over an hour--just 40 minutes
after X opened. And it's not close to the summer crowd crush.</TE>
<TE>   X's name is meant to evoke stereotypical teen obsession with all
things "extreme." But the name also works for the mathematically
inclined, as the classic expression of a variable. It's appropriate
for a ride that feels like an ever-changing highlight reel of several
other coasters. X's rotating seats allow the ride to switch from a
backward coaster to a traditional front-facing one without jarring
stops or momentum changes.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the panic of the initial plunge yielded quickly to
exhilaration, as X swept me through its flips, loops and turns, with
seat rotations smartly coordinated to each twist of the track. And
then, it was over. That seemingly endless, 52-second trip up the lift
yielded a ride of just over 45 seconds. Too little time for so much.
Only on the turnaround did I get a chance to breathe and anticipate
the next drop and twist.</TE>
<TE>   It's not enough. X delivers plenty of action, but beyond its
initial drop, the ride is all frenzy. Each element is over and you're
onto the next before you get a chance to absorb what's happened.</TE>
<TE>   Almost no riders left with green faces or unsure steps. And not
one of more than two dozen asked at the exit had anything negative to
say. Sure, the ride could have used a few more breathers, to set up
and sustain the drama. But X's terrific first plunge and technical
innovations have already marked it as a welcome addition to Southern
California's coaster collection.</TE>

<HD>Another Helping of 'Pie,' With Treats on the Side</HD>
<DH>Extras include the 10 top moments in the sequel and the
original, as well as a fake public service ad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The DVD industry is always trying to think up new and creative extras
to augment its digital discs. In the case of Universal's DVD of its
raucous, ribald comedy "American Pie 2" ($27), the studio conducted a
"Pie Poll" on MSN.com to find out the fans' 10 favorite moments from
"American Pie 2" and the 1999 original, "American Pie," and has
included them.</LD>
<LD>   Seann William Scott, who steals "American Pie 2" as the womanizing
pea-brain Stifler, provides the introduction to the 10 scenes. The
No. 1 favorite is the scene from "American Pie 2" in which Jim (Jason
Biggs) and Stifler kiss. Among the other fan favorites are the scenes
in which Stifler thinks a girl is pouring beer over his face, Jim
accidentally glues his hand and a VHS cassette to an area below his
waist and Jim has a grand time with an apple pie.</LD>
<TE>   The fun disc--which is featured in rated and unrated formats, with
each version also available in wide-screen and pan-and-scan--includes
a naughty fake public-service announcement from Biggs;
behind-the-scenes video footage shot by the stars; a decent
documentary that features interviews with director James B. Rogers,
writer Adam Herz and stars Biggs, Mena Suvari, Thomas Ian Nicholas,
Eddie Kaye Thomas and Shannon Elizabeth; several R-rated outtakes and
deleted scenes; and casting tapes from the original "American Pie"
auditions, including Biggs, Thomas and a heavily made up, almost
unrecognizable Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   Also included is a music video from 3 Doors Down, choice lines
from both films, talent files and production notes.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the disc are four audio commentaries, including one
with Rogers and one with Biggs, Suvari and Nicholas. If you listen to
the commentary featuring Biggs, you'll find out what article of
clothing he wears in the film that he refers to as "manties."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friends Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming star in, wrote and
directed the uneven comedy-drama "The Anniversary Party." The
exploration of a troubled marriage during a 24-hour period, "The
Anniversary Party" was shot in just 19 days using digital video
cameras. Leigh and Cumming wrote other roles for their friends. And
what talented friends--Kevin Kline, his real-life wife, Phoebe Cates;
Gwyneth Paltrow; John C. Reilly; Jane Adams; Parker Posey; and
Jennifer Beals. Otis, who plays Leigh and Cumming's adorable pooch,
is Leigh's own dog. Though the performances are all first-rate, the
characters they play are generally self-absorbed and unlikable.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (New Line, $25) includes a wide-screen version of the film
that was shot by noted cinematographer John Bailey, talent files, a
trailer and a Sundance Channel documentary, "Anatomy of a Scene."
Leigh, who is quiet, and Cumming, who is much more demonstrative,
provide the insightful commentary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The long-running WB-now-UPN series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
makes its DVD debut this week. The entertaining "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer Season One" (Fox, $40) features all 12 episodes from the first
season of Joss Whedon's clever, funny and action-packed series, which
stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as the reluctant teenage slayer of
vampires. The three-disc set features vintage interviews with Whedon
and David Boreanaz, who played Angel, Buffy's love interest, before
getting his own series; the original pilot script; photo galleries;
talent files, the original trailer for the series and amusing
commentary from Whedon on the first two episodes of the series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New on digital disc from Facets is the lovely "Melies the
Magician" ($30). The DVD features 15 of the pioneer French filmmaker
Georges Melies' delightful, inventive films, including his best
known, "A Trip to the Moon" from 1902. "Melies the Magician" was
produced by the European TV channel ARTE in collaboration with
Melies' granddaughter, Madeline Maithete-Melies, and the Cinematheque
Melies. The DVD also features a documentary, "The Magic of Melies."</TE>
<TE>   "E-O-11."</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the Rat Pack will be in heaven with the sparkling new DVDs
of the Pack's best-loved films: 1960's "Ocean's 11" and 1964's "Robin
and the Seven Hoods" (Warner, $20 each).</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, Sammy
Davis Jr. and Angie Dickinson headline the slick crime-caper comedy
"Ocean's 11" (the George Clooney-Brad Pitt remake is currently
packing 'em in), about former Army buddies who attempt to rob five
Las Vegas casinos on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The disc includes a beautiful wide-screen transfer of the film; an
interactive map of the Las Vegas casinos featured in the movie;
interviews with former showgirls, dealers and cocktail waitresses who
knew the Pack; two theatrical trailers and a scene from "The Tonight
Show" featuring Ol' Blue Eyes as guest host and Dickinson as his
guest. Frank Sinatra Jr., who refers to his father as "Sinatra," and
Dickinson supply the informative, entertaining commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Sinatra Jr. also provides the commentary for "Robin and the Seven
Hoods," a fun-filled musical based on the "Robin Hood" legend.
Sinatra Jr. points out that the film should have been fun for the
cast but production was shut down twice.</TE>
<TE>   Filming stopped for two weeks after John F. Kennedy was
assassinated and again when Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped at 19 while
performing in Lake Tahoe. (He was released unharmed three days
later.)</TE>
<TE>   The DVD package also includes a nice, wide-screen transfer of the
movie, the trailer and a vintage featurette, "What They Did to Robin
Hood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disney's 1982 sci-fi flick, "Tron," one of the first films based
almost entirely around computer-generated effects, has been restored
and remastered for a two-set DVD-- "Tron 20th Anniversary Collector's
Edition" ($30). Jeff Bridges, Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan star
in this thriller, which is set in a universe where computer games are
real.</TE>
<TE>   Although the special effects and animation still are eye-popping,
dramatically "Tron" is a bit of a snooze.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a comprehensive documentary, "The
Making of Tron," that includes interviews with writer-director Steve
Lisberger, visual effects supervisors Richard Taylor, visual effects
supervisor and associate producer Harrison Ellenshaw, producer Donald
Kushner and cast members.</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of the discs include deleted scenes with introductions
by Lisberger and Ellenshaw, a production photo gallery,
storyboard-to-film comparison, still frame galleries, pre-production
animation tests, original soundtrack music of the cycle race, the end
titles that were cut from the film, computer animation design and
demo reels, publicity materials and a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Lisberger, Kushner, Ellenshaw and Taylor provide the interesting
commentary, although Ellenshaw and Taylor get a bit too technical for
general audiences when describing how the computer animation was
done.</TE>

<HD>Fred Eaglesmith Blends Banter With Some Wistful Narratives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marc Weingarten</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Eaglesmith is a folkie who doesn't buy into the usual rosy myths
about the American heartland--his darkly comic vision is more Walker
Evans than Ansel Adams.</LD>
<LD>   A stocky, balding firebrand with a weathered, craggy voice,
Eaglesmith uses his terse narratives about crumbling relationships
and a vanishing rural idyll like blunt instruments, with all the
residual sentiment stripped away.</LD>
<LD>   Making a rare solo appearance at Genghis Cohen on Tuesday, the
Canadian entertained an intimate clutch of loyalists with a short set
that alternated between humorous tall tales and stark tragedies.</LD>
<TE>   Eaglesmith writes with small brush strokes. His songs home in on
telling details and offhanded moments that can conjure entire worlds.
For the most part, his material on Tuesday was wistful and suffused
with an odd optimism.</TE>
<TE>   He sang about a restless owner of a roadside hot-dog stand who
longs to learn how to make Texas barbecue, an out-of-business gas
station where ghosts linger, a May-December romance that stubbornly
refuses to fade.</TE>
<TE>   Eaglesmith's fatalist streak turned up in his songs about broken
relationships and in his between-song banter, which sounded like
finely calibrated comedy routines.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tricky balancing act, this whipsawing from pathos to broad
yuks, but Eaglesmith negotiated it well, even when he busted a guitar
string and had borrow an instrument to close out his set.</TE>

<KH>Sundance Festival</KH>
<HD>Experiment in Progress</HD>
<DH>Twenty years later, the films are getting better, not more
commercial, says Redford, citing evolving technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PARK CITY, Utah--The question is put to Robert Redford: Are the
movies being screened at the Sundance Film Festival becoming too
commercial? It is a complaint heard often around this snow-dusted
resort town that annually plays host to America's largest celebration
of independent filmmaking.</LD>
<LD>   Sundance, go the arguments, is getting too big and too market
driven; the films are too glossy and increasingly feature big-name
stars; Miramax and Fox Searchlight and now even HBO are using the
festival as a launching pad for their theatrical releases and even
cable TV movies.</LD>
<LD>   Redford, seated in a rustic banquet room on the second floor of
his upscale Main Street restaurant, Zoom, doesn't miss a beat: "No."</LD>
<TE>   He then points to some of this year's films as examples of
experimental filmmaking that are far from the mainstream of
Hollywood, films such as Gus Van Sant's "Gerry," or Moises Kaufman's
"The Laramie Project," which opened the festival, or John Malkovich's
"The Dancer Upstairs."</TE>
<TE>   "Gerry" is an experimental film about a pair of friends who become
lost in the New Mexico desert; "Laramie" concerns a theater troupe
that descends upon the Wyoming college town after Matthew Shepard's
murder; and "Dancer" involves a South American detective on the trail
of a guerrilla leader.</TE>
<TE>   "You can hardly say those are too commercial," Redford said.
"They're all risk-takers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much what we do because we're nonprofit. We are not
forced to program for commercial purposes. Commerciality is not a
factor in our programming. It's diversity, uniqueness of the vision
and the independent voice and the talent of the film.</TE>
<TE>   "What has happened is that, one, more filmmakers are getting
funded before they come here. In the early years, nobody had any
money. They just managed somehow to make their films and brought them
here to show so that somebody could exhibit them.</TE>
<TE>   "Secondly, the quality of independent films has naturally evolved
to a much higher grade," he added. "You've got young film students
now that get into film with video cameras and recorders, now digital
[cameras] and computers that are far advanced at an earlier age."</TE>
<TE>   Redford said the more accomplished a film looks when it arrives at
Sundance, the more people think it looks like a Hollywood film.</TE>
<TE>   "So, people say, 'Oh, I see, you're going commercial.' No, it's
just getting better. Also, you have to be honest, a lot of filmmakers
would love to be in Hollywood. But you talk to a Sherman Alexie
('Smoke Signals') and say, 'Sherman, how was it when you went to
Hollywood?' and he'll tell you why somebody should not be taken
there."</TE>
<TE>   It has been two decades since Redford founded Sundance. At the
time, he would have been happy to see it last 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started this thing, it was to be a side thing to the rest
of my career," he said. "I just decided to stop my career for a
year.... Then it grew."</TE>
<TE>   Redford said at the time Sundance was a new idea, but like other
new ideas he had researched, he knew that it would likely just run
its course or get co-opted by a corporate hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I just assumed that if we succeeded, and I didn't know if we
would, if we were to survive, you've got to be good for 10 years.
What happened, it kind of grew itself and we realized, 'Oh, it's
because we're [keeping up] with the change' in the independent film
world."</TE>
<TE>   Documentaries</TE>
<TE>   Grow in Popularity</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, some of the better films shown at Sundance have
been documentaries. As a result, Redford this week used the
festival's massive media presence to announce that beginning later
this year, the Sundance Channel, of which he is a founder and
creative director, would launch a network devoted exclusively to
documentary films.</TE>
<TE>   The new network will be owned and operated by Sundance Channel,
and will show independent nonfiction films, shorts and features, from
the U.S. and abroad. The Sundance Channel has about 14 million
subscribers and is available in 55 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Redford says that if documentaries have been stigmatized by
viewers, it is because for too long they were equated with what's on
PBS, "which is, 'See it because it's good for you.' It has this kind
of medicinal ring to it like you're supposed to see it because it was
good for you. So, of course, they don't want to. If they don't
classify it as entertainment, they classify it as a classroom
activity."</TE>
<TE>   Redford said he has made documentaries, narrated several and
produced several in the 1970s. Back then, they usually amounted to
talking heads, but documentaries have improved in recent years so
that they often rival feature films for entertainment value. And the
issues got edgier and riskier.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't just my own taste," Redford said. "I'm now hearing more
from audiences who come out of our festival saying 'You know what, I
like the documentaries almost more than the main features.'"</TE>
<TE>   Creating Support</TE>
<TE>   for Nonfiction Films</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma for documentary filmmakers is that very few of their
works are ever released theatrically. A festival spokesman estimated
that of 500 American documentaries made each year, only 10 to 20
reach local theaters.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time the Sundance documentary channel is being formed,
Redford said the Sundance Institute is also establishing a
documentary fund to help finance the films. The fund was made
possible through financier George Soros with a $4.6-million grant
from the New York-based Open Society Institute. The grants had
previously been funded by the Soros Documentary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Under Sundance, filmmakers can apply for up to $50,000 in grants
to complete a documentary in progress or up to $15,000 as seed money
for a new one.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he noted, not only will there be seed money for the
documentaries, but also a means of promoting and exhibiting them.</TE>
<TE>   "And I guess we probably won't be happy until we get our Sundance
cinemas started and we'll be able to exhibit them."</TE>
<TE>   Redford said the plan to invest in theaters is running a little
behind. Acknowledging that theater chains are declaring bankruptcy
these days, he smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, the worst of times is our best of times. Everything we
started in the past has been at the worst possible time."</TE>

<TE>   CAFE TU TU TANGO: This cavernous, high-octane space is filled with
art created on the premises by working artists. The eclectic,
all-appetizer menu includes Cajun chicken egg rolls, Dijon chicken
skewers and tuna sashimi. Live entertainment also surfaces
("spontaneously," to quote management). Cafe Tu Tu Tango, the Block
at Orange. (714) 769-2222. Sundays-Wednesdays, 11 a.m.-midnight;
Thursdays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-1 a.m. $</TE>

<TE>   CAFE ZOOLU: Cafe Zoolu is Laguna Beach all the way, from the funky
quasi-Polynesian interiors to owner-chef Michael Leech's cooking. Try
the swordfish. This place is casual and hip without being trendy.
Cafe Zoolu, 860 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (949) 494-6825. Open for
dinner Tuesdays-Sundays, 5 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CANYON LODGE: Canyon Lodge overlooks a rustic golf course
landscaped with chaparral, and the restaurant serves a menu of
comfort foods nearly as American in spirit. They serve a mean cream
of tomato soup and sumptuous desserts. Best dishes: flatiron steak,
smoked prime rib and an amazing Mandarin chicken salad. Canyon Lodge,
31106 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (949) 499-2663. Lunch

selection of daily seafood specials.  Capriccio Italiano Ristorante.
25380 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. (949) 855-6866. Lunch
Mondays-Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; dinner daily, starting at
4:30. $$</TE>

<TE>   CEDAR CREEK INN: The Cedar Creek Inn in Brea may be less homey
than the others, but it's an appropriate setting for a serious,
fine-dining approach to American food. There are classics like German
pot roast and prime rib, mostly successful innovations like chicken
breast stuffed with pecans and Brie--and, of course, devastating
chocolate desserts. Cedar Creek Inn, 20 Pointe Drive, Brea. (714)
255-5600. Lunch and dinner daily, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Also in Laguna
Beach, San Juan Capistrano. $$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHIMAYO AT THE BEACH: Chimayo at the Beach has a hot concept, a
killer location opposite Huntington Beach Pier and stunning design.
The menu is half Southwestern (star restaurateur David Wilhelm's
forte), half seafood. Don't miss the rare ahi rolls with avocado or
the slushy mango margarita. Chimayo at the Beach, 315 Pacific Coast
Highway, Huntington Beach. (714) 374-7273. Sundays-Thursdays, 11:30
a.m.-10 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 11:30 a.m.-11 p.m. $$$</TE>

<TE>   CHINA PALACE: China Palace has kept pace with changing tastes in
its 20-year existence, while dozens, even hundreds of nearby
restaurants have come and gone. This gaudy, tropical-themed place has
a sushi bar and a Chinese kitchen that turns out dishes such as veal
scaloppine with basil, fried soft-shell crab, Pekin duck and terrific
fried calamari. China Palace, 2800 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach.

<TE>   CHIN CHIN: A longtime Los Angeles staple, this Orange County
outpost specializes in Chinese snacks and dumplings, as well as
noodles, salads, barbecued meats and stir-fried dishes. The best
items include barbecued pork, Sichuan dumplings and stir-fried
eggplant. If you want real dim sum, though, you still have to go to
Monterey Park. Chin Chin, 27441 Crown Valley Parkway, Mission Viejo.
(949) 367-9595. Sundays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-9 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays,
11 a.m.-10 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CUBAN PETE'S: You can call this an exotic family restaurant, one
of the few within a stone's throw of Disneyland. The menu, not
surprisingly, tends toward Cuban, but there are also wonderful dishes
of Puerto Rico, a combination of many influences. Don't miss the ham
croquettes, the mashed plantain dip mofongo, the roast leg of pork
and the terrific guava cheesecake. The atmosphere is lively, the
staff especially cheerful. Cuban Pete's, 1050 W. Ball Road, Anaheim.

Thursdays-Saturdays, 5 p.m.-2 a.m.; Sundays, 3-10 p.m. $$$</TE>

<TE>   DARYA: For Persian cuisine in an elegant, fine-dining environment,
South Coast Plaza Village has Darya. For entrees, try the seafood
platter (especially the shrimp), the boneless chicken kebab, and the
naderi kebab. Darya, South Coast Plaza Village, 1611 Sunflower Ave.,
Santa Ana, (714) 557-6600. Open daily for lunch, 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m.;

<TE>   DIZZ'S AS IS: Dizz's As Is has been around since the '70s--decades
longer, if you count the two previous restaurants, Ford's Cafe and
Polly's Pizza, that have occupied this location. Locals still line up
to eat retro specialties like cheese-stuffed veal chop, steak Diane
and swordfish Madagascar (menu changes daily), because seating is on
a first-come, first-served basis. The Art Deco dining rooms are a
hoot. Dizz's As Is, 2794 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (949)
494-5250. Dinner only Tuesdays-Thursdays, 5:30 (seating for dinner at
6)-9:30 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5:30 (seating for dinner at 6)-10

<TE>   EL CHOLO CANTINA: In its pleasant hacienda setting, El Cholo
Cantina features a CliffsNotes version of the El Cholo chain's
tried-and-true menu: cheese-heavy combo plates, nostalgia dishes such
as the Sonora-style enchilada topped with a fried egg--and, of
course, those famous sweet, green-corn tamales (May through October
only). El Cholo Cantina, 5465 Alton Parkway, Irvine. (949) 451-0044.
Lunch and dinner Sundays-Thursdays, 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m.;
Fridays-Saturdays, 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m. $</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EL FAROLITO: For 26 years, El Farolito has managed to please two
kinds of Mexican food customers: those who want forceful dishes like
birria and menudo and those who are looking for big margaritas and
cheese-rich enchiladas and nachos. It's a plain, friendly little
place where even rice and beans are tasty. Check out the excellent
steak Milanesa. El Farolito, 201 S. Bradford Ave., Placentia. (714)
993-7880. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily, 7 a.m.-9 p.m. $</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FIVE CROWNS: A theme restaurant that has been doing the Olde
English inn thing so long it's acquired a paradoxical authenticity.
The food's more than acceptable too. Salads and appetizers are always
good, and you can't go wrong ordering the roast duck or the prime
rib. Five Crowns, 3801 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (949)
760-0331. Dinner Mondays-Thursdays, 5-9:30 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays,
5-10 p.m.; Sundays, 4-9 p.m. Brunch Sundays, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. $$$</TE>

<TE>   FLORENCE ITALIAN CUISINE: Elegant but casual, Florence Italian
Cuisine offers an array of Italian favorites with an emphasis on
seafood. Try the lobster-filled ravioli de l'aragosta, the filet
mignon, the lasagna and the linguine vongole. For dessert, the
tiramisu and the spumoni. Florence Italian Cuisine, 14210 Culver
Drive (Heritage Plaza), Irvine. (949) 857-8265. Lunch and dinner
Mondays-Thursdays, 11:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m.; Fridays, 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m.;
dinner only Saturdays, 4-10 p.m.; brunch and dinner Sundays, 11
a.m.-9 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GRAND CAFE WOLFGANG PUCK: This is a dizzyingly eclectic spinoff of
Puck's successful cafe concept, including an express area, a
mini-mart and a greatly expanded menu. Many starters, such as sushi,
pad Thai and barbecued ribs, are Asian-inspired, to complement a menu
of wood-fired pizzas, upscale pastas, rotisserie meats and creative
main courses. Desserts, as one might imagine, are solidly appealing
and seriously indulgent. Grand Cafe Wolfgang Puck, the Block at
Orange. (714) 634-9653. Sundays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-10 p.m.;
Fridays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. All major credit cards. $$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GULFSTREAM: Formerly Cowboy Newport Beach, this seafood spot has a
hip, comforting American menu, plus a lively bar filled with the
young and the restless of Newport Beach. The best dishes on the menu
are wonderful fried jumbo shrimp, pan-roasted, cedar-plank salmon and
the terrific Caesar. The place also has a nice wine list and, even
better, no corkage fee. Gulfstream, 850 Avocado Ave., Newport Beach.
(949) 718-0187. Sundays, 4-9 p.m.; Mondays-Wednesdays, 5:30-10 p.m.;
Thursdays-Saturdays, 5:30-11 p.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IBIZA: After a tip of the hat to Spain, the jumping scene known as
Ibiza mostly roves in the realm of Asian fusion cuisine. In fact,
after the Flavors of Spain platter, go for Asian dishes such as
seared ahi rolled in cracked pepper. And then order a cocktail and
listen to the loud techno music. Ibiza, 209 Main St., Huntington
Beach. (714) 536-7887. Lunch and dinner daily, 11 a.m.-1:30 a.m. $$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I LOVE SUSHI: I Love Sushi may sound like a new situation comedy,
but it's really one of Orange County's best sushi restaurants, and at
shockingly low prices. Chef Tiger Nogi, a true visual artist, has a
deft hand with fish; his yellowtail and halibut sashimi are as
delicate as you'll ever taste. Come for lunch, when you'll easily get
a seat at the sushi bar and when the restaurant also serves a variety
of hearty rice bowls. I Love Sushi, 2340 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa.
(714) 540-6195. Lunch daily, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.; dinner

<TE>   INDIA COOK HOUSE: One of our more cheerful Indian restaurants,
though it holds no real surprises. The best dishes here are the meats
and bread cooked in the tandoor, or a cylindrical clay oven. But
there are also good chutneys, vindaloos, a few nice vegetable dishes
and fine homemade desserts. Don't miss gulab jamun, gold-colored
cheese balls served warm in syrup. India Cook House, 14130 Culver
Drive, Irvine. (949) 857-4858. Daily, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m., 5-10 p.m.
$$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JAVIER'S CANTINA: This restaurant bridges the gap between taqueria
authenticity and the happy-hour chips-and-salsa scene. Familiar
Mexican specialties are here, but it's the seafood specials like
brocheta del mar and the sweet, powerfully corn-flavored green-corn
tamale that make dealing with Laguna Beach parking worth it. Javier's
Cantina &amp; Grill, 480 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (949) 494-1239.
Lunch and dinner Mondays-Thursdays, 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m.;

<TE>   LEFT AT ALBUQUERQUE: With its blues soundtrack, Southwestern decor
and eclectic cooking style, this eatery is a bit of an odd duck. The
menu features a variety of mesquite-grilled meats and fish, along
with a huge list of premium tequilas. Try the griddled corn cake
appetizer, the Asian-tasting grilled Dixon pork. Left at Albuquerque,
3309 Michelson Drive, Irvine. (949) 757-7600. Sundays-Thursdays, 11
a.m.-10 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 11 a.m.-11 p.m. $$</TE>

<TE>   LUCIANA'S: Luciana's has been around since the early '80s, but
this rustic European restaurant is now managed by a new generation.
Chef Brett Young serves a combination of old Italian recipes and more
modern spinoffs. Especially good are his fagiolini verdi, fried green
beans, tomato bread soup (zuppa campagnola) and delicious
double-thick grilled pork chop glazed with balsamic vinegar.
Luciana's, 24312 Del Prado, Dana Point. (949) 661-6500. Dinner only
Sundays-Thursdays, 5-10 p.m.; Fridays-Saturdays, 5-11 p.m. $$$</TE>

<TE>   McCORMICK &amp; SCHMICK'S: There are 40 or more kinds of fresh seafood
on this menu, served in nearly 90 treatments. The inventive appetizer
menu is highlighted by excellent crab-and-shrimp cakes, and the
oyster selection is still one of the best around. The adjacent
Pilsner Room brew pub serves an impressive list of microbrews.
McCormick &amp; Schmick's, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (949) 756-0505.
Mondays-Fridays, 11 a.m.-11 p.m.; Saturdays, 5-11 p.m.; Sundays, 5-10
p.m. $$</TE>

<TE>   MOSUN: Hip, trendy Mosun, a place of black vinyl booths and
dancing Thursday through Saturday, is basically a Pacific Rim
restaurant. The food is of mixed quality--stick to the tuna tataki,
filet mignon won tons, New York steak basted with mirin and the
desserts. Mosun, 680 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (949) 497-5646.
Dinner Mondays-Wednesdays, 5-11 p.m.; Thursdays-Fridays, 5 p.m.-1

<TE>   MITSUYOSHI: There's a sushi bar here, but the appetizers are
better, especially the baked pike and the potato porridge (yamakake)
with chunks of tuna sashimi. Thin-cut pork cutlets (shoga-yaki) come
in a tangy sauce, and there's a massive sukiyaki and a festive
nabemono soup filled with meats, vegetables and noodles. Mitsuyoshi,
12033 Beach Blvd., Stanton. (714) 898-2156. Lunch Tuesdays-Fridays,
10 a.m.-2 p.m.; dinner Tuesdays-Saturdays, 5-10 p.m.; dinner Sundays,
5-9 p.m. $$</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MULBERRY STREET RISTORANTE: A cozy, welcoming setting for robust,
old-school Italian food. It's notable for dishes that achieve simple
harmony through a deft balance of flavors. For appetizers, try the
fried mozzarella and the steamed mussels. Exceptional entrees include
the steak Mulberry and the fettuccine Caruso. Mulberry Street
Ristorante, 114 W. Wilshire Ave., Fullerton. (714) 525-1056. Lunch

(Christy's) in Long Beach and also runs Nico's, a contemporary
American bistro on Naples Island. Her father, once a restaurant owner
himself, trained her well. Nico's is chic and modern with winning
decor and fine food. Try the Nico salad and the best bread pudding
around. Nico's, 5760 E. 2nd St., Long Beach. (562) 434-4479. Dinner

<TE>   OAK OVEN BARBECUE: The attraction at Lou's Oak Oven Barbecue is
Santa Maria-style barbecued tri-tip. But you can also get chicken,
pork loin and Portuguese sausage. The food comes on metal camping
plates, and drinks, including wine, are served in Mason jars, but
it's 200 miles closer than Santa Maria. Lou's Oak Oven Barbecue,
21501 Brookhurst St., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-5200. Lunch and

<TE>   ON THE BORDER and PAT AND OSCAR'S: Across the parking lot from
each other at the Market Place, On the Border and Pat and Oscar's
represent chains new to our area. One is a Cal-Mex joint with great
fajitas, lots of deep-fried appetizers and not much soul. The other
is a family-run, kid-oriented operation with forgettable pizzas, good
salads and what might be the best baked chicken on the planet. On the
Border, 13772 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 508-1060.

<TE>   OPAH: Opah is the latest restaurant from architect Mark Singer and
his Peruvian-born wife, Miriam, and has made an immediate impact on
the South County dining scene. The cuisine is eclectic and the decor
stylish, factors that draw a young, well-dressed crowd. Crab cakes
and a delicious oyster po'boy are among the best dishes, but several
main courses are lackluster. Opah, 26851 Aliso Creek Road, Suite C,

<TE>   OYSTERS: "Asian-influenced California cuisine"--well, you can't
blame Oysters for wanting to distance itself from all the bad fusion

<HD>A Tip for Diners at Spiral: Go Fish</HD>
<DH>Review* Industrial-like Huntington Beach restaurant, with
an Asian leaning, has more of a knack for seafood dishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spiral, as you might (or might not) guess, takes its name from the
spiral-wrapped shell of nori seaweed that encases Japanese hand
rolls. It's a fitting moniker for this Huntington Beach restaurant
because its menu wraps itself around myriad Asian culinary
influences, including Japanese, Thai and Chinese.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant's ambience is fashionably stark, designed to appeal
to a youngish crowd. Broadly speaking, its decor falls in line with
any number of hip Asian-fusion places these days--concrete floor,
high ceilings, an overall industrial feel--but it's attractive.</LD>
<LD>   This is a spacious room, with banquettes running along a wavy,
contoured wall on one side and a long sushi bar along the other. This
design certainly boosts the energy level, but it makes for an
intensely noisy room when the place is busy, and you may find
yourself exercising your vocal cords in conversation.</LD>
<TE>   In fairness, though, I should volunteer that on my first visit, my
table included a former rock critic (me) and a former Springsteen
session player (OK, post-"E Street," but still), and for the fragile
eardrums of recovering rockers like us, even the sound of knitting
needles counts as intrusive ambient noise.</TE>
<TE>   Spiral was indeed pretty busy on my first visit, and the waiters
were showing the strain. After 20 minutes, our waiter finally fought
his way to our table and apologetically offered us a complimentary
sake. The place was understaffed that night, he said, caught off
guard by a sudden surge in business after the post-holiday slump. We
ordered a couple of appetizers, waited another 20 minutes to get in a
sushi order, then 20 more to order entrees.</TE>
<TE>   When the food finally came, it was pretty much worth the wait,
though the wait had been considerable.</TE>
<TE>   We started with the six-seaweed salad. We couldn't actually pick
out six different seaweeds, but it was good. Crisp, fresh mesclun
formed a lush nest for the seaweed, and it had an excellent sweet
rice vinegar dressing.</TE>
<TE>   Next in line was the avocado and king crab salad, beautifully
presented in a tulip of sturdy, reddish greens. It's a rich dish,
heavier on the avocado than on the crab. The orange-pink dressing
it's tossed with has a pleasing dose of hot pepper that cuts against
the sweetness of the crab and avocado.</TE>
<TE>   The sushi itself is fresh and neatly arranged on a chilled glass
plate adorned with a banana leaf. Though there's a long list of
"specialty rolls," nothing on it jumps out as strikingly original. We
did like the spicy salmon roll, a slight twist on the familiar spicy
tuna roll (and actually more pungent than the average spicy tuna
roll).</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to entrees, Spiral is considerably more adept with
seafood than meat.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there's a very good lobster dish, described as
"Sezchuan braised." None of us could taste anything particularly
Sichuanese, or even Sezchuanese, about it, but it was tender and
flavorful. It arrived with the tail split and the claws cracked, on
vermicelli swimming in a mildly hot curry broth with a garnish of
sauteed oyster mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   We also liked the perfectly sauteed filet of king salmon, crisp on
the outside and succulent within. The menu says it's crusted in
herbs, without explanation; the herbs might be shredded green tea
leaves. In any case, they lend a complex, savory flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Chilean sea bass with wasabi pesto arrived lukewarm (service
problems again), but it was moist and firm. The sauce tasted more of
pesto than of wasabi, and though you might think pesto would clash
with this Asian treatment (the fish is marinated in miso), it worked
fine. The fish is served on rice with sauteed mushrooms and pickled
baby corn on the side.</TE>
<TE>   On my second weeknight visit, the service was pokey (though
amiable) again, even though there were only two other occupied
tables. I also found a notable disparity between some of the menu
descriptions and what arrived. The rack of lamb, for example: The
menu mentioned no stuffing, but the rack had a nondescript filling,
mostly breadcrumbs. I ordered it medium rare; it came somewhat
overdone, but unevenly so, and the five-spice jus was a murky
concoction with no dominant flavor. And instead of the pan-fried
noodles and mixed greens the menu said were coming, we got a slab of
potatoes cemented together with eggs like a Spanish tortilla de
patata and some undercooked green beans.</TE>
<TE>   This was when I began to conclude that Spiral is much better at
handling fish than meat. The filet mignon, marinated in soy and
served on a puddle of undistinguished oyster sauce, was on the tough
side, and it, too, was a bit overdone. But redemption came with the
pan-seared tuna with pungent ginger-wasabi sauce. Crusted with pepper
and black sesame seeds, it was perfectly seared on the outside and
rare within. We also like the shrimp fried rice, which was spiked
with basil and topped with a flavorful peanut dressing and a paper
thin omelet.</TE>
<TE>   At dessert time, the Spiramisu is a thing of beauty: a thin cone
of dark chocolate containing a rather dense tiramisu propping up a
bulb of intense vanilla bean ice cream. Less visually stunning, but
more flavorful altogether, was the apple-almond tart.</TE>
<TE>   Spiral is moderate to expensive. Appetizers and salads run $5-$9,
entrees $14-$26, desserts $6. Sushi is $3-$5 per item, sushi rolls
$5-$12, sushi combinations $18-$26. Beer, wine and sake available.</TE>

<HD>In LaBute's 'Bash,' Nothing Is Easy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can't cozy up to Neil LaBute. "In the Company of Men," his
controversial movie about a pair of wormy guys out to seduce and
destroy a woman, may have been the feel-bad flick of 1997. It
simmered with despicability, daring the audience to consider just how
low someone can limbo when sexual and emotional sabotage is the game.</LD>
<LD>   LaBute may be more humane, even sentimental, in "Bash," but he
still refuses to make it easy.</LD>
<LD>   That works just fine for the Hunger Artists Theatre Company, which
has mounted an intimate production in its living-room-sized Santa Ana
playhouse. Divided into three disturbing monologues, "Bash" seems to
welcome claustrophobia, and director Katie Chidester puts the actors
an arm's reach away, making it impossible to ignore these stories.</LD>
<TE>   The first two episodes of the 1999 drama are the best, shifting
from unsettling to absorbing in an instant. They're confessions,
really, underlining LaBute's fear that lives can change terribly if
the wrong decision is made.</TE>
<TE>   In "Iphigenia in Orem," a man (Mark Coyan) sits nervously in front
of us, talking to an unseen visitor he met in a bar. Coyan comes
across as your typical mid-level executive, eager to make a
connection. Slowly he reveals the circumstances of his daughter's
death, what he did and didn't do, and the dreadful burden of it all.</TE>
<TE>   If there's zero justification for events in "Iphigenia in Orem,"
there may be less than zero in the next piece, "Gaggle of Saints."
This time, we see a young couple, John (Russ Marchand) and Sue
(Jessica Beane), who are as golden as they come. But when the funny,
likable John tells of a violent encounter with a gay man in
Manhattan's Central Park, the pleasant vibe falls away like a rock
thrown in a muddy pond. It's chilling to realize that John will carry
this secret forever. Even as Sue squeals about the upcoming wedding,
gazing at her man with love, you know the seed has been planted for
sadness, and possibly worse, ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The last cautionary tale is "Medea Redux," and it's the least
interesting, limping into predictability and lacking definition. A
woman (Jami McCoy) is apparently being interrogated and eventually
recounts how she was seduced at 13 by a teacher. She has a baby, and,
much later, we learn something horrible has occurred and that's why
she's being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy is sensitive to her character's confusion and pain, but
LaBute hasn't given her much to work with. It's especially
frustrating that the teacher is such a blurry creation; there's never
less than vague hints of why the woman was drawn to him in the first
place and what the dimensions of their relationship have become. The
mystery of who we are and what we're capable of is at the core of
LaBute's writing, but here the unknown is just too great.</TE>

<DH>Lis J. Schwitters' circular images, ranging from playful to
mystical, find beauty in the banal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the artwork of Lis J. Schwitters, the scenery may be vaguely
familiar, but the context has changed radically. A photographer and
printmaker with a fondness for extending her media, she likes to take
banal, everyday source materials and turn them into what she calls
"cyanotype mandalas."</LD>
<LD>   These are kaleidoscopic hyper-images that spin off the meditative
tradition of Tibetan mandalas, using the blueprint-like cyanotype
process. This roughhewn, low-tech process supports the artist's
intrigue with early forms of Modernism, from Russian Constructivism
to early 20th century photographic experiments. The works are full of
visual echoes and a general sense of evoking both a suspension of
reality and the creation of a new one.</LD>
<LD>   Schwitters' work has been showing up around the county of late in
various group shows, but seeing her current one-person show at
Buenaventura Gallery, "Circular Visions of Ventura," is the best way
to get familiar with her aesthetic mission.</LD>
<TE>   Multiple hands appear as the source for "A Pledge of Allegiance,"
which then morphs into an image suggesting surreal and/or alien plant
life. Sometimes, the transformations take bizarre turns, as with an
image of orchids that, in its replicated form, suddenly looks bovine.</TE>
<TE>   The work can dabble in optical trickery, as with "Demarcation
Point," with road signs for the 101 and California Street, or
"Inkblot Test #182," making the natural link between her work and
Rorschach test blots. Things go from word-playful, as in the
scrambled Scrabble effect of "Party Platter," to mystical, as in "The
White Radiance of Eternity."</TE>
<TE>   With this work, Schwitters is gamely toying with different ideas,
blending photographic reproduction and mixed-media reconstruction. In
short, she renders basic, concrete images abstract and hypnotic, but
within her own tightly controlled parameters. Reality is kept on a
rubbery tether.</TE>
<TE>   * Lis J. Schwitters, "Circular Visions of Ventura," Buenaventura
Gallery, 700 E. Santa Clara St., Ventura. Ends Feb. 2. Gallery hours:
Tuesdays to Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (805) 648-1235.</TE>
<TE>   Fledgling Talents: In what has become one of Ventura County's
enduring, endearing annual traditions, January brings with it the
celebration of the area's finest--and youngest--classical music
talents. The New West Symphony's "Discovery Artists" concert, in
Oxnard and Thousand Oaks this weekend, gives a handful of gifted
students an opportunity to perform on a real stage with a
professional orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   There's history here, going back to the Young Artists Competition
of the Ventura County Symphony. After that orchestra was merged into
the New West, the program was extended and further developed, as a
function of the New West's operations. In this weekend's program, the
"Discovery Artist" roster includes clarinetist Richard Stone, soprano
Jamie Franceshi, pianist Karine Poghosyan and piccolo player Laurel
Schwartz. One alumna of the series, 13-year-old Katrina Celeste
Bobbs, was heard on violin last year and returns on the piano this
year.</TE>
<TE>   By its nature, the program tends to be a broad sampler. The
soloists will be tackling movements of works by Mozart, Ravel,
Vivaldi, Puccini, Beethoven and others. On the orchestra front, the
de facto New West Symphony will open the concert with Glinka's
"Russlan and Ludmilla" overture, and, for the finale, they'll be
joined by the New West Youth Symphony All-Stars for "The Great Gate
of Kiev," from Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition."</TE>
<TE>   It's an all-around positive event. Besides being a chance to
listen in on budding classical music talents from our midst, more
generally it says something about the continuity of musical culture
at a time when classical music is experiencing lean times.</TE>
<TE>   * New West Symphony, "Discovery Artists"; 7:30 p.m. Friday, Oxnard
Performing Arts Center, 800 Hobson Way, Oxnard; 7:30 p.m. Saturday,
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand
Oaks. $8 to $19. (800) NEW-WEST.</TE>
<TE>   Still Alive and Well: The Rubicon Theatre Co.'s season continues
this weekend with a trusty musical confection, "Jacques Brel Is Alive
and Well (and Living in Paris)." The piece, adapted by Eric Blau and
Mort Schuman, celebrates the urbane wit of Brel. For this production,
the principals are Amanda McBroom--Ojai's own, who wrote "The
Rose"--and George Ball, who performed the cabaret-ish piece off
Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Brel, the French Belgian singer-songwriter, influenced a wide
array of performers, including David Bowie. This revue of his songs
opened in 1968 in Greenwich Village, and Brel appeared in a film
version in 1974. He died of lung cancer at the too-young age of 49,
in 1978. The Brel myth continues, partly with the help of this revue.</TE>
<TE>   * "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well (and Living in Paris)," Rubicon
Theatre at the Laurel Theatre, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura. Previews:
Today and Friday, 8 p.m.; $23. Gala opening: Saturday, 7 p.m.; $150,

<HD>Thirst for Answers Now to Prevent Water Shortages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT M. HERTZBERG and RONALD R. GASTELUM</AU>
<BD>Robert M. Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) is speaker of the
California Assembly. Ronald R. Gastelum is general manager of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people think about water only in that brief instant before they
turn on a faucet. When the water flows, as it almost always does,
they simply go on with life.</LD>
<LD>   But what if it doesn't? In the coming year, both weather and
politics could affect California's water supply. We need to take
decisive action now to avoid a water crisis like the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   In urban Southern California, the average family of four living in
a single-family home pays about $30 per month for all the water they
need. The same family pays $60 to $90 per month for electricity and
nearly $800 for groceries.</LD>
<TE>   It takes a drought, earthquake or terrorist attack to make us
think about the value of our water supplies. While this winter's rain
and snowfall levels seem to be healthy, all we need is a dry year or
two and we'll have severe water shortages in many parts of the state.
So what do we do to avoid a water crisis?</TE>
<TE>   First, we must start taking responsibility for our water use.
Californians are capable of conservation; we used 8.8% less
electricity during peak hours in October 2001 than the year before.
There is no reason we cannot expect the same kind of widespread
support for water conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Second, elected officials, water district managers and business,
agricultural and environmental leaders must implement final
agreements on the CalFed program. CalFed is a collaborative state and
federal effort to save the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a system of
waterways that provides drinking water to two-thirds of the state and
irrigation water to more than 7 million acres of farmland. Advancing
the CalFed program is critical to replacing water that will be lost
when California is required by the federal government to live within
its allocation of Colorado River water. By following through with the
agreement, we can ensure there is enough good water for the
environment, people and economy of California for 30 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   Third, we must recognize that many of the solutions to our water
problems can be found at the local and regional levels. There are
ample opportunities to make our existing water system in Southern
California more efficient and less dependent on imported water, such
as conservation, recycling, ground water storage, desalination and
cleanup of contaminated ground water basins.</TE>
<TE>   Two laws that just took effect this month will strengthen state
laws that require a demonstration of sufficient water supplies to
meet water demand before approving large new residential or
commercial developments.</TE>
<TE>   This will test our resolve to adequately plan and provide for our
future.</TE>
<TE>   If we have learned anything from last year's energy crisis, it is
that some disasters can be avoided by getting the word out early. We
should not wait for our state's water shortage to become a segment on
the evening news before we do something.</TE>

<HD>Today's Game Is Brinkmanship, Not Nuclear War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brinkmanship--deliberately going to the brink to make some strategic
gain without actually going to war.</LD>
<LD>   During the Cold War it was a standard diplomatic tactic used by
both the United States and the Soviet Union. It happened over Berlin
several times, over Cuba in 1962 and over the Middle East in 1973.
Each time, these brinkmanship crises frightened the world before
ending without a shot being fired.</LD>
<LD>   Now that both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, they too
are trying their hand at brinkmanship. But can they avoid a slide
into war? They share a hot border in Kashmir where there is shooting
every day, a dangerous complication that American and Soviet leaders
never had to face.</LD>
<TE>   India wants to persuade Pakistan to abandon its post-1989 policy
of supporting armed movements that operate inside the Indian part of
Kashmir and have staged attacks deep within India, including the Dec.
13 attack on the Indian Parliament that threatened to decapitate the
Indian government and even in failure killed 14 people.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1989, the violence in Indian Kashmir was confined to small
groups of local Muslims who were fighting for Kashmir's independence.
One reason why Pakistan's well-funded Inter-Services Intelligence, or
ISI, started sponsoring armed Islamic militants in 1989 was to
displace the original Kashmir independence movement with one seeking
to join Pakistan. As an army general, Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf was a leading proponent of sending Islamic militants to
fight in Kashmir--not because he favored Islamic terrorism but as a
way of outmaneuvering both India's military superiority and the
nuclear checkmate.</TE>
<TE>   News reports continue to focus on two small organizations, the
Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, because both have been
implicated in the Dec. 13 attack. Actually, even before the present
crisis, the Pakistani government was unhappy with the Jaish and the
Lashkar, because their leaders were talking of an independent Islamic
state in Kashmir and because their super-extremism frightened even
the ISI. It was therefore not much of a sacrifice for Musharraf to
cut off support for the two organizations and to order the detention
of their chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   But the Indians are demanding that Pakistan also cut off all the
other fighting organizations including Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, which is
the armed wing of the Jamaat-i-Islami, the most important Islamic
party in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In speeches, Musharraf is preparing Pakistanis for more action
against Islamic extremism in general, but so far he has refused to
shut down all the organizations; that would amount to giving up the
fight for Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf also has refused to hand over for trial those whom India
identified as responsible for the Dec. 13 attack absent more
"convincing evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Indian army and navy are mobilizing. The most
dramatic Indian move has been the forward deployment of a missile
group, with 12 launchers for short-range ballistic missiles,
supposedly armed with nuclear warheads. The Pakistanis have responded
by mobilizing their Chinese-made M-11 missiles, which are also are
supposedly armed with nuclear warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the best evidence that India is engaged in brinkmanship rather
than actually preparing for war is that little is being done to keep
preparations secret.</TE>
<TE>   It also is significant that Lal Krishna Advani, India's minister
of home affairs, was in Washington last week, and that Defense
Minister George Fernandes was there this week. If the Indians were
planning a war, both certainly would have remained home.</TE>
<TE>   Before the nuclear age, attempts at brinkmanship often failed
because governments lost control of public opinion, which insisted on
greater victories--or smaller defeats--than diplomacy could achieve.
The Indian and Pakistani governments are constrained by public
opinion, Musharraf perhaps more so because he has weakened his
Islamic credentials by cooperating with the United States against the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore there is terrible danger that the two governments will
talk themselves into a war, unable to step back because of the
pressure of their public opinion. Another danger is a spontaneous
outbreak. Shooting incidents are common along the Line of Control in
Kashmir, and now there are many more troops within rifle range of one
another.</TE>
<TE>   So far, both Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee have been playing a cool diplomatic game centered on
Washington; both are hoping for more U.S. support as the crisis
continues. So long as each remains in control of his own side, the
crisis can be kept under control.</TE>
<TE>   As head of a center-right coalition seen as tough on Kashmir and
Pakistan, Vajpayee is fairly safe from parliamentary pressures to
escalate the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But because he has abruptly changed Pakistan's policy from the
encouragement and physical support of extremism in both Afghanistan
and Pakistan, Musharraf is vulnerable. If he were to be overthrown by
coup d'etat or eliminated by assassination, the world could be faced
with a nuclear crisis.</TE>

<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Racism is for white people, says the common wisdom. We are guilty by
inheritance. All of us. Each of us corrupted in his normal heart. We
are history's prime plunderers, wearing in public discourse the
scarlet "R" of cultural remorse. Many of us do so gladly because
basking in guilt somehow assuages it. Self-deprecation half cleanses
us of the past.</LD>
<LD>   African Americans often play a scripted role in this perverse
exchange as well by meeting whites' far-flung penance with
entitlement. Whites accept enduring culpability and moral inferiority
but retain some implied status as overlords, arrogant givers of
retributive largess. In exchange, blacks retain their cultural
innocence, but they also retain the odious status of underlings,
victims forever beholden to white magnanimity and what has been
called the soft racism of low expectations.</LD>
<LD>   This is the silent bargain we've made over race in the United
States. It nurses a status quo that few challenge.</LD>
<TE>   But this month, with the release of his controversial and much
anticipated book "Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word,"
Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy may help invigorate the debate.
His etymology of the "N-word" is far-reaching and refreshing: "As a
linguistic landmark, nigger is being renovated. Blacks use the term
with novel ease to refer to other blacks . . . whites are
increasingly referring to other whites as niggers, and indeed, the
term both as an insult and as a sign of affection is being affixed to
people of all sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "For bad or good, nigger is thus destined to remain with us for
many years to come--a reminder of the ironies and dilemmas, the
tragedies and glories, of the American experience."</TE>
<TE>   But when blacks use the N-word are they partaking in racism
themselves? Kennedy says that depends on intent. Of course, many
blacks use the term endearingly, he concedes, as a way of reclaiming
rather than invoking the old slur. But they use it derogatorily too.
So is this black-on-black racism? If so, is it simply internalized
self-hatred borrowed from whites or is it endemic venom?</TE>
<TE>   In her shocking and bold new play "Yellowman," African American
playwright Dael Orlandersmith ventures an unpopular view of black
culpability. Now playing in Princeton, N.J., and poised to make a
bicoastal tour, "Yellowman" tells the story of a light-skinned boy
named Eugene and his darker-skinned playmate Alma, star-crossed
lovers growing up in a bitterly divided South Carolina community of
Gullahs--descendants of slaves who worked coastal cotton and rice
fields--in the 1960s. As they mature, they are slowly, then violently
ripped apart by familial racism. The Gullahs speak their own
African-derived Geechie dialect. Yet still, they define darker skin
as ugly, though more authentically black, and lightness as beautiful
but at the same time traitorous and detestable because it is seen as
having eluded the harshest burdens of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Orlandersmith makes liberal and jarring use of Kennedy's N-word,
to similar effect. It grates. But there is no question of intent. In
the climactic scene, the light-skinned Eugene and his dark-skinned
father fight, brutally hurling the bywords of anti-black feeling at
each other.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's and Orlandersmith's probing, audacious new treatments of
what musician and critic Stanley Crouch called the "all-American skin
game" and the epithet that drives it are a welcome change from the
usual gruel. They remind us that hate is not race-specific. Black
racism, when conceived purely as a response to white racism, absolves
blacks of the responsibility for their own prejudices and locks them
into a demeaning co- dependency with specious white power.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the best way to keep hate from ruling us is to strip
the meaning from the words behind which it tries to hide.</TE>

<LD>Every day brings new revelations of corporate malfeasance at Enron.
As congressional and Justice Department investigations proceed, new
scandals will emerge and reforms will be debated. But one of the
worst abuses is already clear: the loss of an estimated $1 billion in
Enron employee pension benefits.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has asked the Treasury Department to study reforms
of the voluntary tax-free pension savings plans known as 401(k)s, but
it doesn't take a finance genius to see that immediate action is
needed to protect employees' retirements. The issue is all the more
crucial because fewer and fewer employers offer traditional pensions,
which provide set monthly payments after retirement.</LD>
<LD>   Enron is hardly a unique case when it comes to pension benefits.
At Lucent Technologies, for example, employees who saw the value of
their pension savings virtually erased say they too were the victims
of over-optimistic earnings projections and unclear accounting
practices.</LD>
<TE>   There was another, separate problem at Enron, an oddly timed
"lockdown" during a changeover of plan administrators. The net effect
was to prevent employees from selling company-matched stock right
after corporate chieftains dumped theirs. Such behavior is not what
Congress had in mind when it first authorized 401(k) plans in 1974.
They were supposed to encourage workers to save for the future, not
destroy their assets.</TE>
<TE>   It would be easy to say that this is just tough luck for investors
who put too much of their tax-deferred pension funds into company
stock. Bush's top economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, has called
the collapse of Enron a "triumph for capitalism"--ultimately only the
fittest survive. But survival of capitalism itself depends on
investors being confident that the system is not rigged. That
includes employee-investors, whose 401(k) and similar funds now
constitute Americans' most popular retirement programs.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government needs to develop for 401(k)s and similar
plans the kind of regular scrutiny that mutual funds receive.
Employees, who are usually on their own in choosing 401(k) options,
need investment advice from independent advisors. They need
investment education. If a company like Enron is cooking the books,
however, even the savviest investor may be doomed, especially if
forbidden to sell company stock.</TE>
<TE>   This is why perhaps the most important proposed changes are those
in a bill by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.).
The measure would cap employer stock contribution matches at 20% and
limit to 90 days the period in which an employer may force investors
to hold on to company stock. Currently, employers can force retention
of company stock for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Employers have no legal obligation to provide 401(k) plans. If
reform goes too far, then employers may simply decline to match
employee contributions, with stocks or anything else. Also, it is
possible that the 20% provision is too stringent from employees'
perspective. But the need to encourage diversification is clear; the
90-days provision would allow employees to invest sooner in a variety
of stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Protecting employees and making it attractive for companies to
provide matching benefits will require compromise. But as the Enron
case shows, Congress must act.</TE>

<LD>As anyone who has recently shopped for a cell phone knows, the
options are endless. Want a phone the size and heft of a Hershey bar?
They make it. Voice-activated dialing and picture-caller ID? No
problem. Optional FM radio? Web access? Your choice of 30 irritating
ring tones?</LD>
<LD>   There is seemingly no feature that the U.S. cellular industry
can't provide its customers--except so-called number portability,
which would allow cell phone users to keep the same number when
switching carriers.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission in 1996 ordered mobile phone
companies to offer this convenience in the nation's 100 largest
markets as a way to increase competition and broaden consumer
choices. The industry stalled and dragged its feet, missing two
deadlines. The latest deadline is Nov. 24, but rather than working to
meet it, the largest mobile service providers, led by Verizon
Wireless, have asked the FCC to drop the mandate altogether.</LD>
<TE>   It's easy to see why. Many cell phone subscribers put up with poor
service rather than switch providers because it's just too much of a
hassle to change phone numbers already publicized on business cards
or circulated among customers and friends--who no doubt then
programmed them into their own cell phones. An industry infamous for
poor customer service is in no hurry to make it easier for
subscribers to bail out.</TE>
<TE>   That is not, of course, what the industry says.</TE>
<TE>   It will cost too much, say mobile phone companies that routinely
spend millions developing ever smaller phones, ever faster
transmission and ever newer features.</TE>
<TE>   It will kill a fledgling industry, says an expanding industry that
has seen its market double between 1999 and 2001 to 123 million
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a pain technically, say innovators who are fast
developing always-on systems that combine the functions of phone,
computer and pager.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense. Regular, wired phone companies have already retooled
their networks to provide local number portability. If consumers
switch their home phone service from AT&amp;T, say, to Sprint, they
aren't forced to get a new phone number. The FCC should hold wireless
service to the same standard. Allow number portability and cell phone
companies will have to try to keep customers the old-fashioned
way--by improving service.</TE>

<LD>California, already holding primary elections in March to select
nominees for November, may soon be in the even more bizarre position
of holding its primary elections in February. State officials should
demand that the Democratic National Committee reject a plan to make
the party's presidential primaries even earlier than they now are
held. The committee's vote is scheduled Friday in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   California's primary used to be in June. But the state moved it to
late March and then early March to regain clout in choosing the
parties' presidential nominees. Now the Democrats (each party gets to
make its own presidential primary rules) want to push the
presidential season even earlier, to Jan. 19, 2004, for the Iowa
caucuses and Jan. 27 for the New Hampshire primary, traditionally the
nation's first. That means other states could schedule their
primaries as early as Feb. 3. Republicans probably would be forced to
do the same.</LD>
<LD>   California need not join the rush to early February, but it
previously followed the pack. Many states hold separate primaries in
presidential election years, which gets rid of the problem of
10-month state and local campaigns. New York, for instance, held its
latest presidential primary in March and its primary for the
Legislature, Congress and state offices in September.</LD>
<TE>   California resisted dual primaries because of the extra cost, and
the Legislature compounded the problem by moving primaries to March
in non-presidential years. That's why state and congressional
nominees will be picked March 5, after which all Californians will
endure eight months of campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Separating the California primaries should be seriously
considered, though it wouldn't do anything to cure the mania of
national Democratic leaders for ever-earlier balloting. They claim
that Republicans grabbed voter attention during a month of battle
between George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain in Delaware, South
Carolina, Arizona and Michigan primaries. The Democrats had no
primaries during that period following the New Hampshire voting and
don't want to be upstaged again, especially with an incumbent
president running.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties should understand that pushing primaries into January
is no answer.</TE>
<TE>   Every campaign has its own dynamic. Certainly the entire 2000
Democratic primary campaign didn't generate much excitement. If the
parties want to attract voters they will begin by making presidential
campaigns shorter, not longer. In the meantime, California should go
its own way and separate the state primary.</TE>

<LD>Re "Davis' Borrowing Spree," editorial, Jan. 14: Ah, now I get it.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis will not raise taxes; however, he will raise fees.
Isn't that great. You can deduct taxes from your federal return. Fees
you just get to pay. What a deal.</LD>

<TE>   The states should increase income taxes. These taxes are
deductible from the federal taxes, so there would be no net effect on
the taxpayer. Taxpayers would welcome having the control of their
taxes closer to home. As long as the federal government is chasing
schemes like missile defense, our money would be more responsibly
used by the states.</TE>

<TE>   Let's see, we're in a state that has the dubious distinction of
having one of the greatest income disparities between rich and poor.
Our high cost of housing has placed us third in the nation, after New
York and Hawaii, in having the smallest percentage of homeowners.
Now, Gov. Davis has targeted his deepest cuts at some of California's
most vulnerable residents, from welfare recipients to low-income
working parents to the mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   Just as CalWORKS is getting people off the welfare rolls, let's
just kick them not only down but out. Brilliant. The very possible
increase in crime born from despair can then fill the prisons.
Another stroke of genius. The state will no longer be desperate for
affordable housing. I think we're in the Twilight Zone.</TE>

<LD>Re "Don't Destroy the Wild Places for Oil," Commentary, Jan. 14: I
would like to commend Vice Adm. James E. Service for advocating the
preservation of our Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I completely
agree with his advocating a reduction in the consumption of oil. I
would like to state that the technology to increase fuel mileage is
not only at hand but has been available for years. I make the
following technical suggestions.</LD>
<LD>   Reduce the front profile; reduce the weight; reduce the engine
size. As a driver of a Ford Escort, I guarantee that major increases
in mileage are available now. I get 30 mph in town and 40 mph on the
highway.</LD>
<LD>   These fixes would be very difficult to implement as long as we are
told to "win the war--spend and consume," as I drive down the freeway
at 70 mph and am passed by patriotic SUVs flying American flags,
spending and consuming as fast as they can.</LD>
<TE>   M.E. Wheelock</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Service for telling it like it is with regard to the
folly of drilling in the ANWR. I recently traded my gas-guzzling SUV
for a Toyota Prius hybrid (averaging 47 mpg thus far!) and guess
what? I still get to work on time. My groceries still fit in my
trunk. I still have a CD player with a good sound system.</TE>
<TE>   And I have the sense of pride and patriotism that comes not from
mounting a flag on my SUV but from knowing that I am doing my share
to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Let's all do it this way,
not by drilling in the ANWR.</TE>

<LD>Re ''MTA to Add Electric Scooters, Bicycles to Its Fleet,'' Jan. 12:
OK, let me get this straight. The MTA wants to spend taxpayer money
to provide folks too lazy to walk a few blocks, or ride a regular
human-powered bike, with electric transportation?</LD>
<LD>   If the MTA did more to promote its bikes on buses and Metrorail
programs, especially by allowing bicyclists on the rail lines at all
hours and without the hassle of a permit, it would be doing something
a lot more constructive to ease parking congestion on our streets,
not to mention at transit stations and park-and-ride lots.</LD>

<HD>Magnet School's Origins Rooted in Community</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the founding chair of the Community Magnet School, I can
sympathize with Carol Lynn Mithers ("LAUSD's Building Fantasy,"
Opinion, Jan. 13). The Community School, as it was originally called,
opened its doors as an alternative school on the split sites of
Canfield Avenue and Crescent Heights elementary schools in 1974. It
took two years of hard bargaining and a threat of a lawsuit to get
the LAUSD to accept the concept of a neighborhood integration plan
that combined volunteers from the student bodies of Canfield (96%
Anglo) and Crescent Heights (98% black), located less than one mile
apart on Airdrome Street. The idea was to operate the Community
School as an autonomous mini-school at each site. This concept lasted
only three years when the district, under pressure from Canfield
parents, gave us an ultimatum: Move the program to the site of
then-Pasteur Junior High or lose it. After much debate the school was
relocated.</LD>
<TE>   The Community School was well documented in the article, but it
has never been accorded the recognition it so rightly deserves for
one major reason: LAUSD is very uncomfortable with a school that is
governed by its parents, students and faculty. As successful as the
Community Magnet School has become, its model has seen little or no
replication, a testament to the myopia that infects the school
district. I say to Mithers: Don't give up. Keep making as loud a
noise as needed, because the bright light of public attention is one
thing the LAUSD detests.</TE>
<TE>   Clive Hoffman</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every voter should clip and save Mithers' article. Then, every
time the drumbeat starts for more government power and more taxes and
electoral candidates who propose more, voters should reread the
article and vote resoundingly "no."</TE>

<HD>Harvard: Summers' Feedback Taken Amiss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peer review is a pillar of academe, which makes the tense standoff
between Harvard President Lawrence Summers and Harvard superstar
professor Cornel West all the more unfortunate and ridiculous ("The
Summers of Harvard U.'s Black Discontent," Commentary, Jan. 11). As
institutions of higher learning, universities are centers of debate
and engines in the search for truth and objectivity. West's
uneasiness with the constructive feedback of Summers, however,
reveals that some professors refuse to adhere to even minimal
professional standards. Since when did higher education become an
exercise in flattery?</LD>
<LD>   To West's credit, the fact that he ventured outside of academia to
assume additional roles is commendable. In fact, such action helps to
bridge the gap between theory and the real world. But to trivialize
this incident as one of insensitivity or even racism misses a darker
trend throughout university campuses. Indeed, West's discomfort with
Summers' peer review points to the creeping conservatism of academe's
"diverse" voices.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stuart Green's defense of historian Stephen Ambrose's plagiarism
makes the point that plagiarism is not synonymous with inaccuracy
(Commentary, Jan. 13). He states that fellow historians have a right
to censure Ambrose but dismisses that right with the statement that
no one claims his books are inaccurate. This is a blase dismissal of
a serious issue. Not every book is examined for errors. Errors may
not be detected for years, and when detected the misinformation may
be so popular that attempts to correct the information are ignored.</LD>
<LD>   When a historian plagiarizes another writer we are denied the
honesty of original research. If the first writer makes an error, the
second one repeats it and less conscientious writers continue to
repeat it until it is installed as the common view. Then teachers,
opinion writers, editors and others who form public opinion base
their views on it. Plagiarism may not be synonymous with inaccuracy
but it will perpetuate it.</LD>
<LD>   David J. Oliphant</LD>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is a disservice to serious scholars and students to dismiss
Ambrose's omissions as simple inaccuracies. It is not the reader's
job to ferret out which comments are the author's or emanate from a
list of references at the back of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Donald A. Eisner</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remember, if you borrow from one person it's plagiarism; if you
borrow from several it's called research. I'm not quite sure who said
that . . . then again, I may have thought of it myself. Right! I'll
take the credit. Thank you.</TE>

<LD>There is something fundamentally perverse about a society in which
one woman needs $320,000 per month for child support ("Child Support
Case Lifts Covers on Lifestyle of Rich," Jan. 14) and another is
forced to sell a video for $3 to buy macaroni and cheese to eat that
day ("Homeless, Helpless, Hopeless," Jan. 12). While millions in L.A.
County and the nation struggle to pay for food, shelter and some
amenities for themselves and their children, the rich gorge
themselves in an orgy of consumption that rivals France in 1789.</LD>
<LD>   That the rich continue to indulge in such luxury is not
surprising: They have convinced themselves that they "earned" it and
deserve such benefits. It never ceases to amaze me, however, that
more are not enraged by the staggering economic injustice that shapes
life in the U.S. We continue to believe that things have
fundamentally changed since Sept. 11. They have not: Obscene wealth
and desperate poverty go hand in hand. How desperate must Americans
become before we wake up to this tragedy?</LD>

<TE>   Kirk Kerkorian's 3-year-old daughter needs $300,000-plus per month
living expenses? Her monthly individual food requirements could feed
an entire Afghanistan orphanage for months if not years. (How much
can a 3-year-old eat?) Is it any wonder why we are so despised by
many in the Third World?</TE>

<LD>Our president has now reneged on his promise to Russian President
Vladimir Putin to dismantle thousands of nuclear weapons as part of
our unilateral withdrawal from the ABM treaty (Jan. 13). I recall
that President Bush was asked how we could trust the Russians to
diminish their own nuclear stockpile as their part of this deal. He
stated that no formal agreement was needed and that he could trust
Putin after "looking the man in the eye." Unfortunately, Putin
appears to be a poor judge of character to have trusted Bush to
deliver on his promise. In the spirit of its Enron cronies, perhaps
the Bush administration should consider declaring moral bankruptcy.</LD>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / PACIFIC PALISADES</KH>
<HD>Neighbors Meet to Share Sunsets and Much More</HD>
<DH>High atop an ocean bluff, an informal ritual at day's end
brings longtime residents together to visit, wonder and reflect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sun slips toward the horizon behind a low band of clouds. Like
ancient worshipers, the neighbors begin to gather at the top of the
cliff, high above the rush-hour traffic on Pacific Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Emil Wroblicky is here just as he's been most days for the last 15
years. He comes for the same reason they all come: This
230-foot-tall, west-facing bluff in Pacific Palisades may be the best
spot in Southern California to watch the day end.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the best place in the world, really," Wroblicky says as
the reddish dusk settles over his wife, Alice, and a dozen other
members of their early evening coterie. "I love coming here in the
morning after I read the paper. And we come out to see the sunset
before dinner."</LD>
<TE>   No one has tracked the informal ritual as to when it started or
how. That hardly matters. The point is that something beautiful is
visible almost every day from the tiny park at the end of Via de Las
Olas, a street closed to car traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Certain locations, especially seaside promontories, seem to touch
some powerful yearning to catch evening's sky show. This sliver of
coastal shelf is one of those vantage points. When the winds aren't
too stiff, and when ruffled clouds create the chance for solar
pyrotechnics, the crowd may number 50 or more.</TE>
<TE>   Some bring blankets, snacks and beverages. In winter, most just
throw on jackets and gaze out over the ocean. They've come to know
each other. They threw a bluff-top party for Albert Androsky's 82nd
birthday. He bought his cliff-top home in 1962, paying $42,000 for a
place now worth $1.5 million, but he is lonely since his wife died a
few years ago. He paints out the graffiti that occasionally appears
on the white rail fence bordering the bluff.</TE>
<TE>   A woman known only as "Mother Theresa"--she declines to give her
full name--walks or rides her bike to the cliff from a few miles
away. She greets everyone and dispenses neighborhood gossip, talking
like the tough dame in an old movie. Her favorite expression is
baby--as in, "There goes the sun, baby."</TE>
<TE>   The loose camaraderie and the sheer magnificence of the view--the
amber light on the water, the cars below like slow-moving toys on
PCH, the silhouette of the Santa Monica Mountains to the north--fill
a gap in the lives of the mostly older Palisades residents in ways
that are sometimes difficult to fully grasp.</TE>
<TE>   "Your whole being just opens up," says Lucille Rader, 78, who
lives near the crest of the hill. She drives down and takes her
evening walk at sunset. The conversations are sometimes the first
she's had all day. People discuss personal hardships, loved ones,
trips they took--or they just stand in wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I go there and have a little cry now and then," says
Rader, who lost her husband 12 years ago. From so high, it seems you
can see the curvature of the Earth, the spinning machinery of the
heavens. The sight of the sun sinking beyond the horizon dwarfs the
problems of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm there, I know I'll see [Paul] again," Rader says.
"There's no doubt. If we have this beautiful universe, there has to
be someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   The cliff is a local treasure. Few people take note of the cliff
except when driving by it on Pacific Coast Highway or hearing news
reports about a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   One constant of the California rainy season is the chance of
traffic snarls due to slides in the Palisades and Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have noted more than 30 road-closing slides in Pacific
Palisades alone since 1911, according to historian Randy Young. That
number involves only three miles of coastline. At least eight homes
have been destroyed and Pacific Coast Highway has been rerouted five
times, Young says.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we have a big El Nino year, something moves," Young
says. "Recently, [the bluffs] haven't slid, but it's purely because
nature hasn't reared its ugly head."</TE>
<TE>   Slide stories abound. One of the worst involves the precipitous
bluff directly under Via de Las Olas. Tons of earth came down and
blocked a 200-yard section of Pacific Coast Highway in 1958. A long
cleanup job was followed by an inspection by Vaughn O. Sheff, highway
superintendent for the California Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Local lore--based partly on old newspaper accounts--has it that
Sheff declared the road fit to reopen just before a new slide came
down. Sheff desperately ran for the beach but stumbled and fell. His
crumpled body was exhumed after seven hours of digging.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of the Palisades," says Young, "is a history of land
movement.... [But] one reason the Palisades is so charming is because
of these slopes. You have to live with the good and bad. It's the yin
and yang of the Palisades."</TE>
<TE>   Those who choose these breathtaking ocean views willingly take a
gamble, as Androsky did soon after the slide that killed Sheff. In
four decades, Androsky says, he has seen erosion remove 1 1/2 feet of
bluff on the seaward side of the street--an area with no homes. The
rail fence is angled in places to accommodate small slide zones.</TE>
<TE>   Further slides are always a concern, he says, but the current rate
of erosion figures to give him a few thousand years before his own
home tumbles over the edge.</TE>
<TE>   This night, the sunset seems to justify that risk. The thin band
along the horizon is topped by an island of denser, scalloped clouds.
Those turn from gray to fiery gold as the sun drops below them. A low
mist--well beneath the bluff top--begins to drift over the highway as
far north as Point Dume.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Geiger, a 44-year-old Web page designer, has stopped by. His
first moments on the cliff are enough to alter his conception of the
coast.</TE>
<TE>   "What I love about living in Los Angeles," he says, "is that you
can create your own version of the city ... unlike New York, which
has landmarks to define the place."</TE>
<TE>   Headlights fill the highway. Lights wink on in the canyons. The
sea darkens as the sun finally disappears, creating a new illusion of
brilliance in the sky. It is streaked with pale blue and orange.</TE>
<TE>   A good sunset lingers well after the sun itself is gone, notes Pat
Murphy, 44. "It's the artwork of the clouds," he says, ever-changing
yet enduring.</TE>
<TE>   "I think about, 'What would this have been like 3,000 years ago
... to sit on [this] bluff?' " he says. "You almost feel like you
could be at any time in history."</TE>

<HD>New 'Gigger' Worm Spreading Slowly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new computer worm masquerading as a software update from Microsoft
Corp. is capable of deleting all files on the hard drive of an
infected computer but has so far spread slowly, an anti-virus vendor
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Gigger worm is a low threat since so few computers
have been infected, said Vincent Gullotto, senior research director
for Network Associates Inc.'s Antivirus Response Team.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a mass-mailer with a dangerous payload, but it's not in the
wild," he said. "If it was to begin to spread it could cause
significant problems."</LD>
<TE>   Few people apparently have been duped into opening the attachment,
and that has limited the spread of the worm, Gullotto said.</TE>
<TE>   The worm, a self-propagating virus, is written in Java script and
uses Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express and MIRC Internet Relay Chat
channels to spread.</TE>
<TE>   Gigger arrives as an attachment to an e-mail that has a subject
line of "Outlook Express Update." The worm sends itself to addresses
in the address book and tries to delete all files on the hard drive,
Gullotto said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. and Steelcase Inc., the biggest office furniture maker,
have teamed to develop a cubicle that uses sensors and wireless
devices to make sharing information more effective.</LD>
<LD>   The partially open desk area, called BlueSpace, allows users to
control their lighting, heat and privacy. Information projected onto
walls, desktops or floors can be changed with a finger used like a
cursor.</LD>
<LD>   After an 18-month research alliance, the two companies will test
the modular system with potential buyers.</LD>
<TE>   The display system works with a ceiling projector that casts an
image of the computer screen on a wall or desktop. A camera near the
projector tracks a person's gestures and captures shadows from a
pointed finger so that gesture-recognition software can let a finger
substitute for a mouse-controlled cursor.</TE>
<TE>   Personal comfort and privacy also are goals. A touch screen beside
an employee's computer can be used to control task lighting, airflow
or temperature. Workers could direct heat to cold feet, for example.</TE>
<TE>   A movable wall would use muted color-coded lighting near the
ceiling to indicate when a worker is away, busy or accepting
visitors. A separate panel display on the outside of the wall would
let the worker post messages when away.</TE>

<HD>Wizard With a Web Site</HD>
<DH>Acclaimed British actor Ian McKellen keeps his fans
informed online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ian McKellen stars as the wizard Gandalf the Grey in the massive film
adaptation of "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." On
stage, he just finished a limited Broadway run in a new translation
of August Strindberg's "Dance of Death" opposite Helen Mirren.</LD>
<LD>   Knighted in his native England in 1989, McKellen has a long list
of highly prestigious movie credits, including the title role in his
own adaptation of "Richard III" and as director James Whale in "Gods
and Monsters." But he has not shied away from pop culture projects,
playing Magneto in "X-Men" (a role he'll reprise in the sequel) and
the Chairman in Sidney Sheldon's "Windmills of the Gods."</LD>
<LD>   He won a best actor Tony award in 1981 for his role as Antonio
Salieri in "Amadeus," and to local stages he has brought his one-man
shows "Acting Shakespeare" and "A Knight Out" that presented excerpts
from plays and literature concerning gay issues.</LD>
<TE>   McKellen, 62, lives in London and has a Web site
(www.mckellen.com), that includes his commentary on dozens of his
roles.</TE>
<TE>   DESKTOP: I don't know, but I'm the kind of guy who can't tell you
what kind of car I drive. I know it's a Macintosh, a G4 that has a
lovely screen that shows DVDs, not that I've done that yet. I got it
on the suggestion of the Webmaster of my site, Keith Stern.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why did he suggest you get a Mac?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I think it was because of the aesthetics of the thing. I
don't think I'm untypical in that I don't have much of a sense of how
these machines work. I just use them.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When did you get your first computer?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was about six years ago when I was writing the screenplay
for "Richard III." Before that I was using a Brother word processor
that showed about three lines of text on a tiny screen--when it was
on the screen you could make changes, but thereafter it was fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The computer I got was an Amstrad (an English PC maker) on the
advice of the film's director, Richard Loncraine. He had the same
computer, so it was easy to pass material back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   LAPTOP: The metallic one (Titanium PowerBook). It's lovely and I
have not spilled any wine into it, which is what happened to the last
one. It got drunk. I pressed a key on it and it typed about 200 "t"s.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You use it for e-mail when you are traveling?</TE>
<TE>   A: Almost exclusively. Every day Keith sends me a batch of e-mail
that came into the Web site. To some of them I give answers that are
posted on the site. I don't on the whole do personal replies. Maybe
on a gay issue, if someone is confiding something about their own
lives and asking for my comments or help, perhaps about coming out.
Also, sometimes an actor who is preparing for a part might want my
views.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did the Web site get started?</TE>
<TE>   A: When I was doing "A Knight Out" in Los Angeles four years ago,
Keith did a little page to publicize it. He asked if I would be
interested in having a site.</TE>
<TE>   The idea interested me because I didn't want to write a biography.
I thought it would take too long and the trouble with them is that
they finish but the life carries on. The beauty of having something
online is that it can be updated.</TE>
<TE>   When we started, I was just going to put up some information on my
roles and some photographs. But once people started writing and I
started replying, the site got taken over in an exciting way by the
people who were going to it and sending e-mails. It was truly
interactive.</TE>
<TE>   The first week in January, the site got 21/4 million hits because
of "Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Q: You pay to have the Webmaster manage the site?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. He handles them for other actors too. I have approval over
the look of it, the type used and the content, of course. We sell a
few things on the site, such as T-shirts, that go toward paying for
it.</TE>
<TE>   HAND-HELD: No Palm or anything like that. I would just lose it.</TE>
<TE>   BOOKMARKS: I've got my favorites, but it's not a long list. I love
reading the British press online when I am away--the Guardian
Unlimited (www. guardian.co.uk), the Observer (www. observer.co.uk)
and also the BBC (news.bbc.co.uk).</TE>
<TE>   I look at the Drudge Report (www.drudgereport.com) and post-9/11 I
go to the ZNet site (www.lbbs.org). It's from Z magazine and has
commentaries from Noam Chomsky and Australian John Pilger, who wages
war against capitalism and globalization. It has points of view you
might not read in the American press.</TE>
<TE>   CELL PHONE: I see the point of them and I do have one, but I don't
think anyone has the number. I very occasionally make calls out.</TE>
<TE>   I have a temperamental disaffection with cell phones. When I see
someone coming down the street on the phone, I always take it
personally. Don't they want to be outside, don't they want the
possibility of running into someone--not necessarily me, but someone?
Don't they want to be open to serendipity, to having an adventure?</TE>
<TE>   No. Apparently they would rather be with the person they are
talking to. Well, the whole world can't be in love.</TE>
<TE>   If you can carry the office with you, why bother to go out? When I
go out I am looking forward to the journey. I don't want to be doing
something I could be doing at my desk at home.</TE>

<HD>Winter Sports So Hot, They're Cool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT BURNS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, you can be old school and snowboard this winter. You can even
take the folks and go skiing. But to be really on the edge, check out
some of the sports the Ministry of Weird Things to Do on Snow and Ice
has come up with.</LD>
<LD>   First, there's skeleton, which is making a comeback at the Winter
Olympics this year. Think going down a luge chute at up to 80 miles
per hour on the "bones" of a bob sled, headfirst. For a first-hand
experience, check out GORP
(www.gorp.com/gorp/location/ut/sleddin2.htm). Face dragging is
evidently a concern. National Geographic has covered the sport, too,
at news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/02/0228crestarun.html, but
then we're used to seeing stuff about ritual scarification in that
magazine.</LD>
<LD>   And while we're on Olympic sports, there's the biathlon, because
what couldn't be great about cross-country skiing and target
practice? The Winter Olympic site
(www.saltlake2002.com/x/f/frame.htm?u=http%3A//www.saltlake2002.com/a
ts/bt/bt_index.html&amp;s=sloc) has a good description. (You can also
just go to www.saltlake2002.com and navigate your way from there.)</LD>
<TE>   Maybe you'd prefer a sport that doesn't involve guns. How about
bandy? According to the American Bandy Assn. (www.americanbandy.com),
"It is best described as field hockey on skates." Ice hockey, on the
other hand, is best described as bandy, only more popular. The site
says "Cave paintings in Egypt suggest that a game similar to bandy
was being played there 4,000 years ago." Yeah, when the Nile freezes
over.</TE>
<TE>   You might be reluctant to ask a team-full of people if they want
to bandy. For skijor, though, you need only a reindeer, dog, horse or
possibly a friend with low self-esteem to pull you around on skis.
The North American Ski Joring Assn. (www.nasja.com/whatis.htm) seems
to prefer horses but the Midwest Skijorers
(www.skijor.org/midwest/index.html) features dogs, as does the North
American Skijoring and Ski Pulk Assn.
(www.ptialaska.net/~skijor). But then, they don't agree on
whether "skijor" is one word or two, either.</TE>
<TE>   Allergic to fur and none of your friends are willing to mush? Try
ski-biking, which is best described as biking on snow, but not. The
American Ski-Bike Assn. (www.skibike.org) says ski-biking originated
almost 150 years ago and the Czech Republic even has a stamp
commemorating the sport. But perhaps a Swiss ski-biker's site
(www.snowbike.ch/englisch_information.htm) sums it up best with:
"Snowbike is a sport for the devils." Take that, snowboarders.</TE>
<TE>   Not every winter sport is about competition and speed. Peace and
quiet and cardio are not mutually exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Take snowshoeing, which is best described as hiking with tennis
rackets. Snowshoers, like their sport, are a quiet bunch with not a
lot on the Net. HikerCentral.com (www.hikercentral.com/snowshoe) has
some links, as does Arte Outdoors
(www.aretecommunity.com/channel.html?rq_category=/snow/ snowshoeing).</TE>
<TE>   If you want to hang out, there's ice climbing, described as rock
climbing on frozen water. Ice climbers are much more wired than
snowshoers. Rock &amp; Ice (www.rockandice.com/index.phtml?section=ice)
has current conditions and SierraClimbers.com
(www.sierraclimbers.com) features a climb in Lee Vining Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   If all this winter activity makes you want to curl up in front of
the air conditioner, try RSN's cam network (www.rsn.com/cams) that
covers many mountain resorts. Voyeurism is never out of season.</TE>

<DH>Park fliers have trimmed model airplaning's expenditures of
time and money, but not the fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in the days of "Leave it to Beaver," dad and lad could be found
bonding not only their relationship but also pieces of balsa wood
into radio-controlled model airplanes. After weeks or even months of
work, they would emerge from the garage workshop and head for the
park with a gas-powered flying machine that would cause everyone in
the neighborhood to exclaim, "Gee."</LD>
<LD>   Times have changed.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have the traditional two-parent family and garage full
of tools that dad used in his free time to show everyone on the
street how to make an airplane," said Glenn Merritt, director of
marketing for Hitec RCD, which makes a wide variety of
radio-controlled airplane products. "Now you have a single mom
supporting two kids, living in a condo or apartment. They don't have
the space or resources to do the traditional kind of modeling.</LD>
<TE>   "We live in an age of instant gratification," Merritt said, which
calls for a new kind of model airplane if the endeavor is to survive.
Over the last couple of years, advances in technology, clever
engineering and mass manufacturing in Asia have provided a possible
answer: the park flier.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike gas-powered models, which can cost a beginner about $400
for a "trainer" airplane and other necessary equipment, a park flier
costs about $100 for an all-inclusive package.</TE>
<TE>   Several will be on display this weekend at the Pasadena Convention
Center during the country's largest model airplane convention and
trade show, sponsored by the Academy of Model Aeronautics (www.model
aircraft.org).</TE>
<TE>   A park flier can be snapped together and readied for its first
flight the same afternoon the box is opened. And instead of using
gas, it is powered by much cleaner, rechargeable batteries.</TE>
<TE>   There are drawbacks. The park fliers generally are far more
limited in speed, acrobatic ability and length of flight than even
the most basic gas models. And to put it diplomatically, when
compared with the traditional balsa wood planes, they have nice
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "The aesthetics are not exactly as satisfying," said Greg Horwitz,
longtime member of the San Fernando Valley Radio Control Flyers
(valleyflyers.usinter.net), which operates a flying field in the
Sepulveda Basin that is world famous among those in the model
airplane scene.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday, the dozens of aircraft soaring above the field
included meticulous reproductions of planes ranging from a military
Bearcat to the general aviation Piper Cub. There were several
helicopters and even a couple of sleek turbine-jet models capable of
reaching speeds close to 200 mph (just the engine on a model turbine
costs more than $3,000).</TE>
<TE>   But if the bare-bones park fliers bring young people--who are far
more likely to play a video game than be enchanted by airplane
models--to the Flyers or any of the other 2,500 model airplane clubs
in the country, their aesthetics probably will be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first joined the club 31 year ago," said George Finch, a
past president of the Flyers, "I was the median age.</TE>
<TE>   "I still am."</TE>
<TE>   Among the advances that led to the development of park fliers was
the strengthening of lightweight foam that could be used instead of
balsa. Not only did the foam allow for a model design that could be
mass manufactured and quickly assembled, it also made repairs much
simpler.</TE>
<TE>   "Wood planes don't rebound; they break up pretty good. And there
is no way to learn how to fly without doing some crashing," said
Steven Goodreau, spokesman for Horizon Hobby, which makes the
Firebird line of park fliers.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage to foam planes tends not to be as critical, and it can
be more easily repaired."</TE>
<TE>   The electric engines and radio receivers built into park fliers
also are lightweight.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at one of these things and you can't help but be
impressed with how small the components have gotten," said Jim
Pearson, who has been flying models since 1961 and is assistant
editor of RC Modeler magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "They make it possible to build a plane that can be flown in an
area much smaller than what used to be needed."</TE>
<TE>   But can a completely inexperienced klutz assemble and fly a park
flier?</TE>
<TE>   The first one we tried was the Wattage Lightning EP (Global Hobby
Distributors, $80), a dual-propeller model that is small and
lightweight even by park flier standards.</TE>
<TE>   It took my buddy Henry and me only 16 minutes to assemble the
plane, following the clearly illustrated instructions and using the
enclosed screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   Quality control was not the model's strong point. One of the
propellers was missing its cone assembly, but a couple of spares were
included.</TE>
<TE>   The on-board battery allows for only a few minutes of flight time
before recharging. But the recharging can be done in the field,
because the transmitter doubles as the battery charger.</TE>
<TE>   We took the plane to a nearby softball field and Henry, who was my
guest, got to try it first. Following instructions in the booklet, he
gently tossed it into the air. The Lightning flew from the beginning,
although it pulled strongly to the left. Still, he brought it down
for an almost picture-perfect landing on the pitcher's mound.</TE>
<TE>   It was to be the last successful Lightning flight. The pulling got
worse, to the point where after one launch it quickly circled around
and came right at us, earning the nickname, "Cujo the Airplane."</TE>
<TE>   A couple of flights later, Henry drilled it into the ground,
breaking off a wing. Next stop, the hardware store for five-minute
glue.</TE>
<TE>   The Sky Scooter (Hitec RDC, $149) was a larger, heavier and more
complex model. It also came with directions that were daunting for a
novice (sample: "Adjust clevis so that the elevator is level with the
horizontal stabilizer"), especially because the illustrations often
were unedifying. We finally had it together in an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Maximum flying time is four minutes on a charge, according to the
manual. Then the batteries can be recharged using an automobile
battery, a process that takes 15 minutes. Every toss led to a short
glide. Then it headed downward, seemingly not noticing it had a
whirling propeller. Finally, after several tosses, it hit the ground
hard and the engine started making an unhealthy grinding noise.</TE>
<TE>   The most success, by far, came with the Firebird II (Horizon
Hobby, $100), a lightweight pusher, meaning its propeller is at the
rear of the wing. We had it assembled in 18 minutes, in large part
because of a quite helpful instructional video that comes with the
kit. The video went on to show the basics of how to fly the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Out on the field, several practice launches went just as shown on
the tape. On about the fifth powered launch, the Firebird suddenly
nosed up and climbed into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   On the east side of field there was only one tree. Our little
plane went at it like a heat-seeking missile.</TE>
<TE>   "The plane hit the tree and got stuck," announced one of the
children, a Vin Scully in training. Then they all watched the
middle-aged man climb to the top of the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "He is going to fall and get hurt," predicted little Vin. But we
finally got the plane, and its total damage amounted to a chip out of
a wing.</TE>
<TE>   The next flight was glorious, as we got the Firebird to climb at
least 100 feet, do some lazy figure eights and then, after about 10
minutes in the air, circle down slowly to a soft landing. Even the
kids applauded.</TE>
<TE>   Several days later at the Flyers field, the three park fliers were
put through their paces by Finch, who had them all up and dancing
with little effort. It was eye-opening to see what an experienced
model pilot could do with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Flying instructions are the key to being able to enjoy this
sport. We offer it at no charge to anyone who comes out to our
field," Horwitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Finch and Horwitz hope that park fliers lead young people to more
advanced model airplaning, although they could not recall an instance
of it happening, yet.</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters they have managed to get to the field for hands-on
demonstrations have proved to be quick learners. "I am amazed at how
fast they pick it up; it's like they have an instinct for it," Finch
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's because of the video games."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sports games take wildly divergent paths.</LD>
<LD>   One track is the over-the-top genre in which the fun lies in
defying the rules or tweaking the laws of physics.</LD>
<LD>   The other is the ultra-faithful, eerily realistic sports game, in
which player characteristics are simulated with such painstaking
detail that it becomes difficult at a distance to tell the difference
between the video game and a live television broadcast.</LD>
<TE>   The two philosophies are best represented by "NFL Blitz" on the
one hand and "NFL2K" or "Madden Football" on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Published by Midway Games Inc., "NFL Blitz" is a no-holds-barred
football game whose principle feature is mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Sega's "NFL2K" and Electronic Arts Inc.'s "Madden" series evolved
into pure simulations, emphasizing visual fidelity, individual
players that act much like their real-world counterparts and teams
with the same strengths and weaknesses as the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling this off requires more than just slavish attention and
brute force, said Greg Thomas, 34, president of Visual Concepts.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas began making sports games in 1994, when his San Rafael,
Calif., studio converted EA's "Madden 94" for the Nintendo Super NES
console.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Visual Concepts built its own football game from the
ground up. The result was "NFL2K," a marquee title for Sega's
now-defunct Dreamcast console.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Visual Concepts makes sports games for all consoles,
including Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 2.</TE>
<TE>   Question: A number of companies have made a run at sports games,
but few have succeeded. What's so hard about this genre?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Consumers of this genre are the most finicky. They want
the game to look like it looks on TV. As you give them more, they
want more. It's the most difficult sport to make happen on a computer
because it's about delivering true-to-life simulation.</TE>
<TE>   We make sure every single position has as many behaviors as there
are in the real world. We record every single NFL game. We have tapes
of nothing but individual plays. We model the behaviors in as many
ways as we can.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What goals do you have in mind when you set out to make these
games?</TE>
<TE>   A: Our goal is to make a sport happen in a video game the same way
it happens in real life.</TE>
<TE>   For football, we will record every single game that's played. We
have someone here whose sole job it is to take every single screen
pass and put it on a tape. Same with running plays, pitches, bombs,
outs, streaks. Whatever. And we will do that for every player in the
NFL.</TE>
<TE>   We have upward of 200 tapes, each about 40 minutes. They'll be
labeled sweep play to the right, punt, punt blocks, and so on. Our
programmers will sit there and look at every play. We want to make
our players look and play like their human counterparts. We'll have
their strength and speed, but we'll also put in special attributes
that key people will have. Barry Sanders can cut on a dime. Peyton
Manning has a signature play-action pass.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Give me an example in another sport.</TE>
<TE>   A: In basketball, players have signature motions at the free-throw
line. Karl Malone is famous for saying one of his daughter's name
just before he throws the ball. We do that in our game. Each player
has a different free-throw routine. We capture all of that. That's
the stuff that makes a big difference.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Visual goals?</TE>
<TE>   A: Visually, we have artists who have photo references for every
player in the league. We'll narrow the cheekbones, raise eyebrows,
draw in the goatees. It's a detail people don't necessarily notice,
but it sets the game apart.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Sports games, football in particular, can be intimidating. How
do you make a game that anybody can pick up and play?</TE>
<TE>   A: Consumers want to believe that they are the master of their
sport. They want to be the greatest shooting guard of the NBA, but
they're not. If we made the game that difficult, they wouldn't be
able to play.</TE>
<TE>   So we have [artificial intelligence programs] assisting. It'll
assist them in making the right decisions.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers still will feel like they have complete control, and
yet we're helping them. We'll point people subtly in the right
direction. We'll make sure the players around them will be doing the
best thing for the player to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, these things are still entertainment, not
chores. People have enough chores throughout their lives.</TE>

<DH>Computer or TV: Which will be the platform of choice for
navigating the entertainment frontier?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Kendig, a computer consultant in Orlando, Fla., connected a
computer to his TV set in the mid-1990s because he wanted a bigger
screen for his computer video games.</LD>
<LD>   "It worked, but the quality wasn't there," Kendig said.
Nevertheless, he still has an Apple Macintosh hooked to his TV so he
can surf the Web and play MP3 files in his living room.</LD>
<LD>   The computer industry looks at consumers like Kendig and licks its
chops. With sales of desktops in the dumpster, manufacturers are
hoping to carve out expansive new roles for computers in
entertainment and home automation--roles that prod the public to buy
another PC.</LD>
<TE>   In particular, companies such as Microsoft envision the computer
as the hub of the new digital home, directing audio and video streams
from room to room and pulling in new material from the Web.</TE>
<TE>   At the recent International Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas, Microsoft showed off new software that lets consumers play or
display the audio, video and pictures on their computers with a
simple remote control. It also demonstrated technology that would let
consumers tote flat, touch-screen monitors around their homes while
maintaining a wireless connection to their PC.</TE>
<TE>   Other computer companies are developing entertainment-oriented
products too, and not always with Microsoft. Hewlett-Packard, for
example, has built a digital music center with Microsoft rival
RealNetworks, while Compaq is working on a line of interconnected
audio and video gear with Mediabolic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, another camp is emerging that wants to minimize the
role played by personal computers. These consumer electronics
companies are building TV set-top boxes that bring the networking
smarts and storage capacity of computers to the living room, but not
the Windows (or Apple) operating system.</TE>
<TE>   Examples on display at the Consumer Electronics Show included a
next-generation personal TV recorder by TiVo that captures music,
video and games from the Web, and a forthcoming Digital Library from
Pioneer and Mediabolic that will store and transmit digital audio,
video, photos and Web-based media.</TE>
<TE>   These products represent the first salvos fired in the war to come
over the wired home. The battle lines are loosely drawn, but the
central dividing line is whether the computer or the TV will rule
over the digital domain.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely a long, long fight ahead," said Gary Arlen, a
media and consumer electronics consultant.</TE>
<TE>   At stake for consumers is the development of easy-to-use products
and services that enable people to enjoy video, music and the
Internet anywhere in their homes. The more intense the competition,
the faster new, innovative and potentially conflicting approaches
will come to the market.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the threat is incompatibility," Arlen said. "And
increasingly, that is keeping people away from the business."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Walker of Lumenati, a Bay Area software company that
specializes in online services, sees a multibillion-dollar market for
digital home devices. But before that market can take off, he said,
companies must answer a fundamental question: What do consumers
really want?</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of technologies you can throw at consumers, but
what's going to stick?" asked Walker, Lumenati's vice president of
products and technology.</TE>
<TE>   Kendig, for one, doesn't find the idea of having a computer
control his home entertainment universe very appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the case of a PC trying to be something it's not," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of reluctance is typical among consumers, yet it may be
easy to overcome, Arlen said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you call it a PC and it looks like a desktop PC, it's not a
device that consumers want for entertainment," he said. "Make it
silver, make it a cube, and it's a home controller. It's an
entertainment controller.''</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, Microsoft's efforts in the home entertainment
field have produced mixed results. Its WebTV set-top box, which
brought the Internet to TV screens, stumbled badly after signing up
its first million customers, and its successor, UltimateTV, which
added digital video recording to Web surfing, is off to a slow start.
But sales of its Xbox game console have been strong since its debut
in November.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has some important allies, including Charter
Communications and Samsung. But there are some powerful forces in the
TV-centric camp, including AOL Time Warner and Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Fujio Nishida, president and chief operating officer of Sony
Electronics, said his company sees computers as a part of the home
network, but not an essential part. Instead, Sony is taking a
"PC-free" approach, creating devices that can connect to each other
and the Internet without the intervention of a computer.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest obstacle to the digital home today may be how
difficult it is for even experts to connect home electronics into a
network. "Unless and until you can solve those problems," Walker
said, "the concept of these devices in different rooms talking to
each other clearly is not going to work."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owning a digital camera means never having to buy another roll of
film.</LD>
<LD>   But if you plan to pass around those digital pictures, you'll
probably have to stock up on unusually expensive paper and ink.</LD>
<LD>   Tech Times recently tested four small printers dedicated to
digital photos, all of which work without the aid of a computer. The
printers read images either directly from the camera or from the
camera's removable storage card.</LD>
<TE>   Three of the models--the Canon CP-10, the Sony DPP-SV55 and the
Olympus Camedia P-200--use dye sublimation, the same technique found
in professional-grade printers. The other--the Hewlett-Packard
Photosmart 100--is a more conventional ink-jet printer.</TE>
<TE>   The models vary dramatically in price, print size, editing
functions and costs per print. Yet they all were a breeze to use, and
each produced prints comparable in quality to the local one-hour
photo lab. All provided near-instant gratification, churning out
prints in 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the immediacy of the results, though, none of the printers
offered a compelling reason to use it instead of an all-purpose
computer printer or an online photo-processing service. Each photo
cost as much as $1.20, with no discounts for double prints.</TE>
<TE>   HP's Photosmart 100 was the most affordable, with prints costing
around 40 cents each. Still, the only real advantage the HP seems to
provide over computer printers with photo-printing software is that
it can be placed anywhere in the house, rather than being tethered to
the PC.</TE>
<TE>   Dye-sublimation printing is a bit like ironing a design onto a
T-shirt. The printer uses an array of tiny heaters to press dots of
color onto the photo paper.</TE>
<TE>   The process starts with a roll of thin plastic film that's
embedded with cyan, magenta and yellow dye. Before each image is
printed, a new section of film lines up between the heating elements
and the surface of the photo paper.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of heat emitted by each tiny element determines how
much dye gets vaporized and deposited onto the print. The paper
slides back and forth within the printer four times--once for each
pigment, and once for a final coat of transparent sealer that blocks
ultraviolet rays.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a smooth, well-defined image. And thanks to the
UV-resistant coating, the prints should resist fading for 25 years or
more--the same as those printed by a professional lab, said Chuck
Westfall, an assistant director for technical information at Canon
USA Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Ink-jet printers, by contrast, are more like pointillist painters.
They spray droplets of liquid ink onto the photo paper one thin line
at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The HP Photosmart 100 starts with a container of cyan, magenta and
yellow ink. As paper passes through the printer, the ink cartridge
slides back and forth, releasing a line of tiny drops of color. On
photo paper designed for ink-jet printers, the ink will seep below
the glossy surface to resist smudging and prolong life.</TE>
<TE>   Still, HP says the Photosmart's prints may start to fade after
four to 51/2 years. Other disadvantages of ink-jet printers generally
are that they're slower than dye-sublimation models and their images
tend to have softer edges.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the array of thousands of heating elements in
dye-sublimation printers boosts their cost significantly over ink-jet
models. And the dye-infused ribbons are much more expensive than ink
cartridges, so the prints are more costly as well.</TE>
<TE>   Canon CP-10</TE>
<TE>   The $300 CP-10 works only with four Canon digital cameras (the
A10, A20, S110 and S300), and its largest prints are the size of a
business card (2.1 by 3.4 inches). Those limitations make the CP-10
the wrong printer for most consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The size of a boxy camera, the CP-10 sets up quickly and easily. A
special wire connects the printer to a Canon camera's USB port, and
all the operations are controlled from the camera's menu and LCD
screen. It takes seconds to select and crop images and even less time
to send a newly snapped photo straight to the printer.</TE>
<TE>   Each print takes less than a minute to process, rivaling a
Polaroid's speed from shutter to paper. And with the sticker option,
users can print eight postage-stamp-size versions of an image on an
adhesive-backed sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The prints themselves were the brightest of the models tested and
had the highest contrast. But they also had the least vivid hues,
resulting in paler skin tones and darker reds and blues. The model is
rated at 300 dots per inch, with 256 shades per color.</TE>
<TE>   Canon sells its proprietary ink ribbons with packages of paper,
with each ribbon capable of printing only the sheets provided in the
pack. The most economical option is 36 sheets for $17.50, which
amounts to a little less than 50 cents per print.</TE>
<TE>   For larger images and wider compatibility, Canon offers the $500
Canon CD-300, which can print 4-by-6-inch and 4-by-10-inch images
from any camera.</TE>
<TE>   Olympus Camedia P-200</TE>
<TE>   Olympus' entry-level dye-sublimation printer, the P-200, lists for
$599 but can be found online for $350 to $400. It handles only one
size of paper--4 by 3 inches--which can be used for one to 16 images.</TE>
<TE>   The size of a compact dictionary, the P-200 can print images
directly from a SmartMedia or CompactFlash card, or with an optional
USB or parallel cable, from a computer. With the optional
rechargeable battery (list price: $100), you can take the P-200 with
you to make prints on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The printer can read the Digital Print Order Format (DPOF), which
most digital cameras use to tag images on a storage card for
printing. Otherwise, controls on the printer let users select an
image or sequence of images to print. Users must select images by
number because the P-200's small monochrome display can't show the
images themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The printer doesn't offer any mode for cropping images. The only
way it can alter picture quality is through a sharpness button, which
subtly increases or decreases the crispness of the image.</TE>
<TE>   The images tended to be lighter than the Canon's but darker than
those of the other units tested, with deeper blues. The printer was
relatively fast, churning out photos in about 90 seconds. The model
is rated at 320 dots per inch, with 128 shades per color.</TE>
<TE>   Olympus sells packs with 25 sheets of photo paper and a dye ribbon
for a little under $30, which translates to $1.20 per print.</TE>
<TE>   Sony DPP-SV55</TE>
<TE>   The largest and most feature-packed of the printers tested, the
$350 DPP-SV55 can edit as well as print photos. Like all Sony digital
products, it's designed to work most easily with Memory Stick storage
cards--the version of flash memory Sony developed. But it also has a
slot for PC cards, so it can accept other forms of flash memory with
a PC card adapter.</TE>
<TE>   The size of a three-ring binder, the DPP-SV55 is a bit daunting to
use with a computer but extremely easy with a TV set. The TV serves
as a monitor, displaying menus and images to help users choose which
photos to print and what effects to apply. The Sony also supports
DPOF, eliminating the need for a TV to do basic printing jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The DPP-SV55's paper tray can handle two different sizes: 4 by 6
inches and 3 1/2 by 4 inches. The larger sheets take about 90 seconds
to print, the smaller ones a little less. Each sheet can be split
into four, nine or 16 images.</TE>
<TE>   The built-in editing tools include cropping and enlarging;
adjusting the brightness, color and sharpness; and adding a few
simple filters. The unit also offers a handful of templates for
personalized postcards, calendars or stickers, and the cards can be
further customized with text.</TE>
<TE>   The editing tools came in handy because Sony's prints were the
most deeply saturated in color. Skin tones were ruddier and hues were
more intense than any other units', and contrast tended to be lower.
The model is rated at 403 dots per inch, with 256 shades per color.</TE>
<TE>   Sony sells packages of 25 4-by-6-inch sheets with a dye ribbon for
$20, or 80 cents per sheet. It also sells 30 sheets of the smaller
paper with a dye ribbon for $15, or 50 cents per sheet.</TE>
<TE>   HP Photosmart 100</TE>
<TE>   Bearing an uncanny resemblance to a countertop radio, the $179
Photosmart 100 prints 4-by-6-inch, wallet-size (2 1/2-by-3 1/4-inch)
or thumbnail images on glossy photo sheets, index cards or even plain
paper.</TE>
<TE>   The unit was the most widely compatible of the models testing,
with slots for CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MemoryStick cards as well
as a USB port for connecting to a computer.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Olympus P-200, the Photosmart has a small screen that
displays only numbers and icons. It can't display which images are on
the inserted storage cards, so users have to select images for
printing by number.</TE>
<TE>   The unit also lets people use the screens on their cameras to pick
which images they want to print.</TE>
<TE>   The Photosmart is low on features, with no ability to crop or
adjust images. It's also significantly slower than the other units
tested, taking about 2 minutes and 50 seconds per photo.</TE>
<TE>   The prints were brighter, crisper and less green than the other
models' photos. Although the results seemed washed out at times, the
Photosmart did a better job than the other units in keeping white
objects white. It's rated at up to 2,400 by 1,200 dots per inch, but
the difference in printing techniques makes it misleading to compare
an ink jet's rating to a dye-sublimation model's.</TE>
<TE>   The Photosmart uses a specific ink cartridge made only by HP,
which costs $35 for up to 391 photos, depending on the color density.
But the unit can handle most manufacturers' 4-by-6-inch photo paper.
If you stick with HP premium paper, the cost per print is about 42
cents.</TE>

<HD>Do We Really Need a Shrinky Dinks Maker?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents probably remember the 1970s fad of cutting out plastic
shapes, coloring them and shrinking the crafts in the oven. In a bid
to revive the trend, Canadian-based Spin Master Toys recently
released its "child-safe" Incredible Shrinky Dinks Maker.</LD>
<LD>   For about $30, the toy comes with the "oven," three sheets of the
shrinkable plastic, three colored pencils, three key chains, a
magnetic strip (for making refrigerator magnets), two shrink trays
and traceable images.</LD>
<LD>   First, the good stuff: Shrinky Dinks rock.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the bad: Not included is a 60-watt round clear candelabra
base light bulb, which can be a pain to find at the local grocery
store. Buy the wrong light bulb and the dinks won't shrink.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the days of old, kids must trace the images, instead of
cutting out pre-made designs and tweaking the colors as they see fit.
Though this is a bonus to anyone with a creative slant, the
artistically impaired might find the additional step a bit trying.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if this device is supposed to be just for kids, then why
does a huge warning on the cover of the box scream "Parental
Supervision Recommended," and the see-through window on the oven say
"Hot: Do Not Touch"?</TE>
<TE>   Why not just pick up the refill kits, for about $6, and make them
in a regular oven?</TE>

<HD>Plenty of Large-Scale Combat in 'Lineage,' but Pace Really
Drags</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENN GOLD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lineage: The Blood Pledge" is one of the most popular online games
in the world, although most people in the United States have never
heard of it.</LD>
<LD>   It was created in Korea three years ago and has a following in the
Far East that towers over the worldwide role-playing populations of
such behemoths as "Ultima Online" and "EverQuest."</LD>
<LD>   Now, "Lineage" (www.lineage thebloodpledge.com) has come to these
shores through a landmark deal with gaming god Richard Garriott,
creator of the "Ultima" franchise.</LD>
<TE>   All I can say is he shouldn't have wasted his time. Why Garriott,
one of the most respected names in interactive entertainment, would
attach his name to this game is unfathomable.</TE>
<TE>   This teen-rated game for PCs is so slow, old and boring that you
will wonder if you have entered some sort of gamer's twilight zone
where everyone is role-playing people with 9,600-baud modems.</TE>
<TE>   The chance of this game succeeding with U.S. gamers is even more
remote given the game's $15-a-month subscription fee--a premium
compared with the $10 a month most of its competitors charge.</TE>
<TE>   The story behind "Lineage: The Blood Pledge" is something to do
with kings and princes and killing other players to control castles
and dominate the realm. The developers haven't put much effort into
developing a coherent story.</TE>
<TE>   To begin your life in "Lineage," you select one of four classes:
knight, wizard, elf or prince/princess. The classes are rather
stereotypical. The knight is a pure warrior, the wizard is your usual
magic caster, the elf is primarily an archer and the prince/princess
is sort of a hybrid warrior/magic user.</TE>
<TE>   Once you have selected your character, you enter the newbie town
to embark on your journey to fame and fortune. This seems to be
accomplished by dying a lot.</TE>
<TE>   At level one, you can barely kill anything. The solution is to
find a training dummy, click and hold for 12 minutes. All of a sudden
you are level four. I'm not sure why they even have levels one to
three.</TE>
<TE>   Once you are level four, you are ready to go out and kill some
basic orcs and wolves. Despite your greater abilities, the game is
still brutal to new players. Expect to die some more.</TE>
<TE>   What is a real throwback is the slowness of the game. At first, I
thought I had either some major lag, or a bad connection to the game
servers. As I continued to play, I realized this game is just
slow-paced. Moving your character through the world feels like you
are walking though molasses.</TE>
<TE>   The game interface is simple enough. Click on a spot and you start
to move toward it; click on a monster and you attack it.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the interface is sometimes too simple. Many little
things that are important to role players are missing, like the
ability to click on a piece of equipment to see its statistics. To
find out if the sword you just picked up from a dead Death Knight is
any good, you have to go to the "Lineage" Web site.</TE>
<TE>   From a graphics standpoint, "Lineage" seems almost older than it
is. The colors are washed out and dull. In addition, there is a lack
of individuality in the game. With only eight types of characters (a
male and female version of each of the four classes), you often feel
like you are part of a weirdly chaotic cattle drive.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of this game is not playing against the environment, but
fighting other players. In this area, the game delivers what it
promises: large-scale combat.</TE>
<TE>   Fights can get really big. It's not uncommon to have 100 players
or more in a single battle. It can be confusing to have so many
look-alike characters running around.</TE>
<TE>   For many players, joining a "blood pledge" can make up for the
game's shortcomings. Blood pledges are essentially guilds of players
who agree to fight together.</TE>
<TE>   The number of blood pledges in the game fosters a lot of bickering
over the chat channels, and this often leads to mass warfare.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fighting for bragging rights, pledges can take
control of castles, which bestow additional benefits to their owners.
The only way to get a castle is through more mass warfare.</TE>
<TE>   These grand battles are the one redeeming feature of "Lineage,"
and if you are looking for a pure player-versus-player combat game,
it might be worth a try.</TE>
<TE>   But if you are looking for a more interactive environment with
cutting-edge graphics, fast-paced action and subtle combat
strategies, you're better off with "EverQuest," "Ultima Online,"
"Asheron's Call" or "Dark Age of Camelot."</TE>

<HD>Scaring Up Some Fun</HD>
<DH>Five games based on 'Monsters, Inc.' let children work and
play with Sulley and Mike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JINNY GUDMUNDSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disney Interactive has spun out five computer software titles from
its movie "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   "Monsters, Inc. Scream Team Training" and "Monsters, Inc. Scare
Island" are well-crafted titles that are definitely worth exploring.
The other three, however, are just undistinguished arcade games.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   "Monsters, Inc. Scream Team Training"</TE>
<TE>   This activity-based software for children ages 5 to 9 continues
the delightful creativity that is characteristic of the movie. Disney
has developed 10 activities that stay true to the theme of the movie
while challenging young children to think. This fun thinking occurs
when children "punch in" at Monsters, Inc. as a new employee.</TE>
<TE>   Players choose one of six different monsters. Roz, the sneering
slug-shaped mistress of Monsters, Inc.'s paperwork, conducts a short
orientation. She explains that by working hard, players can progress
through 10 jobs in hopes of eventually becoming a "Top Scarer."</TE>
<TE>   As the low monster on this corporate ladder, a player debuts in
the mailroom. The "job" is to sort mail by shape, color, numbers or a
combination of similar attributes. Performing well in the mailroom
opens up other job opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Children can "work" in the lunchroom where they stave off a
feeding frenzy by correctly filling food trays with hungry monsters'
requests. They can be promoted to the Door Vault where they direct
Sulley, the "hunky" monster star of the movie, through a grid of
hanging doors.</TE>
<TE>   All 10 activities provide a good workout in logical thinking. They
are cleverly intertwined into the world of Monsters, Inc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Monsters, Inc. Scare Island"</TE>
<TE>   For children 8 and up, here is an opportunity to play with
Monsters, Inc. movie stars Sulley and Mike. Set as a prequel to the
movie, players meet up with the scare-duo at their initial training
program before they are top performers at Monsters, Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The format of this software is an action game. Players take on the
persona of either Sulley or Mike. At an orientation session conducted
by Roz, players learn how to move, jump, break through objects, scare
and attack interfering toys. To pass the training program (and win
the game), players must explore 12 places on Scare Island.</TE>
<TE>   In each location, players encounter troublesome toys that can zap
their health, and robotic children on which to practice scaring.</TE>
<TE>   To win, players earn medals based on how thoroughly they explore
the environment. Scare five robotic children and you will win a
bronze medal; collect 10 monster tokens and you've got yourself a
silver medal.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-D graphics are not the best in the industry, but they create
interesting and complex environments for children to explore.</TE>
<TE>   For parents concerned about violence, these monsters do wreak
havoc by smashing things (usually toys or crates) but they stay true
to the characters presented in the movie. Their dialogue and antics
are wonderfully entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Wreck Room Arcade Games"</TE>
<TE>   Even monsters need an arcade room in which to unwind. That is the
premise for these three arcade games that are sold separately. With
the characters from the movie, children can play "Bowling for
Screams" (a bowling game), "Eight Ball Chaos" (a variation of pool)
and "Monster Tag" (a variation of "pong"). Although these games are
not expensive at $10 each, none is special.</TE>

<HD>Sharp Sees Advantages in Linux for Zaurus PDA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK A. KELLNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Could this be the time for a hand-held computer running Linux as its
operating system?</LD>
<LD>   Sharp Electronics Corp. certainly hopes so. Last week the firm
introduced its Zaurus SL-5500 Personal Mobile Tool, due to hit stores
in early March.</LD>
<LD>   Built around Intel Corp.'s StrongARM 206-megahertz processor, the
device includes 64 megabytes of standard memory, an MP3 and MPEG-1
multimedia player, a built-in voice recorder and a high-resolution
color screen.</LD>
<TE>   The device is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.</TE>
<TE>   A price hasn't been determined, but Steve Petix an associate vice
president of the firm, said it would be in the range of Pocket PC
devices such as the Hewlett-Packard Jornada 560 and the Compaq iPaq.
That puts it at about $550 to $650.</TE>
<TE>   Although Linux is widely touted for use as a network and Internet
Web server, it can be a good operating system for small devices.
Several set-top-box manufacturers have proposed using Linux, and
other firms are eyeing the software to control vending machines, ATMs
and other devices.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp's Petix said Linux has a much smaller "footprint" on the
hand-held than does Microsoft's Pocket PC 2002 operating system,
leaving room for more programs and more user data.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp's marketing director, Randy Dazo, said using Linux is less
expensive than licensing Pocket PC software from Microsoft. Also,
Sharp wanted an operating system that could be used on several
different devices, including cell phones and digital TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Danika Lewis, a Sharp product manager on the Zaurus line, said
separately that the firm is working with 1,500 third-party software
developers to create applications for the hand-held.</TE>
<TE>   The Zaurus SL-5500 in many respects resembles a Pocket PC. The
large color-display screen and "hot buttons" on the front of the unit
quickly start key applications. The Zaurus comes with programs to
view, edit and write Microsoft Word and Excel files.</TE>
<TE>   There's also an e-mail program and a contact manager that Sharp
says will synchronize flawlessly with Microsoft Outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Slide down the lower portion of Zaurus' front cover and a small,
thumb-friendly keyboard is revealed. The keyboard can be used to
compose quick e-mails and other text messages.</TE>
<TE>   Such keyboards have become popular thanks to devices such as
Research In Motion's BlackBerry and usually are a $50 optional add-on
for iPaqs and similar hand-helds.</TE>
<TE>   The Zaurus includes a CompactFlash slot for a wireless modem or a
local area network antenna. There's also a Secure Digital Memory Card
slot where extra memory can be added.</TE>
<TE>   In a demonstration by Sharp--a unit was not available for
individual testing before press time--the Zaurus seemed capable of
all the functions its makers claimed, such as playing music, handling
digital photos and wireless communications.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp's Lewis said she has been using the synchronization software
for several weeks without a problem, but there was no independent way
for me to assess the synchronization with Outlook.</TE>
<TE>   David Hayden, a Palo Alto mobile-computing consultant, said he
does not expect Linux to be an issue for companies that decide to buy
the Zaurus.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharp has the best PDA hardware and a very good plan to entice
developers and create solutions for enterprise customers," Hayden
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, it doesn't become an operating-system
issue but a holistic PDA solution," he said.</TE>

<DH>Putting the PC in a public room lets parents monitor kids'
usage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When her daughter hops on the computer, Kathy Corbin isn't far
behind.</LD>
<LD>   The Corbins' computer is in the family room, where Kathy and her
husband, Dave, can keep an eye on their three children while cooking
dinner.</LD>
<LD>   "It works well in the family room because that's where we spend
the majority of our time," Kathy Corbin said.</LD>
<TE>   Although the home office remains the most common place for the
family computer, a number of households prefer a more public place.
But exactly where to put a computer is a dilemma many parents have
yet to solve. About as many families keep PCs in a bedroom as in a
recreation or family room, according to a UC Irvine study.</TE>
<TE>   Child advocates encourage parents to keep the computer in social
spaces where children can be monitored. Since families already spend
much of their time together in such areas--many parents read to their
children in the living room, for example--placing the computer in the
open makes computing a family activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more natural way to start your children's experience with
a computer as a social tool," said Alan Simpson, spokesman for the
National Assn. for the Education of Young Children.</TE>
<TE>   Although younger children may need more parental supervision while
on the computer, the family PC should be kept in a public place
regardless of a child's age, said Sandra Calverts, a professor of
psychology at Georgetown University.</TE>
<TE>   "You just don't want your child to end up in a place where they
are in over their heads," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The push for placing the PC in a family space is in response to
Internet pornography, said Maria Papadakis, associate professor of
urban affairs and planning and director of the Institute for the
Social Assessment of Information Technology at Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   To protect children from seeing inappropriate material online,
many child-advocacy groups urge parents to monitor their children's
computer usage more closely.</TE>
<TE>   During the mid-1980s, when UC Irvine management professor Alladi
Venkatesh began studying home computer usage, many families kept PCs
in the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   A number of households have since moved the PC to other parts of
the house: home office (29%), den or recreation room (16%), living or
family room (15%) and kitchen (4%), according to studies done by the
university's National Outlook for Automation in the Home project.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that 16% of households still store the computer in
the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at other technologies in the home, you can
immediately designate a place [for them]," said Venkatesh, who
directs the NOAH project. "Computers have not reached this stage."</TE>
<TE>   Only about one-third of households have special furniture for
their computers and less than one-tenth have special furniture and a
space configured specifically for the computer. One household may
keep the computer on a desk while another keeps it on a coffee table
and yet another puts it on the kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   "People are trying to negotiate their space in a way that makes
sense in terms of their lifestyle," said Venkatesh, associate
director of the NOAH project.</TE>
<TE>   Most families must consider how the space around the computer will
affect its use, and vice versa. Those with children who use the
computer for homework may keep it in an area away from a television
to avoid study distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Practical issues, such as the location of electrical outlets or
telephone jacks, also dictate where a computer is placed.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Deans of Alisa Viejo set up the family computer in a
bedroom walk-in closet. With four children, there isn't enough room
in the house for a separate office or den.</TE>
<TE>   The configuration has worked well, though."They have to go through
me before they actually get through there," she said.</TE>

<HD>Expo's Other Big Hit: iPhoto</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You don't have to be a propeller head to know that the biggest hit at
last week's Macworld Expo was Apple's redesigned iMac. Although some
critics have compared its looks to that of a propeller-topped beanie,
most have praised the new design.</LD>
<LD>   At the Expo, I watched hundreds of attendees test-drive the new
iMac, and all of them did the same thing when they first approached
the computer.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than reach for the mouse--the first instinct of most test
drivers--they reached for the iMac's pivoting display and moved it
around. It's hard not to be impressed with how smoothly the iMac's
flat-panel screen floats to just about any viewing angle. And it's
easy to wonder why all displays aren't as accommodating.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to my pre-Expo predictions, Apple did not discontinue the
original iMac. In fact, Apple quietly cut its price during the Expo.
A 600-megahertz model containing a CD burner and 256 megabytes of
memory now costs $999, down about $200. Remember that this model
contains a G3 processor, which is much slower than the new iMac's G4
chip.</TE>
<TE>   Apple's other big hit at the Expo was its new iPhoto digital
photography software, which is free for the downloading and runs only
under Mac OS X.</TE>
<TE>   iPhoto's simple, one-window design greatly simplifies organizing
and sharing digital photos. iPhoto stores all of your images in a
digital shoebox called the photo library. You add photos to the
library by importing them from a digital camera--iPhoto recognizes
most current models. If you already have a collection of digital
images, you can add them by dragging their icons into the iPhoto
window.</TE>
<TE>   iPhoto makes it amazingly easy to scan your photo library.
iPhoto's window displays small thumbnail versions of each image;
below the thumbnails is a little slider that resembles a volume
control. Drag the slider to the left, and the thumbnails shrink to
baby-toenail size, allowing you to scan hundreds of images in one
glance. Move the slider to the right, and the thumbnails grow, until
finally iPhoto's window shows just one image at a time.</TE>
<TE>   This on-the-fly zooming is remarkable to watch--and it's made
possible by the sophisticated graphics foundation of Mac OS X.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've built a photo library, you can create albums. You can
publish albums on the Web using Apple's free iTools service, and you
can order photographic prints and books. You also can view albums as
on-screen slide shows, complete with background music and movie-like
dissolve effects between images--another graphical trick made
possible by OS X.</TE>
<TE>   iPhoto lets you tweak images, but its editing features are
bare-bones. You can crop and rotate photos, remove the dreaded
red-eye and convert a color image to black and white. iPhoto has no
tools for pixel-level editing, such as removing a blemish, nor does
it provide color-correction features.</TE>
<TE>   Other limitations? iPhoto doesn't let you choose which images you
want to import from a digital camera. Importing is an all-or-nothing
deal, which means you waste disk space storing unwanted photos, or
you waste time deleting photos you wouldn't have transferred to begin
with.</TE>
<TE>   Some of iPhoto's limitations are due to its version 1.0 status,
but politics also may be to blame. Apple must tread lightly in the
world of image editing, lest it alienate one of its most important
software developers: Adobe, whose Photoshop software is as important
as oxygen to many Mac users.</TE>
<TE>   Adobe has nothing to fear from iPhoto. Neither do companies that
make image-cataloging programs, such as iView Multimedia's iView
Media Pro. Novice users will be happy within iPhoto's comfortable if
limiting confines, and as they become more sophisticated, they can
buy programs that do more. Rather than eroding sales of third-party
programs, iPhoto and Apple's other "i-ware" might just act as a
steppingstone to them.</TE>

<HD>3 Visions of New Home Systems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE J. MAGID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When three technology executives make essentially the same
proclamation on the same day, it's probably something big. The only
question is whether it's the beginning of something real or just
another fad.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Apple Chief Executive
Steve Jobs and Moxi Digital CEO Steve Pearlman each told the world
about technology that can control, coordinate and link home
entertainment and information systems.</LD>
<LD>   Part of that vision already has come true.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of people already use PCs and Macs to store their music
collections--songs they download from the Internet or rip from
commercial CDs. And many use their PCs to burn audio CDs to enjoy in
the living room or when they're away from home.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the PC also has become a digital darkroom and photo
library. Most PC users with digital cameras no longer shelve their
photos in albums, but store them on hard drives. A growing number of
creative souls are using personal computers to edit and store their
home movies--sometimes copying the finished product on a VHS tape or
DVD so they can play them on TV.</TE>
<TE>   PCs with DVD players are sometimes pressed into service for movie
watching. Some people have even equipped their systems with TV
tuners, turning their PC into a sophisticated boob tube.</TE>
<TE>   If Gates and Jobs have their way, you'll no longer have to make
those CDs, DVDs or videotapes. Your PC will be connected to your TV
set and to speakers throughout the house, and there will be a
wireless link to your portable audio players and perhaps even your
car stereo. They have a computer-centric view of the world of digital
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft and Apple want their systems to become the center of the
digital universe. In November, Microsoft announced its eHome
initiative, which, among other things, would turn PCs into home
entertainment centers capable of delivering video, audio, home movies
and digital photographs to screens throughout the house.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, during his keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show
last week, elaborated on the concept. "You could literally connect
back to any applications on the PC and have that information and
interaction with those [home entertainment] devices as you please,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jobs made similar comments during his keynote speech at last
week's MacWorld Expo, just before he introduced the new flat-screen
iMac.</TE>
<TE>   Moxi's Pearlman has a different idea. He used CES to announce the
Moxi Media Center--a device that serves as a personal video recorder,
satellite or cable tuner, CD/DVD player and music jukebox as well as
a hub, or gateway, that can deliver the Internet or data to PCs that
are connected via Ethernet or a wireless network.</TE>
<TE>   The device can support up to four TVs as well as multiple PCs and
speakers throughout the house. To be sure, Moxi's device is a
computer. It has an 80-gigabyte hard drive and a FireWire port to
enable users to add external hard drives. It runs the Linux operating
system and has plenty of other PC components.</TE>
<TE>   But it looks and acts more like a VCR than a PC. Therein lies a
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Convergence between PCs and TVs may sound cool, but it doesn't
always make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Moxi Digital--which will be sold by cable and satellite
providers--makes perfect sense because it is a dedicated device. It
can perform specific tasks without the complications of software and
a user interface designed primarily for productivity tasks rather
than entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry Mr. Gates, but I'm afraid I can't say the same about using
Windows as the center of my home entertainment system.</TE>

<HD>Putting a Stop to Ads That Pop Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave Wilson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to find a Web site today that doesn't shove huge, noisy,
intrusive ads down your throat. They pop up, pop under, pop over and
crawl around whatever it is you're trying to look at.</LD>
<LD>   Harsh economic times have spurred Web sites to risk alienating
their users.</LD>
<LD>   "The sites don't have any choice," said Donna L. Hoffman, a
management professor at Vanderbilt University who studies electronic
commerce. "The trend over the past few years is to create ads that
are even more intrusive."</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, you don't have to put up with it. There are a number
of ways you can avoid seeing these pop-up ads, and I'll tell you how
in just a minute.</TE>
<TE>   But you'll need to be prepared to update whatever technology
you're using to block pop-ups on a regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   The same forces that have driven Web sites to adopt the
advertising approach of late-night television also are forcing them
to continually develop new technologies to break through your pop-up
defenses.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising market tanked with the rest of the economy last
year, which led to a lot of unsold ad space on Web pages. At the same
time, consumer response to traditional Internet banner advertisements
has plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers clicked on a Web page's banner ad about 2% of the time
in 1996, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. Now that figure has fallen
to less than half a percent, prompting advertisers to demand more
effective presentations.</TE>
<TE>   "Web sites are allowing advertisers to do this despite the risk,
testing consumer tolerance more and more," said Marissa Gluck, a
senior analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "There is definite evidence that consumers are incredibly annoyed
by these ads," she said. "In 2001, our research found that 41% of
respondents found such ads so annoying that they'd be less likely to
return to a site."</TE>
<TE>   Some consumers have reached their limit.</TE>
<TE>   "There are several Web pages that got so bad with the pop-ups that
I just stopped visiting them," said Don Soper, a Portland, Ore.,
computer programmer.</TE>
<TE>   Soper said he's more than willing to put up with some advertising
to get free access to an online newspaper, but when the ads block
what he's trying to read he'll just stop using the site.</TE>
<TE>   Most major newspaper Web sites in the United States, including the
Los Angeles Times, use such ads, a trend Soper finds increasingly
annoying.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can't read the page, there's no reason to go there," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, who evaluates Web sites, said not enough consumers have
stopped using sites because of intrusive ads to change the way
business is done on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Gluck said sites know that if they limit what an advertiser can do
with an ad, the money will simply go to another site.</TE>
<TE>   "These are desperation moves on the part of publishers because
they will take any advertising they can get," Gluck said. "But the
long-term effects remain to be seen."</TE>
<TE>   One effect has been an explosion in the number of programs that
will let you avoid these advertisements. Some browsers let you limit
pop-up windows.</TE>
<TE>   Check out Opera at www .opera.com, a pleasant alternative to
Netscape and Internet Explorer, though it doesn't work perfectly with
every Web site because many developers don't test with Opera.</TE>
<TE>   To work with your current browser, consider installing a program
such as Panicware's Pop-Up Stopper, available at www.panicware.com.</TE>
<TE>   The pro version, about $20, works only with Internet Explorer and
Windows but has great features. The free version works with Internet
Explorer and Netscape but is a bit limited. You can test both for
free.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Up Killer works with a ton of browsers, but is only for
Windows. It's free and available at software.xfx.net/utilities/pop
upkiller/index.html.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Not is $12 shareware available for a 10-day free trial. It's
strictly for Windows and Internet Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   And Webwasher, at www .webwasher.com, is free for individuals and
works on several different platforms, including the Mac, and both
Internet Explorer and Netscape.</TE>
<TE>   A few Web sites will try to block users with browsers that shut
down pop-ups. If the site is important to you, you can always shut
down the pop-up filter.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Soper and others have done, you can just say no to sites
that cross the line between advertising and hucksterism.</TE>

<HD>Spammers Outfox Blocking Command</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I'm running Windows 2000 Pro. When I use the Block Sender
command, it does not block the sender. Apparently the From
designation on the spam message is not where it's actually from,
rendering the Block Sender command meaningless.</LD>
<LD>   Is there a way to determine the true From designation and block
it?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The short answer is no. But it's a little more complicated
than that.</LD>
<TE>   Spammers usually create a bogus return address, because most
Internet service providers don't allow people to send spam. Irate
recipients of spam tend to drop electronic bombs on ISPs that send
it.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible to look at the e-mail headers and determine the true
source of e-mail, regardless of whether the return address has been
spoofed or not, but that's not a process that will help you with the
Block Sender function.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I own a Compaq Presario 1700 with a DVD player. I'd like to
hook it up to my 27-inch TV so I can watch DVDs there instead of on
the 15-inch notebook screen. What is the easiest, cheapest way to do
this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Just a few months ago we'd have suggested getting a video card
with TV output and installing that in your computer at a cost of $75
or less.</TE>
<TE>   But this can be a daunting task for somebody who's never cracked
the case on a computer before. Plus, depending on where the computer
is, you'll probably have to string cable to the TV set.</TE>
<TE>   These days, however, the easiest and cheapest way to do it is to
buy a DVD player. Several models are on the market for well under
$100.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a friend who has a computer that is 5 or 6 years old.
She is concerned that the battery is dying.</TE>
<TE>   Can she prevent this? If her battery dies, is her computer a total
loss?</TE>
<TE>   A: If the battery dies, your friend will have a lot of problems.
It's best to correct this now.</TE>
<TE>   Although the internal battery can be replaced by a layperson, it's
probably best to let a technician handle this chore.</TE>
<TE>   If you want to try this yourself, however, the friendly geeks at
Q&amp;A labs will give you an abbreviated how-to.</TE>
<TE>   First, make backups of your data. Then note your computer's
settings by writing them down on a piece of paper. You can usually
get to the Settings screen by hitting a key when the computer is
starting up. Replace the battery, reboot, go back into Settings, make
sure the configuration matches your original, and you should be done.</TE>
<TE>   Use extreme caution, however, or you could be left with a dead
box.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have just purchased a new computer with an XP system and I
was wondering if it is open to hackers. If so, what can I do to
prevent that?</TE>
<TE>   A: Microsoft's new XP system has a number of serious security
problems right out of the box, so the first thing you'll need to do
is visit the company's Web site and download whatever software
"patches" are available to plug the holes.</TE>
<TE>   Like all operating systems, any computer connected to a network is
vulnerable to attack. You'll want to set up a firewall, which will
block many types of intrusion. And you'll want to make sure you're
running some kind of anti-virus software that's updated frequently.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, avoid opening e-mail attachments. It's still the most
common way outsiders get access to a computer.</TE>

that offer product samples.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On more than one occasion, online product pictures and descriptions
have failed me.</LD>
<LD>   The "ruby" sweater I recently received, for example, just wasn't
the same shade of red as the sweater shown on the site. Though such
discrepancies are usually minor, in this instance, the sweater was
meant to match a certain skirt. I had to return it.</LD>
<LD>   Online shopping often is a gamble. Because you can't hold the
product in your hands before the purchase, you never know what you
are going to get until you get it. This can be especially problematic
when a purchase, such as the sweater, is meant to pair up with
something you already own.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, some sites offer product samples for free or a small
fee. Simply fill out an online request form and receive a small
swatch in about a week. Whether you're shopping for a sweater or a
sofa, these sites offer samples that you can hold up against the
living room drapes to make sure they match.</TE>
<TE>   Pottery Barn</TE>
<TE>   Pottery Barn offers swatches for window covers and its upholstered
furniture at www .potterybarn.com. Unlike some sites, which send only
the colors a customer specifies, Pottery Barn will mail all of the
swatches available for a particular product.</TE>
<TE>   Within a week of placing my order--the site advertises a seven- to
10-day delivery--I received samples of Pottery Barn's velvet drapes
(with names such as amber, wine, lichen, espresso and taupe) and
leather furniture (cognac, black, chocolate, caramel).</TE>
<TE>   The swatches, about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide, were soft to
the touch, and the leather maintained its smell.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware</TE>
<TE>   Restoration Hardware also provides swatches for some of its
leather furniture, but I could not order them online. The site, at
www.restorationhardware .com, indicates items for which swatches are
available and includes the company's customer service number.</TE>
<TE>   I called the number, and the customer service representative said
she would be happy to send me samples for one of the leather
recliners. More than a week later, I was still waiting for them to
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   Smith &amp; Noble</TE>
<TE>   Smith &amp; Noble, which produces window treatments and custom home
furnishings, offers samples for every product sold online, including
blinds, bedding, tablecloths and rugs.</TE>
<TE>   It has one of the most--if not the most--extensive swatch
collections on the Internet. One round tablecloth on the site boasted
302 swatches.</TE>
<TE>   Swatches can be ordered with a catalog number or by selecting from
the samples shown online at www.smith andnoble.com.</TE>
<TE>   The site charges $5 for up to 10 swatches, but place an order of
at least $100 within 90 days and the $5 charge is deducted from the
total bill.</TE>

<TE>   Home Depot</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot doesn't include product samples, but it does sell
flooring in 6- to 12-inch squares online. Options are limited,
however. The site, at www.homedepot.com, featured only four carpet
samples, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Carpet samples cost 50 to 75 cents, vinyl tile samples cost 39
cents to $1.99, and sheet vinyl samples cost 50 cents to $1. There
also were a few ceramic and natural stone tiles that ranged from
about $1 to $9.</TE>
<TE>   Hardwood floor samples are not available, as panels are sold only
by the crate.</TE>
<TE>   I ordered carpet, vinyl tile, sheet vinyl and natural stone tile
squares for $5.49. But because my order was a purchase, and not a
sample request, I had to pay for shipping. The cost for the four
samples came to $10.40.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End offers swatches of its clothing online at www

<LD>   If only logging on to your Amazon.com account were that easy.</LD>
<LD>   Since nearly every online merchant requires that customers create
personal shopping accounts, it's likely that you have more than one
user name and password--and don't remember which one opens what
account.</LD>
<TE>   One online service, Catavault (www.catavault.com), boasts an "all
access pass" to the Internet, saving user names and passwords for
more than 3,500 sites.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, you must create a user name and password to obtain a
Catavault account, but the service claims that's the only combination
you'll need to remember.</TE>
<TE>   To get started, you input your combinations from other sites, then
save them in your personal "vault." Catavault says it encrypts the
data before storing it and does not give employees access to personal
information.</TE>
<TE>   When you want to shop at any site at which you have registered,
simply log on to your vault, which has links to all of the sites.
Click on the link, and automatically log on to that account.</TE>

<HD>Donald Baer, 69; Founder of UTLA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Baer, who merged two fractious Los Angeles teacher groups into
a single union, United Teachers-Los Angeles, and led members in a
landmark five-week-long strike against the Los Angeles Unified School
District in 1970 which established the precedent for teachers'
collective bargaining rights throughout California, has died. He was
69.</LD>
<LD>   Baer, who served as executive director of UTLA from its inception
in 1968 until 1980, died Saturday in Woodland Hills after a long
illness. No specific cause of death was disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   "Don Baer changed the relationship between teachers and the school
district," Leo Geffner, attorney for UTLA from the time it was
formed, said in a statement. "He had the complete trust of the other
side at the bargaining table."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Milwaukee, Wis., Baer graduated from the University of
Wisconsin and served in the Army. He taught in Milwaukee schools and
served as executive secretary of the Milwaukee Teachers' Education
Assn. before moving to Los Angeles in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   He merged the National Education Assn. affiliate, Assn. of
Classroom Teachers-Los Angeles (ACT-LA) and the American Federation
of Teachers Local 1021, developing a model for the 1975 state law
requiring each school district to select a single bargaining unit.</TE>
<TE>   Baer resigned in 1980 amid a shake-up in which elected union
officials complained that he and other staff executives dominated
union policy and activities. Baer then joined the staff of the
California Teachers Assn., where he remained until his death.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Janis; three sons, Gregg, Chris and
Kyle; and one daughter, Julie Milton; a brother, Robert; and two
grandsons.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Anti-Terrorist Proposals Send the Wrong Message to
State Voters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis caught a break Tuesday. Assembly Democrats dumped
his plan to expand telephone eavesdropping and allow peeking at
e-mail of suspected criminals, especially terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush recently signed legislation that broadened the
feds' wiretap powers, but it didn't give the states permission to do
what Davis wants, according to the Legislature's top lawyer. Davis
wants to conduct roving wiretaps that, for example, keep pace with
the bad guys' repeated switch of cell phones.</LD>
<TE>   After the legislative counsel opined, Davis' ideas were quickly
deleted from a bill being considered by a hostile Assembly Public
Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   And that was a good break for Davis, although he may not have
realized it. Voters emphatically reject his wiretap and e-mail
proposals, according to a poll being released today by the
nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   As a pollster might say, the governor got off on the wrong track
with likely voters by advocating these anti-terrorist measures in his
State of the State address. The PPIC survey found that 35% favor his
ideas, 63% don't.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, only 39% of voters say they're more concerned about the
government failing to enact tough anti-terrorist laws than they are
that the government will "excessively restrict the average person's
civil liberties." The majority, 52%, are more worried about civil
liberties.</TE>
<TE>   California voters do lean libertarian, after all. They favor
abortion rights, gay rights and medicinal marijuana. They fight
government taxes and racial preferences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in the DNA of voters in this state to want government to
play as limited a role as possible in their personal lives," says
PPIC pollster Mark Baldassare.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of government messing around with their phone calls or
e-mail makes people very nervous."</TE>
<TE>   The poll shows Democrat Davis slightly trailing Richard Riordan
(37% to 41%), his probable Republican challenger in November. The
former mayor is running miles ahead of his GOP rivals: Riordan 41%,
Secretary of State Bill Jones 13%, political novice Bill Simon Jr.
4%.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' overall job performance is not so hot, voters say: 46%
approve, 49% disapprove.</TE>
<TE>   Clues to the governor's weaknesses--current and potential--can be
found in the poll.</TE>
<TE>   His continued advocacy of telephone and Internet snooping could
hurt him. "He risks losing supporters," says Baldassare, because
voters concerned about civil liberties currently favor Davis over
Riordan by a comfortable margin.</TE>
<TE>   There's strong evidence that Californians think Davis has been
focusing on the wrong subject: anti-terrorism. Two-thirds approve of
his handling of the issue, but they don't really care. Asked which
issue facing the state is the most important for the governor and
Legislature to address, terrorism/security ranks far down (4%).</TE>
<TE>   Education again tops the list (20%), followed by energy and the
economy (each 14%).</TE>
<TE>   Nearly four in 10 voters think Davis is "a lot to blame" for
California's energy problems.</TE>
<TE>   On public schools, people are evenly divided: 39% approve of his
performance, 40% disapprove.</TE>
<TE>   They don't think schools have been getting better. A majority
(55%) believe student test scores rank below average or near the
bottom nationally.</TE>
<TE>   That's also what they thought before Davis was elected. In truth,
scores have been inching up steadily in reading and math and now are
around average.</TE>
<TE>   But a PPIC poll last month found that two-thirds of Californians
think schools actually are no better or have gotten worse.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't feel there has been the kind of improvement the
governor promised," Baldassare says. "They're grading him tougher and
tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Davis does have successful stories to tell about education and
energy, but he has been off chasing TV about the National Guard and
Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Advisors wanted him to back off in the State of State and focus
more on other issues, but Davis insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Who knows! Vietnam vet. Clinging to a big story. Trying to
look presidential. Genuinely scared for California.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a frustrated field marshal lurking inside that man," says
one associate.</TE>
<TE>   Too often when Davis does talk about education, it's at a
hackneyed event in some school multipurpose room, using children as
TV props.</TE>
<TE>   The message is blurred in a montage of cute little kids and is
hard to take seriously.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor will have plenty of time and money--nearly 10
months and around $50 million--to get the word out.</TE>
<TE>   The word should not be wiretap.</TE>

<HD>Jones Answers Questions on Immigration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Illustrating the difficult balancing act facing conservative
Republicans in moderate California, GOP gubernatorial contender Bill
Jones praised the role of immigrants in the state Wednesday--but
added that he would support Proposition 187, with modifications, if
it were proposed again today.</LD>
<LD>   Jones' qualified endorsement of the 1994 initiative, which
severely limited government benefits to undocumented immigrants, came
in response to repeated questions about immigration in a stop at the
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, the secretary of state, used the appearance to establish
his party credentials and present himself as the only Republican in
the race who can win a statewide election. He touted his endorsement
from a Latino group as evidence he can reach across political divides
and build a winning coalition.</LD>
<TE>   His comments on Proposition 187 also set him apart from his
Republican rivals, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and
businessman Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who took no position on the measure during the 1994
campaign, now says it would be too divisive. Simon would oppose it
because he believes the federal government should deal with illegal
immigration, spokesman Bob Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates' views on immigration reflect changes in California
since the mid-1990s, when Gov. Pete Wilson rode Proposition 187 and a
backlash against illegal immigration to a second term.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, a federal judge has gutted the initiative and the
number of Latino voters has swelled and moved solidly into the
Democrats' corner. Republicans have lost all state offices except
secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who badly trails his rivals in fund-raising, reminded the
crowd of Republican faithful at the Nixon Library that he was
chairman of the Fresno County Young Voters for Nixon in 1972 and
noted that he won two statewide races during years in which
Republicans lost all other statewide offices. He also criticized
Riordan for running "to the left of Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Jones then pointed out that Democrats outnumber Republicans in
California and said that only someone with experience winning
statewide races could oust Davis, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Showing how he could broaden his appeal, Jones ended his speech on
a pro-immigrant note, saying that California "has the most diverse
and dynamic public in the world."</TE>
<TE>   He cited endorsements from the Mexican-American Political Assn.
for his gubernatorial run, and from the state's largest
Spanish-language newspaper in his last race for secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the audience followed up with questions about
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Jones sidestepped the first question--whether he would support
another version of 187, which he endorsed in 1994. The secretary of
state said he supported a guest worker program like the one proposed
by President Bush last year but opposed Bush's proposal to give
amnesty to Mexican immigrants. "I'd be willing to commit any
resources to protect the borders," Jones said. "I have always
supported legal immigration. I am opposed to illegal immigration."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, a woman stood up and said she wanted to continue to
press Jones on the "uncomfortable" issue of immigration. "It seems to
be a very big problem, but the Republicans seem to be out for the
Latino vote instead of the American vote," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said that as secretary of state he has pushed to keep
illegal immigrants off the voting rolls and sued the federal
government to expunge illegals from rolls before implementing a new
voter registration law. "That's the only thing I could control at the
time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, reporters asked Jones twice whether he would back 187
again. On the second question, Jones said he would support a new
initiative, provided it was amended so children would not be barred
from receiving services. "Children should have an opportunity to go
to school and be taken care of," he said. But, Jones added, "illegal
immigration is something that is unsustainable."</TE>
<TE>   In his comments, Jones made his standard criticism of Davis,
charging that the governor has botched the energy crisis and is
putting the state in debt so he does not have to make politically
difficult cuts. "Gray Davis will be pushing his deficit onto the next
governor," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   He also took his regular swipes at the Republican credentials of
Riordan, who has given thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates,
said last week that he may support same-sex marriages and is
pro-choice.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a question, Jones said that Orange County voters
should decide the fate of a plan to convert the El Toro Marine base
into an airport, although he said the data he has seen indicates it
may not be needed.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EL CAJON</DL>
<LD>A 75-year-old woman whose husband perished after setting out to find
help survived more than 24 hours without food or water.</LD>
<LD>   Rosemary Maloney and her husband were leaving the Sycuan casino in
a remote area east of San Diego on Sunday afternoon when William
Maloney made a wrong turn on a dirt road and their car became stuck.</LD>
<LD>   William Maloney, 83, set out on foot for help, leaving behind his
wife, who relies on a walker. As she waited for him, night fell and
temperatures dipped into the 30s. She covered herself with sheets she
pulled from the back seat.</LD>
<TE>   "I put them over my head and breathed the warm air," she said. "My
nose was so cold and my fingers were too."</TE>
<TE>   When the sun rose, she tried to drink the dew that had settled on
her car and on nearby leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Around 4 p.m. Monday, a motorcyclist discovered the car.
Paramedics called to the scene spotted William Maloney's body about a
quarter of a mile away from the couple's car. Sheriff's officials
said it appeared that he had collapsed and fallen down an embankment.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Sycuan casino said customers have become lost
leaving the casino in the past because they must drive on
back-country roads for about 10 miles before hitting Interstate 8 or
California 94. He said the casino would work to improve signage.</TE>

<HD>Michael Bilandic, 78; Succeeded Daley as Chicago Mayor</HD>

<LD>Michael Bilandic, 78, the mayor who took over after popular Chicago
Mayor Richard J. Daley's death in 1976, died Tuesday in Northwestern
Memorial Hospital of heart rupture after suffering a heart attack
Friday and another on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bilandic served as mayor from 1976 to 1979, but failed to win even
his Democratic primary election to his own full term.</LD>
<LD>   He was defeated by Jane Byrne, whom he had fired, as she delivered
a stunning blow to the storied Democratic political machine.</LD>
<TE>   Bilandic, a native of Chicago, was an alderman who moved up to
succeed Daley in the traditional machine hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers believe Bilandic caused his own defeat with his
handling of the Chicago blizzard of January 1979. He authorized more
than $300,000 in consulting fees to a former deputy mayor, including
a $90,000 contract for snow removal that faltered in the face of a
20-inch snowfall.</TE>
<TE>   Black leaders were angered when train stations serving their
neighborhoods were closed during the blizzard, impeding
transportation to jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Bilandic served on the Illinois Supreme Court from 1990 to 2000
and became its chief justice in 1994.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jane Montant, 85, who helped transform Gourmet magazine from a food
publication into a lifestyle magazine for the affluent, died Jan. 1
at her home in New York City. She had been battling Parkinson's
disease, emphysema and liver cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Montant was editor in chief from 1980 to 1991, when she retired.
During her tenure, Gourmet's circulation rose from 671,000 to
895,000. Under her leadership, Gourmet attracted talented writers
such as James Beard, Joseph Wechsberg and Richard Condon.</LD>
<LD>   Although Gourmet was the acknowledged leader among food magazines,
it considered itself a lifestyle magazine for the affluent. In
addition to hiring veteran cooks who could create recipes, the
magazine had articles on foreign travel.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Boston, Montant grew up primarily in New York City. She
started at Gourmet in 1953, answering letters from subscribers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorothy Leona Friend, 93, longtime activist for the recovery of
alcoholics, died last Thursday of lung cancer at West Hills Hospital
in Canoga Park.</LD>
<LD>   In 1975, Friend co-founded Odyssey House, a home for recovering
alcoholic women in Canoga Park. The nonprofit halfway house, now
Women's Odyssey Organization, helped hundreds of women in the ensuing
years.</LD>
<LD>   Friend, who managed Odyssey House in its early years, continued
for decades to help raise funds for the facility and served as a
counselor to countless women.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Globe, Ariz., Friend settled in Los Angeles in 1961. She
was a legal secretary for many years and later worked for United
Recording Co. in Hollywood. There she met Ellis Boatner, an executive
with the firm, and the two of them started Odyssey House.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a quality that was not flamboyant but was almost
invisible. Yet you knew she was there," Boatner said. "It was the
difference between saying a prayer and being a prayer."</TE>

<HD>Utility Panel to Offer Alternative to PG&amp;E Bankruptcy Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>State regulators on Wednesday won the chance to show that they have a
feasible alternative to a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. bankruptcy
reorganization plan that would preempt dozens of state laws.</LD>
<LD>   Over vehement objections from PG&amp;E, federal bankruptcy Judge
Dennis Montali ordered the Public Utilities Commission to submit a
blueprint for its plan by Feb. 13 so he can determine whether it
should be allowed to compete with PG&amp;E's proposal.</LD>
<LD>   Montali said he was skeptical but did not want to disregard the
PUC's alternative because there are serious objections to PG&amp;E's plan
that, depending on how he rules in the coming weeks, could block it.</LD>
<TE>   "I need the commission to tell me and show me that it really has a
sensible alternative that is worth putting on the table," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also signaled that he may bring in a mediator to resolve
some of the disputes between the PUC and PG&amp;E that have surfaced in
the bankruptcy proceedings and augur protracted legal appeals.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
April, asked for and was granted an extension of its exclusive right
to present a reorganization plan to creditors and the court.</TE>
<TE>   But Montali allowed the PUC to submit a "term sheet" for an
alternative plan, outlining how PG&amp;E's assets and other sources of
funding would be distributed among PG&amp;E's thousands of creditors.
Then the judge will decide whether the PUC can submit a formal plan.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent filing, the PUC said that its plan would use $4.9
billion in cash and other means to repay the company's creditors
within a year. The PUC argues that its approach is cleaner than
PG&amp;E's, which involves paying large creditors 60% in cash and 40% in
notes. The PUC says it also avoids the specter of years of litigation
over PG&amp;E's plan to preempt state laws and regulations, including the
PUC's authority to approve the transfer of utility assets.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E's lead counsel, James Lopes, argued that allowing the PUC to
submit an alternative plan would delay the case and confuse the many
creditors who had agreed to back PG&amp;E's plan, and that it would
undercut the confidence of money market managers who would help
finance it.</TE>
<TE>   "The PUC is opening another front in its war against PG&amp;E and its
shareholders," said Lopes. "We believe the PUC and the state would do
anything to derail our plan." He acknowledged that there have been no
meaningful talks with the PUC since the company filed for bankruptcy
almost nine months ago, blaming the PUC for the company's billions of
dollars in energy crisis-related debts.</TE>
<TE>   Montali said he was disappointed that both sides have not tried to
work out their differences. He ordered them to explain at a Jan. 25
hearing why he should not order them to meet with a mediator.</TE>
<TE>   That same day the judge is scheduled to hear arguments on PG&amp;E's
attempts to preempt state laws as part of its plan to become a
stand-alone utility while shifting transmission and generation assets
to subsidiaries of its parent company. The PUC has called this plan a
regulatory jailbreak, while the company says it is shifting
regulation from the PUC to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the issue, Montali said, could determine whether
PG&amp;E's plan can be used to bring the company out of bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen said outside court that mediation
could be helpful in resolving the disputes. But he added, "As long as
the agenda is removal [of PG&amp;E] from state regulation, we will oppose
that."</TE>
<TE>   In a full-page ad in major newspapers, PG&amp;E and its parent fired
back Wednesday against a lawsuit filed by state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer. The ad said allegations that the parent company illegally
siphoned more than $4 billion from the utility "are false and
unwarranted" and intended to impede PG&amp;E's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer spokeswoman Sandy Michioku said the lawsuit was filed
because the parent company broke its promise to the state that it
would help keep the utility sound. "The parent corporation cannot
escape that responsibility," she said.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Starts State Bus Tour, Criticizes Davis</HD>
<DH>Campaign: The ex-L.A. mayor blames the governor for the
state's fiscal problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan cast himself as a rescuer of California's ailing
economy on Wednesday as he set off on a statewide bus tour to promote
his campaign for governor.</LD>
<LD>   On a daylong swing through San Diego, the Republican candidate
painted a dark picture of California under Democratic incumbent Gray
Davis, who plans to counter months of GOP attacks by launching his
first TV advertising today.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, cited troubles with
traffic, housing, water, health care, energy and education, but most
of all the economy. Overall, he lamented what he called "a total
vacuum of leadership in California."</LD>
<TE>   "I personally feel I have to fill that vacuum," he told GOP
business leaders at a San Diego Lincoln Club breakfast in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   The event was the first of six Riordan campaign stops Wednesday in
San Diego, the first city on a bus tour that also has stops scheduled
this week in Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan visited two high-tech corporations, greeted voters at a
mall, hit a few golf balls and rode a bicycle around the UC San Diego
campus.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Riordan, 71, has made a point of demonstrating his
physical vigor on the campaign trail. At the breakfast, he joked that
he loved the hotel where he had spent the night because he was the
"the youngest person in the gym."</TE>
<TE>   "There was a woman about 97 on a crawler lifting weights," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast, Riordan boarded the huge black bus rented by his
campaign--a former home-on-the-road for basketball star Dennis Rodman
and singers Chaka Khan, Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Andrea Bocelli
and Lenny Kravitz.</TE>
<TE>   "My God, I've never seen a bus like this," Riordan said as he
settled into a black leather sofa in the rear lounge.</TE>
<TE>   The bus has a granite tile floor, mirrored ceiling, three
large-screen TVs with DVD players and VCRs, microwave oven, and a
refrigerator and freezer. It also features "a flushing ceramic
toilet, not the Greyhound thing," said owner Vince Moroney of
Encinitas.</TE>
<TE>   From La Jolla, Riordan traveled to the headquarters of Titan
Corp., a high-tech company. Among Titan's products is machinery that
bombards mail with radiation to kill anthrax spores. It also sells
equipment that irradiates fruit, vegetables and meat to kill
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Titan Chief Executive Gene Ray told Riordan the radiation does not
change the taste or texture of a hamburger. But Riordan joked, "I'm
never going to eat again."</TE>
<TE>   On the bus, Riordan was asked whether irradiated food should be
labeled as such in grocery stores. He responded with an expletive,
saying it was the sort of "gotcha" question that turns him off.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not an expert," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speeches, Riordan outlined his plans to stimulate the
economy. He promised to streamline regulations to speed approval of
new factories, power plants and housing developments. He said he
would build cargo-only airports to create jobs, but did not say
where. Riordan also said he would build highways between Silicon
Valley and the Central Valley to encourage high-tech manufacturers to
expand operations within the state.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're the most liberal person in the world, you should want
businesses to thrive," he told executives over lunch at HNC Software.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis, Riordan charged, has scared businesses away from
California with excessive red tape.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also criticized the governor for increasing public
spending and adding 34,000 employees to the state payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "We need somebody who is fiscally tough," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   At breakfast, Riordan said Davis had turned the largest surplus in
California history into "what looks like it could be the largest
deficit"--projected at more than $12 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Did he put a penny away for a rainy day? No," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   "How are we going to get out of this quicksand?"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan declined to specify what programs he would cut to close
the budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan faces two rivals in the March 5 GOP primary, Secretary of
State Bill Jones and Los Angeles investment banker Bill Simon Jr.,
but he limited his attacks to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis reelection campaign, said
California has gained nearly a million jobs during the governor's
three years in office and grown from the world's seventh-largest
economy to the fifth-largest.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get that way from not being business friendly," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said Davis set aside $2.6 billion in reserves last year,
the state's largest rainy day fund in 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Davis today starts broadcasting the first TV
advertisements of his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The upbeat ads tout Davis' record on education, the environment,
energy and law enforcement and end with the slogan, "Effectiveness
you can count on."</TE>

<HD>Davis to Keep Pushing for Expanded Wiretap Power</HD>
<DH>Security: Governor and GOP lawmakers both say state needs
added authority despite negative legal opinion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis reaffirmed his commitment Wednesday to expanding
California's wiretapping laws despite a legal opinion from the
Legislature's top lawyer that the centerpiece of that plan--roving
wiretaps for state and local police--exceeds the state's powers.</LD>
<LD>   Davis also said during a news conference that wiretapping
legislation by Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount) that was
sharply pared back this week amid legal and civil liberties concerns
contained only some of his suggestions. Davis called for roving
wiretaps last week in his State of the State address.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that if that is good enough for the federal
government, it is good enough for state government," Davis said of
expanding wiretapping for state and local authorities. "Some people
suggest that the Washington bill exceeded the federal provisions.
That is not our intent."</LD>
<TE>   Washington's measure, AB 74, initially would have allowed state
and local authorities to run roving wiretaps on suspected criminals
and also conduct surveillance of e-mail and Internet communications.
Both were identified by Davis and his new security advisor, George
Vinson, as areas where the Democratic governor was seeking to expand
state law to mirror federal law.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington trimmed both provisions out of his bill Tuesday. It
now merely would allow state and local authorities to obtain wiretaps
against people suspected of possessing weapons of mass destruction or
biohazardous agents such as anthrax. It also expands the general
authority of police and prosecutors to use wiretaps in the state,
which is set to expire next year.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative counsel's office, which advises lawmakers on their
bills, notified Washington before the hearing on his measure that
although President Bush had recently signed a law to bolster
wiretapping by federal authorities to target terrorists, states were
not authorized under federal law to use roving wiretaps.</TE>
<TE>   Davis administration officials downplayed the legal opinion but
acknowledged they may now push for less-expansive changes in
wiretapping law.</TE>
<TE>   With regular wiretaps, police and prosecutors have to request
permission from a judge to listen to a specific phone line. Roving
wiretaps allow authorities to have the surveillance follow the
suspect, tapping any phones the person might use without going back
to a judge for permission.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and Sheriff Lee Baca
have advocated roving wiretaps at the state level, arguing that state
law has failed to keep up with technological advances and criminals
can now easily thwart conventional wiretaps by switching phones.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are really talking about is trying to get someone who
uses multiple mobile phones to escape detection, which is something a
lot of narcotics dealers are now doing," said Jim Provenza, the
district attorney's legislative director.</TE>
<TE>   But civil libertarians have denounced the idea, arguing that
roving wiretaps trample on the 4th Amendment's limits on government
searches. They also argue that wiretaps result in few convictions
compared with the countless private conversations they violate.</TE>
<TE>   "They are using the specter of terrorism, but the reality is this
would be used in California to go after drug dealers," said Francisco
Lobaco, legislative director for the American Civil Liberties Union.
"The feds are going to handle all terrorism cases."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Washington's measure has been the only bill dealing with
the wiretapping issue, but some Republicans upset over the direction
of the debate may introduce their own legislation. Assemblyman Rod
Pacheco (R-Riverside), a former prosecutor, said he is outraged that
liberal lawmakers are trying to block what he sees as common-sense
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things we can do," Pacheco said. "The thing that
disturbed me most was the easy willingness to abandon the safety of
our constituents. How do you forget what happened on Sept. 11? That
[Washington] bill does nothing now."</TE>
<TE>   However, with the Legislature controlled by Democrats, lobbyists
and lawmakers said the chances of a GOP lawmaker passing a
wiretapping measure are remote. Washington's bill is still considered
the likely vehicle for changes to wiretapping law--and many of those
involved in the issue say a compromise is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement advocates are shifting focus from roving wiretaps
to a system that would allow police and prosecutors to quickly add
new phone numbers to existing wiretap orders. That would still
require a judge's approval, but would be handled under an expedited
process in which authorities would not have to resubmit all previous
paperwork.</TE>

<HD>UCOKs Merced Campus Study</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A University of California campus near Merced moved a key step closer
to reality Wednesday as the university's regents endorsed
environmental and development plans aimed at a groundbreaking as
early as May.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting at UCLA, a key committee of the regents gave preliminary
approval to the 2,000-acre, often controversial project's final
environmental impact report and plans for its central infrastructure.
Approval by the full board is expected today.</LD>
<LD>   UC system officials and representatives of the Merced campus said
they were pleased at Wednesday's unanimous votes. But opponents,
including environmental activists, warned of possible litigation.</LD>
<TE>   The Merced campus, the university's 10th, would be the first new
UC campus to be launched since the mid-1960s, when Irvine, San Diego
and Santa Cruz were established in rapid order before today's
extensive environmental regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The regents gave initial approval to the environmental report,
which pledges to preserve sensitive wetlands in the campus area
northeast of Merced. The UC also promised other measures to protect
the endangered fairy shrimp and other rare species that inhabit the
site.</TE>
<TE>   The campus is planned to be built on about 1,800 acres of
grasslands and 200 acres of what is now a golf course. The first
phase is expected to open to its first class of about 1,000 students
in 2004, and the completed campus eventually would enroll about
25,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   UC Merced Chancellor Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, who was appointed in
1999 and has overseen the planning process, said that the votes
marked a "historic moment" but that it also represents the start of
more work in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Witham, a biologist who heads a Davis-based environmental
group, said that litigation to stop the project was likely. The
state, she said, was risking spending millions on work that might
later be abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials have said they are confident they have met state and
federal requirements so far.</TE>
<TE>   As the regents met in Covel Commons, about 100 students rallied
noisily outside, urging them to allow undocumented immigrants to pay
the much lower, in-state fees to attend UC. The policy change, which
regents are to consider today, would bring the university into
compliance with a new state law already affecting Cal State and
community colleges. The demonstrators later met briefly with two
regents, who promised to consider their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, UC officials released figures showing that
applications were again at record highs, with more than 95,000
students applying for admission for the fall, an increase of 3.4%
from last year. Applications from all ethnic groups, including
underrepresented minorities, were up, while those from international
students applying for entry as freshmen dropped nearly 15%.</TE>
<TE>   UC spokeswoman Lavonne Luqois said that the international student
figures tend to fluctuate and that the drop could not necessarily be
pegged to the events of Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Paul Fannin, 94; U.S. Senator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Fannin, an Arizona Republican whose two-term career in the U.S.
Senate from 1965 to 1977 was marked by fights to limit the influence
of unions, died of a stroke Sunday at his home in Phoenix, his family
said. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   A three-term governor of Arizona, the conservative Fannin won the
seat of longtime friend Sen. Barry Goldwater, who did not seek
reelection in 1964 after winning the Republican presidential
nomination.</LD>
<LD>   As a freshman senator with relatively little clout and name
recognition, Fannin struggled in 1965 to focus attention on the
proposed elimination of a provision of the Taft-Hartley Act that
restricted union activities.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed amendment, championed by organized labor, many
Democrats and President Lyndon B. Johnson, would have eliminated
so-called right-to-work laws passed by a number of states restricting
compulsory union membership.</TE>
<TE>   "Fannin was the only one paying attention to the issue," said Reed
Larson, president of the National Right to Work Committee, who was
active during the Senate fight. "For a time, it looked like he was
going to have to go it alone." Eventually, a coalition of Republicans
and Southern Democrats united to defeat the change.</TE>
<TE>   Fannin denounced the strikes of the late 1960s and early 1970s in
various industries, saying they threatened the country's economy and
security.</TE>
<TE>   The ranking Republican on the Interior Committee, Fannin was often
the spokesman for the Nixon and Ford administrations on energy
policy. He opposed new limits on strip-mining and expanding Interior
Department authority over federal land.</TE>
<TE>   Among his proudest achievements was sponsoring the Central Arizona
Project, which piped water from the Colorado River to the Phoenix and
Tucson areas, greatly aiding development.</TE>
<TE>   He did not run for reelection in 1976, citing his wife's flagging
health.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Ashland, Ky., Fannin's family moved to Arizona when he was
a toddler. He attended the University of Arizona before transferring
to Stanford, where he graduated with a degree in business.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, he returned to Phoenix and worked in the family
hardware business before starting a gas and petroleum equipment
company with his brother. After selling the company, he decided to
run for public office, winning the governor's office in 1958, 1960
and 1962.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, he fought to increase public education funding to
metropolitan areas and to equalize the state property tax.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Senate, he served on the board of the Central
Arizona Project and worked with energy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Elma, died last year.</TE>
<TE>   His survivors include three sons, Bob, the chairman of the Arizona
Republican Party; and Tom, both of Phoenix; and Bill, of Petaluma,
Calif.; a daughter, Linda Rider of Phoenix.; 10 grandchildren; and
nine great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Michael Young, 86; British Thinker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   Lord Michael Young, a leading influence on British social policy
who coined a word with his satirical account of the ruling class,
"The Rise of Meritocracy," has died at 86.&amp;lt;252&amp;gt;Young, who had
cancer, died at his London home Monday, his family said.
&amp;lt;252&amp;gt;The author of the Labor Party's manifesto for the general
election of 1945, Young was a key architect of Britain's modern
welfare state. A champion of citizens' rights, his formation of the
Open University and the Consumers' Assn. in Britain became famous
around the world. &amp;lt;252&amp;gt;"The Rise of Meritocracy," published in
1958, a bestseller in 12 countries, helped create broad support for a
pluralistic society and introduced a new word into the English
language. &amp;lt;252&amp;gt;Trained as a barrister, he became an educator,
author, political activist and consumer advocate.&amp;lt;252&amp;gt; He was
described by some colleagues as a "pyrotechnician" for his tendency
to fire off ideas on a vast range of subjects but leave it to others
to deal with the administration of the many institutions he founded.
&amp;lt;252&amp;gt;Born in Manchester to a musician father and an artist
mother, Young spent his early years in Australia before returning to
England.&amp;lt;252&amp;gt; His education from the age of 14 at the
progressive Dartington Hall School in Devon influenced his thinking
throughout his life. &amp;lt;252&amp;gt;Leonard Elmhirst and his American
wife, Dorothy, who had inherited part of the Whitney fortune, had set
up the school as a center for education, agricultural development and
rural industry.&amp;lt;252&amp;gt; Young became a trustee of the school in
1942 and published an account of the Elmhirsts' work in 1982.
&amp;lt;252&amp;gt;One of his better-known projects, the Consumers' Assn.,
rose from research at Dartington. &amp;lt;252&amp;gt;The association's Which?
magazine, a consumer publication that provided product testing and
comparisons, was first published in 1956 and is still in print.
&amp;lt;252&amp;gt;Young's idea of offering adult education courses on early
morning television became the prototype for the Open University
launched by Harold Wilson in 1964.&amp;lt;252&amp;gt; Young also started the
National Extension College and the International Extension College
for Third World students.</TE>

<HD>AMR Unit, Continental Post Losses</HD>

<LD>American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and Continental Airlines posted
massive fourth-quarter losses Wednesday in the aftermath of Sept. 11,
but the losses weren't as bad as expected and the carriers said
they're hopeful of a financial rebound this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Continental, in fact, predicted it will be profitable again in
March, which would make it one of the first airlines to return to the
black. The carrier was among the few that were profitable before the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the weakening economy already was
undermining the industry's profits.</LD>
<LD>   But the two airlines said their recent gains mainly reflect a
steady increase in leisure travel because of fare sales, and that
business travel--the key to their longer-term prosperity--still shows
no immediate sign of rebounding. "A lot of our flights are full ...
but we're getting there mostly by heavily discounted fares, not by
getting business traffic," Continental President Larry Kellner told
analysts in a conference call.</LD>
<TE>   The carriers also hinted that more fare sales will be needed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be pressure to continue filling up capacity"
until the economy rebounds, said Tom Horton, AMR's chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were the first airlines to announce fourth-quarter
results, capping a year in which the industry is expected to report a
combined annual loss exceeding $6 billion because of the drop in air
travel after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For American, the nation's largest airline, the quarter ended an
especially horrific year.</TE>
<TE>   Two of its jetliners were used in the terrorist attacks, and two
months later an American jet crashed in suburban New York, killing
all 260 aboard. American, like most major airlines, also slashed its
operations and laid off thousands of workers to handle the plunge in
air travel. And in its latest cutback, American said Wednesday that
it's going to return up to 30 of its new 717 jetliners to their
manufacturer, Boeing Co., sooner than planned.</TE>
<TE>   AMR inherited the planes when it bought Trans World Airlines last
year. But American already has other airplanes similar in size to the
100-seat 717 and wants to streamline its fleet. Boeing builds the
plane in Long Beach, but sales have been slow and American's move
could put more pressure on the plant, which Boeing nearly shuttered
last year.</TE>
<TE>   In agreeing to take the planes back in the second and third
quarters this year, Boeing said it will seek other buyers for the
jets.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Dallas-based AMR lost $734 million
before one-time charges and gains, including its portion of the
federal government's cash bailout.</TE>
<TE>   It was a record quarterly loss for AMR, and company Chairman and
Chief Executive Donald Carty said the airline "still has a long way
to go to return to profitability." Horton predicted "quite a
substantial loss" for AMR in the current quarter as well, but
declined to elaborate on the airline's future results.</TE>
<TE>   Still, AMR's fourth-quarter loss--equal to $4.75 per diluted
share--was less than the $5.08 a share forecast by analysts surveyed
by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Including the bailout cash and other one-time items, AMR had a
fourth-quarter net loss of $798 million, or $5.17 a share, compared
with a profit of $47 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   For the year, AMR's loss including the federal aid and other
one-time items was $1.8 billion, or $11.43 a share, compared with a
profit of $770 million, or $4.76, in 2000. AMR's annual revenue fell
4% to $19 billion from the prior year.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Continental said its fourth-quarter loss before
one-time items was $220 million, or $3.81 a share. After including
$110 million of after-tax aid from the federal bailout and other
items, Continental's net loss was $149 million, or $2.58 a share,
versus a profit of $44 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, Continental's net loss including special items was $95
million, or $1.72 a share, compared with a profit of $342 million, or
$5.45, the prior year. Its annual revenue fell 9% to $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   AMR's stock rose 23 cents a share, to $26.02, and Continental's
jumped $1.71, to $31.10 a share, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Banks in Tailspin</HD>
<DH>Global economy: The financial institutions have to shoulder
the losses and defaults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Banks, including American institutions such as Citigroup and
FleetBoston, that made seemingly sensible bets on Argentina's economy
in the mid-1990s are now on the hook for billions of dollars in
losses, as the nation's devaluation and freezing of deposits have
pushed the banking system to the verge of collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Citigroup is expected to announce the extent of its Argentine
losses today.  Argentina is deemed to be a small sliver of its
overall operations and no real threat to its stability.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the $15 billion in Argentine bank
equity that was on the books a few months ago may have largely
vanished. The extent of losses is still impossible to pin down
because the government is changing the rules governing its exchange
policy and deposit freeze on an almost daily basis.</LD>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, the Argentine banking system appeared to be
a pillar of strength, after having attracted billions of dollars from
foreign investors who acquired roughly half of the system through
enormous bets on the future prosperity of Latin America's
third-largest economy.</TE>
<TE>   A long and devastating economic recession, and government
decisions, have combined to swamp Argentina's domestic and
foreign-owned banks. The measures include the devaluation, the
conversion of dollar-indexed loans to devalued pesos and the
government default on its bonds, of which $30 billion are held by
banks.</TE>
<TE>   The implications are harsh for the banks but worse for Argentina's
economy as it tries to climb its way out of its deep financial
sinkhole. Without a functioning banking system to deliver credit and
move funds through an economy, there can be no financial activity
inside the country or trade outside it.</TE>
<TE>   Business activity has largely shut down in Argentina. Trade, which
in the past has been the escape hatch for countries suffering
devaluations and economic depressions, has slowed because credit
isn't available.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no [bank] equity in economic terms," said Gabriel
Caracciolo, S&amp;P's associate director for Argentina. He said banks are
not making loans or taking deposits. "So, the status of Argentina's
banking system is that it's closed."</TE>
<TE>   With foreign institutions justifiably leery of throwing any more
money Argentina's way, a bank rescue as part of a massive
international assistance program from the International Monetary Fund
may be the only way to get the system working again, analysts say. A
government plan to tax international oil sales and use the proceeds
to help recapitalize banks is viewed as inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't recapitalize the banks, the economy will never
recover," said Bruno Pereira, Latin American bank analyst for UBS
Warburg in Rio de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   The 28% devaluation announced by Argentina on Jan. 6 is only one
of a host of problems that banks face. To ease the pain of the
devaluation for the middle class, new Argentine President Eduardo
Duhalde also announced that all loans under $100,000 that had been
dollar indexed would be payable in devalued pesos--in effect making
it easier to pay back the loans.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Duhalde promised Argentines that they would
someday be able to retrieve their $45 billion in dollar-denominated
bank deposits--two-thirds of the total.</TE>
<TE>   So in one swoop, banks were told that the earning power of their
assets or loans were cut 28% while their obligations to depositors
hadn't changed, creating an instant balance sheet implosion and an
operational nightmare. Pesos continued to lose value this week
against the dollar, hurting banks' portfolios even more.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the government's declaration of default on $135
billion of public debt delivered another blow to banks which hold
almost one quarter of those bonds. A default meant an immediate drop
in banks' bond interest income.</TE>
<TE>   It gets worse. This week the government was believed to be on the
verge of converting all loans over $100,000 to peso denominations,
digging an even deeper hole for banks. The backdrop to all this is a
worsening economy making consumer and business borrowers bigger
credit risks.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict Duhalde will eventually have to give in and
convert dollar deposits to devalued pesos as well, distributing the
pain of the devaluation more evenly among consumers as well as banks.</TE>
<TE>   "In this context, the promise to dollar depositors that they will
get their money back is unbelievable if you add up all the losses
being piled on the shoulders of the banks," S&amp;P's Caracciolo said.</TE>
<TE>   As for now, Citigroup and FleetBoston are bracing for hundreds of
millions of dollars in losses, and J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of
America also are in jeopardy of losing money. But their exposure is
dwarfed by two Spanish banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  and
Banco Santander Central Hispano, whose combined losses could exceed
$4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   FleetBoston is more vulnerable than Citigroup. On Monday, Moody's
downgraded FleetBoston's debt to negative after the bank said it
would take more than the $150 million in loss provisions attributable
to Argentina that it had announced Dec.19. It also said it would
delay release of its fourth-quarter earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Bernstein/Alliance says that FleetBoston's Argentina
losses might exceed $500 million.</TE>

<HD>FERC Approves Pipeline to Mexico</HD>
<DH>Energy: Gas-delivery project will stretch from southwest
Arizona to electric power plants in Baja California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday approved the
construction of a gas pipeline from Arizona to Baja California,
clearing the way for a major extension of the North American pipeline
grid into the fast-growing border region of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The 215-mile pipeline's main purpose is to deliver gas produced in
U.S. and Canadian wells to several electric power plants under
construction or already built in Baja California. Power generated at
the plants will then be delivered to energy-hungry Baja consumers and
manufacturers, as well as to California.</LD>
<LD>   The pipeline someday could deliver northbound gas from Baja to the
United States, if the liquefied natural gas terminals proposed for
Baja materialize. Both Sempra Energy of San Diego and El Paso Corp.
of Houston plan giant liquefied natural gas terminals on the Baja
coast to meet gas shortages in Mexico and the southwest United
States.</LD>
<TE>   The international pipeline that will stretch from southwest
Arizona to Tijuana was opposed by Imperial County environmental
groups that say pollution in the Imperial Valley, already the highest
in California by some measurements, would worsen from exhaust from
the Baja power plants the pipeline will feed.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have 30 days to appeal the agency's ruling before
construction begins, an agency spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Partners on the pipeline project are Sempra Energy and PG&amp;E
National Energy Group of Bethesda, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The 135-mile Baja portion of the pipeline already has been
completed by Sempra. Construction of the PG&amp;E Corp. unit's 80-mile
U.S. portion can proceed now that the regulatory commission has
approved a federal environmental study of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Barring reversals, construction will begin next month with
completion this summer in time to supply gas to a new 1,000-megawatt
power complex under construction west of Mexicali by InterGen of
Boston. As much as one-third of the InterGen facility's power will be
exported to California.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline also will bring gas to a 500-megawatt plant being
built in Mexicali by Sempra set to open in summer 2003. The line also
will serve a oil-fueled power plant in Rosarito Beach, Baja
California, owned by Mexico's federal utility, that is converting to
gas.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of faster permit processing and more lenient
environmental rules, U.S. companies are building or planning several
gas-powered generators to supply growing demand in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial County board of supervisors passed a resolution
opposing a six-mile cross-border electricity transmission line
connecting the new power plants with the U.S. grid unless InterGen
uses cleaner-burning pollution technology on two of its four
generators at the Mexicali project.</TE>
<TE>   The new Sempra plant has incorporated the cleaner technology,
Imperial County air quality officer Steve Birdsall said.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court Rules Utility Pole Fees Can Be Regulated by
the FCC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that federal regulators can
limit the rates utility companies charge cable operators to use
utility poles to provide high-speed Internet access, a victory for
cable giants AT&amp;T Corp. and AOL Time Warner Inc.</LD>
<LD>   There are more than 6.4 million Americans who subscribe to the
fast Internet access through cable operators, while roughly 3 million
get similar services from telephone companies using a technology
called digital subscriber line.</LD>
<LD>   Overturning a lower court ruling, the Supreme Court said the
Federal Communications Commission has the discretion to limit rates
for utility pole use, regardless of the type of service offered. The
high court said the rules also apply to equipment wireless
telecommunications providers attach to poles.</LD>
<TE>   Utility companies and cable operators have been fighting over the
fees for so-called pole attachments, stringing service lines to
35-foot to 40-foot poles mostly owned by power companies. A 1978 law
required companies that allow attachments to do so on reasonable
terms and conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC in recent years had regulated the terms and the rates
cable companies paid, including companies that offered high-speed
Internet service, leading to the court challenge by utility
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court's decision reversing and remanding the case back
to the appeals court could prove pivotal for the deployment of
high-speed Internet service. Cable companies had warned that rates
might go up if the owners of poles could charge any fee.</TE>
<TE>   The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. has said that, in
one case, a utility company demanded $38 a pole per year, up from $7.</TE>
<TE>   The association warned that, if rates were unregulated, the cost
for cable service could rise $1.50 a month on average.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the FCC will tentatively decide this matter before
long and that it is likely to determine that cable broadband is an
information service, thus keeping it free from regulation," Legg
Mason analyst Blair Levin said in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit had ruled that,
because the Internet has not been defined as a cable service, the FCC
could not regulate prices. The appeals court also had ruled that the
FCC lacked the authority to regulate the placement of wireless
equipment on utility poles and the rates charged.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cadiz Inc. agreed to combine its Sun World International water and
farming business with an Egyptian agricultural company controlled by
billionaire Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica-based Cadiz will own 50.25% of the combined company.
Kingdom Agricultural Development Co., a private agricultural company
founded by Al Waleed, will control 49.75%, said Cadiz spokeswoman
Cynthia Coulter. Terms were not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The merger will enable Sun World to expand sales of its farming
and irrigation management business, Coulter said.</LD>
<TE>   Sun World has been managing Kingdom's effort to grow melons and
grapes on 100,000 acres in southern Egypt since 1999, according to a
Cadiz release. The Egyptian government is building a 43-mile canal to
funnel water from the Nile River to farms owned by Al Waleed and
other developers.</TE>

<LD>Customers of Edison International's Southern California Edison may
end up paying $1.2 billion the company is supposed to contribute to
the utility's recovery, consumer advocates said.</LD>
<LD>   Under a recovery settlement for Southern California Edison reached
in October, Edison shareholders would contribute $1.2 billion in
dividends to the utility. A resolution being considered next week by
the California Public Utilities Commission would require the
utility's customers to repay that sum, the PUC's consumer-protection
division said.</LD>
<LD>   "Ratepayers paying every dollar back does not constitute a
contribution by any reasonable definition I can think of," said Steve
Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocates.</LD>
<TE>   Rosemead-based Edison's shares fell 36 cents to $15.23 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providian Financial Corp., the sixth-biggest U.S. Visa and MasterCard
issuer, agreed to sell its proceeds from $8.2 billion in credit card
loans to J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. to raise cash and appease
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The loans, about a quarter of its business, are with Providian's
most creditworthy customers. The San Francisco-based company is still
trying to find a buyer for $3 billion in loans to customers with poor
or short credit histories.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators demanded in November that Providian improve its
capital ratios--measures of the company's cushion against unexpected
loan losses--after profit plunged because more customers with
blemished credit couldn't pay their credit card bills.</LD>
<TE>   Providian shares fell 46 cents to $4.33 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Morgan Posts 1st Loss in 5 Years</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Firm writes off loans to Enron and
Argentina. Low interest rates help Bank One report profit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL NOL and SCOTT SILVESTRI</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. posted its first quarterly loss in five years
as it wrote off loans to Enron Corp. and Argentina. Bank One Corp.
reported a profit, benefiting from the lowest interest rates in 40
years.</LD>
<LD>   "The real soft spot in the banking industry" is bad loans, said
Jim Russell, an analyst at Fifth Third Bank, which manages $31
billion and owns bank shares. "It's not just Enron--it's other
credits as well."</LD>
<LD>   New York-based J.P. Morgan Chase, led by Chief Executive William
Harrison, lost $807 million on trading and lending to Enron, the
bankrupt Houston-based energy trader, and Argentina, which devalued
its currency and defaulted on its bonds. It has an additional $2.5
billion of potential losses on its books.</LD>
<TE>   Bank One, run by former Citigroup Inc. President Jamie Dimon,
rebounded from a year-ago loss as lending at the Chicago-based bank
rose. It eliminated 2,300 jobs to cut costs. Rivals including Wells
Fargo &amp; Co. on Tuesday reported profit in the quarter because home
mortgages surged.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase, the second-biggest U.S. bank, lost $332
million, or 18 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of 34 cents a
share, or $708 million, in the same quarter in 2000. The stock fell
$1.67 to $36.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a good quarter and not a good year," said Chief
Financial Officer Dina Dublon.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase wrote off $456 million related to Enron and
still has exposure of $2.06 billion.  The bank traded commodities
with the energy trader and lent money to it. Last year, it advised
Enron, whose bankruptcy in December was the biggest in U.S. history,
on a failed attempt to merge with rival Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase also wrote off $351 million for its exposure to
Argentina, which devalued the peso to boost exports and pull the
country out of recession.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which set aside $510 million in the quarter to cover
the possibility of increased loan losses, also arranges loans to
retailer Kmart Corp., which is preparing to tap the remainder of $1.6
billion of credit lines to raise cash.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's said it lowered its outlook on J.P. Morgan
Chase's debt ratings to "negative," citing the write-offs. If the
firm is downgraded, it will have to pay more in interest on its debt,
$9.5 billion of which is due this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bank One earned $541 million, or 42 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter, after losing $512 million, or 44 cents, in the period in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Net income in retail banking, Bank One's biggest unit, with 1,800
offices in 14 states, was $293 million, compared with a loss of $25
million in the previous year. Net interest income, or what the bank
makes from lending, rose to $2.27 billion from $2.24 billion in the
year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   First USA , Bank One's credit card unit, had net income of
$326million, more than double what it earned in the same period a
year ago. The bank said bad loans rose 43% to $3.55billion and were
up 14% from the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dimon said last month that loan exposure to Enron was less than
$100 million. The company said Wednesday only that bad loans included
"a single energy-related credit and Argentina exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Bank One shares fell 85 cents to $37.75.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp., the second-most indebted independent
cable-television operator, said it raised $1.49 billion by selling
securities as part of a plan to reduce debt.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia said it sold 40 million Class A common shares at $25.50
each and $500 million in 71/2% convertible preferred stock.</LD>
<LD>   The sale may indicate the Rigas family, which controls
Coudersport, Penn.-based Adelphia, is unlikely to sell the company
for a premium because the stock was sold at about market prices,
investors said. The shares rose 41% in November and December, partly
on speculation Adelphia will be sold, say investors including
Federated Investors analyst Adrian Davies.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia shares were down 44 cents at $26.81 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>"The X-Files" TV show, an enormous asset to News Corp. and its
various divisions, will end its nine-year run on the Fox network in
May with the broadcast of the show's 201st episode.</LD>
<LD>   Fox said that series creator Chris Carter had decided to end the
series. Ratings for "The X-Files" have dropped dramatically this
season after the departure of one of the original stars, David
Duchovny, spurring speculation about its future.</LD>
<LD>   Produced by 20th Century Fox Television, "The X-Files" has
generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the Fox
network as well as through the sale of reruns and merchandising. A
theatrical film was released in 1998, and although the series is
ending, additional films are anticipated.</LD>
<TE>   The program's exit will leave Fox with a significant void to fill
in its Sunday-night lineup, especially since the future of another of
the network's long-running franchises, "Ally McBeal," also is in
question due to sluggish ratings.</TE>

<HD>GM Reports Profit to End Tumultuous Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Leaping ahead of its domestic competition in a declining market,
General Motors Corp. said Wednesday that it earned $255 million in
the fourth quarter, or 60 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   GM's nascent comeback occurred in a tumultuous year that combined
difficult pricing pressures after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and
intensified competition in cars and trucks.</LD>
<LD>   It was "a good quarter in a very tough environment," said John
Casesa, auto industry analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
"Deteriorating industry fundamentals and declining volumes will
pressure the company's results in 2002."</LD>
<TE>   For the year, the world's largest auto maker earned $1.5 billion,
or $3.23 a share, on revenue of $177.3 billion excluding special
items, down from a $5-billion profit, or $8.58 a share, on record
sales of $183.3 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After 11 years of losing market share in the U.S., GM managed a
slight improvement in 2001, rising from 28.2% to 28.9%, according to
the tracking firm Autodata. GM's share of the light truck market,
which includes sport-utility vehicles, grew more dramatically,
finishing the year with 29.2% of the U.S. market, up from 27.0.</TE>
<TE>   GM's net earnings for 2001 were $601 million, or $1.77 a share,
compared with net profit of $4.5 billion in 2000, or $6.68 per share.</TE>
<TE>   GM recorded positive results in North America and the Asia-Pacific
market and with GM's financing arm GMAC, which earned $435 million in
the quarter, up more than 6% from the same three-month period in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   GM's Hughes Electronics subsidiary, which is in the process of
being sold to EchoStar Communications Inc., lost $131 million in the
quarter, compared with a $74-million loss in the last three months of
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Automotive operations were not as profitable as we'd like, but
they were profitable. We're still losing a considerable amount of
money in Europe," Chief Financial Officer John Devine said in a
conference call with analysts and reporters. "Pricing was tougher in
North America, which cost us some profit, though not volume. Despite
the shortfall, we feel the earnings story is a pretty good one."</TE>
<TE>   Global auto operations earned $708 million, although in Europe GM
lost $767 million, due mostly to red ink at GM's German subsidiary,
Adam Opel.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely are performing better than their domestic rivals,
and they seem to have future momentum that the other guys don't
have," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, senior auto analyst with Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   GM regained momentum after Sept. 11 with zero- and low-interest
loans that were matched by the competition. While the programs were
costly, they supported healthy fourth-quarter sales, especially for
GM.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in good shape to meet the tough competitive challenges in
the year ahead," Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said. "As we continue
to introduce more new models this year and intensify our focus on
efficiencies and cost reductions, we're well-positioned when the
economy rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   The profit news caps a year where GM's fortunes went the opposite
way from archrival Ford, which is expected to report a loss of more
than $5 billion Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it is planning to close five North
American factories and eliminate 35,000 jobs in a sweeping turnaround
effort.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast GM hit a number of positive milestones in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It showed significant improvement in initial quality, and its
productivity outpaced its competition in two respected independent
studies in North America.</TE>
<TE>   GM hired respected industry veteran Robert Lutz as vice chairman
for product development in August, and later added the title of
chairman for North America.</TE>
<TE>   In four months, he already has tweaked the designs of a number of
upcoming vehicles and ordered up the Pontiac Solstice concept car--a
process that usually takes at least a year. It is now on display at
the Detroit auto show.</TE>
<TE>   Lutz says the Solstice, built largely from off-the-shelf GM
components, could be sold for $25,000, an indication that the auto
maker is likely to produce the car in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   And GM ended the year setting a record for the most light trucks
sold in the U.S., wresting the truck leadership title back from Ford.</TE>
<TE>   But executives are wary of the expected continued downturn in the
auto market this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've targeted significant reductions in material and structural
costs for 2002, in addition to reducing nonproduct-related capital
expenditures," Wagoner said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is continuing plans to reduce its salaried work force
by 10% a year--about 4,700 jobs in 2002--through attrition and
voluntary buyouts, Devine said last week. The number of contract
employees also will be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   GM has set a target for 2002 earnings of $3 a share, to be
achieved through cost cutting, including job reductions and
negotiating lower prices from suppliers, Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also needs to cut its production capacity further, he
said, noting that GM was producing at 84% of capacity in 2001. Given
that GM produced 4.9 million cars and trucks in North America last
year, that means the auto maker has about 900,000 extra units of
capacity, the equivalent of three or four full-size factories.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares slipped 21 cents on Wednesday to close at $49.75 in New
York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>

<HD>Compaq, Apple Results Are Upbeat</HD>
<DH>Technology: Shares of the computer makers rise after hours
on quarterly profit news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compaq Computer Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. reported quarterly
profits Wednesday that met or exceeded Wall Street expectations,
sending shares of both companies higher in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Compaq, the second-biggest personal computer maker
behind Dell Computer Corp., said it earned $92 million in the fourth
quarter, or 5 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss on
higher revenue. Analysts were expecting a profit of 1 cent a share.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose from the third quarter to $8.5 billion, above last
week's guidance of at least $8 billion, as buying surged in Europe
and Latin America.</LD>
<TE>   Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas also raised projections
for this year, predicting first-quarter revenue of $7.6 billion and
profit of 1 cent per share. Analysts had been expecting the company
to break even.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ability to exceed expectations in a tough business
environment demonstrates Compaq's strong focus on execution and our
solid market momentum," Capellas said.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq is trying to complete a deal to be acquired by
Hewlett-Packard Co., and Capellas said the company is committed to
helping HP woo shareholders and regulators for approval. But he
stressed that Compaq hasn't put any of its objectives on hold while
it waits for a decision.</TE>
<TE>   One weak spot in the results was a slide in profit from the
company's services operation, touted by HP as one of the prizes in
the planned merger. Capellas said Compaq needs to do a better job on
focusing on a handful of core services offerings, instead of trying
to do everything. Compaq shares fell 30 cents, to $11.10, in regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, then rose to $11.40 after the
earnings announcement.</TE>
<TE>   At Cupertino-based Apple, fiscal first-quarter profit of $38
million, or 11 cents a share, reversed a year-earlier loss of $195
million, or 58 cents. The per-share profit figure met analyst
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of $1.38 billion narrowly missed the company's projections,
but Apple predicted that the next quarter will be better than
analysts had been anticipating, with profit holding steady from the
last three months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is guiding expectations up for the first time in five
quarters," said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Andrew Neff.</TE>
<TE>   Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said early demand for
the company's new line of thin-panel iMacs was better than expected
and may well outstrip supply in the next three months.</TE>
<TE>   He cautioned that profit margins at Apple will fall from past
levels because component costs are high, the new iMac is priced
aggressively, and the firm must spend to change the production
methods used to make the old iMacs.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Apple would be happy to trade away profit margins to
get annual revenue back to its peak of $8 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The old margins were "pretty lofty," Anderson said in an
investors' conference call. "I don't think that should be your
expectation."</TE>
<TE>   The two computer makers' results are good news for the volatile
technology sector.</TE>
<TE>   But Anderson said he didn't see a turnaround in the economy yet,
and Capellas said he didn't anticipate a real resurgence in sales and
profit until the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Apple fell 92 cents to $20.78 in regular trading on Nasdaq, but
rose to $21.32 after hours.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings Wednesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Newport Beach communications chip maker Conexant Systems Inc.
posted its eighth consecutive quarterly loss, this one widening to
$204.5 million, or 80 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter, from
a deficit of $199.6 million, or 85 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell
44%, to $229.5 million from $410.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said revenue this quarter will rise "modestly" from
the previous period and that it will reduce its work force in the
current quarter by 150 to 200 people. Conexant employs 6,900 people.
Its shares fell 14 cents to $12.58 on Nasdaq and rose as high as
$13.95 after the report.</TE>
<TE>   * Sunnyvale chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported a
smaller fourth-quarter loss--$15.8 million, or 5 cents a share--than
analysts expected as holiday shoppers bought more personal computers.
The loss compared with a profit of $177.9 million, or 53 cents, a
year ago. Analysts expected AMD to lose 18 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell 19%, to $951.9 million. Advanced Micro raised its sales
forecast last month on strong demand for its new Athlon XP processor.
The company forecast a "small net loss" this quarter and said sales
will be about $900 million in the period ending in March. AMD shares
fell $1.24 to $17.91 in regular trading on the NYSE before the
announcement.</TE>

<HD>Ailing Kmart's Shares Fall 35%</HD>
<DH>Crisis: As company officials remain mum on swirling
bankruptcy rumors, credit agencies drop ratings and S&amp;P 500 drops
firm's listing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp.'s battered shares tumbled 35% more on Wednesday as credit
agencies slashed ratings for the nation's second-largest discount
retailer to highly speculative levels amid ongoing concerns that the
company may file for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Two major rating agencies, citing lack of information about how
the company plans to get its business back on track, cut their credit
ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's dealt the company an additional blow when it
removed the company from its widely watched S&amp;P 500 index after the
close of trading. The move forces mutual funds who tie their
investments to the index to unload the stock.</LD>
<TE>   As the bearish developments unfolded, Kmart's stock slumped 85
cents to $1.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, its lowest level in
more than 3 1/2 decades. A total of 178 million shares changed hands,
making the stock the most active in U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kmart has declined to comment after two days of meetings
by the board, analysts and retail experts said a bankruptcy filing
would allow Kmart to close hundreds of poorly performing stores.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 400 of the company's 2,100 stores are either
unprofitable or not making much money, said analyst Marie Driscoll
with Argus Research.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stores they should get rid of that are really
draining the financial and managerial efforts of this company," she
added.</TE>
<TE>   But management's silence may indicate that the company is pursuing
options other than bankruptcy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has been revealed at this point, and the stock just
continues to drop," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile a consultant warned that most of the retailer's
suppliers could halt deliveries as early as Friday if the company
keeps mum, according to Dow Jones.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of Kmart's suppliers have stopped deliveries
outright and another third were holding deliveries until there is
further word from the company, said Burt Flickinger III, who met with
manufacturing groups. He is a managing partner at Reach Marketing in
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart has been losing a bruising battle with two other retail
giants, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which often beats Kmart's prices, and
Target Corp., which many shoppers consider a trendier option.</TE>
<TE>   The Troy, Mich.-based retailer lost further ground to its
competitors when it suffered disappointing sales during the holiday
shopping season, casting doubt on an ambitious plan to spend billions
of dollars on inventory controls, new distribution centers and
conversion of standard stores to super centers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking at how are they going to execute their
strategy with less cash than they thought they would have," Driscoll
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Services cut
Kmart's ratings to a low junk-bond grade, and Moody's warned of
possible further downgrades. Fitch Inc. also lowered certain Kmart
debt.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kmart is attempting to arrange more financing, there is
little clarity about the company's financial plan "to support its
2002 business objectives," Moody's said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy also might cloud Kmart's exclusive agreement with
lifestyle guru Martha Stewart's merchandise in its U.S. stores.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides can pull out of the agreement if either files for
bankruptcy, but Stewart said late Wednesday in an interview with CNN
that she has no intention of severing the relationship, which gives
Kmart a well-known brand that draws shoppers and sets it apart from
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's company--Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.--reaps
annual sales of $1.5 billion as a result of the association, analysts
say. Kmart spokeswoman Julie Fracker said the retailer also expects
the association to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Other vendors also were wondering whether the turbulence at Kmart
will smudge their bottom lines, but others expressed confidence in
the company.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Diamond, chief executive of Designer Dress 98 in New York,
which makes dresses and sportswear for Kmart, said he has not
interrupted any shipments to the retailer and expects the company
will emerge from its current difficulty "smelling like a rose."</TE>
<TE>   Although firms that guarantee payments to wholesalers often
determine whether shipments are interrupted, Diamond said he shipped
goods valued at $5 million to the retailer at his own financial risk
when Kmart was struggling four years ago, and did not regret it.</TE>
<TE>   "They employ 225,000 people in America," he said. "The country
needs a competitor out there for Wal-Mart and Target to keep prices
fair and to keep the garment center itself strong."</TE>
<TE>   Kmart has laid off some workers at its stores and distribution
centers recently, spokeswoman Fracker said, but she described the job
losses as "routine seasonal adjustments." Workers who lost jobs but
were not hired just for the holidays could be rehired soon if
business warrants it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the workers that were affected will likely be called back
in February," she said. Fracker declined to say how many people were
laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Some real estate investment firms that lease sites to Kmart also
have seen their stocks fall. Shares of Malan Realty Investors Inc.,
which has 27 Kmart locations, slumped to a 52-week low Wednesday and
have fallen 15% this month. The stock closed at $5.69, off 27 cents a
share, on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate investment trusts rent 235 stores to Kmart, generating
annual rental income of $110 million, according to Credit Suisse
First Boston.</TE>

fourth-quarter profit at the closely held maker of Levi's jeans and
Dockers slacks fell 16%.</LD>
<LD>   Levi's eight U.S. plants employ about 4,400 workers, spokeswoman
Linda Butler said. The company's 21 worldwide factories employ about
9,000, Chief Financial Officer Bill Chiasson said.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Levi expects to close the Scottish plants in
the second quarter after talks with unions, Butler said.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Phil Marineau has cut inventory and lowered debt
to pare costs as annual sales fell for the fifth straight year in
2001 after reaching a record in 1996. He has introduced commercials
such as the "belly button" spot featuring the new Superlow jeans to
help lift sales. Levi's sales have been hurt as retailers reduced
orders on concern about the slowing U.S. economy, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is doing what it needs to do in order to position
itself for stabilization," said James-Scott Wong, a fixed-income
analyst at Barclays Capital in London.</TE>
<TE>   If the plant closings take place, Levi will take a charge in the
first or second quarter, Chiasson said. The company plans to talk
with its bankers next week to revise debt covenants as a result of
the proposed shutdowns, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levi, which got a U.S. patent in 1873 for adding reinforcing
rivets to denim pants, releases financial results because its debt is
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Butler wouldn't say how many jobs would be cut in the U.S. Levi
employs about 16,750 worldwide, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Net income in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 25 fell to $63 million
from $75.4 million in the year-ago period, the company said in a
statement. Sales fell 4% to $1.23 billion from $1.29 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Annual sales fell 8.3% to $4.26 billion, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Other California companies reporting earnings Wednesday: :</TE>
<TE>   * Genentech Inc. reported operating profit of $106.3 million, or
20 cents a share, an increase of 27% from the fourth quarter of 2000.
Revenue at the South San Francisco biotechnology company increased to
$600.2 million from $485.3 million, exceeding analysts' forecasts of
$227 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. reported that net income fell to
$14.2 million, or 57 cents a share, from $76.5 million, or $2.83 a
share, a year ago. Revenue at the Valencia-based real estate company
fell 72% to $76.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. said net income rose 29% to $25.9
million, or 94 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, as
revenue grew 11% to $1.03 billion.</TE>

<HD>Plunging Dow Forces Wall St. Reassessment</HD>
<DH>Markets: Negative earnings reports contribute to 211-point
drop, taking a toll on the rosy outlook that had been gaining steam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market tumbled Wednesday amid growing fears that an
economic recovery may come later rather than sooner.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its biggest one-day
decline since Oct. 29, falling 211.88 points, or 2.1%, to 9,712.27.
That left the blue-chip index at its lowest level since late
November.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite plunged 56.47 points, or 2.8%, to 1,944.44,
its largest loss since Dec. 20.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street's slump in recent days has been mirrored on stock
exchanges worldwide, leaving nearly every major market with losses in
the new year--on top of back-to-back declines in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   As fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports begin to dominate the
headlines, analysts say more investors may be waking up to the
possibility that the economy won't stage a meaningful recovery until
the second half of 2002, and perhaps not until 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a different kind of recession, and the recovery is likely
to be different too. It's going to take time," said Chuck Hill,
research chief at earnings tracker Thomson Financial/First Call in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Recessions historically have been caused when demand for goods and
services has exceeded supply, fueling inflation and higher interest
rates. This time the recession began in the business sector after the
1990s capital spending boom left many industries saturated with
competitors--and desperately seeking customers.</TE>
<TE>   Computer chip giant Intel Corp. set a worrisome tone Tuesday when
it reported a 77% drop in fourth-quarter earnings and sounded
cautious about its near-term outlook. The company also said it will
slash capital spending 25% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Intel fell 97 cents to $33.71 on Wednesday and helped trigger
deeper declines in many other tech stocks--particularly those of
companies that may be hurt by Intel's reduced spending. Among makers
of chip-manufacturing equipment, Applied Materials sank $4.06 to
$41.55 and KLA-Tencor dived $5.30 to $50.01.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and on Nasdaq, as trading volume rose.</TE>
<TE>   Along with technology, shares of brokerage, energy and heavy-
industry companies were sharply lower. In the Dow, 3M slumped $6.03
to $103.47 and United Technologies dropped $2.07 to $59.05.</TE>
<TE>   New data Wednesday pointed to an economy still in decline in
December, although the rate of descent may have slowed. The Federal
Reserve's index of industrial production eased 0.1% for the month.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Fed officials have in recent weeks warned that the economy
may struggle for some time, even if the recession that began last
spring has ended. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a speech Friday,
emphasized that he saw significant risks to the economy in the near
term. His comments have helped drive share prices lower in recent
days, many analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the stock market is that it got ahead of itself,
some say: Share prices rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter,
anticipating an economic recovery. Many stocks, particularly in the
technology sector, are trading at high price-to-earnings ratios even
based on best-case earnings estimates for 2002 and 2003, analysts
note.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares, for example, have risen 75% since Sept. 21 and are
priced at about 34 times the $1 a share that analysts, on average,
expect the company to earn in 2003, assuming the economy revives.
That price-to-earnings ratio is about twice the company's expected
annualized profit growth rate over the next five years, according to
earnings tracker Zacks Investment Research.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts warn against reading too much into the
market's latest pullback, given the fourth-quarter surge.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically after recoveries from bear markets you get a period of
consolidation" before the next big move up, said Arnold Kaufman,
editor of Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook investment newsletter in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the economy won't start a meaningful recovery until
summer, he said, "I don't think that justifies a [sharp] pullback in
the market now."</TE>
<TE>   And although tech stock valuations may be high, he said, the
average non-tech blue-chip stock may be selling for closer to 15
times estimated 2002 earnings per share--near the historical average.</TE>
<TE>   "People are nervous, and they should be" after two years of losses
on Wall Street, Kaufman said. "But I think you have to grit your
teeth and buy" if you believe the recession is over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as John McGinley, editor of the Technical Trends
market newsletter in Wilton, Conn., warn that the key stock indexes
could revisit their three-year lows reached in September. He
questions whether many investors simply are too optimistic about the
economic and market outlooks, in the face of challenges that
Greenspan himself cites as "significant."</TE>
<TE>   A weekly poll of investment newsletters by Investors Intelligence
shows the percentage of newsletter editors who are bullish has risen
to about 52%, from 34% in September.</TE>
<TE>   That poll often has proved to be a "contrarian" indicator--meaning
that when the bulls move solidly into the majority, it often
foretells at least a near-term market peak.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of stocks, more investors have been plowing money into
bonds in recent weeks, driving yields lower. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note has fallen from 5.02% at year-end to 4.84% as of
Wednesday. But the Treasury market didn't benefit much Wednesday from
stocks' slide: Yields were mostly little changed.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors turned to gold: Near-term gold futures prices in
New York gained $2.90 to $287.30 an ounce. Gold has risen from
$278.70 at year-end.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government plans to proceed with an experimental meat inspection
system despite test results that showed some plants had more problems
with contaminated products than before.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new system, federal inspectors no longer do hand checks
of carcasses, leaving that job to company employees. The inspectors
are supposed to spend more time monitoring sanitation equipment,
overseeing plant workers and sampling products for contamination.</LD>
<LD>   Five of 11 chicken-processing plants participating in the program
had higher rates of salmonella contamination than they had before,
according to a report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.</LD>
<TE>   Test results also showed higher rates of defects such as bruises
on chickens produced by many of the 11 plants, the GAO said,
disputing assertions by the Agriculture Department that the program
had resulted in safer products.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former chief financial officer of Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.
settled insider trading charges involving his purchase of 5,000
Tricon shares in August 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Robert C. Lowes, whose former firm owns hundreds of Pizza Hut,
KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food restaurants, agreed to pay
$58,692, including $25,625 in allegedly ill-gotten gains, to settle
charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency
said.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for Lowes, a former Burger King Corp. executive who
left Tricon in June 1999, wasn't available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Lowes, a 56-year-old California resident, bought about 5,000
shares of Tricon common stock on Aug. 17, 1998, with advance
knowledge of improved financial projections for the company, the SEC
alleged. The company disclosed the improved results two days later.
Lowes profited $25,625 on the trade, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowes neither admitted nor denied the SEC's charges.</TE>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aon Corp., the No. 2 insurance broker, said fourth-quarter revenue
will be reduced by $70million because of declines in the value of
limited partnership investments held by its insurance underwriting
units.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based Aon also said it sold $450 million of the limited
partnership investments by packaging them into securities. The sale
will smooth the income stream from the underwriting unit, which will
be spun off later this year, Aon said.</LD>
<LD>   The $70-million reduction in revenue will affect earnings, said
spokesman Sean O'Neill, though he declined to say by how much.</LD>
<TE>   The company will release fourth-quarter and full-year results Feb.
12. Aon is expected to earn 47 cents a share in the fourth quarter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three groups of female Boeing Co. employees filed federal lawsuits
against the aerospace giant alleging gender discrimination, several
months after a similar suit in Seattle was granted class-action
status.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits were filed in federal courts in California, Kansas

be certified as class actions.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits allege Boeing denied women promotions, equal pay and
other employment opportunities because of their gender.</LD>
<TE>   Ken Mercer, a spokesman for Boeing in Chicago, said the company is
reviewing the lawsuits and had no immediate comment.</TE>

million, or 10 cents a share, to pay for closing claim offices and
redesigning its customer information centers. The Northbrook,
Ill.-based insurer estimates it will save $140 million a year before
taxes, once the changes are completed.</LD>
<LD>   Allstate also said it reserved $38 million, or 5 cents a share, in
the fourth quarter for a settlement with Georgia auto policyholders.
The insurer said it is continuing to litigate similar suits in other
states.</LD>
<TE>   Allstate shares fell 37 cents to close at $32.65 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federated Department Stores Inc. said it will close its Fingerhut
catalog business, which it bought in 1999 for $1.7billion.</LD>
<LD>   The business employs about 6,000 people, mostly in Minnesota. It's
unlikely a buyer will be found, said Federated, owner of the
Bloomingdale's, Lazarus, Macy's and Rich's chains.</LD>
<LD>   The company restructured Fingerhut, the second-largest U.S.
catalog business, in 2000 after the Internet industry slumped and a
rising number of catalog customers became delinquent in paying off
their charge-card balances.</LD>
<TE>   Federated shares fell $1.13 to $40.74 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The news was reported after the close of regular U.S.
markets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An internal review has found the Treasury Department's accidental
leak of its market-sensitive announcement on the 30-year bond last
fall was worse than initially disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   According to a Treasury inspector general's report, the news
release regarding the suspension of issuance of the 30-year bond
appeared on a Treasury Web site at 9:43 a.m. EST on Oct 31.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-minute gap between the Web posting and the slated 10 a.m.
embargo time was larger than previously disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   In any case the news had leaked out even before Treasury's Web
foul-up. A member of the Treasury's debt advisory panel and a
principal at a New Jersey analysis firm had said they had heard about
the news before the official release.</TE>

<HD>Output Dips for 5th Month in a Row</HD>
<DH>Economy: Drop in consumer price index adds fuel to
speculation of another Fed rate cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAREN BOHAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. industrial output shrank for a fifth straight month in December
and consumer prices fell, according to two reports Wednesday that
highlighted the U.S. economy's fragility.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve's closely watched gauge of industrial
production dropped 0.1% in December, after a 0.4% decline in
November.</LD>
<LD>   The latest drop capped a year in which industrial output plunged
3.9%, the biggest fall since 1982.</LD>
<TE>   A separate report from the Labor Department showed a 0.2% drop in
U.S. consumer prices, which was led by plummeting energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding food and energy, the closely watched core consumer price
index rose 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   "If we add up all the statistics we've gotten recently, they are
still reflecting the economy was in a recession in December," said
Brian Fabbri, chief economist at BNP Paribas in New York. "The
outlook ... is the production side of the economy will probably start
to improve in the first half of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The two economic reports bolstered already widespread expectations
for a cut of a quarter of a percentage point in short-term interest
rates when the Federal Reserve meets Jan. 29 and 30.</TE>
<TE>   Although some data trickling in have offered hope, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan has warned that dangers remain and it is too soon to
feel confident about a return to steady growth.</TE>
<TE>   The data offered a reminder of the weaknesses that still exists.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses in December ran at 74.4% of capacity, down from 74.5%
in November and the lowest level since April 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The 0.1% drop in industrial output contrasted with economists'
expectations for an unchanged reading from November.</TE>
<TE>   The report contained a few hints of strength, mostly in the auto
and high-tech sectors. Auto production rose for a second straight
month to a 12.33-million-unit annual rate. Economists were not
surprised to see that inflation is soft.</TE>
<TE>   During all of 2001, the CPI was up only 1.6%, the smallest gain
since a 1.6% rise in 1998. The core CPI rose 2.7% last year.</TE>

<HD>Gates Urges Top Priority for Product Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said in a rare companywide memo
that employees need to make increasing the security of the firm's
products their top priority.</LD>
<LD>   The memo e-mailed Tuesday substantially raises the internal
profile of security issues, an area in which Microsoft has faced
mounting criticism from customers, analysts and even national
politicians.</LD>
<LD>   "If we don't do this, people simply won't be willing--or able--to
take advantage of all the other great work we do. Trustworthy
computing is the highest priority," Gates wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Gates compared the significance of the communique to his earlier
sweeping strategic calls to embrace the Internet and to move toward a
vision of software as a service.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to security breaches, viruses and attacks in Windows and
other operating systems, Gates said Microsoft has done a good job in
responding quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "But as an industry leader we can and must do better," he said.
"Our new design approaches need to dramatically reduce the number of
such issues that come up."</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, a gaping hole was found in Microsoft's newest
operating system, Windows XP, that could allow hackers to take
control of a PC through the Internet. The discovery brought a rare
FBI warning to the general public. And a flaw in its Internet browser
was found to expose data on a PC.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is crucial for Microsoft because it needs more consumer
confidence to establish a bigger market for Web services. It also
wants to sell more to businesses, which are making software buying
decisions based on security.</TE>
<TE>   And the company is beginning to lose political capital as well.
Last week, a panel of technology experts assembled by the National
Academy of Sciences said lawmakers should consider ending software
companies' special protection from product liability lawsuits. Rep.
Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who co-chairs the Congressional Internet
Caucus, said last week that he is looking into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Gates made clear in the memo that the company should jettison new
features in products if including them would mean decreasing
security.</TE>

<LD>Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett ramped up his
campaign against the $24-billion acquisition of Compaq Computer
Corp., sending letters to more than 750,000 stockholders and asking
them to veto the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett, who plans a proxy fight with HP management over the
Compaq deal, said he does not want HP merely to maintain the status
quo, but rather to "change and grow organically, with targeted
tactical acquisitions."</LD>
<LD>   Palo Alto-based HP fell 66 cents to $22.42 and Houston-based
Compaq, which announced fourth-quarter results, slid 30 cents to
$11.10, both on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>SEC Alleges Trump Firm Misled Investors</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Hotel company settles dispute over 1999 pro forma
accounting. It is first such case for regulator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. was charged Wednesday in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's first case that alleges
investors were misled by an earnings report that didn't follow U.S.
accounting standards.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators said the third quarter 1999 earnings release from the
Atlantic City, N.J., company, headed by real estate mogul Donald
Trump, did not disclose that a higher-than-expected pro forma profit
was mainly because of a one-time gain rather than from operating
performance.</LD>
<LD>   "The earnings release was fraudulent because it created the false
and misleading impression that the company had exceeded earnings
expectations primarily through operational improvements when in fact
it had not," an SEC statement said.</LD>
<TE>   In settling the three-year dispute, Trump Hotels did not admit or
deny the charges. The 1999 news release was issued by an executive
who is no longer with the company, the firm said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Trump Hotels (ticker symbol: DJT), which was not fined, said it
promptly corrected the matter and has had procedures in place since
1999 that guard against any officer repeating such an action.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock fell 22 cents to $1.73 on Wednesday in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Company earnings announcements that depart from generally accepted
accounting principles--and typically make profits look better--grew
more popular in the Internet stock boom of the late 1990s, when new
companies with no profit looked for ways to reassure shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The figures, which typically are referred to as pro forma results,
often exclude costs involving mergers, noncash compensation and
research and development.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC warned investors in December that pro forma results can
differ dramatically from a company's official financial statements
and threatened to sue companies that issue misleading results.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo Tops Forecast; Analysts Yawn</HD>
<DH>Internet: Experts say the mildly upbeat news on earnings,
still down 39% from last year, isn't enough to lift sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Online bellwether Yahoo Inc. beat Wall Street's expectations for its
quarterly earnings Wednesday. But analysts said the modest upside
doesn't foreshadow a recovery for the beleaguered Internet sector.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo's pro forma profit of $17 million, or 3 cents per share,
topped the consensus of 1 cent from analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial.</LD>
<LD>   Yahoo's revenue still slid 39% compared to a year earlier, coming
in at $189 million. But the figure exceeded the company's earlier
guidance of $160 million to $180 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We definitely see the year 2002 as a growth year for Yahoo,"
Terry Semel, chief executive, said in an interview. "We're making an
assumption that the advertising market will continue to stay flat,"
but that Yahoo will grab a larger share going forward.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts generally agreed that the company has navigated through
the worst of a disastrous period, but see improvements coming slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "Yahoo's keeping its head above water in a very difficult market,"
said Fred Moran of Jeffries &amp; Co. "But when you factor in their
guidance, we can't expect a recovery and growth any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   In the same period a year earlier, Yahoo earned $80 million, or 13
cents per share pro forma, on revenue of $311 million. Counting
one-time factors, Yahoo lost $9 million, or 2 cents per share, the
last quarter, compared with a loss of $98 million, or 17 cents per
share, a year before.</TE>
<TE>   The company also announced the widely expected departure of
President Jeff Mallett, who had been passed over for the top job when
Hollywood veteran Semel was brought in last spring.</TE>
<TE>   During the last year Yahoo has tried to wean itself from
dependence on the lagging ad market. In November it announced a
partnership with SBC Communications Inc. to offer high-speed Internet
access services. Also in November, Yahoo added paid listings for its
search-engine results.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the company agreed to acquire HotJobs, a leading
fee-based, job-listing Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have rewarded the approach. The company's stock has more
than doubled since September.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo shares fell $1.60, or more than 8%, to $17.87 in regular
Nasdaq trading Wednesday; the stock climbed 14 cents to $18.01 in
after-hours trading following the earnings announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Ads and marketing services still account for 72% of the company's
revenue--one reason that some analysts view the firm as overvalued
compared with other Internet and media companies.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts applauded Yahoo for apparently having stabilized
revenue after more than a year of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   They said the company may even return to modest growth in 2002 as
its new strategies begin to bear fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "Strategically, the company is positioned better today than it had
been at any point in 2001," said John Corcoran, an analyst with CIBC
World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   But he cautioned that progress will be incremental until the ad
market picks up, perhaps late this year.</TE>

<HD>BEARS WALKING on Air</HD>
<DH>In Chicago, Nothing Matches the Residents' Affections for
Their Beloved Football Team, Not Even the Return of Jordan to Face
the Bulls</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>In order to understand how any sporting event could possibly be
larger than Michael Jordan's return to his former home arena, you
must first know this: The Superfans who filled those "Saturday Night
Live" skits with Chicago sports references were not fictitious. Such
people actually exist. In mass quantities.</LD>
<LD>   From that point, remember this: Their primary allegiance, the
first object of their affection on their initial appearance, was Da
Bears.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Bears have a home playoff game for the first time in 11
years, one that happens to start 31/2 hours after Jordan and the
Washington Wizards tip off against the Chicago Bulls at the United
Center on Saturday afternoon. But that little bit of
made-for-television scheduling is the only time the Bears come after
Jordan this week.</LD>
<TE>   The breakdown of conversation topics--in the media, the bars and
the barbershops--goes (1) Bears; (2) Philadelphia Eagle quarterback
Donovan McNabb, a Chicago native, comes home to play the Bears; (3)
How will the Bears stop McNabb? (4) The last time the Eagles and
Bears played at Soldier Field, in the infamous Fog Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   You want a true-blue (and orange) Chicago sports fan? Check out
Bill McClaren. McClaren, 42, was at the Bull-Hornet game Tuesday
night with his 9-year-old son Nick. Bill wore a 1993 NBA Finals cap
and a Bear jersey. It was No. 41. That's Brian Piccolo. This man is
old school.</TE>
<TE>   His dad had Bears' season tickets since 1946 and Bill's been going
to games since 1966. And he'll be at Soldier Field on Saturday, to
see Da Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "They are Chicago," McClaren said. "As much as Jordan meant, I'd
take one Bears' Super Bowl over all six basketball championships. I
think football is just the fabric of our town. Nothing against
basketball, but the Bears are everybody's team."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears are older, their ties to the city are deeper, their
names more legendary. Halas, Butkus, Payton.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between the Bulls and the Bears is like the
difference between something you bought and something you inherited.
And since the NFL schedule-makers all but forced fans who want to be
there into an either-or decision, they are voting for the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a mixed blessing for ticket brokers, who had scooped up
ducats for what Gold Coast Tickets owner Max Waisvisz said was
"supposed to be one of the bigger sporting events in Chicago
history"--the Jordan game.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Bears made the playoffs, and Waisvisz can't get rid of
courtside seats he bought for $1,000 and a suite for which he paid
$15,000. Bear tickets with a face value of $50 to $80 are going for
$200 to $600.</TE>
<TE>   "Bears' tickets are selling great," Waisvisz said. "We're having a
slow time with Michael Jordan's return."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps by the time the weekend rolls around, talk will get to
Jordan. But in this sporting feast he's become the appetizer. Or
maybe a side dish.</TE>
<TE>   He was the man who gave this town sustenance throughout the 1990s,
bringing six NBA championships and worldwide acclaim to Chicago. The
game's greatest player called this city home. For a town that always
had a bit of an attitude because it wasn't quite as big-time as New
York or as glamorous as L.A., that meant more than any other civic
bragging point.</TE>
<TE>   My time in Chicago spanned 1988-1994. In other words, I arrived
21/2 years after the Bears won the Super Bowl and left a year after
the Bulls' first three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   When I first got here, I couldn't help but notice this town's
obsession with the Bears. Team apparel everywhere. It seemed as if
every player had a promotional appearance on Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   The day after they made a stirring comeback against the New York
Jets on "Monday Night Football," a TV station interviewed a group of
nuns, who agreed the victory was nothing short of miraculous. Nuns.</TE>
<TE>   All of those Bear jackets, scarves and gloves gradually gave way
to Bull championship T-shirts and caps.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls were winning, the Bears were losing and worst of all, Da
Coach, Mike Ditka, was fired. The team lost its identity. Soldier
Field's fabled columns might as well have crumbled into Lake
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Media coverage tilted toward the Bulls, reaching its absurd peak
when television news helicopters followed the team bus up I-94 to
Milwaukee for live coverage of the Bulls on their way to set the NBA
record for single-season victories in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But when Jordan left two years later, so did the interest. It
ought to tell you something that when the Lakers--featuring two
superstars, former Bull coach Phil Jackson and the best record in the
league--played the Bulls last Saturday, neither the Chicago Tribune
nor the Chicago Sun-Times sent a columnist to the game. They were
busy focusing on the Philadelphia-Tampa Bay game to get a handle on
the Bears' next opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Bear linebacker Brian Urlacher's No. 54 has replaced Jordan's No.
23 as the must-have jersey.</TE>
<TE>   I even saw an African American wearing an Urlacher jersey the
other day. How often do you see a brother wearing a white player's
jersey? That's love.</TE>
<TE>   To outsiders, it might seem like the renewed mania for the Bears
(prime example: an orange-and-blue wedding dress with "Bears"
stitched across the halter top pictured in the Sun-Times) is a sign
of dementia. In reality, it shows that life in Chicago is returning
to normal.</TE>

<HD>Injury Leaves Roddick Down Under and Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>The sight of Andy Roddick limping off the court at Grand Slam
tournaments is becoming a well-worn image.</LD>
<LD>   You could call him the King of Pain, but here at the all-injured
Australian Open, there is plenty of competition.</LD>
<LD>   Roddick, who already hurt his right ankle in his opening match,
re-injured the same one again in a serious-looking tumble against
Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia today in their first set tiebreaker.</LD>
<TE>   The 13th-seeded Roddick lost the tiebreaker, 13-11, and was having
major difficulty moving in the second. On the final changeover,
instead of sitting, he shook hands with Ljubicic and withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   Roddick maintained his composure, signing autographs as he left
Vodafone Arena. But tears flowed as the 19-year-old headed to the
locker room, and Roddick was said to be disconsolate. One official
likened the locker room to "a morgue."</TE>
<TE>   Ljubicic, who advanced, 7-6 (11), 3-2, reached the third round of
a Grand Slam for the first time. Not long after the Roddick drama
unfolded, No. 8 Pete Sampras found himself in the midst of a
difficult second-round test against Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina,
winning 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, in Rod Laver Arena. Chela fought back,
winning the third, 6-3, in 31 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With Roddick's departure, there are four American men
remaining--qualifier Alex Kim, wild-card entrant Taylor Dent, veteran
Todd Martin and Sampras.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty crushing," Roddick said. "It's happened a little too
much and it's just really disheartening. I sprained my ankle the
first night and I was able to play through on adrenaline. I had it
taped almost like a cast, it affected my movement. Then I did it
again. I asked the trainer to come out. He said, 'If your ankle is so
weak, it's turning in that thing, there's risk of long-term damage if
you play again.'"</TE>
<TE>   Roddick said he has sprained his ankles several times through the
last six months. At the French Open last year in the third round, he
had a hard fall on the clay and was forced to retire in the third set
against Lleyton Hewitt with a strained left hamstring. Before the
Hewitt match, he had severe cramps against Michael Chang but managed
to win.</TE>
<TE>   Now, adding to his frustration is the fact that he worked hard
during the off-season on his physical conditioning only to have his
ankle give way twice in two matches.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm sick of it, fed up," he said. "I want to find a long-term
solution.... I'm really running out of answers. I'm as confused as
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Ljubicic said he was surprised Roddick retired and told him he was
sorry about his difficulties when they shook hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he is gonna be OK," he said. "Again, he fell on the same
ankle. When you do something twice it can be very bad. We know
physically that he's very fragile. Unfortunately, he has a lot of
problems, but that's tennis, these days, if you see how many players
are calling the trainer these days, it's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The tumble came at a time when the level of shot-making hit a high
point in the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   Neither player double-faulted before the tiebreaker. Ljubicic
fought off three break points, and Roddick did not face a single
break point. Roddick went down on his own set point, his third, as he
ran wide for a forehand and the ankle gave way.</TE>
<TE>   As he hit the court, Roddick grabbed at his ankle, tumbling on the
often-sticky Rebound Ace surface. He took time to compose himself at
the back of the court and had enough to fight off three set points
before Ljubicic took it with a backhand winner to grab the 49-minute
set.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was one of my best matches," he said. "I was very
aggressive from the beginning, I wasn't expecting he wasn't going to
finish the match. I think I played a very good first set, and a good
start in the second. I didn't expect he was going to give up. I was
really sorry because it was becoming a nice match. I'm sure we're
going to play a lot more matches because we're both young guys."</TE>
<TE>   The immediate future is uncertain for Roddick. He will have the
ankle examined here and then later at home in Florida. His appearance
against Slovakia early next month in the first round of the Davis Cup
would have to be considered questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the short-term and larger implications, Roddick managed to
make a wry joke at his own expense when he spoke about how he has
sprained his ankles.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to divide it between the two," he said. "One gets jealous,
so I have to sprain the other one."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Erstad, Angels Agree on Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna,</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel center fielder Darin Erstad, nearly traded to the Chicago White
Sox in December, agreed to terms on a one-year, $6.25-million
contract Wednesday, a lucrative deal that avoids arbitration and
could increase the chances of Erstad remaining in Anaheim beyond this
coming season.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad, who can become a free agent after 2002, received a
considerable raise over the $3.45 million he made in 2001, when he
suffered through a mediocre, injury-plagued season batting .258 with
nine home runs and 63 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   "Rick Schlesinger [Angel vice president for business and legal
affairs] made it clear he wanted to have discussion about a multiyear
deal later this year, and we agreed to do that," said Jeff Moorad,
Erstad's agent. "We're pleased with the result [of Wednesday's deal].
It's obvious the Angels were committed to getting something done that
was fair for Darin."</LD>
<TE>   Erstad had a tremendous 2000 season, batting .355 with 25 homers,
39 doubles, 100 RBIs and a franchise-record 121 runs and 240 hits,
but after slumping in 2001, he wasn't sure what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between Moorad and the Angels on a long-term deal broke down
quickly after the season, and the sides agreed to pursue a one-year
deal. Erstad was pleasantly surprised by the results.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to know they still think highly of me," Erstad said.
"Hopefully I can reward them."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad moved from center field to first base for the final week of
the 2001 season, in anticipation of a possible move back to the
infield for 2002. But it appears Erstad will remain in the outfield.</TE>
<TE>   That means barring a trade or free-agent acquisition, Scott
Spiezio will probably play first, with Shawn Wooten seeing some time
at first base and designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told, more than likely, that I'll play center field,"
Erstad said. "I'm preparing to play the outfield.''</TE>
<TE>   Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii looks forward to closing a
deal with the Dodgers as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really enthusiastic," Ishii said after returning to Japan
from a Yakult Swallows' training camp in Hawaii. "The team I want to
join the most made the highest bid for me so of course I'm pleased."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers reportedly made a formal contract offer late Monday in
an attempt to sign the 28-year-old Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Bret Boone, who helped lead the Seattle Mariners to
an American League-record 116 wins last season, agreed to a
$25-million, three-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   The deal contains a team option for 2005 that would become
guaranteed if he has about 400 plate appearances the previous year.
The contract would be worth $33 million over four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Boone, 32, finished third in the league MVP voting last year when
he set AL records for second basemen in home runs and runs batted in.
He hit .331 with 36 homers and 141 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Jermaine Dye avoided arbitration by agreeing to a
$32-million, three-year contract with the Oakland Athletics. Dye,
acquired from Kansas City by the A's in a July trade, filed for
arbitration Tuesday and could have become a free agent after next
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins, facing an uncertain future, locked up another
promising player for the long term by signing pitcher Joe Mays to a
four-year contract worth $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic," said Mays, who had a breakthrough season in 2001,
going 17-13 with a 3.16 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The signing of Mays is another indication the Twins, who finished
a surprising 85-77 and in second place in the AL Central last year,
are preparing to play this season, despite the possibility of the
franchise being eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free agent pitcher Pedro Astacio, shut down late last season by
the Houston Astros because of an injured right shoulder, agreed on a
one-year deal with the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Astacio is guaranteed $5 million, and can make an additional $5
million next season in performance bonuses if he pitches 230 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Brewers signed free agent second baseman Eric Young
to a $5-million, two-year contract. Young gets $2 million in each of
the next two seasons, and Milwaukee has a $3-million option for 2004
with a $1-million buyout.</TE>
<TE>   Young batted .279 with six home runs, 42 RBIs and 31 stolen bases
last season for the Chicago Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder J.D. Drew avoided arbitration, agreeing to a one-year,
$3.1-million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.... Right-hander
reliever Danny Patterson and the Detroit Tigers agreed to a
$7-million, three-year contract.... Catcher Scott Servais signed a
minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.... The Chicago
Cubs and Alan Benes agreed on a minor league contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox agreed to a one-year contract worth $650,000
with catcher Doug Mirabelli, avoiding arbitration.... The Pittsburgh
Pirates signed right-hander Scott Service to a minor league contract.</TE>

<HD>Juan Out of Four Not Bad vs. Duke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They went four rounds last season, Duke and Maryland, trading punches
all the way to the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   Duke won three times, frustrating the Terrapins at almost every
turn.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Dixon won the other.</LD>
<TE>   The Blue Devils took the overtime thriller at Cole Field House,
coming from 10 points behind in the final minute of regulation to
beat Maryland by two after Jason Williams helped force overtime by
scoring eight points in 13 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   In the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, Duke beat Maryland by
two on Nate James' tip-in of Williams' miss with 1.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Most famously, Duke came from an astounding 22 points behind in a
national semifinal to win by 11 and go on to defeat Arizona for the
national championship two days later. (That one hurt so badly
Maryland Coach Gary Williams didn't even watch the tape until this
season.)</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's only victory came at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium,
where the Terrapins have beaten Duke two years in a row and Dixon has
made a habit of making himself at home.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon will try to make it one more memorable night in his final
visit to Cameron tonight as the third-ranked Terrapins meet No. 1
Duke for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon scored 28 points and had five steals in Maryland's 91-80
victory last season.</TE>
<TE>   The season before, he scored 31 at Cameron, making 14 of 19 shots,
and added three steals in another Maryland victory.</TE>
<TE>   Both times, he outplayed Williams on his home court.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew in previous years that I had to feed off the crowd to play
well, and we definitely did that as a team," Dixon said. "It is a lot
of fun to play down there."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the same conference as Williams, the presumed national
player of the year, Dixon has to play second fiddle, as he should.
(He's second in scoring at 19.3 points a game to Williams' 21.0)</TE>
<TE>   Once known more for overcoming an unimaginable family
tragedy--both parents died of AIDS contracted by injecting drugs with
dirty needles--he is now better known for his game.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Juan Dixon," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "I think
during his four years he has been one of the truly remarkable players
in our conference. He's a warrior, a big-time player. I love the way
he plays and competes."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech got a taste of that Sunday, when the Yellow Jackets
rallied, making a steal that gave them the chance to try to tie the
score in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   But as Tony Akins dribbled near halfcourt, Dixon displayed the
savvy that has made him the ACC steals leader three seasons in a row,
baiting Akins into switching to his left hand before stealing the
ball from behind.</TE>
<TE>   The athletic Chris Wilcox sprinted out and Dixon hit him with a
long alley-oop pass for a dunk that helped seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't win that game without Juan Dixon," said Williams, the
Maryland coach. "It's not just his offense. I think he is one of the
best players I've ever coached in terms of anticipating passes,
getting into passing lanes."</TE>
<TE>   The Duke players know all about Dixon's thievery.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, they don't want to let him steal another one from
them at home.</TE>
<TE>   It's Over</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's run has come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-game home-court winning streak fell against Wisconsin
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The 72 weeks in the top 25 ended too.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans are 1-3 in the Big Ten after a victory over Purdue on
Wednesday, making a fifth consecutive conference title an extreme
longshot.</TE>
<TE>   And after three consecutive Final Fours, the Spartans (10-7) will
have to scramble to make the NCAA tournament this season.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem too much to blame a freshman, but guard Kelvin
Torbert has not been what the Spartans expected.</TE>
<TE>   The latest "Flintstone" to play for Michigan State, Torbert was
considered perhaps the top high school player in the country last
season--with competition from Dajuan Wagner of Memphis. But Torbert
isn't even among the top five freshman scorers in the Big Ten,
averaging only nine points.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tom Izzo even benched him to start the second half against
Indiana, and is openly asking Torbert to be more aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State's problems started before Torbert arrived, though,
with the early departures of freshman Zach Randolph and sophomore
Jason Richardson to the NBA. The Spartans also lost five seniors,
among them stalwarts Charlie Bell and Andre Hutson.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise the Spartans will have to wait till next year.</TE>
<TE>   One person, though, seemed particularly unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   Izzo's 7-year-old daughter, Raquel, was in tears after Michigan
State lost at home.</TE>
<TE>   "She wasn't old enough to remember what a loss was," Izzo told the
Detroit Free Press.</TE>
<TE>   The Spartans' last loss in the Breslin Center: March 1, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   And Bear in Mind ...</TE>
<TE>   After losing point guard Kenny Satterfield early to the NBA,
Cincinnati entered the season unranked for only the second time in 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bearcats have risen to No. 7 on the strength of a 16-game
winning streak, a group of veterans, and most of all, guard Steve
Logan.</TE>
<TE>   Logan started his career as a point guard, then nearly transferred
after Satterfield beat him out for the position.</TE>
<TE>   Logan stayed, and Cincinnati reached the Sweet 16 last season with
Logan at shooting guard.</TE>
<TE>   Then Satterfield left after his sophomore season, and Logan became
the point guard again--proving his scoring mettle with a 40-point
game against Mississippi State last month.</TE>
<TE>   "He came to us basically a stand-still shooter--and probably an
overweight stand-still shooter," Coach Bob Huggins said. "He's done a
great job with his body. He's down to 8% body fat and has lost 22
pounds since he enrolled here.</TE>
<TE>   "He can break people down off the dribble. He can create his own
shot, or create shots for other people. And when teams have taken one
guy to try to stop him lately, he's been very unselfish passing to
other guys."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one of the problems with Cincinnati is judging just how
good the Bearcats are.</TE>
<TE>   They lost to Oklahoma State, the only team they've played that's
currently in the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   The only top 25 opponent remaining on their schedule: Wake Forest
on Feb. 9.</TE>

<HD>Mickelson Puts Concerns to Rest</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>Here's another reason why it's nice to be a pro golfer: a five-month
vacation. That's a pretty fine work break for anyone, and Phil
Mickelson enjoyed his near half-year away from the rigors of big-time
tournament golf so much, he didn't even miss his job until a month
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Mickelson played a PGA Tour event was late August at
the NEC Invitational. So when he showed up to play his first
competitive round Wednesday at the Bob Hope, he would be so rusty he
would creak, right?</LD>
<LD>   Mickelson shot an eight-under 64 at Tamarisk, nine birdies and a
bogey. He was so unprepared to play that he birdied the first four
holes. He also birdied the last two, thus starting fast, ending fast
and announcing his comeback in a very big way.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just excited to be back out playing golf again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, who wouldn't be with a score like that?</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who would have played in the Ryder Cup in late
September if not for the events of Sept. 11, decided to forget about
tournament golf after that so he could be with his wife, Amy, and
enjoy the birth of their second child. Sophia Isabel was born Oct.
23.</TE>
<TE>   The last two weeks, Mickelson has been working on his game at the
Titleist test center in Carlsbad, especially his short game, or from
150 yards in. He is carrying a fourth wedge because he thinks that's
going to come in handy in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Last year was not Mickelson's best year, but it might have been
his most consistent. He won twice (he won four times in 1996 and
again in 2000) and he was No. 2 on the money list. But he also had 13
top-10 finishes, three of them in the majors--at the Masters, the U.S

<TE>   He has not won a major, and while that's clearly on his wish list,
Mickelson said he isn't going public with any goals this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to keep those personal. The last time I shared my
mind-set heading into a tournament was at the PGA and it didn't go
over well. It didn't come across that well. I guess it wasn't printed
that well."</TE>
<TE>   What Mickelson said at the PGA was that he wasn't thinking about
only winning a major, but by how many shots he wanted to win. And
he's right. It didn't come across that well.</TE>
<TE>   He has four chances this year to win as many majors by as much as
he can.</TE>

<TE>   No, not a legal ERC II driver, but legal ERC fairway woods. The
woods conform to USGA specifications because it has decided that
clubs with lofts higher than 15 degrees are not considered driving

<HD>Gonzalez's Milestone Is a Winning Attitude</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Juan Gonzalez of Culver City High scored two goals Wednesday in an
8-2 victory over visiting Inglewood Morningside, raising his career
total to 101, but joining the exclusive century club is not the
senior's biggest accomplishment this season.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez became only the 10th Southern Section player to have
found the net 100 times during his career, according to section
records, but his on-field demeanor is where he has made the biggest
strides this season.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez, a four-year starter, had 24 goals as a junior but had to
sit out the last 12 games of the season after receiving his third red
card. He had received only one yellow card this season before the
Morningside game while tallying 26 goals and 11 assists.</LD>
<TE>   Rules stipulate that a player sit out one game after being issued
his first red card, two games for a second and the remainder of the
season for a third.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez knew the rules but still received his third red card in
the second league game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was used to playing club soccer and winning a lot," Gonzalez
said. "I'm a sore loser and I couldn't handle the fact that we were
losing a lot last season."</TE>
<TE>   Culver City was 11-14-1 last season while being racked by
dissension, but a less-talented Centaur squad is 9-5-4 and in second
place in the league standings with a 4-1-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City has played more as a team this season and some of that
can be attributed to Gonzalez keeping his cool on the field, despite
being double- and sometimes triple-teamed.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him [after that last season] that he needed to grow up and
show some leadership," said Coach Dave Sanchez, an assistant at
Culver City the previous three years. "We needed him to maintain his
composure on the field for us to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who is being recruited by North Carolina State, San Jose
State, UC Irvine and UC Riverside, said sitting on the sidelines at
the end of last season taught him a painful, but necessary, lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't be on the bench," he said. "To me, not playing soccer is
like not breathing."</TE>
<TE>   Tale of two games: Dana Hills did everything right in a 5-0
victory against highly regarded Lake Forest El Toro on Jan. 9 but
tied less-heralded Mission Viejo, 1-1, two days later.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we shot found the corner of the net," Coach Dennis
Korinke said of the game against El Toro. "We didn't expect a big
victory.... On Friday, we just missed a lot. We didn't put a lot of
shots on goal when we had opportunities. We didn't play a complete
game."</TE>
<TE>   Overconfidence might have played a part in Dana Hills' lackluster
effort against Mission Viejo, Korinke said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys kind of start thinking, 'Hey. We're really good,'" he
said. "That sometimes is more of a distraction than it's worth."</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated coach: A 2-0 loss at Riverside Poly on Monday dropped
Santa Margarita (16-3-3) from the top 10 for the first time this
season and left Coach Curt Bauer perplexed about his team's play.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a lot going well right now and I don't know if
we're ever going to," he said of a team that has scored six goals in
its last five games. "Perhaps the lack of playing time the guys have
had together [because of several injuries] is catching up to us."</TE>

<HD>Odom's Wrist Has Become Nagging Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clipper forward Lamar Odom could be seen flexing his sprained right
wrist at almost every play stoppage during the 1-5 trip through
Philadelphia, Washington, New Jersey, Charlotte, Toronto and
Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   "It's sore," he said after the Clippers' loss Tuesday against the
Timberwolves. "It hurts. I think we'll get another MRI when we get
home."</LD>
<LD>   Odom has undergone X-rays, which have been negative. Coach Alvin
Gentry has said several times that rest is the only sure cure for
what ails Odom, but doesn't expect his most versatile player to take
time off before the end of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Odom said Tuesday almost any contact ignites the pain in his
wrist, originally injured when he fell to the floor Dec. 16 against
the Detroit Pistons. He sat out three games, but returned Jan. 2 and
hasn't been sidelined since.</TE>

<TE>   Odom on bouncing back to defeat the Raptors, the Clippers' only
victory on the trip, after squandering an eight-point lead with 1:25
left in regulation two nights earlier against the Hornets:</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to let it go. It's one of 82 games. It hurts, but
you've got to be consistent and stay focused on the next game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the overlooked statistics on the Clippers' first lengthy
trip of the season was their inability to meet their scoring average
in any of the six games.</TE>
<TE>   They were averaging more than 95 points when they left L.A.
They're at 94.6 now.</TE>
<TE>   The best they could do was a 92-point effort in a 24-point loss to
the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   They needed overtime to get to 91 points in an overtime loss to
the Hornets. They also had a season-low 79 points in a seven-point
victory over the Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' road record is a paltry 3-13, with three trips of
four games or more still left. They are 16-7 at Staples Center,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at some of the great teams of the past, they had an
us-against-the-world attitude," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   "When they went into a hostile environment, it fueled their
competitive juices and they banded together and came up with a win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's next? The Clippers play four of their next five at Staples
Center, starting with Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
They reach the midway point of their 82-game schedule Saturday
against the Trail Blazers at Portland.... The Clippers were given the
day off Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Cuban Queen for the Day</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Billionaire owner shows he can dish it out
(and take shots) behind ice cream counter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COPPELL, Texas</DL>
<LD>Trying desperately to perfect the curly tip on a soft-serve cone,
Mark Cuban licked the remains of another failed effort from his
fingertips and handed the messy treat to an excited 3-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   One lick later, the kid dropped it.</LD>
<LD>   That was about the only thing that went wrong Wednesday when the
billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks worked two hours behind a
Dairy Queen counter, making good on a promise to manage the fast-food
restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   The company's offer came in response to Cuban's assertion that he
wouldn't hire Ed Rush, the NBA's head of officiating, "to manage a
Dairy Queen."</TE>
<TE>   The league fined Cuban $500,000 for the comment, a record for an
individual. For about $650,000, Cuban could've bought a startup DQ
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   So, after doing the job himself, does he still think Rush couldn't
do it?</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on how he treats the customers. That's the hard part,"
Cuban said.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the point I was trying to make with the NBA is that you
have to understand your customers and learn to get better as a
business."</TE>
<TE>   Cuban, fined more than $1 million by the NBA in the two years
since he bought the team, praised his boss-for-a-day, store owner
Parrish Chapman, and took another shot at the league.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to send Parrish up to the NBA to have him give them a
lesson in exactly how to communicate," Cuban said. "When anybody
needed to interact with Parrish, he was right there to answer the
questions. That's the way you run a business. If Parrish just went up
there and just took a look, we'd be a lot better off."</TE>
<TE>   Cuban's presence created a carnival atmosphere at the suburban
Dairy Queen and drew more than 1,000 people, many waiting close to an
hour to place their order. The crush was so big the restaurant ran
out of ice.</TE>

<HD>Can't Mask Over This Loss</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Sabre shot goes off Shields' helmet and into the
net, setting tone for the Ducks' 3-1 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks still looked back fondly on Paul Kariya's hat trick
Monday night. They felt good about his selection to the all-star
game.</LD>
<LD>   But those good moments, as they always seem with the Ducks, were
fleeting. They couldn't mask their lack of offense, or get a kind
deflection off a mask, Wednesday. The Buffalo Sabres' 3-1 victory
before an announced 9,845 fans at the Arrowhead Pond was a tale of
two shots and another example of bad luck for the Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   Buffalo's Tim Connolly fired a shot off the mask of Duck goalie
Steve Shields. The puck went in.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks' Mike Leclerc fired a shot off the mask of Sabre goalie
Martin Biron. The puck didn't go in.</TE>
<TE>   The Sabres clung to a 2-1 lead in the third period, before J.P.
Dumont's empty-net goal with 20 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning is fun, if you're not winning, you're not having as much
fun," Kariya said. "It's important as a team that we start getting
some wins and get ourselves back into the playoff picture. That's
when we're all going to have a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Well, there was no fun Wednesday. Kariya was coming off a hat
trick in a 5-3 victory over Nashville on Monday. It was a rare
offensive performance by the Ducks and Exhibit A on why Kariya
belongs in the all-star game.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that does good things for him and he gets on a real good
roll," Coach Bryan Murray said before the game. "We can win some
games if Paul scores like that."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the Ducks can pretty much count on a victory every time
Kariya scores three goals. It's when he needs others to chip in that
they run into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Other teams find ways to put the puck in the net. The Sabres found
two in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Vaclav Varada carried the puck in from the blue line and turned
defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky around. Tverdovsky got his stick on
Varada's skate at the last second, tripping him up. But as Varada was
falling to the ice he managed to get a wrist shot off that beat
Shields to the left for a 1-0 lead 7 minutes 45 seconds into the
period.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly then skated into the Duck zone, cleared defenseman Ruslan
Salei and got off a shot that Shields had a good look at ... too good
of a look.</TE>
<TE>   The puck struck Shields in the mask and ricocheted downward into
the net for a 2-0 lead at 11:27 of the period.</TE>
<TE>   How things go against the Ducks was evident in the third period,
when Leclerc ripped a shot at Biron, hitting him in the mask. The
puck bounced back harmlessly away.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way the game goes, sometimes you don't get the
breaks," Leclerc said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks did get one break in the second period and Leclerc
cashed in.</TE>
<TE>   With the Ducks on the power play, Samuel Pahlsson made a slick
centering pass to Matt Cullen, who was bearing down on the Sabre net.
Cullen couldn't handle the pass, but he did stop the puck, leaving a
perfect tee-shot for Leclerc.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Kariya, struggling through his most frustrating season, was
selected to play for the North American team in the NHL All-Star game
Feb. 2 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya has labored as the Mighty Ducks have wallowed. He has
skated on the top line with several different players, which has
limited his production. He has 17 goals and 34 points, solid numbers,
but off his usual point production. Still, his skills were not
overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   "He is certainly one of the best players in the league," Duck
Coach Bryan Murray said. "The puck hasn't gone in as easily for him
as it might have in past years, but he has played well for this
team."</LD>
<TE>   This is Kariya's sixth All-Star game in the last seven seasons. He
missed the 1997-98 game after suffering a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Duck defenseman Ruslan Salei has been given permission to play in
one of three Olympic qualifying games for Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   Salei will play Feb. 11 against France, one of the weaker teams.
Belarus plays what may be a deciding game against Switzerland on Feb.
13, but the Ducks face Calgary that night.</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Jeff Friesen sat out Wednesday's game because of a
sprained left ankle. He said he hoped he could play at Edmonton on
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   His absence opened a spot for Timo Parssinen, recalled from minor
league Cincinnati.</TE>

<HD>Comeback Kids Brewer, Flores Boost La Mirada</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The La Mirada High girls' soccer team has rolled past two opponents
in the past week, defeating Glenn, 12-0, and Norwalk, 8-0, in
Suburban League games.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean the Matadores (13-1-3, 4-0-1 in league)
haven't experienced great comebacks. Senior goalkeeper Mayra Flores
and junior center midfielder Jennifer Brewer are each in the midst of
one.</LD>
<LD>   Flores sat out most of last season after a benign cyst that caused
her difficulty breathing was discovered near her heart. She underwent
surgery to remove it in December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought it was open-heart surgery," said Flores,
a team captain along with Brewer and senior Jennifer Aguilar. "It
wasn't. It was just near the heart. But everything went fine, thank
god."</TE>
<TE>   Flores has seven shutouts, and, on Monday, with La Mirada
comfortably ahead of Glenn, she played part of the game at left
halfback, scoring twice for her first goals of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Flores now considers her comeback complete.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed I couldn't play last year, but I didn't have
any choice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to take care of [the cyst]. It was just something that was
bothering me."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't anymore, and neither is Brewer's bad knee.</TE>
<TE>   She has returned to score a team-high 13 goals after missing last
season because of deterioration of the meniscus in her right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to cry sometimes, it hurt so bad," Brewer said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no tear in Brewer's knee joints, but wear and tear from
playing soccer year-round brought Brewer to the point where she
needed a break from the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no cure except to rest it," she said. "I could walk, but
I couldn't run or anything. I didn't play soccer for five months."</TE>
<TE>   Brewer, a member of the Olympic Development Program in the
17-and-under division, stayed involved with her La Mirada teammates
while sidelined, attending practices and serving as statistician last
season. But she's glad to be back in action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard sitting out," Brewer said.</TE>
<TE>   Flores readily agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I was anxious to get back," she said. "I really missed playing
the game, the smell of the grass, touching the ball, everything."</TE>
<TE>   Re-grouping: South Pasadena has scored goals, and stopped them, by
committee this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (12-3-1, 2-0), coming off a 3-1 victory over Monrovia
in a Rio Hondo League opener Monday, are sparked offensively by four
players.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Kristen Anderson and Ruth Apraku have 12 and 11 goals,
respectively, and Nicole Wallace and Rachel Battin have nine apiece.</TE>
<TE>   This group effort has replaced the one-girl show the defending
league-champion Tigers had last year, when they relied on Leah
Gallegos. Gallegos scored 118 goals in three seasons for South
Pasadena but transferred to Franklin High for her senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the best high school player I've seen," South Pasadena
Coach Tom Ashby said. "All the kids relied on her."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers also work together well on defense. Senior Briana Jones
and freshman Kelsey Donovan have split time at goalkeeper, with Jones
spending some time at fullback.</TE>

<HD>True to Form, Hope Reaches Low Points</HD>
<DH>PGA: Haas and Chamblee lead at nine-under 63, but that puts
them only one stroke ahead of six others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>It was business as usual on opening day at the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic, all right. It's almost as if they start the tournament with
this announcement on the first tee: "Gentlemen, start your birdies."</LD>
<LD>   Pretty soon, they're going to keep track of scores on sonar,
because they're going very low, if Wednesday's first round is any
indication. Jay Haas and Brandel Chamblee showed the way with
nine-under 63s that were barely enough for the lead since they're one
shot up on six other golfers who shot 64.</LD>
<LD>   That group at eight under includes Phil Mickelson, who hasn't
played since August but in his first competitive round in nearly five
months looked as though he had never been away.</LD>
<TE>   Chamblee is making his first start of the year after celebrating
the birthdays of his wife and son as well as his parents'
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided it was time to try and make some money instead of
spending it like I have been," Chamblee said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Haas, who won the Hope in 1988, he's 48 now, which means
he's only two years away from riding a cart on the Senior PGA Tour.
Chances are that can't be any easier a ride than the Hope has been in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about getting the ball in the hole," Haas said. "And
occasionally, I can do that still."</TE>
<TE>   Most players were getting the ball into the hole in record time,
but that's not so unusual. A score of 63 has been the first-round
lead at the Hope every year since 1997. In 1996, Mark Brooks led with
a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Opening day was a study in low scores--100 players in the field of
128 shot under par. How this happened is not much of a mystery.
Everybody knows the deal around here. Mickelson said it as well as
anyone, in an understated sort of way.</TE>
<TE>   "We know the courses here are very susceptible to birdies," he
said. And holes are round and bunkers have sand in them.</TE>
<TE>   Haas hasn't won a tournament in nine years, but he took some
putting lessons from former tour player Stan Utley last year and
started to notice that good things were beginning to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Haas said he knew something was going right at Tamarisk.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a magical day for me on the greens," he said. "I
putted about as well as I've ever putted before. I was on fire on the
greens."</TE>
<TE>   It was a common condition Wednesday. Jerry Kelly, who recorded his
64 at the Palmer Course at PGA West, said the pressure is always on
to post a low score.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a benchmark now of, what, 36 under?" Kelly said. "So
you do the math. It equals a pretty low score every day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an absolute birdie-fest. You cannot let up. You could be 30
under and lose by a lot. So you do the best you can to make every
putt."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson and Kelly, last week's winner at the Sony Open in
Hawaii, have a lot of company a shot behind Haas and Chamblee. Heath
Slocum, Glen Hnatiuk, Kirk Triplett and John Senden are all at 64.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Pavin, Mark O'Meara and Charles Howell are in a six-player
bunch at 65. It's a good start, we should all remember, because
that's what Joe Durant opened with last year on his way to the record
setting 36-under total. And speaking of records, on his way to a 65,
J.P. Hayes made eight consecutive birdies at the Palmer Course to tie
the PGA Tour record.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hayes: "Things just started falling for me."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling was contagious.</TE>

<HD>A Tangled Web Is All That's Left in Charlotte</HD>

<LD>Give David Stern's regards to Billy Graham Parkway, remember him to
that office park near the arena where visiting teams stayed, far from
downtown Charlotte, which few on the NBA circuit ever laid eyes on.</LD>
<LD>   Hello, French Quarter!</LD>
<LD>   Another of the NBA's bright lights from its 1990s glory days
flickered Wednesday when Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory announced the
Hornets, once attendance kings of the NBA, will apply to move to New
Orleans, lowering the curtain on the team's stumbling search for a
new home, not to mention its bumbling 14-season history in North
Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   Arriving as the first link to the "major leagues," playing in an
arena that would be expanded to 24,042 seats, the Hornets had a
10-year sellout streak, leading the league in attendance from 1991 to
'97. Those days are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as owners George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge fought with civic
leaders and traveled the country visiting potential venues,
attendance has dropped more than 50% from its peak, to No. 28 in a
29-team league.</TE>
<TE>   Shinn and Wooldridge never meant for that to happen, trying to
keep a low profile, swearing officials in other cities to secrecy.
However, in Louisville, Ky., each owner arrived in his corporate jet,
both of which were parked in plain sight, giving the game away and
causing the Gaston Gazette's Richard Walker to christen them "Dumb
and Dumber."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Hornets were ever much slicker.</TE>
<TE>   Admitted to the NBA in 1988, they managed to become respectable,
helped in no small part by their luck, drawing the 1991 overall No. 1
pick, Larry Johnson, and the 1992 No. 2, Alonzo Mourning.</TE>
<TE>   After that, however, came their clinic in mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, after their first playoff appearance, Shinn handed
Johnson, who was still under contract for four years, a $75-million
extension, then an unheard of figure. An incredulous Stern asked
Shinn if he realized that was more than twice what the league had
charged him for the entire franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Shinn paid no attention to Johnson's back troubles, which had
begun that summer.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Johnson would never again be the same player.</TE>
<TE>   Now strapped, Shinn would be hard-pressed to pay other players,
starting with Mourning, whose agent, David Falk, forced Shinn to
trade Mourning to Miami in 1995. Johnson went to the Knicks a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the good old days.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Hornets would lose 27 free agents in a row before
finally re-signing Jamal Mashburn last summer. (Mashburn then went
out 16 games into the season because of an abdominal muscle injury
and hasn't played since.)</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets also traded the draft rights to Kobe Bryant to the
Lakers for Vlade Divac, who would ultimately leave as a free agent.
In light of all the players who were passing through, the miracle was
that the Hornets stayed as competitive as they did.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the '90s, Shinn and his new partner, Wooldridge,
knew a cavernous arena wasn't enough if it didn't have enough luxury
suites and began entreating local officials to build a new downtown
arena.</TE>
<TE>   This didn't go over well, the old arena having opened so recently.
By this time, the Hornets were no longer the only team in town or
even the local favorite, the NFL Panthers having moved in and taken
over.</TE>
<TE>   Besides that, Shinn, who had titled his autobiography "Good
Morning, Lord!" was in a long-running civil suit with a former
employee who claimed he had sexually harassed her, although she
eventually lost in court.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, the Hornets made a surprising run, entering the
playoffs seeded No. 6 in the East, sweeping No. 3 Miami, then taking
a 3-2 lead on Milwaukee in the second round, and a 15-point lead in
Game 6 in Charlotte, before collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   Showing how poisoned the atmosphere had become, days after the
cheering stopped, voters rejected a bond initiative for a new arena
by a crashing 57% to 43%.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Stern was trying to salvage a deal in Charlotte by
bringing in new owners, since the presence of Shinn and Wooldridge
was considered the problem. But they refused to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Then came this season's tour of cities: New Orleans; Louisville;
Norfolk, Va., and, of course, the obligatory stop in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets' application to move to New Orleans will probably be
accepted, since Stern is out of ideas. He has raised no public
objection to the idea of the Hornets leaving, as he did firmly and
quickly this week with the Orlando Magic, when owner Rich DeVos
announced he'd sell the team.</TE>
<TE>   So it looks like it will soon be goodbye, Carolina. It's been, uh,
memorable.</TE>

<LD>Even without the king of the hill, today's seventh race at Santa
Anita is stakes quality.</LD>
<LD>   El Cielo, who has won nine of 12 starts at about 61/2 furlongs on
the track's unique hillside turf course, was one of four scratches
from the $60,000 classified allowance race, which originally drew 14
entrants.</LD>
<LD>   A field of 10 remains and two of them, Riviera and Malabar Gold,
also have been successful on the Santa Anita turf.</LD>
<TE>   An 8-year-old trained by Bobby Frankel for owner Ed Gann, Riviera
has won four of five down the hill and is five for six overall in
Arcadia. Idle since Sept. 10, 2000, the son of Kris has run well off
a layoff many times before.</TE>
<TE>   In his first U.S. start, back in 1998, he won by five lengths in
his first race in five months, then after more than 10 months on the
sidelines in 1999, he won here by a little more than a length as the
13-10 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Malabar Gold, a 5-year-old Unbridled horse owned by B. Wayne
Hughes, is the 5-2 favorite on the morning line. Making his first
start since last April 16 for trainer Ron Ellis, Malabar Gold has won
three of four on the course..</TE>
<TE>   The race also attracted Lake William, who won the Dayjur Handicap
on the last day of the Hollywood Park meet on Dec. 17; Auction House,
also a Frankel trainee; Morocco, who won by four lengths in his first
race at the distance on Oct. 12; Thyer's, a Brazilian horse who won
five of seven on the turf in his native land but will be making his
first start for trainer Bob Baffert, and King Slayer, who has been
1-2-3 in nine of 10 on the course.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Eddie Eddie, a 4-year-old Bertrando gelding who
broke his maiden easily on Dec. 30, is the 5-2 favorite as he tries
to stretch his speed around two turns in today's fifth. The 7-2
second choice is Vixen Storm, who was third in the California Cup
Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Trainer Mike Machowsky. Before Wednesday, he had won
with four of his first 10 starters at the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  WWW Dot Com. The 5-year-old Siyah Kalem mare, who went
0 for 14 in 2001 and is one for 32 in her career, figures to begin
the new year with another loss in today's eighth at Golden Gate
Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three, using Eddie Eddie and Vixen
Storm in the fifth, Odd Testamony, Clay Time and Watch For Smoke in
the sixth, Riviera and Malabar Gold in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/43. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10.20/$274.60. Total money bet: $274.</TE>

<HD>Modry's Efforts Are Rewarded</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three seasons ago, he played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs.Two seasons
ago, injury free, he was scratched from 55 games.</LD>
<LD>   This season, Czech defenseman Jaroslav Modry of the Kings is an
NHL all-star for the first time, named Wednesday to play for the
World Team against the North America Team Feb. 2 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   He'll be joined by his more celebrated teammate, Slovak winger
Ziggy Palffy, who will be playing in his third All-Star game.</LD>
<TE>   While Palffy might have been selected on name value alone--he has
played in little more than half of the Kings' 46 games because of
various injuries--Modry's selection was a reward for the most
productive season of his career. With 36 games still to play, Modry,
30, already has a career-high 26 points, tops among King defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to get recognized," said Modry, tied for third among
NHL defensemen with 24 assists. "You believe in something and it pays
off for you, it's great."</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Andy Murray: "I think it's a situation where he's just
gotten better with age ... I think he's been more competitive. He
would say it's because he's getting more ice time, and I would say
he's getting more ice time because he's more competitive. He's just
playing harder. He's playing good hockey."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are expected to allow Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky to
play for Slovakia in an Olympic preliminary-round game against Latvia
on Feb. 10 at Salt Lake City. They will not miss any King games....
With Eric Belanger listed as day to day after suffering a wrist
injury Tuesday night, the Kings recalled forward Brad Chartrand from
their American Hockey League team at Manchester, N.H.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Sabres (2000-01)--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Tuesday's victory moved the Kings into a playoff slot but
Murray saw no reason to celebrate. "I'm no more excited today to be
in eighth place," he said Wednesday, "than I was yesterday to be in
ninth place because I know that things can change so much in the
remaining 36 games."</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal, The Big Pachyderm, went another day without
discussing the whiffed punch that cost him three games, about
$729,000 and his duty to cover Miami's Alonzo Mourning on Wednesday
and San Antonio's David Robinson on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But he is amusing himself and the media with his occasional bits
of wisdom, Tuesday on the subject of frogs kicking elephants, and
Wednesday on the importance of lawn care, particularly this time of
year.</LD>
<LD>   After the Lakers' morning shoot-around, O'Neal emerged with a
sign, handwritten. It read: "I do not waste my time in answering
abuse. I thrive under it, like a field that benefits from manure."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his 12th coaching season, Phil Jackson entered Wednesday
night's game against the Heat one victory short of Red Holzman, who
won 696 games in 18 seasons, and a tie for 13th place on the all-time
list.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's winning percentage of .741 (695-243) is the highest
ever, even with the loss to the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson appeared unaware that he was on the verge of catching
Holzman, for whom he played on the New York Knicks, though he often
credits Holzman as an early influence.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he was alive to enjoy it," Jackson said. "Most of my
demeanor and techniques are attributable to him."</TE>
<TE>   Next on the list is John MacLeod, who won 707 games in 18 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NBA suspended O'Neal for three games and forward Rick Fox said
nearly everyone loses.</TE>
<TE>   "The national audience and the NBC audience are the ones that
suffer, along with us as a team, because of Saturday's game," Fox
said. "We won't get a true assessment of what the San Antonio-Laker
matchup is about."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers beat the Spurs last Feb. 21 without Kobe Bryant, split
the four-game season series, then swept the Spurs in four games in
the Western Conference finals.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Lose in Cellars' Market</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Heat is the latest last-place team to beat
L.A., scoring 100 points for first time, 102-96.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers left the floor quietly Wednesday night, while the Miami
Heat celebrated the unfathomable behind them.</LD>
<LD>   Without Shaquille O'Neal, serving the second of his three-game
suspension, the Lakers played careless defense again and loose
offense again. They were 102-96 losers at Staples Center, and so fell
behind the Sacramento Kings in the Pacific Division. Since Dec. 21
they have been swept by the NBA's four last-place teams, though the
Memphis Grizzlies, on the strength of their win against the Lakers,
have since played themselves out of last in the Midwest Division.</LD>
<LD>   The Heat scored the last 12 points after the Lakers held a 96-90
lead. Rod Strickland scored six of the 12, the last four from the
free-throw line, and Kobe Bryant missed three difficult shots in the
final two minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant scored 29 points, but missed 18 of 30 shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat scored more than 100 points, the kind of thing that
happens for Miami every half-season or so. The Heat had not scored
100 in 35 consecutive games, all since the start of the season, an
NBA record since the advent of the shot clock. It averaged 83.7
points, worst in the league, and 11 points below the league average.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat was at its average by three possessions into the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   So in control in his 56-point, 34-attempt game Monday against
Memphis, Bryant had some rogue moments against the Heat and good
friend and former teammate Eddie Jones.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers caught the Heat at 76-76 with less than a minute left
in the third quarter, having outscored Miami, 47-23, since the middle
of the second quarter to do it.</TE>
<TE>   The third quarter concluded with the Heat holding an 80-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had their first lead at 87-86, and appeared to put the
game out of the offensively challenged Heat at 96-90. They were
scoreless thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   With the Heat holding a 46-26 lead, the crowd booed. Bryant was on
the bench, with four people between him and Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Then Eddie House made a three-pointer from the right wing, and
Laker fans booed again, louder.</TE>
<TE>   Some tried to cheer, it seemed. They pleaded for defense. Instead,
boos kept coming out.</TE>
<TE>   Given O'Neal's three-game suspension, Pat Riley ordered the
basketball to Alonzo Mourning, who was matched against Samaki Walker
and then Mark Madsen and then whoever was close enough.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 first-quarter minutes, Mourning made six of seven shots,
scored 13 points, and was forceful around the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "He has that tenacity, he wants to block everything that's going
to the basket," Jackson said. "In the beginning of the year, I don't
know if he had the strength to get there, recover and rebound on top
of it."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Mourning's liveliness was only the beginning of
the Lakers' issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat made 17 of 24 attempts in the quarter and took a 17-point
lead into the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Among the indignities for a team that considers defense its first
priority:</TE>
<TE>   The Heat's 39 first-quarter points were its most in any quarter in
13 months.</TE>
<TE>   Its 70.8 shooting percentage was its second highest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-point lead was the largest for the Heat in any quarter this
season until ... the second quarter, when it had a 24-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Lakers had three rebounds in the first quarter, in part
because the Heat did not miss very often.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Jackson sighed at the mention of the Heat's
record-- every game without reaching 100 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Pat revels in that, that he hasn't scored 100, and he has
the best defense," he said, smiling. "Hey, we found a way to lose to
all the other three division cellar-dwellers, so we certainly can
find a way to lose to them, very easily."</TE>

<LD>The mayor of Houston, one of the four U.S. cities in the running for
the 2012 Summer Olympics,  said Wednesday that all four have agreed
to what he called an "unprecedented security pact" should one of the
four win the right to stage the Games.</LD>
<LD>   Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown said he had proposed in recent days to
the mayors of New York, San Francisco and Washington that they share
"ideas and resources" on the "major security issues" at the Games,
from the design of the Olympic grounds to plans for policing the
Games.</LD>
<LD>   All agreed, Brown said.</LD>
<TE>   "One thing we don't want to see is anybody taking seriously the
notion that America would not compete [for the Games] because of
security issues," Brown said in a telephone interview. "That would be
a defeat we should not stand for."</TE>

<HD>Floridian Stewart Skyrockets to Stardom</HD>
<DH>Supercross: African American rider, 16, lives up to hype
and becomes a crowd favorite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since 1985, when the American Motorcyclist Assn. brought 125cc bikes
into supercross as a support series for the elite 250cc class, the
125s have never upstaged the main event.</LD>
<LD>   That may change Saturday night at Edison Field when a sellout
crowd roars its approval of James "Bubba" Stewart. He will be riding
in only his third professional 125cc race, yet has quickly become a
crowd favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart rides his Kawasaki KX bike with speed and daring
characteristic of supercross riders, but two things set him apart:</LD>
<TE>   * He is African American, the first rider of color to make an
impact on the young stadium sport that has evolved from motocross.</TE>
<TE>   * He is the youngest winner in supercross history. In his second
race, last weekend in San Diego, Stewart was 16 years 21 days old
when he took the checkered flag.</TE>
<TE>   Winning, however, is nothing new to the 5-foot-6, 141-pound
teenager from the central Florida town of Haines City. He joined the
pro ranks after winning everything in sight as an amateur--from the
time he was 4. He won a record 11 AMA national championships and in
his final season--as a 15-year-old 10th grader--did not lose a moto.</TE>
<TE>   Before he entered his first EA Sports Supercross as a professional
two weeks ago at Edison Field, Stewart had been on the cover of
several motocross magazines and the subject of an intense Kawasaki
and Clear Channel Entertainment promotional program.</TE>
<TE>   "After all that hype, everyone wondered how he'd respond, but he
showed us he's for real," said David Bailey, a former national
champion and now an ESPN analyst. "He's an incredible talent."</TE>
<TE>   After falling twice and still finishing second in his Anaheim
debut, Stewart smoked the field at San Diego, winning his heat and
the 15-lap main event with lap times close to those of 250cc winner
David Vuillemin, even though a 125 bike is about 15 horsepower down
from a 250.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so excited I almost wanted to cry," said the smiling
youngster in the Qualcomm Stadium winner's circle. The crowd, 68,145,
was the third largest in supercross history and most of the fans were
on their feet from the time Stewart nearly went down in mid-race
until he scaled the final jump at the finish line. He was fourth
coming out of the first turn at the start but caught and passed
leader Rodrig Thain on a high-speed right-hander on the third lap,
then built up a 10-second lead before nearly falling.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed a jump and got into the next corner too tight, so I had
to go up and over the berm and back onto the track," Stewart said. "I
almost went over the handlebars before I saved it."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart dedicated his win to Tony Haynes, a family friend and
former rider who was paralyzed in a riding accident when he was 14.
Before his injury, Haynes rode with future professionals such as Ezra
Lusk, Kevin Windham and Ricky Carmichael. Stewart rides with No. 259
on his bike, Haynes' old number.</TE>
<TE>   When Stewart took 259, he told Haynes, now 22, that he would try
to take it to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm living my dream with James," said Haynes, an aspiring hip-hop
musician in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   And how did Stewart celebrate?</TE>
<TE>   "I went back to the hotel and had a couple of cookies with my
family [father James Sr., mother Sonya and brother Malcolm, 9] and
went to bed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   James Sr., 36, a one-time motocross rider who quit to steer young
James' career, is responsible for his son becoming a racer. Around
the Kawasaki pits, he's known as Big James.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 3 or 4, I tagged along with my dad to his races and
rode around on my Suzuki ATV quad," Bubba said. "Next thing I knew, I
was racing it. But it wasn't fast enough for me. I wanted a
two-wheeler."</TE>
<TE>   Said Big James, "For his fourth birthday and Christmas, we gave
him a Yamaha 50 and went racing."</TE>
<TE>   Young Stewart immediately attracted attention by winning races all
over the Southeast, and by the time he was 7, he'd won his first
championship, in the 50cc class at the Loretta Lynn Nationals, and
was signed to a contract by Kawasaki.</TE>
<TE>   To assure his son's future four years ago, James Sr. bought 40
acres of farmland near Haines City and hired former supercross
champion Mark Barnett to build three racing tracks, one for
supercross, one for outdoor motocross and one for peewees, where
friends of the Stewarts can ride.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball stars Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin and Griffey's son,
Trey, are regulars at the Stewart tracks. Griffey, an avid supercross
fan, plans to attend nearly all of Stewart's races until spring
training starts.</TE>
<TE>   After winning his 11th national title, Stewart gave his winning
bike to Griffey, who plans to hang it in his trophy room at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Stewarts also raise cattle on the farm and as a change of pace
from his motorcycle, James sometimes rides one of the heifers.</TE>
<TE>   "I ride 'em for fun, but I'm not thinking about taking up rodeo,"
he said, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's first racing idol was Jeff Matiasevich, a lanky rider
from La Habra known as "the Chicken" when he won 125cc supercross
championships in 1988-89.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched him on TV and thought he was cool," Stewart said. "He
was so fast and he rode a Kawasaki. I talked about him so much that
my friends started calling me 'Baby Chicken.'"</TE>
<TE>   Stewart often is called "the Jackie Robinson of Supercross" and he
doesn't take that thought lightly. But he also doesn't dwell on his
pioneering.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cool to be called a pioneer, but I don't think about it
much," he said. "It doesn't put any extra pressure on me because all
I want to do is win, to do the best I can every race. I've never had
any problems [with fellow riders or fans] and I don't expect any.
Other than racing and doing autograph sessions at the track, I keep
pretty much to myself along with my dad and my trainer."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>

<LD>The Dallas Stars made the most of another chance against Western
Conference-leading Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Nieuwendyk scored two goals, the second while falling to the
ice, as host Dallas won, 3-2, Wednesday night to end the Red Wings'
six-game unbeaten streak and make up for a 5-2 loss at Detroit four
days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "We played the way we had to play to beat this team," Dallas Coach
Ken Hitchcock said. "We didn't like the feeling we had about
ourselves and we changed it. How you come out of the rough and ugly
is how you build your team."</LD>
<TE>   Nieuwendyk made a backhanded shot while falling down, and the puck
slid through the legs of Dominik Hasek 5 minutes 35 seconds into the
third period for a 3-1 Star lead. He celebrated his 18th goal while
sliding on both knees toward the boards.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings had lost only once their previous 12 games, 3-2, in
overtime at Nashville on Dec. 29. The Stars moved within a point of
Pacific Division-leading San Jose but are still seventh in the
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 2, New York Rangers 0--Tyler Wright and Grant Marshall
scored goals and Marc Denis stopped 31 shots for his first shutout in
a Blue Jacket uniform. The shutout was the fourth of Denis' career.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets won their fourth in a row at home.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 2, Washington 0--Jose Theodore stopped 28 shots and Jan
Bulis and Patrice Brisebois scored second-period goals to lead the
Canadiens at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Florida 0--Alex Zhamnov and Michael Nylander scored
4:36 apart in the third period to seal the Blackhawks' victory at
Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Jocelyn Thibault stopped 16 shots for his fifth shutout of the
season and 26th of his career.</TE>

<LD>Six-time all-star defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh and top minor league
prospect Byron Ritchie were traded by the Carolina Hurricanes to the
Florida Panthers on Wednesday for three players.</LD>
<LD>   The Hurricanes received defenseman Bret Hedican, center Kevyn
Adams and minor league prospect Tomas Malec.</LD>
<LD>   Ozolinsh, in his 10th NHL season, was picked as a starter for the
World all-star team for the second consecutive season despite
offensive numbers that didn't match his days with the Colorado
Avalanche.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in the second half of the season now, we're getting into
real critical games and we have to be more responsible defensively,"
Carolina General Manager Jim Rutherford said. In 119 career games
with Carolina, Ozolinsh had 16 goals and 51 assists for 67 points.</TE>
<TE>   Jarome Iginla was selected as a reserve for the All-Star game.
Iginla, the Calgary Flame center who leads the league with 29 goals
and 53 points, will be making his all-star debut with the North
American team. Boston's Joe Thornton, who ranked second in points
with 51, and Chicago's Eric Daze, second in goals with 26 entering
play Wednesday, will also make their all-star debuts for the North
American team.... The Dallas Stars traded left wing Valeri Kamensky
to the New Jersey Devils for defenseman Andre Lakos and future
considerations.</TE>

<LD>The Herminator won't be back.</LD>
<LD>   Austria's Hermann Maier, who won gold medals in the super-giant
slalom and giant slalom at Nagano days after he'd crashed in the
downhill, said injuries he suffered in a motorcycle accident five
months ago will prevent him from defending his titles at Salt Lake
City next month.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been my plan all along to try to make it back to the
Olympics," he told reporters Wednesday at a news conference broadcast
live on Austrian TV. "Even in my hospital bed, I was working to get
back in shape.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very close now, but not enough to take the risk. For me, it
would be better if the Olympics were next year. I'll probably go on a
holiday then and start skiing in February or March to come back next
year."</TE>
<TE>   Maier, admired for his flair and aggressiveness, broke his right
leg and suffered nerve damage in his left leg when his motorcycle was
hit by a car in Radstadt, Austria, in August. He underwent seven
hours of surgery to repair injuries caused by the impact.</TE>
<TE>   Although he skied an easy downhill Dec. 21 and said, "Never say
never," about his Olympic chances, his body wouldn't cooperate. The
nerve damage gives him the most trouble, leaving the leg numb, and he
can't put much pressure on his right leg.</TE>
<TE>   "After the doctor gave me the green light, I tried to move closer
to the limit, to ski more like in a race, but I have to say I was not
really in a position," he said. "This is why I have decided not to be
at the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame to lose a colorful personality like Maier, but the
Austrian ski team is so deep, it can absorb the loss of Maier and
Josef Strobl, who injured his knee last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Hannes Trinkl, who missed the season's first five World Cup
downhills because of a concussion, had the fastest training time
Wednesday for a World Cup downhill on the Streif course in
Kitzbuehel, Austria. He was clocked in 1 minute 55.89 seconds and was
one of four Austrians in the top seven, even though World Cup
downhill and overall leader Stephan Eberharter skipped the practice,
as did teammates Fritz Strobl and Andreas Schifferer.</TE>
<TE>   Daron Rahlves of Sugar Bowl, Calif., who was last season's super-G
world champion but has struggled this season, had the fourth-fastest
training time Wednesday, 1:56.09. Rahlves had good results in
Kitzbuehel last year, finishing third in a World Cup downhill and
fourth in a super-G.</TE>
<TE>   Angel or Devil?</TE>
<TE>   Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who finished second at the U.S.
Figure Skating Championships last week and won an Olympic berth, is a
sweet-faced 17-year-old with a ferocious competitive streak.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no reason to believe she was trying to hurt Michelle
Kwan--or anyone else--during the warmup for the women's free skate
Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen might have breached skating etiquette by getting close to
her competitors, but some fanatics have vilified her as a brat who
should be thrown off the Olympic team. That's an overreaction. Kwan
and Sarah Hughes nearly collided too. No skater or coach complained
to the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. about Cohen, a USFSA spokesman said,
and no one from the USFSA thought anything untoward happened,
although the other top finishers were chilly toward Cohen afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen would have gained nothing by injuring anyone because she
could have been hurt too, and taken herself out of contention. She
and Kwan brushed arms once and had one other close encounter. It
wasn't Oksana Baiul and Tanja Szewczenko colliding at the 1994 World
Championships, which left Baiul with a cut on her leg and Szewczenko
with a sore shoulder and hip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always trying to get my jumps in," Cohen said. "There are six
ladies and I try to go for my stuff and go around people. Sometimes
it's hard."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kwan, "There are six skaters on the ice and everyone is in
their own zone."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan gathered herself perfectly well. So did Hughes. As
world-class athletes, they can take care of themselves and ignore
distractions. This is "the Show," and there's a lot at stake. Cohen
is competitive. If competitiveness is prized among male athletes, why
should it be criticized when it's demonstrated by female athletes?</TE>
<TE>   "There's no place for shrinking violets in competitive ladies'
skating," said Cohen's coach, John Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   "They may look almost fragile but they're tough kids."</TE>
<TE>   Amen.</TE>
<TE>   Legal Roundup</TE>
<TE>   Bobsled brakeman Jen Davidson, bumped off Jean Racine's sled and
the U.S. Olympic team in favor of Gea Johnson, filed a grievance with
the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, asking for a new push-off
and a chance to regain her spot.</TE>
<TE>   Davidson's grievance invoked Article 9 of the U.S. Olympic
Committee's constitution and bylaws and said she was denied an
opportunity to compete because "the application of the criteria to
select the brakemen was unfair." She claims Racine promised her the
brakeman spot at the Olympic trials, so she felt it was unnecessary
to take part in a push-off with other brakemen before a World Cup
competition that preceded the trials.</TE>
<TE>   Racine, who had reaped more than $500,000 in endorsements with
Davidson, dropped Davidson because her push times were slower than
other brakemen's times.</TE>
<TE>   Racine and Johnson were the fastest duo at the trials last month
at Park City, Utah. They won Olympic spots, as did Jill Bakken and
Vonetta Flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Roy, executive director of the USBSF, said his organization
was asked by the USOC to file a response and did so earlier this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, our response is, we feel we ran our trials according
to a selection process that was approved by the USOC, and to do
anything else would certainly not be right," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jen had the right to push off and chose not to.... We believe the
best athletes were selected to our team, and the results in the last
World Cup, plus the training that has gone on since then, back that."</TE>
<TE>   A decision must be made by Jan. 28, the deadline for Olympic
qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on the sports docket, arbitrator James Holbrook will
hold a preliminary hearing Friday to decide if he has jurisdiction to
rule on a grievance filed by short-track speedskater Tommy O'Hare,
who alleged Apolo Anton Ohno and Rusty Smith conspired to fix a race
at the Olympic trials and keep O'Hare off the team.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Speedskating contends that any evidence of one skater
blocking another or conspiring with another should have been handled
by the referees the day of the race, and the referees took no action.
If the arbitrator decides he has jurisdiction, a hearing will be held
next week in Colorado Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, of Sunset Beach, said the incident had been blown out of
proportion.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely nothing happened," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen of 20 members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team have
agreed to participate in a Feb. 1 reunion game against NHL alumni, to
be held during the All-Star festivities in Los Angeles. The lone
holdout is Mark Pavelich, who has not appeared with his teammates
since their post-victory visit to the White House. A 19-player
turnout would be the largest gathering since that White House visit
shortly after the Lake Placid Games.... Two former Kings will be
coaches in the Jan. 30 celebrity game. Butch Goring will coach
producer Jerry Bruckheimer's Bad Boys, and Rogie Vachon will coach
David E. Kelley's Heroes.</TE>
<TE>   USOC President Sandra Baldwin said she expects U.S. athletes to
win 20 medals at the Salt Lake City Games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real stretch when we started," she said. "But my
personal count may even be a little higher than that. I have every
confidence, if a couple of athletes don't get hurt, that we'll be
right there."</TE>
<TE>   The most ever won by the U.S. at the Winter Games was 13 at
Lillehammer in 1994 and again at Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin cited figure skating, snowboarding, freestyle skiing,
speedskating and bobsledding as the top U.S. hopes for medals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've invested a lot of time and money in having our winter
sports do well, and we'll have a great legacy with the facilities
afterward," she said. "Now we just have to watch it pay off."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Sports Council and the city of Long Beach have bid
to host the 2004 U.S. Olympic water polo trials. Long Beach has
already secured the 2004 Olympic swim trials. A decision is expected
next week from USA Water Polo, the sport's national governing body.</TE>

<HD>Owners Ratify Sale of Red Sox</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Henry group to take over franchise for $660
million, the first move in major reconstruction of sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Major league baseball owners voted Wednesday to approve the sale of
the Boston Red Sox, the first step toward a historic reconstruction
of a sport that prides itself on franchise stability.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox sold for a record $660 million to a group led by
Florida Marlin owner John Henry. Within two weeks, Henry is expected
to sell the Marlins to Jeffrey Loria, owner of the Montreal Expos,
for $158 million, with baseball buying out Loria for $120 million.</LD>
<LD>   With or without a farewell season in Montreal, the Expos would
then be moved, most likely to Washington D.C., or folded. No major
league team has moved since the Senators left Washington and became
the Texas Rangers in 1971; no team has folded since 1899.</LD>
<TE>   In a winter in which owners voted to eliminate two teams, Henry,
at least temporarily, owns parts of three teams--the Red Sox, Marlins
and New York Yankees, in which he owns a 1% stake. While Henry joked
that Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf had offered a limited
share in that franchise as well, Commissioner Bud Selig said that
Henry would be required to sell the Marlins, and his interest in the
Yankees, by the time the Red Sox sale closes.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said he expects the sale to close next month, which would
allow Henry and his partners to assume control of the Red Sox during
spring training. The sale price is more than double the previous
record of $323 million, paid by Charles Dolan two years ago for the
Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Dolan's brother Larry, a cable television magnate, and New York
attorney Miles Prentice, outbid the Henry group for the Red Sox, with
Dolan offering $750 million and Prentice $755 million. That caught
the attention of Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Thomas Reilly, who
investigated whether the charities benefiting from the sale would be
shortchanged by acceptance of the lesser bid.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Reilly asked Selig to delay a vote on the Red Sox
sale, then withdrew the request after Henry and the outgoing Boston
owners agreed to contribute another $30 million to the charitable
trust.</TE>
<TE>   Henry and his partners, including former San Diego Padre owner Tom
Werner, were giddy about their imminent takeover of one of baseball's
treasured franchises. Werner read congratulatory statements from
legendary Red Sox stars Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski, then said,
"We're looking forward to opening day and setting about the goal of
erasing the Curse of the Bambino."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Expos nor the Marlins can yet look forward to opening
day, with both franchises paralyzed by the ownership shuffle and the
apparently unsuccessful plan to eliminate two teams this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins have yet to submit a sale application to Selig's
office, Henry's attorney said. David Samson, the Expos' executive
vice president, said the list of sale issues to be resolved has been
whittled from 357 to eight.</TE>
<TE>   When the Marlins' sale is approved, Loria and Samson are expected
to take several Expo staff members with them to Florida, including
Manager Jeff Torborg and General Manager Larry Beinfest. Selig's
office would run the Expos until they could be sold, moved or folded.</TE>
<TE>   Selig said Wednesday that the plan to eliminate teams this winter
remains "a viable option" but added, "I understand time is running
[out] on us."</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins, the other team targeted for elimination along
with the Expos, has found a potential savior in Alabama businessman
Donald Watkins, who has promised to buy the team and build a stadium
with private funds.</TE>
<TE>   In Montreal, Samson said no local investors have expressed
interest in buying the Expos--"not one, not ever." Selig said he did
not anticipate any team moving this winter, so owners would likely
operate the Expos as a lame-duck franchise in Montreal this year. The
Expos could then be eliminated, if owners revive those plans next
season, or sold and moved.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos ranked last in the major leagues in attendance last
season, with an average of 7,648 fans per game, and last in revenue
at $34 million, less than one-third the industry average. Owners paid
another $29 million to the Expos in revenue sharing, a commitment
they do not wish to sustain in a market in which they see no hope for
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenues in Montreal cannot support a baseball team," Samson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Henry, who grew up in Apple Valley and founded his
commodities trading firm in Newport Beach, is taking over a storied
franchise in Boston, one with perhaps the most passionate and devoted
fans in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox made just about as much money last season on ticket
sales alone as the Angels made from ticket sales, concessions,
parking, radio and television contracts and every other source of
operating revenue combined.</TE>
<TE>   Before Henry joined the ownership group that won the bidding for
the Red Sox, he negotiated to buy the Angels from the Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels reported operating losses of $100 million from
1995-2001, but Henry believes a winning team in Anaheim could be a
profitable one with reform of the major league economic system.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tremendous market," Henry said. "I think the
problems they have had have been related to the problems baseball has
in general. You see how much money the Dodgers are losing. I really
don't think it's fair to blame Disney for problems that have been
happening for so many years."</TE>
<TE>   Selig delivered Henry to Disney as a potential buyer, convinced
that he could solve two problems at once--getting Henry out of
Florida, where he had been unable to secure a new stadium, and
getting Disney the buyer it has been unable to find for more than two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Henry met with Disney executives in Burbank to win their approval
and negotiated with former Angel president Tony Tavares and Angel
vice president Rick Schlesinger for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Henry called off negotiations in November, he said, before he knew
he could join the Red Sox bidding group. Disney told major league
officials it would accept $250 million for the Angels as part of
Selig's plan; Henry said he walked away over several issues, "not
strictly price."</TE>
<TE>   Said Henry: "I felt like we were close. But there wasn't enough
give from both parties. That happens in a deal sometimes."</TE>

<HD>Brady Hunch Pays for Patriots</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Season seemed to be in the drink, but Bledsoe
injury and quarterback change turned it around.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dearly beloved:</LD>
<LD>   We are gathered here to pay our final respects to the old New
England Patriots. You know the team, the one that staggered to a 1-3
start; was nearly torn asunder by Drew Bledsoe's aching chest (and
Terry Glenn's bellyaching); and, a month into the season, was
thoroughly embarrassed in a 30-10 loss at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   That defeat prompted Patriot Coach Bill Belichick to grumble, "We
just got our butts kicked," and no one disagreed.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Belichick sank a shovel into a spot just off the
practice field. He dug a small grave and laid the game ball to rest,
stepping aside as players tamped down the dirt with their cleats.</TE>
<TE>   Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.</TE>
<TE>   Chaos to playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots will play host to the Oakland Raiders on Saturday in
an AFC divisional playoff game. Unlike the Raiders, who roared out of
the gate and seemed to peak at midseason, the Patriots overcame a
slow start and the loss of Pro Bowl quarterback Bledsoe to win eight
of their last nine.</TE>
<TE>   New England's amazing turnaround from punching bag to AFC East
champion--orchestrated in part by backup quarterback Tom Brady and
scrap-heap running back Antowain Smith--rivals that of the 1999 St.
Louis Rams, who lost quarterback Trent Green, then rode arena-league
refugee Kurt Warner all the way to a Super Bowl victory.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick has done fix-it jobs before. He took over the 3-13
Cleveland Browns in 1991 and, over the next four seasons, built them
into an 11-5 playoff contender. But that was nothing like this.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the season started, the Patriots were rife with
problems. They were unable to sign Pittsburgh running back Chris
Fuamatu-Ma'afala, so they settled for Smith, a castoff from Buffalo.
Their offensive line was riddled with injuries; each starting lineman
missed at least one exhibition game. And Glenn, their oft-troubled
star receiver, was warring with the front office, which was holding
back deferred payments on his $11.5-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the season started and things really took a turn for the
worse. In the second game, against the New York Jets, Bledsoe was
clobbered by linebacker Mo Lewis and suffered a sheared blood vessel
in his lung. He lost half the blood in his body over a 21/2-hour
span. The potentially fatal injury sidelined him for eight weeks--and
probably cost him his job for good. This is the guy the Patriots had
drafted first overall in 1993, had led them to the Super Bowl three
years later, had accepted a $103-million contract before last season,
and whose face is still plastered above the team's Web site. Bledsoe
was the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   He also had been outplayed in training camp by Brady, a
sixth-round pick from Michigan in 2000. Brady, who faced plenty of
starting defenses in exhibition games, finished with a 91.9
quarterback rating, completing 57% of his passes for two touchdowns
with no interceptions. He was never sacked, either, even though he
stood tall in the pocket and didn't shrink from contact. Bledsoe had
a 70.7 rating with a touchdown and an interception, and was sacked
seven times.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, when it became apparent that Bledsoe would be out
indefinitely because of his chest injury, and Brady would be taking
the helm, any air left in New England's season hissed out. Or so it
seemed.</TE>
<TE>   But people who watched the situation closely knew that Brady was
among the team's hardest workers, a tireless perfectionist who'd
added 15 pounds of muscle in the off-season and had uncommon zip on
his passes.</TE>
<TE>   He played well in relief of Bledsoe in the Jet game, beat
Indianapolis the next week, then took a big step backward in a shaky
performance against Miami. That's when Belichick buried the game
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, though, Brady was spending just about every
waking moment on improving. He and Bledsoe worked well together, as
did backup quarterback Damon Huard. The three would devise weekly
quizzes, trying to trip up one another on the nuances of the
playbook.</TE>
<TE>   Some childhood friends of Brady had planned to visit him in Boston
but were willing to reschedule when he became the starter. Nonsense,
he told them. They stayed at his house, although he didn't have much
time for R&amp;R.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in Tommyland, that's what we call it," friend Steve Loerke
said. "We'd be watching a golf tournament or playing pool downstairs.
He was on the couch going over the game plan. We were in amazement.
'How do you comprehend this language?' He just gets in a zone, very
focused. You can tell when he's playing a game the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Week by week, Brady improved. He isn't terribly mobile, but he's
tough and could handle the beating that most starting quarterbacks
endure. In the background was Bledsoe, who was supportive of his
understudy but still territorial and competitive about getting his
job back.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I'll be the starter as long as I'm here," Bledsoe said in
mid-October. "At the same time, I know it's not given to anybody."</TE>
<TE>   A month later, a recovered Bledsoe was visibly upset over
Belichick's decision to stick with Brady as the starter for the rest
of the season. Bledsoe said he wasn't even given a chance to win the
job back in practice. Folks began to speculate what Bledsoe might
bring in a trade, and Brady continued on with a dream season that
would ultimately land him an invitation to the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He completed 63.9% of his passes and threw 18 touchdowns to only
12 interceptions. He is the fifth quarterback in league history to
make the Pro Bowl in his first year as a starter, following in the
footsteps of Brett Favre, Daunte Culpepper, Dan Marino and Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Belichick didn't expect anything less.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been consistent," Belichick said. "You don't see a guy that
goes out there one day and throws five or six interceptions and then
the next day hits four or five miracle passes. You see pretty much
the same thing every day. His reads, his throwing accuracy, his
consistency, I'm not saying it's unbelievable, but it's good and it
gives you confidence when you call a play."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, this isn't a one-man show. Brady has been reliable, often
better than that. But, most important, he didn't do things to lose
games.</TE>
<TE>   The team's most dangerous offensive threat is Troy Brown, an
ultra-reliable possession receiver and punt returner. He caught 101
passes this season, breaking the team record of 96 set by tight end
Ben Coates in 1994. Whereas Glenn is faster and makes breathtaking
plays, Brown has a rock-solid character and work ethic. He likes to
be the last player out of the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Smith is a good guy too. He was raised by his grandparents in
Millbrook, Ala., where he first took up football as a senior in high
school, and instantly emerged as a standout running back. He received
offers from several colleges but turned them down so he could work at
a nearby factory and support his grandparents for the next two years.
After the death of his grandmother, he enrolled in junior college for
a year, then spent the next two playing at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   He was Buffalo's first-round pick in 1997, and led the Bills in
rushing the next two seasons. He was second in rushing in '99, then
his playing time dropped off sharply last season. The Bills released
him in May, and he signed with New England a month later.</TE>
<TE>   Smith could be a huge factor Saturday, especially if nasty weather
makes it difficult to throw the ball. A big game by him would keep
the party going in New England. And the Patriots would like nothing
better. Because, hey, these are the playoffs, not a funeral.</TE>

<LD>One of Fernando Vargas' managers stared into the sweating, howling
crowd and sneered, "I invite you to watch Oscar De La Hoya enter the
caves of hell and dance with the devil!"</LD>
<LD>   In the past, this town's gold-plated boxer would have shrugged off
such muttering as hype.</LD>
<LD>   But on a curious Wednesday, De La Hoya embraced it as
understatement.</LD>
<TE>   In the bowels of the stately Biltmore, in the first round of the
De La Hoya-Vargas promotion, mayhem assaulted reason, impulse
overruled intelligence, and De La Hoya knocked out a game plan.</TE>
<TE>   For the next four months, the seemingly dignified fighter will
crawl through those caves, dancing that dance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bad blood," he said. "This is for reals."</TE>
<TE>   This is also the apparent cost of resurrecting a boxing career, De
La Hoya's larger goal when he fights Vargas May 4 in Las Vegas in the
juiciest all-L.A. boxing match in years.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to regain his position atop the boxing world, despite
nearly a year's inactivity, De La Hoya has chosen to begin his climb
from those unfamiliar surroundings known as the mud.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in memory, De La Hoya acknowledged he dislikes
an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate Vargas," he said. "I really hate him."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he attacked an opponent's machismo.</TE>
<TE>   "Vargas is obsessed with me, he's in love with me, he's like a
celebrity stalker," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he talked about ponderings that did not
involve music or riches.</TE>
<TE>   "I really have been having sweet dreams about seeing Vargas on the
canvas, just laying there, his little hairs sticking up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After this strange interview, De La Hoya was then dragged into the
alley by his words, Vargas shoving him in the chest when the boxers
met for the traditional opening chin-to-chin photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Another Oscar first.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he's crying, he's crying!" shouted Vargas later.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that the best you can do?" shouted De La Hoya. "Look, he
didn't even tear my tie!"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprisingly, this was not the first time Vargas has
popped somebody like that. But this was the first time he has done so
while wearing an electronic anklet monitored by Santa Barbara law
enforcement officials while he serves a 90-day home sentence for
assault.</TE>
<TE>   If Santa Barbara wants to let its bad guys roam the streets,
that's Santa Barbara's business. But shouldn't that monitoring thing
have been put around, I don't know, his fists?</TE>
<TE>   "If he swings at me," De La Hoya had said, "all I have to do is
call his probation officer."</TE>
<TE>   By now, that probably won't be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But be prepared for that sort of promotion, that sort of fight.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after their altercation Wednesday, fans in one side of the
room began chanting, in Spanish, that De La Hoya was a sissy.</TE>
<TE>   Then Vargas imitated De La Hoya in feminine intonations.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya countered with his own chant about Vargas' apparent
glass jaw.</TE>
<TE>   "I know where to hit him," he said in a sing-song voice. " I know
where to hit him."</TE>
<TE>   It's all very silly. It's not very Golden.</TE>
<TE>   But it's all quite serious.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya, having suffered his only two losses in his last five
fights, desperately needs to flick aside the pesky Vargas before
rebuilding a boxing career that recently has sat virtually dormant.</TE>
<TE>   How can he regain the respect of the boxing world if he first
can't conquer his own neighborhood?</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, meanwhile, needs De La Hoya in precisely the same manner.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to become a popular champion again, one year after his
only loss.</TE>
<TE>   But every road there leads through De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   Many wonder if De La Hoya has lost his fire. The same people
wonder if Vargas, since being pounded a year ago by Felix Trinidad,
has lost his head.</TE>
<TE>   Each boxer is like a flailing swimmer. Each boxer considers his
opponent a handy life preserver.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate men, four desperate months.</TE>
<TE>   Even the hyperbolic promoters are closing in on the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a fight for the streets," said Gary Shaw, Vargas'
promoter. "This is for the championship of the streets."</TE>
<TE>   In a rivalry that began with words from the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Since enduring a perceived snub as an amateur, Vargas has spent
much of his career claiming that De La Hoya was a chicken.</TE>
<TE>   He claims De La Hoya ran from Trinidad, ran from Sugar Shane
Mosley, and will run again.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya wants terribly, finally, to disagree with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to become the great person that I lost," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas also claims De La Hoya is not a real Mexican American,
whatever that means.</TE>
<TE>   He claims De La Hoya has grown too rich and snobbish for his East
L.A. roots, whereas Vargas maintains close ties to his friends in
Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya wants to become the sort of resilient boxer who can win
back those fans.</TE>
<TE>   Said De La Hoya, "It's not gonna be close."</TE>
<TE>   Said Vargas, "We're gonna get down."</TE>
<TE>   They're already there.</TE>

<LD>Dana Hills Fires Orloff as Football Coach</LD>
<LD>   Scott Orloff has been fired as the football coach at Dana Hills
High. Orloff's team finished 2-8 last season, 0-5 in the South Coast
League. He compiled a 22-39-1 record in six seasons but took the
program to the playoffs in his second year, its first appearance in
six seasons.</LD>
<LD>   "I talked to the principal [Carolyn Williams] at the end of
November about our direction and we were set in place," Orloff said.
"We were rolling, working hard in the weight room. I was called into
the office on Friday and all that was said to me was that we were
going in a different direction and [I was] asked to resign. There was
no other reason given. I said I wasn't going to do it. I wasn't going
to quit on my kids, my coaches or my community."</LD>
<TE>   Williams, the fourth principal in Orloff's six years at Dana
Hills, agreed she wanted the program to move in a different
direction. She said wins and losses weren't a primary factor in her
decision but declined to address specifics.</TE>

<HD>Tailor Fit Wears World Champion Crown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polling 62 of the 87 votes, Tailor Fit has been named world champion
quarter horse for 2001, becoming the eighth multiple winner of the
award and only the third horse to win the title in non-consecutive
years.</LD>
<LD>   Tailor Fit was voted world champion in 1999, then won only two of
five starts in 2000 as the undefeated A Ransom won the title. A
Ransom finished second in the 2001 polling with 21 votes. Four
horses--Hawkinson, Pivotal Decision, Stoli and Tres Seis--received
one vote apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Before Tailor Fit, the only horses to repeat as world champion in
non-consecutive years were Maddon's Bright Eyes in 1949 and 1951 and
Kaweah Bar in 1968 and 1970. The last horse to be voted world
champion twice was SLM Big Daddy in 1997-98.</LD>
<TE>   Tailor Fit was trained by Steve VanBebber when he won the world
championship in 1999. Charged by Texas racing authorities with
running two illegally drugged horses, VanBebber feared a lengthy,
career-ending suspension and committed suicide in December 2000.
Janet VanBebber, his wife, took over the stable and trained Tailor
Fit last year as the 6-year-old California-bred gelding won four of
six starts, climaxed by a victory in the Champion of Champions race
at Los Alamitos. A Ransom, winner of the Champion of Champions in
2000, was third this time, beaten by more than a half-length.</TE>
<TE>   "The word that best illustrates Tailor Fit is class," Janet
VanBebber said. "I'm proud as a horseman of what this horse has
accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Alvin "Bubba" Brossette, replacing Jacky Martin, rode Tailor Fit
in his last three races last year. Picked out by Janet VanBebber at a
yearling auction, Tailor Fit was bought by Tom Ward for $24,000 and
sold two years later for $130,000 to Betty Jane Burlin, owner of a
real estate firm in College Station, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   In voting for champion trainer, Janet VanBebber was edged by John
Bassett, who had 41 wins, including victories by Ausual Suspect in
the All American Futurity and Achievement in the Los Alamitos Million
Juvenile. Bassett will begin the year serving a 45-day suspension
after he recently dropped an appeal stemming from one of his horses
testing positive for cocaine at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico last
June. Bassett said this week that he was innocent, suggesting that
one of the horse's handlers, who also tested positive for cocaine,
probably accidentally contaminated the horse.</TE>
<TE>   Tailor Fit also was voted best aged champion and champion aged
gelding. Other winners were: Your First Moon, 2-year-old filly; Tres
Seis, 2-year-old colt; Shining Sky, 2-year-old gelding; Tiny First
Effort, 3-year-old filly; Stoli, 3-year-old colt; Whosleavingwho,
3-year-old gelding; Hawkinson, aged stallion; Corona Cool, aged mare;
Sign Of Lanty, distance champion; Sizzling Lil, champion broodmare;
and Royal Quick Wind, Canadian champion. Hawkinson, named on 88 of
the ballots for aged stallion, was the top vote-getter.</TE>
<TE>   In separate voting, Your First Moon beat out Tres Seis as best
overall 2-year-old by four votes, and Stoli was voted best
3-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Allred, owner of Los Alamitos Race Course, was voted champion
breeder for a record eighth time. Joe Badilla Jr. was voted top
jockey for a fourth time. The owner award went to Dutch Masters III,
a partnership consisting of James Streelman of Anaheim and Denny Boer
and Doug Benson of Jerome, Idaho. Dutch Masters won 58 races with
horses that earned $969,565.</TE>

<LD>Most coaches would look at a tape of three freshmen frozen with stage
fright against a cross-town rival and vow to keep them on the bench
forevermore.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Lavin vowed to increase their playing time. Against the
nation's No. 1 team.</LD>
<LD>   Cedric Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson were scoreless
in a loss to USC a week ago. So Lavin increased their combined
minutes from 17 to 50 against Kansas on Saturday, and UCLA won.</LD>
<TE>   "After the USC game, I turned the tape off at 2 a.m. and was sick
to my stomach," he said. "I realized I probably cost us a win because
I didn't use the bench enough."</TE>
<TE>   Depth is a Bruin strength, and Lavin must remind himself not to
leave veterans Jason Kapono, Matt Barnes and Billy Knight on the
court too long.</TE>
<TE>   "The depth allowed us to beat Kansas," he said. "With the
freshmen, I have to let them fall and pick themselves back up. They
have to come of age, even if it costs us a couple wins. We will be
better for that come tournament time."</TE>

wise for the Bruins because the Sun Devils present a difficult
matchup. Curtis Millage (averaging 13.5 points), Kenny Crandall and
Kyle Dodd are quick guards, the kind that bother UCLA. Unless Rico
Hines unexpectedly recovers from a concussion before the game,
freshman Cedric Bozeman will make his first start since Nov. 28.
Arizona State is hot, having won five of its last six. UCLA has won

<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Being a disciplinarian and keeping his team grounded are part of the
job. So USC Coach Henry Bibby had no problem chasing the No. 18
Trojans out of the gym earlier this week and onto the track for some
extra running. This after some Trojans skipped a weightlifting
session.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby didn't want the first-place Trojans to get comfortable after
last week's victory over UCLA extended their winning streak to nine
games.</LD>
<LD>   "It was punishment to say, 'Hey, now is not the time to start
taking time off and start feeling good about yourselves because 5-0
[in Pacific 10 Conference play] is nothing at this point in time,'"
Bibby said of the impromptu track meet. "'So keep plugging away and
keep doing the things you need to do, stay solid.'"</LD>
<TE>   Bibby will see tonight if the Trojans heeded his words, as USC
plays  No. 15 Arizona at Tucson, where USC has not won since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   To a man, the Trojans insist they have not developed over-inflated
senses of themselves. It's quite the opposite, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have things to prove," freshman guard Errick Craven
said. "There's still no respect. After beating UCLA, people are
looking at it as a fluke."</TE>

<HD>Venus Runs Into Trouble</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Though she advances to the third round, a
recurrence of knee tendinitis produces some doubts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>Venus Williams' pursuit of her first Australian Open singles title
hit its first serious challenge Wednesday, and it didn't have
anything to do with the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Tendinitis flared in her left knee and nearly knocked her out in
the second round. Had Williams been playing someone who represented a
genuine threat--no disrespect to her opponent, 79th-ranked Kristina
Brandi--she probably would have been eliminated.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the second-seeded Williams survived pain and limited
mobility, beating Brandi, 6-3, 6-4, in 58 minutes, though the victory
did not eliminate doubt over her continued participation. Discomfort
showed in Williams' service motion and, at times, she did not sit
down on changeovers.</LD>
<TE>   Another Williams' withdrawal because of injury would prove
devastating to the injury-ravaged tournament. Venus' younger sister,
Serena, pulled out on the first day because of an injured right
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Venus showed up at Melbourne Park shortly before noon , did
not practice but was said to be doing all right. More important, the
injury did not appear to have worsened.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been there and done that, and I think that I'm pretty
experienced at dealing with injuries, so I'll just hope for the best
and get some [treatment] time," Williams said. "And you know, I just
feel like Serena wasn't able to play so I just have to give it my all
maybe, and just hang around a little longer."</TE>
<TE>   It sounded as though Venus, 21, was taking matters into her own
hands, fully aware of previous criticism over late injury
withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   This episode of tendinitis occurred about 20 minutes before the
match, she said, and she was unable to receive much treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," she said. "If my dad were here he probably would
have talked me out of it. But he wasn't. And I didn't say anything to
my mom before I went, so it was a sneaking little thing."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is scheduled to play 18-year-old Daniela Hantuchova of
Slovakia, ranked 28th, in the next round. Though she was able to beat
Brandi with one healthy knee, Williams was realistic about her
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was playing maybe a top player, I think my chances would
have been very slim," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And, in a vast understatement, Williams summed up the first four
days at the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to be just a really bad tournament for the seeds," she
said.</TE>

<HD>School Testing Gains Slowing, Analysis Shows</HD>
<DH>Education: Nearly 60% of O.C. campuses saw smaller gains last year,
almost mirroring statewide trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Improvement in statewide achievement scores has slowed as schools
find progress harder to maintain in the third year of California's school
accountability program, an analysis of state data showed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the general movement remained upward statewide, two-thirds of
all schools in California saw their scores decline or made smaller
testing gains last year than in the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The pace of improvement also slowed significantly in Orange County,
where almost 60% of more than 500 campuses fell short of their gains the
year before.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Orange County schools remained ahead of the pack in the
accountability index. Overall, 335 local schools, or 64%, are performing
better than the statewide average, according to rankings released
Wednesday. The number of such schools in 2000 was 317.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers and education leaders said it is natural for the pace of
improvement in testing to ease. But they stressed that elementary schools
serving disadvantaged students have gained the most from
multibillion-dollar educational reforms--even if they find each next step
up harder.</TE>
<TE>   "In general our schools are doing OK. They understand they haven't
lost ground," said Mardell Kolls, director of research and evaluation for
the Santa Ana Unified School District, where many students come from poor
families and nearly two-thirds are still learning English.</TE>
<TE>   The district, like the rest of the county and the state, saw many of
its schools unable to maintain the pace of two years ago. However, there
were some notable exceptions. Carl Harvey Elementary topped its 68-point
increase from two years ago with an additional 85 points last year for a
total score of 615.</TE>
<TE>   The school, where more than 90% of students are disadvantaged, has
received private grants and its teachers are using new techniques to
teach students who are not fluent in English, Kolls said. "We are using
the school as a case study," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the steady growth, the majority of Santa Ana schools still
rank in the bottom half of the state. The state ranks schools by placing
them into one of 10 levels by their API scores, with 1 as the lowest and
10 the highest.</TE>
<TE>   Those rankings were released Wednesday, and an analysis by The Times
showed continuing disparities between urban and more suburban campuses. A
majority of schools in Los Angeles County, for example, placed in the
bottom half of the 10 divisions. More than half of the schools in the Los
Angeles Unified School District were in the bottom three groupings. The
situation is the reverse in more suburban Orange and Ventura counties,
where the majority of schools are in the seventh level and higher.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings are the cornerstone of Gov. Gray Davis' school
accountability system, which is intended to measure academic improvement.
Each of more than 7,000 schools receives a score ranging from 200 to
1,000.</TE>
<TE>   The scores so far have been based on results from the Stanford 9 exam,
but the rankings released Wednesday include results from the English
Language Arts exams, which reflect California's new standards for this
subject. That addition may have hurt some schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It had very much of an impact," said Marisela Longacre, principal at
Jackson Elementary School in Santa Ana, where nearly 80% of students are
not fluent in English.</TE>
<TE>   Despite steady increases in its API scores, the school dropped to the
lowest percentile rank once the special English exam was added in.</TE>
<TE>   "We really worked hard, and we were very disappointed," Longacre said.
"We scored higher than we ever did in the API."</TE>
<TE>   The rankings have no effect on the school's eligibility for awards,
but "was a blow to our morale," she said. "But we are done feeling sorry
for ourselves. It is time to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Schools are assigned annual "growth targets," and those that reach or
exceed them are eligible for financial rewards that can include bonuses
of up to $25,000 for individual teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The California system also is designed to give schools in the bottom
rungs an added boost by rewarding them with extra accountability points
for test-score improvements. But low-performing schools that consistently
fail to improve can see their administrators reassigned and face state
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Davis on Wednesday touted the rising accountability scores in the
Academic Performance Index as proof that his reforms are working.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite remarkable that tests are up three years in a row," Davis
told a news conference at John Bidwell Elementary School in Sacramento.
"We believe we've exceeded expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Leading educators echoed Davis' assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The gains are continuing and that's a good thing," said David Rogosa,
a statistician at Stanford University who has analyzed the state's
accountability data. "The schools that need to make improvement are
making improvement. It's a very positive story."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rogosa and other researchers speculated about the causes of the
slower pace of improvement in the most recent round of scores. School
accountability programs typically produce early inflated gains as schools
concentrate on the tests and students and teachers first learn to master
the mechanics and pacing.</TE>
<TE>   "As you get higher, it obviously gets harder to grow," said Austin
Buffum, deputy superintendent of education at Capistrano Unified School
District, whose schools rank among the highest in the state. "You can get
a big jump initially if you do a lot of test preparation, but that may be
a little deceiving. We took a more measured approach. We did some test
preparation, but we really pushed standards teaching. What you want is
constant and steady growth."</TE>
<TE>   The latest scores show that 40% of Capistrano schools improved their
scores by even larger margins than they had the year before.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Education's accountability data for individual
schools can be viewed at http://www.cde.ca.gov.</TE>

<HD>OCTA to Fix Freeway but Pay a Toll First</HD>
<DH>Transit: Express Lanes owners to get $4 million to compensate for
revenue lost when the 91 is widened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Wednesday agreed to
pay $4 million in public funds to a private tollway company in order to
remove a key bottleneck on the heavily traveled Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest attempt to relieve congestion on the 91, OCTA board
members unanimously approved a multimillion-dollar widening for a short
stretch of the highway's westbound lanes just east of Coal Canyon Road.</LD>
<LD>   To get the project off the ground, OCTA will pay $4 million to the
owners of the 91 Express Lanes, a privately owned tollway that runs down
the middle of the freeway. The lane owners have veto power over
improvements to the public portions of the highway.</LD>
<TE>   Under a franchise agreement with the state, owners of the 10-mile
turnpike from north Anaheim to the Riverside County line can block
freeway widenings or new road construction if those improvements threaten
to take away toll lane customers.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County is now suing to end that agreement, and some critics
of the Express Lanes say the restrictions have been a stumbling block to
improvements along one of the most congested highways in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We are no longer willing to sit on the sidelines while traffic
continues to get worse," said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
chairs the OCTA board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make 250,000 to 270,000 trips a day on the Riverside Freeway
through Santa Ana Canyon--most of them commuters headed from Riverside
and San Bernardino counties to jobs in Orange and Los Angeles counties.
If trends continue, more than 400,000 car trips a day will be made
through the corridor by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA and tollway officials described the $4-million payment as a fair
compromise that will compensate the Express Lanes for a potential loss of
business while allowing a much-needed improvement to the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30,000 trips a day are made on the Express Lanes. Company
officials say a dip in ridership is possible if a new public lane is
added and freeway travel times are improved.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy we could work with Caltrans and OCTA to bring an
improvement to the 91 earlier than would have happened otherwise," said
Greg Hulsizer, general manager of the Express Lanes. "This is what
happens when you cooperate rather than litigate."</TE>
<TE>   The project will add a sixth lane along 1,000 yards of westbound
freeway just east of Coal Canyon Road. Restriping will take place in the
next couple of months to add a temporary lane until the project is
finished in January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The area is now a classic bottleneck because the highway narrows from
six lanes to five for a short distance after entering Orange County.
Traffic slows dramatically as motorists in the carpool lanes merge to the
right to avoid the toll lanes. At the same time, vehicles in the right
lanes are merging to the left.</TE>
<TE>   "That lane drop has been a big problem for commuters," said Corona
Councilman Jeff Miller, who uses the Riverside Freeway to get to work in
Orange County. "Small projects like this can make a huge difference."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the $4 million to compensate the toll lane owners, the
roadwork itself will cost nearly $8 million. That money will be provided
by Caltrans. Under the agreement with the tollway, OCTA buses also will
be able to use the Express Lanes without paying the toll.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say the lane project will be completed at least two
years earlier than contemplated under a court settlement reached a few
years ago after the Express Lanes sued Caltrans to halt a widening
project. The settlement provided for a sixth lane in the project area by
2006 at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Some Riverside County officials have criticized the lane addition,
saying government funds should not be paid to a private company in order
to make a public highway safer and less congested. The county's pending
lawsuit against the tollway and Caltrans alleges that the franchise
agreement is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Bob Buster said the project allows California Private
Transportation Co., the owners of the 91 Express Lanes, to exploit the
franchise agreement to increase revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Others such as Supervisor Tom Mullen welcomed the OCTA project, saying
that people on his side of the county line "should be appreciative of the
fact that Orange County is trying to solve the same problems they are
dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said Wednesday that the money should be repaid if the
authority proceeds with a proposal to buy out the entire tollway. Formal
negotiations for a sale are scheduled to begin this month or in February.</TE>
<TE>   The authority decided to take action on the lane addition after an
Assembly bill to expedite the project stalled in the Legislature. The
measure by Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher (R-Brea) would have authorized the
use of state funds to compensate California Private Transportation for
any loss of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "What OCTA did is exactly what would have happened under my bill,"
Daucher said. "This gives people hope that we will start resolving
long-standing congestion issues on the 91."</TE>

<HD>Cardenas Gets Star Support</HD>
<DH>Election: Candidate announces Disney executives' endorsement to
counter Greuel's DreamWorks backing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The big-screen fight between "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." moved into
the political arena Wednesday as Los Angeles City Council candidate Tony
Cardenas announced backing from Disney chief Michael Eisner to counter
DreamWorks SKG support for his opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas, an assemblyman, hopes a fund-raiser to be sponsored by
Disney Chairman Eisner, Disney President Bob Iger and Motion Picture
Assn. of America President Jack Valenti will counter an event being
planned for his opponent, Wendy Greuel, by the entertainment moguls who
head DreamWorks SKG.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to help my campaign tremendously," Cardenas said.
"[Eisner] is well regarded in the community and a business leader. For
people to see support from Disney helps."</LD>
<TE>   The $500-per-person cocktail reception is scheduled for Feb. 8 at the
Walt Disney Co. headquarters in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Through a spokesman, Eisner and Iger praised Cardenas' work on
educational issues, including the Project Grad scholarship program partly
financed by the Eisner Family Trust.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them believe Tony's support for education programs, pre- and
after-school programs, is very important to our community and the
well-being of Los Angeles," Disney spokesman John Dreyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, a Panorama City Democrat, has courted the entertainment
industry with the help of council President Alex Padilla after Greuel's
film and television connections played a big role in her ability to
outspend the assemblyman in the Dec. 11 primary for the 2nd District
seat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really interesting for insiders because it means money for the
candidates, but I don't think it matters to the average voter," said
Larry Levine, a political consultant who lives in the 2nd District but is
not involved with either campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel and Cardenas are competing in the March 5 runoff to succeed
Joel Wachs, who quit in October. The 2nd District extends from Studio
City to Sunland-Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   In the primary campaign, DreamWorks founders Steven Spielberg, David
Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg held a fund-raiser that netted $50,000 for
Greuel's campaign. More than 100 entertainment industry figures and firms
contributed to Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   Levine and others believe independent expenditures will result in a
lifting of the $275,000 city spending limit in the race--as occurred in
the primary--so the more money candidates can raise, the better.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Buckner, a political consultant for Greuel, downplayed the split
in endorsements, saying she does not believe it's a sign that the
entertainment industry is divided over the council race.</TE>
<TE>   Buckner noted that Greuel won her entertainment industry support
because she worked in the business and has developed friendships. As for
Cardenas, Buckner said, despite the Eisner backing, the assemblyman's
support from the industry is not deep because he does not have the same
ties.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he has that strong a relationship," Buckner said. "I
think it is more of a business relationship involving Alex Padilla."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 3,000-gallon sewage spill closed Little Corona Beach on
Wednesday--the second time this year that a stretch of Orange County's
coastline has been tainted by raw human waste, according to the county
Health Care Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The sewage spilled from a new Irvine Ranch Water District pipeline
about three miles inland in Newport Coast. Sand in the line caused the
spill, which flowed down Buck Gully and into the ocean, according to the
agency.</LD>
<LD>   The spill was reported to health care officials about noon. The ocean
at Little Corona will remain off-limits to swimmers and surfers until
tests show the water is safe.</LD>
<TE>   Swimming in sewage-tainted water can cause gastrointestinal problems
such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; eye, ear, nose and throat
infections; and viral diseases such as hepatitis.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Orange County beaches were closed a record-breaking 51
times by sewage spills.</TE>

<LD>   A 265-foot steel column on the ride collapsed Monday at Cedar Point in
Sandusky, Ohio. The park was closed at the time and no one was injured.
One of three steel towers that supports the ride broke about 65 feet
above the ground. Riders on VertiGo are secured in individual harnesses
before being launched into the air.</LD>

<HD>OCTA OKs $3 Million to Upgrade Call Boxes</HD>
<DH>Transit: Part of plans to retrofit phones for the disabled, the
funds will allow use by the deaf and speech-impaired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving ahead with plans to make highway call boxes more accessible
to the disabled, the Orange County Transportation Authority on Wednesday
earmarked more than $3 million to buy and maintain communication
equipment for the deaf and speech impaired.</LD>
<LD>   Board members unanimously approved a contract with Comarco Wireless
Technologies Inc. to install typewriter-style devices at about 1,200
emergency call boxes in the county. The equipment costs about $2.6
million, and service will run about $450,000 through February 2005.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA officials said the devices will be a vast improvement for the
county's call box system, which was installed in the late 1980s before
passage of federal laws requiring that the disabled have equal access to
public facilities.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an attempt by OCTA to help handicapped motorists," said
George Urch, a spokesman for the authority. "This will give emergency
operators for the California Highway Patrol quick response and the
ability for full communication."</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, OCTA board members launched a program to retrofit
the county's call boxes and improve their accessibility for people in
wheelchairs and for those who have difficulty hearing or speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's effort is part of a growing effort to refit highway
call boxes throughout the state. Advocates for the disabled say many of
the state's 17,000 call boxes do not comply with federal laws to improve
access.</TE>

<HD>Schools Hit Hard in Prop. 13 Ruling</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Capistrano Unified would lose $15.6 million, county auditor
finds. County and fire authority also face blow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's general fund would have to repay $18.6 million in
excessive taxes to property owners if a December court ruling is upheld,
according to an analysis released this week by Auditor-Controller David
Sundstrom.</LD>
<LD>   Also hard hit would be the Capistrano Unified School District and the
Orange County Fire Authority. Capistrano Unified could be forced to
refund as much as $15.6 million to property owners, while the fire
authority could have to repay as much as $12.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sundstrom's analysis represents the first accounting of the court
ruling's possible effect on nearly 300 tax-collecting agencies in Orange
County. Some 49 cities, schools, special districts and redevelopment
agencies potentially would have to refund at least $1 million each.</LD>
<TE>   The auditor previously estimated that about $285 million could be
refunded under the ruling by Superior Court Judge John M. Watson. An
additional $147 million in future revenue would be lost in the first year
of new assessments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Please note that the schedule excludes interest that must be paid
with the refunds," Sundstrom wrote in a letter distributed Tuesday to
each agency. "If the assessor decides not to appeal the decision, the
taxing authorities would have little choice other than to reduce their
revenue projections."</TE>
<TE>   Watson found that some Orange County property assessments violated
Proposition 13, the landmark tax reform measure passed by California
voters in 1978. The judge ruled that the assessor--following a practice
used by his colleagues statewide--illegally raised the assessed value of
a Seal Beach home more than the 2%-a-year limit found in Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   County attorneys defended the practice, used after properties have
dropped in value and their assessments lowered. When the values rebound,
the new assessments routinely exceed the 2% limit--a method called
recapturing.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 against
appealing Watson's ruling. Supervisors said it was up to Assessor Webster
Guillory to defend his assessment practices, and approved his hiring of
private attorneys for an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Guillory said he is still considering an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith, the lone vote on the board in favor of
appealing, said supervisors should reconsider their decision in light of
Sundstrom's new numbers. County attorneys believe Watson's ruling would
be overturned by state justices.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you see why we really need to get a reading from the court,"
Smith said. "We don't want to put these taxing agencies under these dire
straits. We need to get a good solid ruling on this and not depend on one
judge."</TE>
<TE>   But Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who led the board's backing of Watson's
ruling, said he believes that the "recapturing" method of taxing property
is unconstitutional. Smith's argument, he said, is the same as pleading
for a burglar to continue his crimes because the money is needed to feed
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Rob Pool, who owns the Seal Beach home and filed the lawsuit,
has asked Watson to expand the ruling to all taxpayers whose property
assessments increased more than 2% for each of the last four years.
Watson will consider the request Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Watson expands his ruling, it would affect every taxing agency in
Orange County. Though schools would be among the hardest hit, the state
guarantees a minimum level of funding under a separate statewide measure,
Proposition 98, passed in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   If the decision is appealed and ultimately upheld by a higher court,
it could apply statewide. Sundstrom has estimated that refunds statewide
could top $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors last week also directed the assessor, Tax
Collector John M.W. Moorlach and Sundstrom to notify those whose
properties were assessed under the recapturing method during the last
four years that they might have overpaid their taxes. State law allows
taxpayers up to four years to seek refunds.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>Court Case Impact</TE>
<TE>Assessor Webster Guillory is considering whether to appeal a December
ruling by an Orange County Superior Court judge declaring a key
assessment method to be unconstitutional. The method, used by every
assessor in the state, allows property assessments to rise more than
the 2%-a-year limit passed by voters in 1978 if the property dropped
in value and later rebounded. Auditor-Controller David Sundstrom
estimates that, if upheld, county taxing agencies would have to
refund $285 million and lose an additional $147 million in taxes in
the first year. Below is a list of only those agencies that could
face estimated refunds of at least $1 million:</TE>

<HD>Gains on State Tests Slow Down</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Two-thirds of schools in California show slight increases
or declines from last year's results. Experts say that is predictable.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Improvement in statewide achievement scores has slowed as schools
find progress harder to maintain in the third year of California's school
accountability program, an analysis of state data showed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the general movement remained upward statewide, two-thirds of
all schools in California saw their scores decline or made smaller
testing gains last year than in the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers and education leaders said it is natural for the pace of
improvement to ease in testing. But they stressed that elementary schools
serving disadvantaged students have gained the most from
multibillion-dollar educational reforms--even if they find each next step
up harder.</LD>
<TE>   Commonwealth Elementary, a campus of predominantly low-income students
near downtown Los Angeles, for example, shot up 99 points, or 18%,
previously but rose 20 points, or just 3%, in the latest round.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids can really just go so far" each year, said Greg Casino, 40, a
Commonwealth teacher. "We're already pushing the kids hard. We're doing a
lot of test preparation, and they can only do so much."</TE>
<TE>   At Tarzana Elementary in the San Fernando Valley, Principal Roberta
MacAdam said it is no surprise that the first big gains of the
accountability system would be replaced by more modest growth.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only go so far and improve so much," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana, which sits in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, jumped 107
points two years ago, a 20% increase that brought its total score to 638.
Last year, it rose 32 points, a 5% rise.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have robots, you could raise [scores] by 100 points every
year," MacAdam said. "But these are kids. The growth will be slower now
because we had so much of a gain." Both Commonwealth and Tarzana for the
last two years placed in the fifth of the 10 levels into which the state
divides all campuses. Those groupings, with 1 as the lowest and 10 the
highest, are based on their scores on the Stanford 9 basic skills exam.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings were released Wednesday and an analysis by The Times
showed continuing disparities between urban and more suburban campuses. A
majority of schools in Los Angeles County placed in the bottom half of
the 10 divisions. More than half of the schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District were in the bottom three groupings. The situation
is the reverse in more suburban Orange and Ventura counties, which both
can boast of having the majority of their schools in the seventh level
and above.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings are the cornerstone of Gov. Gray Davis' school
accountability system, which is intended to measure academic improvement.
Each of more than 7,000 schools receives a score ranging from 200 to
1,000, based on results from the Stanford 9 exam given each spring. The
goal is 800.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are assigned annual "growth targets," and those that reach or
exceed them are eligible for financial rewards that can include hefty
bonuses of up to $25,000 for individual teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The California system also is designed to give schools in the bottom
rungs an added boost by rewarding them with extra accountability points
for test-score improvements. But low-performing schools that consistently
fail to improve can see their administrators reassigned and face state
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Davis on Wednesday touted the rising accountability scores in the
Academic Performance Index as proof that his reforms are working.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite remarkable that tests are up three years in a row," Davis
told a news conference at John Bidwell Elementary School in Sacramento.
"We believe we've exceeded expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Leading educators echoed Davis' assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The gains are continuing and that's a good thing," said David Rogosa,
a statistician at Stanford University who has analyzed the state's
accountability data. "The schools that need to make improvement are
making improvement. It's a very positive story."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rogosa and other researchers speculated about the causes of the
slower pace of improvement in the most recent round of scores. School
accountability programs typically produce early inflated gains as schools
concentrate on the tests and students and teachers first learn to really
master the mechanics and pacing.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the best places can't keep growth going," said Principal Joan
Blair at Nestle Avenue Elementary, also in Tarzana. "We didn't expect to
make the jump we did the year before again."</TE>
<TE>   The school initially leaped 113 points, a 17% increase that produced a
score of 762. Last year, it grew just three points, a rise of less than
1%. The school ranked in the seventh grouping, dropping one category from
the previous round of testing.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like we're slowing down," said Susan Lasken, who
teaches fifth-grade gifted students at Nestle Avenue. "We're not
addressing the scores per se, we're trying to educate the children."</TE>
<TE>   Some schools countered the trend: More than one quarter of the state's
campuses had bigger gains last year than the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Corvallis Middle School in Norwalk is among them.</TE>
<TE>   Corvallis' accountability score actually dropped two years ago, from
510 to 497, or 2.5%. Last year, the school rose to 553, or 11% up. It
remains in the category second from the bottom in the state rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Jon Lamb attributed the rebound to a sustained
effort to analyze the results of their own regular tests and adapt
teaching techniques accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's release of data included base scores that will be used to
produce a new accountability scale next fall.</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to this report were Times staff writers Dan Morain, Erika
Hayasaki, Andrea Perera, Jennifer Sinco Kelleher, and Times Director of
Computer Analysis Richard O'Reilly and Data Analyst Sandra Poindexter.</TE>

<HD>County Schools Outrank Peers Around State</HD>
<DH>Education: Academic report places 62% of local campuses in the top
half of all statewide; 59% scored better than those with similar
characteristics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County students have once again outperformed their peers
throughout California, this time on an annual academic ranking of public
schools released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   And for the first time this year, the ranking includes results from
more rigorous language-arts tests given to students last spring, rather
than being based solely on the Stanford 9 exam.</LD>
<LD>   Results of the report show that 62% of local campuses placed in the
top half of all schools statewide and that 59% scored better than schools
with similar characteristics.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Ventura County's median Academic Performance Index score
for elementary schools was 722, compared with the statewide median score
of 689. And countywide, more than 25% of schools have achieved one state
goal--an API score of 800--while statewide the figure is 18%.</TE>
<TE>   In the academic ranking, schools received a score of 1 to 10, with a 1
representing the bottom 10% of schools and 10 the top 10%. Elementary,
middle and high schools are ranked against each other.</TE>
<TE>   Because the numbers are based on a new formula, comparisons should not
be made with scores from past years, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Within Ventura County, however, the rankings again illustrated the
ever-present performance gap between the affluent east county and the
more blue-collar west.</TE>
<TE>   In the Conejo Valley Unified School District in Thousand Oaks, for
example, more than half the schools earned a 10. In the similar-sized
Ventura Unified School District, only 8% achieved the same ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Weis, Ventura County's superintendent of schools, said the focus
for the area's lower-performing schools should be meeting their targets
for improvement, which were also published in Wednesday's report.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools need to already be focusing on doing whatever it takes to
meet these targets," Weis said. "If schools do it across the state, it
will be closing the gap. And that's the whole purpose of this thing."</TE>
<TE>   He added that inclusion of the California Standards Test scores, the
language-arts test that made up 36% of the 2001 API, is a big step for
the state's accountability program. In the past, the program has been
criticized for basing schools' rewards and sanctions on a single test
that did not necessarily match what they were told to teach.</TE>
<TE>   "The standards tests are a better measure," Weis said.</TE>
<TE>   Also encouraging, he said, is that nearly 60% of the schools scored in
the top half of the similar-schools ranking, which means they are doing
better than campuses facing similar challenges: poverty, large
populations of students learning English and high pupil mobility rates.</TE>
<TE>   "To a parent, that should say if you put your child in our schools,
they are on average going to do better here than in someone else's
schools," Weis said.</TE>
<TE>   One example is Rio Elementary, a small school district in the rural
outskirts of Oxnard, where schools that were ranked 2, 3 and 5 on the
statewide list received 6s and 8s on the similar-schools ranking.</TE>
<TE>   "We did phenomenally well--I am very pleased," said David Lopez, an
assistant superintendent. "It's saying that we're making improvement a
school-wide focus."</TE>
<TE>   Another is Manzanita Elementary in Thousand Oaks, which earned a 6 on
the state ranking but a 10 among similar campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings can serve as validation for schools in poor areas or
where populations of parents who don't speak English are high, said
Robert Fraisse, superintendent of the Hueneme Elementary School District.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he said, the report serves as a reminder about the
importance of boosting scores on the standardized tests that all second-
through 11th-graders will take in March and April.</TE>
<TE>   "It emphasizes that the state's taking it seriously," Fraisse said,
"and that we can't let our resolve down to continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Major improvement is becoming more and more difficult for schools in
the highest-performing districts. In 2001, 43% of schools in Ventura
County showed less improvement on the API than they demonstrated in
previous years, according to a Times analysis of the data.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon also makes similar-school ranking comparisons less
meaningful for those schools, said Mike Vollmert, testing coordinator in
Conejo Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Banyan Elementary in Thousand Oaks was ranked a 10 among
all schools in the state, but only a 5 when compared with similar
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Making something out of those numbers is like arguing over whether
Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant is a better basketball player--I'll take
either one of them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the greatest challenges exist for campuses struggling in the
lower 10% of schools statewide, educators said. In Ventura County, those
are mostly in the poorest areas of Oxnard and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Elm Street School in Oxnard, where students hiked the school's API a
whopping 97 points from last year, is still within the lowest rank--both
statewide and among similar schools.</TE>
<TE>   The school is doing the best it can, said Principal Rafael Perez.
Specialists have been working more with at-risk students in reading,
language and math sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Although outsiders judge his school on the API scores, "my priority is
to make sure the kids are learning," Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Many school officials Wednesday agreed that one score or one rank
alone does not say much about the quality of education at a school or
within a district.</TE>
<TE>   "The API is a political construct with political motivations,"
Vollmert said. "We can get some good data out of this to help individual
kids, but that's not in the API."</TE>

<TE>Ventura County Schools Outperform State Peers in API</TE>
<TE>   What Is the API?</TE>
<TE>   California's Academic Performance Index is the cornerstone of Gov.
Gray Davis' push to hold schools accountable for student performance.</TE>
<TE>   The API summarizes the performance on two key exams given last spring
to about 4.3 million students: the 2001 Stanford 9, a standardized basic
skills test, and a new test based on California's rigorous English and
language arts standards.</TE>
<TE>   The scores form a base for determining whether schools qualify for
future rewards or sanctions. This fall, schools will learn whether they
met their academic goals based on tests taken in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Readers who want to know how a school in Ventura County is faring can
use this index as a gauge.</TE>
<TE>   Results for all schools and districts in California are available on
the World Wide Web at http://http://api.cde.ca.gov/</TE>
<TE>How to Read These Tables</TE>
<TE>   * Find the school district. Districts are listed in alphabetical
order.</TE>
<TE>   * Search for the individual school.</TE>
<TE>   * For each school, the table first lists the 2001 API score, on a
scale of 200 to 1,000. Two asterisks (**) indicate problems with the
tested population or data irregularities; for more information, call the
school or visit the API Web site.</TE>
<TE>   * Next comes a statewide ranking, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1
representing the bottom 10% of schools and 10 the top 10%. All elementary
schools are ranked together, as are middle schools and high schools.</TE>
<TE>   * The third column is a second ranking comparing the school with a
group of 100 other schools that are similar in certain regards, such as
poverty rate, the number of English-language learners, pupil mobility and
percentage of teachers with emergency credentials.</TE>
<TE>   * The final column lists the target score for the next API report, due
in the fall. An asterisk (*) indicates that a school is at or above 800.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Greet Runners Carrying Olympic Torch</HD>
<DH>Relay: Among the 46 holding aloft the flame in Oxnard and Ventura
are a lightweight boxer, a Canadian contest winner and a breast cancer
survivor.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a break from jobs and school, thousands of jubilant Ventura
County residents witnessed history on the hoof Wednesday as torchbearers
holding aloft the Olympic flame wended their way through wildly cheering,
flag-waving crowds.</LD>
<LD>   Lighted in Olympia, Greece, in November, the flame was flown to
Atlanta, the site of the most recent Olympic Games in the United States.
It has been transported to places as large as Los Angeles and as small as
Hickory, N.C., with about 12,000 torchbearers each carrying the symbol of
global harmony for two-tenths of a mile, about the length of 3 1/2
football fields.</LD>
<LD>   Eager for the spectacle on Wednesday, Anne Viera hauled her three
daughters in a stroller and a baby carrier to Ventura's Main Street,
where Ventura High School cheerleaders performed routines beneath an
immense archway of balloons in their school's colors of black and gold.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like the fair parade," Viera explained to 7-year-old Allison.
"Only now, it's the whole world getting together."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of students drifted in and out of a rally at the high school,
listening to music and playing hockey with broomsticks. Down the street,
Ojai postal worker Reba Seba darted onto the sidewalk from beneath a hair
dryer at the Self Image beauty salon.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could sneak out here without being noticed," said Seba,
wearing foil coverings in her hair and a black smock. "I just didn't want
to miss out on anything."</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, the caldron bearing the Olympic flame arrived by truck from
Pasadena an hour past schedule. It will follow a dipsy-doodle course to
the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, proceeding up the coast to Washington
and being flown to Alaska before finally arriving at the opening ceremony
Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   At the flame's Ventura County launch point, a Chevrolet dealership off
Oxnard Boulevard, a mariachi band pumped up the crowd and street vendors
hawked everything from U.S. flags to plastic Olympic medals.</TE>
<TE>   As the convoy and its police escorts drew near, 19-year-old David
Rodela made his way to the starting line and became an instant celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard resident, a lightweight boxer who aspires to compete in the
2004 Olympics, was chosen to kick off the county's link in the nationwide
relay. A crowd hungry for photos and autographs mobbed him. When he
lighted his torch, the crowd urged him along with a spontaneous chant:
"USA! USA! USA!"</TE>
<TE>   True to his word, Rodela walked his segment of the relay, savoring
every step.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to enjoy a great moment," he said afterward, dressed in
his white Olympic sweatsuit and holding onto the silver torch cylinder,
its flame now extinguished. "This is going to be a day I remember until
they put me in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The 46 torchbearers in Oxnard and Ventura were chosen in different
ways. Shauna Peters, a 20-year-old university student from London,
Ontario, won a drawing sponsored by a Canadian restaurant chain. Peters
loped past Ventura High, assigned that segment arbitrarily by the relay's
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Others were nominated by their friends and families because they had
acted selflessly or overcome staggering adversities.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, Terry White was cheered on by her family as she rounded a
downtown corner. The 39-year-old Palmdale woman summed up her jog with a
breathless "Wonderful!"--a simple description that is especially
meaningful for a woman who has endured seven brain surgeries in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Running up the steps at City Hall, Nadine Parsons of Fort Worth beamed
as she used her torch to light the one carried by her mother, Sharon
Troll. A breast cancer survivor, Troll works for the Boys &amp; Girls Club of
Ventura on programs to keep youths out of gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Before her run, Troll picked a spot on her mantel for the torch she
would use. Participants could buy their torches for $335.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just awed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Children from the Boys &amp; Girls Club shouted words of encouragement.
The Buena High School band performed and 100 white doves were released to
celebrate the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, Kevin Crouch's cheering section included his sister-in-law
Cindy Mauricio, who had come all the way from Hawaii to see the
39-year-old corrections officer do his part for the Olympics. She and two
dozen others carried red, white and blue posters with his face and the
words: "We Love You Kevin."</TE>
<TE>   The Bakersfield man was nominated by his wife Bonnie, mainly because
he donated one of his kidneys to a female relative. With a new hold on
life, for at least a few years, the woman saw her children get married
and her grandchildren born.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real loving man," said Mauricio. "Yup, he's the bomb."</TE>
<TE>   The day's carnival atmosphere was punctuated with poignant
observations. For many, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks weren't far from
mind.</TE>
<TE>   In green hospital scrubs, Don Lake, an intensive-care nurse at Ventura
County Medical Center, recognized the day's bittersweet undertone as he
stood on a sidewalk in Ventura, waiting for the procession to come
through.</TE>
<TE>   "With all that's going on in the world, this is pretty special right
now," he said. "I'm behind anything that brings the country together a
little more."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the day's novelty couldn't be denied.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ventura you'll see just about anything," joked Leslie Garrett, a
waitress at the Vagabond coffee shop downtown. "Someone running down the
street with something that's on fire--not unusual. But the Olympic torch:
Now, that's really a big deal!"</TE>

<HD>Rapist Arrested in $12 Theft</HD>
<DH>Crime: Santa Paula man is charged with a felony. He faces
three-strikes law if convicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted rapist from Santa Paula who was among the state's first
inmates held under a law locking up sex offenders beyond their prison
term is back in jail on suspicion of stealing wine, mouthwash and lip
balm from a grocery store, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The total value of the items came to less than $12 but Ronald Steven
Herrera, 56, was charged with a felony after the Carpinteria incident
earlier this month because "he walked into the store with the intent to
steal something," Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt.
Jim Dollar said.</LD>
<LD>   Herrera also threatened the deputy who was taking him to jail, Dollar
said, adding that Herrera remains in Santa Barbara County Jail without
bail.</LD>
<TE>   Herrera pleaded not guilty to the charges Jan. 8 and faces a Jan. 22
preliminary hearing in Santa Barbara Superior Court, Deputy Public
Defender Jeff Chambliss said.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Herrera could be sentenced to prison for 25 years to
life because a third felony on his record would make him eligible for the
three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   David Lehr, a senior deputy district attorney who had argued in
November that Herrera should remain incarcerated, said he had expected
Herrera to get arrested again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised it took this long," Lehr said. "I thought it was going
to be about a week. All I can say is, 'Thank God.' This man has the
potential to hurt people."</TE>
<TE>   Herrera has a lengthy criminal record in Ventura County and Virginia
that includes the 1971 rape of a woman and her 15-year-old daughter
during a home-invasion robbery at a Ventura Beach cottage.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his conviction on those rapes, Herrera escaped with
three other inmates from the Oxnard jail. He fled to Virginia, where he
was arrested and sentenced to 50 years in prison for a series of
minimarket robberies, including one in which he shot a police officer,
Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   After serving 13 years of that sentence, Herrera was paroled and
returned to Ventura County and sent to state prison on the Ventura rape
charges. He served eight years and eight months in prison for those
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Before his prison release in 1996, he was ordered to the hospital
under terms of the Sexually Violent Predator Act, which allowed
prosecutors to place repeat sexual offenders in state hospitals for
two-year increments.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Herrera was released from Atascadero State Hospital after
doctors concluded he no longer could be considered a violent sexual
predator.</TE>

<HD>Defense Wary of Jury Pool</HD>
<DH>Court: Lawyers for a man accused of killing a college student want
prospective jurors polled to determine whether news reports on the case
have affected them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense lawyers want to poll prospective Ventura County jurors to
gauge whether news reports about serial rapist and murder suspect Vincent
Sanchez have tainted the local jury pool.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, 31, is scheduled to stand trial on first-degree murder
charges in March. He could face the death penalty if convicted of
shooting to death college student Megan Barroso, 20, during an alleged
kidnapping and rape attempt.</LD>
<LD>   His lawyers want the trial moved out of Ventura County, arguing
newspaper and television coverage has biased prospective jurors.
Prosecutors are opposing the request.</LD>
<TE>   During a court hearing Wednesday, Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil
Quinn suggested polling men and women called for jury duty next month to
gauge whether they have been swayed by pretrial publicity.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, which would be voluntary, would occur several weeks before
Sanchez's trial and would not involve anyone who might serve as a juror
in his case.</TE>
<TE>   Such a poll was used a few years ago in the Diana Haun murder case,
which was decided by a Santa Barbara jury because of concerns over
excessive pretrial publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, an unemployed carpenter, recently pleaded guilty to numerous
sex-assault counts and admitted being the long-pursued Simi Valley rapist
who attacked nearly a dozen women during the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   In a motion filed last month, defense attorneys contend local
residents have been prejudiced by 225 newspaper articles about the Simi
Valley rapes and the fatal shooting of Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   Barroso died after being pulled from her bullet-riddled car near
Moorpark in the early morning of July 5. Her body was found a month later
in a ravine. Prosecutors contend she was a victim of an attempted rape
and kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   In a response motion filed last week, prosecutors accuse the defense
of exaggerating the claims of excessive publicity. A hearing on that
issue has not been set.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says Farm Illegally Fired Worker</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge with the Agricultural Labor Relations Board has ruled that
the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Ventura illegally fired a mushroom picker
engaged in organizing activities for the United Farm Workers union.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-page ruling was delivered last week by Administrative Law Judge
Douglas Gallop. Gallop said that during three days of testimony last fall
state prosecutors proved the firing of Fidel Andrade violated provisions
of a state law. That law prohibits agricultural employers from
interfering with union organizing activities.</LD>
<LD>   Andrade, 44, an ardent supporter of the United Farm Workers, was fired
in May from his job of nine years. Pictsweet and the UFW have been locked
in a protracted labor dispute over wages and benefits.</LD>
<TE>   The judge said Pictsweet should offer Andrade his job back and
reimburse him for lost wages. Company officials, who could not be reached
Wednesday to comment, can appeal the decision to the state labor board.</TE>

<HD>Expo Offers Latest in Combat Wear</HD>
<DH>Marines: High-tech helmets, boots and other items bring firms and
customers together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAMP PENDLETON
</DL>
<LD>Laser-guided rockets and 21st century satellite phones are
important, but Marines still come equipped with two feet and a skull--and
the comfort of each remains of great importance to the owner.</LD>
<LD>   And so, not surprisingly, the most popular booths at Wednesday's ninth
annual Marine West Military Exposition here involved new protective gear
for the extremities of combat Marines.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the wares of military-industrial giants such as General Dynamics,
Lockheed-Martin and Raytheon, there were also three companies with
footwear that they insist will prevent blisters, jungle rot and split
toenails.</LD>
<TE>   There was also a company from Scappoose, Ore., that has devised a
foam-padded liner and improved chin strap to keep military helmets from
shifting and flopping and generally driving the wearer crazy.</TE>
<TE>   If you have worn a military helmet, you wouldn't have to ask why the
product, called the Ballistic Liner Suspension System, was instantly
popular with the troops in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually comfortable," an amazed Cpl. Michael Franz said as he
tried on a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't jiggle around," said Cpl. Jeremy Peniston.</TE>
<TE>   True, as Marine musicians in the band at Twentynine Palms--Franz plays
the trombone, Peniston the trumpet--the two corporals do not have
occasion to wear their helmets all that often.</TE>
<TE>   But like all Marines, Franz and Peniston are trained riflemen and thus
have stories to tell about helmets that slip over eyes, loll from side to
side, and get hotter than Palm Springs in August.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody hates their helmets," said Russ Monk, a production design
coordinator from Oregon Aero Inc., developer of the helmet liner.</TE>
<TE>   The military has done a lot to improve the helmet since the days when
it was basically a pot turned upside down. Some troops, though, insist
that the webbing and padding have not kept pace.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a modern, Kevlar helmet with World War II era webbing," said
Maj. Gene Augustine, an infantry officer. "Everybody would like something
better."</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps is buying a sturdy, flame-resistant, buoyant,
lightweight (2.5 pounds to 3.7 pounds, depending on size) helmet with a
10-year guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Each helmet, made by a Pennsylvania company, will have a liner made by
Oregon Aero, which also makes a variety of military products, including
crash helmets worn by aviators.</TE>
<TE>   But it takes awhile for new equipment to filter throughout the
fighting force. So, until all the troops get the new helmet and liner,
Oregon Aero is trying to interest the military in a liner retrofit kit.
If the Department of Defense doesn't bite, Plan B would be to market the
kit directly to the troops, retailing at about $100.</TE>
<TE>   Which is what brought Monk and other Oregon Aero salesmen to the
exposition, an annual gathering of defense industry equipment and
technology suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day confab, sponsored by the Marine Corps League, an alumni
association for former Marines, brings together suppliers and their
customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The exhibitors get a chance to talk face to face with the Marines who
will be using their products," said retired Marine Lt. Gen. Stephen G.
Olmstead, the exposition coordinator. "It's not generals that count in
these things; it's regular Marines."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 70-plus companies at the exposition are hawking products
that only the Defense Department could afford or want. It is highly
doubtful that many troops could buy their own precision targeting system
for a lightweight 155-mm howitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Other products--boots, gun belts, cold-weather gear, individual water
bags ("Hydrate or Die"), weapon-cleaning solvents--are probably destined
for retail stores for Marines and Marine wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   There are several selling points to the helmet liner retrofit kit. One
is that the liner dissipates heat and carries away sweat.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the promise of enhanced protection. Tests have shown
that the padded foam liner absorbs much of the shock of a direct hit from
a rock, bullet or other projectile better than its predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll get your bell rung, but you'll survive," said Monk. "We had a
guy do a lawn dart and survive."</TE>
<TE>   Doing a lawn dart is a military term for taking a headfirst fall from
a significant height and ending up with your head buried in dirt. You get
the picture.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Plans Trust Fund for Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH>Investment: The proposal, to be unveiled today, would set aside
$100 million by 2003-04 fiscal year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn is scheduled to release a plan today for
creating a $100-million trust fund to build affordable housing in Los
Angeles, fulfilling a years-long dream of local housing advocates.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the City Council, Hahn's plan would increase the city's
relatively paltry investment in housing to the largest of any city in the
nation by fiscal year 2003-04, advocates said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a huge commitment," Hahn said in an interview Wednesday. "You're
going to see this [administration] putting housing much higher on the
list of priorities in the city than it's been in the past."</LD>
<TE>   The fund will grow within two years to the $100-million level
recommended by housing advocates, without imposing new fees or taxes on
either developers or residents, the Hahn administration said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing it in a way that I think is very doable and very
realistic given the city's financial picture," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has already won the support of many housing advocates,
who have pushed the concept of an affordable-housing trust fund over a
long and sometimes bumpy road.</TE>
<TE>   "This is victory with a capital V," said Jan Breidenbach, of Housing
LA, the group leading the campaign. "This is what Housing LA has been
working for for the last 3 1/2 years."</TE>
<TE>   Alvivon Hurd, a tenant leader with the Assn. of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, called the mayor's proposal a
good start.</TE>
<TE>   "We are glad that the city has begun to take seriously their
obligation to address the housing crisis," Hurd said.</TE>
<TE>   The housing fund would create a permanent source of money to build
affordable housing and maintain the current stock of reasonably priced
units. According to housing experts, the city needs to build nearly 4,000
units a year to meet increasing demand.</TE>
<TE>   The trust fund is designed to stabilize funding that has fluctuated
badly and eliminate the need for advocates to lobby each year for more
money.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's proposal suggests a graduated approach to reaching $100
million and taps a variety of sources. Currently the fund stands at $10
million. By the 2002-03 budget, the fund is supposed to increase to $52.9
million, and to $100 million the year after that.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office said that it was still finalizing its plan Wednesday and
that some of the specifics could change slightly by its release today.</TE>
<TE>   The money would come from many sources, including the hotel tax,
Community Redevelopment Agency funds, federal community development block
grants and an anticipated increase in collection of city business taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Also augmenting the fund would be an increased share of vehicle
license fees.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year, $5 million in federal block grants a year would be
redirected to housing from other city departments that do not spend the
cash promptly. In future years, the housing trust would receive a
guaranteed $5 million from the federal source.</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn plan also incorporates a proposal by Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas to use money from the sale of city properties to build
housing. Currently, money from such sales is spread among City Council
offices.</TE>
<TE>   The share of property taxes in redevelopment areas that goes to
housing would be increased from 20% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   The housing trust fund would also benefit beginning in the next fiscal
year, when it's scheduled to receive about $10 million a year from the
city's portion of a $206-billion settlement paid by the tobacco industry
to California and 45 other states.</TE>
<TE>   The use of tobacco funds for non-health related issues is justified,
"because of the public health impact of lack of affordable housing," said
Deputy Mayor Carmel Sella, who worked on the proposal.</TE>
<TE>'Linkage Fees' Not Included in Plan</TE>
<TE>   Absent from the proposal are sources such as "linkage fees," which
would have increased costs for housing developers. Hahn has long held
that linkage fees, levied on commercial developers for any additional
housing demands created by construction, would only be considered as a
last resort.</TE>
<TE>   "I've found another way," Hahn said. "We don't need to go there. . . .
It's important to me not to saddle businesses with new fees and new
taxes. I want to revive Los Angeles' economy and keep it moving in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Business interests praised Hahn's avoidance of such charges.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor "recognizes that the sources of an affordable housing fund
have to be ones that encourage growth and not chill it," said Carol E.
Schatz, president of the Central City Assn., a business advocacy group.
"The whole idea is to produce more housing."</TE>
<TE>   Although the City Council still must vote on the proposal, members
strongly supported the concept last year and advocates say the support is
there.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas called the mayor's proposal "prudent and progressive."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the council has a receptive disposition to this proposal, and
now that we have specifics with which to deal, it just makes it easier,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti also applauded the mayor, but said some
members may search for supplementary sources of funding.</TE>
<TE>   Some members "really wanted to make sure we looked under every single
rock," Garcetti said. "Some of them may not be convinced that we have."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of charging developers fees to expand the housing fund has
not been ruled out and may be revisited in the future, Garcetti added.</TE>
<TE>   The first-term councilman said the key now is to "keep a watchful eye
on city departments to make sure they can now put up the units that are
so badly needed."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's proposal represents a major step forward for housing
advocates who pushed the issue to center stage during the mayoral and
council races.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's prospects seemed to dim after the attacks of Sept. 11 and
subsequent projections of a city budget deficit of $156 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real concern of ours," Hahn said. "I was going to be
realistic about it. If we could not close that budget gap, initiating a
new program like this would have been very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   But a hiring freeze and other measures have helped close the gap, Hahn
said.</TE>
<TE>Fund Would Mirror Those in Other Cities</TE>
<TE>   With the proposal, the mayor makes good on a campaign promise and has
won the support of many housing advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he would have $100 million before the end of his
administration and he will have it before the last year of his first
term," Breidenbach said.</TE>
<TE>   The beefed-up fund places Los Angeles in league with other cities that
have set up affordable-housing trust funds, said Mary Brooks of the
Center for Community Change, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that it will be able to produce a significant
number of new units and definitely help in terms of improving the
condition of existing housing stock," Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 170 city, county and state housing trust funds in
cities nationwide, including Sacramento, Palo Alto, Seattle, Chicago and
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the mayor is expected to meet with U.S. Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development Mel Martinez to discuss the city's housing
needs.</TE>
<TE>   The city's commitment to the trust fund will increase its ability to
lobby for what Hahn called its fair share of federal and state housing
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got our commitment on the table," Hahn said. "We've got our
ante in this game."</TE>

<HD>Gains on State Tests Slow Down at Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Two-thirds of campuses in the state show slight
increases or declines from last year's results. Experts say that is
predictable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Improvement in statewide achievement scores has slowed as schools
find progress harder to maintain in the third year of California's school
accountability program, an analysis of state data showed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the general movement remained upward statewide, two-thirds of
all schools in California saw their scores decline or made smaller
testing gains last year than in the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers and education leaders said it is natural for the pace of
improvement to ease in testing. But they stressed that elementary schools
serving disadvantaged students have gained the most from
multibillion-dollar educational reforms--even if they find each next step
up harder.</LD>
<TE>   Commonwealth Elementary, a campus of predominantly low-income students
near downtown Los Angeles, for example, shot up 99 points, or 18%,
previously but rose 20 points, or just 3%, in the latest round.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids can really just go so far" each year, said Greg Casino, 40, a
Commonwealth teacher. "We're already pushing the kids hard. We're doing a
lot of test preparation, and they can only do so much."</TE>
<TE>   At Tarzana Elementary in the San Fernando Valley, Principal Roberta
MacAdam said it is no surprise that the first big gains of the
accountability system would be replaced by more modest growth.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only go so far and improve so much," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana, which sits in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, jumped 107
points two years ago, a 20% increase that brought its total score to 638.
Last year, it rose 32 points, a 5% rise.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have robots, you could raise [scores] by 100 points every
year," MacAdam said. "But these are kids. The growth will be slower now
because we had so much of a gain."</TE>
<TE>   Both Commonwealth and Tarzana for the last two years placed in the
fifth of the 10 levels into which the state divides all campuses. Those
groupings, with 1 as the lowest and 10 the highest, are based on their
scores on the Stanford 9 basic skills exam.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings were released Wednesday and an analysis by The Times
showed continuing disparities between urban and more suburban campuses. A
majority of schools in Los Angeles County placed in the bottom half of
the 10 divisions. More than half of the schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District were in the bottom three groupings. The situation
is the reverse in more suburban Orange and Ventura counties, which both
can boast of having the majority of their schools in the seventh level
and above.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings are the cornerstone of Gov. Gray Davis' school
accountability system, which is intended to measure academic improvement.
Each of more than 7,000 schools receives a score ranging from 200 to
1,000, based on results from the Stanford 9 exam given each spring. The
goal is 800.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are assigned annual "growth targets," and those that reach or
exceed them are eligible for financial rewards that can include hefty
bonuses of up to $25,000 for individual teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The California system also is designed to give schools in the bottom
rungs an added boost by rewarding them with extra accountability points
for test-score improvements. But low-performing schools that consistently
fail to improve can see their administrators reassigned and face state
takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Davis on Wednesday touted the rising accountability scores in the
Academic Performance Index as proof that his reforms are working.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite remarkable that tests are up three years in a row," Davis
told a news conference at John Bidwell Elementary School in Sacramento.
"We believe we've exceeded expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Leading educators echoed Davis' assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "The gains are continuing and that's a good thing," said David Rogosa,
a statistician at Stanford University who has analyzed the state's
accountability data. "The schools that need to make improvement are
making improvement. It's a very positive story."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rogosa and other researchers speculated about the causes of the
slower pace of improvement in the most recent round of scores. School
accountability programs typically produce early inflated gains as schools
concentrate on the tests and students and teachers first learn to really
master the mechanics and pacing.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the best places can't keep growth going," said Principal Joan
Blair at Nestle Avenue Elementary, also in Tarzana. "We didn't expect to
make the jump we did the year before again."</TE>
<TE>   The school initially leaped 113 points, a 17% increase that produced a
score of 762. Last year, it grew just three points, a rise of less than
1%. The school ranked in the seventh grouping, dropping one category from
the previous round of testing.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like we're slowing down," said Susan Lasken, who
teaches fifth-grade gifted students at Nestle Avenue. "We're not
addressing the scores per se, we're trying to educate the children."</TE>
<TE>   Some schools countered the trend: More than one quarter of the state's
campuses had bigger gains last year than the year before.</TE>
<TE>   Corvallis Middle School in Norwalk is among them.</TE>
<TE>   Corvallis' accountability score actually dropped two years ago, from
510 to 497, or 2.5%. Last year, the school rose to 553, or 11% up. It
remains in the category second from the bottom in the state rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Principal Jon Lamb attributed the rebound to a sustained
effort to analyze the results of their own regular tests and adapt
teaching techniques accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Separate from the Stanford 9 exams, Corvallis students are tested
three times a year in reading, and twice a year in language usage and
mathematics. The school forwards the results to Norwalk-La Mirada Unified
School District headquarters. A profile for each student is then returned
to teachers so they can tailor instruction to student's strengths and
weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "In math, if you have a difficulty in problem-solving strategies, I as
a teacher can target that," said Bunker Hill, an eighth-grade algebra and
science teacher and the assessment liaison to the district.</TE>
<TE>   Students said the targeted instruction makes a difference when the
Stanford 9 is given.</TE>
<TE>   "The [teachers] are always telling us, 'This will be on the Stanford
9. You have to remember,' " said Melody Ry, 13, the student body
president at Corvallis.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's release of data included base scores that will be used to
produce a new accountability scale next fall.</TE>

schools can be viewed at http://http://api.cde.ca.gov</TE>

<HD>A Son Has Been Waiting 26 Years for Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five weeks ago, I wrote a column telling Sara Jane Olson to spare
us the tiresome woe-is-me act regarding her days and nights with the
Symbionese Liberation Army.</LD>
<LD>   If she wanted the court's mercy for trying to blow up police cars in
L.A., I said, Olson ought to spill the beans on who gunned down an
innocent woman in 1975 during a Carmichael bank robbery.</LD>
<LD>   The day the column appeared, I got this message:</LD>
<TE>   "Thanks for refocusing the issue on my mom's unresolved murder by the
SLA."</TE>
<TE>   It was from Jon Opsahl.</TE>
<TE>   For 26 years, the Riverside physician and father of four had kept his
mother's memory alive and campaigned for her murderers to be brought to
justice.</TE>
<TE>   It was no whodunit, he argued. It was an SLA job all the way, and
anyone who wanted the details could read Patty Hearst's book, because she
claimed to have driven the getaway car.</TE>
<TE>   Or they could check out a Web site that was half tribute to Opsahl's
mother and half indictment of prosecutors for sitting on their hands.
"Justice for Myrna Opsahl's murder has been denied for over 26 years,"
reads a printable postcard on the site, and it's addressed to the
Sacramento County District Attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl was either snubbed by authorities or was told there simply was
not enough evidence to arrest his mother's killers.</TE>
<TE>   What more did they need? he wondered.</TE>
<TE>   On the Web site, next to a photo of his smiling mother, was a quote
that has torn Opsahl apart for a quarter of a century. It is from the
book "Every Secret Thing" by Hearst, who was quoting the alleged killer,
Emily Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, she's dead, but it really doesn't matter. She's a bourgeois pig
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Jon Opsahl finally got the first piece of the justice he
has been waiting for. Four former SLA members, including Sara Jane Olson,
were arrested and charged with the murder of his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Mission accomplished," Opsahl told me before boarding a plane to
Sacramento, where he attended the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't know, and it's still not entirely clear, what developments
led to the arrests. If Olson ratted out her former buddies in an attempt
to cushion her own fall, he wasn't aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   The D.A. said the arrests were based on a review of both old and new
evidence. Opsahl wasn't all that interested in the particulars. At the
news conference, he sat with his father, also a physician, and then spoke
for both of them when he said of the arrests:</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who has claimed she gave money to SLA members back in the 1970s
when her name was Kathleen Ann Soliah, has insisted she had nothing to do
with any murder and was not at the bank where Opsahl was killed.</TE>
<TE>   But in Hearst's book, the former newspaper heiress puts Olson in the
bank with three SLA members.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Sara Jane was right there," Opsahl said. "And I believe she
kicked one of the tellers, who happened to be pregnant and ended up
having a miscarriage. She was in the bank with a gun, she and the others,
and they let my mother bleed to death on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl was shot, according to Hearst's book, when a nervous and
trigger-happy Emily Harris allegedly emptied her shotgun into Opsahl's
side.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hearst's account, one SLA member was later quite grateful
that Opsahl happened to step in front of the trigger-happy Harris, or an
SLA soldier could have been lost.</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been for good ol' Myrna," Hearst wrote, quoting Bill
Harris, "one of our comrades would be dead now. Good old Myrna, she took
all the buckshot."</TE>
<TE>   Jon Opsahl, 15, was in school at Sacramento Union Academy on that day
in 1975. In an irony he would never get over, he had been assigned by his
school newspaper to report on the mysterious doings of the Symbionese
Liberation Army.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't figure out what they were really about, he says. Not then.
Not now.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse came for him and brought him to the principal's office,
where his younger brother, Roy, and older sister, Sonia, were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "We were driven without a word to the hospital," says Jon Opsahl. None
of them knew what for, but they figured it must have something to do with
their father, a surgeon at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea until I saw my Dad crying, and he told us my mother
was dead."</TE>
<TE>   She had been a pillar, Jon says. His father was always at work, and
his mother handled everything at home, attended all their school
activities, kept them active in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 42, or I will be in March, and my mother was 42 when she was
killed," Jon told me, talking by cell phone. "That's one of the strange
things about this: realizing how my mom lost out on the best years of her
life, being killed at 42, with four children and a husband."</TE>
<TE>   In June of 1999, Sara Jane Olson/Soliah was arrested in St. Paul,
Minn., after more than 20 years on the lam. As both a defense and a plea
for clemency, her supporters offered up the story of Olson's All-American
life.</TE>
<TE>   She had married a doctor. She was involved in her community. She was
the happy, doting mother of three children.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, she had become like Jon Opsahl's mother, the
"bourgeois" woman she and her comrades are now charged with murdering.</TE>

<HD>Trial Drones On, One Signature Moment at a Time</HD>
<DH>Courts: After theatrical early days, a challenge of Compton's
mayoral vote seems an endless loop of ballot-by-ballot battles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the boiler room of the legal process, its unglamorous side,
the trenches.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred votes cast in Compton's June mayoral election are
being challenged as illegal, so now a judge, city officials and several
attorneys are reviewing them.</LD>
<LD>   One at a time.</LD>
<TE>   Last June, Eric Perrodin ran against incumbent Omar Bradley in the
Compton mayoral race. Perrodin won by 261 votes. Bradley filed a lawsuit
challenging the election.</TE>
<TE>   The early days of the trial, which started in November, were classic
courtroom theater. Accusations of conspiracy and voter fraud flew, and
news cameras bobbed after attorneys exiting the courtroom. A star
witness, expected to support Bradley's case, stunned the courtroom by
offering damaging testimony against him instead.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, the star witnesses and the cameras are gone. Absent
as well are the impassioned speech, the shouted objection, the pounded
gavel.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley Hertz, is still trying to overturn the
election, not in one fell swoop, but ballot by painstakingly examined
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   He says signatures on at least 560 voter registration documents don't
match those on absentee ballots and precinct rosters, and that Compton
City Clerk Charles Davis abused his discretion by allowing those votes to
be counted.</TE>
<TE>   For the past week, Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin has tried to
determine if those votes, cast in June, contested in August and hauled to
court in boxes in November, should count.</TE>
<TE>   Each day is nearly the same. In the morning, Davis takes the stand.
The signatures from the voter registration cards and other documents are
paired for comparison and placed on an overhead projector.</TE>
<TE>   Like bugs under a microscope, they transform into impossibly
complicated creatures, bristling with legs and spines.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hertz had questions. As he does every time a pair of
signatures flashes on the screen, he argued the signatures didn't match.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Davis," he said, "do you notice any differences in the 'G' in
these two signatures?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, Compton's city clerk since 1973, had examined the day's batch
of signatures beforehand and made notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it appears to be more spread out on the ballot envelope," he
said. Still, he said, they were a match.</TE>
<TE>   Letter by letter, the comparison continues. First name, middle
initial, last name.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys and judge compare the quirks of penmanship, in all their
variety. Letters tilted at odd angles, bunched together in clumps,
veering off in corkscrew flourishes.</TE>
<TE>   Silent under the scrutiny, the paired groupings of loops and whorls
are poked and prodded for clues. Were they both created by the hand of
the legally registered voter they are supposed to represent?</TE>
<TE>   After Davis gives his opinion, Judge Chirlin agrees, disagrees or
postpones her judgment, placing the votes in piles designated "legal,"
"illegal" and "questionable."</TE>
<TE>   The line separating the three is in the eye of the beholder. "Mr.
Davis," Hertz asked again, "does the upper signature appear stronger or
more vibrant than the lower one?"</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's all subjective," Davis replied, "but I would have
accepted this one."</TE>
<TE>   There is no cross-examination, but Bruce Gridley, the attorney for
Compton, weighs in occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the court commenting," he asked on Tuesday, "as to whether it
agrees there is a similarity in the 'Gs' and the 'Ls' in these
signatures?"</TE>
<TE>   The lack of theater had one courtroom observer's head lolling as he
nodded in and out of consciousness that morning, barely an hour into the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   But for the vigilant, unexpected details, some of them fascinating,
emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The signature of one Jose Ledesma rose at a sharp angle on one
document and was level on another.</TE>
<TE>   Davis pointed out a notation on the ballot indicating that Ledesma was
blind, and guessed that he had been assisted with the signature that was
level.</TE>
<TE>   One of Simon Goss' signatures appeared much smoother than the other.
Davis noted that the clean signature was made in 1978, when Goss was 36.</TE>
<TE>   "His signature has changed quite a bit, but that happens as you get
older," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, absentee ballots were examined. This week, the scrutiny has
turned to signatures on voting precinct rosters that were flagged as
questionable by the county registrar's office. The courtroom process,
orderly if not speedy, remains the same.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes on the fifth floor of downtown's Superior Court, a
battle for the mayoralty of a city of 93,000, fought letter by letter.</TE>
<TE>   "It may seem boring from an observer's point of view," said Gridley.
"But with something as essential as the right to vote, you have to do it
right."</TE>
<TE>   In five days of testimony, 80 votes have been declared illegal, 126
legal and 26 questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hundred more to go.</TE>

<HD>After-School Center Honors Slain Brothers</HD>
<DH>Community: Mayor Hahn and victims' mother take part in ceremony at
facility, which was named for the three men.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The opening ceremony Wednesday of a South-Central community center,
named in honor of three slain brothers, was bittersweet.</LD>
<LD>   As the mayor and others extolled the new Florence Brothers After
School Program, where children can come for free tutoring and recreation,
they offered condolences to Brenda Florence, the mother of the slain men.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt it was important to help their mother in the healing process
as well as redirect some of the negativity of what occurred," said Pastor
Frederick Murph of Brookins Community AME Church, which operates the
center.</LD>
<TE>   "These were three young men on their way up in life who were
tragically cut down in their youth, and we wanted to let their lives
speak to the community."</TE>
<TE>   The Florence brothers were killed within a week of each other last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Florence, 21, was shot by a sniper Sept. 28 as he drove on
10th Avenue in Inglewood. Two days later, his brothers, Torry, 29, and
Michael, 27, were shot half a mile from that site as they waited at a red
light by someone who pulled up next to them.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they believe that the older brothers had been driving
around looking for clues to Christopher's slaying. Though police suspect
the killers are gang members, they emphasize that the brothers were not.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers and their mother, who lived in Inglewood, had been
members of the church for several years, and Brenda Florence said it was
an honor to have the after-school program named for her sons.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids were raised with a very strong Christian foundation,"
Florence said.</TE>
<TE>   The community center, she said, will help parents trying to keep their
children safe.</TE>
<TE>   The federally funded center at 1900 W. 48th St. began operating in
December with about 25 children and has since grown to include 56. It
offers free after-school tutoring, computer instruction, Spanish classes,
arts and crafts, and recreation for children ages 8 to 17 from 2 p.m. to
6 p.m. It has five full-time employees and about 20 volunteers, Murph
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles, in the midst of all
you hear about violence and killing, we've got a program that's trying to
make a difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Mayor James K. Hahn thanked Brenda Florence for allowing the
renaming in her sons' honor, she held back tears as the audience gave her
a standing ovation.</TE>

<HD>DWP Chief to Receive $326,000 in Pay, Stipend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite complaints of excessive spending, the Los Angeles City
Council voted Wednesday to continue paying a $3,500 monthly housing
allowance to Department of Water and Power General Manager David H. Wiggs
Jr. in addition to his $284,000 annual salary.</LD>
<LD>   The $42,000 annual allowance, first offered when Wiggs relocated to
the area as an interim general manager in April, was continued by the
council even after it was told he already has a house here. Wiggs could
not be reached for confirmation.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Wiggs was found to be exceptionally well qualified," mayoral
chief of staff Tim McOsker told the council. "We thought it was
beneficial to the city and ratepayers to make the offer to Mr. Wiggs
carrying over the exact compensation he now receives."</LD>
<TE>   Councilmen Nate Holden and Eric Garcetti voted against the
compensation package, saying that it sends the wrong message to taxpayers
when the city is facing a housing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of principle," Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Holden complained that the salary is significantly more than what the
mayor is paid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is absolutely absurd," Holden said. "The taxpayers are being
ripped off by this deal."</TE>
<TE>   Chief legislative analyst Ron Deaton said the next highest-paid city
official is Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, who makes about $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs' salary is at the top of the salary range set for the general
manager's position, so providing the housing allowance allows more
compensation without going through the complex process of drafting a new
salary range.</TE>
<TE>   The council did agree to ask the city's Executive Employee Relations
Committee to review whether a higher salary range can be set for the
general manager in lieu of the housing allowance. To do that, the city
must conduct a survey of similar utility executive positions to justify
the amount.</TE>
<TE>   City Administrative Officer William Fujioka told the council that even
with compensation of $326,000 annually, Wiggs is receiving much less than
the compensation received by private utility executives.</TE>
<TE>   Holden said: "The difference is, they are bankrupt. They paid too much
at the top."</TE>

<HD>City Council Orders Count of Billboards</HD>
<DH>Advertising: Members want an inventory of outdoor signs and demand
an explanation for delays in moving against the illegal ones.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated with delays in tightening regulation of the billboard
industry, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday ordered an inventory
of outdoor advertisements as a first step toward cracking down on illegal
signs.</LD>
<LD>   Some council members voiced concern that the city attorney's office
has not completed regulations ordered last June. The council called on
City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and building officials to explain the delays
in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The action came hours after Delgadillo announced that he had filed 70
misdemeanor charges against two firms for posting small, illegal signs on
streets in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Billboard companies spent $425,000 on advertising that promoted
Delgadillo's campaign for city attorney last year, and since then he has
been trying to demonstrate his independence.</TE>
<TE>   That was the message he sought to convey Wednesday in announcing the
charges against House2Home and Siggy Signs. The signs, advertising a
going-out-of-business sale, were posted on city poles and property along
Sherman Way, Nordhoff Street, Mason Avenue and De Soto Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Delgadillo obtained a court order temporarily
blocking the construction of big billboards along area freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "My office will continue to be vigilant against those companies who
choose to disregard local laws and degrade our communities," Delgadillo
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The council in June directed the city attorney's office to draft an
ordinance that would require all billboards to display city permits. The
council also told building officials last year to take inventory of the
billboards by asking companies to voluntarily disclose their signs'
locations.</TE>
<TE>   "Six months ago, there was direction to do something and nothing has
been done to our knowledge," Councilman Dennis Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Austin, a spokesman for Delgadillo, said attorneys must coordinate
with other departments and consider complex state laws in drafting the
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a complicated process that involves not only the Planning
Department but also state environmental laws. But make no mistake about
it, we will have this completed before we testify before the council,"
Austin said. "We will come down on the side of neighborhoods, not on the
side of the billboard industry."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, council members reiterated their June requests and went
even further. Delgadillo was directed to draft an ordinance requiring a
mandatory, rather than voluntary, inventory of signs by the advertising
firms. The council continued to insist that billboards display city
permit information but directed the city attorney to explore the
possibility of using a bar-code system to allow for easy inspection.</TE>
<TE>   "With a complete list of signs, we will identify illegal billboards
and take swift steps to remove them," Councilman Jack Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Wendell of the Building and Safety Department said his office
lacks the manpower to provide the enforcement the council is seeking.
Officials estimate that the council will have to provide $3 million a
year for the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The council also asked its staff to draft a fee proposal to pay for
more inspectors to target illegal billboards.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that the billboard companies have been running a power
play against us," Weiss said. "With this measure, the city will no longer
be outgunned, out-muscled and outmaneuvered by the sign companies."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn said something should have been done sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," she said. "We ask for reports and, unless someone
happens to remember, these things are languishing all over the city of
Los Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Operator of Group Homes Wins Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury awards $500,000 to man after ruling that the county
improperly shut down his facilities for neglected children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury in Los Angeles has found that the county improperly shut
down a chain of group homes for neglected children, awarding the man who
ran it nearly $500,000 in damages.</LD>
<LD>   The county child welfare department did not allow Fred's Group Homes
to properly respond to embezzlement charges before removing the troubled
boys placed in its four facilities, the jury concluded Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Fred Baker said the decision was a vindication and opened
the door to others who had been shut down under similar circumstances.
County officials, however, said the decision was a narrow one that they
might appeal.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Children and Family Services stopped using Fred
Baker's facilities in South-Central Los Angeles, Compton and Lancaster in
1996 after its auditors determined that he embezzled $128,000 while
failing to provide the children enough food, clothing or counseling
services. The county paid $53,000 a year for each child.</TE>
<TE>   They contended that Baker and his wife used public money for
vacations, parking tickets and mortgage payments. The Bakers admitted
using the money for personal expenses, but consistently argued that the
amount was more than offset by loans Fred Baker had made to the company
and the salaries that he and his wife did not collect for about two years
when the operation suffered financial difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   But Fred Baker refused to submit to a review by the county
auditor-controller, and the county pulled out the children.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, who ran group homes for two decades, sued the county in federal
court in 1996, alleging civil rights violations because he was not
allowed to appeal his case to a disinterested party. The county would
allow him to appeal decisions only within the child welfare department
and to the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The county in turn sued Baker in state court, charging fraud, breach
of contract and theft. The cases were consolidated in state court and
went to trial in November.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the jury sided with Baker.</TE>
<TE>   It did not find fraud or civil rights violations. It decided that both
sides violated the contract, but that the county's due process violations
mitigated Baker's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors decided the county owes Baker $450,940, which his lawyers said
adds up roughly to the net income of Baker's nonprofit business in its
last year, multiplied by the three years left in its contract with the
county.</TE>
<TE>   County officials would not discuss the facts of the case Wednesday but
said they may appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very disappointed in the verdict and we are discussing all our
post-trial options," said Roger Granbo, principal deputy county counsel.</TE>
<TE>   So are Baker's lawyers, who had asked the jury for $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "They are left with nothing but a moral victory," said Santa Ana-based
lawyer William D. Chapman. "At least they feel that they have their good
name back and are vindicated."</TE>
<TE>   Baker will ask Superior Court Judge Helen Bendix to either allow a
retrial or amend the jury's verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "Their lives have been destroyed from this," Chapman said. "They were
humiliated and embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   After the homes were shut down, Baker moved in with relatives in North
Carolina and worked part time as a truck driver while his wife worked in
telemarketing and at a Kmart, his attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   The county's allegations that the children did not receive enough food
or clothing was based on statements to auditors by some of the children,
none of whom were ever identified or subsequently interviewed, Chapman
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Bakers had hoped the jury verdict would be enough to start
another nonprofit group home, but that the award will be swallowed up by
debts and other necessities.</TE>

<HD>Acquittal in Abuse Case Tied to Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Long Beach man, convicted in April of child abuse in connection
with the killing of a 3-year-old girl, was acquitted of assault charges
in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After three days of deliberations, jurors found Randy Lonell Foster,
24, not guilty of administering severe discipline on his girlfriend's
daughter, Milan Anjonet Scott, causing the girl's death in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Milan's body was cut into seven pieces, then hidden in concrete and
placed in the trunk of Foster's car, according to testimony.</LD>
<TE>   As the verdict was read, Foster cried and slumped in his chair. He
remains in custody because of the previous conviction. He was acquitted
of murder in April.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Michael E. Pastor set sentencing on the child abuse conviction
for Feb. 6. Foster faces a maximum of 10 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Foster is still very emotional and upset about the death of
Milan," said his lawyer, Public Defender Thomas Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Victor Rodriguez had argued that Foster
administered severe discipline on the girl, which led to her death.</TE>
<TE>   Foster and his girlfriend, Rakeisha Lanette Scott, 24, told police
that Milan went to bed dizzy one night after falling down in the
bathroom. When they woke the next morning, she was dead, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Out of fear of losing custody of the couple's infant son, Foster
panicked and hid Milan's body, Moore said during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The body was found by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies June 27,
2000, after Foster's father, William Foster, told police he had learned
from his son that Milan's body was in the trunk of a car in the backyard
of his Willowbrook home.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was convicted in April of murdering the girl. She was also found
guilty of assault on a child under age 8 and child endangerment. Scott
was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Her sentencing had been postponed pending her possible testimony in
Foster's retrial. But she decided not to testify, Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed with the verdict," Rodriguez said. "Even though it
was a difficult case, I still believe we had sufficient evidence to
obtain a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "There was evidence of conscience of guilt, the dismemberment, because
he certainly went through a lot of trouble to get rid of the body."</TE>

<HD>During Morning Rush Hour, Commuters Now Have to Watch Out for Bees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HARVEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sting alert for motorists: KNX radio's Donna Page reported that
traffic slowed on the San Diego Freeway on Wednesday morning when a
beehive was discovered hanging from an Irvine overpass. A brave firm
named Bee Busters whisked the hive away before the inhabitants lost their
tempers.</LD>
<LD>   Guide to adventurous dining: Today's selections (see accompanying)
include:</LD>
<LD>   * An "asorted" breakfast food, which, as Pat Langdon of Cypress says,
undoubtedly will have "animal rights activists up in arms."</LD>
<TE>   * Some hors d'oeuvres that seem to be made out of canvas (Harriet May
of Thousand Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   * Liquid refreshment sold in unusual quantities (Anthony D'Amico of
Hacienda Heights).</TE>
<TE>   * And a French car powered by alcohol (J. McWilliams).</TE>
<TE>   It's always better to settle disputes with words: The L.A.
Independent's police log reports that "two men were arguing at a gym over
a business dispute when the suspect hit the victim with a book."</TE>
<TE>   What's down: So lawyers for an entertainment company filed suit in
L.A. to shield the firm from being sued by Anheuser-Busch Inc. over use
of the phrase "Whassup?" on some T-shirts. The brewer has a trademark for
the phrase, which has been uttered (ad nauseum) in its commercials by
beer-guzzling types.</TE>
<TE>   My reaction: I'd almost pay to see a bunch of high-priced attorneys
engaged in a courtroom discussion that requires them to continually utter
"whassup" in serious tones.</TE>
<TE>   More imitation Orange: Steve Lustro of Pomona points out that the high
school scenes in the movie "Orange County" were shot at Diamond Ranch
High in Pomona (in L.A. County). And, I might add, Occidental College in
Eagle Rock stood in for Stanford, the school of choice for the young
writer in the movie. The school he dreads he'll have to attend is "Orange
County University." He never visits there, so we don't know what campus
might have been used to portray it. USC, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-car experiences: Remember the UCLA scandal involving the
football players who obtained handicapped parking placards at the school?
Well, Brian Lowe writes that while attending a UCLA-USC women's
basketball game, "we saw a Trojan fan's car, sporting USC flags and
covered with bumper stickers, receive a ticket on the UCLA campus--for
parking in a handicapped space." Theorized Lowe: "Maybe it's something in
the air?"</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, we think: Not long ago, someone donated a 1969 Cadillac hearse
to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in L.A. "I had to drive it around
into our parking lot," said Tony Terrazas, the society's thrift store
director. "I was a little leery getting inside. I'll be in one someday I
know, but not now."</TE>
<TE>   Society workers never know what folks are going to drop off there. The
thrift shop has sold such donated items as an antique Spanish gun ($600),
a 1979 Rolls-Royce ($20,000) and a 1936 Ford coupe ($2,600).</TE>
<TE>   The society is awaiting a buyer for "an original designer gown by Oleg
Cassini." It was worn to the inaugural ball at President Bill Clinton's
first inauguration. (No, I don't know the name of this female Clinton
admirer.)</TE>
<TE>miscelLAny:</TE>
<TE>   Cyber-commentator Jeff Schimmel notes that singer Wayne Newton was
selected for a commendation from the Pentagon for entertaining the troops
in Afghanistan. "Although the soldiers didn't really like his
performance," Schimmel said, "thousands of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters
surrendered when they heard his rendition of 'Danke Schoen.' "</TE>

<HD>Troubled Jewish Centers Get Chance to Stay Afloat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Jewish Community Centers, facing possible closure by their
financially strapped management group, were given the opportunity to
submit business plans that could carry them into the future.</LD>
<LD>   Board members of the Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles
initially feared they would be discussing the closure of centers in
Silver Lake, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills when they met
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Marty Jannol, president of the Jewish Community Centers, or JCC,
ordered leaders fighting to save the four centers to submit business
plans by Wednesday for final decisions by the JCC board in February.</LD>
<TE>   "We are establishing this expedited process to determine how we can
best restructure the agency with the full input of the local
communities," Jannol said. Although JCC officials are "not making any
promises at this time," they hope that some centers might be saved, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The centers have existed for more than 40 years and provide a range of
education programs. There are seven altogether; three appear safe from
closure.</TE>
<TE>   The JCC discovered in October that it faced a $2.8-million deficit in
its $16-million operating budget.</TE>
<TE>   Some representatives of the four centers have already begun compiling
data for budget plans covering the 2002-2003 school year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we are going to find that we are not off the mark" of
presenting a budget that avoids going into the red, said Janie Schulman,
a member of the Silver Lake center who represented the site before board
members.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman said parents of children enrolled in programs at the four
centers were estimating "things like insurance costs, maintenance costs
and teaching costs."</TE>
<TE>   But drafting such plans is difficult, she said, because the JCC has
not provided the four centers with financial data, which would help in
making estimates for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Isaacson, whose children attend preschool at the Silver Lake
facility, said, "It is frustrating because our center needs to start
enrolling kids for next year."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she is encouraged that the four centers have a chance to submit
plans that could keep them afloat.</TE>

<HD>Officers Wound Burglary Suspect</HD>

<LD>A Los Angeles police officer responding to a burglar alarm at a
Canoga Park tobacco shop early Wednesday shot and wounded a man who
jumped the officer's partner and tried to grab his gun, an LAPD spokesman
said.</LD>
<LD>   A 22-year-old man, whom police would not identify, was hospitalized in
critical condition after the incident, reported about 4:30 a.m. in the
22000 block of Sherman Way, police spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said.</LD>
<LD>   The west San Fernando Valley patrol officers involved in the incident
were identified as seven-year veteran Raphael Ferrer, 33, and 24-year-old
rookie Officer Ryan Kennedy, Frank said.</LD>
<TE>   According to Frank, the officers found the back door broken open and
were searching the shop when the suspect jumped from behind a counter,
fought with Kennedy and grabbed for the officer's pistol, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that he and his partner were in danger, Ferrer fired twice,
striking the suspect in the torso, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives from the LAPD Critical Incident Investigation Division are
reviewing the shooting, Frank said. A Los Angeles district attorney's
team also responded, he said.</TE>

<HD>Death of Mall Project Ensured</HD>
<DH>Westwood: Council vote prevents building of $100-million complex on
Glendon Avenue.</DH>

<LD>City Councilman Jack Weiss nailed the coffin shut Wednesday on a
controversial mall construction plan in Westwood Village. Although the
project had been dead for two years, Weiss said he wanted to make sure
that it would not be resurrected.</LD>
<LD>   A unanimous council approved Weiss' measure to revoke the rights to
build Village Center Westwood, a $100-million movie theater and shopping
mall on Glendon Avenue originally proposed by developer Ira Smedra in
1996.</LD>
<LD>   Smedra abandoned the plan in 2000 when he sold his interest in the
project to Casden Properties Inc., which plans to build apartments and a
supermarket on the property.</LD>
<TE>   But because the rights to the mega-mall still existed, Weiss said,
"There's no telling what could happen with future owners. I wanted to
make certain that this [project] wouldn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Village Center bitterly fought the proposal, even posting
lawn signs that urged their councilman to oppose the project. Village
Center would have destroyed Glendon Manor, one of Westwood's original
1929 apartment buildings, shut down part of Glendon Avenue and erected a
110-foot tower that went against the city's land-use ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be in keeping with the village characteristics of
Westwood," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Lake, founder of Friends of Westwood, on Wednesday morning urged
the council to effectively kill the project. "It was a nuisance to us,"
she said. "We defeated it a couple of years ago, and this just makes it
official."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Casden, president of Casden Properties, said his plan for the
site is completely different from Smedra's and not as troublesome. Casden
said his development, called Palazzo Westwood, would be half the height
of Village Center and wouldn't require any street closures.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to meet with the members of the community and the City
Council office in order to bring our proposal to fruition," Casden said.
"The previous applicant, Ira Smedra, has no ownership interest . . . in
the new project."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, elected in November, said his measure kept a campaign promise.
"I pledged . . . that I would oppose this particular project," he said.
"I'm proud that I was able to kill it within the first year."</TE>

<HD>Teens Killed in Crash Memorialized</HD>
<DH>Service: Saugus High School students remember their friends Sheldon
Bell and Robert Smith, who died Sunday in a car wreck.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a memorial service Wednesday at Saugus High School, friends of
two student athletes killed in a car accident this week honored their
memories and sounded a warning to their classmates about reckless
driving.</LD>
<LD>   An hour after taking their semester final exams, more than 1,000
students gathered in the gym, many wearing Mardi Gras beads like the ones
Sheldon Bell and Robert Smith favored, others in bright red T-shirts that
Robert liked.</LD>
<LD>   Robert and Sheldon, both 17-year-old seniors, died Sunday in a car
accident while reportedly speeding on Bouquet Canyon Road in Saugus.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Robert lost control of his Ford Mustang, which jumped
the median and spun before ramming the backyard retaining wall of a
house. Sheldon died at the scene; Robert died later at a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   To counter a report by authorities that Robert did not have a
California driver's license, friends brought copies of his license to the
memorial service.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the students who spoke at the hourlong service--which also
memorialized freshman Daniel Lieberman, killed in a motorcycle accident
Jan. 1--honored their friends with poems or anecdotes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never forget the bright smiles he had on his face," Ryan Dabis,
18, said of Sheldon, his best friend of 12 years. "He always pushed
people to do their best."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Dietz, 17, remembered Robert as a loyal friend.</TE>
<TE>   "When they pulled the sheet back, I saw my best friend there,
lifeless," said Patrick, who identified Robert's body at the hospital. "I
dropped to my knees and asked why this had to happen. I hugged him and
kissed him on the forehead and wished that he could give me one more
hug."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon McCullough, 17, said Robert insisted on going bowling every
weekend but never really learned the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time he'd throw the ball, it would fly up in the air first,
then it would only hit maybe one pin," Brandon said. "He was always my
partner. We never won."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan said his classmates' deaths should serve as a warning.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks they're invincible and nothing will happen to them,"
he said. "That's what Robert and Sheldon thought. It happened to them."</TE>

<HD>O.C. to Pay Tollway Company for Right to Improve Freeway</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Transportation authority agrees to give $4 million to
owners of the 91 Express Lanes to compensate for potential loss of
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority on Wednesday agreed to
pay $4 million in public funds to a private tollway company to remove a
key bottleneck on the heavily traveled Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest attempt to relieve congestion on the freeway, the
authority's board members unanimously approved a $12-million widening for
a short stretch of the westbound lanes just east of Coal Canyon Road.</LD>
<LD>   To get the project off the ground, the authority will pay $4 million
to the owners of the controversial 91 Express Lanes, a privately owned
tollway that runs down the middle of the freeway. The lane owners have
veto power over improvements to the public portions of the highway.</LD>
<TE>   Under a franchise agreement with the state, owners of the 10-mile
turnpike from north Anaheim to the Riverside County line can block
freeway widenings or new road construction if those improvements threaten
to take away toll lane customers.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County is now suing to end that agreement, and some critics
of the Express Lanes say the restrictions have been a stumbling block to
improvements along one of the most congested highways in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "We are no longer willing to sit on the sidelines while traffic
continues to get worse," said Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who
chairs the transportation authority's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists make 250,000 to 270,000 trips a day on the Riverside Freeway
through Santa Ana Canyon--most of them commuters headed from Riverside
and San Bernardino counties to jobs in Orange and Los Angeles counties.
If trends continue, more than 400,000 car trips a day will be made
through the corridor by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   The authority and tollway officials described the $4-million payment
as a fair compromise that will compensate the Express Lanes for a
potential loss of business while allowing improvements to the Riverside
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30,000 trips a day are made on the Express Lanes. Company
officials say a dip in ridership is possible if a new public lane is
added and freeway travel times are improved.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy we could work with Caltrans and OCTA to bring an
improvement to the 91 earlier than would have happened otherwise," said
Greg Hulsizer, general manager of the Express Lanes. "This is what
happens when you cooperate rather than litigate."</TE>
<TE>   The project will add a sixth lane along 1,000 yards of westbound
freeway just east of Coal Canyon Road. Restriping will take place in the
next couple of months to add a temporary lane until the project is
finished in January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The area is now a bottleneck because the highway narrows from six
lanes to five for a short distance after entering Orange County. Traffic
slows dramatically as motorists in the free stretch of carpool lanes
merge to the right to avoid the toll lanes. At the same time, vehicles in
the right lanes are merging to the left.</TE>
<TE>   "That lane drop has been a big problem for commuters," said Corona
City Councilman Jeff Miller, who uses the Riverside Freeway to get to
work in Orange County. "Small projects like this can make a huge
difference."</TE>
<TE>   The California Department of Transportation will provide $7.9 million
for the project. Under the agreement with the tollway, Orange County
buses also will be able to use the Express Lanes without paying the toll.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation authority officials say the lane project will be
completed at least two years earlier than contemplated under a court
settlement reached a few years ago after the Express Lanes sued Caltrans
to halt a widening project. The settlement provided for a sixth lane in
the project area by 2006 at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Some Riverside County officials have criticized the lane addition,
saying government funds should not be paid to a private company to make a
public highway safer and less congested. The county's pending lawsuit
against the tollway and Caltrans alleges that the franchise agreement is
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Bob Buster said the project allows California Private
Transportation Co., the owners of the 91 Express Lanes, to exploit the
franchise agreement to increase revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Others such as Supervisor Tom Mullen welcomed the transportation
authority's project, saying that people on his side of the county line
"should be appreciative of the fact that Orange County is trying to solve
the same problems they are dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   Authority officials said Wednesday that the payment to the Express
Lanes should be repaid if the authority proceeds with a proposal to buy
out the entire tollway. Negotiations for a sale are scheduled to begin
later this month or in February.</TE>
<TE>   The authority decided to take action on the lane addition after a bill
to expedite the project stalled in the Legislature. The measure by
Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher (R-Brea) would have authorized the use of
state funds to compensate California Private Transportation for any loss
of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "What OCTA did is exactly what would have happened under my bill,"
Daucher said. "This gives people hope that we will start resolving
long-standing congestion issues on the 91."</TE>

<HD>Contaminated Soil at El Toro Is Cited in Anti-Park Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developing a park at the El Toro Marine base is too risky because
it would expose people to cancer-causing chemicals in the soil, the
chairman of an environmental review board told supervisors Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental attorney Greg Hurley repeated controversial warnings he
issued last month that contamination from 56 years of military use hasn't
yet and may never be cleaned at El Toro. It would be too great a safety
risk to build a park with a large lake and gardens at the former base, he
said.</LD>
<LD>   Voters on March 5 will be asked to replace the county's plan for an
airport with plans for a park, nature preserve and other development on
the 4,700-acre site.</LD>
<TE>   Supervisors, who have promoted the airport for seven years by a
one-vote margin, split 2-2 over whether to accept Hurley's report.
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who backs an airport at the base, left before
his presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson, who oppose the airport plan,
said they couldn't endorse Hurley's conclusions because they focused
solely on the park. Any report acknowledged by the county should come
from its own consultants and should evaluate both El Toro plans, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer sparred the most with Hurley, asking him to justify his
conclusions. At one point, Spitzer apologized for heavy criticism aimed
at Hurley, who has headed the El Toro environmental review board for five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Spitzer said, is that Hurley's analysis of El Toro was
presented at a luncheon sponsored by two pro-airport groups. Hurley was
paid by the groups to analyze the environmental issues surrounding the
park plan.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley said concerns about excavating base soil would exist with the
airport as well as the park. The difference, he said, is that airport
runways would cover contaminated soil and the airport's limited access
would discourage human contact, while a park would do the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Given the level of possible contamination, "Do we know enough to make
a decision on whether or not to accept the base" from the Navy? Spitzer
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we know enough to start development of the base," said
Hurley, a partner at Kutak Rock, one of the country's leading
environmental law firms.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley has argued that the Navy's cleanup plan for El Toro focused on
written records of contamination at the base, listed as one of the most
polluted sites in the country. Much of the contamination wasn't
documented, he said. And without knowing for sure whether the soil was
clean, the county likely will encounter problems after the base is handed
over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials have said they based their review on decades of records
and were not required to test the soil. If the county wants to do soil
testing, that could be arranged, they said, as long as the county has a
safety plan and accepts the liability.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires the Navy to clean up contamination at the base.
But there is no deadline for cleanup, which could take decades. The Navy
also could decide that some areas cannot be fully cleaned and place them
off-limits for redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy is expected to approve its final cleanup plan in April, as a
prelude to conveying the property to the county's control.</TE>
<TE>   An independent study of El Toro released by Irvine in January 2000
came to a similar conclusion as Hurley: that exposure to soil excavated
during construction at the base presented a higher than acceptable cancer
risk. People could be exposed to harmful levels of hazardous materials
without even knowing it, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Brown, an environmental consultant for Irvine, told
supervisors that Hurley was overstating the Irvine report. Irvine
officials also have criticized Hurley's conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley said his reputation has been maligned by such attacks.</TE>

<LD>A 3,000-gallon sewage spill closed Little Corona Beach on
Wednesday--the second time this year that a stretch of Orange County's
coastline has been tainted by raw human waste, according to the county
Health Care Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The sewage spilled from a new Irvine Ranch Water District pipeline
about three miles inland in Newport Coast. Sand in the line caused the
spill, which flowed down Buck Gully and into the ocean, according to the
agency.</LD>
<LD>   The ocean at Little Corona will remain off-limits until water testing
shows that it's safe.</LD>

<HD>Torch Is Carried On</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Thousands show up to encourage the 46 who ran with the
flame in Oxnard and Ventura.</DH>

<LD>Taking a break from jobs and school, thousands of jubilant Ventura
County residents witnessed history on the hoof Wednesday as torchbearers
holding aloft the Olympic flame wended their way through wildly cheering,
flag-waving crowds.</LD>
<LD>   Lighted in Olympia, Greece, in November, the flame was flown to
Atlanta, the site of the most recent Olympic Games in the United States.
It has been transported to places as large as Los Angeles and as small as
Hickory, N.C., with about 12,000 torchbearers each carrying the symbol of
global harmony for two-tenths of a mile, about the length of 3 1/2
football fields.</LD>
<LD>   Eager for the spectacle on Wednesday, Anne Viera hauled her three
daughters in a stroller and a baby carrier to Ventura's Main Street,
where Ventura High School cheerleaders performed routines beneath an
immense archway of balloons in their school's colors of black and gold.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like the fair parade," Viera explained to 7-year-old Allison.
"Only now, it's the whole world getting together."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of students drifted in and out of a rally at the high school,
listening to music and playing hockey with broomsticks. Down the street,
Ojai postal worker Reba Seba darted onto the sidewalk from beneath a hair
dryer at the Self Image beauty salon.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could sneak out here without being noticed," said Seba,
wearing foil coverings in her hair and a black smock. "I just didn't want
to miss out on anything."</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard, the caldron bearing the Olympic flame arrived by truck from
Pasadena an hour past schedule. It will follow a dipsy-doodle course to
the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, proceeding up the coast to Washington
and being flown to Alaska before finally arriving at the opening ceremony
Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   At the flame's Ventura County launch point, a Chevrolet dealership off
Oxnard Boulevard, a mariachi band pumped up the crowd and street vendors
hawked everything from U.S. flags to plastic Olympic medals.</TE>
<TE>   As the convoy and its police escorts drew near, 19-year-old David
Rodela made his way to the starting line and became an instant celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard resident, a lightweight boxer who aspires to compete in the
2004 Olympics, was chosen to kick off the county's link in the nationwide
relay. A crowd hungry for photos and autographs mobbed him. When he
lighted his torch, the crowd urged him along with a spontaneous chant:
"USA! USA! USA!"</TE>
<TE>   True to his word, Rodela walked his segment of the relay, savoring
every step.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to enjoy a great moment," he said afterward, dressed in
his white Olympic sweatsuit and holding onto the silver torch cylinder,
its flame now extinguished. "This is going to be a day I remember until
they put me in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The 46 torchbearers in Oxnard and Ventura were chosen in different
ways. Shauna Peters, a 20-year-old university student from London,
Ontario, won a drawing sponsored by a Canadian restaurant chain. Peters
loped past Ventura High, assigned that segment arbitrarily by the relay's
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Others were nominated by their friends and families because they had
acted selflessly or overcome staggering adversities.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, Terry White was cheered on by her family as she rounded a
downtown corner. The 39-year-old Palmdale woman summed up her jog with a
breathless "Wonderful!"--a simple description that is especially
meaningful for a woman who has endured seven brain surgeries in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Running up the steps at City Hall, Nadine Parsons of Fort Worth beamed
as she used her torch to light the one carried by her mother, Sharon
Troll. A breast cancer survivor, Troll works for the Boys &amp; Girls Club of
Ventura on programs to keep youths out of gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Before her run, Troll picked a spot on her mantel for the torch she
would use. Participants could buy their torches for $335.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just awed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The day's carnival atmosphere was punctuated with poignant
observations. For many, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks weren't far from
mind.</TE>
<TE>   In green hospital scrubs, Don Lake, an intensive-care nurse at Ventura
County Medical Center, recognized the day's bittersweet undertone as he
stood on a sidewalk in Ventura, waiting for the procession to come
through.</TE>
<TE>   "With all that's going on in the world, this is pretty special right
now," he said. "I'm behind anything that brings the country together a
little more."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the day's novelty couldn't be denied.</TE>
<TE>   "In Ventura you'll see just about anything," joked Leslie Garrett, a
waitress at the Vagabond coffee shop downtown. "Someone running down the
street with something that's on fire--not unusual. But the Olympic torch:
Now, that's really a big deal!"</TE>

<HD>Stan Herman, 67; Real Estate Broker Created a Home for Backgammon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stan Herman, a Westside real estate broker who with Hugh Hefner
founded the Pips Club, featuring their favorite board game, backgammon,
has died. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Herman, who established Stan Herman &amp; Associates in Beverly Hills 43
years ago, died Saturday of leukemia in his suburban Santa Barbara home.</LD>
<LD>   He became a fan of backgammon in the early 1970s and started the Stan
Herman Invitational Backgammon Tournament, staged annually at the
original Bistro Restaurant in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   After meeting over a friendly game, Herman and Hefner in 1973 created
the Pips discotheque and backgammon club.</TE>
<TE>   Its name is the term for the 24 points on a backgammon board.</TE>
<TE>   The private Westside club charged annual dues of as much as $1,000,
plus $20 or so in monthly fees, and featured a dining room, a disco and a
backgammon room with custom-made tables and mirrored walls.</TE>
<TE>   Established at the height of the local craze for backgammon-a game
made popular in Monte Carlo in the late 1960s-Pips was operated as a
nonprofit club, giving any profits to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Herman was born in Los Angeles and served in the Army during the
Korean War. He worked as a lifeguard at a Las Vegas swimming pool and
sold used cars before settling into the real estate business in the
mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>   He soon was driving a Rolls-Royce and weekending at his beach house in
Malibu. He specialized in expensive homes and bought and sold them for
foreign royalty, entertainment executives and stars, and businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   'With inflation rates worldwide running from a low 10% a year to 300%
or more in countries like Argentina, it doesn't make any sense to bury
the money in a Swiss bank," Herman told The Times in 1976, explaining why
Southern California real estate was so attractive to foreign buyers.
"This is the safest country in the world for their money.'</TE>
<TE>   Among the properties he handled was the former ICM headquarters
building at 8899 Beverly Blvd., which he and Pierre Cossette acquired for
$5 million in 1981. It is now valued at $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   Herman is survived by his wife, Sheila, son Ryan and daughter Sabrina.</TE>
<TE>   Private services are planned. The family has asked that memorial
donations be sent to the attention of Dr. F. Kass at the Cancer
Foundation of Santa Barbara, 300 W. Pueblo St., Santa Barbara, CA

<HD>Sept. 11 Fund's Fine Print Angers Many Relatives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>When a federal fund to compensate relatives of the Sept. 11 dead
was announced shortly before Christmas, the average award size--$1.6
million--seemed generous enough to take care of the people left behind.</LD>
<LD>   But now that they've read the fine print and done the math, many
families--and the lawyers, financial advisors and politicians who serve
them--are considerably less satisfied.</LD>
<LD>   They say the fund is stingy, it penalizes people who have other death
benefits and lawyers say it makes it impractical for them to sue.</LD>
<TE>   This week, they are making a desperate last pitch to modify the
federal Victims' Compensation Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Feinberg, the special master appointed by the U.S. attorney
general to oversee the compensation program, has until Tuesday to hear
comments about the rules he established to dispense the money. Then, he
will draw up a final set of guidelines and start accepting claims.</TE>
<TE>   But the complexities of the program and limitations created by
Congress are likely to continue to stoke dissatisfaction. Only 107 people
have filed claims for emergency money from the federal fund. Many
families, overwhelmed by sorrow, are now also angry over the fund.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a last hurrah for us to urge reform," said Michael Cartier of
Give Your Voice, a group of about 400 victims' families agitating for
change. "But I'm not sure this will end here. I suspect people will keep
fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, about 1,000 relatives of the dead are expected to rally on
Manhattan's East Side to complain about the rules. Earlier this week, a
Boston-based group held a news conference demanding changes. Interested
parties ranging from the trial lawyers' association to congressional
delegations are filing their objections.</TE>
<TE>   All this is being done for an audience of one--special master
Feinberg, a Georgetown University Law Center professor. Since he was
appointed Nov. 26, he has held back-to-back meetings with families, first
to get their advice and, since Christmas, to sell them on his proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent of the law and the special master," said his spokesman
Charles Miller, "is to make the families financially whole. But it's a
complicated program and people need to take the time to determine if it's
right for them."</TE>
<TE>   Among the points of contention:</TE>
<TE>   * The $250,000 payment for the pain and suffering of the victim and
$50,000 to each dependent child. "Is the lack of a father for the next 20
years only worth $50,000?" asked John Lynch, a spokesman for the 9-11
Widows and Victims' Assn. "I don't think any parent would accept that
price tag."</TE>
<TE>   * The regulations seem to set a ceiling of $231,000 a year in economic
losses when some of the victims were making far more than that. And while
there seems to be a maximum, the regulations do not provide for a minimum
award.</TE>
<TE>   * Families complain that the formulas Feinberg is using to calculate
economic loss are skewed to help the low- and middle-class workers and
put high-end earners at a disadvantage. They add that these formulas
should not be based on national averages but rather on trends in the New
York area, where most of the dead lived and where the cost of living is
high.</TE>
<TE>   But what most angers some families--particularly of rescue workers and
financial services people who died in New York on Sept. 11--is that they
would get next to nothing in federal money because life insurance,
pensions and other death benefits must be deducted from any award.
However, those deductions were not taken into account when Feinberg
announced that the average award was $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   These same families also have no motivation to sue the airlines
because of caps Congress put on their liability.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the widows are facing a Catch 22 as they try to decide what
to do," Lynch said. "Their husbands' pensions are good enough so they get
nothing from the fund. [And] there's no point in filing a lawsuit because
Congress protected the airlines."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, 66, whose firefighter son Michael's body is still missing, said
he and his wife would never file a lawsuit because they did not want to
endure years of depositions and court appearances. They simply want to
find Michael's remains, Lynch said, "and move on."</TE>
<TE>   Regulations established by Feinberg grew out of a law enacted by
Congress 11 days after the terrorist attacks. The estimates then were
that as many as 9,000 people were dead, and Congress was concerned that
insurance claims against the airlines from so much death and destruction
would force them into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   So, the law was written in such a way that people who collect
compensation from the federal fund would give up their right to sue.
Altogether, Congress set aside $15 billion to bail out the industry and
estimated it would pay another $6 billion from the U.S. Treasury to take
care of families for their losses.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) said once it turned out that there were
not as many dead, Feinberg should not have created such restrictive
guidelines for the fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people get the title of special master," said King. "It's
time for him to buck up and stand up."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is Congress' law that is at the root of what is making
families feel trapped: They lose their right to sue if they take the
money, but if they do sue, the law limits the airlines' liability to the
limits of their insurance coverage--around $1.5 billion per plane.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that might cover payouts to relatives of the 233 people
who died in crashes in Pennsylvania and the Pentagon. But in New York,
there are 2,889 dead and an estimated $20 billion in property damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who sues, especially in New York, the best that they can hope
for after years and years of litigation is pennies on the dollar," said
Larry Stewart, a Miami attorney who heads Trial Lawyers Care, a nonprofit
group offering free legal advice to Sept. 11 families.</TE>
<TE>   But Mary Schiavo, a Los Angeles attorney and a former federal
transportation official, disagrees. She represents families of six
passengers on the fatal flights who filed suits last week against the
airlines and airport security companies, claiming they failed to protect
passengers from the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't buy the notion that there is a limit on what the airlines can
pay out," she said, contending that putting limits on the airlines'
liability is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   It is unacceptable "to my clients . . . that the negligent basically
escape unpunished," she added. "That is so against the whole American
system of jurisprudence."</TE>
<TE>   But while Stewart agrees airlines should be held accountable, he says
attorneys need to be most concerned about their clients' finances.</TE>
<TE>   In two years, Stewart predicts that the vast majority of people will
have filed with the fund "either because they want to get it over with or
they don't feel they have any choice."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's group has taken 1,000 calls from people who either need free
help going through the claims process or are considering suing.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kreindler, a New York attorney who has about 100 clients affected
by Sept. 11 deaths, says that if Feinberg does not change the way the
economic loss is computed, there might be more lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't take an average income of the last three years of a young
man and grow it by 4% a year to figure out a lifetime's earning when in
reality the guy has had a 50% growth rate per year," Kreindler said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping the regs will be improved," he added. "But, no matter how
much they are improved, what we're really hoping is that Feinberg uses
his discretionary power to help people. If he gives people 90% of the
full value on a claim, it's probably not worth suing. If he awards only
10%, that's another story."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who is dissatisfied with what Feinberg awards them will have
the right to a hearing, and the Justice Department is now opening seven
offices on the East Coast to guide people through the process.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cartier, whose father and brother met Tuesday with Feinberg to
explain their concerns, said they could not help coming away from the
meeting feeling a little sorry for the special master and the task he
faces ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a tough job and he shouldn't be trying to play Solomon,"
Cartier said. "Then again, he has to. The fact is the families did not
ask for this fund. It's supposed to make up for the rights that Congress
took away from us, our right to sue. And it should at least be fair."</TE>

<HD>IRS Plans Intensive Auditing</HD>
<DH>Taxes: Compliance program will examine 49,000 taxpayers to ferret
out cheating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service, worried that tax cheating is on the
rise, wants to bring back a version of the "super audits" that were so
dreaded and controversial that they were all but eliminated by the
agency.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS said Wednesday that it plans to audit 49,000 taxpayers
selected at random under its revamped taxpayer compliance program--dubbed
the National Research Program--beginning this fall.</LD>
<LD>   However, the agency said the program will not be as wide-ranging as
its proposed 1995 plan to subject 153,000 Americans to detailed,
line-by-line audits.</LD>
<TE>   Only 2,000 taxpayers will be targeted for line-by-line audits, the IRS
said. About 47,000 returns examined under the proposed project will be
checked by a combination of computerized data matching, taxpayer
correspondence and more directed audits that focus on only a few select
issues, the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   "The process is substantially less intrusive on taxpayers, but it will
help us catch tax cheating and improve tax administration," said IRS
Commissioner Charles Rossotti. "We have found new ways to use existing
information to measure tax compliance."</TE>
<TE>   IRS critics were quick to denounce the new audit program.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is insidious," said Robert Schriebman, a tax attorney in
Rolling Hills Estates who was a key witness in the IRS oversight hearings
in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very frightening. It's not the 2,000 potential audits. It's
'Where does it stop?' People might think, 'There are millions of tax
returns, who cares about 2,000?' But what is it going to be next year?"</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said detailed tax exams are
necessary to ferret out tax cheating. The old super audit program, known
as the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program, was widely feared by
taxpayers. But those audits resulted in a wealth of data that helped the
IRS pinpoint where audits were needed.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the old compliance audit program revealed that taxpayers
were frequently claiming tax deductions for nonexistent dependents. The
IRS subsequently decided in the late 1980s to ask taxpayers to include a
Social Security number for each child claimed as a dependent. The next
year, the number of dependents claimed dropped by 7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The last taxpayer compliance audits were conducted in 1988 and the
data used to target tax returns for "routine" audits are hopelessly out
of date, government officials said. As a result, the IRS is increasingly
auditing taxpayers who have done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "The IRS is simply auditing too many of the law-abiders and not enough
of the people who avoid paying taxes because [the agency] lacks the basic
information to make informed audit decisions," O'Neill said in a prepared
statement. "That only hurts the honest taxpayers and helps the cheats,
and that's backward."</TE>
<TE>   The IRS estimates that the new compliance audit program will eliminate
about 15,000 so-called no change audits annually. Those are cases in
which the IRS audits returns only to find that the taxpayer meticulously
obeyed the law.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also hope the program will slow the growth of tax cheating.
The IRS estimates that the tax gap--which includes the amount owed by
non-filers and those who under-report income--soared to $278 billion in
1998. A 0.1% improvement in compliance would generate $1 billion in tax
revenue, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS is seeking input on the new compliance program from Congress
and tax preparer groups, IRS spokesman Terry Lemons said. If the response
is favorable, the program could launch in October.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS brewed up a storm of controversy on Capitol Hill in the
mid-1990s when it last tried to launch a round of intensive compliance
audits. Congressional leaders compared the program with the Inquisition
and the IRS later dropped the idea, citing budget cutbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Finance
Committee and former member of a commission that restructured the IRS in
1998, said Wednesday that the agency needs to be mindful of taxpayer
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll monitor the IRS' implementation of this program closely to
ensure that the agency strikes the proper balance between taxpayers'
rights and its informational needs," the senator told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new compliance proposal, 8,000 returns would be checked
solely through computerized matching programs, requiring no contact with
the taxpayer. An additional 9,000 would involve the exchange of
correspondence between the IRS and the taxpayer, the agency said. About
30,000 would involve sit-down meetings with auditors, but would not
feature line-by-line scrutiny or require voluminous documentation.</TE>
<TE>   Only 2,000 of the compliance audits would be so-called calibration
audits requiring the selected taxpayers to document each line of each
return, the agency said. Even in those cases, the agency plans to require
less documentation, Lemons said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking a more common-sense approach," he said. "We aren't
going to require that you come up with the receipt for the $20 in postage
that you claimed as business expenses. We see these as being much more
comparable to a regular audit."</TE>
<TE>   Tax preparers say that change is pivotal because the old tax
compliance audits were so onerous that they were often referred to as
"audits from hell."</TE>
<TE>   Preparers also hated the old audits because the randomly selected
taxpayers often had done nothing suspicious--they were simply unlucky.
But they still had to endure examinations that took twice as much time as
an ordinary audit and often cost thousands of dollars when taxpayers had
to hire accountants to represent them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you claimed a dependent, we would require you to show their birth
certificate," said Gary Iskowitz, a Century City certified public
accountant who previously ran the IRS' audit division in Baltimore. "It
was a nightmare if you were selected."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron Employees Suggest Anderson Helped Veil Deals</HD>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The conference room on the 48th floor of Enron Corp.'s Houston
headquarters--the nerve center of the energy trader's convoluted and
risky deals--was at the opposite end of the hall from the company's
outside accounting firm, Andersen.</LD>
<LD>   The room was entirely paneled in whiteboards and furnished with a full
supply of colored markers. There Enron executives were briefed on the
dizzyingly complex structures that Andersen consultants had layered onto
deals that often had started out as straightforward. The experience often
left some at Enron dumbfounded.</LD>
<LD>   "You'd see things involving 30 or 40 different entities," said Clayton
Vernon, a former research analyst and trading manager at Enron. "They
would clear a whiteboard and draw a flowchart that would be absolutely
incomprehensible."</LD>
<TE>   Another former executive familiar with the conference room recalled:
"They'd be drawing boxes and arrows going in every direction." The
drawings would describe shell companies and offshore entities with
intricate interrelationships, all headed by mysterious figures designated
on the whiteboards as "Mr. X" or "Mr. Y."</TE>
<TE>   When pressed, accountants would identify the mystery figures only as
"somebody who's a friend of the company," according to the former
executive, who asked to remain unidentified. These phantom executives,
the Andersen accountants announced, were due payments of hundreds of
thousands of dollars to play their shadowy roles in the transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Andersen served Enron not only as its outside auditing
firm, bound to ensure that the company's books complied with financial
disclosure standards, but also as business consultants. The dual
function, which may have subjected Andersen to a conflict of interest, is
expected to come under intense scrutiny by Congress as it begins looking
into the Enron collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, the goal of the complex structures, the former
employees say, was twofold: to keep them off Enron's corporate balance
sheet and thus out of view of the public, and to enable Enron to record
revenue from the deals before it was received--often more revenue than
the deals were likely to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the rationale, this process is behind the extraordinary
complexity of Enron's financial dealings and helps explain how profound
problems in its numerous businesses eluded the comprehension of auditors,
shareholders, regulators and tax authorities for years.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's 2001 annual report lists about 3,800 subsidiaries, of which
more than 700 are located in the Cayman Islands or other offshore
financial havens. Most of these are known as "special purpose entities,"
or SPEs, created by Enron as vehicles for its complicated transactions.</TE>
<TE>   These deals were among those lambasted by Enron Vice President Sherron
S. Watkins, who complained in a memo she wrote Aug. 15 to Enron Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay. The memo was released earlier this week by a
congressional committee.</TE>
<TE>   Public documents and interviews with former Enron employees suggest
that during the last two years the company's deals became more
complicated and their economic rationales more suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The effect was to create transactions that, rather than benefiting
Enron, tended largely to enrich senior executives who were entitled to
special compensation for their roles in the partnerships. Andrew S.
Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, reportedly was entitled
to $30 million in such compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The aim also may have been to produce the illusion of continued
revenue gains for the company, which was facing slowing growth in many of
its core businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Even before that, the labyrinthine character of Enron deals was a
byword at the company. In early 2000, four months after he joined the
company, Vernon said he first saw deals that didn't seem quite right.</TE>
<TE>   "But the transactions were so complicated I assumed there was some
part I was missing that meant they were at least reasonable business
propositions for the Enron shareholders," he said. "In hindsight, they
should have raised more red flags."</TE>
<TE>   Vernon and others say there were indications within Enron that
high-level executives of the company's outside auditing firm, formerly
known as Arthur Andersen, approved of these maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, which on Tuesday fired the Houston-based partner overseeing
the Enron account and suggested that lax oversight of the company was
limited to its Houston office, declined to reply to questions Wednesday
about the firm's involvement in structuring the transactions. An Andersen
spokesman said the firm is looking into its actions and is cooperating
with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Vernon said he asked Enron Chairman Lay point-blank at a company "town
hall" session Sept. 26 if he was comfortable with Andersen's integrity
and oversight. At the time, the company was facing the first wave of
criticism over the offshore partnerships that had shielded liabilities
from public scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Lay replied in the affirmative, Vernon recalled, adding that not only
Andersen's Houston office but its national office had also approved the
partnerships in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is done ethically," Lay said, in Vernon's recollection.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokesman said Wednesday night that she could not confirm or
deny that Lay made the remarks Vernon attributed to him. Recordings of
this and other internal company meetings purportedly featuring Lay's
reassurances have been requested from Enron by congressional
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the complex structures enabled Enron to conceal the real
ramifications to its bottom line of many of its deals with offshore
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the sour deals stemmed from the company's ill-fated venture
into broadband communications in the late 1990s, when Wall Street was
highly excited about high-speed data services for homes and offices over
fiber-optic networks. Enron invested in several fiber-optic companies and
bought transmission rights over regional lines despite signs that the
market for such communications capacity was facing a glut and that values
were likely to plunge.</TE>
<TE>   In transferring some of these transmission rights to offshore
partnerships, former employees say, Enron wantonly overvalued them. The
company might value regional lines in the Southeast on the same scale as
lines in the Northeast, which were more heavily used and much more
valuable.</TE>
<TE>   It also would value "dark fiber"--that is, installed but unused
network capacity akin to empty pipelines--at the same value awarded "lit"
fiber, which already was interconnected to nationwide networks and
carrying data. In transferring the asset offshore, it would record the
sale on its own books as a sale at the higher, inflated values.</TE>
<TE>   But such deals also required Enron to cover any losses incurred by the
offshore partnership, usually by payments of cash or shares. This
so-called contingent liability would not be disclosed to investors, a
process that vastly inflated Enron's earnings and led to a $586-million
restatement of its earnings late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the transactions became even more questionable beginning
in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the games they played was to make them so complex that people
couldn't see where the risk lay," Vernon said. "You'd have to spend hours
with the analysts to figure it out, and then you'd be told, 'Andersen's
already signed off on this.' "</TE>

<LD>Over the years, the sight of Sara Jane Olson's face was enough to
fill Dr. Jon Opsahl with anger.</LD>
<LD>   It was the way she seemed to proffer a Norman Rockwell-like lifestyle
as a defense to charges that, more than a quarter of a century ago when
she was known as Kathleen Soliah, she allegedly helped a band of
self-styled revolutionaries who gunned down Opsahl's mother as she
deposited church offering receipts in a small-town bank branch.</LD>
<LD>   "She was a wonderful mother and helped us out in every way, and it was
kind of the parallel life that Kathleen Soliah assumed that was
disturbing, how she participated in a crime that took a life and then
kind of assumed [that lifestyle]--and to actually use that in her defense
in some ways," said Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother, Myrna Lee Opsahl,
42, was hit by a shotgun blast at a Carmichael bank branch.</LD>
<TE>   The hunt for the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army--the ragtag
leftist group that had kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst--became a
personal mission for Opsahl. He wanted to bring each member to justice,
bring his mother's forgotten story to life, and make the SLA eat their
callous words about his mother's murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Emily Harris was quoted in Patty Hearst's book as saying that her
death doesn't matter anyways, she was a bourgeois pig," Opsahl said.
"Those words have always kind of haunted us, because having the killers,
the known killers, never be held accountable kind of kept ringing true,
that her death didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "So this is very therapeutic, in the sense of realizing that it did
matter. It matters a lot to a lot of people, and we're very happy to see
that the killers will be held accountable now."</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl, who appeared at a news conference Wednesday with Sacramento
law enforcement officials, kept pressure on successive district attorneys
in Sacramento, none of whom brought charges against Sara Jane Olson,
William and Emily Harris and Michael Bortin until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>Setting Up a Web Site</TE>
<TE>   As time and technology changed, Opsahl took his quest to the Internet,
setting up a Web site, http://www.myrnaopsahl.com, where he laid out the
contours of his mother's life and the evidence he had culled over years
of meeting with law enforcement investigators in Sacramento and Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We know who was there when she was shotgunned to death," the site
says. "We know who pulled the trigger. One of the self-confessed
participants wrote a book and told us. Another of the eight broke down
and told a friend."</TE>
<TE>   The Riverside resident said he was insulted by the SLA's disdain for
his mother, and what he thought was compelling evidence that went
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Every time there was a book or movie that spotlighted Hearst or the
SLA, often in a forgiving light, his mother's story got short shrift.
None focused on the homemaker mother of four, a native of Cheyenne, Wyo.,
with Midwestern values, who grew up in Lynwood, and married a Norwegian
doctor, Trygve Opsahl, whom she met when she was a nursing student at
Loma Linda Hospital. He is now retired and living in Sonora, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   When Olson was arrested in 1999, Opsahl thought that maybe she would
tell authorities the facts about his mother's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe she regretted it and wanted to talk," he said. "But
she quickly hid behind her lawyers and put on this soccer-mom act, and
the public even came to her defense. But I said, 'Wait a minute, that was
what my mom was.' "</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl, now only a year younger than his mother was when she was
killed and working at the same hospital where his parents met, said it
paid off to be a "pest." Opsahl's resolve helped push investigators not
to let the apparently model life Olson assumed after her rebel days
eclipse the one that his mother always led.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the slight, fit physician with green eyes and
close-cropped brown hair, called himself "a small catalyst in the whole
process," and said there was more going on behind the scenes that led to
the four arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Hope returned in the summer of 2000, he said, after the family had
resigned itself to never seeing justice in their lifetimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a bit of an emotional roller coaster since the summer of
2000, when prosecutors brought some of this evidence to our attention,"
Opsahl said. "Before then, we had pretty much given up, that killers did
really get away with murder sometimes and that justice in this life isn't
always possible. Since then, it's been a very gratifying experience."</TE>
<TE>   Sonja Brownlee, 44, Myrna Opsahl's only daughter, said the arrests
should bring peace to her family, particularly to her brother Jon.</TE>
<TE>   "It affected him the most deeply," she said. "He's had the toughest
time. I think he's always determined that it was so wrong. For a while, I
really worried that he was obsessed. But he's really healthy."</TE>
<TE>Children Followed in Mom's Footsteps</TE>
<TE>   Now a pediatrician in Elko, Nev., Brownlee has three children roughly
as old as her siblings were when her mother died.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, all four Opsahl children are in their 40s, and have children
of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I think we all really miss," Brownlee said. "She didn't
get to meet any of our spouses. She doesn't know any of her
grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl said he always regretted storming out of his home on the day
his mother died, in a typical teenage huff after a tiff over not having
any pens around so he could do his homework. "I left without telling her
'I love you.' It was kind of a low moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he is sure she would have been proud of his efforts to
bring about justice. Now, he said, it is up to the courts and prosecutors
who he believes are better equipped to get a conviction than they would
have been a quarter of a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a slam-dunk, but all I've ever asked is that the known
killers be held accountable to the state's best abilities," he said. "The
conviction is secondary."</TE>

<DH>A Colorado homemaker has won praise--and arrests--for her efforts
against kiddie porn. But critics of such online crusaders call it a form
of vigilantism.</DH>

<DL>GOLDEN, Colo.
</DL>
<LD>By day, Julie Posey is a 37-year-old homemaker, tidying the
family's trailer at the foot of the Rocky Mountains and home-schooling
her daughter. But at night, Posey logs on to the Internet as Kendra--a
gum-snapping 14-year-old looking for trouble.</LD>
<LD>   This evening, she finds it in the form of an ad soliciting young girls
for sex. Sipping a cherry Coke in the blue glare of her computer screen,
Posey e-mails the man who posted the ad and awaits a reply. It doesn't
take long.</LD>
<LD>   "Do you like older men?" the stranger asks. "An older man is more
experienced, and let's face it, we've got the bucks."</LD>
<TE>   The exchange marks the start of another night's work for Posey, a
self-styled online crusader who scrolls through chat rooms and news
groups in search of sexual predators.</TE>
<TE>   Masquerading as Kendra, Posey spent two weeks exchanging graphic
e-mails with the stranger. Eventually, they arranged a rendezvous at a
local fast-food joint. When a 36-year-old computer consultant arrived
looking for Kendra, an undercover detective greeted him with handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest on suspicion of attempted sexual assault on a child was one
of nearly two dozen busts Posey has helped arrange over five years.</TE>
<TE>   As well as posing as an underage girl, Posey collects e-mail tips on
child pornography that she passes on to local police. Most recently, she
sent Irvine detectives a tip that led federal prosecutors to charge an
Orange County judge with felony possession of child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   As the reach of the Internet grows, Posey counts herself among a
handful of private citizens who have assumed the role of online crime
fighters, hoping to smoke out sexual predators and traders in kiddie
porn. They say they fill the gap that many local police departments leave
because of meager resources.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Posey, work solo. Others belong to larger volunteer bands
with bellicose names such as Predator-Hunter, Soc-Um and Cyberarmy
Pedophilia Fighters. Another group, Cyberangels, an offshoot of the
vigilante Guardian Angels in New York, claims 10,000 members who send
tips to police.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, describe their work as cyber-vigilantism that
threatens Internet privacy. The medium's promise of anonymity encourages
users to confess their secret fantasies. And privacy rights advocates
worry that crusaders entice people into fantasy play only to report them
to police.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement, for the most part, views the Internet activists as
attention-seeking busybodies. The FBI has ordered a handful of
"vigilantes" to stop. And police have arrested others for downloading
illegal pornography, which is against the law whatever the motive.</TE>
<TE>   "We really want the public's help, but not to do this," FBI Special
Agent Peter A. Gulotta said. "After all, we certainly don't expect people
to go out on the street and do drug buys for us."</TE>
<TE>   Posey appears to be the exception--winning praise from once-suspicious
cops who view her as cyperspace's answer to Nancy Drew.</TE>
<TE>   One initial doubter was Herb Crosby, a Riley County, Kan., police
lieutenant. When Posey called him about a sting she had set up a few
years ago, he telephoned other investigators she had worked with and ran
a background check on her.</TE>
<TE>   "The other agencies that had dealt with her spoke highly of her,"
Crosby said.</TE>
<TE>   At seminars taught by Posey, police officers line up to learn about
computers and chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "She's like a bulldog," said Mike Harris, a child abuse investigator
with the district attorney's office in Jefferson County, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' office has presented an award to Posey. The glass prize now
sits on a shelf in her office, a tiny room in her home in Lafayette,
Colo., west of Denver.</TE>
<TE>   It's there that Posey spends about 40 hours a week trolling the Net.
When the chat rooms are silent, she turns to her Web site,
www.pedowatch.org, a one-woman watchdog operation that has passed
hundreds of tips to police. She finances her detective work through
banner ads on the site, which have brought in as much as $1,000 a month.</TE>
<TE>   On a typical day, Posey gets up and logs on, opening a deluge of
e-mails. Most are pleas from worried parents, asking what they should do
about their children chatting with strangers on the Internet. Posey
replies to each one, suggesting ways to monitor what kids are up to
online.</TE>
<TE>   As she types, her daughter, Kristyn, 12, sits behind her, thumbing
through a textbook. Every half-hour or so, Posey interrupts her computer
work to check on Kristyn's progress or answer a chemistry question.</TE>
<TE>   Posey makes lunch, cleans up and returns to her computer. She deletes
the daily bag of critical e-mails and rare anonymous threats. "May the
next plane land on you," said a recent one. She takes none of them
seriously; no one she has busted ever tried to contact her afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Evening comes, and Posey prepares plates of spaghetti for her husband
and daughter and grills some chicken for herself. Then, it's off to
Kristyn's karate class before putting her daughter to bed. About 10 p.m.,
after Kristyn is asleep, Posey logs on again, this time as Kendra.</TE>
<TE>   As Posey's husband, a computer consultant, watches late-night talk
shows in their bedroom, his wife cruises sex chat rooms in search of what
police call "travelers"--men seeking kids online. Her husband goes to
sleep about 11 p.m., but Posey is at the computer until well past
midnight. Sometimes--"if things get really exciting"--she doesn't log off
until 3 or 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "About any time I talk to her, she's talking about one of her
convictions," Posey's father, Clint Hickman, said. "I guess it's a kind
of obsession."</TE>
<TE>   Posey hardly had the background for Internet sleuthing. She knew
little about the law before she started, and had no experience with
investigations. Her last job before motherhood was cooking meals at a
Methodist church.</TE>
<TE>   Then an ordeal that Posey had long tried to forget resurfaced.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, when Posey was 16, she was raped by a man driving a truck who
spotted her at a Denver bus stop. Posey identified a local airman as her
attacker, and he was charged with sexual assault. As part of a deal with
prosecutors, the man pleaded no contest to third-degree assault and
served 90 days in jail, according to the Jefferson County district
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, a local prosecutor contacted Posey. Her attacker was
again accused of raping a teenage girl. The prosecutor asked if Posey
would testify at the upcoming trial. She agreed, and watched with
satisfaction as a judge sentenced the rapist to 16 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The courtroom experience inspired a fascination with the justice
system. Posey volunteered to work at the Jefferson County district
attorney's office, and there she met Harris, the child abuse
investigator.</TE>
<TE>   Harris told her he was planning a sting operation against online
sexual predators. He asked if she knew anything about the Internet. Posey
had learned about computers from watching her husband at work, and she
agreed to help.</TE>
<TE>   She logged into chat rooms and pretended to be a 14-year-old girl.
Harris was shocked at how quickly strangers asked her about sex. One sent
a cell phone number to call.</TE>
<TE>   At home, Posey logged into rooms with names such as
"dadanddaughtersex" and "littlgrls."</TE>
<TE>   Many of her correspondents wanted only to fantasize, which is not
against the law. But some wanted to arrange meetings for sex, which can
result in prosecution for attempted child molestation in California and
similar charges in other states.</TE>
<TE>   One was Thomas Ormsby, the Denver computer consultant. Posey ran
across Ormsby two years ago after spotting Web ads he had posted. "Early
teens wanted," said one. "I'll molest you by e-mail," said another.</TE>
<TE>   Posey drafted a response, posing as a troubled teen. For authenticity,
she sprinkled her e-mail with punctuation errors.</TE>
<TE>   "my name is Kendra and I'm 14," she wrote. "if you want you can write
to me . . . but you might not want to talk to me because my friends say
that i am a geek and i am dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Ormsby replied, starting what became a daily e-mail exchange. It took
some time before the subject turned to sex. But when it did, Ormsby
engaged in some violent fantasies. In one, Ormsby described a sex session
he claimed to have had with an 11-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   As their correspondence continued, a pile of candy bar wrappers grew
beside Posey's computer. Next to the heap lay a list of Kendra's personal
details to help Posey sustain the charade: the teenager's hometown
(Golden, Colo.); her favorite sport (soccer); her favorite subject
(science).</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Ormsby arranged to meet Kendra at a McDonald's restaurant,
asking her to wear black spandex tights and high heels. Undercover
officers sat in wait.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1999, Ormsby pleaded guilty to attempted sexual assault of
a child. Last year he was sentenced to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   But to hear defense attorney Seth Temin explain the case, Ormsby was
the true victim.</TE>
<TE>   During his e-mail correspondence with Posey, Ormsby was encouraged to
discuss sex at every turn, Temin said. When Ormsby wasn't forward enough,
Posey kept pushing. And it took two weeks of e-mails to persuade him to
meet.</TE>
<TE>   Ormsby pleaded guilty, his lawyer said, only because he was terrified
that if prosecutors took the case to trial, he risked a sentence that,
when served, would require him to remain on parole for the rest of his
life.</TE>
<TE>   To Temin, his client's downfall illustrates how easily Internet
crusaders like Posey can encourage others to believe they can fulfill
fantasies they would otherwise keep locked away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's common for people on the Internet to fake personas," Temin said.
"Should we be peeking into people's bedrooms like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Posey makes no apologies for her work, which she said has brought her
life a sense of purpose. For years, she had felt that no one understood
the ordeal she went through as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "You talk about therapy--watching these guys cuffed and taken away,"
she said. "You think, 'They're not going to hurt a child. This is great.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Still, the idea of Posey chatting with sexual predators online at
first troubled some of her closest friends. Dolores Aaron worried that
Posey would quickly find the work too disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Aaron watched her friend change for the better, she said.
Once shy, she has become more outgoing, even outspoken at times.</TE>
<TE>   "She's no longer standing in the background seeing what was going on.
She took a big step forward," Aaron said. "I think she was made for this.
I really do."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Posey's success, other online activists have found themselves
on the receiving end of police attention.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, FBI agents believed an online activist was unwittingly
disrupting an undercover sting by targeting the same suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, sheriff's deputies in Maine seized an activist's
computer after he told them he was sent child porn over the Internet
while monitoring suspected pedophiles. Prosecutors have charged the man
with possessing illegal pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Under state and federal laws, possessing photographs of a child
engaged in a sex act is illegal, as is sending such photos over the
Internet or downloading them onto a computer.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents in Los Angeles turn away about a dozen people a year who
offer help with online sex stings, suspicious that some might be closet
pedophiles.</TE>
<TE>   "You talk to them for a bit and you get a gut feeling that something's
not quite right," Supervisory Special Agent Randy Aden said.</TE>
<TE>   Posey distances herself from such activists, but even she has run into
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Three people who volunteered to work for Posey's Web site were
arrested in separate busts for possessing illegal pictures. All claimed
they downloaded the images as part of their volunteer work, despite her
repeated warnings never to view pornography online. Frustrated and
embarrassed, Posey quit using volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Posey insists that her No. 1 rule is to never download pornography,
which involves transferring images from the Internet onto a personal
computer or disk. And she seeks frequent advice from detectives to ensure
that she does nothing illegal.</TE>
<TE>   After Ormsby, there was the 34-year-old drug addict who rented a room
for himself and Kendra, only to find a dozen officers waiting at his
motel. There was the Colorado Springs airman who contacted Kendra on a
Monday and was driving to meet her by Friday. And there was the Ohio
jailer arrested for downloading kiddie porn on his home computer.</TE>
<TE>   But Posey's latest case--one that led to the arrest of a prominent
Orange County judge--may be the one most fiercely contested.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Posey passed authorities an anonymous tip from someone who
claimed that Judge Ronald C. Kline was stocking up on illegal porn
downloaded from the Web. The unsigned e-mail also alleged that the Irvine
jurist was keeping a secret diary about his attraction to teenage boys.</TE>
<TE>   Posey tried to find out who sent the tip. Each computer on the
Internet has a unique return address, but Posey discovered that the
e-mail's address had been forged. The tipster had covered his tracks
well.</TE>
<TE>   She did a quick check online and found that Kline did live in Irvine,
and alerted California authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors allege that a search of Kline's computers
unearthed more than 100 illegal images of young boys engaging in sex and
lewd behavior. Further investigation led to child molestation charges
after a man told Irvine police that Kline sexually abused him a
quarter-century ago when the accuser was 12.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's lawyers, however, condemn the way the government obtained its
evidence. Court records show that Posey's tipster was a hacker who
communicated with Kline online about the judge's interest in boys and
exchanged photos of youngsters kissing.</TE>
<TE>   As they corresponded, the hacker infected Kline's computer with a
virus that allowed him to copy the entire contents of the judge's hard
drive. The hacker, whom prosecutors have not named, then messaged Posey
about what he had found.</TE>
<TE>   Kline has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His case, scheduled for
trial later this year, could test how far authorities can go in relying
on the work of Internet crusaders who might themselves have broken the
law.</TE>
<TE>   Posey's involvement in the Kline case ended late last summer. But her
hunt for pedophiles continues.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see me doing this all my life," Posey said. "I'll be sitting at
a computer--80 years old--telling an assistant, 'Well, tell the little
pervert to do this . . . .' "</TE>

<HD>Russian Scientist, U.S. Poles Apart Over Rescue</HD>
<DH>Antarctica: Charging his team for evacuation effort is coldhearted,
explorer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>An explorer flies all the way to the South Pole but has to ask
someone else to fly him out. Question: What is it called? a) A triumph of
aviation? b) An embarrassment? c) A diplomatic snafu?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: All three.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 8, Artur Chilingarov, a deputy speaker of Russia's parliament
and a polar scientist, flew with some adventurous buddies to the South
Pole. He claimed that their An-3 biplane, which flew about 750 miles over
the Antarctic landscape before landing at the Earth's southernmost point,
was the first single-engine aircraft to make the trip. Their derring-do
earned them a congratulatory phone call at the South Pole from Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<TE>   But for some reason--some say that the engine wouldn't restart, others
simply that the weather was bad--the plane couldn't make the trip out. So
Chilingarov had to ask the United States, which has a research base at
the South Pole, to rescue him.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest indignity was yet to come--the U.S. Antarctic Program
is billing the Russian government $80,000 for his rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "We by law are not permitted to provide assistance to private
expeditions," explained Peter West, spokesman for the U.S. government's
National Science Foundation, which administers the program. "We reserve
the right to recover our costs if we have to provide humanitarian
assistance to private groups," he said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Chilingarov says he wasn't told that the rescue would cost money and
that if he'd known he might not have accepted the help. Regardless, he
insists, asking for money violates the spirit of cooperation on the
continent, which is internationally recognized as nonmilitary territory
for scientific exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems some American bureaucrats have forgotten the principle of
polar cooperation," he huffed in an interview with the Komsomolskaya
Pravda daily. "I myself have more than once pulled Americans out of very
difficult situations, and I did it absolutely for free."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department has gotten involved, certifying that,
indeed, Chilingarov's expedition wasn't officially sponsored by the
Russian government and so he is liable for the rescue costs. Chilingarov
plans to discuss the matter with the U.S. ambassador in Moscow this week.
The Russian government has so far remained mum on the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems some people aren't happy we made it to the South Pole," he
groused at a news conference Wednesday. He didn't say who those people
might be.</TE>
<TE>Expedition Defended</TE>
<TE>   The incident appears to have embarrassed Chilingarov, one of Russia's
most accomplished polar scientists, who grew defensive about questions as
to the wisdom of his trip. At the news conference, he bristled at
suggestions that he was on a high-risk joy ride with fellow travelers
rich enough to buy into his Antarctic adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't deny that there is an element of adventurism in any
expedition," Chilingarov said. "But for a polar explorer, common sense
and cowardice are not the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Chilingarov, 62, trained as an oceanographer and geographer and has
participated in Soviet and Russian Arctic and Antarctic programs steadily
since the 1960s, earning a Hero of the Soviet Union award. Since 1993, he
has been a member of the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State
Duma, where he is now one of eight deputy speakers.</TE>
<TE>   Chilingarov said he set off from Punta Arenas, Chile, near the
southern tip of South America, on Jan. 7 in a Russian Il-76 jet with the
dismantled An-3 in the cargo bay. He and his party landed at Patriot
Hills in western Antarctica, a common staging ground for private
expeditions, and reassembled the An-3.</TE>
<TE>   They left for the South Pole the following day, he said--seven
Russians and seven other passengers who had contributed to the air fare.
Chilingarov refused to identify the other passengers, but news reports
said they included citizens of Ukraine, France, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United States whose fares helped pay for the estimated $1-million
trip.</TE>
<TE>   The flight lasted about 6 1/2 hours, Chilingarov said. When they
arrived at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, they were greeted
warmly by the U.S. scientists, presented with certificates commemorating
their journey and given a tour of the base. The scientists were
"stunned," he said, when Putin phoned to congratulate the group. The
Russians planted a Russian flag.</TE>
<TE>   From that point, things began to go wrong. And explanations of what
happened next begin to diverge.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference Wednesday, Chilingarov said the major factor in
the decision not to fly the An-3 back was the weather, which had taken a
sudden turn for the worse.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to emphasize that the plane was in working order," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some news reports, however, have said that the engine wouldn't restart
after it had been shut off for several hours. West, of the U.S. National
Science Foundation, said Chilingarov made a request to the State
Department asking that his plane be refueled. It wasn't clear if that
request meant that the aircraft was low on fuel.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 10, West said, a C-130 Hercules operated by the New York Air
National Guard picked up Chilingarov and the other Russians and flew them
first to the main U.S. base in Antarctica, McMurdo, from which they were
later flown to New Zealand. The foreign travelers flew back to Patriot
Hills with a commercial adventure tour company.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue has been left out of most official Russian reports about
the trip. "The expedition fully accomplished its program," the official
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chilingarov as saying. The pro-Kremlin ORT
network, which provided Chilingarov with a cameraman, has run a number of
reports this week on the trip, not one of which has mentioned the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Chilingarov said the point of his trip was to raise Russia's profile
in the Antarctic and emphasize the international nature of the continent.</TE>
<TE>   The United States operates three year-round research bases on the
continent, including Amundsen-Scott. The Soviet Union once operated five
year-round stations, one of which Chilingarov directed in the 1970s. In
the last decade, Russia has had to cut back its presence.</TE>
<TE>'A Waste of Time'</TE>
<TE>   Valery Lukin, head of the Russian government's Antarctic Expedition,
denounced Chilingarov's trip as a stunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a good English term for it--adventure tourism," he said by
telephone from his office in St. Petersburg. "This is what Chilingarov's
trip to the South Pole can be most likely called. From the scientific
point of view, the trip was a waste of time."</TE>
<TE>   Lukin also said the United States is entirely justified in charging
private citizens for rescues. Since the Antarctic Treaty was signed,
government expeditions have traditionally extended assistance to each
other without regard to cost; the same assistance is not automatically
provided to private adventurers.</TE>
<TE>   "All private expeditions are encouraged to be self-sufficient," West
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the bill ever arrives in his mailbox, Chilingarov said, he will pay
for the rescue himself: "If we have any financial obligations, we will
meet them." He said he took out insurance for the trip and insisted that
the Russian government has not and will not finance the trip in any way.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the An-3 biplane remains parked near the 3-foot-high
striped pole that marks the official bottom of the globe, awaiting
rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Chilingarov told Komsomolskaya Pravda that he plans to head south
again later this month, this time with two monks in his entourage. They
will erect a chapel at the pole and sing an Orthodox liturgy.</TE>
<TE>   "In any case," he said, "for the honor of Russia, they will try."</TE>

<HD>4 SLA Figures Arrested in '75 Bank Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Sara Jane Olson, the Harrises and two others are accused of
a shooting described in a book by Patty Hearst.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A full generation after their alleged crime, William and Emily
Harris and Sara Jane Olson, co-survivors of the weird and violent
revolutionary movement known as the Symbionese Liberation Army, were
arrested Wednesday and charged with murdering a Sacramento-area church
volunteer during a 1975 bank robbery.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth person, Michael Bortin, was arrested on similar charges. The
case was notorious in part because kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia
Hearst admitted taking part and described in a book how the robbery and
killing took place.</LD>
<LD>   Hearst, who said she was brainwashed by the cult-like terrorist group,
was long ago granted immunity from prosecution for her role. She told her
story to at least one grand jury, but her testimony was not enough to
bring charges.</LD>
<TE>   The arrests came two days before Olson, who changed her name from
Kathleen Soliah and spent years as a fugitive, was scheduled to be
sentenced in Los Angeles County Superior Court for her role in an SLA
bomb plot. Prosecutors said they acted now because they had collected
enough evidence in the bombing case to file charges in the bank murder.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who pleaded guilty in the attempted bombing, has denied taking
part in the robbery at a Crocker National Bank branch in Carmichael, a
Sacramento suburb.</TE>
<TE>   After a tearful goodbye to her husband and three daughters, she
surrendered to authorities Wednesday afternoon at her lawyer's office in
Beverly Hills. The other three suspects had been arrested in quick
succession Wednesday morning, Emily Harris near her home in Altadena,
William Harris while driving his sons to school in Oakland, and Bortin at
his home in Portland, Ore. All four were being held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Murder charges were also filed against a fifth suspect, James Kilgore,
who vanished years ago and remains at large.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were a bittersweet requital for the family of Myrna
Opsahl, who was making a deposit on behalf of the Carmichael Seventh-day
Adventist Church when she was shot at close range on April 21, 1975. She
left behind a husband and four children, including a 15-year-old son, Jon
Opsahl, who later became a physician in Riverside County and dedicated
himself to seeing that his mother's killers were brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our family has waited 26 years for this day," Jon Opsahl said at a
news conference in Sacramento. Turning to Sacramento County Sheriff Lou
Blanas, he added: "It's about time."</TE>
<TE>   Blanas smiled and put a hand on Opsahl's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Opsahl said that before Los Angeles prosecutors brought evidence to
the family in the summer of 2000, he and his father and siblings had
largely given up. Three previous Sacramento County district attorneys did
not believe there was enough evidence to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the arrests provoked questions, coming just two days
before Olson's sentencing on charges of planting a bomb under a Los
Angeles police car in 1975. The bomb never exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. James E. Lewis said the
charges--developed by a task force created last March--were primarily
based on thousands of pieces of existing evidence and hundreds of
statements from witnesses that were accumulated, reviewed and prepared
for prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   And Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Jan Scully said there is additional
corroborating evidence implicating the five suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "Using forensic testing procedures not available until recently," she
said, "the FBI laboratory linked the lead pellets that killed Mrs. Opsahl
to shotgun shells found in an SLA hide-out in San Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 arrest of Olson--who had spent 23 years as a fugitive, most
of them as a middle-class housewife and mother in suburban
Minneapolis--helped restart an investigation that had long since gone
cold, said Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley. "That is what
broke it open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's arrest allowed Los Angeles police and prosecutors to reexamine
a mountain of evidence collected by Sacramento County authorities in
connection with the Carmichael robbery and murder. Authorities said Olson
did not provide any information to further the bank murder case.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Attys. Michael Latin and Eleanor
Hunter have said forensics experts linked live shells found in the bank
and shotgun projectiles in Opsahl's body with ammunition in the Harrises'
San Francisco apartment. Olson's palm print was also found in a
Sacramento garage where SLA members stored the getaway car from the
Carmichael robbery, they said.</TE>
<TE>Officials Guess at Use of Stolen Money</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Latin have said they believe the Carmichael bank robbery
helped pay for bomb-making materials and for the car used to drive the
conspirators to Southern California, where they then attempted to blow up
Los Angeles Police Department cars, including one parked behind the
International House of Pancakes on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The SLA was one of the oddest and most violent bands of
revolutionaries to emerge from the tumult of the Vietnam War era. The
group was founded in the Bay Area in the early 1970s with the goal of
fomenting violent revolution. Its oft-repeated slogan was: "Death to the
fascist insect that preys on the life of the people."</TE>
<TE>   It sprang into headlines in November 1973 with the murder of Marcus
Foster, the Oakland city schools superintendent. The group--which
numbered no more than a dozen members at a time--then kidnapped Hearst,
whose grandfather founded the Hearst publishing empire. Within months,
she had emerged as "Tania," a convert to the SLA's cause. She served two
years in federal prison, but was later pardoned by President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Los Angeles prosecutors said documents in the
Harrises' San Francisco apartment clearly link the SLA to the Carmichael
bank robbery. Those documents included escape routes, layouts of the
bank, surveillance notes and a typewritten strategy outline.</TE>
<TE>   The robbery was scheduled for 9 a.m. on April 21, 1975. Olson,
Kilgore, Emily Harris and Bortin agreed to be the masked gunmen inside,
while William Harris, Hearst, Wendy Yoshimura and Steven Soliah, Olson's
brother, made up the getaway team, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the bank, the four robbers ordered bank employees and customers
to the floor. A female robber fired a single round from her sawed-off
12-gauge shotgun, hitting Opsahl, who was depositing the collection from
her church's Sunday service. Meanwhile, the other robbers collected cash
from the tellers' drawers, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   The team stole more than $15,000 in cash, and then fled in getaway
vehicles to safe houses in Sacramento, authorities said. Harris told the
others she shot the woman, court papers said, and "seemed very casual
about the shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Yoshimura and Hearst were given immunity from prosecution.
In 1976, Steven Soliah was tried and acquitted of bank robbery charges.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors' account is similar to the description given by Hearst
in her 1982 book, "Every Secret Thing." She wrote that the night before
the robbery, Kilgore, Olson and Steve Soliah drove to UC Davis and placed
stolen plates on their stolen cars, a Firebird and a Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Hearst wrote, she drove the Firebird getaway car and
was parked outside the bank while Emily Harris, Olson, Kilgore and Mike
Bortin went inside. Others, including William Harris, Yoshimura and Steve
Soliah, helped outside.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them wore disguises, including ski masks and wigs, she wrote.
Hearst wrote that Bortin stood on a teller's counter and waved his gun
around, Olson emptied the tellers' drawers and Emily Harris shot the
female customer. "No one was bragging about the success of this venture,"
which netted about $15,000, she wrote.</TE>
<TE>Book Describes Reaction to Shooting</TE>
<TE>   When Olson asked about the condition of the woman who had been shot,
according to the book, Harris said, "Oh she's dead, but it really doesn't
matter. She was a bourgeois pig anyway." Emily Harris said the shotgun
had gone off by accident when she pushed the gun into the woman to make
her get down onto the floor, according to the book.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Opsahl said his family never forgot the "bourgeois pig" remark.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Stebner, 80, volunteers once a week at the Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Carmichael and was a close friend of Myrna Opsahl's.
She recalled that the women of the church divided the duty of counting
the church collection and depositing the money in the bank every Monday.
The day Myrna Opsahl was killed, she had agreed to do the job for another
volunteer who was busy that day, Stebner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God that something is finally happening," she added. "I thank
the district attorney and also the son."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests of the two Harrises and Bortin were carefully timed, and
occurred within 16 minutes of each other, according to the Sacramento
County sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:02 a.m., California Highway Patrol officers and Sacramento
district attorney's investigators stopped Emily Harris' car in the 700
block of Altadena Drive, a few hundred yards from the Spanish-style home
where she has lived quietly as Emily Montague, her unmarried name.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked her to get out of her car, and she did," said CHP Officer
Vincent Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who served nearly eight years in prison for kidnapping Hearst,
has been working as a computer analyst, with little if any involvement in
politics.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris and Bortin were both arrested at 8:18 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the odd twists of the case that Bortin and Olson are
related by marriage--he is married to her sister, Josephine
Soliah-Bortin.</TE>
<TE>   Soliah-Bortin, 50, said she and her husband awoke to find police in
bulletproof vests surrounding their house and demanding he come outside
with his hands above his head. She said officers ordered him to get down
on the ground and then pointed guns at his head as they handcuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband has owned a hardwood flooring business for 20
years. The couple have been married since 1988 and have four children.</TE>
<TE>   She said her husband has denied participation in the Carmichael
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris, 57, who served a sentence similar to his ex-wife's for
kidnapping Hearst, works as a private investigator in San Francisco. He
was taking his two sons to school when he was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times two years ago, he said he sometimes
wondered how he was going to tell his sons about his revolutionary past.
His older son, 11 at the time, "knows something is going on," Harris
said. "I'll sit down with him when he's 18 and try to explain it to him."</TE>
<TE>Suspects Earlier Denied Involvement in Robbery</TE>
<TE>   William Harris arrived in custody in Sacramento around noon Wednesday.
Emily Harris arrived shortly before 4 p.m. They will be arraigned Friday.
Michael Bortin was still in Oregon pending an extradition hearing. The
suspects all denied any involvement with the bank robbery in earlier
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Olson heard about the other arrests, she and her family
went to the office of her attorney, Shawn Chapman. Chapman said she had
contacted Sacramento County prosecutors and learned that an arrest
warrant had been issued for Olson.</TE>
<TE>   The prosectors had asked that she be arrested Friday at her
sentencing. But the Sacramento sheriff's office called Chapman and told
her deputies were not going to allow someone suspected of murder to
remain free, and "that either you make arrangements for her surrender or
we'll come and find her," the attorney said. She said the sheriff's
department gave her two hours to surrender her client.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said she called Olson, who turned 55 on Wednesday, and she
arrived with her family at the office about 3:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Olson was booked at the Twin Towers jail on suspicion of murder and
will be arraigned Tuesday in Sacramento.</TE>

<KH>THE ENRON INQUIRY</KH>
<HD>Enron Exec Warned Auditors on Practices</HD>
<DH>Probe: Watkins alerted Andersen last summer about accounting
policies now at center of an investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins warned the company's
auditors, Andersen, about a series of questionable accounting practices
that now are the focus of investigations of the energy company's
collapse, congressional investigators said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins alerted the company in an Aug. 20 phone call with an
unidentified Andersen employee, who in turn relayed the concerns to
senior Andersen management on the Enron account and in Andersen's Houston
office, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said Watkins' warning cast further doubt on claims by
Enron and Andersen officials that they were unaware of the company's dire
financial straits last summer. The disclosure followed release of a
letter this week showing that Watkins had given a similar warning to
Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August.</LD>
<TE>   "It's clear now to us that key players at Andersen as well as Enron
knew of the growing problem months before the company imploded," said Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the continuing probe, committee investigators in Washington
met for about 4 1/2 hours with an Andersen partner, David Duncan, who was
fired Tuesday by the company for allegedly ordering the destruction of
thousands of Enron-related documents beginning in late October.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who has said through his attorney that he was following
company orders, was among the Andersen officials briefed about Watkins'
concerns, investigators said Wednesday. Johnson said Duncan was
cooperative, answering all questions and providing "some valuable leads
that we are now pursuing."</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman, Patrick Dorton, said the firm is still
conducting an internal investigation. "If we find that anyone did
anything improper, we'll take the appropriate action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said that Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen, reviewed
and approved the company's accounting practices. "We placed very heavy
reliance on Arthur Andersen, as will become very clear," said Robert
Bennett, Enron's Washington attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are attempting to apportion responsibility for the
collapse last year of the energy company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2, and to determine whether questionable accounting and
lax audits helped deceive investors and employees. The collapse cost
investors and Enron employees billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The latest revelations suggest that the rapidly evolving investigation
could turn on the testimony of insiders such as Duncan and Watkins. The
Justice and Labor departments, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
several congressional panels are investigating whether Enron and its
auditor withheld information from employees and investors that led to
billions of dollars in losses as the company's stock plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the inquiry is focusing on a series of partnerships to which
Enron shifted debt, keeping it off the company's books, where it could
have a negative effect on Enron's financial picture.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they found the Andersen memo articulating Watkins'
concerns while digging through 80 boxes of documents.</TE>
<TE>   The three-page internal memo written by the unidentified Andersen
employee said in reference to Watkins' concerns, "Based on our
discussion, I told her she appeared to have some good questions."</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 21, the employee called an emergency meeting with other
Andersen employees, including Duncan, to discuss what Watkins had said.
They "agreed to consult with the firm's legal advisor about what actions
to take in response to [Watkins'] discussions of potential accounting and
disclosure issues," according to an excerpt of the memo.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen spokesman said that after Watkins contacted the firm,
officials notified Enron's general counsel and were told that law firm
Vinson &amp; Elkins was conducting an investigation. That investigation
acknowledged that the accounting treatment of the suspect partnerships
was "creative and aggressive" but that it was not "inappropriate from a
technical standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigation, said the newly
discovered internal Andersen memo "raises additional concerns about
Andersen's knowledge of potential accounting irregularities and the
subsequent destruction of Enron-related documents."</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure came as Duncan met with a team of eight House Energy
and Commerce Committee investigators in his lawyer's Washington office.
Duncan spoke without any promise of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators called it an "informal" interview. Duncan was not sworn
in, but he was warned about the prohibition against giving false
statements to Congress or its investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion ranged from the destruction of documents to internal
memos to his handling of the Enron account.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we're trying to determine who knew what and when they knew
it," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Duncan is continuing to cooperate with all investigations and
looks forward to the full disclosure of the truth," said Robert Giuffra,
attorney for Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   The Duncan interview was dominated by questions about the destruction
of Enron-related documents and the accounting methods used for numerous
Enron partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he told investigators that he was merely following
company policy and was not told by Andersen's lawyers to begin preserving
Enron documents until Nov. 9, more than two weeks after the Securities
and Exchange Commission probe was disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   However, a representative for Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), top
Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said, "Our investigators
were disappointed by the limited nature of Mr. Duncan's memory. We expect
documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators see Duncan as a potential star witness because of his
knowledge of Enron's complex accounting methods--including the
partnerships that kept debt off the books--and Andersen's handling of
those books.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million and
disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Nov. 8, it
announced that it had overstated its earnings by $586 million during the
last four years, sparking a massive loss of confidence on Wall Street. In
a year, the stock price went from more than $90 a share to less than $1.</TE>
<TE>   One experienced former congressional investigator suggested that the
committees are moving too quickly by holding public hearings and
conducting key interviews before investigators fully understand how Enron
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "Any serious investigation will take four to six months just to get
your hands on the documents and use them to build a chronology and flow
charts," said Jack Blum, a former Democratic Senate investigator who
worked on such inquiries as the BCCI banking scandal, Gen. Manuel
Noriega's drug trafficking and Lockheed overseas bribes.</TE>
<TE>   "How are [congressional investigators] going to pin anybody down until
they get all the facts and know the right questions to ask?" said Blum,
now a Washington attorney. "At this point, investigators aren't going to
know whether something someone says is real or a lot of smoke."</TE>
<TE>   Blum said he was "amazed" that House Energy and Commerce investigators
decided to interview Duncan without first looking into allegations by
Andersen that he had ordered the destruction of thousands of Enron
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, because the investigation is still at such an early stage,
Blum said that Lay's expected Feb. 4 appearance before a Senate
subcommittee looks more like a "morality play" than an attempt to unravel
the Enron mess and learn what the government could do to prevent similar
meltdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Brand, a former House counsel, said he was surprised that
Duncan would talk to investigators without seeking immunity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's singing for his supper in a way," he said. "He's going to be
regarded by prosecutors and others as a potential target unless and until
he can trade up. . . . He has to turn the focus on other people in a big
way, or else the government is going to visit their missiles on him."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen fired Duncan on Tuesday, saying he had ordered the
destruction of thousand of Enron-related documents Oct. 23, after the
Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   The records destruction is believed to have ended Nov. 9, when
Duncan's assistant sent a "stop the shredding" e-mail, a day after
Andersen received a subpoena, according to Andersen officials.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's meeting with investigators came as Enron's and Andersen's
extensive business and political ties continued to complicate the
investigation and create awkwardness for Washington officials.</TE>
<TE>   Top congressional Democrats called on the head of the Justice
Department's criminal investigation to step aside, saying his former law
firm represented Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson declined to recuse himself,
saying that he had never represented Enron at his old law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and the U.S.
attorney's entire Houston office recused themselves because of possible
conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, questioned whether the Justice Department could fairly
investigate Andersen's role in the Enron scandal at the same time that a
branch of the firm holds a $700,000 management consulting contract with
the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, working with the Justice Department to help reorganize the
FBI after a series of setbacks at the bureau, has access to confidential
and sensitive FBI documents filed as part of its consulting work, Leahy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said the Justice Department needs to ensure that proper
safeguards are put in place so that potential conflicts do not "taint"
the Enron investigation. The potential for conflict "raises obvious
concerns and questions," Leahy wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said that although he had not yet read Leahy's letter, he is
satisfied that the branch of Andersen now acting as a consultant in the
FBI reorganization is "completely different and separate from the firm's
accounting practice," which is embroiled in the Enron affair.</TE>
<TE>   "We will review any kinds of concerns that come to our attention with
the very good and able ethics officials at the department," Thompson
added. "And rest assured that we will handle this investigation like all
other investigations--that is, to make certain that we do everything
possible to avoid any kind of appearance of impropriety or
inappropriateness."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) issued a 23-page
report, "How the White House Energy Plan Benefited Enron," while again
assailing Vice President Dick Cheney for refusing to make public details
of his and his energy task force's private meetings with Enron officials
and other outside interests during last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, officials said economic advisor Larry Lindsey, a
former Enron consultant, had studied how an Enron collapse could affect
energy and financial markets. But Lindsey's work was "not in reaction to
any phone calls they had with Enron officials," spokesman Ari Fleischer
said. Lindsey concluded that the company's problems would not cause
significant disruptions, Fleischer said.</TE>

<DH>West Bank: Brooklyn-born Avraham Boaz felt more at ease with his
Palestinian 'extended family' than in Israeli society, mourners say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIT JALA, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Avraham Boaz, a Jew, and Jamal Arza, a Palestinian, shared a
friendship so old and so strong that it endured through the fighting that
has raged between their peoples for more than 15 months.</LD>
<LD>   Even when gunmen in this Palestinian village fired at the nearby
Jewish neighborhood of Gilo, and Israel retaliated by shelling Beit Jala,
the decades-old bond between Arza, the villager, and Boaz, the settler,
survived.</LD>
<LD>   But Tuesday, the cycle of revenge killings that has become the
leitmotif of this conflict proved more powerful than Boaz and Arza's love
for each other.</LD>
<TE>   A Brooklyn-born architect, Boaz had continued to build houses with a
Palestinian partner in Beit Jala long after most Israelis became too
fearful to walk its narrow streets.</TE>
<TE>   Although he moved to Israel in 1962, Boaz never became an Israeli
citizen. He later relocated to the Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim in
the West Bank. His U.S. passport got him through Israeli checkpoints
after the army banned Israelis from Palestinian-controlled areas. Boaz
thought the passport--and his friendship with Arza and many other
villagers--would protect him from Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   It did, until Tuesday. One day after Israel assassinated a Palestinian
militia leader, gunmen seeking revenge stopped his car at a Palestinian
police checkpoint and drove Boaz, a 71-year-old who walked with the aid
of crutches, to nearby Beit Sahur. There, they beat and shot him to death
in a muddy soccer field.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of a man who had developed such deep relations with
Palestinians left both sides wondering whether it will ever be possible
to erase the hatred that has grown between them during fighting that has
claimed more than 1,000 lives.</TE>
<TE>   "He would call his many Palestinian friends 'my extended family,' "
Yifat Cohen-Haddad, a relative, said at Boaz's Jerusalem funeral
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "You stuck to your principles even when your family began to worry . .
. even though we couldn't understand how you could do so as everything
burned around us," she said in eulogizing Boaz.</TE>
<TE>   Through all the months of conflict, Boaz had remained a frequent
visitor at Arza's Everest Hotel on Beit Jala's outskirts, where he
lunched with the family several times a week and often stayed the night.</TE>
<TE>   "He was my brother," the 65-year-old Arza said simply.</TE>
<TE>   At the Arzas' hotel, family members tried to make sense of it all
Wednesday as they sat in the cavernous, empty restaurant that was
routinely filled with Israelis before the outbreak of violence in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>Shaken Faith in Peace</TE>
<TE>   A few feet from where they huddled, the Arzas had shared rice and
salads the day before with the man they called "Avi."</TE>
<TE>   Makram Arza, Jamal's son, blamed what he called the Israeli army's
heavy-handed response to Palestinian attacks for the surging hatred
expressed in Boaz's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Blockades of towns and villages, destruction of homes, killings,
arrests and other measures, he said, have "broken this connection between
the people. What will we do after all this destruction? The normal people
have lost everything. How will people be able to trust? How will people
be able to live with people? This is what we have lost between Israelis
and Palestinians."</TE>
<TE>   The architect had come for his first lunch with the family since his
wife died of cancer 10 days before. After lingering over the meal, he
drove to Beit Jala with one of Jamal's sons, Bashir. The pair planned to
pick out furniture for an apartment that Boaz had rented in a nearby
Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   They never made it to the store. At a Palestinian police roadblock,
gunmen commandeered the car. They pistol-whipped Bashir and threw him
into the street, then drove off with Boaz. Within an hour, his
bullet-riddled body and car were found in Beit Sahur. A militia linked to
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement claimed responsibility for the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Although his wife and daughter were Israelis, Boaz never felt that he
fit into Israeli society, said Evyatar Cohen, Boaz's son-in-law. Boaz
often told his daughter, Idit, that he only truly felt at home with the
Arzas, Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Avi thought he was immune, bulletproof," Cohen said. "I can only hope
people will no longer go there. There is no chance. It's hopeless. It's a
fact. . . . The sad case of Avi Boaz just proves that there's no hope. We
need total separation."</TE>
<TE>   In Beit Jala on Wednesday, residents who knew Boaz as a familiar
figure at the village greengrocer and the barbershop expressed shock and
outrage at his killing.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the man for 30 years," Judeh Saleh said. ". . . I cried when
they told me that he was killed."</TE>
<TE>   "He came for his haircut Thursday or Friday," said Khalil Mattar,
Boaz's barber for the last five years. "One time I asked him: 'Avi, why
do you risk your life to have your hair cut?' He said: 'I'm an American.
Everyone knows me here.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Arzas said they cannot think of a punishment harsh enough for
Boaz's killers. The Palestinian Authority condemned his slaying Tuesday
night, but the gunmen who killed him remained at large Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Arza said his friendship with Boaz began in 1968, a few months
after Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan. Boaz walked into the
Everest and struck up a conversation with Arza, a Christian Palestinian
hotelier. The two spoke in the only language both knew, English. They
soon found that they shared a sense of humor and a love of Arab food.
Over the years, Arza taught Boaz Arabic and Boaz taught his friend
Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>Families Grew Close</TE>
<TE>   Boaz began bringing his wife, Eve, to dine with the Arzas. When Bashir
was born, the Boazes visited Jamal's wife, Nawal, in the hospital and
brought the baby a gift. The next year, the Arzas visited Eve in the
hospital when she gave birth to Idit, their only child, and brought a
gift. The couples traveled to Egypt and Jordan together. Years later,
Idit attended Bashir's wedding and he attended hers.</TE>
<TE>   When a younger Arza son, Anwar, was married recently, Boaz lent the
family his silver convertible to be decorated as the bride and groom's
car for the wedding. It was the same car he was driving when he was
killed.</TE>
<TE>   After learning that her father had been slain and that Bashir Arza has
been injured by gunmen, Idit Cohen called Jamal Arza.</TE>
<TE>   "She asked, 'How is my brother, Bashir?' " Jamal Arza said. "I said:
'Bashir will be all right. You have lost a father. I have lost a
brother.' "</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before Boaz was buried, Palestinian gunmen killed a
Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem driving in the West Bank. Israeli
police said they believe that the gunmen didn't realize that the man
driving the car with Israeli license plates was an Arab.</TE>

<HD>Another Wall Falls in Berlin</HD>
<DH>Germany: An east-west local alliance of reformed Communists and the
nation's ruling party could unite the capital, most residents hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>A coalition uniting leftist parties of Germany's east and west
takes power in this bankrupt capital today, forging an experimental
partnership that some see as the crowning glory of reunification and
others as a political sellout that could cost Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder his job in elections this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The alliance of reformed Communists and Schroeder's Social Democrats
after months of negotiation has inspired hope and celebration among most
Berliners, symbolizing a genuine growing together of the two sides of a
city that the Cold War divided and claimed as its front line.</LD>
<LD>   But the coalition agreement signed Wednesday also led several
prominent Social Democrats to resign from Schroeder's party in protest of
a pact that they think unites them with former oppressors who built the
Berlin Wall and shot those trying to escape.</LD>
<TE>   The nine-member government to be sworn in today replaces a
transitional leadership put in place seven months ago after Berlin's
strangling financial crisis brought down a "grand coalition" led by the
conservative Christian Democratic Union.</TE>
<TE>   The capital, which has the status of one of Germany's 16 federal
states, is mired in debts of $36 billion and has had to mortgage museums
and monuments to the federal government because it can't afford to
maintain them. The German government moved to Berlin from Bonn in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   By uniting Schroeder's party and the former Communists, now known as
the Party of Democratic Socialism, the coalition agreement will test
whether the leftist politicians from across the former divide can
cooperate and compromise for the collective good of Berlin's 3.5 million
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Both parties can now make the unity of our city into something it has
not yet experienced. Citizens of east and west can now feel themselves
equally represented," said Stefan Liebich, the Berlin leader of the PDS.
"This is a great day for Berlin."</TE>
<TE>   Berlin's mayor, Social Democrat Klaus Wowereit, who is Germany's first
openly gay state leader, initially tried to negotiate a three-party
coalition with the environmentalist Greens--with whom Schroeder's party
governs at the national level--and the pro-business Liberal Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   But that proposed concoction proved too politically unwieldy, forcing
the Social Democrats to reconsider partnership with the former Communists
despite the fact that a sizable share of the membership of Schroeder's
party was staunchly opposed to collaborating with descendants of the
architects of division.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve members of the Berlin chapter of the Social Democrats resigned
after the 120-page coalition deal was signed, including two prominent
figures in the Cold War-era resistance to the Communist forces that then
surrounded and isolated West Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Democrats won 30% of the October Berlin vote, called after
the last government was felled in June by the finance scandal. The PDS
earned 23%, just shy of the 24% garnered by the Christian Democrats, who
were long the most powerful party in Berlin and are held responsible for
the reckless spending that plunged the capital into debt.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder has called the PDS partnership here a result of unique
circumstances, rather than a test of the parties' ability to work
together that could be repeated at the national level. Federal elections
are set for Sept. 22, and Schroeder faces a tough challenge from the
conservatives, who have been casting the Berlin coalition deal as a moral
capitulation.</TE>
<TE>   The PDS still harbors some throwbacks, but its most influential
members reflect the transformation of the party since the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Gregor Gysi, a charismatic lawyer who is the most popular figure in
the PDS, has taken on the all-important role of Berlin economics chief--a
post that will force the welfare-oriented party to make painful cuts in
social security if the capital is to escape its financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Berlin experiment with east-west rapprochement is a
one-time political gamble, it will probably become a yardstick for
measuring the Social Democrats' success in overcoming economic woes that
could influence the federal elections.</TE>

<HD>Poland, Russia Begin to Heal Old Wounds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW
</DL>
<LD>The presidents of Russia and Poland, both former Communists,
declared a new era of friendlier ties Wednesday after a decade of tension
between their two countries.</LD>
<LD>   "I firmly believe that the difficult period of the 1990s is over,"
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said at a joint news conference
with Russia's Vladimir V. Putin.</LD>
<LD>   After the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989, the two countries'
ties were strained by Warsaw's rapid turn to the West and its 1999
admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization despite vehement
Russian protests.</LD>
<TE>   Relations hit a low point in January 2000 when Warsaw expelled nine
Russian diplomats for alleged espionage. Moscow responded the next day by
kicking out nine Polish diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   But Kwasniewski said Poland and Russia are now democratic countries
with an opportunity to build a relationship "based on the same values,
the same way of thinking, the same approach to good-neighborly
relations." Kwasniewski, a fluent Russian speaker, met Putin in July 2000
for a summit in Moscow that launched the turnaround in relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's meeting is decisive because it really closes a certain stage
and creates a platform for moving forward," said Putin, whose visit to
Poland is the first by a Russian president since Boris N. Yeltsin came in
1993. "We have succeeded in jointly overcoming old stereotypes."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian delegation stressed that the visit, which ends today,
focuses on economic ties as well as political and security issues. But
the Polish public and media were largely interested in its symbolism.
There was great speculation before Putin's arrival that he might make
some dramatic gesture of reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>Step Toward an Apology</TE>
<TE>   Putin went halfway toward fulfilling those hopes by placing flowers at
the Monument to the Home Army Soldiers, a memorial to Poland's
underground army that resisted Nazi Germany during World War II. Many of
the army's commanders were imprisoned or executed by Poland's
Soviet-installed Communist regime after the end of the war, so Putin's
act could be seen as implying a certain degree of contrition or apology.</TE>
<TE>   But the Russian leader stayed away from two other monuments that Poles
regard with even more emotion. One is the Monument to the Warsaw
Uprising, a 1944 rebellion against Nazi rule that was crushed by the
Germans while the Soviet army sat on the other side of the Vistula River
from the main part of Warsaw. That defeat--which most Poles believe the
Soviet army could have prevented--led to enormous loss of Polish lives
and the almost complete destruction of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The other monument recalls the deportation of many Poles to the Soviet
Union after the Soviets and Germany partitioned Poland in the early
stages of World War II, before they went to war against each other. Many
deportees did not survive.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference, Putin offered a blunt assessment of Soviet
behavior that fell short of an apology for decades of repression but
still could help heal old wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The former Soviet Union tried to dominate not only in Eastern Europe
but also in other parts of the world," Putin said. "This was not to the
benefit of the Russian nation, nor did it create a positive reaction by
our quasi-partners, partners who did not have free choice. Particularly
Poles are not willing to accept any form of dictate."</TE>
<TE>Poland Called 'Partner'</TE>
<TE>   But now Russia wants to build its economic and political ties with
Poland, Putin said. "Poland is a full partner for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Polish Public Television had strong praise for Putin's visit to the
Home Army monument, saying it proved wrong those who considered him
incapable of an unexpected gesture.</TE>
<TE>   But the private TVN network compared Putin's gesture unfavorably with
far more dramatic ones, including Kwasniewski's apology last year for a
1941 massacre of Polish Jews by their neighbors during Nazi occupation
and former German Chancellor Willy Brandt's demonstration of remorse at a
monument to the failed 1943 ghetto uprising by Warsaw's doomed Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Rzeczpospolita, a leading newspaper, said in an editorial Wednesday
that it was premature for Putin to make a gesture similar to Brandt's
when polls indicate that Russians would not be ready to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Kwasniewski appealed at the news conference for both countries to put
their differences aside and work together to build a united Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "All divisions of Europe always led to hardship," Kwasniewski said.
"Whenever there were attempts to divide Europe, be it for political
reasons, or religious or economic reasons, it resulted in wars and
conflicts. We have to draw a lesson from that. Europe, by its very
nature, because of its common roots, values and common legacy over 1,000
years of history, has to be treated in an integrated way."</TE>

<HD>Dialogue Urged in Kashmir Crisis</HD>
<DH>Asia: Powell, on visit, pushes for Pakistani- Indian talks and
praises Musharraf for reining in Islamic militants. He also stops in
Kabul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell launched a personal diplomatic
effort Wednesday to coax India and Pakistan back from the brink of war,
declaring that dialogue is the only way to resolve their standoff over
the disputed region of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference after meetings with President Pervez Musharraf
and other Pakistani leaders, Powell praised Musharraf for what he termed
"strong actions" to rein in militant Islamic groups that have used
Pakistani soil to launch terrorist attacks against India. He called on
both nuclear-armed countries to build on the actions to bring peace.</LD>
<LD>   "The important thing now is for both sides to make a political
judgment that the way out of this crisis is political and diplomatic and
not through conflict," Powell said. "We need a campaign against
terrorism, not a campaign with these two countries fighting one another."</LD>
<TE>   From Pakistan, Powell went to Kabul, Afghanistan, arriving this
morning at the presidential palace, where he and interim Prime Minister
Hamid Karzai discussed everything from Afghanistan's security to an
upcoming Tokyo conference where prospective donor nations are to pledge
aid to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said the U.S. is working to free up Afghan accounts that were
frozen around the world after Sept. 11, and he expects some of the money
to be available in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, Powell's comments came against the backdrop of a massive
military buildup in Kashmir along the so-called Line of Control that
divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. The Himalayan region is
claimed by both countries.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will also travel to New Delhi for meetings with India's
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Militant Islamic groups have conducted a campaign of terror against
targets in Indian-controlled Kashmir for years, but a brazen assault on
India's Parliament last month stunned the country's leaders and sparked
the current standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between the two South Asian neighbors eased slightly earlier
this week after Musharraf, a general who came to power in a bloodless
1999 coup, distanced himself from Pakistani-based militant groups in a
major speech Saturday, then backed up his rhetoric by beginning a
crackdown against the most prominent of the groups.</TE>
<TE>   Although Powell praised Musharraf's anti-terrorist initiatives, the
reaction in New Delhi has been far more guarded. Indian leaders remain
highly skeptical about how serious the crackdown is and have rejected
calls for a pullback of India's military forces to peacetime positions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after a meeting of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
Cabinet committee on security Tuesday, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh appeared more cautious than negative, telling reporters that there
hadn't been "sufficient time to assess the situation" since Musharraf's
speech.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials reject India's skepticism, insisting that the
action against the militant groups is both serious and comprehensive.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday, Javed Iqbal Cheema, director general of
Pakistan's National Crisis Management Cell, which is coordinating the
government's move against militant groups, offered details of the
initiative. Cheema said that since the crackdown began last weekend,
about 2,000 people with ties to five banned militant organizations had
been taken into custody and about 1,000 offices used by these groups in
various parts of the country had been searched and sealed.</TE>
<TE>   He asserted that most key leaders were among those so far picked up.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the top leadership of all five groups, and the second tier is
also in," Cheema said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheema rejected Indian worries that the roundup is largely for show
and that those involved will quickly be released.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be investigated, interrogated and then tried under our
anti-terrorism law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   India, however, says it won't withdraw troops from its border with
Pakistan, or along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir, until it is
satisfied that "cross-border terrorism" is stopped. New Delhi is also
waiting for the extradition of 20 men it accuses of terrorism and
organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the two touchstones on the basis of which we will judge,"
Indian Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani said at a news conference in
New Delhi on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The extradition list includes Maulana Masood Azhar, head of
Jaish-e-Mohammed, which Musharraf banned Saturday. India accuses
Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba, another militant group, in the
Parliament attack, in which 14 people were killed, including the five
gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Azhar was reportedly detained by Pakistani authorities earlier this
week, but there has been no discussion of handing him over to India for
trial. Indian intelligence claims that in 1993, Azhar led a group of
militants to Somalia, where they allegedly participated in attacks on
U.S. troops. On Oct. 3 of that year, 18 U.S. soldiers died in a firefight
with Somali gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   After years of watching Pakistani governments either actively support
or tacitly tolerate militant Islamic groups engaged in terrorist
activities in Kashmir, many view India's wariness as understandable. But
there are several indications that appear to give credence to claims that
Pakistan's campaign is serious.</TE>
<TE>   Islamabad's declared intent to follow through with prosecutions and a
move earlier this week that prohibits the banned groups from re-forming
under another name are among those indications, diplomats and other
analysts say. They also note the recent creation of a National Kashmir
Committee under the leadership of a seasoned mainstream politician from
Pakistani-held Kashmir, Sardar Qayyum Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The establishing of the committee is seen as part of a shift in
Pakistani tactics on Kashmir aimed at strengthening the prospect for a
political dialogue with India.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts, however, claim that the biggest indicator of a
real shift lies in the stunning change in the region's political
landscape in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, they note, there was
a logic behind the government tolerating armed incursions into
Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir. It was good for Pakistan's ties with
the radical Islamic Taliban regime in Afghanistan, it got the Kashmir
issue onto the international agenda, and it polished Islamabad's
credentials in parts of the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the Taliban has collapsed, Kashmir is already on the
international agenda, and Pakistan has been embraced by the West because
of Musharraf's decision to back the United States' anti-terrorist
campaign. The goal of gaining control over all of Kashmir remains
unchanged, these analysts insist, but now the principal tool for
attaining that goal has changed from violence to political dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "It is in our mutual interest to step back and see that the best road
to the future is through the peaceful settlement of the disputes that
exist between us," Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdus Sattar told reporters
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Drops Voting System That Favored Muslims</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The military government scrapped an electoral system that
discriminated against religious minorities, announcing a major reform
Wednesday that frees non-Muslims to vote along with the Islamic majority.</LD>
<LD>   The government also dramatically increased the number of seats in the
National Assembly, the powerful lower house of parliament, to broaden
representation, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. It
quoted Tanwir Hussain, chairman of the National Reconstruction Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   In Pakistan, members of minority religions voted not for candidates in
their local districts but for a list of minority candidates. The
minorities were then given separate seats in the National Assembly in a
system that they said isolated them from the mainstream. In the past,
only 10 seats were reserved for religious minorities.</LD>
<TE>   The government also tripled, to 60, the number of seats reserved for
women.</TE>
<TE>   In the next elections, due in October, members of Pakistan's minority
religions, including Hindus and Christians, will have voting rights
identical to those of Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's 140 million population is about 97% Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   The split system had been introduced by late military ruler Gen. Zia
ul-Haq in the 1980s.</TE>

<HD>Russia, U.S. Arms Talks End on Chill</HD>
<DH>Military: The sides agree to seek cooperation in some areas, but
America's plan to store warheads has them at odds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A new round of U.S.-Russian military talks adjourned Wednesday with
U.S. officials voicing hope for an eventual deal but Russians clearly
concerned that the Americans may be unwilling to commit themselves to
lasting nuclear arms reductions.</LD>
<LD>   In a Pentagon news conference closing two days of meetings,
Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith said the two sides agreed to
set up committees to improve cooperation on arms reduction,
nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, missile defense and other issues.</LD>
<LD>   But Russian Col. Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, the head of the Russian
delegation, made clear that Russia is concerned about American plans to
store rather than destroy thousands of nuclear warheads that the U.S. has
said it will take out of commission. He said Russians want the U.S. to
commit itself in writing to a deal that is "irreversible."</LD>
<TE>   Since the 2000 presidential campaign, President Bush, and later his
administration, has been promoting plans to radically reshape the
U.S.-Russian relationship so that it no longer revolves around highly
detailed nuclear arms treaties. Bush has announced unilateral plans to
pare the U.S. nuclear arsenal from about 7,000 deployed warheads to
between 1,700 and 2,200 over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials hope to draft new military arrangements that could
receive a final official blessing when Bush meets with President Vladimir
V. Putin in Russia this spring.</TE>
<TE>   But it has become clear in recent days that the Pentagon wants to
retain the flexibility to quickly rebuild its forces--including the
offensive nuclear arsenal--if a new threat develops.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russian officials have been pressing the Americans to commit
themselves to a binding treaty, U.S. officials have signaled that they
would favor more informal agreements, perhaps joint communiques.</TE>
<TE>   As Russians have voiced their unhappiness over arms issues, other
strains have appeared in the relationship. U.S. officials have expressed
concern over human rights issues in the separatist republic of Chechnya
and the fate of Russia's independent news media.</TE>
<TE>   Baluyevsky said Russia believes that the U.S. decision to withdraw
from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty was a "mistake" that had
affected the atmosphere for the talks.</TE>
<TE>   In Moscow on Wednesday, the lower house of Russia's parliament voted
326-3 for a resolution condemning the U.S. withdrawal. The U.S. move was
"destabilizing, since it in effect ruins the existing highly efficient
system of ensuring strategic stability and paves ground for a new round
of the arms race," said the State Duma's resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration believes that the treaty, which limited each
nation's ability to shoot down incoming missiles, held back American
efforts to develop important defenses against attack by "rogue" nations.
But Russians believed that the treaty was a cornerstone of strategic
stability.</TE>
<TE>   Baluyevsky said the participants in the current talks did not intend
to "make a tragedy" of the U.S. action, but are "working very hard to
look for a mutual ground on which we can keep working in the future."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Russian view was that the arms documents should provide
"equal security for both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Feith did not rule out the use of arms treaties, saying the United
States was "completely open-minded on the subject." He said the United
States had used a wide range of agreements over the years, from formal
treaties to simple memorandums of understanding.</TE>
<TE>   The United States intended to provide the Russians "predictability and
transparency" in the agreement to reduce the offensive nuclear arsenals,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Feith also sought to rebut criticism that the planned arms deal did
not go far enough because the warheads would not be destroyed but only
put in storage. He said several past arms control deals did not require
destruction of warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Collina, an arms control advocate with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, agreed that some Cold War-era treaties did not require
destruction of warheads. But he said those treaties typically sought to
limit nuclear strength by setting limits on the number of "launchers,"
such as land- or sea-based missiles.</TE>

<HD>Debris Blamed for Concorde Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>A final government report on the crash of an Air France Concorde
confirmed the long-held theory that a piece of debris from a Continental
Airlines plane was a factor in the accident that killed 113.</LD>
<LD>   The 400-page report by France's Accident Investigation Bureau,
released Wednesday, says that the July 25, 2000, crash could not have
been foreseen, but it also cites what it says are sloppy operations by
Air France and Continental.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Continental on Wednesday denied any suggestion that it
was responsible for the crash.</LD>
<TE>   The report said that a Continental DC-10 shed a piece of metal onto a
runway that the Concorde used for takeoff. The strip caused a Concorde
tire to burst, propelling rubber debris into the fuel tanks, causing a
fuel leak and a fire. The report blamed the loss of the metal piece on "a
lack of rigorous maintenance."</TE>

<HD>Bush Pledges to Help in Argentine Crisis</HD>
<DH>Policies: Buenos Aires must first adopt solid economic plan,
president says. He also urges free-trade pact with five Central American
nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Wednesday said the United States will help
Argentina survive its financial crisis, but only if the new leaders in
Buenos Aires adopt a "sound and sustainable" economic strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush also said the administration is interested in negotiating a
free-trade agreement with five Central American countries, a process that
could produce results even if broader trade talks fail.</LD>
<LD>   In his most extensive remarks yet on Argentina's troubles, Bush
pledged U.S. assistance in efforts to help the government of President
Eduardo Duhalde restructure the country's economy and renegotiate its
debts. Duhalde took office Jan. 2.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States is prepared to help Argentina weather this storm,"
Bush declared in a speech to the World Affairs Council. He added: "Once
Argentina has committed to a sound and sustainable economic plan, we will
support assistance for Argentina through international financial
institutions."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called on the nations of the Western Hemisphere to
"strengthen our commitment to market-based reform, not weaken it."</TE>
<TE>   "Shortcuts to reform only lead to more trouble," Bush said.
"Half-measures will not halve the pain, only prolong it."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing efforts to reach a Central American trade pact, Bush
signaled that the administration is determined to push for expanded trade
on multiple fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed agreement would include Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador,
Costa Rica and Nicaragua, which together have about 34 million citizens
and account for $9 billion in U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, the talks would in effect expand the North American
Free Trade Agreement, even if separate negotiations to create a
hemispheric free-trade area are derailed by Argentina's economic crisis
or other countries' reluctance to sign up. NAFTA eliminates tariffs and
other impediments to trade among Canada, Mexico and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I announce the United States will explore a free-trade
agreement with the countries of Central America," Bush said. "Our purpose
is to strengthen the economic ties we already have with these nations, to
reinforce their progress toward economic and political and social reform
and take another step toward completing the Free Trade Area of the
Americas."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. already is negotiating a free-trade agreement with Chile and
has helped launch a new round of global trade talks under the auspices of
the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Clyde Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, said Bush was sending a strong message to
"foot-draggers" such as Brazil, which has not been eager to enter into a
hemispheric pact. "It's a bold move," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Officials Indict Shoe-Bomb Suspect</HD>
<DH>Courts: Government accuses Richard C. Reid of being trained as an
Al Qaeda terrorist. He faces life in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Escalating their courtroom offensive against suspected terrorists,
authorities brought nine criminal counts Wednesday against alleged shoe
bomber Richard C. Reid, alleging that he was an Al Qaeda-trained
operative who plotted to blow a Miami-bound flight out of the sky last
month.</LD>
<LD>   Reid was overwhelmed by passengers and flight attendants aboard
American Airlines Flight 63 after he was seen trying to light a wire in
his shoe. He faces life in prison if he is convicted of attempted murder,
use of a weapon of mass destruction, explosives charges or other
offenses.</LD>
<LD>   Reid, a 28-year-old British drifter, has been held since his arrest on
charges of interfering with the flight crew of the Paris-to-Miami flight
Dec. 22. But he now faces a far more serious litany of allegations after
Wednesday's grand jury indictment in Boston, where the flight was
diverted.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment marks the first time that prosecutors have used a new
measure growing out of last year's "Patriot Act" anti-terrorism
legislation, levying stiffer penalties for attacks on mass transportation
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Reid also reflect a shift in federal
anti-terrorist strategy from terrorism prevention to a new phase of
criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, federal officials said their top priority would
be to stop future assaults at all costs, even if it meant holding off on
gathering evidence for criminal prosecutions. Investigators probed
intelligence leads, rounded up hundreds of possible suspects and held
them on non-terrorism charges and put new security measures in place to
head off the prospect of another round of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still very wary of future attacks, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said Wednesday. But more recently, with the investigation into
Al Qaeda moving largely overseas, U.S. authorities have shifted their
focus to criminal prosecutions and have brought charges against suspected
"20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui, American Taliban John Walker Lindh
and now Reid.</TE>
<TE>   But some defense lawyers say authorities may be moving too
aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   Tamar R. Birckhead, an assistant federal public defender in Boston
representing Reid, expressed dismay that word of the defendant's pending
indictment had been leaked to the news media. She urged authorities to
conduct their prosecution "with fairness and evenhandedness" and respect
Reid's presumption of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney also noted that the indictment against Reid does
not allege that he was acting on behalf of Al Qaeda or any other
terrorism organization in the bombing attempt. "We are aware of no basis
for such an allegation," Birckhead said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Ashcroft refused to say Wednesday whether he believed Reid was
acting alone or at the behest of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. The
indictment alleges that "at various times . . . Reid received training
from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan," but authorities refused to provide any
details about the extent of that training.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft also said authorities were investigating whether Reid may
have been a roving scout for another round of overseas attacks by Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal, in a report Wednesday, said that internal Al
Qaeda memos referred to an operative code-named "brother Abdul Ra'uff,"
whose travels to Amsterdam, Tel Aviv, Turkey and Pakistan last summer
bore a striking similarity to Reid's movements during the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Both men acquired new British passports at the British consulate in
Amsterdam, bought plane tickets to Israel on the day of their departure
and were questioned at length by suspicious Israeli authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In the computer files, which were password-encoded, men identified by
the Journal as top Al Qaeda operatives said Abdul Ra'uff debriefed them
on potentially good targets within Israel and Egypt to smuggle in
explosives and kill hundreds of people.</TE>
<TE>   The memos were obtained by the Journal after one of its reporters
purchased two computer hard drives from an Afghanistan computer merchant,
who obtained them from a looter. The computers apparently were used by
top Al Qaeda officials, but did not identify Abdul Ra'uff or mention
Reid, the Journal reported, saying it passed the information along to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft commended the Wall Street Journal for acting "responsibly" by
turning the information over to authorities to aid in the terrorism
probe.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft also praised the passengers and crew of Flight 63 for
thwarting the alleged plot. FBI officials said they found a highly
volatile mix of sophisticated explosives in Reid's shoe that could have
blown a hole in the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "But for the vigilance of the flight crew and the courage of the
passengers on Flight 63, Richard Reid may have succeeded in what today's
indictment charges was his ultimate goal--the destruction of Flight 63
and the 197 people on board," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft noted that some people mocked the nationwide alerts the
government issued this fall, urging people to watch for suspicious
activities. "Certainly if we'd have put out an alert saying, 'Watch out
for people with exploding shoes,' we would have been laughed out of town.
But I think people [on Reid's flight] were alert," and that thwarted the
plot, Ashcroft said.</TE>

<HD>Case Is Dropped Over Hotel Radio</HD>
<DH>Courts: Another Sept. 11 guest says the aviation transceiver
belonged to him and not the Egyptian student who was charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors late Wednesday dropped all charges against an
Egyptian graduate student accused of lying to investigators about
possessing an aviation radio in a hotel overlooking the World Trade
Center the day terrorists attacked.</LD>
<LD>   A letter filed by the government in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
said a private pilot had come forward to say the radio belonged to him,
and the claim was legitimate.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Abdallah Higazy, 30, a graduate student in computer science
at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, was ordered held without bail by
U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.</LD>
<TE>   A government complaint charged that the radio was found in the safe of
the room Higazy occupied Sept. 11. He denied ownership of the
transceiver, capable of air-to-ground communications.</TE>
<TE>   After the private pilot who stayed at the same hotel claimed the radio
Monday, FBI agents reinterviewed the security agent at the Millennium
Hilton Hotel who said he discovered the radio in the safe in the room
Higazy had occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy and other guests were ordered out of the hotel soon after the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel security agent's recollection changed, prosecutors said. He
remembered finding the radio on a table, not in the safe that he had
opened with a special key in Higazy's room in October.</TE>
<TE>   The security officer was conducting an inventory of property that
guests had left behind when they quickly left the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The letter to the court Wednesday said the pilot's room was one floor
below the room Higazy occupied. The document requested Higazy's immediate
release.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner of the aviation radio had no interaction with Mr. Higazy,"
the letter said. "It is still unclear, therefore, how the radio was
transferred from the room on the 50th floor to Mr. Higazy's room on the
51st floor."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom after Higazy was held without bail, the defense
lawyer said anything could have happened in the months after the hotel
was evacuated.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Seeks Pullout of U.S. Forces From Sinai</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Demands of terror war lend new urgency to cutting back on
peacekeeping commitments, Defense secretary says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Citing the demands of the war on terrorism as justification for
cutting back on U.S. peacekeeping missions, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld stepped up his campaign Wednesday to withdraw American troops
from a multinational force that has been patrolling the Sinai Peninsula
for two decades.</LD>
<LD>   "I do not believe that we still need our forces in the Sinai. I just
plain don't," Rumsfeld said. "And we're working carefully with our
friends and allies in Israel and Egypt to see if there isn't some
reasonable way that . . . we can modestly reduce some of those folks that
are down there in the Sinai."</LD>
<LD>   About 900 U.S. troops make up the bulk of an 11-nation peacekeeping
force on the Sinai Peninsula. The force patrols and operates checkpoints
and observation posts within the demilitarized zone that runs along the
boundary between Egypt and Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld made a similar proposal during a visit to Israel in April,
dismaying Israelis and some Bush administration officials. The timing of
his latest remarks, with Israeli-Arab relations at a particularly low
ebb, prompted criticism.</TE>
<TE>   A senior official at the National Security Council said the White
House and the State Department had not been informed that Rumsfeld was
going to make the remarks. And one former NSC official, Geoffrey Kemp,
called the U.S. presence in the Sinai "terribly important."</TE>
<TE>   "In the long run it's fair to ask, 'How much longer should we keep
them in the Sinai?' But to bring it up now? It surprises me," said Kemp,
now a senior fellow at the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom in
Washington. "It seems so obvious that a time of crisis in the Middle East
is not the time to start withdrawing forces that play a very important
symbolic role in keeping the peace between Egypt and Israel."</TE>
<TE>   But Rumsfeld told reporters that the war on terrorism lends new
urgency to cutting back on long-standing commitments in the Sinai,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't plan to go in and spend a career or a lifetime or two
generations in these places," Rumsfeld said. "We want to be helpful where
we can. We can contribute to peace and stability. We are an important
country in an important time in the world, and we ought to do that. But I
do think we ought to do it with our eyes wide open, and we ought to do it
in a measured way, and we ought not to do it excessively."</TE>
<TE>   The call by Rumsfeld came as the Pentagon moved to step up the U.S.
military presence in the Philippines to train, equip and advise troops
from that country in their fight against Muslim guerrillas linked to
Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   About 250 U.S. troops have arrived in the Philippines since October to
help that country's fight against the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Over
the next few months, the number of troops deployed there will increase to
650, their mission being to accompany Philippine patrols on Basilan, a
rugged island that is an Abu Sayyaf stronghold, a Defense Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   A shipment of weapons from the U.S., including automatic rifles and
grenade launchers, arrived in the Philippines in recent days, the defense
official said. More weapons and equipment are on the way, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have been holding a U.S. couple and a
Philippine nurse hostage on Basilan since last spring, adding to the
Pentagon's resolve to go after the terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has also been quietly creating a ring of military bases
encircling Afghanistan and is working with intelligence agents in
countries where the Al Qaeda network is believed to have footholds. In
countries from Bulgaria to Turkey, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and beyond,
more than 60,000 U.S. military personnel now live and work at the new
bases, according to Pentagon officials.</TE>
<TE>   Those new troop deployments, combined with the Pentagon's expanded
role in patrolling U.S. skies and coastlines, have Rumsfeld and his top
aides concerned that the military could find itself stretched too thin.</TE>
<TE>   "It suggests to me, as an interested observer concerned about the men
and women in the armed services, [that] . . . we ought not to impose
excessively on them, such that the wear and tear on the force is
excessive," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has long advocated spending more on high-technology weapons
and on the development of a national missile defense system, and less on
deployment of troops for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, such as
in the Balkans and Haiti. He has said such deployments dull America's
fighting edge and force battle-ready troops into jobs they aren't trained
for.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Rumsfeld angered some North Atlantic Treaty Organization
ministers when he proposed cutting as many as 6,000 troops from a Bosnian
peacekeeping mission he described as straining the U.S. ability to carry
out the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most important roles that U.S. forces play around the
world is in preserving stability and deterring aggression," said Kenneth
M. Pollack, deputy director for national security studies at the Council
on Foreign Relations. "Just because we're going after terrorists now
doesn't mean that we should give up that mission."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Wednesday, a third planeload of prisoners from the Afghan
war arrived at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, bringing to 80 the
number of detainees at a makeshift prison there.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, a man describing himself as a top Al Qaeda financier
was being interrogated after he presented himself to U.S. troops at the
airport in the southern city of Kandahar. Few details were available
about the alleged financier. Rumsfeld said the man was being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, authorities reopened Kabul International Airport, with
mostly foreign troops having patched the bomb-cratered runways. Ariana,
the Afghan national airline, has just two small passenger planes, and the
airfield serving the Afghan capital is expected to be used primarily by
military and humanitarian aid aircraft in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most significant moves of the country's fledgling
government, interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai on Wednesday banned the
cultivation, production, processing, smuggling and trafficking of opium,
among Afghanistan's most lucrative exports.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear how the ban will be enforced. Under the former Taliban
regime, opium also was outlawed and production plummeted. But with
poverty and little economic alternative, many farmers have planted their
fields with poppies since the Taliban was overthrown late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan remains one of the world's biggest suppliers of opium and
its derivatives morphine and heroin: Just last week, Pakistani
authorities intercepted a caravan of trucks transporting more than 1,400
pounds of pure heroin.</TE>

<HD>Hart Senate Office Building, Declared Free of Anthrax, to Open
Friday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Officials pronounced the Hart Senate Office Building free of
anthrax on Wednesday, and maintenance crews began preparing it for a
Friday reopening, three months after a letter laden with the deadly
bacteria was opened there.</LD>
<LD>   In a pair of memos e-mailed to senators, health and environmental
officials said repeated efforts to cleanse the building had "achieved the
goal of eliminating viable anthrax spores."</LD>
<LD>   "It is clean and safe . . . for rehabilitation and reoccupancy," said
the memo, citing the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, there were mixed reactions among workers about returning to
the building where a letter believed to contain billions of anthrax
spores was opened Oct. 15 in the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   The letter--which contained a threatening note--came as anthrax was
detected in dozens of locations around Washington, New York and
elsewhere, causing five fatalities and a national focus on bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-story Hart building, which houses the offices of half the 100
senators, has been closed since Oct. 17.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what will happen. You still don't have the confidence
to say it's safe," said Francis Shaw, a congressional maintenance worker
who with others spent the morning installing new carpeting in the
building.</TE>
<TE>   The group wore no protective gear after being told none was needed.</TE>
<TE>   The workers said supervisors announced that anyone uncomfortable about
entering the Hart building would not be forced to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Others expressed relief about returning to their workplaces. Senators'
staffs normally assigned to Hart have been dispersed among the Capitol
and other Senate office buildings, private work space, district offices
and their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is very happy to get back to our regular office and our
regular working conditions," said Dave Lemmon, spokesman for Sen. Debbie
Stabenow (D-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol Police also said a handful of anthrax-tainted offices in
the Longworth and Ford House office buildings had been declared safe.
Those offices were scheduled to reopen next Tuesday. The bulk of the
Longworth and Ford buildings reopened in November.</TE>
<TE>   In the initial days after the Daschle letter was opened, officials
said the Hart building could be cleaned up and reoccupied by
mid-November.</TE>

<HD>Charges Listed Against 90 Held in Terror Sweep</HD>
<DH>Dragnet: Officials release names after criticism over secrecy. Only
one, suspected '20th hijacker' Zacarias Moussaoui, is tied to Sept. 11
attacks.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>More than 90 people who were swept up in the terrorism
investigation have been charged with crimes not related to the Sept. 11
attacks, law enforcement officials have disclosed in their most complete
accounting to date of the terrorist probe in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   After months of being criticized for secrecy, law enforcement
officials released documents showing that the 92 people had been charged
as of last week with a wide array of federal crimes, but only
one--Zacarias Moussaoui, suspected of being the "20th hijacker"--has been
linked in court to Sept. 11, when hijacked planes leveled the World Trade
Center's twin towers, slammed into the Pentagon and crashed in rural
Pennsylvania. The documents also suggest that 25 others are being held on
material witness warrants or other undisclosed offenses related to
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>Intense Probe Led to Many Arrests</TE>
<TE>   The list, which offers details about who has been charged around the
country and the types of cases that are being presented, also makes clear
that most of the suspects never would have been apprehended had there not
been such an intense investigation after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested, most of them immigrants from the Middle East, were
taken into custody by FBI agents as the bureau fanned out to gather
information about other potential terrorists. The crimes ranged from bank
fraud and making false identification cards and passports, to weapon
charges and lying to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the defendants already have pleaded guilty, have been
sentenced and, in some cases, have been deported to their home countries.
Four of the defendants are from California.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and the Department of Justice have been especially
tight-lipped about the nature of their investigation and its
repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   But officials released the detailed list Friday in response to a
lawsuit filed by a coalition of civil liberties groups that are seeking a
full picture of the scope of the investigation.</TE>
<TE>'An Unprecedented Worldwide Effort'</TE>
<TE>   "Four thousand FBI agents are engaged with their international
counterparts in an unprecedented worldwide effort to prevent further
attack by apprehending those responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and by
detecting, disrupting and dismantling terrorist organizations," said
James Reynolds, chief of the Justice Department's Terrorism and Violent
Crime Section in a declaration filed with the court.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an open and ongoing investigation; the FBI is continuing to
follow leads and conduct interviews at this time," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds said agents have questioned more than 1,000 people "about
whom concern had arisen," and that while most of those questioned were
released, other interviews "resulted in a decision to take individuals
into custody."</TE>
<TE>   He said 117 detainees were held on federal criminal charges, but the
list he provided included only 92 names.</TE>
<TE>   However, Reynolds noted that the others were "individuals who were
believed to have information material to the events of Sept. 11 [and]
were taken into custody under material witness warrants." Because of
grand jury secrecy, their names were not provided.</TE>
<TE>   A list of about 725 cases also was released, with the names blacked
out. Those detainees are suspected of immigration violations, according
to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   The 92 charged with federal crimes "remain a potential source of
relevant or probative information," Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not elaborate, he said that the release of too much
information about the defendants--such as where they are being
held--might "assist terrorist organizations in tracking the flow and
progress of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Moussaoui, four people have been charged since the list
was released Friday. They include two men who are accused of credit card
fraud; they once were considered prime terrorist suspects because they
were carrying box cutters when they were arrested Sept. 12 aboard an
Amtrak train.</TE>
<TE>   The two others--John Walker Lindh and Richard C. Reid--were charged
with having connections to the Al Qaeda terrorist network run by Osama
bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The cases have been brought in federal courts around the country.</TE>
<TE>   In Bangor, Maine, for instance, Francois Guagni, a French citizen who
earlier had been deported, is to be sentenced next week for trying to
illegally reenter the United States.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Christopher D. Smith, said Guagni had lived in Connecticut
for many years and was deported several years ago after committing
various crimes, such as domestic abuse and drinking while driving. Smith
said Guagni then attempted to return to the United States to visit his
family and was on a flight from France to New York on, of all days, Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>Picked Up Crossing Into Maine</TE>
<TE>   "His plane was diverted to Nova Scotia and he was going to take a bus
in from there to the Newark, N.J., and Connecticut area to see his
children," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Guagni was picked up trying to cross the border into Maine. "He did
not have permission to return because he had been deported," the lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said it was not surprising that authorities were concerned about
his client's movements because of the events that happened on the day he
sought to return to the U.S. But he said Guagni is not a terrorist, and
probably will be sentenced to a year or two on the illegal entry case.</TE>
<TE>   In a Pittsburgh case, Salam Ibrahim el Zaatari was charged with
attempting to board a plane Oct. 28 carrying a concealed "retractable
razor utility knife," much like those believed used by the 19 hijackers
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The 4- to 5-inch blade was in a plastic case in his carry-on luggage,
and El Zaatari told agents he had carried the instrument for months. He
said he was planning to go to Beirut to work on documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   A citizen of Lebanon, he was sentenced Dec. 12 to time served in jail
and was deported to Lebanon, U.S. Atty. Mary Beth Buchanan said.</TE>
<TE>   In Kansas City, Mo., Adel F. Badri pleaded guilty Jan. 8 to bank fraud
after being arrested on suspicion of forging three checks totaling
$10,750 on a Maryland bank account.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Whitley, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office there,
declined to say how Badri, a Saudi Arabian national, figured into the
Sept. 11 investigation, except to acknowledge that "it did come out in
open court that he had been interviewed by the FBI in regard to 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   In Phoenix, prosecutors have filed dozens of charges--ranging from
identity and financial fraud to falsifying a political asylum
application--against Malek Mohamed Seif, a pilot from Djibouti arrested
in October.</TE>
<TE>Links Found to Pentagon Pilot</TE>
<TE>   Seif has denied advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks, but
authorities have taken a special interest in him, partly because of his
world travels and acquaintance with the hijacker suspected of piloting
the plane into the Pentagon. Denied bail, he remains in the Maricopa
County jail awaiting a March trial.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four cases in California, two are from the San Jose area. They
involve Nabil Sarama--a Palestinian indicted Dec. 12 for making false
statements on immigration papers--and Azmy A. Elghazaly, indicted Oct. 24
on charges of being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm. Both
cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   The other California cases involve Mohdar Abdulla--held in San Diego
since his Sept. 23 arrest and charged with making false statements to
authorities--and Omer Salmain Saleh Bakarbashat, charged with fraud and
misusing immigration documents. They had lived or worked near some of the
hijackers.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Request a Doubling of Domestic Security Budget</HD>
<DH>Finances: Package of about $24 billion, part of a deficit spending
plan, is a fraction of the funding requests made by agencies, aide says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush will seek to double spending to protect America from
terrorism next year to at least $24 billion, his budget director said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But that request is only a tiny fraction of what federal agencies
sought in their zeal to advance projects under the banner of homeland
security.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and
Budget, told reporters he had received close to $300 billion worth of
terrorism-related spending requests after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Among them were calls to tighten security at the Bureau of Indian
Affairs--that "well-known terrorist target," Daniels cracked--and to make
"unspecified enhancements" to courthouse security across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Other agencies, Daniels said, were even more imaginative. "Creativity
blossomed all over town," Daniels said. "We literally were flooded."</TE>
<TE>   Some proposals are new, others repackaged. Congress has also pitched
in. Last year, Democratic lawmakers failed to win approval for spending
up to $20 billion more on homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   In that debate, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) cited the threat to the
Golden Gate Bridge in arguing for an additional $2.5 billion for highway
improvements and $2.1 billion for drinking water projects.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans attacked Byrd's position as another case of Democratic
spending proposals run amok. "War profiteering," Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) called it in a radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling debate on the administration's fiscal 2003 budget, to be
released on Feb. 4, is the government's first deficit since 1997. Daniels
confirmed that it would be "in the neighborhood" of $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In a year when many government programs will be scrutinized for
possible cuts, those that play a role in homeland security are emerging
as just about the only clear winners.</TE>
<TE>   Except for military spending and scattered other agencies and programs
such as the National Weather Service, federally sponsored science
research and certain aid to poor women and children, Daniels said, "the
rest of government will need to take second place."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also plans to propose $1.2 billion in new funding over three
years to reform voting systems across the country, administration
officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   As for what "homeland security" is, it's in the eye of the beholder.
Daniels' list included airport security, public health, protection
against bioterrorism, and aid to police and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   The term gained widespread use only a year ago in a report on 21st
century threats from a commission headed by former Sens. Gary Hart of
Colorado and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. It was given an official
stamp of approval in October when Bush issued an executive order creating
the first White House Office of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Bush put the director of that office, former Pennsylvania Gov. Thomas
J. Ridge, in charge of identifying which government functions are part of
homeland security. A Ridge aide said no information from that review was
yet available.</TE>
<TE>   Previous analyses suggest that much of the government could stake a
claim to a pool of money that has grown from $7.2 billion in 1998 to more
than $12 billion to combat terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and
other emerging threats. Daniels said Wednesday that the administration
would seek to roughly double that amount in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, OMB reported that more than 20 agencies outside the
Pentagon have missions linked to combating terrorism and other
"unconventional threats." While the list includes predictable names such
as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the departments of
Defense, Energy and Transportation, some other names are more surprising.</TE>
<TE>   The Agriculture Department gets roughly $50 million to, among other
things, protect the nation's food supply and conduct research on plant
and animal diseases. The Commerce Department, responsible for export
rules to keep sensitive technologies out of the hands of rogue nations,
gets a similar amount. Veterans Affairs gets $22 million to protect its
facilities, help with medical response to disasters and bolster
cyber-security. The Labor and Education departments get millions each to
protect "critical infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say it will take some time--maybe years--for the government to
sort out homeland security. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), a senior
member of the House Committee on Government Reform, predicted that the
funding bonanza would inevitably produce waste and duplication. But he
said that's not a bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have time to develop the perfect program," Shays said. "We
have to act. If we do anything important, we have to 'overdo' rather than
'underdo.' "</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, generally praising the administration's response to
terrorism, say they have been ahead of the curve on homeland security.
The total funding Bush is seeking is roughly in line with what senior
Democrats proposed last fall. Democrats backed off after Bush threatened
a veto, saying the new spending was premature.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, complained David Sirota, a spokesman for House
Appropriations Committee Democrats, new security measures could be
delayed until a new spending plan is enacted next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the administration forcing us to wait almost a year when we
know we need to do this stuff?" Sirota said. "The fear is that they are
turning the debate on homeland security into a debate on who gets
political credit."</TE>

<HD>Saudis Feel Unfairly Tarred With a Terrorist Brush</HD>
<DH>Mideast: They believe that U.S. policy, not the kingdom's
religion-based society, is to blame for fostering extremism that led to
the Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>Sheik Mohammed bin Jubeir sat comfortably on a silk-covered couch
in his gold-trimmed robe and reflected on the pain Saudi Arabia has
endured. Victim is the word he used. The oil-rich desert kingdom is a
victim.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like to assure you," Bin Jubeir said, "Saudi Arabia has been
a victim. No society in the world is a perfect society. There must be
negatives in each society."</LD>
<LD>   Bin Jubeir works behind great vaulted doors, in a room decorated with
gold trim, a crystal chandelier and a hand-woven Persian rug. He is the
chairman of the Consultative Council, the nation's appointed legislature.
But if Bin Jubeir's position puts him near the top of the power structure
here, his thoughts on victimization are as common as the country's love
of American fast food.</LD>
<TE>   Four months after the attacks that led the United States to declare
war on terrorism, the people of this capital--college students, members
of the military, businesspeople, minority groups, academics--are united
in their belief that the American media and people have unfairly and
incorrectly lashed out at Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Across this capital, there is a consensus that Americans have blamed
this nation of 22 million people for fostering terrorists when, Saudis
believe, it is U.S. support for Israel that is to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we are suffering from a lack of knowledge--or there is an
intentional effort of deforming the facts," said Abdelaziz bin Salman, a
former ambassador to UNESCO. "How can you explain to an average citizen
this blind support for a criminal like [Israeli Prime Minister] Ariel
Sharon? This is not understandable to us."</TE>
<TE>   At the highest levels of government, there is an acceptance that as
many as 15 of the Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi nationals. And
officially, the government says it has no doubt that Osama bin Laden was
behind the attacks. But those sentiments remain tempered for many people
here, like Bin Jubeir, who argue that the U.S. has provided no proof on
the identity of the hijackers or the Saudi militant's involvement.</TE>
<TE>Some Doubt Evidence Against Bin Laden</TE>
<TE>   In a country that stripped Bin Laden of his citizenship in 1994, there
are still some, like one military officer, who wonder whether "Hollywood
produced" the video in which Bin Laden suggests that he had advance
knowledge of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nothing to show from the United States," Bin Jubeir said
regarding the identity of the hijackers. "All we hear from the U.S. are
accusations. No proof."</TE>
<TE>   And regarding Bin Laden, he said: "Through what has been published and
through the satellite channels, we could think that Bin Laden was
responsible. But there is nothing definite."</TE>
<TE>   After the September attacks and the discovery that Saudi nationals
were involved, there was a sense among many Americans that the kingdom
was double-dealing: serving as a U.S. ally in its campaign against Iraq
while churning out and supporting an army of religious extremists who are
the backbone of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network. Though the Saudi
government says it did not give money to the Taliban in Afghanistan,
wealthy Saudis are believed to have contributed to Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   But as many Americans have been reluctant to publicly reevaluate their
own foreign policy actions in the context of Sept. 11, not wanting to
appear to reward terrorism by addressing its demands, Saudis have been
reluctant to look anew at their own society in the context of the
American scrutiny. Sure, there are social, economic and political
problems here, they say. But there is no way the Saudi regime or citizens
are going to agree that their religion-based system is somehow at fault.</TE>
<TE>   Although it might sound outlandish to Americans, the feelings here
four months after the attacks are as raw as in the United States. It is
as though the doors were blown open on a family squabble and those inside
are still shocked at what the neighbors are saying about what they saw.
The events of Sept. 11 have forced a degree of introspection and
soul-searching on this society--but only, it seems, at the highest level
of government, or perhaps in quiet moments for individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "When I am by myself, I ask myself, why do I hate Israel? I know it is
because they taught me in the schools to hate Israel," said a
professional who, like many people here, asked not to be identified for
fear of retribution from the government or religious authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The government, for its part, reviewed its school curriculum to see if
it is, as some Americans have charged, promoting intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "We examined our curriculum because people thought in our curriculum
we were creating a residue of hate," said a businessman with close ties
to the government. "We found to the contrary, that our curriculum is like
any other country."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "We further dug in, and we found teachers who might
have expanded on teaching their hostility and frustration against
policies vis-a-vis the Palestinian issue. This, of course, resulted in
some kind of anger transferred to the students."</TE>
<TE>   But this allowance, no matter how minor, that Saudi society might bear
even a fraction of responsibility, is the exception.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Saudi Arabia are not enemies of the United States. We
have had a close relationship for 70 years," said Prince Turki al Faisal,
former head of Saudi intelligence. "Who put us in this difficult
position? America, because of its duplicity to the Arab world and because
of its relationship with Israel. I don't see how we bear any
responsibility except that we are reticent in what we say. We have always
looked to America as a friend of Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   King Saud University is a sprawling city campus with carpeted
hallways, air-conditioned rooms and a theater. Fahad Kheraiji is a
professor of communications and, like many of his colleagues, studied in
the U.S. He views himself as someone who understands Americans. But
still, he says, he cannot understand what he sees as a backlash against
Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "Until today, we felt this relationship was strong," he said. "But
after Sept. 11, people here were shocked, really shocked at the media
attack. They were really unhappy with the treatment."</TE>
<TE>U.S.-Saudi Relationship Established in 1930s</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi-American relationship dates to the 1930s, when Standard Oil
of California was granted a concession. That grew into the Arabian
American Oil Co., a Saudi institution that for decades brought thousands
of U.S. oil workers to this nation.</TE>
<TE>   But the relationship has been mostly government to government, each
having a vested interest in the other country. Saudi Arabia sits on
one-quarter of the world's known oil reserves and with a small population
is vulnerable to aggressive neighbors such as Iraq. The U.S. helps
maintain the status quo. At the same time, American administrations have
relied on the Saudis to maintain a reasonable price for oil and to
contain communist and Pan-Arab movements.</TE>
<TE>   But people to people, the populations could not be much different.
Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to the two holiest sites
for Muslims. While Americans have long tried to make their religion
accommodate modern life, Saudis struggle to make modern life accommodate
their religion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different world here," a Western diplomat said. "It is an
extremely important and close relationship to both countries. Sept. 11
put the focus on that relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks also revealed a contradiction in the Saudi psyche. The
people compartmentalize their feelings for the West. In one space, they
hold their admiration for American culture, products and services; in the
other, their contempt for American support of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   When the World Trade Center towers came down, people here thought that
perhaps the U.S. would begin reevaluating its support for the Jewish
state. But that didn't happen. Instead relations with Saudi Arabia, at
some levels, have come under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "All Saudis like Americans," said Abdelaziz, a businessman who
requested that his full name not be used. "But as Arabs we do not like
the American government. We believe it is controlled by the Zionists. The
government works to destroy the Arabs. Is it true? I don't know; it is
what we believe."</TE>

<HD>Detainees 'Trained by Al Qaeda'</HD>
<DH>Asia: Malaysian leader also links the suspected militants to the
Taliban in Afghanistan. Officials are probing reports of bomb-making
material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SERDANG, Malaysia
</DL>
<LD>Members of a group of suspected Islamic militants arrested in
Malaysia were trained in Afghanistan by Al Qaeda and Taliban forces,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mahathir said police also were investigating whether a large cache of
bomb-making material allegedly hidden in Malaysia by Islamic militants
from Singapore was still in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Malaysian officials announced last week that they had arrested 13
people since Dec. 9 who they allege are members of an Islamic militant
group with links to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities in neighboring Singapore have arrested 15 people suspected
of Al Qaeda ties who allegedly were planning to blow up the U.S. Embassy
and attack high-profile Americans in Singapore. Malaysian officials have
said the Malaysian and Singaporean groups may be linked.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Wednesday about the ties of the Malaysian detainees to Al Qaeda,
Mahathir told reporters: "I am informed that they were trained by the
same people--they were trained in Afghanistan by the Taliban as well as
the Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he was uncertain whether the alleged militants were
directly connected to those involved in the Sept. 11 terror attacks in
the United States. "We don't know, unless of course you consider training
in the same place as being linked," Mahathir said.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday
that the Singaporean terror suspects had brought tons of bomb-making
material--particularly ammonium nitrate--into Malaysia. He said that the
material had since been removed but that authorities did not know the
current location.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Mahathir said Malaysian authorities were still
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to find out [about] these allegations that there are
explosives, huge amounts of explosives, in Malaysia," Mahathir said. "But
we haven't enough information for us to detect or to locate the
position."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the militants may be part of a network of Islamic cells
operating in several Southeast Asian nations and plotting attacks.</TE>

<HD>Algerian Gets Prison in LAX Bomb Plot</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Support of a millennium attack plan, thwarted in an
arrest at the Canadian border, draws a 24-year term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge, declaring that an Algerian man "created a grave
risk to the safety and well being of the American people," sentenced him
Wednesday to 24 years in prison for supporting a plot to bomb Los Angeles
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   After stating, "No. I don't say anything," Mokhtar Haouari, 33, stood
impassively while Judge John F. Keenan told him in a soft but stern voice
that he must be punished severely "or else the law becomes a mockery and
government becomes prey to the forces of evil and destruction."</LD>
<LD>   In July, a jury found Haouari guilty of providing logistical support
to two cohorts in the plot, whose leader, Ahmed Ressam, was captured in
December 1999 at the border between the United States and Canada with a
car containing explosives and timing devices in its trunk.</LD>
<TE>   Ressam, who received training at two terrorist camps in Afghanistan
from about March 1998 to February 1999, was convicted in Los Angeles and
later testified against Haouari at the trial in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam admitted he was a member of a cell, based in Canada, that
intended to launch a terrorist attack before the millennium.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, the jury heard testimony that Haouari, a Montreal
shopkeeper, helped Ressam by giving him $3,000 in Canadian money and a
bogus Quebec driver's license in another person's name.</TE>
<TE>   He also agreed to provide a fake Canadian passport for Ressam to use
after the suitcase bomb attack to escape to Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam told the court during the trial that he revealed to Haouari
that he was traveling to Los Angeles to do "a job" and that Haouari
comprehended the meaning of the statement.</TE>
<TE>   He related that Haouari pledged to support the plan with money and
other aid.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant played an important part in what could have been a
terrible tragedy," Asst. U.S. Atty. Robin Baker told the jury, which
deliberated for two days before finding Haouari guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Also testifying for the government was Abdelghani Meskini, whom
Haouari asked to travel from his home in Brooklyn to Seattle to help
Ressam by providing him with additional funds and a cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   Meskini agreed and went to Seattle, but his trip was fruitless. Ressam
never arrived because he was arrested at the border.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence at the trial also showed that Haouari provided Meskini with
bogus Canadian drivers' licenses and passports and that Meskini used the
documents to commit credit card and bank fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Meskini pleaded guilty on March 7 to charges including fraud and
conspiring to provide support to Ressam's planned terrorism. He has not
been sentenced yet.</TE>
<TE>   During the brief sentencing procedure on Wednesday, Haouari wearing
blue prison clothing, sat casually with his left arm draped over the back
of his chair while his lawyer, Daniel Ollen, asked Keenan to "temper
justice with compassion."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Haouari either knew or consciously avoided details of Mr.
Ressam's plan to blow up the Los Angeles airport," Keenan said before
imposing the sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The judge told Haouari that his activity was "reprehensible."</TE>
<TE>   After his conviction in Los Angeles on April 6 on charges related to
terrorism, transporting explosives and lying to government officials,
Ressam agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He has not been sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, 2002, another defendant, Samir Ait Mohamed, was indicted
in the case. Prosecutors alleged he also helped Ressam and committed
credit card fraud. He is being held by authorities in Vancouver, Canada,
pending extradition to the United States.</TE>

<HD>French Arrest 2 in Afghan Slaying Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>French police have arrested two men on suspicion of providing
support to the assassins of Afghan resistance leader Ahmed Shah Masoud,
judicial officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests are part of an intensive manhunt for those responsible for
killing Masoud just days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
United States. The suicide attackers apparently posed as journalists and
detonated a rigged TV camera, mortally wounding Masoud.</LD>
<LD>   The two men were taken into custody Monday and identified as
Abderammane Ameuroude, a 24-year-old Algerian, and Mehrez Azouz, a
Frenchman of Tunisian descent. Officials said intelligence agents also
seized a significant amount of evidence from the men's apartment.</LD>
<TE>   The two were arrested on a warrant from Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere.
Since early November, Bruguiere has been seeking out members of a support
network that may have provided false documents to the assassins of
Masoud, the charismatic Northern Alliance leader known as "the Lion of
Panjshir."</TE>
<TE>   Bruguiere has also placed Youssef el Aouni and Adel Tebourski, both
Frenchmen of North African descent, under investigation for "association
with criminals in relation with a terrorist enterprise" and falsification
of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Both men had been arrested at the request of Belgian officials, who
suspected them of forging passports. Masoud's killers carried Belgian
passports.</TE>
<TE>   Several others were detained in France and Belgium in November on
suspicion of organizing the attack on Masoud.</TE>

<HD>Dean, Professor and Student Killed at Law School in Va.</HD>
<DH>Crime: Students tackle the gunman minutes after the shootings. The
suspect, a student, is a Nigerian immigrant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>GRUNDY, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A student apparently irate over failing grades burst into the
dean's office with a semiautomatic pistol and killed the dean, a
professor and then another student Wednesday at a small private law
school amid the coal fields of Appalachia, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Other students tackled the gunman minutes after he stalked through the
tiny campus of the Appalachian School of Law where he wounded three
others during the shooting spree.</LD>
<LD>   State police said they were holding Peter Odighizuwa, a 43-year-old
Nigerian immigrant, as the suspected gunman. He had been dismissed from
the law school earlier Wednesday; other students said it was the second
time that he had failed first-year classes.</LD>
<TE>   "Pray for me," Odighizuwa said to a professor right before he started
shooting, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   They described Odighizuwa as a loner, a Nigerian immigrant who spoke
with such a strong accent that it was difficult for them to understand
him.</TE>
<TE>   Odighizuwa allegedly shot dean L. Anthony Sutin and professor Thomas
Blackwell in their offices, then opened fire, emptying two magazines of
.380 bullets in a student lounge, where his classmates were gathered over
lunch.</TE>
<TE>   The third fatality was identified as Angela Dales, 33, a former
recruiter for the law school who had enrolled as a student last semester.</TE>
<TE>   "The dean and the professor were executed . . . at point-blank range,"
said Dr. Jack Briggs, the county medical examiner. "The dean had a white
shirt on, and you can see the two bullet holes in his back. You could see
the powder burns."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the wounded students were shot in the back, apparently as they
attempted to flee the lounge, Briggs said. "It looked like a war zone,"
he said. All the wounded were airlifted to hospitals in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Students who responded to the sound of the gunshots described a
nightmarish scene in the lounge--and what seemed an interminable wait
before police and paramedics arrived. Using folding coffee tables as
makeshift stretchers, several students bundled the wounded into cars and
drove them to the local hospital. Two other students, both former police
officers, took control of the room and tried to maintain the integrity of
the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a huge puddle of blood [around one victim] and a trail of
blood across the floor," said first-year student Eric Creed, who helped
organize the stretcher brigade. "We were just shocked. Everyone is so
shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Odighizuwa was described as a foul-tempered student who would talk
back in class and kick cars when he was angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter would snap at you for no reason--even when you tried to reach
out to him," said second-year law student Zeke Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to have struggled from the moment he arrived, an immigrant
with four young children and a wife and a serious grudge.</TE>
<TE>   "He always thought he was getting picked on," said Kenneth Brown, a
first-year student. "I had been told to stay away from him."</TE>
<TE>   Grundy, population just over 1,000 and sandwiched between the rolling
hills of Appalachia, was in disbelief Wednesday as news crews rolled in
one after the other and Virginia state troopers cordoned off the
two-story brick law school with yellow police tape.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a close-knit community," said Gov. Mark Warner, a former member
of the law school's board, "will feel such a tragedy especially deeply."</TE>
<TE>   Grundy is indeed close-knit; rather than abandoning the town in the
face of repeat flooding, the residents have banded together, with state
and federal help, on a proposal to move Grundy to higher ground. The
historic downtown is expected to relocate, and nearly the whole
population will likely follow.</TE>
<TE>   Coal mining long had been king here in far southwestern Virginia. But
as the industry has slumped in recent years, civic leaders have been
searching for new ways to stimulate development.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the town's problems, the Appalachian School of Law became a
source of immense pride--and promise.</TE>
<TE>   Established five years ago in a renovated junior high, the school set
forth a mission of training attorneys to serve rural Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky. Its founders hoped that the school would bring
prestige to a region long stereotyped as hillbilly.</TE>
<TE>   Although its students--many of them middle-aged and launching a second
career--come from all over the country, locals have come to view the
school as an integral part of the community and hope that its presence
will spur more and more area residents to strive for higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the school, which has about 250 students, graduated its
first class of 34.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very big deal to get the school in the first place, and then
to get it accredited," said Ed Talbott, director of the local library.</TE>
<TE>   One fervent believer in that mission was the 42-year-old Sutin, a 1984
Harvard Law School graduate who came to Appalachia after serving as an
assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   Gettleman reported from Grundy and Simon from St. Louis. Times staff
writer Massie Ritsch in Los Angeles and researchers Edith Stanley in
Atlanta and John Beckham in Chicago contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>A man who lived with an artificial heart longer than any other U.S.
patient returned home to New Haven after successful surgery to implant a
real heart.</LD>
<LD>   The Novacor artificial heart, implanted Aug. 11, 1998, was intended to
be a temporary fix. But no suitable heart donor could be found, and
Robert Kenyon in August surpassed the longest time anyone in this country
survived with an artificial heart: three years.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, surgeons implanted another artificial heart because the
old one had begun to wear out; 36 hours later, a suitable donor became
available.</LD>

<HD>States Hurry to Block Plans to Clone Humans</HD>
<DH>Science: Several legislatures act as Congress debates the practice.
One bill would let clones sue doctors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The first human clone has not yet been born and may never be. But
Jim Kallinger is thinking ahead. The Florida state legislator last week
filed a bill to give cloned children the right to sue the scientists who
create them, seeking money to cover living expenses, medical costs and
emotional damages.</LD>
<LD>   In Wisconsin, sponsors of a broad anti-cloning bill claim support from
41 of the 99 members of the state Assembly. In Kentucky, a committee of
the state House on Wednesday approved a bill to ban human cloning.</LD>
<LD>   State anti-cloning bills, which are also on the agenda in California,
Massachusetts, Colorado and elsewhere, are a measure of the broad
national unease with the prospect of human cloning. But they also reflect
another fear: that Congress will fail to act.</LD>
<TE>   There is strong support in Washington for a ban on cloning to produce
children. But the House last year voted to bar it as a tool of disease
research as well.</TE>
<TE>   Some senators, by contrast, say a ban should not cover researchers who
aim to produce cloned embryos for their stem cells--the medically
valuable cells that may help cure a range of diseases.</TE>
<TE>   With a Senate vote expected within weeks, a new bioethics advisory
panel appointed by President Bush will put cloning at the top of its
agenda when it holds its first meeting today. The White House announced
the 17 members of the panel Wednesday. Although the council has no
regulatory powers, its deliberations could influence Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some state officials fear that federal legislation may sink
altogether. "I'd rather be safe than sorry. Who knows how long it will
take Congress to push a law through?" said Kallinger, a Republican from
the Orlando area.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's to say there's not a cloned embryo in a womb somewhere in the
country now, and a clone is going to be born?" he said. "I don't think
we're looking at science fiction anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky state Rep. Joseph Fischer, a Republican and sponsor of a
measure to ban human cloning for any purpose, said Kentucky has to be
prepared in case the courts rule that cloning is a matter for state and
not federal regulation. Fischer noted that the Supreme Court has said
Congress had no authority to ban guns near schools because the issue does
not involve interstate commerce.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, conservative groups are trying to build pressure for a
quick Senate vote on the House's broad cloning ban. Some are lobbying
Bush to use his State of the Union address Jan. 29 to call on senators to
pass the House measure.</TE>
<TE>   A new anti-cloning group, led by Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly
Standard magazine, says it is trying to raise money for advertisements
supporting the House's total ban. The ads would run in the states of
undecided senators.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects in the Senate are uncertain, in part because cloning is so
new. "With most issues, there are well-established battle lines," said
Kristol, whose group is called Stop Human Cloning. "People have
well-defined points of view. But this is an issue of first impression in
politics. . . . I think it's a very fluid situation."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen senators are sponsoring legislation to ban cloning
completely. Violators would face jail terms of up to 10 years and fines
of $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ten senators have said they want to allow cloning in disease research
and treatment, often called therapeutic cloning, while banning it to
produce children. They include California's Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, both Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides may be irreconcilable.</TE>
<TE>   Research and patient-advocacy groups envision a day when a patient
would be cloned to produce an embryo, which would be dissected at about
five days of age for its stem cells. The stem cells, in turn, would be
grown into heart, brain or other tissue that matches the patient's genes
exactly, avoiding the tissue rejection problems that are common in organ
transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists face a variety of hurdles in creating a cloning-based cure
for disease, but some are hopeful. "A ban on therapeutic cloning would
delay the discovery of potentially life-saving treatments," said Chis
Paladino of the National Health Council, which represents 120 patient
advocacy groups and disease-related charities.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say it is wrong to allow scientists to create human life
only to destroy it, even to help ailing patients.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's new bioethics advisory council is led by Dr. Leon Kass, a
doctor and bioethicist who favors a total ban on human cloning. They
include an eminent political scientist from UCLA, professor emeritus
James Q. Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the panel are theologians, lawyers and scientists.</TE>
<TE>   One prominent bioethicist, Arthur Caplan of the University of
Pennsylvania, said the panel includes "many smart people," but appears
weighted toward a conservative view of cloning, stem cell research and
other controversial elements of biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   "This president is pro-life, anti-cloning and anti-stem cell research,
and this group will do nothing to shake up those views," Caplan said.</TE>
<TE>   In the states, the legislative debate mirrors the division in
Congress. Wisconsin lawmakers, for example, are considering three
measures, including one that would totally ban cloning and one that would
ban reproductive cloning but allow therapeutic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   In California, home to many biotechnology companies, a ban on
reproductive cloning expires at the end of this year. In a report
presented Monday, an advisory panel told the state Legislature that the
reproductive ban should be renewed but that therapeutic cloning should be
permitted.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal in Florida may be the most far-reaching. It would ban
human cloning for any purpose. The measure would also allow any cloned
person to move to the state and use its courts to sue the people involved
in his or her creation, whether or not it occurred in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The goals of the bill, Kallinger said, are to make sure that a child
born through cloning is not abandoned, and to create a disincentive for
scientists to take up cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists would be liable for schooling, medical and other expenses
of the child, even some costs that continue after the child is grown.
Clones, their relatives and estates could also sue for emotional distress
and other injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "This sends a message around the world, or as far as Florida courts
can reach, to scientists trying to clone humans," Kallinger said. "A
scientist might say, 'I'm not going to clone, because the state of
Florida says I'll have parental responsibilities.' "</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this is hypothetical," he acknowledged. "This whole debate
is really something else. But you have to plan for the worst-case
scenario." At least two teams have publicly announced plans to try to
clone a person, but their capabilities are unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Cheye Calvo, who runs the genetic technologies project at the National
Conference of State Legislatures, said that more bills will be filed as
this year's legislative sessions progress. He said many lawmakers are
reacting to the recent announcement by a Massachusetts company, Advanced
Cell Technology Inc., that it had created cloned human embryos that grew
for three days.</TE>
<TE>   But state cloning proposals have often failed. Six states considered
legislation last year, but only Virginia passed a ban, Calvo said. In
1997, just after the birth of Dolly, the cloned sheep, 23 states
considered bans but only California passed one.</TE>

<HD>Americans Can Go to Turkey--Still</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With the Turkish prime minister at his side, President Bush
announced in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he is lifting a ban on
Americans traveling to Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   There was only one problem. There never was a ban on travel to Turkey.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, Turkey has been on the State Department's "travel
sheet"--the lowest level of a four-tier system that provides information
for U.S. business people and tourists going abroad. A travel sheet often
includes reports on crime and other security concerns in a particular
country.</LD>
<TE>   A State Department official, who requested anonymity, said listing a
nation on a travel sheet basically aims to send a message of "be
careful."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's order will result in a toning down of the cautionary
information about conditions in Turkey, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit perpetuated Bush's error, telling
reporters after their meeting: "We have just got the news . . . from the
president that the ban on tourism to Turkey is to be lifted. So we will
be very happy to see a great number of tourists from the United States."</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for the Turkish Embassy in Washington told The Times:
"There is no travel ban. But I'm not in a position to clarify." The State
Department official, told of Bush's remarks, said: "I don't know what the
president had in mind, but whatever he said, I'm right behind him."</TE>
<TE>   The officer said the department's three other categories are: a
flat-out travel ban; a warning, which he described as, "We're telling you
not to go"; and an advisory, which he said is meant as a caution about
going to a particular country.</TE>
<TE>   On the State Department's Web page (http://www.state.gov), the travel
sheet on Turkey, dated July 5, 2001, notes that "since the 1970s, urban
and rural acts of terrorism throughout Turkey have caused loss of life
and injury to government officials and civilians, including some foreign
tourists."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government had asked for a toning down of that warning,
said Sean McCormack, a National Security Council spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's bureau of consular affairs now will "rework the
sheet to more accurately reflect the socioeconomic and military situation
on the ground in Turkey--to bring it more up to date," McCormack said.
"It's a much more stable situation now in southeastern Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush thanked Ecevit for his support for the war on
terrorism and noted Turkey's improving economy.</TE>
<TE>   "And today, I'm informing the prime minister that we're lifting the
travel ban on Turkey," Bush added.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh that's wonderful," a smiling Ecevit said, interrupting the
president.</TE>
<TE>   Bush continued: "So that our citizens can feel comfortable going to
that wonderful country to visit, and to enjoy the rich history of one of
our valued allies and friends."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Cities Set Security Pact for Olympics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mayor of Houston, one of the four U.S. cities bidding to host
the 2012 Olympic Games, said Wednesday that all four have agreed to what
he called an "unprecedented security pact" should one of the four win the
right to stage the Games.</LD>
<LD>   Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown said he had proposed in recent days to the
mayors of New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., that they share
"ideas and resources" on the "major security issues" at the Games, from
the design of the Olympic grounds to plans for policing the Games.</LD>
<LD>   All agreed, Brown said.</LD>
<TE>   "One thing we don't want to see is anybody taking seriously the notion
that America would not compete [for the Games] because of security
issues," Brown said in a telephone interview with The Times. "That would
be a defeat we should not stand for."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor acknowledged that he developed his proposal in response to
recent reports that have documented the escalating costs of staging the
Olympics, in particular security costs. The scope of the financial
undertaking has sparked debate about the future direction of the Olympic
enterprise in the United States, where recent editions of the Games have
been a public-private partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Direct funding for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics totals $1.9
billion; federal, state and local taxpayers will fund about $600 million
of that.</TE>
<TE>   Security costs alone amount to $310 million, more than three times
that of the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. The federal government has
invested $240 million in security funding, $55 million since the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the increasing costs, Salt Lake Organizing Committee President
Mitt Romney has suggested that the U.S. government might be factored into
the process by which a U.S. city is chosen to bid for the Games--which
now is the sole responsibility of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee will select the 2012 host city in
2005. Moscow, Madrid and Rio de Janeiro are among those expected to
compete against the winner of the U.S. bid process.</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake, the U.S. Secret Service has taken the lead role in
combined federal, state and local law enforcement planning for the Games.
Nonetheless, city police traditionally have played a key role in U.S.
Games.</TE>

<KH>NEWS ANALYSIS</KH>
<HD>After Enron, Bush Has Little Wiggle Room</HD>
<DH>Policy: President generally is opposed to regulation of business.
But Capitol Hill is abuzz with calls for reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s collapse is forcing President Bush to balance his
skepticism of government regulation against his desire to show his
independence from the failed energy giant.</LD>
<LD>   From the federal rules governing private pensions to securities law,
accounting standards and even campaign finance reform, proposals are
proliferating on Capitol Hill for laws and regulations to cope with the
questionable practices highlighted by the company's crash.</LD>
<LD>   These multiplying Enron-related reform ideas present a pointed
political dilemma for Bush.</LD>
<TE>   He arrived in Washington generally committed to rolling back federal
regulation of business. And he has staffed many key regulatory
agencies--including the Securities and Exchange Commission--with alumni
of the industries they oversee.</TE>
<TE>   But now, many analysts say, the White House may face irresistible
pressure to distance itself from Enron by proposing new policy
initiatives that respond to the firm's alleged abuses. This pressure "is
going to nudge [the administration] even further away from its basic
[anti-regulatory] ideological instincts," said Donald Kettl, a political
scientist at the University of Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   In the firestorm over Enron, Bush may face a political imperative
similar to one that confronted President Clinton when his 1996 campaign
fund-raising practices came under intense criticism. Clinton tried to
transmute an ethical controversy into a policy debate by arguing that the
real problem was a flawed system--not his own actions--and proposing
campaign finance reform.</TE>
<TE>   Bush may likewise seek to shift the debate from his administration's
personal and political links with Enron toward policy reforms in areas
such as securities and pension law.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [the administration] has a legal problem [in Enron],
based on what we know to date," said John Podesta, former Clinton White
House chief of staff. "But they have a political problem--this is maybe
the prototypical example of their connection to the wealthy, the
powerful, the people who shave the rules to their own benefit. . . . And
I think their cure for that will be coming up with some proposals to . .
. better protect pensions in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has already taken a long step toward sanctioning new activism by
appointing two administration task forces to review federal rules
governing 401(k) pension plans and corporate disclosure requirements
under the securities laws. Separately, the SEC on Wednesday confirmed a
Washington Post report that it is looking at strengthening the accounting
industry's self-regulatory system.</TE>
<TE>   The range of issues spotlighted by Enron's failure "is going to
require careful attention and deliberation, and we hope there wouldn't be
overreaction," said Dan Bartlett, White House communications director.
"But at its core, there are needed reforms and this administration
welcomes the process."</TE>
<TE>   All this talk of "needed reforms" is raising concerns among business
groups that have supported the administration's deregulatory thrust.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem to make a lot of sense not to change the entire world
because of one bad actor," said Bruce Josten, executive vice president
for government affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Because that's
not going to be beneficial to anybody; it just makes everything more
complicated and expensive."</TE>
<TE>   The profusion of reform proposals follows a powerful historical
pattern. For more than a century, scandals have been the incubator of
reform, inspiring many of the key statutes regulating business and the
way Washington itself operates.</TE>
<TE>   Financial scandals before World War I led to the creation of the
Federal Reserve System, Kettl noted, and widespread securities fraud in
the 1920s inspired the initial federal legislation regulating the stock
markets during the New Deal. Patronage scandals inspired the modern Civil
Service system in the 1880s, and Watergate generated campaign finance and
lobbying reforms in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the growth of the enormous federal regulatory
apparatus . . . at each stage, there has been some kind of problem that's
grabbed public attention and . . . moved Congress to act," Kettl said.</TE>
<TE>   That dynamic is repeating itself with Enron. Members of Congress,
especially Democrats, and outside reform groups are advancing an array of
proposals to respond to the company's meltdown, including:</TE>
<TE>   Pension reform: After workers were left holding retirement accounts
stuffed with worthless Enron stock, Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and
Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) quickly proposed legislation that would limit the
amount of an employer's stock that workers could place in their 401(k)
retirement plans to 20%. (No limit currently exists.) The measure also
would provide workers more freedom to sell that stock if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups are bracing for some changes, but many are adamantly
opposed to the Boxer-Corzine plan. Employers argue the proposal could
lead to reduced pension benefits at thousands of companies that now match
employee retirement contributions with shares of company stock. "If you
make it too difficult, or too costly, or just too much of a headache for
me [to contribute to employee retirement plans], what do I do?" asks
Josten rhetorically. "I say, I'm not going to do that anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett says that while Bush hasn't made any final judgments, the
administration believes the "most obvious" reforms demanded by Enron's
failure are in the rules governing 401(k) plans. Most expect Bush to
propose changes less sweeping than those sought by Boxer and Corzine.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting reform: This may be the arena where the administration
faces the most jarring collision between its initial instincts and the
new political reality. All of Bush's three appointees to the SEC have
worked for the accounting industry; his choice as chairman, Harvey L.
Pitt, represented the industry as a private attorney, and has long
championed deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   But the failure of Enron's auditor, the Andersen accounting firm, to
reveal the company's hidden losses is creating enormous pressure for
intensified oversight of the accounting industry.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics suggest that the SEC may have to ban accounting firms
from serving as management consultants to firms they audit (the
Clinton-era SEC tried to impose such a separation but was forced to
retreat amid intense resistance). More sweepingly, a commission
spokesperson said the SEC is considering a proposal to replace the
existing industry-controlled self-regulatory structure with a new system
governed by members largely from outside the accounting business.</TE>
<TE>   But given Pitt's long-standing preference for limiting regulation,
some accounting industry critics say the devil will be in the details of
any such proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Energy trading: With intense lobbying, Enron won decisions from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1993 and Congress in 2000 that
largely exempted from federal oversight its lucrative business in trading
contracts to supply electricity. In effect, those decisions allowed Enron
to create a multibillion-dollar online exchange in which neither the
price, volume nor terms of contracts were publicly available--a stark
contrast with the transparency at the major stock and commodity
exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Enron's business strategy, its sole focus was removing
as much government oversight from its operations as possible," said Tyson
Slocum, an energy expert at Public Citizen, a consumer group.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) is pushing legislation to require more
disclosure about the terms of energy trades; House Democrats working with
Slocum want to completely overturn the 1993 and 2000 decisions and place
the trading back under federal regulatory oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reform: Enron's lavish contributions to Bush and
members of Congress from both parties have provided campaign reformers a
powerful new symbol of excess. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) predicts
the company's collapse will soon push advocates over the top in their
drive to acquire 218 signatures on a petition to force a House vote on
campaign finance legislation that already passed the Senate.</TE>

<HD>Debate Heats Up Over SEC Chief's Role in Enron Probe</HD>
<DH>Regulators: Pitt, a former legal advocate for accounting firm
Andersen, deflects calls to recuse himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Political pressure escalated Wednesday on Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt to disqualify himself from the SEC
probe of Enron Corp. and its auditors, Andersen, because of Pitt's prior
role as a legal advocate for Andersen and other Big Five accounting
firms.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt so far has deflected such calls, saying that as chairman, he does
not manage investigations, and he intends to follow all the legal and
ethical requirements of his post.</LD>
<LD>   "Talk about recusals misperceives how this agency operates," he said
in a statement Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC disclosed for the first time Wednesday that Pitt, along with
Commissioner Laura S. Unger and then-Commissioner Isaac Hunt,
participated in the commission's unanimous Oct. 30 vote to open a formal
investigation of Enron, the Houston energy trader that collapsed last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has recused himself from the Justice
Department's criminal probe of Enron, citing a conflict of interest.
Ashcroft received $57,000 in contributions from Enron for his
unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate from Missouri last year.</TE>
<TE>   At least two U.S. senators, Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Jon Corzine
(D-N.J.), earlier asked Pitt to step back from the Andersen portion of
the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, a former partner in the New York law firm of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, played a leading role in the accounting
industry's long and ultimately successful fight to head off proposed SEC
rules that would have barred accounting firms from doing certain kinds of
consulting work for companies whose books they audit.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the "auditor independence" rules that the SEC finally adopted
last year call for greater disclosure of the dual roles that accounting
firms play rather than strict limitations.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is central to the debate over Enron's collapse. Critics
contend that Andersen may have been reluctant to aggressively pursue
Enron's dubious accounting practices because at the same time it was
conducting its audit, it was performing lucrative consulting work for
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Enron last year paid Andersen $25 million for its auditing but $27
million for non-auditing consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Levitt, Pitt's predecessor as SEC chief and the main force
behind the agency's push for tougher auditor-independence rules, said in
an interview Wednesday that during his tenure, he recused himself from
several votes involving companies whose stock he owned or on whose boards
he had served.</TE>
<TE>   "I think every chairman has recused himself at some point," Levitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he agreed with Pitt that the chairman does not directly
oversee investigations and that such a recusal would be "largely
ceremonial."</TE>
<TE>   But Scott Harshbarger, president of political reform group Common
Cause, said that Pitt's previous work for Andersen gave "the appearance
of a conflict of interest that will make it more difficult for him to

Pitt to recuse himself.</TE>
<TE>   The people who are calling for Pitt to remove himself from the
Enron/Andersen probe have their eye on the wrong ball, Columbia
University law professor John C. Coffee said last night.</TE>
<TE>   "I have really no doubt there will be an independent, thorough and
objective investigation of both Enron and Andersen," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   Far more significant is what happens in the future, Coffee said,
noting that the SEC and the accounting industry are negotiating over a
new oversight structure for the profession.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Pitt has scheduled a news conference today in Washington to
discuss proposed reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "This should be a source of concern to Congress," Coffee said. "Any
important structural reform--and I believe the industry needs it--should
involve legislation" rather than just SEC rule-making.</TE>

<DL>LAUDERHILL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A plaque intended to honor black actor James Earl Jones at a
Florida celebration of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. instead paid
tribute to James Earl Ray, the man who killed the black civil rights
leader, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The plaque's designer made the error, said Gerald Wilcox, owner of
Lauderhill-based Adpro, which ordered the plaque. It was being corrected
for Jones' visit to the Fort Lauderdale suburb Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We were very upset," said Wilcox.</LD>
<TE>   Over a background featuring stamps of famous black Americans,
including King, the erroneous plaque read, "Thank you James Earl Ray for
keeping the dream alive."</TE>
<TE>   Ray shot and killed King in Memphis in 1968. King is honored across
the nation Jan. 21, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</TE>
<TE>   Texas-based Merit Industries, which made the plaque, blamed a
typographical error.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy Wants Tax Cut Slowed</HD>
<DH>Economy: With growing deficit, breaks for rich must be modified to
meet needs of social programs, he says. Bush rejects idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) on Wednesday proposed slowing down
the tax cut passed last year and President Bush immediately rejected the
idea, framing an issue expected to play a major role in this year's
congressional elections.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy, who last week joined Bush in a three-state tour celebrating a
bipartisan agreement on education policy, is the most prominent Democrat
to call for altering the 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut the White House
touts as one of its signature achievements. Other leading Democrats,
including Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, have
intensified their criticism of the law but have stopped short of urging
changes to it.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech at the National Press Club, Kennedy argued that an
escalating budget deficit demands that tax cuts aimed at the affluent be
modified if high-priority social needs are to be met.</LD>
<TE>   "Future additional tax breaks for the wealthy do not deserve higher
priority than strengthening education, covering prescription drugs under
Medicare, or protecting Social Security, or meeting other urgent national
priorities," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle and many other Democrats are fearful of the potential
political damage of pushing for the changes advocated by Kennedy, and
argue that it is Bush's job to respond to the budget deficit. But
Kennedy's speech established a liberal Democratic alternative to Bush's
own effort to focus on domestic policy as both parties gear up for
November elections in which control of the House and the Senate will be
at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush this week has continued to mention the cooperation he
and Kennedy achieved to gain passage of the bill seeking to improve
public schools, he quickly slammed the door concerning compromise in the
tax arena.</TE>
<TE>   "When the economy slows down, it makes sense to cut taxes, and that's
exactly what's happened," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He equated a delay in imposing tax cuts with a tax increase, an
argument other Republicans are sure to echo on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Raising taxes in the midst of a recession is wrong economic policy,"
Bush said. "It would be a huge mistake. It's bad for American workers. It
will hurt when it comes to creating jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The tax cut was at the center of Bush's economic policy during his
first year in office and cleared Congress with a smattering of Democratic
support.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's plan would delay $350 billion of the tax breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said families earning less than $130,000 a year and filing
joint income tax returns would be unaffected, and that no one would pay a
higher tax rate than currently required.</TE>
<TE>   He proposed postponing future reductions in the top three income tax
brackets--those at 31% and above. Under the new law, these income tax
rates will be shaved by 1% this year, in 2004 and in 2006. Kennedy would
hold off the cuts in 2004 and 2006.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he would retain the tax on estates of more than $4
million. Under the new law, the estate tax is to be gradually reduced and
eliminated in 2010. But it could return a year later because the entire
tax cut expires at the end of the decade unless Congress opts to renew
it.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy said that, under his plan, wealthy taxpayers "will receive
less of a tax reduction than they anticipated, but they still will be
receiving billions of dollars in new tax breaks."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy's speech took on the tenor of a Democrat's version of the
State of the Union address, setting out an ambitious national agenda.</TE>
<TE>   He called for an intense focus on education, health care and
prescription drug costs, particularly for the elderly, presenting the
domestic agenda as the counterpart to the military action in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We can and should support President Bush's conduct of the war, and
still ask the administration to join us in addressing the urgent needs of
our people in areas like jobs, education, health care and equal rights,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the White House sought to counter Kennedy, it also continued
its efforts to lump Daschle with those who would scale back the tax cut.
Administration officials have said at times that Daschle favored a tax
increase--a course he pointedly did not advocate. At a Wednesday
breakfast with reporters, Office of Management and Budget Director
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. recognized that Daschle had not called for a tax
increase, but suggested that the Senate majority leader favored higher
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In Daniels' view, Kennedy said "the one thing that Sen. Daschle didn't
bring himself to say, that the Democratic position would be in favor of
higher taxes. That's an honest debate."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels said Kennedy's proposal would do little or nothing to erase
the federal budget deficit: "He makes it very explicit he wants to spend
all the money."</TE>

<HD>Justices Weigh States' Role in HMO Disputes</HD>
<DH>Law: Some on the U.S. high court signal they are rethinking
previous ruling, based on the issue of insurance regulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Fifteen years ago, the Supreme Court closed the door to most
Americans who wanted to sue their HMO or challenge its refusal to pay for
medical treatment. In a unanimous ruling, the justices said the
regulation of pensions and other employee benefits, including health
care, was "exclusively" a federal matter, off-limits to the states.</LD>
<LD>   But during an oral argument Wednesday, some of the justices sounded as
though they were having second thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor said a new Illinois
law allowing outside medical review of HMO disputes appears to be a type
of insurance regulation--and states traditionally regulate insurance.</LD>
<TE>   "They say this is insurance regulation. Why is that so totally wrong?"
Stevens asked a lawyer representing a Chicago health maintenance
organization that is challenging the Illinois law.</TE>
<TE>   Congress did not take away the state's power to "regulate insurance,"
O'Connor commented. "You could view this that way," as insurance
regulation, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a conflict involving insurance, the state wins," interjected
Justice Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange may signal a new willingness on the court's part to allow
some state regulation of HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Congress has been debating a patients' bill of rights
that would allow individuals to challenge managed care companies, but the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks pushed that effort aside.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, attention has focused on the case that came before the
high court Wednesday: Rush Prudential HMO vs. Debra Moran, 00-1021.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Illinois, 40 other states, including California, have passed
laws giving patients the right to an independent review if their HMO
refuses to pay for a medical treatment. If the review finds that the care
was medically necessary, the state can force the HMO to cover the cost.
The fate of all those laws appears to hang on Moran's case.</TE>
<TE>   Moran, a speech therapist from suburban Chicago, suffered intense pain
in her shoulder in 1996. Her HMO offered physical therapy, but when her
condition did not improve, Moran found a specialist who proposed a rare
type of nerve surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rush Prudential refused coverage for the operation, Moran
went ahead with the surgery and paid the $95,000 cost on her own. She
then sought an independent review of her case under a rarely used
Illinois law that regulates HMOs. A specialist at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore agreed with Moran and said the surgery was
medically necessary. The state ordered the HMO to reimburse her.</TE>
<TE>   Washington attorney John G. Roberts, representing Rush Prudential,
urged the justices to overturn the state's order and strike down the
state law.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a new remedy . . . and it changes what the plan provides,"
Roberts said. "It says if you don't like what your HMO did, you go to a
state board and get it overturned."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts argued that Congress and the Supreme Court had already
foreclosed such a separate state remedy. "You decided that unanimously 15
years ago," he told the justices.</TE>
<TE>   But a Bush administration lawyer joined Moran's Chicago lawyer in
urging the court to uphold independent review of HMOs as a form of
insurance regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a state insurance law, and it sets up a familiar mechanism:
You get a second opinion from a physician," said Daniel P. Albers,
Moran's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The American Medical Assn. and California health care advocates filed
briefs supporting Moran, while the Health Insurance Assn. of America and
other medical insurers supported Rush Prudential.</TE>
<TE>   The justices struggled with the issue during the argument, and most
gave no hint of how they were leaning. The court will issue a ruling in
several months.</TE>

<LD>Neither spoke proudly of the past. One of the last times William
Harris agreed to discuss his leadership of the Symbionese Liberation
Army--and the terror it spread in the mid-1970s--he was
characteristically harsh.</LD>
<LD>   "Did I accomplish anything?" he mused over breakfast in San Francisco
more than two years ago. "Yeah, I accomplished ignominy."</LD>
<LD>   Emily Harris, his former wife and onetime partner in crimes that
galvanized America, including the kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst, was
equally blunt: "I made choices," she said during an interview arranged
with great secrecy in Burbank, "and, looking back now, I think some of
those choices were extremely reckless and ill-conceived."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday--nearly 27 years after the fact--when William and Emily,
and former cohort Michael Bortin, were arrested in the 1975 murder of
Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four gunned down during an SLA bank robbery in
the town of Carmichael, near Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Also taken into custody in connection with the killing was Sara Jane
Olson. She surrendered two days before her scheduled sentencing for for
attempting to bomb Los Angeles police officers by planting explosives
under their squad cars. Olson had been a fugitive for more than 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   As with Olson's 1999 capture on those charges, the arrests Wednesday
yanked a cast of former renegades out of middle-class lives that were
uneventful for years.</TE>
<TE>   William Harris, 57 and remarried, served nearly eight years at San
Quentin for some of his SLA activities but managed to move to the other
side of the law, working in recent years as a private investigator.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, he conducted investigations for the district attorney's
office in San Francisco, but his felony record kept him from obtaining a
state license he sought in 1995 to continue that work, according to a
state official.</TE>
<TE>   Harris subsequently moved back into private investigation by joining
with a licensed partner and has been working for San Francisco criminal
defense attorney Stuart Hanlon. Hanlon has represented Emily Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Harris and his current wife, Rebecca S. Young, a San Francisco
attorney who works with Hanlon, live in Oakland with their two sons, ages
13 and 7. Harris was taken into custody Wednesday morning while driving
the boys to school, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   She learned of the arrest when the boys phoned her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Harris, 55, boasted of waging a hunger strike in the women's
prison in Frontera to get a coveted slot in the institution's computer
training program. After serving almost eight years, she parlayed her new
skills into a career. Living under her maiden name, Emily Montague, she
became a computer consultant and shared a home with another woman in
Altadena.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor in the upscale section of Altadena--home to corporate
executives and engineers at Pasadena's nearby Jet Propulsion
Laboratory--remembered taking a young daughter trick-or-treating at the
home.</TE>
<TE>   "She saw my daughter and was so nice," Gilien Silsby said of Emily.
"She said she was cute and gave her a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. . . . I
cannot believe she is Emily Harris and we lived across the street from
her all this time."</TE>
<TE>   The third suspect arrested Wednesday, Bortin, had been living in
Portland, Ore. In 1988, he married another former SLA member, Josephine
Soliah--the sister of Sara Jane Olson. They are raising four children,
the youngest of whom is 12. Bortin has spent 20 years running a hardwood
flooring business, and has denied any involvement in the Carmichael
robbery, according to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty shocking," Soliah-Bortin said of the arrest. Police
officers in bulletproof vests forced Bortin to the ground and pointed
guns at his head as they handcuffed him, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is they did a bit of overkill this morning," she said. "We
weren't going to come out with guns ablazing. We're just two middle-aged,
middle-class, hard-working people who were not expecting this."</TE>
<TE>   During an interview with The Times shortly after Sara Jane Olson's
arrest put the SLA back in the news, Bortin talked of the two former
leaders of the movement--William and Emily, or Teko and Yolanda, as they
were known among followers--as if they had become two members of the
local PTA.</TE>
<TE>   "They're middle-class people," Bortin said at the time. "People drift
toward what they're meant to be."</TE>
<TE>   The Harrises were products of well-to-do Midwestern families. William
became a U.S. Marine and earned a master's degree in urban education.
Emily was a straight-A student and college sorority sister.</TE>
<TE>   They became embittered, however, at what Emily later described as a
"loss of hope" in America.</TE>
<TE>   "We were reacting to the war in Vietnam, the assassinations of John
Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the Black Panthers,
government surveillance," she said when interviewed by The Times in 1999.
"We felt a revolution was going to happen. By 1972 and '73, we realized
the world wasn't going to change."</TE>
<TE>   They tried to orchestrate that change themselves through a violent
anti-establishment campaign.</TE>
<TE>   When interviewed by The Times, William Harris talked about the
revolution he tried to lead by observing the spectacular way in which it
failed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do something and you succeed," he said, "then you're a
revolutionary of high quality and you get to be George Washington, the
father of the country. But if you challenge power and you're rubbed out,
you're in the trash bin of history."</TE>
<TE>   He also pondered the day--which has now come--when he would have to
tell his sons about his SLA past. His oldest was 11 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows something's going on," Harris said. "I'll sit down with him
when he's 18 and try to explain it to him."</TE>

<LD>There are differing opinions whether Steve Spurrier will succeed in
his new venture as coach of the Washington Redskins.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with Leonard Shapiro of the Washington Post, Gil
Brandt, longtime talent evaluator for the Dallas Cowboys during their
successful reign under Coach Tom Landry, said: "The guy has the unique
knack of being successful in anything he does. All you do is just go play
golf with him. The guy competes like there's no tomorrow."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Spurrier: Bill Lyon in the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Next season,
the Eagles will get two cracks, at least, against Spurrier, and those
games should be especially intriguing, seeing as how the Birds' pass
defense is their forte.</TE>
<TE>   "The temptation is to assume that Spurrier will produce a whole flock
of 51-49 games and make the days of Air Coryell seem like the Red Baron
and bi-wing planes.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is difficult to see Spurrier's sideline tirades and his
impatient quarterback hook wearing well, or long, in the pros."</TE>

<TE>   Zamp the champ: Lou Zamperini, 84, who ran a leg with the Olympic
torch Tuesday in Los Angeles, was once holder of the interscholastic mile
record of 4:21.3 that he established at Torrance High in 1935. That
record endured for 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   Zamperini enrolled at USC, where he was the NCAA mile champion in 1938
with a meet-record time of 4:08.3.</TE>

portraying Howard Cosell, recalled this writer meeting Cosell at a
luncheon arranged by longtime friend Dick O'Leary, an ABC television
executive, during the Lakers' NBA championship series with the Knicks in
New York in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   I was the Laker beat writer for The Times and Cosell asked for my
prediction.</TE>
<TE>   I said I thought the Lakers would win it in five games. Cosell then
boomed: "You are absolutely correct because you agree with me!"</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers did win it in five games. No telling how Cosell would have
reacted if I had disagreed with him.</TE>

<LD>\o7 A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard, observed,
worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>\f7   What: "Playing Lessons From the Pros: Managing Your Game"</LD>
<LD>  Where: The Golf Channel, Mondays, 6 and 9 p.m.</LD>
<TE>  It's not often one gets to play golf with professionals and learn their
secrets of the game. And it is usually costly.</TE>
<TE>  The Golf Channel is not offering free rounds with pros, but it has come
up with a show that may be the next best thing.</TE>
<TE>  "Playing Lessons," a six-part series that makes its debut Monday, is
formatted so that golfers get tips first-hand from pros while they are on
the course. In Monday's show, viewers will get the feeling they are
playing a practice round with Tom Lehman.</TE>
<TE>  Featured in upcoming half-hour shows will be Bruce Lietzke, Lee Janzen,
John Cook, Billy Andrade and Wendy Ward.</TE>
<TE>  The golfers wear microphones and talk throughout the round. Along the
way they stop at times to delve more deeply into topics.</TE>
<TE>  The first show opens with Lehman talking about putting and how he has
learned to give himself more leeway with putts. "If I hit a good putt and
it doesn't go in, that's OK but it was a good putt," Lehman says.</TE>
<TE>  On the tee box, he talks about good balance and good tempo. "Then just
rip it," he says.</TE>
<TE>  When a tee shot rolls off the back of the green on a par three, Lehman
says, "OK, your shot," giving the viewer the feeling he is right there.</TE>
<TE>  Lehman discusses all types of shots. Facing an approach shot, he
decides a bump and run is better than a lob shot. Then he shows the
viewer why.</TE>
<TE>  Golfers should love this series. The Golf Channel is already planning a
second set, which will be shown later this year.</TE>

<LD>The top Russian women figure skaters stumbled through the opening
round of their last competition before the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   Defending champion Irina Slutskaya fell face-first on a routine double
axel, and teammate Maria Butyrskaya failed to make a required jump
combination during qualifying rounds of the European Figure Skating
Championships on Wednesday at Lausanne, Switzerland.</LD>
<LD>   But despite the falls and sprawls, both women won their groups.</LD>
<TE>   "It's good it's right now," Slutskaya said. "We are just warming up
for a good competition."</TE>

<TE>   Sweden's Mats Wilander, who won seven Grand Slam singles titles, and
doubles specialist Pam Shriver of the United States were elected to the
International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I. They will be inducted
July 13.</TE>
<TE>   Wilander, 37, was ranked No. 1 in 1988, when he won the Australian,
French and U.S. opens. He won three Australian, three French and one U.S.
Open title.</TE>
<TE>   Shriver, 39, won 21 singles titles and 112 doubles titles in 18 years
as a professional, including a record 109 doubles victories with Martina
Navratilova.</TE>
<TE>College Football</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Bob Toledo has exercised the rollover in his seven-year
contract, extending it through the 2008 season. The move is a formality
and is initiated annually by Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetual seven-year deal ensures that Toledo, 55, will get
lucrative severance pay if he is fired.</TE>
<TE>   Another compensation issue is still pending.</TE>
<TE>   When Athletic Director Pete Dalis announced several months ago that he
would retire in June, he said buyout terms in the contracts of Toledo and
basketball Coach Steve Lavin would be increased.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of the new contracts has been finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn gave Coach Tommy Tuberville a one-year contract
extension....Washington State junior quarterback Jason Gesser played in
the Sun Bowl with a broken bone in his throwing hand but didn't tell
Coach Mike Price.</TE>
<TE>Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers do not know if the death of a Las Vegas waitress makes moot
her battery and sex harassment lawsuit against Dennis Rodman.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Chapa, 62, was found dead Sunday in her home at Henderson, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy determined she died of a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Rodman's lawyer, Corey Eschweiler, said U.S. District Judge Philip Pro
has scheduled a hearing Feb. 4 at which he could dismiss the case.</TE>
<TE>   The civil lawsuit, filed in July 1999, accuses Rodman of pinching
Chapa and grabbing her breasts in June 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A federal law credited with transforming women's athletics
discriminates against men in low-profile college sports, coaches and
athletes said in a lawsuit against the government filed in U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit blames a 1996 rule clarifying the 1972 statute known as
Title IX, which prohibits any school or college that receives federal
funding from discriminating based on sex in sports or academics.</TE>
<TE>   Filed against the Education Department, the lawsuit contends that as a
result of those rules and court decisions interpreting them, many schools
have come to see trimming men's sports as the only way to achieve
equality.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Balderman, 19, has filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania Common Pleas
Court in Philadelphia against the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. and
the Daily Racing Form for $103,000, claiming he shouldn't have been
thrown out of a handicapping contest last year for being underage.</TE>
<TE>   Balderman also is seeking additional unspecified damages, saying he
was defamed in the Daily Racing Form's coverage of the incident, his
attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Balderman was leading the contest when he was
ejected, so he's seeking the $100,000 grand prize.</TE>

<HD>Fox to Cut National Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox Sports Net announced Wednesday that beginning Feb. 11 it will
deliver national sports news in a different format, with twice hourly
sports news breaks from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. replacing the "National Sports
Report."</LD>
<LD>   There will be four news breaks an hour during "The Best Damn Sports
Show Period," a nightly program. The breaks will not interrupt game
coverage but will interrupt such non-event programming as "The Last Word
With Jim Rome" and "Beyond the Glory."</LD>
<LD>  The "Southern California Sports Report" will remain in place, and may
soon be expanded to one hour to include local and national news. The
one-hour format first will be tested in one of the nine regional networks
owned by Fox, but six other networks affiliated with Fox will drop their
local shows entirely.</LD>
<TE>  Those six are owned by Rainbow, a 50% partner in Fox Sports Net and a
division of Cablevision. They are located in the Bay Area, Florida,
Chicago, New England, Ohio and include one of the two regional sports
networks in New York.</TE>
<TE>  The "National Sports Report," broadcast from Fox's Los Angeles studios,
was started in 1996 to compete with ESPN's "SportsCenter," but recently
was drawing about one-fifth as many viewers as "SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>  "We want to further differentiate ourselves from the competition," Fox
Sports Net President Tracy Dolgin said.</TE>
<TE>  Dropping the "National Sports Report" will result in fewer than 20 job
cuts, Dolgin said.</TE>

<HD>Conexant's 1st Quarter Buoyed by Holiday Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hailing a turnaround in all its businesses, communications chip
maker Conexant Systems Inc. on Wednesday reported higher than expected
sales for its fiscal first quarter, boosted by brisk holiday sales of
cellular telephones, personal computers and Xbox game systems.</LD>
<LD>   The Newport Beach company posted sales of $229.5 million, 44% below
the $410.4 million in revenue for last year's first quarter but 14%
higher than fourth-quarter sales. In the past few months, the company
twice increased its sales estimates for the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   But Conexant, which has announced plans to spin of two units, posted a
net loss of $204.5 million, or 80 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Dec. 28, wider than the loss of $199.6 million, or 85 cents a sahre, for
last year's first three months.</LD>
<TE>   The company, which fired nearly 2,000 workers last year to reduce
costs, said it will pare an additional 150 to 200 workers this quarter
from its work force of 6,900.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, nevertheless, were upbeat after Conexant forecast flat to
slightly higher revenue for the current three-month period, a quarter in
which industry sales typically drop about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "Conexant may be one of few chip makers with revenue improvement in
the March quarter," said analyst F. Drake Johnstone of Davenport &amp; Co. in
Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The stock lost 14 cents to close at $12.58 a share on Nasdaq before
results were released. In after-hours trading, the stock went as high as
$13.95 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Conexant Chairman Dwight W. Decker predicted that the company will
turn a profit in the calendar year.</TE>

<LD>Digital light processing, or DLP, produces sharper and brighter
images for television, cinema and computer screens. The system projects
light using a digital micromirror device, or DMD, a chip that contains as
many as 1.3 million mirrors. Each mirror reflects light for one pixel of
the projected image. Hinges tilt the mirrors to reflect or deflect light,
thus producing light and dark pixels. A color wheel between the light
source and the DMD spins several hundred times a minute; when the light
source hits the wheel, color falls on the mirrors. The systems processor
coordinates the positions of each mirror so the appropriate mirrors face
the light source at the time the correct color is projected.</LD>
<TE>Conventional Television</TE>
<TE>   Conventional televisions display images with a cathode ray tube. The
cathode, or heated filament, creates a beam of electrons, which carry a
negative charge and are attracted to a positive anode. When the beam hits
the other end of the tube, its  phosphor coating illuminates. Wires
wrapped around the tube move  the beam horizontally and vertically. Color
televisions have three electron beams and three types of phosphors, one
for each pixel: red, blue and green.</TE>
<TE>   Condensing lens: Focuses light on color filter.</TE>
<TE>   Shaping lens: Forms the light beam into a rectangular shape so it
falls directly on the DMD. Color filter: Contains three colors: red, blue
and green. Others are produced when the mirrors rotate to reflect
multiple colors. Purple, for example, is created when a mirror rotates
between red and blue.</TE>
<TE>   DMD: Spans about 1 inch diagonally. Each mirror on the DMD is about
one-fifth the width of a human hair.</TE>
<TE>   Processor: Interprets incoming video signal and determines which
mirrors should be turned on and off to reflect a certain color.</TE>
