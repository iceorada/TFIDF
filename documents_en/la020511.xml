<HD>Death Now a Prime-Time Undertaking</HD>
<DH>Television* Series characters used to expire off-screen.
Now their dying is milked for ratings.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever so slowly, death has found a prominent place in prime time. Dr.
Mark Greene's passing on "ER" illustrates how the end of life has
become a TV ritual along with birth, marriage and series finales.</LD>
<LD>   The advertiser-driven medium used to treat death off camera, if it
took up the subject at all. Danny Thomas, for instance, directed his
sitcom writers to have his TV wife die during the off-season when
actress Jean Hagen left "Make Room for Daddy" in 1956. He started the
next season as a widower back in the dating game.</LD>
<LD>   On "MASH" in 1975, the unit learned that Col. Henry Blake (McLean
Stevenson) was lost when his plane crashed in the Sea of Japan.</LD>
<TE>   At other times, death has been treated lightly, even flippantly.
The demise of Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) on "Dallas" was written off
as a bad dream in 1986, and other soap operas have made expiration as
easily reversible as removing stains from garments.</TE>
<TE>   In a flashback episode Thursday, "ER" viewers who had watched
Greene (Anthony Edwards) for eight years got to share his last days,
from his leaving the Chicago emergency room to his dying with his
family around him in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Greene has been the center of the show for so long,"
executive producer Jack Orman says. "We thought it was important to
give the audience a strong goodbye, and given the fact he's dying,
there were some things he needed to get in order. He's always been
bugged by difficult relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Starting in 1994, NBC's "ER" brought greater intensity and realism
to medical issues, including death. Newer series have turned bolder
and proved that the audience has a high threshold for issues once
deemed too macabre.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" looks at corpses, wounds and
evidence with clinical fascination as forensic investigators hunt for
explanations. HBO's "Six Feet Under," the quirky drama of an
undertaker's family, makes death a central issue every week.</TE>
<TE>   "Death has become a major part of the television narrative," says
Ron Simon, curator of television at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio
in Manhattan. "There's so much about death being a major character in
the new century. It's not a taboo subject anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The death of a key character such as Greene carries power because
of his duration on a series, says Tim Brooks, coauthor of "The
Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows." In
contrast, the stabbing death of Lucy Knight (Kellie Martin) on "ER"
in 2000 meant less because she wasn't a bedrock of the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Television is a very personal medium," Brooks says. "Viewers see
TV personalities as friends. It's almost like a death in the family.
Many tears are shed on both sides of the screen."</TE>
<TE>   The writers planned Greene's departure--death by brain
cancer--over two years after Edwards announced he would leave the
show. Because "ER" is one of television's highest-rated series, the
writers had time to explore Greene's progress and setbacks without
fear of cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   "'ER' shows people dealing with death on a daily basis--it's one
of the staples of the show," Orman says. "Globally [on television],
death is often used too much as a plot device, in terms of the
mystery type of show. Anybody who's actually lost a loved one, it's a
much bigger deal than it's portrayed on television generally."</TE>
<TE>   The death of Blake on "MASH" was a huge deal that still
reverberates with fans.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw that death entirely through the experiences of
survivors," says Greg Limongi, director of spiritual care and
bereavement services at Florida's Hospice of Orange-Osceola. "I'll
never forget seeing Radar's face," a reference to the character of
Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff). "Sometimes you can convey more
through understatement."</TE>
<TE>   The death of Chuckles the Clown, one of the most famous episodes
of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," presented a humorous side of death
that the culture usually shies away from, Limongi adds.</TE>
<TE>   During the first part of the show, Mary Richards castigated her
newsroom colleagues for their lighthearted reactions to the
ridiculous circumstances of Chuckles' death: Dressed as a peanut at a
circus parade, he was crushed by a rogue elephant. But then she
laughed uncontrollably at his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "We're raised to believe death is only serious and somber,"
Limongi says. "Humor is one of the most powerful releases. You're
sharing something so emotional. At a hospice, we laugh at things
others wouldn't. It's not being irreverent."</TE>
<TE>   Deaths in the television family can take many forms. Characters
can expire because their actors have died: Nicholas "Coach" Colasanto
on "Cheers" and Michael Conrad, who played Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on
"Hill Street Blues."</TE>
<TE>   Or death can open storytelling possibilities. A stroke killed
Edith Bunker (Jean Stapleton) on "Archie Bunker's Place" so that
spouse Archie (Carroll O'Connor) could start dating.</TE>
<TE>   Other deaths loom large because of their shock value. "L.A. Law"
fans will always remember the plunge of Rosalind Shays (Diana
Muldaur) down an elevator shaft.</TE>
<TE>   It's harder to surprise the audience these days because
entertainment journalists closely monitor actors' career changes and
series' plot twists.</TE>
<TE>   And promo-happy networks want to alert viewers because death can
be good business. "An 'ER' to cherish," an oft-repeated NBC spot
called Thursday's episode.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous week's episode, which placed No. 1 in the ratings,
Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle) read a letter announcing Greene's death.
The episode was designed to demonstrate how "ER" will go on and to
signal Carter's emergence as the show's central figure.</TE>
<TE>   "With Dr. Greene being the moral center of the show, he seemed
difficult to replace with someone from the outside," producer Orman
says. "Carter is at the point where Greene was in the pilot. We
always thought of Carter becoming Greene, taking on his role and
making it his own, being a leader."</TE>
<TE>   But whether an actor's choice, a plot development or a ratings
lure, television death has relevance and resonance as never before.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new honesty in looking at the complexity of death and
our emotions that don't fit any stereotypes," says Limongi of Hospice
of Orange-Osceola.</TE>
<TE>   "We are most affected by what is most intimate to us," he says.
"The reading of the letter [about Greene's death] makes it personal.
It doesn't try to make it global. It makes it specific. Then that
becomes universal."</TE>

<HD>'ER' Gets Only a Small Lift From Edwards' Exit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony Edwards' emotional farewell episode of "ER" yielded only a
modest boost for the NBC series, with an estimated audience of 28.7
million people tuning in Thursday, based on estimates from Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Although that represents the highest rating for any program in
four weeks, the audience was actually smaller than for any of the
previous departures by an original "ER" cast member. An audience of
28.9 million watched Eriq La Salle's exit in December; an estimated
32.7 million viewed Julianna Margulies' swan song in May 2000; and
35.7 million saw George Clooney take his leave the year before.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't help that CBS dominated the hour preceding "ER," as
"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (27.1 million) booked its
second-biggest audience yet, exceeding NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" and "Just
Shoot Me" by more than 9 million.</LD>
<TE>   "ER" also faced Fox's telecast of "Star Wars: Episode I The
Phantom Menace," which averaged 8.2 million viewers over three hours.</TE>

<HD>Tipping a Cap to 'The Hat'</HD>
<DH>Exhibition* A display at the motion picture academy recalls
the glory days of the Brown Derby restaurants, commissaries for a
company town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its prime, the Brown Derby wasn't just a restaurant, it was an
institution--a part of Hollywood lore the way Sardi's is a part of
New York. Simply saying the name the Brown Derby conjures up images
of Hollywood's glory days.</LD>
<LD>   During the 1930s, '40s and '50s, all of Hollywood's top movers and
shakers could be found lunching on Cobb salad and lamb stew at the
Hollywood branch of the Derby, located on Vine Street, between
Hollywood and Sunset boulevards (the location has since been paved
and is now a parking lot). Gossip columnist Louella Parsons would be
there every day at noon to report who was eating with whom. Clark
Gable even popped the question to Carole Lombard in the red leather
Booth Five at the Hollywood Derby in 1939.</LD>
<LD>   "Hollywood was a small town," recalls Peggy Cobb Walsh, the
daughter of Bob Cobb, who ran the four Derby restaurants from 1926
until his death in 1970. "It was the golden age of Hollywood. People
dressed up. People were pretty and good looking. Now you just put on
a pair of jeans and you don't know one star from the other."</LD>
<TE>   The Brown Derby Restaurant is the subject of an expansive new
exhibition at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in
Beverly Hills. Located in both the Grand Lobby and Fourth Floor
galleries, "Under the Hat: Hollywood's Legendary Brown Derby
Restaurants," which opened Friday and continues through July 14, will
feature hundreds of vintage photographs of celebrities wining and
dining at the eateries, the famed celebrity caricatures that used to
line the walls, the actual neon sign from the restaurants and a
re-creation of an original booth.</TE>
<TE>   It all started with a dare. Writer Wilson Mizner said to movie
producer Herb Somborn, the second husband of actress Gloria Swanson:
"If you know anything about food, you can sell it out of a hat."
Thus, the first Brown Derby, located on Wilshire Boulevard across the
street from the Ambassador Hotel, was built in the shape of the
famous chapeau. Mizner, Somborn and famed theater owner Sid Grauman
were the original owners.</TE>
<TE>   Somborn hired Cobb to manage the restaurant and when he and Mizner
died in the early '30s, Cobb took over the restaurants. The Hollywood
Brown Derby opened on Valentine's Day 1929; two years later, the
Beverly Hills Brown Derby opened its doors at the corner of Wilshire
Boulevard and Rodeo Drive. The last Derby opened in Los Feliz in
1941. It left the chain and became Michael's restaurant in the 1950s
and is currently called the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Derby, says Walsh, had been built as a theater by
director-producer Cecil B. DeMille. "Then sound came in and it never
opened as a theater," she says. "My dad rented it from the DeMille
family and made it into the restaurant. All of the studios were in
Hollywood except for MGM, which was in Culver City, so it was the
commissary for the motion picture industry."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood Derby was large--250 patrons could be seated in the
main dining room. The booths near the front of the restaurant and
along the walls were the most prized. The movie moguls like Darryl F.
Zanuck, Harry Cohn and Jack and Harry Warner had booths permanently
reserved. The American Room, which opened in 1938, was for private
parties and even had a private entrance on the side of the
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Cobb, the Man Behind the Salad</TE>
<TE>   Cobb was the reason the restaurants were so successful, says Mark
Willems, who co-wrote the 1996 best-seller "The Brown Derby
Restaurant: A Hollywood Legend," with Cobb's widow, Sally.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone I talked to, everyone who knew him, loved him," says
Willems. "He was charming and he was gracious. He was 26 years old
when the Hat opened and from 1926 until his death in 1970, the
restaurants were his life. He had an office upstairs at the Hollywood
restaurant and in the afternoons he would take a nap and be ready for
dinner. He was one of the nation's great restaurateurs."</TE>
<TE>   He also created the popular Cobb Salad. When the Derby first
opened in 1926, it was an all-night eatery. "He got tired of the menu
and just started to save things like bacon and chicken and chopped it
up and got a lot of lettuce," says Walsh. "One night Sid Grauman came
in and asked him what he was doing. He said he was making a salad.
Grauman asked if he could have some and Pa said yes. Then Grauman
would come in and order 'Cobb's' salad. That's how it started."</TE>
<TE>   During the '30s, Hollywood was bustling; not only were the movie
studios nearby, but CBS and NBC radio had their studios just down the
street from the Derby. "On a daily basis, you would have Jimmy
Durante, Burns and Allen and Jack Benny," says Willems. "For
virtually everyone who was in the entertainment industry over the
last 50 years, the Derby was part of their L.A. experiences."</TE>
<TE>   Lucille Ball frequented the Derby from her early days as a starlet
in the 1930s. In 1955, she paid tribute to the Derby in the classic
"I Love Lucy" sketch in which Lucy encounters William Holden at the
Derby. "I think that has kept the Derby known by other generations
because that episode is on someplace once a week," says Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Cobb, all the stars knew Bill Chilias, who was the maitre
d' in Hollywood from 1929 until 1955. "You had to know Chilias to get
a table," says Willems. "His Christmas tips in the 1930s exceeded
$10,000 a year."</TE>
<TE>   Tourists would also flock to the Derby from around the world in
order to nosh next to their favorite star.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not be able to get the best table," says Willems, "and
if it was high noon in Hollywood you might not get a table, but it
was a large restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Oscar parties were often held at the Hollywood Derby, especially
during the 1950s, when the Academy Awards were held down the street
at the Pantages Theater.</TE>
<TE>   NBC did a pre-show one year that was live in the Derby," says
Willems. "Tony Randall was the host and he interviewed all the
nominees before the show."</TE>
<TE>   The Derby also catered parties at celebrities' homes over the
years. "Sally Cobb told me that she would go to parties years later
in Beverly Hills and there would be Derby silver and serving dishes
that would have been catered and never came back," says Willems.
"When Romanoff's opened in Beverly Hills, the Brown Derby loaned them
silver because theirs hadn't come in."</TE>
<TE>   'Hollywood Went Downhill Pretty Fast'</TE>
<TE>   By the time Cobb died 1970, Walsh says, the Hollywood Derby was a
shadow of its former self. "The atmosphere in Hollywood went downhill
pretty fast in the '60s," she says. "We didn't do the business that
we used to. People were afraid to come into Hollywood. My mother sold
the restaurants in 1976." The original Derby closed in 1980; Beverly
Hills followed in 1982 and the Hollywood Derby in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "The world changed," says Willems, when asked why the Derby
restaurants ultimately closed their doors. "When you see the exhibit
and the way people looked and dressed, it seems like it was almost
100 years ago. Playwright Jerome Lawrence told me that when he was
writing for radio, he lived at the Derby in the early '40s. He said,
'Mark, I thought it would always be there.'"</TE>

<DH>Carol Kane, long known for characters such as Simka on
'Taxi,' gets the spotlight onstage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The smoky voice is much bigger than its surroundings, a mere slip of
a woman dressed eyeglasses to toe in New York black.</LD>
<LD>   "Of course, dahling."</LD>
<LD>   Carol Kane is declaiming with a throatiness that's at full
throttle. The character actress' character actress is announcing that
she's taking over the Geffen Playhouse to throw parties for, well,
everybody, just because she likes the building so much.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps not immediately, though. Much as Kane loves the Westwood
theater's stonework, the only romping she plans to do in its midst is
in the guise of the inebriated fallen countess in Georges Feydeau's
unconsummated sex farce "He Hunts" (a.k.a. "Monsieur Chasse!"), which
runs through May 19.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences have been applauding her hilarious turn as sodden
royalty, echoing The Times' Lewis Segal, who crowned Kane "the master
thief" in a company of aspiring scene-stealers. And judging from the
petty larceny she commits every night on stage as Madame Latour, her
performance would be far more entertaining for L.A. theater audiences
than a mere party.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Carol's performance in this show has become a bit of an
event," says director David Schweizer. "It's like, you have to see
Carol Kane. To be noticed to such an extent is so great, because I
really like it when people are rewarded for taking risks."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, anyone expecting to see Simka Gravas, the double
Emmy-winning "mountain person" married to Andy Kaufman's character,
Latka, in "Taxi," will be surprised by Madame Latour, a lusty lush
consumed by delusions of former grandeur. And where Simka squeaked,
Madame prefers to invoke her inner Tallulah Bankhead.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would be liberating if Carol did something that was
not her normal voice or her physical demeanor, and every time I've
worked with Carol it's been like that," says Schweizer, who also
directed Kane as a gangster's moll in Thomas Babe's "Demon Wine" at
LATC in 1989. "I've never actually had the opportunity to work with
her as the breathy-voiced ditz--her signature part."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Kane, 49, and Simka hail from different planets. The
product of an intellectual, artistic New York upbringing--her father
was a Fulbright scholar and architect, her mother a jazz
musician--she's soft-spoken, self-effacing and extremely thoughtful,
choosing her words carefully as she deconstructs her roles and her
career.</TE>
<TE>   Kane laughs easily, particularly when her Tallulah voice
interrupts her conversation for frequent cameo appearances. The
diminutive actress sits in the Geffen's formally appointed room for
donors, wearing a simple Gap jacket and a long, silky skirt, her
cotton-candy curls the color of apricots.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting a big kick out of the very far-out, broad humor" of
"He Hunts," translated by Philip Littell, she says. "I'm finding it a
big challenge though, because it's not exactly in the modern form of
comedy. It starts off more seriously and it escalates into something
broadly comedic, and that's a big challenge for the director and the
actress because in our culture now, everything is fast and the jokes
have got to come up front or it's not funny."</TE>
<TE>   In "He Hunts," much of the humor lies in character. And for Kane,
the countess--who evolved into a woozy tippler as the actress
developed the role--was a natural.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes every single element of a character is a torturous
discovery," she says, "and with the countess, I kind of fell into her
in some big, not fully formed but rapidly formed fashion. David
created a framework for me to work with, and the way she's written,
I'm lucky. She's written juicy."</TE>
<TE>   But Schweizer says Kane's penchant for creating such distinctive
characters is typical of her work. "I think of her as this genius,
consummate actress with limitless range," he says. Schweizer and Kane
are developing a theater piece about Bette Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kane is now often identified with sitcom Simka, she spent
many years as a dramatic actress after her stage debut at 14 in "The
Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" with Tammy Grimes. Three years later, she
snagged her first film role as a girlfriend in 1971's "Carnal
Knowledge." On that set, she struck up a close friendship with Jack
Nicholson and worked with him again two years later, playing a
prostitute in "The Last Detail." Kane began gravitating toward
character roles like Squirrel the bank clerk in "Dog Day Afternoon"
(1975).</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't decide to be a character actress," she says. "I took
parts that either I was offered or felt I could do a good job with.
It has partly to do with my looks, obviously--I'm not this tall,
statuesque sex goddess. And it's partly my appetite to play very
specific, unusual people. But whatever has happened in my career is
not planned. It just kind of occurs as you live and then maybe after
a while it can be looked at and labeled something."</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, it was labeled Oscar material. That was the year she was
nominated for the role of Gitl, the Orthodox Jewish immigrant bride
of "Hester Street." But in some measure, Kane's success in creating
unique characters instead of mere types backfired: She found it hard
to get work.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an extremely specific character--Russian Orthodox Jewish
woman at the turn of the century. I mean, how many of those are
coming down the pike?" she says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   During Kane's pre-Oscar week stay in Los Angeles to do press and
events, the New York-based actress had to shuttle back and forth
between the Beverly Hills Hotel and the unemployment office. She
didn't work for a year, until Gene Wilder cast her in her first
comedic role in 1977's "The World's Greatest Lover," which was
quickly followed by a part in "Annie Hall" as the first wife of Woody
Allen's character.</TE>
<TE>   "She's one of the most talented actresses I've ever worked with,"
Wilder says.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird that Gene Wilder picked me to do 'The World's
Greatest Lover.' I'd never done anything comedic in my entire life,
and so it takes someone who has confidence, a director, a writer, to
think, 'I like the work of that person. I'm going to ask her to play
this part.' People usually say, 'Great. Have they played it before?'
That's such a limiting point of view. I should think people wouldn't
want you to have played it before, but that's not how it works."</TE>
<TE>   As events transpired, Wilder was not just confident, he was right,
and Kane's comedic talents went on to shine in artistically ambitious
TV sitcoms like "Taxi." She later worked on other critically lauded
series, "All Is Forgiven" (1986) and "Brooklyn Bridge" (1991), but
both had brief shelf lives. So although Kane has scored some of her
biggest successes in television, she has also found working on the
small screen to be profoundly frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "'All Is Forgiven' was brilliant and got rave reviews. 'Brooklyn
Bridge' was a beautiful piece of writing," she says. "It's mystifying
to me how they let good stuff like that go. It's totally mystifying
to me how anyone could have canceled 'Taxi.' I don't understand it
because that stuff is rare."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kane is rolling those dice again. She's waiting to hear
whether Fox will pick up "The Grubbs," a comedy pilot she made with
Randy Quaid, a colleague from "The Last Detail." "We're a majorly
underachieving family who's extremely proud of it. We live on his
disability check and that's real good by us," she says and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Kane has appeared in several films, mostly small
independent movies such as Christine Lahti's "My First Mister" last
year and Cindy Sherman's "Office Killer." One of her most difficult
roles was playing herself in "Man on the Moon," the 1999 biopic about
her late co-star Kaufman. "It was very odd and emotional for all of
us, for everyone to be themselves and for Andy not to be there," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the stage continues to beckon. A veteran of the Mt.
Olympuses of theater--Lincoln Center, the Public Theater and the
Kennedy Center--Kane is also a stalwart of Beth Henley's plays. She
has appeared in six, including the 1994 Los Angeles production of
"Control Freaks" with Bill Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun once in a while to get to tell the whole story and
experience the whole art instead of picking up little pieces," she
says of her enduring appetite for the theater. "You actually get to
go through what the experience of the character is from start to
finish, not just pluck out pieces from the middle and do that and
then glue together some other thing."</TE>
<TE>   But as in other media, Kane has learned that every bravo has its
price. "It's frightening and frustrating, too, because from night to
night, it changes. You're better some nights, worse some nights. The
chemistry of the whole show changes. And also, you can be really in
love with the character, and when the run of the play is over, she's
gone.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to look back on, no proof that it ever existed,
really. You can read scripts but you don't have the thrill of
thinking this really worked out well and now you could see it over
and over again. It's gone."</TE>

<HD>Sparta Could Use Its Old Drive</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With its quirky song structures and aggressive stage shows, El Paso's
At the Drive-In was one of the most compelling bands to break out of
the late '90s indie pack--so it's only natural that there's interest
in the two bands, Sparta and Mars Volta, that have emerged from the
splintering of ATDI.</LD>
<LD>   The former--featuring lead guitarist Jim Ward, bassist Paul
Hinojos and drummer Tony Hajjar--had something to prove after Mars
Volta's much buzzed-about performance at the Coachella Music and Arts
Festival last month. Yet Sparta's set Thursday at the Troubadour
didn't push the boundaries one would expect from two-thirds of a
group as unpredictable as ATDI.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, who mans lead vocals for Sparta (Hinojos went from bass to
guitar), has a wistful style that goes from a Robert Smith whine to a
Perry Farrell wail depending on the velocity of the number. Indeed,
on tunes from the band's current EP "Austere," shades of Jane's
Addiction and the Cure were evident vocally and instrumentally, while
Helmet/Fugazi-style riffs and drumbeats kept more somber songs from
dragging.</LD>
<TE>   Ultimately though, Thursday's show lacked the chemistry and
capricious energy these guys would need for another commercial
breakthrough.</TE>

<LD>After reading the article about former NBC executives discussing and
reminiscing about the good old days of television ("Yesterday, When
Cable Seemed So Far Away," by Brian Lowry, May 4), I felt a little
sad.</LD>
<LD>   Sad in the sense that the programs that are on the air today are
so mediocre. Shows today are held together by foul language, bad
stories, dead bodies, people dissecting those dead bodies and, let's
not forget, people so desperate for a moment of fame they will eat
worms and jump off the side of a tall building.</LD>
<LD>   This is what they call entertainment? No wonder nostalgia is so
popular.</LD>

<LD>Thank you to Howard Rosenberg for telling it like it is in his column
about KCOP's nightly newscast ("UPN 13's News for Dummies," May 6).
He couldn't heap enough ridicule on those clowns to satisfy me--and I
don't mean to disparage any actual clowns by comparing them to the
blow-dried and glossy bunch at Channel 13.</LD>
<LD>   "UPN News 13" is like the forgotten candy bar one finds in the
back of a drawer: a gooey, artificial mess that, once consumed,
leaves one feeling slightly queasy and full of regret.</LD>

<TE>   Finally, someone has printed what has been too painfully obvious
for much too long. I moved to Los Angeles two years ago and have been
ranting to my friends about Channel 13 news since I arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Truthfully, what is so upsetting about "UPN News 13" is not the
fact that such tripe is on television; the show is certainly not
completely devoid of entertainment value. It is simply the matter
that the show attempts to pass itself off as news (and prime-time
news at that).</TE>

<LD>Regarding screenwriter John Scott Shepherd's experience in the
development process with "Joe Somebody" and "Life or Something Like
It": I sure hope that if my first couple of scripts become huge
critical flops in consecutive years that I have a good friend like
Patrick Goldstein, with a front-page column in the Calendar section,
to act as my apologist ("Dumbed Down by Committee," May 7).</LD>
<LD>   In this film-savvy town, most folks already know that writers
often go through hell in development, watching helplessly as their
scripts are changed by any number of executives (and other writers)
until they're literally unrecognizable. What Goldstein and Shepherd
seem to forget is that film-savvy people also know that when this
happens, a writer, if he has the courage of his own convictions, has
the option of taking his name off the film.</LD>
<LD>   Guess whose name appears on both "Joe Somebody," a movie Shepherd
professes to hate, and "Life or Something Like It," yet another movie
he claims was ruined by others? John Scott Shepherd's.</LD>
<TE>   Suck it up, guys. That's how the business works, so quit whining.</TE>

<LD>The "Spider-Man" movie is a complete betrayal for real comic book
fans. Hollywood doesn't know what to do with comic book movies. They
gave the "Spider-Man" project to a tried-and-true Hollywood
blockbuster writer, David Koepp. He is a big-budget guy. He is not a
comic book guy. There was too much money at risk for the studio to
give it to an actual comic book writer. They gave this quirky
material to someone who could smooth it out and give it the standard
action-movie beats.</LD>
<LD>   Now people are going to think this is Spider-Man. It looks like
him, but the soul was bled out. Director Sam Raimi did a "don't drop
the camera" type of job. Remember "Evil Dead"? Remember "Darkman"?
There is not one ounce of that style in this film.</LD>
<LD>   Please, big Hollywood studios, just leave this material alone. You
ruin it.</LD>

<LD>The article on Christian movie-rating services ("Christians Are
Putting Faith in Movie-Rating Web Sites," by Mark Pinsky, May 8)
failed to mention the oldest and most well-known of those
organizations, Movieguide, which not only has a Web site (www.movie
guide.org) but also publishes the biweekly Movieguide magazine with
detailed reviews of scores of the latest films.</LD>
<LD>   These efforts are a production of the renowned Ted Baehr's
Christian Film &amp; Television Commission, founded in 1978, which hosts
a gala awards banquet each year honoring those films that most
promote faith and values. Baehr is to be commended for his ministry,
which is dedicated to redeeming the values of the media according to
biblical principles.</LD>

Lot More Than Nostalgia," May 6) was right on.</LD>
<LD>   I was lucky enough to have seen the Beatles perform at the
Hollywood Bowl in '65 and again in '66 at Dodger Stadium. McCartney
has not changed one bit. He is still "the cute one" even though he is
almost 60.</LD>
<LD>   The concert at Staples Center was the best of the best. I have
never heard so many fans singing along and knowing all the words. It
didn't matter if you had front-row seats or the last seat of the top

wonderful to step back into my youth, even if only for 21/2 hours.</LD>

<HD>Attention Turns to Lamya, Poised on a Springboard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Lamya, the latest discovery of music mogul Clive Davis, stepped
onstage Wednesday night at the Viper Room in West Hollywood for an
industry showcase, all the audience saw was a silhouette, as a single
blinding spotlight shining from behind left her face obscured in
shadow.</LD>
<LD>   The flick of a switch quickly turned the front spots on, allowing
most of those packed into the tiny club their first look at this
highly touted singer, songwriter and producer.</LD>
<LD>   But there's another shadow on Lamya, one that may be a little
tougher to remove.</LD>
<TE>   Because she's getting the biggest promotional push by Davis and
his J Records label since their spectacular success last year with
Alicia Keys, the Kenya-born, England-reared Lamya will be under
intense scrutiny. That means the kind of early attention most
freshman pop acts only dream about. It also brings heightened,
perhaps impossible, expectations for her debut album, "Learning From
Falling," which arrives July 30.</TE>
<TE>   Like Keys, whose debut album won five Grammy Awards and has sold
5.1 million copies in the U.S., Lamya writes, sings and produces most
of what she records. Also reminiscent of her predecessor, she sings
revealing, often confessional songs, favors melodic pop tinged with
hip-hop rhythms and spent years in formal music training (as an opera
singer). And just as it did for Keys, J is introducing Lamya to music
industry tastemakers with special performances in key cities.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and his staffers are confident that there are enough
differences to mute any suggestions that Lamya arrives as Alicia, the
Sequel.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always a risk of comparisons, but I think any comparisons
in this case are downright silly," says Davis. "You don't say that
because one artist broke through to 5 million that that's the
expectation and that we'll be disappointed if another artist doesn't
do that. It's very unfair to [Lamya's] artistry. Alicia was her own,
separate story."</TE>
<TE>   If there is any Alicia Keys fallout for Lamya, it could be a plus,
according to Violet Brown, urban music buyer for the Wherehouse
record store chain. "She's a little different, and I think people
right now are responding well to anything that's different," says
Brown. "A lot of people are going to pay attention if Clive Davis is
behind her, so it should do extremely well."</TE>
<TE>   Lamya herself is looking only at the upside of joining a roster of
Davis discoveries stretching back more than three decades, including
Whitney Houston, Janis Joplin, Barry Manilow and Santana.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had to sacrifice anything," Lamya, 28, said at her
hotel Wednesday, as a makeup artist prepared her for the Viper Room
show. "The great thing about working on the album is that my sound
has evolved but I've still got all the elements I wanted on it,
without sounding like we threw in everything but the kitchen sink."</TE>
<TE>   Lamya's globe-hopping background is responsible for the
world-music sensibility that infuses many of her songs. Her parents
moved from Kenya to England when she was a baby so she could go to
school there, then moved back to their native Oman after she had
finished her schooling.</TE>
<TE>   So although Lamya's affinity for snaking pop melodies and loping
hip-hop beats makes her album easily accessible for pop fans, it
quickly distinguishes itself from the modern R&amp;B pack with liberal
doses of sitar and Indian and Middle Eastern percussion.</TE>
<TE>   She credits Davis for giving her the freedom to create the sound
she wanted. Before signing with J Records early last year, she had
been paying dues during the '90s as a backup singer for such
performers as James Brown, David Bowie and Duran Duran. She also sang
on two albums by R&amp;B group Soul II Soul. What most appealed to her
about Davis and his label was a request they made after hearing
several demos she'd put together in the previous months.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted copies of the lyrics," she says. "It was the only
record company that bothered to ask for them, so I knew I was with
the right people."</TE>
<TE>   What Davis found when he read those lyrics, he says, was "someone
with a different sense of imagination, a depth, an introspection, not
just a voice and a melody. There's an honesty amid the poetry and a
soulfulness combined with everything else that affects you."</TE>
<TE>   For her 35-minute performance Wednesday, Lamya offered "Empires,"
which expresses her yearning for "men with empires in their purpose
... and new eras in their brains." She sang "Never Enough," a
soul-baring tale of a woman trying to retain her ideals and
self-worth while the man she loves battles with substance abuse, and
"Black Mona Lisa," an autobiographical salute to anyone willing to
chart her own path. Her music moved from the internationally spiced
sensuality of Sade to the jazz-influenced free-form vocalizing of
Jill Scott to the more raucous rock side of Alanis Morissette.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she cites Morissette, Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan,
rather than neo-soul singers such as Keys, Scott and India.Arie, as
the contemporary performers with whom she feels most closely aligned.</TE>
<TE>   That can be traced to a childhood spent listening to her parents'
record collection, which was full of the major rock and pop acts of
the 1960s and '70s, from the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd to
singer-songwriters Cat Stevens and James Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't much dance music or R&amp;B in the house, so I didn't
get much of that Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye stuff," she says. "We had
a bit of reggae, so I've always loved Bob Marley." She acknowledged
Marley's impact Wednesday with a stripped-down reading of his
"Redemption Song."</TE>
<TE>   She described Marley to the Viper Room crowd as "a guy who's
always been in my life, whose music usually came on when I was at my
lowest ebb. So I wanted to sing this now, at a time when things
couldn't get any better."</TE>

<HD>Two Is a Party for Owners</HD>
<DH>Television* Bottom lines benefit when companies have two
stations in the same city, but employees and consumer advocates are
concerned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC executives are being asked to brush up on their Spanish. Viewers
in Memphis are watching a UPN newscast produced by the local ABC
affiliate. And Dodger fans are seeing games presented with "Fox
attitude" and graphics on what was once "Very Independent" KCOP-TV.</LD>
<LD>   These moves are all part of a relatively new game in television
known as duopoly, describing a business model in which a company owns
two TV stations in the same city. Fueled by an easing of rules
governing TV ownership in 1999, the rapidly growing practice is
fraying nerves among station employees and prompting consumer
advocates to sound alarms.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, however, this media consolidation has been
occurring under the public's radar while leaving those working in
local television wondering when and where the next shoe will drop.</LD>
<TE>   Three duopolies exist in Los Angeles, with the Federal
Communications Commission this week approving Viacom's acquisition of
KCAL-TV, giving CBS' parent company control of two local TV stations
(the other being KCBS-TV) as well as several radio
stations--including AM news stations KNX (1070) and KFWB (980).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, NBC recently completed its purchase of
Spanish-language network Telemundo, meaning the company owns KNBC,
KWHY-TV and KVEA-TV (though KWHY will have to be sold to comply with
restrictions limiting ownership to two stations per city). News Corp.
also acquired KCOP last year, providing Fox's corporate parent
control of it and KTTV-TV in Los Angeles. Programs have already moved
back and forth between the stations, from "Seinfeld" reruns to Dodger
telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, KTLA-TV and the Los Angeles Times are owned by Tribune
Co., in a departure from another fading restriction that prohibited a
company from owning a newspaper and a TV station in the same market.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinking pool of owners controlling media outlets has clear
implications for the TV industry--from employees whose overlapping
jobs are being eliminated to advertisers and program distributors,
which possess less leverage in negotiating with these bulked-up
operations. It's also anticipated the rules will be further relaxed,
prompting more mergers.</TE>
<TE>   The effect on the consumer, meanwhile, remains subject to debate.
Critics argue that centralizing broadcast outlets in fewer hands
stifles competition and potentially mutes dissenting voices.</TE>
<TE>   "The question that's not being addressed directly is the whole
notion of diversity of ideas in the marketplace," said Jeff Chester,
executive director of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, a
Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   "The consolidation is all about making the goals of Madison Avenue
more viable, and I think we're going to lose a lot in the process.
It's all about consumers. It's not about citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Many broadcasters, by contrast, say an explosion of options has
largely rendered such concerns moot--and made consolidation vital if
they are to survive in an increasingly fragmented media environment.</TE>
<TE>   For all the business ramifications of duopolies, TV executives
insist viewers are not affected. If anything, they say, dual
ownership allows some channels that wouldn't be able to afford
producing local news to do so, thus benefiting the community.</TE>
<TE>   Most agree the structure helps stations reduce costs while
centralizing decision-making. KCAL General Manager Don Corsini, for
example--a market veteran who cut his teeth at KABC-TV--will now
oversee both KCBS and KCAL.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidating front-office operations is just one form the
cost-cutting can take. There has been speculation about stations
merging news assignment desks and sending one satellite truck to
events, then sharing footage. One local TV reporter who asked not to
be identified called such practices "immensely frustrating," because
fought-for exclusive stories are passed on to the sister station.</TE>
<TE>   "Just in terms of competition, you have to believe that ultimately
there's been something lost," said Rick Feldman, a former general
manager of KCOP, who worked at the station for 16 years before
leaving in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Paired stations have extra clout when it comes to buying
programming, bidding together for sitcoms, court or talk shows. Other
scenarios include attempting to expand market share by selling
advertising time jointly.</TE>
<TE>   Having two stations work in tandem also affects news personnel.
KCAL and KCBS won't compete for talent, which could deflate
salaries--especially for rank-and-file reporters, if not highly paid
anchors. "Generally, the anchors are their identity," said agent Ken
Lindner, who represents local and national news personalities and can
foresee reporters moving between stations while anchors remain
exclusive to one or the other.</TE>
<TE>   "As an agent, any time you see jobs dwindling because of resources
coming together, it's of concern," Lindner said.</TE>
<TE>   The anxiety also extends to union representatives, who see their
influence being weakened.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously concerned about the effects of any consolidation,
and our interest is to protect our members as best we can," said John
Russum, executive director of the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists' L.A. branch, which represents anchors and
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Blending KCOP and KTTV has been complicated by the fact that
KTTV's technical employees are represented by the National Assn. of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians, whereas KCOP staff is with the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The situation
is reversed in New York, and Fox is trying to negotiate a bicoastal
swap to bring employees under unified deals on each coast.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials say they are hoping station owners will seek to
boost revenues, not just slash overhead. "Their main goal is to
capture more of the market, not just to wipe us out," said Keith
Hendriks, vice president of NABET Local 53.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and Viacom declined to comment. Yet other TV station owners
say they hope duopolies can make them stronger financially and thus
better able to serve their communities.</TE>
<TE>   One example cited is Memphis, where, under duopoly ownership, the
local ABC station now produces a newscast for the previously newsless
UPN affiliate, employing different anchors but the same production
team.</TE>
<TE>   "The second station certainly gives you a way to utilize your
newsroom in a broader capacity," said Jack Sander, executive vice
president of media operations at Dallas-based Belo Corp., which owns
two stations each in Seattle; Spokane, Wash.; Tucson, Ariz.; and
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel P. O'Brien, a senior analyst at Cambridge, Mass.-based
consulting firm Forrester Research, sees companies combining
newspapers, the Internet, cable and broadcast properties to forge
regional media powerhouses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not economically viable to run these expensive operations
when you can't cover your costs anymore," he said, adding that the
suggestion that diversity is diminished "doesn't make as much sense
in this age of 24-hour cable."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most ambitious steps involve NBC and Telemundo, which
say they will expand and improve the latter's programming, especially
in regard to news.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks at Telemundo are going to have more resources than
they've ever had before," said Ramon Escobar, the MSNBC executive
overseeing integration of the two news operations. "Our focus is to
ensure that we have the best product in Spanish and in English. These
other duopolies have some other goals in mind.... Our focus is on
growth, not on consolidating for the sake of consolidating to manage
costs."</TE>
<TE>   Plans are underway to house KNBC and KVEA in the same facility,
and sources say certain NBC staffers are trying to learn enough
Spanish to provide informed input on Telemundo's affairs.</TE>
<TE>   KNBC also intends to coordinate Spanish-language coverage of the
2003 Los Angeles Marathon, and its sales department is seeking to
"put together attractive packages to include KVEA," said KNBC General
Manager Paula Madison, opening the Spanish-language market to new
sponsors. "It's that kind of synergy that makes this even better than
it would at first blush appear," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, cooperative ventures can be tricky, especially when it
comes to newspapers and television. Belo, for example, owns the
Dallas Morning News and ABC affiliate WFAA. Because the two share
news-gathering resources, the company prevents the newspaper from
critiquing WFAA programs to avoid conflict-of-interest charges.</TE>
<TE>   Watchdog groups say that is precisely the kind of situation that
concerns them. They worry that newspapers will abdicate their
traditional watchdog role in monitoring the excesses of broadcast
news.</TE>
<TE>   In a less expansive arrangement, KTLA has installed a camera in
The Times' newsroom, affording the station access to the newspaper's
staff to augment its coverage. Like many newspapers in the same
position, The Times still covers KTLA but discloses the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the financial incentives to consolidate, even television
executives concede that they harbor reservations about where further
deregulation might lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a fan of throwing all the regulations away and just
letting people go at it," said Andrew Fisher, president of Cox
Television, whose duopolies are located in San Francisco; Orlando,
Fla.; and Charlotte, N.C. "The unintended consequences of that can be
serious."</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned about all the restrictions going away," Belo's
Sander added. "There are plenty of voices ... but it's a legitimate
debate. It's one you almost have to look at market by market,
situation by situation."</TE>

<LD>   Quayle: No Problem With 'Friends'</LD>
<LD>   Former Vice President Dan Quayle says the nation's moral
climate--including lower teen pregnancy rates and greater respect for
marriage--is in far better shape than a decade ago, when he delivered
a speech criticizing the CBS sitcom "Murphy Brown" for portraying
single motherhood as "just another lifestyle choice."</LD>
<TE>   In retrospect, he told the National Press Club Thursday, he was
unhappy about the "controversy and the nonsense and outrageous
[media] coverage" of the criticism, but said he doubted that it
affected his losing bid for reelection alongside President George
H.W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Quayle, 55, went easy on Jennifer Aniston's out-of-wedlock
pregnancy on NBC's hit series "Friends," pointing out that at least
there's a father on the scene. And he even had kind words for MTV's
"The Osbournes," a real-life glimpse into the dysfunctional family of
rocker Ozzy Osbourne. The series, he said, depicts an intact family
and delivers an anti-drug message.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at [Osbourne] and how fried his brains are from taking drugs
all those years," Quayle remarked. "Everyone will say, 'I don't want
to be like that.'"</TE>
<TE>   TV Stint Unlikely, Clinton Says</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bill Clinton told National Public Radio on Friday
that, despite a recent meeting with NBC executives, the prospect of
his hosting a TV talk show is a long shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is going to happen," he said. "I'd be
surprised if it did."</TE>
<TE>   New Combatants in Celebrity Boxing</TE>
<TE>   As expected, John Wayne Bobbitt vs. Joey Buttafuoco will be the
centerpiece of "Celebrity Boxing 2," a follow-up special that Fox has
scheduled for May 22, the final night of the current rating sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Bobbitt-Buttafuoco, the bouts will include former
football star William "The Refrigerator" Perry against 7-foot-7
basketball player Manute Bol.</TE>
<TE>   Two additional matches have yet to be set, with Fox expanding the
special to 90 minutes this time around. The last hour goes opposite
the season finale of NBC's "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   The first "Celebrity Boxing," which featured Tonya Harding
sparring with Paula Jones, drew solid ratings for the network in
March, winning its time slot with 15.5 million viewers, albeit
against a "West Wing" rerun.</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   'Cats' Winds Up 21-Year Run in London</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking musical "Cats" will prowl
off the London stage for good tonight, its 21st birthday, with an
intricately choreographed mass finale featuring members of the
original cast.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Paige, Brian Blessed and Wayne Sleep, who starred in the
first "Cats," will join about 150 other former and present cast
members at the celebration at the New London Theatre, where it has
played since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   The show is the longest-running musical production, both in
London's West End and on Broadway in New York. Theater bosses
announced in January that, despite the fact that attendance was good,
it's no longer economical to continue staging such an expensive
production at the New London.</TE>

<HD>Petersen Renovation Plan Is No Lamborghini</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed renovation of the Petersen Automotive Museum is the
architectural equivalent of a Ford Taurus. Neither flamboyant nor
particularly innovative, the design will not inspire a sense of awe.
But for those whose tastes run toward the blandly dependable, the
project will most likely satisfy the museum's basic functional needs.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by Keating/Khang Architecture of Los Angeles, the
renovation project is the most recent in a long list of building
projects by Los Angeles institutions hoping to raise their cultural
profiles. With a $30-million budget, the Petersen renovation is
comparatively modest. It will add roughly 40,000 square feet to the
existing 72,600 square feet of exhibition space, providing a
street-level restaurant and a range of event spaces, from a penthouse
ballroom to a tent-like hall that will be erected atop the museum's
existing parking structure.</LD>
<LD>   Sleek and unpretentious, the simple geometric forms and taut glass
exterior--which will be layered over the building's existing
shell--are an undeniable improvement over the current museum, a
former department store whose brooding profile and cluttered
interiors make it one of the dreariest museum spaces in the city.</LD>
<TE>   But to those who love architecture, the design is also a monument
to missed opportunities. The automobile has been a central theme of
some of the century's most inspired architectural inventions. And the
Petersen project was an obvious opportunity to tap into L.A.'s car
culture ethos. The outcome, however, is a design that never touches
on such poetic possibilities, resulting in a somewhat mundane
building proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The museum stands at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax
Avenue, half a block from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The
three-story structure was designed for a Japanese retail chain in
1962 by Welton Becket and Associates, a respected corporate firm that
was then known for its clean Modernist aesthetic. The museum bought
the space in 1992 and, with minimal alterations, converted it for its
current role.</TE>
<TE>   The new design literally envelops the existing structure in a
series of new forms and functions. A glass curtain wall will be
erected over the building's concrete facades along Wilshire and
Fairfax, giving the building a sleeker high-tech look. An expanded
fourth floor, which will contain the museum's ballroom, will be built
on top of the existing structure and will be framed by balconies on
two sides. A second event space will be housed in a low, faceted,
tent-like form set on top of the existing parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   The new Wilshire Boulevard facade is intended to give the building
a more muscular public presence, and it succeeds to a certain degree.
In the current version of the design, escalators climb the facade's
interior, a slot-like atrium that acts as a sort of display case for
internal circulation. (The architects are considering moving the
escalators to the building's Fairfax Avenue side, which would make
the Wilshire facade nothing more than a decorative gesture.)</TE>
<TE>   But the building's real public face is along Fairfax. There, the
glass curtain wall will extend along the building's surface, its
southern edge folding back to enclose a second atrium that tilts
dramatically over a small courtyard that will serve as outdoor
seating for the restaurant. The effect is slightly more dynamic, and
the presence of the restaurant creates a more inviting experience at
street level.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to draw people back to the museum's main entry, which
will be situated just to the right of the restaurant, flanked by the
museum building on one side and the parking structure on the other.
The design transforms what is now a dark, claustrophobic space into a
broad, open-air porte-cochere. Visitors will enter the parking lot
from Fairfax and proceed to the museum through an open-air court,
with light spilling down through a cylindrical light well.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of clarity extends into the exhibition spaces, which are
generous. A small gift shop will flank the entry. The
offices--currently scattered throughout the second and third
floors--will be moved to basement level. By setting the escalators
along one of the two facades, the architects are able to free more
interior space and give visitors a visual clue about how to move
through the building.</TE>
<TE>   It is the event spaces that dominate the design. The fourth-floor
ballroom is the kind of large, flexible and banal space that one
could find in any conventional hotel. Its single positive feature is
its balconies, which offer a sweeping view of the Hollywood Hills
and, one day, the Rem Koolhaas- designed Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, which is in planning stages.</TE>
<TE>   The tent-like event space is slightly more promising. In a general
sense, it is an obvious nod to Koolhaas' LACMA design, a taut,
high-tech tent-like structure, propped on slender columns above a
public plaza, that will house the museum's collections. But although
Koolhaas' structural pyrotechnics are part of a cohesive--even
revolutionary--plan to re-imagine the entire museum experience,
Keating/Khang's version is less rooted in a clear conceptual approach
to that museum's function.</TE>
<TE>   To the early Modernists, for example, the car represented the
coming of a new mass production age, one that would function with the
efficiency and speed of the assembly line. Projects like the 1923
Lingotto factory in Turin, Italy, embodied those values. Its long,
low form was anchored at each end by an elliptical ramp that led up
to a swooping rooftop test track. Frank Lloyd Wright's unbuilt 1925
Gordon Strong Automobile Objective building was designed as a
towering, truncated cone, with twin spiraling ramps for cars and
pedestrians that led up to a 360-degree viewing deck. The idea was to
make the car a central component of the architectural experience.</TE>
<TE>   Today, both projects remain compelling visions of 20th century
design.</TE>
<TE>   The design for the new Petersen Museum ignores that vision. For a
museum that houses cars, it is remarkably static and dull. The
exhibition spaces could just as well house soup cans as models of
automotive engineering.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, given the limited budget, it may have been asking too
much to expect an architectural tour de force. Still, the project is
a missed opportunity in more ways than one. Los Angeles is ripe with
young, budding architectural talents who could have used such a
commission to test new ideas. Many of these architects are updating
the old machine aesthetic for a new age.</TE>
<TE>   The museum could have plucked one and offered the opportunity to
create a building that tapped into the city's youth culture with a
more accessible language that embraced the car more fully.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Los Angeles is the city that revolves around a car
culture. What we need is an emblem for a city in perpetual motion,
not a monument to creative gridlock.</TE>

<HD>Taking Blandness to the (Speed) Limit</HD>
<DH>New sculptures along Santa Monica Boulevard in West
Hollywood look best at driving speed. Just don't get stuck in
traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not worth getting in a car and driving across town to see the
seven sculptures the city of West Hollywood has commissioned and
installed along Santa Monica Boulevard. But if you happen to be
traveling down the recently renovated street, the silly works that
make up the "Edges and Hedges" project provide a few moments of
diversion.</LD>
<LD>   Designed to be seen at the speed of traffic, these temporary
pieces are not meant to be contemplated the way art in galleries or
museums is. And if you don't give them a second thought, they'll fade
into the background of a generically pleasant experience.</LD>
<LD>   But if you get stuck in traffic, you'll have plenty of time to
think about how they aid in the transformation of this stretch of
West Hollywood into a drive-through mall, a complete shopping
experience whose every detail is beginning to feel as if it's the
result of some corporate study about enhancing blandness and creating
an atmosphere that hastens the disposal of your disposable income. As
for the art, it's innocuous, poorly designed and constructed in such
a rudimentary fashion that it borders on being crude.</LD>
<TE>   Doheny Drive marks West Hollywood's border with Beverly Hills, and
the first piece you see traveling east is a 1959 Pontiac StarChief
convertible that Seattle artists Laura Haddad and Thomas Drugan have
transformed into a planter. Parked on the median, the badly painted
vehicle conjures images of traffic moving so slowly that a lot more
than moss has begun to grow on the cars. Screaming "stop and smell
the flowers," their recycled gas guzzler is also a flowery revenge
fantasy, a 3-D image of organic matter reclaiming an icon of American
mobility.</TE>
<TE>   Two hundred feet down the road stands a 6-foot-tall table and six
mismatched chairs made of welded metal. Plastic flowers and real
cacti cover half of Keith Sklar's giant dining room set, which
resembles a low-budget float abandoned by its fabricators. Like the
comfy chairs and sofas that are arranged in tasteful clusters in the
corridors of the Beverly Center, the L.A. painter's dysfunctional
furniture reveals how domesticated so-called public space is
becoming.</TE>
<TE>   No well-meaning art project would be complete without a token of
wilder times gone by. Michael Stutz's giant coyote, made of
interwoven strips of lacquered cardboard, serves this function.
Loping along the median near the intersection of Palm, the aloof
scavenger appears to be unimpressed with the trappings of
civilization that surround him.</TE>
<TE>   The opposite end of the nature-culture spectrum is represented by
Sheila Klein's hefty earrings, which hang from the fronds of three
palm trees where Croft Street, Holloway Drive and Santa Monica
Boulevard meet. The sentiment that inspired the artist from
Washington state to dress up the trees mimics the city's desire to
dress up the street with a handsomely manicured median.
Unfortunately, Klein's elephantine jewelry pales in comparison with
the Christmas ornaments it recalls. Its tacky glamour makes her work
look cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Just across the intersection, on the north side of the street,
L.A. artist Blue McRight has installed an industrial-strength lawn
chair. The project's solitary concession to pedestrians, in that you
can actually use it, her steel and Astroturf chaise longue is wide
enough for a couple. It's perfect for people, both tourists and
locals, who like to make a spectacle of themselves. Such posing may
be a cliche about narcissistic Angelenos, but that doesn't make it
any less pathetic or depressing.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Odland's "Tonic" requires passersby to get out of their
cars. Installed behind the bus stop at the southeast corner of San
Vicente and Santa Monica boulevards, its primary audience is bus
riders.</TE>
<TE>   The New York artist's piece consists of a pair of audio speakers
hidden in two cement blocks mounted on the sidewalk. Hidden
microphones pick up street noise, and a computer transforms it into a
rumbling melody with a poppy beat. A bit rambunctious for an office
elevator, Odland's agreeable music is a marked improvement on the
sounds of buses braking and accelerating.</TE>
<TE>   About a mile to the east, in front of the new West Hollywood
Community Center at Plummer Park, is a sprawling abstract sculpture
by Stephen Glassman. Made of long sections of bamboo that have been
lashed together with rope, the spindly structure embodies some of the
taut, utilitarian elegance of low-tech sailboats from the South
Pacific. Unfortunately it also appears to be the watered-down
offspring of a Modernist sculpture from the 1970s or a section of
construction scaffolding from Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, the works that make up "Edges and Hedges" are too
cutesy and clever to be much more than gimmicks. They have the
presence of afterthoughts, incidental extras tacked on to show how
perky a street can be. When art enters the picture only after it has
been recommended by consultants and approved by government
committees, it's almost always out of touch with the vital street
life it pretends to represent. The process is akin to forming a
regulatory commission to ensure that people are spontaneously
enjoying themselves. It's a no-win situation.</TE>

<HD>He Composed Dreams of Urban and Middle America</HD>
<DH>In his 60-year career, Broadway's Richard Rodgers went from
sophisticated songwriter to mainstream hit maker to something less
than that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His music wasn't jazzy, like George Gershwin's, or sexually charged,
like Cole Porter's, or steeped in the blues, like Harold Arlen's.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't rouse Americans to war, like George M. Cohan's, or
otherwise exult in the red, white and blue, like Irving Berlin's.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the music of Richard Rodgers, whose centennial will be
celebrated around the world on June 28, said more about the yearnings
of Middle America--or at least a mythic, pre-Vietnam War
America--than tunes by most of his songwriting peers. For Rodgers,
who gave the world the darkly urban musical "Pal Joey" (lyrics by
Lorenz Hart) and the unabashedly sentimental "Oklahoma!" (lyrics by
Oscar Hammerstein II), understood the rhythms of big-city life as
well as the folklore of the wide-open West.</LD>
<TE>   More than any other Broadway tunesmith, he captured both facets of
Americana in song, his 1,000-plus tunes making him something of a
national icon, albeit a flawed one. For during a career that
stretched nearly 60 years, Rodgers reinvented himself more than once,
evolving from sophisticated songwriter to mainstream hit maker to
peddler of treacle.</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, Rodgers spent most of his career working with
two very different lyricists and recast his art to suit each one.
Indeed, the songs he wrote with Hart and, later, with Hammerstein,
often sound as if they had been penned by two different men.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Gershwin or Arlen, whose fascination with black jazz and
Yiddish folklore permeated their work, or Jerome Kern, whose grandly
arched melodies instantly identified his tunes, Rodgers leaned toward
no single style or influence. His musical interests were too
far-reaching, too encyclopedic. Thus, "any attempt to reduce his
style to a formula is doomed," critic Winthrop Sergeant once
succinctly observed.</TE>
<TE>   Having come of age in New York at the dawn of the 20th century,
Rodgers grew up amid a dizzying array of music. Viennese waltzes,
Tchaikovsky concertos, Bizet operas, Kern musicals, ragtime piano
players, street-corner vocal quartets--the whole glorious cacophony
of fast-moving Manhattan played out before him.</TE>
<TE>   But that was just the starting point, for Rodgers was blessed with
a mother who was an accomplished pianist and a physician father who
loved to sing. They made music integral to Rodgers' life, learning
early on that their precocious son had an uncommonly keen ear: He
played piano at age 6, composed melodies at 9 and completed his first
musical score at 15.</TE>
<TE>   Not until he teamed with Hart, in 1919, however, did Rodgers begin
writing quality songs, for Hart's bittersweet, world-weary view of
life inspired in Rodgers a sophisticated, jazz-tinged music. In tunes
such as the Charleston-inspired "The Girlfriend" and the swing-time
"Thou Swell," Rodgers and Hart followed in the wake of Gershwin, who
was among the first to link Broadway to the Jazz Age.</TE>
<TE>   With these tunes, and hundreds yet to come, Rodgers announced
himself as a sublime melodist on a par with Schubert or
Chopin--although Rodgers' tunes unfolded to a modern American beat.</TE>
<TE>   His music may not have been as easily identified as Berlin's or as
idiosyncratic as Gershwin's, but it was every bit as inspired. The
melodic ingenuity of "Isn't It Romantic," the soaring climaxes of
"With a Song in My Heart," the inexorable crescendo of "Where or
When," the hard-swing rhythms of "I Wish I Were in Love Again" and
the heady waltz of "Falling in Love With Love" came from the pen of a
man whose ideas in the late 1920s and '30s seemed inexhaustible.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was each of these tunes ingeniously constructed, but no
two sounded remotely alike.</TE>
<TE>   "He is always doing the unexpected," wrote critic Sergeant, "and
the variety of his melodic invention ... is probably greater than
that of any other Broadway composer."</TE>
<TE>   Yet to Rodgers, this uninterrupted flow of melody--often colored
by unorthodox harmony--was just another day's work.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do is not as fancy as some people may think," Rodgers
wrote. "It is simply using the medium to express emotion. If my
medium happened to be colors, I would be trying to express what I
feel in that medium.</TE>
<TE>   "Mine happens to be notes. It's a particularly potent medium,
maybe because it's the only purely abstract one.... This isn't a
question of sitting on the top of a hill and waiting for inspiration
to strike. It's work. People have said, 'You're a genius.' I say,
'No, it's my job.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet only a few Broadway composers of Rodgers' vintage--chiefly
Gershwin, Arlen and Kern--showed a genius for melody comparable to
his. Armed with talent, youth, money and ambition, Rodgers was poised
to assume the mantle of the great Gershwin, who had died in 1937, at
age 38.</TE>
<TE>   By 1940, Rodgers and Hart had broken new ground with the musical
"Pal Joey," an openly cynical show about sex and love in the Chicago
nightclub business. Songs such as "Bewitched, Bothered and
Bewildered" and "I Could Write a Book" attested anew to Rodgers' gift
for crafting intricate melodies that nevertheless sounded as natural
and colloquial as speech.</TE>
<TE>   But Hart, by then nearly drowning in alcoholism, had no interest
in working on Rodgers' next project, so the composer teamed with
Hammerstein on "Oklahoma!" in 1943. With this show, Rodgers
transformed himself into an utterly new composer, simplifying his art
for mass appeal, attaining unprecedented popularity and, alas,
leaving behind the searing work he had done with Hart.</TE>
<TE>   Although theater scholars rightly argue that "Oklahoma!" advanced
the art of the stage musical, in songwriting terms it represented a
step backward for Rodgers. There's no denying the exquisite melodic
contours of "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'," the charmingly galloping
rhythm of "The Surrey With the Fringe on Top" and the surging rush of
the title song. But these tunes were more harmonically stripped down,
rhythmically square and melodically predictable than anything from
Rodgers' collaborations with Hart. One could savor the tunefulness of
this score while acknowledging that Rodgers--nimbly adjusting to
Hammerstein's middlebrow sensibility--was aiming for a simpler, more
mainstream brand of musical entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, "Oklahoma!" was the biggest hit of Rodgers'
career to date, and with the death of Hart the same year, Rodgers'
more accomplished songwriting was forever consigned to the past.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Rodgers justly took pride in the operatic flourishes he
brought to "Carousel" (1945), particularly in its "Soliloquy," which
conveyed a breadth of emotion more commonly associated with European
opera. Yet, ultimately, the songs from this musical--as well as the
blockbusters "South Pacific" (1949) and "The King and I"
(1951)--showed Rodgers writing melodies that were catchy and clever
but also simplistic and superficial.</TE>
<TE>   "While Rodgers continued to write great songs, and even to top
himself, generally speaking I find missing that spark and daring
flair which existed in the songs he wrote with Hart," noted the great
critic of American popular song Alec Wilder. They had been all but
expunged from the music of Rodgers, who now avoided the offbeat
chords, puckishly syncopated rhythms and eccentric voicings that once
colored his music. Yet the simplicity of the new Rodgers and
Hammerstein scores made them the most successful Broadway songwriters
of the 1940s and '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Surely the young Richard Rodgers who wrote "Where or When" would
have been astonished to learn that by 1959 he would be publishing
such innocuous pap as "Edelweiss" from "The Sound of Music."</TE>
<TE>   There weren't many more indelible tunes to come, for as Rodgers
struggled to woo a public that hungered for something new (and found
it in the edgier music of Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein),
Rodgers increasingly was dwarfed by the stature of his earlier work.</TE>

<LD>Can't get Rolling Stones tickets this week via the online getAccess
program set up to give fans a shot at seats before they go on sale to
the public? Try the auction Web site EBay, which, by Friday,
contained nearly 150 offers of Stones tickets for various venues
around the country.</LD>
<LD>   Initially, the only tickets that turned up on EBay for one of the
coveted small-venue shows were for the Nov. 4 concert at the
2,200-seat Wiltern Theatre--the face value of which are $50 apiece.
More than two dozen bids on the Wiltern tickets were made in less
than 24 hours, and bidding had topped $2,000 for the pair by Friday
morning.</LD>
<LD>   The first tickets went up for auction Wednesday morning, before
they officially became available through the getAccess program
established by tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment and Sam
Goody music stores. Fans who paid a $60 annual fee to join the
early-ticket program were told they could buy a pair of tickets to
one date on the Stones' 32-city U.S. tour.</LD>
<TE>   Though the flood of orders on Wednesday caused the site to crash,
a Clear Channel official said Friday that the system was up and
running again.</TE>

<LD>"Due East" is part of Showtime's "Original Pictures for All Ages"
series of new movies, but take that designation with a large grain of
salt if you tune in at 8 p.m. Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The messages in this bathos-and-sex combo are dubious even for
ages 13 and older, despite the efforts of director Helen Shaver and
stars Robert Forster, Kate Capshaw, Clara Bryant and Cybill Shepherd.</LD>
<LD>   Written by Tricia Brock and based on books by Valerie Sayers, the
film gives teen sex and unwed teen pregnancy a romantic, candlelit
gloss. It also gets up close and personal--a tad too much so--in the
sex lives of four middle-aged adults, with scene-stealer Capshaw as a
wife who breaks out of an alcoholic haze to seduce back her straying
husband.</LD>
<TE>   At the heart of the story is Mary Faith (Bryant), a National Merit
Scholar without a social life who has sex with a soulful loner.
"Enough with all this schoolwork," he tells her as they tenderly
commune in a bubble bath. "That's not the essence of life."</TE>
<TE>   But then he's killed in a motorcycle accident and she learns she's
pregnant. She decides to keep his memory sacred by refusing to name
him as the father.</TE>
<TE>   Her lonely widower dad (the wonderfully craggy Forster) is soon in
bed with the mother (Shepherd, in good-old-gal, beer-drinking,
cigarette-smoking mode) of the man he thinks is responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Faith, meanwhile, is kicked out of school for setting a poor
moral example. She resolves to fight back and, in one silly
contrivance after another, winds up being cheered at graduation even
as she clutches her abdomen in time-honored, movie-labor tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But you knew it had to end happily. Why else would they be showing
it on Mother's Day?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hynix Semiconductor Inc. endorsed a plan to break up and sell the
company, conceding under pressure from creditors and the government
that the world's third-biggest computer memory chip maker can't
survive alone.</LD>
<LD>   Creditors had threatened to declare the Seoul-based company
bankrupt if it didn't accept the proposal, which came after its board
rejected a $3-billion takeover by Micron Technology Inc. Many
investors said the company, burdened by $5 billion in debt, would
struggle to stay afloat after creditors refused to provide fresh
loans.</LD>
<LD>   The Korean government, which also had pushed for Hynix to accept
Micron's offer, praised the move.</LD>
<TE>   Korea Exchange Bank and other Hynix creditors plan to choose
consultants by next week to review how to best divide the company,
said Kang Kyung Moon, a credit officer at the lender.</TE>
<TE>   Micron and Hynix had been in talks for more than five months when
Hynix's board rejected the offer.</TE>

<LD>Kmart Corp., the largest U.S. retailer to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, fired 12 senior managers and trimmed the number of
divisions to two as part of its bankruptcy restructuring.</LD>
<LD>   The discount retailer previously had five units, including four
geographic ones and a division for its chain of warehouse-size
stores, spokesman Steve Pagnani said.</LD>
<LD>   The restructuring follows the departure earlier this week of Gregg
Treadway, executive vice president of store operations. Treadway had
been named to his position in February.</LD>
<TE>   Pagnani said the changes weren't related to the company's
investigation into prior top management. He declined to say whether

<LD>Shareholders of toolmaker Stanley Works will vote again on whether to
reincorporate in Bermuda, the company said after a legal challenge
was filed to Thursday's election.</LD>
<LD>   The reincorporation, which would not have affected employment at
the 159-year-old, New Britain, Conn.-based company, was intended to
reduce its corporate tax burden. But employees and opponents of the
move accused the company of confusing shareholders with conflicting
advisories about the vote.</LD>
<LD>   The company, known for its black-and-yellow woodworking tools,
said Thursday that 67.2% of all shares favored the change, slightly
more than the two-thirds majority needed.</LD>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal and Treasurer Denise Nappier

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp. said its entertainment businesses, whose products include
the record-setting "Spider-Man," are worth as much as $19 billion,
sparking speculation it may sell shares in the operations.</LD>
<LD>   They are valued at $14 billion to $19 billion, said Chief
Financial Officer Robert Wiesenthal, putting a price on the assets
for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   His comments, which value them at up to 40% of Sony's market
value, were made at an analyst meeting in New York, breaking with
Sony's tradition of briefing analysts in Japan first.</LD>
<TE>   Howard Stringer, chairman and chief executive of Sony Corp. of
America, said in a conference call after Weisenthal spoke that the
group has no plans in the "foreseeable future" to sell shares in the
assets, which include the Columbia movie and music labels and
PlayStation video-game console.</TE>

<HD>Judge Cuts Damages Against Philip Morris</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oregon judge reduced a damage award against Philip Morris to the
family of a dead smoker to $100million from $150 million.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always tough to see $50million go," said Chuck Tauman, an
attorney for survivors of Michelle Schwarz, who died of lung cancer
in 1999. "It's still a substantial award, and it still accomplished
the goal to get the word out" about the company's business practices.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit tested a new legal approach, with Schwarz's relatives
claiming Philip Morris lied to smokers about the health risks
associated with low-tar products. Similar claims have been brought
across the country.</LD>
<TE>   Judge Roosevelt Robinson reduced the jury's award to the same size
as an earlier California verdict that stands as the largest
individual award against Philip Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris said it intended to appeal the reduced award.
Schwarz's family said it hadn't decided whether to challenge
Robinson's decision to reduce the award.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Philip Morris slipped 37 cents to $54.90 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>US Airways May Seek Chapter 11</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. said Friday that it would seek federal loan
guarantees because of losses incurred since Sept. 11 and would
consider filing for bankruptcy protection if it was unable to reach
cost-cutting agreements.</LD>
<LD>   The Arlington, Va.-based carrier had said it would seek the
guarantees, but had not discussed the possibility of a Chapter 11
filing.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 6 U.S. airline had cash reserves of $561 million at the
end of the first quarter but has been burning about $3.5 million a
day.</LD>
<TE>   "The preferred path is a consensual agreement with our employees
and our stakeholders to reach an agreement and to file [a loan]
application," airline spokesman Dave Castelveter said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the second major U.S. carrier to apply for loan
guarantees under the $15-billion federal airline bailout approved
after the terrorist attacks. America West Holdings Corp.'s America
West Airlines was the first.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways stock fell $1.35, or 27%, to $3.60 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Partner Denies Orders to Shred</HD>
<DH>Courts: Andersen exec says he never was told to get rid of
Enron-related e-mails and documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A partner with accounting firm Arthur Andersen testified Friday that
he didn't consider another partner's presentation of the firm's
document-retention policy last October as an instruction to shred
Enron Corp.-related documents.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Bass, a Houston-based Andersen partner whose criticism of
Enron's accounting prompted Enron officials to push to get him barred
from consulting with Enron auditors earlier last year, said another
local Andersen partner, Mike Odom, discussed the policy during an
Oct. 10 continuing education meeting for the firm's workers.</LD>
<LD>   That was two days before in-house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple
sent Odom an e-mail from the firm's Chicago headquarters reminding
workers of the policy.</LD>
<TE>   "He did talk about e-mails and stuff like that, but I don't recall
the entire presentation," Bass said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bass said no one suggested he get rid of e-mails and
other documentation of his disapproval of some accounting approaches
that fueled Enron's descent into bankruptcy last year.</TE>
<TE>   Temple invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination
via mail Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In January, she told Congress: "I never counseled any shredding or
destruction of documents. I only wish that someone would have raised
the question." The Justice Department since has told her she is a
target in their investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The firm is on trial for obstruction of justice for shredding
documents and deleting computer records related to Enron audits in
October and November as the Securities and Exchange Commission
investigated the energy company's finances. Andersen says no one
intentionally destroyed Enron-related documents to keep them out of
the hands of the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the jury's presence Friday, tension between prosecutors
and defense attorneys erupted over questions and comments made within
the jury's earshot.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Sam Buell complained in a bench conference
that Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin repeatedly has tried to inject
support of the firm's defense in his questioning of witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Buell said prosecutors were tired of "getting up all the time" to
object to Hardin's questions. Hardin said prosecutors "were like
little jumping beans" and he had "never seen lawyers whine like
[Buell] just did at the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon refused Hardin's
request that attorneys for David Duncan turn over their notes of his
meetings with federal prosecutors before he pleaded guilty April 9 to
directing shredding. Duncan, who is expected to testify next week,
was Andersen's lead auditor for Enron until he was fired Jan. 15.</TE>

<HD>Berkshire Hathaway's Profit Rises 51%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Berkshire Hathaway Inc., controlled by billionaire investor Warren
Buffett, said first-quarter profit rose 51% as it boosted prices at
its insurance businesses.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $916 million, or $598 a share, from $606
million, or $397, a year ago. Earnings per share, excluding gains
from sales of securities, were $534, compared with estimates of
$446.50 in an analyst survey by Thomson Financial/First Call.
Investment gains fell to $98 million from $144 million a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Berkshire's insurance operations--including General Re Corp., the
third-largest reinsurer, and Geico Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. car
insurer--posted a $20-million underwriting profit in the first
quarter as they raised prices and had lower-than-expected claims,
Buffett said earlier this week. General Re's $88-million underwriting
loss narrowed from $126 million.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd be much happier if there weren't an underwriting loss at
General Re," said Peter "Tony" Russ, a money manager at Value
Architects, which manages $85million and owns about $20 million of
Berkshire shares.</TE>
<TE>   The first quarter had the lowest amount of catastrophe losses for
insurers in 20 years, Russ said.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire had underwriting losses of more than $3 billion since
paying $17 billion for General Re in December 1998. Buffett has said
General Re paid a price for allowing its underwriting discipline to
erode in the face of price competition.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Berkshire reached a 52-week high of $76,000, before
falling $200 to $75,700 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday
before the announcement.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Jobless Rate Eases to 6.4% in April</HD>
<DH>Employment: Although the state lost 5,300 jobs on recovery
concerns, economists are upbeat. L.A. County fares worse than
average.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's job machine continued to sputter in April as employers
skeptical about the strength of the economic recovery reduced their
payrolls by 5,300 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained
essentially flat.</LD>
<LD>   Figures from the California Employment Development Department
showed the state's unemployment rate eased last month to 6.4% from a
revised 6.5% in March. The numbers were welcome news to some
economists, who had been expecting the state's unemployment rate to
rise.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, government statistics showed the nation's jobless rate
spiked to a nearly eight-year high of 6% in April. A year ago, the
U.S. unemployment rate was 4.5%, while California's stood at 5%--a
gap that California has since narrowed.</LD>
<TE>   "On the positive side, California is doing slightly better than
the U.S. as a whole," said Kei Matsuda, chief economist with Union
Bank of California. "But we're not seeing much improvement in the
[payroll] numbers. We seem to be moving sideways."</TE>
<TE>   That's because companies remain reluctant to hire many workers
until the fledgling recovery gains momentum. Matsuda and others say
the state's job trend probably will be flat over the next several
months. A short, shallow recession has led to an anemic recovery
lacking the vigor of previous rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still waiting for liftoff," said Ted Gibson, formerly the
state's chief economist and now a senior economic advisor with
MetWest Financial, a Los Angeles-based financial services firm. The
job numbers "don't signal a surging recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Southern California continued to post some of the lowest
unemployment rates in the state. Orange County's April jobless rate
slid to 3.7% from 3.8% in March, while San Diego's showed a similar
dip to 3.8% in April from 3.9% a month earlier. Unemployment in the
Riverside-San Bernardino area was 5.2%, down from 5.3% in March.
Ventura County posted an April jobless rate of 4.4%, down from 4.7%
the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves Los Angeles County as the Southland's weakest link.
Although its unemployment rate ebbed slightly to 6.8% in April from a
revised 6.9% in March, the county still has nearly 71,000 fewer
payroll jobs than it did a year ago. Los Angeles' textile and
aerospace manufacturers have struggled, along with its motion picture
industry. In addition, a lack of open space has severely limited new
housing and commercial projects--and the construction jobs that
accompany such development.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, employment gains and losses were little changed over
the month. Industries showing the strongest growth included wholesale
and retail trade, which added 6,200 jobs, followed by 4,900 new
government jobs and 900 additional positions in finance, insurance
and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   But those gains were more than offset by losses in manufacturing,
mining, construction, services, transportation and public utilities.
The long-suffering manufacturing sector once again topped the list of
losers, with 6,500 job cuts in April.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic equipment was one of the biggest culprits dragging down
the manufacturing sector, a sign of continued weakness in the state's
critical high-tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology turnaround is still a long way off," Matsuda said.
"That's bad news for California as a whole but especially for the Bay
Area."</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment figures reflect it. Santa Clara County, the
epicenter of Silicon Valley, posted a jobless rate of 7.4% in April.
That's down slightly from March's 7.6% but up sharply from the 2.7%
rate posted in April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts don't expect orders for high-tech equipment and
other capital goods to improve substantially until late 2002 or even
2003. Even when orders do pick up, many companies won't be hiring
additional workers right away.</TE>
<TE>   Take Prompt Machine Products Inc. for example. Slow sales at the
Chatsworth-based machine shop forced owner Mark Wilkinson to cut back
the hours of his 15 workers. He expects business to pick up later
this year, but not the number of names on his payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "My first priority will be putting everyone back on a full
[40-hour] schedule," Wilkinson said. "I won't be hiring anyone new
this year."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the sizzling 8.6% first-quarter U.S. productivity figure
reported earlier this year may bode well for the nation's long-term
standard of living, but it won't do much to improve the short-term
employment picture.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers can increase output without increasing the number of
workers," economist Matsuda said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, April's report showed some early signs of what could
develop into stronger job growth for California down the road. The
hard-hit temporary help sector added 3,300 jobs in April after six
straight months of decline. Temps are considered a bellwether for the
larger labor market since they typically are the first to be cut in a
downturn and among the first to be hired back when orders start
rolling in.</TE>
<TE>   Darin Meadows, Los Angeles area manager for Manpower Inc., one of
the nation's largest temporary staffing companies, said first-quarter
sales for his region are up about 20% compared with a dismal final
quarter in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He said many companies like the flexibility of hiring temporary
help, particularly at the start of a recovery, just in case business
slows down again.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to go through the hiring process only to lay someone
off right away," Meadows said.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate for California's Latino workers rose to 7.5%
in April from 7.3% in March. The black jobless rate likewise
increased to 10.1% from 9.7% the previous month.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo boasted the lowest April unemployment rate of all
California counties at 2.9%. Imperial County was the highest at
16.2%.</TE>

<HD>DaVita May Kill Tender Offer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaVita Inc. shares sank Friday after the Torrance-based operator of
dialysis centers said it may cancel a tender offer for 24% of its
stock.</LD>
<LD>   The company's shares closed at $20.40, down $1.95, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The tender offer, which expires May 17, is priced
from $22 to $26 a share.</LD>
<LD>   DaVita had been trading in the $25 range until Wednesday, when it
disclosed it received a subpoena from the Department of Health and
Human Services. The company said the subpoena, from the department's
Philadelphia office, demanded financial and billing records back to
May 1996.</LD>
<TE>   The firm's chief executive, Kent J. Thiry, said Friday in a
conference call with analysts, that the subpoena was "very broad" and
"asks for a wide range of documents" pertaining to pharmaceuticals,
diagnostic work, laboratory testing and DaVita's financial
relationships with drug companies and physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Thiry said the subpoena was "significant bad news."</TE>
<TE>   "The government will probably be very aggressive, and dealing with
it will be very time-consuming and expensive for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation could take as long as four years and cost the
company $6 million to $12 million a year, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Will they allege we should have done something differently? It is
hard to imagine otherwise," Thiry said. "Will they find a pattern of
wrongdoing? No."</TE>
<TE>   Thiry said the subpoena probably was related to a February 2001
request for documents from the U.S. attorney's office in
Philadelphia. That office is investigating Medicare billings for
services not performed and incentive payments to doctors for patient
referrals.</TE>
<TE>   Thiry, who joined the company in October 1999, said DaVita has
been cooperating with investigators and will continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it was weighing its options on the tender offer. It
could complete the offer, terminate it or reduce the offering price
range.</TE>
<TE>   DaVita operates 495 centers in 32 states, including 81 centers in
California. Medicare accounts for 52% of its dialysis revenue.</TE>
<TE>   DaVita's rivals also have come under scrutiny. Gambro, a Swedish
company, said last year that it received a subpoena from the Justice
Department for "very broad information."</TE>
<TE>   Another competitor, Fresenius, paid $486 million in 2000 to settle
government charges that its National Medical Care unit paid doctors
kickbacks and overbilled Medicare before the German company bought
the business from W.R. Grace &amp; Co. in 1996.</TE>

<DH>'Star Wars' breaks new ground in fully digital movie
making.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it good, call it bad, but don't call "Star Wars: Episode II
Attack of the Clones" a film.</LD>
<LD>   Breaking new ground for major motion pictures, "Attack of the
Clones" was shot entirely with digital cameras, edited with digital
equipment and, for a few dozen theaters, will be distributed and
projected digitally. That approach, some industry executives believe,
heralds the future of Hollywood and the death of actual "film"
making.</LD>
<LD>   The technological evolution has sparked something of a religious
war among directors and crews over the artistic merits of high-tech
cameras and projectors. But the electronic methods can save a
budget-conscious studio millions of dollars, as well as lower the
barriers to entry for new talent.</LD>
<TE>   Independent filmmakers are making the leap first, with a few major
studios, most notably Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. and 20th Century
Fox, starting to distribute features digitally.</TE>
<TE>   Even this month's Cannes Film Festival, the world's premier
showcase for filmmakers, is making room for digital productions.
Festival organizers have installed several digital projectors this
year, enabling digital screenings of "Attack of the Clones" and a few
other pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The Cannes screenings could have a catalytic effect on the
industry, said Peter Broderick, president of Next Wave Films, a unit
of Independent Film Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly if people see it and are impressed ... it has to make
people realize it's not a question of when digital's going to be good
enough in terms of production and exhibition," Broderick said. "It's
already good enough and in fact may create opportunities,
possibilities for making movies in different, more cost-effective
ways, that people at all budget levels need to explore and consider."</TE>
<TE>   The new technology's payoff for moviegoers is likely to be a
greater choice of films, more consistent quality in theaters and
potentially more dazzling visuals. It also threatens to displace
entire segments of the movie industry--the labs that develop
16-millimeter and 35-millimeter film, for example--as well as
providing a new source for pirates.</TE>
<TE>   No one expects the industry to be transformed quickly. Although a
growing number of independent films are being shot with digital
cameras, no major Hollywood studio has bankrolled a digital
production yet, said Larry Thorpe, senior vice president of content
creation systems at Sony Electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, significant hurdles still block movie distributors from
transmitting movies to theaters as computer files and displaying them
with digital projectors. In addition to an ongoing debate about
picture quality, key standards have yet to be set for digital movie
files, and no one has come up with a business model that all the
studios and theater owners can accept, said M. Kenneth Suddleson, an
entertainment industry attorney and former studio executive.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest roadblock is the huge cost of converting a theater to
digital, including as much as $150,000 per screen for a digital
projector and more than $20,000 per screen for the computer that
stores and feeds the movies. For a big chain such as Regal
Entertainment Group, which has more than 5,800 screens, the bill
could exceed half a billion dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Though studios would save up to $1 billion in the U.S. alone by
replacing film with digital files, theaters would benefit in more
subtle ways: Digital projectors can be operated and maintained with
fewer employees, and they can be used for more types of programming.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the studios will have to come up with a way to share
the cost of equipping theaters for digital, Suddleson said. But given
the investment required to convert to digital, consumers probably
won't see any drop in the price of tickets.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 theaters in the United States and Canada will show
"Attack of the Clones" in digital, the way writer-director George
Lucas intended. That's a tiny fraction of the thousands of cinemas
carrying the movie, but it still dwarfs the number that displayed
Lucas' previous installment digitally: four.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas was the first filmmaker to use Sony's high-definition
digital camera, which captures images as bits of data on a
videocassette instead of burning images onto film. "He was, in fact,
the one who nudged us to actually take the plunge to build the
systems," Thorpe said.</TE>
<TE>   The main advantages of digital cameras, Thorpe said, include the
ability to review a scene immediately after it's shot, rather than
having to wait a day or more for the film to be developed. Filmmakers
can work faster, integrate special effects earlier and work more
creatively with images while they're on the set, Thorpe said.</TE>
<TE>   By replacing film in the cameras with videotape and speeding the
flow of work, Lucas saved at least $3 million in production costs,
producer Rick McCallum said. That's a small fraction of the movie's
$100-million budget, but "when you're financing it yourself, and
you're financing the marketing, anything you can do to be more
cost-efficient helps," McCallum said.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas was motivated to use digital cameras because his movies are
so dependent on computer-generated effects. With film cameras, Lucas
had to develop the film, convert the images to digital on computers,
add the special effects, then convert back to film. Digital cameras,
by contrast, can feed their images directly to computers.</TE>
<TE>   The process proved to be harder than it sounds. It was up to
Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Lucas' visual effects company, to figure
out how to make much of that connection between the camera and
computer work. Although it was far less expensive to shoot on
digital, said Andy Hendrickson, ILM senior technology officer for
ILM, "what we didn't take into account was the cost and time of
building the post-production processes. It was an unknown science."</TE>
<TE>   Problems cropped up nearly immediately, starting with data
management. Every day, as Lucas would wrap up the shoot, crew members
would transfer the digital images into a massive computer database
stored at ILM's San Rafael, Calif., offices.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, millions of images cluttered the database. Trying to
find a specific scene--such as the fight sequence between Yoda and
the evil Count Dooku--became impossible, as no software existed to
guide visual effects workers through the electronic files.</TE>
<TE>   ILM engineers eventually cobbled together software that helped
workers locate not only a particular scene but also a specific
image--a feat that would be extremely hard to replicate with film.</TE>
<TE>   The final version of "Attack of the Clones" will be transferred to
film and shipped to thousands of theaters worldwide. The ones with
digital projectors will receive it as a digital file, either via
satellite or on a dozen or more DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   The dominant technology for digital projection today is "digital
light processing" chips from Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas. Those
chips use thousands of tiny, independently moving mirrors to direct
different colors of light onto each point of a movie screen.</TE>
<TE>   Since the last "Star Wars" movie was released, TI has upgraded the
technology to deliver more shades of color and other improvements in
picture quality, said Doug Darrow, a business manager at TI.</TE>
<TE>   But there remains a big difference between film and digital: Film
tends to blur colors together around their edges, but digital
projectors don't, achieving a clarity that may strike viewers as
harsh.</TE>

<HD>Wholesale Prices Dip as Food Costs Tumble</HD>
<DH>Economy: Tame inflation data will allow the Fed to hold
interest rates steady longer, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE AVERSA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest drop in food costs in nearly three decades helped drive
down wholesale prices 0.2% in April.</LD>
<LD>   The decline in the producer price index, which measures prices
paid to factories, farms and other producers, marked a turnaround
from the sharp 1% increase in March, the Labor Department said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The index is an important gauge of inflation at the wholesale
level.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the "core" rate of
wholesale inflation nudged up 0.1% for the second straight month.</TE>
<TE>   "Inflation is the least of our economic worries both right now and
for the foreseeable future," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist with
John Hancock Financial Services Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Given April's tame readings, Federal Reserve policymakers have
leeway to keep short-term interest rates at 40-year lows to help
along the economic recovery, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Some predicted rates will remained unchanged into the fall. Others
suggested the Fed might hold off even longer.</TE>
<TE>   Citing uncertainties about the vitality of the recovery, the Fed
decided Tuesday to hold rates steady.</TE>
<TE>   For the 12 months ended April, wholesale prices fell 2%.</TE>
<TE>   Falling prices can offer some good deals for consumers. But for
companies whose product prices are going down, it means more pressure
on already pressed profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are worried about the recovery's staying power and are
reluctant to make big hiring and investment commitments, another
factor affecting the strength of the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Prices for all food items fell 3.2% in April, the biggest decrease
since June 1974. That drop reflected a record 46.5% plunge in
vegetable prices. Prices for eggs, fruit, pork, chicken and beef also
went down.</TE>
<TE>   A big factor behind the drop in vegetable prices was an 86.9%
decline in the cost of lettuce, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Lower prices for clothing and light trucks, including sport
utility vehicles, also contributed to the drop in overall wholesale
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing prices went down 0.7%, the biggest decline in nearly 20
years, as retailers, concerned about lackluster sales, discounted
merchandise to motivate shoppers, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Light-truck prices fell 1.4% as less-expensive imported vehicles
pressured U.S. makers to reduce prices, said Paul Taylor, chief
economist at the National Automobile Dealers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Energy prices moderated. After rising 5.5%--a jump largely
responsible for pushing overall wholesale prices up sharply in
March--energy prices increased 2.5% in April.</TE>

<HD>E-Trade CEO Gives Back $21 Million</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief executive of E-Trade Group Inc., the online brokerage and
financial services company, is giving back $21 million in 2001
compensation after his hefty salary raised eyebrows on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Even after the capitulation, however, Christos Cotsakos still will
be one of the highest-paid financial services executives.</LD>
<LD>   He will have received nearly $60million for his work last year,
far more than chief executives at blue-chip firms such as Goldman
Sachs Group and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Shareholders have registered their discontent by selling E-Trade
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., company have fallen about 18%
since the announcement April 30 of Cotsakos' original 2001
compensation of nearly $80 million. The stock fell 17 cents to $5.95
in New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are clearly in a difficult economic environment, and investors
clearly reacted to this," E-Trade President Mitch Caplan said. "And
we wanted to make sure that we got our message out loud and clear
that we heard investors and were responding to their concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos, 53, is returning $15million in restricted stock and
$6million that E-Trade had contributed to his retirement plan. The
company also had repaid a $15-million loan as part of his pay
package.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade said Friday that Cotsakos signed a contract for the next
two years that provides an annual bonus based on the company's
performance, but no base salary.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos, who owns about $105million in E-Trade stock, or nearly
5% of the company, received a base salary of nearly $798,000 and a
bonus of $4.1 million in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Another Week, Another Decline</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Despite Wednesday's big rally, a tech-led
sell-off signals investors aren't sold on a recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street stumbled to another losing week Friday, completing a
sharp reversal of fortune as the major U.S. stock indexes gave up
most of their remaining gains from Wednesday's epic rally.</LD>
<LD>   Tech and telecom stocks were pummeled in Friday's slide, which
knocked the Nasdaq composite index down 3% en route to its
third-straight losing week.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq fell 49.64 points to 1,600.85; the Dow Jones industrial
average lost 97.50 points, or 1%, falling below 10,000 again, to
9,939.92; and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 1.7% as two
days of selling followed the huge rally that lifted Nasdaq nearly 8%
on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   For the week, Nasdaq lost 0.8%, the Dow 0.7% and the S&amp;P 1.7%.
Even smaller stocks, one of the market's few strong sectors this
year, took a hit this week, with the Russell 2,000 index sliding 2%.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact that the economy seems to have bottomed out,
earnings really aren't picking up yet," said Chris Orndorff, head of
equities at money manager Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He and other strategists said Wednesday's rally was fueled more by
"short covering" than by a genuine belief that strong quarterly
profit from Cisco Systems signaled a long-awaited turnaround in the
tech sector.</TE>
<TE>   In a short-covering rally, traders betting on declines rush to
hedge their positions or close them out by buying shares--a trend
that usually doesn't last.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's earnings, stemming more from cost cutting than revenue
growth, were "not nearly enough" to justify Wednesday's 24% rise in
the stock, said Louis Navellier, editor of the Blue Chip Growth
Letter, an investing newsletter. In Friday's trading, the networking
giant shed 33 cents to $15.42.</TE>
<TE>   Other heavily shorted stocks such as WorldCom also were among
Wednesday's big winners, said Banc of America Securities strategist
Thomas McManus.</TE>
<TE>   Quick, sharp rallies such as Wednesday's are typical within a bear
market, McManus said, noting that investors may have been lulled into
complacency by the decline of the previous six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's trading volume was modest, but losers led gainers by
nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The market has weakened since its March rally, with Nasdaq falling
in eight of the last nine weeks and the S&amp;P 500 in seven of the last
eight. Investors remain troubled by corporate accounting woes, Wall
Street scandals and the uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy and
company earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood is very downcast right now, and people are just really
skeptical on stocks," said Brian Pears, head of equity trading at
Victory Capital Management. "They are getting disappointed with the
fact that Wednesday didn't mean so much."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bond yields eased as investors shifted money from
equities into fixed-income vehicles. The yield on the benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note dipped to 5.12% from 5.16% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom stocks paced Friday's plunge after Standard &amp; Poor's
downgraded WorldCom's credit rating to "junk," or below investment
grade, following a similar move by Moody's. WorldCom fell 43 cents to
a new low of $1.58, Qwest Communications lost 86 cents to $5.04, and
Sprint-PCS Group sank $1.82 to $9.74.</TE>
<TE>   * Crude oil surged to an eight-month high amid fears that a
possible retaliatory strike by Israel against the Palestinians could
disrupt supply as tensions flare in the Middle East. Crude rose 31
cents to $27.99 in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   Oil stocks were mixed, however. Exxon Mobil fell 40 cents to
$38.96, and ChevronTexaco lost 32 cents to $87.95. Among drillers,
Transocean gained 83 cents to $37, and Nabors Industries rose $1.03
to $47.17.</TE>
<TE>   * The dollar continued its recent slump against the yen and euro
amid signs of a sluggish U.S. economic recovery. The dollar declined
to 127.83 yen from 128.27 on Thursday, and the euro rose to 91.4
cents from 90.9.</TE>
<TE>   * "Old-economy" stocks such as fast-food giant McDonald's and drug
heavyweight Johnson &amp; Johnson helped support the Dow on hopes these
companies can offer more stable quarterly profits. McDonald's rose 53
cents to $29.81; Johnson &amp; Johnson advanced 48 cents to $61.85.</TE>
<TE>   * The SOX semiconductor index sank 4.5% in the technology-led
sell-off. Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips,
surrendered $1.23 to $27.01. Chip equipment maker Applied Materials
slumped $1.56 to $23.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Energy traders took another hit. Reliant Resources fell $2.49 to
$12 after the it canceled a $500-million bond offering because it
failed to disclose electricity trades that may have inflated sales.
Parent Reliant Energy fell $3.15 to $21.45, and rival energy trader
Dynegy lost $1.17 to $9.88.</TE>

<HD>Confidence Expressed by Microsoft's Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Testimony wraps up in suit against software
maker brought by nine holdout states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After two months in court and more than 30 witnesses, testimony in
the Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial drew to a close Friday with the
company's lawyers voicing confidence they had put on a strong defense
against the nine states that have been pressing for harsher
penalties.</LD>
<LD>   The end of testimony in the landmark trial paves the way for the
resolution of one of the most important business cases since the
breakup of Standard Oil Co. a century ago.</LD>
<LD>   Since the start of the trial March 18, the District of Columbia,
California and eight other states have argued that tough penalties
must be assessed against Microsoft to control its monopolistic
behavior. The states want the company to be required to produce a
modular version of its Windows operating system that consumers and PC
makers can customize by replacing the Internet Explorer Web browser,
Windows Media Player and other key software with products from
rivals.</LD>
<TE>   The holdouts were unhappy with an out-of-court deal the Justice
Department reached with Microsoft in November that ended the federal
government's pursuit of the world's largest software company.</TE>
<TE>   However, Microsoft lawyers seemed confident Friday that the states
would fail in their quest.</TE>
<TE>   "We have presented what we believe is very powerful and convincing
evidence of just how ... draconian the states' proposed remedies
are," Dan K. Webb, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, told reporters
after Friday's court session.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Greene, an assistant attorney in the California attorney
general's office, saw the case as more evenly matched: "This will be
a very difficult decision for the court, but I think we have given
her [U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly] a very rich record."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officially will rest its case next week, after dealing
with several procedural matters.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly will then hear a brief oral presentation from both
sides on the enforcement of antitrust remedies.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has tentatively scheduled closing arguments for early
June and is expected to issue her final ruling on the case this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   The final testimony in the case was from University of Colorado
computer scientist John K. Bennett, a Microsoft witness who said it
would be costly for the company to make components of its flagship
Windows operating system removable and meet other state demands.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Bennett complained that a state proposal to require
Microsoft to disclose software code interfaces to manufacturers of
computer peripherals is so broad it would include "companies that
make computer cables, printer cartridges or computer tables for
people's homes."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett acknowledged, however, that it would be technically
possible to remove certain components from Windows and replace them
with competitive products that could perform a similar function.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Microsoft's confidence in its courtroom performance,
however, neither side had blockbuster moments that might give them an
upper hand in the legal dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, which called 18 witnesses, nevertheless seemed to
outmaneuver the states, which called 15 witnesses of their own. The
states' lawyers repeatedly irritated Kollar-Kotelly by trying to
introduce evidence late in the trial or evidence that the jurist
complained was not relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kollar-Kotelly has seemed to side procedurally with
Microsoft almost as much as the initial trial judge, Thomas Penfield
Jackson, sided substantively with the government in the first trial,
she has given little indication about how she might rule.</TE>
<TE>   The unresolved legal motions pending before the judge also present
a quandary. Kollar-Kotelly could, in effect, end the case without
addressing many of the finer points of software technology.</TE>
<TE>   For example, pending before Kollar-Kotelly is a Microsoft motion
claiming that the holdout states don't have legal standing to pursue
their own case after the Justice Department settled.</TE>
<TE>   In a filing last month, the Justice Department disagreed with that
assertion but, nevertheless, said the states face a high burden of
proof in seeking strong sanctions that Microsoft agreed to in its
pact with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly also has the option of trying to combine the two
proposals, perhaps accepting the negotiated deal but adding some
elements from the states' plan.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, she will hear further from both sides on the pending
motions and make final decisions on them.</TE>

<HD>Slatkin Investors Sue Bank</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pacific Capital Bancorp's Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust is accused of
knowingly participating in EarthLink Inc. co-founder's Reed Slatkin's
$593-million Ponzi scheme in a lawsuit filed by former investors.</LD>
<LD>   The nine plaintiffs, including one who lost more than $1 million,
claim that Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust aided Slatkin's plans by
allowing him to co-mingle their money with his personal funds.</LD>
<LD>   Slatkin last month pleaded guilty to orchestrating a Ponzi scheme
that solicited more than $593 million from about 800 investors. As
part of the plea, he acknowledged responsibility for at least $254
million in losses.</LD>
<TE>   "Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust lent their name and prestige to
Slatkin for the sole purpose of adding a layer of legitimacy to
Slatkin's scheme," according to the suit filed Thursday in Los
Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara-based Pacific Capital didn't immediately return a
call for comment. Pacific Capital, which has $4.12 billion in assets,
operates banks in Central California.</TE>
<TE>   The investors claim that the bank made "substantial profits on the
hundreds of millions" it held for Slatkin over 15 years. The suit,
which seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of investors,
asks for unspecified punitive damages. Slatkin investors filed a
similar suit against UnionBanCal Corp., the second-largest
California-based bank, in December. Slatkin filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last year.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Slatkin collected money from investors from 1986
to 2001, telling them he would buy securities on their behalf.
Instead, they said, Slatkin provided false statements that showed
fabricated returns and used the money to purchase cars and artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Slatkin resigned last year from the board of EarthLink, the
third-largest U.S. Internet service provider. EarthLink has said
Slatkin's activities were separate from the Atlanta-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Pacific Capital fell 99 cents to $32.95 Friday on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Employers Warned About Invalid Social Security Numbers</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Agency is trying to reduce errors, but immigrant
groups fear harassment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Social Security Administration has sent a record number of
warnings to employers that have reported incorrect employee Social
Security numbers.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to reduce errors in its system, the agency this month
sent 750,000 letters to companies throughout the United States
telling them they had reported invalid numbers, Social Security
spokeswoman Mariana Gitomer said. About 30% are in California.</LD>
<LD>   From 1937 to 2000, the last year counted, the agency received
$300billion in wage reports from employers involving 219 million
Social Security numbers that it could not match to its records, she
said.</LD>
<TE>   If the administration could not match the Social Security number
and name to its accounts, the wage reports were sent to an electronic
lost and found, where they have sat for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the agency has pursued only a small portion of those
mismatches with query letters to employers. However, in 2001, the
agency sent 11,000 letters to a select number of companies with
errors in an effort to rectify mismatches, which can shortchange
beneficiaries who don't get credit for all wages earned. For years,
the agency has been criticized for failing to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Now that a push to resolve the issue is underway, immigrant rights
advocates say they fear that undocumented workers using false Social
Security cards could face harassment or firing.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners, meanwhile, say they worry that the letters could
bring greater scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   "Many immigrants use Social Security numbers that are not their
own," said Carlos Olamendi, an Orange County restaurateur and
immigrant rights advocate. "These checks only serve to hurt
immigrants and to hurt the companies that depend on them. What it
means is that an employee needs to keep changing jobs. No one wins.
The employee loses wages; the employer has to train another
employee."</TE>
<TE>   Other immigrant advocates say some employers already are coming
down on workers whose Social Security numbers were questioned by the
agency. They allege that a hospital in Granada Hills has used the
letter to intimidate workers trying to unionize. The hospital denies
the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, businesses receiving the letters are unsure about what
they should do. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been besieged with
calls, said Theresa Brown, chamber manager of labor and immigration
policy. The chamber is recommending that the companies seek legal
counsel. The letters "are causing confusion and disruption in the
workplace," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Social Security spokeswoman Gitomer said the letters are not
intended to nab illegal immigrants, but rather to reduce the
administration's error file, which has grown exponentially. The
errors mean that employees might not get benefits owed them upon
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Employers Should Not</TE>
<TE>   Take Punitive Action</TE>
<TE>   Nor does the agency intend to share the information with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Internal Revenue
Service, she said. The letter states that employers should not use
the information to take punitive action against an employee.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these are legitimate errors and not illegal aliens,"
Gitomer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some numbers may be reported incorrectly because some women who
marry do not report their new surnames to the government, she said.
Some are clerical errors. Also, because Latinos often use two
surnames, there can be reporting problems.</TE>
<TE>   Fred LeFranc, chief operating officer of Ruby's Restaurant Group
in Newport Beach, said he received such a letter and has asked
employees to check on whether the mistakes were clerical.</TE>
<TE>   If not, he said, "I would have to terminate a worker if the
document was not proper. You don't want problems with the INS."</TE>
<TE>   But LeFranc said the letters are troublesome: "There is really no
indication what you are supposed to do about this. We inspect
documents. Our managers are trained to verify the proper documents,
but they are not experts."</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Camacho's concern is more immediate. The organizer for the
Service Employees International Union Local 399 said Granada Hills
Community Hospital has used the mismatches to intimidate housekeepers
who are trying to organize.</TE>
<TE>   "They went to workers and told them they had 24 hours to bring the
correct Social Security number or 'you're out,'" Camacho said. But he
acknowledged that no one has been fired.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas M. Wallace, the hospital's president and chief executive,
confirmed that the hospital is asking employees to deal with reports
of names and Social Security numbers not matching.</TE>
<TE>   But he said there is no effort to intimidate anyone, and suggested
that Camacho was trying to use the issue to gain votes to unionize.</TE>
<TE>   "We are treating ... all of the employees that have come up with
this equally, whether they are seeking out union representation or
not," Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Orange County affiliate of the National Human Resources
Assn., members viewed the letters as nothing more than a routine
check. Two of the dozen or so company representatives who attended an
affiliate meeting this week had received the letter, President Janet
Rhodes Randolph said.</TE>
<TE>   "They really saw this as a standard audit, an attempt by Social
Security to make sure their records are correct," she said.</TE>
<TE>   What will happen to employers who don't comply within the 60 days
stipulated in the letter is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Gitomer said her agency is relying on the good faith of the
employers to correct errors.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be sanctioned by the IRS, but so far they really
haven't," Gitomer said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS and Social Security "have different agendas. Social
Security is not out to get these people. IRS has a different agenda.
They want people to pay taxes."</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokeswoman Deborah Guajardo said her agency fines companies
$50 per incorrect name. But to fine an employer, she said the IRS
must prove the employer intended to provide the incorrect
information.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, she said, information on mismatched Social Security
numbers may not reach the IRS for 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   INS spokeswoman Lorie Haley said her agency would not act on the
letters if it had received copies. She said the agency gets regular
tips about the use of false Social Security numbers, particularly
from disgruntled co-workers, and prosecutes some undocumented
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Cards Were Created</TE>
<TE>   to Help Provide Benefits</TE>
<TE>   Immigration reform advocates complain about the lack of teamwork
among government agencies, which they say explains why there are so
many people in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   "These agencies all work for us and they do not work together,"
said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American
Immigration Forum. "It's a deliberate policy that protects employers
who want illegal employees. We have large-scale illegal immigration
because we choose not to enforce the law."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Social Security cards
now are used as proof of immigration status, although they were
created to help provide retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows this needs to make changes in our laws and policies to
address the situation," Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Enron, Wall St. Scandals Dog SEC Investor Summit</HD>
<DH>Securities: First such meeting covers options, disclosure
of risks and other topics. Watchdog group Common Cause calls for Pitt
to resign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fallout from Enron Corp.'s collapse and recent Wall Street
scandals dominated the Securities and Exchange Commission's first
investor summit, held Friday at the agency's Washington headquarters
and broadcast over the Internet and on cable television.</LD>
<LD>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, who presided over the event, has been
criticized for meeting privately last month with the chairman of
KPMG, a big accounting firm that Pitt represented as a private
securities lawyer and whose audits of Xerox Corp. are being
investigated by the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, government watchdog group Common Cause said Pitt
should resign because of "a pattern of actual and apparent conflict
of interest ... [that] undermines citizen and investor confidence."</LD>
<TE>   In a later interview on CNBC, Pitt said he would "absolutely not"
resign.</TE>
<TE>   "I will serve as long as the president has confidence in me," the
chairman said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, the other SEC commissioners and agency department heads took
only written questions from members of the sparse audience and from
people around the country using the Internet. The SEC received more
than 600 questions, many of them sent before the summit, which was
announced last week.</TE>
<TE>   The questions answered Friday covered a wide range of subjects,
including whether shareholders should get to approve company
executives' stock options and other compensation, whether mutual
funds should be required to disclose social and environmental risks
of companies whose stock they have, compensation of financial
analysts and the accuracy of companies' accounting and financial
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is planning to require mutual funds to make more frequent
disclosures of their holdings to investors, Pitt said. Such
information could make it easier for investors to monitor the
performance of their mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   The mutual fund industry opposes increasing the frequency of
portfolio disclosure beyond the twice-a-year disclosures now
required.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt questioned New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer's idea to
break up the stock research and investment banking businesses at Wall
Street firms, calling it "a very drastic remedy."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC would consider this step "only as a last resort," Pitt
said. Spitzer, who is in settlement talks with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
after an investigation of its analyst practices, has been considering
a separation of Merrill's research and banking operations. His
investigation turned up Merrill e-mails showing that analysts at the
U.S.' largest brokerage were issuing recommendations on stocks they
disparaged in private.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt is facing investor and congressional pressure to crack down
on analyst conflicts and deceptive accounting practices. But he said
Friday that Spitzer's plan may not be necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer Banks Tightening</TE>
<TE>   Loan Standards</TE>
<TE>   Significantly fewer U.S. banks tightened standards for commercial
loans in the last three months as lenders expressed less concern
about the economy, according to a Federal Reserve survey released
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed said 25% of banks charged higher premiums or demanded
stricter covenants for commercial loans, down from 45% in the
November-January period and 51% in the August-October period.</TE>
<TE>   The survey of senior loan officers shows "some further tightening
of lending standards," the Fed said. "However, the number of domestic
and foreign banking institutions that reported having tightened
standards and terms on commercial and industrial loans over the past
few months moved down considerably."</TE>
<TE>   The report comes amid continuing concern about deteriorating loan
quality during the recession that began in March 2001. During the
fourth quarter of last year, the 25 biggest U.S. banks took $2.7
billion in costs related to Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy and Argentina's
default, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Few of the survey's respondents reported that a lack of terrorism
insurance by borrowers affected their lending practices or demand
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's survey comes two weeks after a survey released by the
Bond Market Assn. reported lenders had delayed or canceled more than
$7 billion worth of commercial mortgage loans in the first quarter
because borrowers lacked terrorism insurance coverage.</TE>

<HD>Borough Plan Pushed for Ballot</HD>
<DH>Politics: In a bid to stave off secession, proposed measure
would create up to 15 zones. City Council would have to approve the
referendum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles City Council members said Friday they hope to place a
referendum on the November ballot that would create a borough system
of government as an alternative to breaking up the city through
secession measures.</LD>
<LD>   Council members Wendy Greuel and Janice Hahn, who represent areas
threatening to split off from Los Angeles, said a city charter
amendment establishing seven to 15 boroughs would address
secessionist complaints about a lack of local decision-making power.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard frequently during my campaign in knocking on doors that
the status quo is not good enough," said Greuel, who was elected to
her Van Nuys seat in March. "So I have been talking to people about
how to design a borough system that brings government back to the
people, that does a lot of what secessionists want."</LD>
<TE>   The full council would have to approve such a referendum. Council
member Tom LaBonge, who also represents a potential secession area,
said he is interested in exploring the idea. Council President Alex
Padilla said he is "more than open" to it. Most other council members
were noncommittal Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mayor James K. Hahn is the brother of council member Hahn
and has said that heading off secession is his top priority, Tim
McOsker, his chief of staff, declined to comment on the proposal,
saying he had not seen it.</TE>
<TE>   If the borough idea did end up on the ballot, it would
dramatically alter the debate in a secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the still-sketchy proposal see it as a compromise
between those who have concluded Los Angeles is too big to govern
itself and those who take pride in the city's size and influence. It
would mimic to some extent the structure used in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The borough idea is not new at City Hall. Three years ago, a
charter reform commission rejected a proposal for a borough
government. The panel opted instead for a system of neighborhood
advisory councils, which have little authority.</TE>
<TE>   But that was before secession drives in the San Fernando Valley,
harbor area and Hollywood began gathering momentum. All three are
aimed at putting a breakup bid on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Several secession leaders signed on to the breakup effort only
after the borough proposal died at the charter commission. The
charter amendment being considered by the two council members Friday
could give the city two years to come up with a system that keeps Los
Angeles whole but grants some decision-making clout to the boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario being considered, voters in each borough would
elect a president and perhaps a five-member board. The presidents
might also serve on a city council that would deal with broader
issues. The mayor's office would lose some say in local budget and
land-use matters.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative being considered would give the neighborhood
councils more authority, and otherwise leave the City Council and
mayor's office unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she would like the boroughs to also have sway in
school decisions.</TE>
<TE>   That would require a complex redrawing of Los Angeles Unified
School District boundaries to correspond with those of the boroughs,
according to political consultant John Shallman, who is working with
Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   School Board President Caprice Young said she is intrigued by the
idea. "One of our big problems is jurisdictions don't cooperate
enough," Young said. "If there were ways for the government structure
to reinforce that cooperation, that would be good."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders, however, were skeptical. Valley VOTE Chairman
Richard Close said a borough ballot measure could be viewed as "a
campaign trick to fool voters into not voting for secession."</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission is expected in the coming
weeks to decide whether to put San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and
harbor cityhood proposals on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The borough plan would compete against any secession measure,
although voters could approve both. Greuel said she has attorneys
researching what would happen in that case.</TE>
<TE>   Close said he doubted that other council members and Mayor Hahn
would back a borough system because it would dilute their authority.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the 15-member City Council would have to approve the
charter amendment by early August to qualify it for the November
ballot. The mayor could veto such a decision; a vote by 10 council
members could override a veto.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Hahn, who represents the harbor area, said she raised
the borough issue at a recent meeting of city officials who were
discussing ways to fend off the secession threat.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor had a representative at that meeting, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Wouldn't it be a great idea to not just have a "yes"
and "no" on breaking up the city,'" Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, who represents part of Hollywood, said: "You don't
dismember a great city, and Los Angeles is a great city."</TE>
<TE>   Historian and California State Librarian Kevin Starr, a longtime
proponent of a borough system, said it appears that city officials
are waking up to the real possibility of Los Angeles being split into
smaller cities. "You can't answer this with silence," he said of
secession.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, power is concentrated in the mayor and 51 council
members, but five elected borough presidents control a fraction of
the city's budget.</TE>
<TE>   The presidents are advised on land-use and zoning by community
boards, much like Los Angeles' neighborhood councils.</TE>

<LD>The city has offered to pay Northrop Grumman $500,000 if the company
brings new jobs related to the Joint Strike Fighter program to town.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council unanimously approved the offer this week in an
attempt to lure 250 of the full-time jobs that Northrop will create
over the next few years as part of the project. Northrop spokesman
Jim Hart said the firm hasn't decided where to locate the jobs.</LD>

<LD>The company planning a massive gravel mine outside Santa Clarita has
appealed to the state in an attempt to reverse Los Angeles County
supervisors' rejection of the project last month.</LD>
<LD>   Cemex, the parent company of Transit Mixed Concrete Co.,
instigated an appeal with the State Mining and Geology Board on
Wednesday. The company claims the county has "limited discretion"
over the project, which would extract 77 million tons of federally
owned sand and gravel from Soledad Canyon, and has already received
federal approval.</LD>
<LD>   The state board has 15 days to decide if it has jurisdiction.</LD>

<LD>About 1,000 more undocumented children in Orange County will be
getting free health care this spring, thanks to a consortium that
aims to bolster the patchwork of coverage offered to low-income
families.</LD>
<LD>   The consortium includes hospitals, clinics and the Encino-based
California Kids Foundation. The nonprofit group steps in where the
state's Healthy Families Program leaves off. California Kids insures
some of the estimated 200,000 children whose parents cannot qualify
for the state's new health-insurance program because they are
undocumented workers. These children don't qualify even when their
U.S.-born siblings are covered.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, where there are 15,000 to 20,000 such children,
some of the medical centers California Kids is working with are St.
Joseph's Hospital in Orange and Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian
in Newport Beach.</LD>
<TE>   "If they are going to be tomorrow's citizens, we have to make sure
they are healthy citizens," said Gwyn Perry, Hoag's director of
community medicine.</TE>
<TE>   This week the program seemed heaven sent for one family at
Children's Hospital of Orange County, another facility participating
in California Kids.</TE>
<TE>   Because the family had recently enrolled in California Kids,
Gabriel, a 27-year-old Anaheim man who asked that his last name not
be used, was able to get treatment for his 6-year-old daughter,
Gabriela, who had blood in her urine.</TE>
<TE>   "Before this, we would have done nothing," said the father, who
makes $290 a week sewing vinyl pool covers. "When she had an earache
last year, we didn't see a doctor until she was screaming, 'I can't
take it anymore.'"</TE>
<TE>   The family avoids going to clinics, where a visit and a
prescription could run $100, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Children's Hospital of Orange County, Dr. Maria Tupas checked
Gabriela's urine, and offered a coloring book along with some good
news: The girl had no serious problem, maybe just an infection. The
doctor gave the family tips about sunscreen and dental care, and
suggested Gabriela return in a year for a physical.</TE>
<TE>   Health experts say that although there are holes in the patchwork
of services for low-income families, California Kids plays an
important role in reducing a community's health costs by not only
helping children get help for immediate problems, but also by
ensuring they get care that may prevent serious adult illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Koch, executive director of the 10-year-old foundation
that serves about 19,000 children in 33 California counties, said he
hopes Orange County hospitals' participation will encourage Los
Angeles, San Diego and Sonoma counties to join.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County has become a model for what we can do in other
counties," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Koch hopes that in a better budget year, the state may consider
insuring the state's undocumented children.</TE>
<TE>   Health experts see his foundation as a solution to insuring
low-income families in the meantime. "Given our fragmented system of
getting benefits, this sort of arrangement is good," said Steven
Wallace, professor at UCLA's School of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, $320,000 in tobacco-settlement funds plus
donations from the hospitals have made it possible to enroll 5,000
undocumented children in California Kids this year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, the medical insurance is provided by Blue
Cross, dental insurance is offered by Delta Dental Care, and
prescriptions by Wellpoint. California Kids pays the claims of the
enrolled children, and in turn, the insurers waive certain fees.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes a big difference in the kids' lives, and the providers
have an interest in making it happen to keep them out of emergency
rooms," said Lucien Wulsin Jr., director of Insure the Uninsured
Project.</TE>

<HD>Scientologists Settle Suit by Ex-Member</HD>
<DH>Courts: Church pays $8.6million to man who says it nearly
drove him to suicide. Its critics hail resolution of 22-year-old case
as a great victory against its practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Church of Scientology handed over $8.6 million this week to
resolve the lawsuit of a former member who charged that the
controversial church caused him to develop bipolar disorder and
nearly drove him to suicide.</LD>
<LD>   The payment came nearly 22 years after Lawrence Wollersheim, 53,
filed his 1980 lawsuit, and nearly 16 years after a California jury
awarded him $30 million.</LD>
<LD>   In the intervening years, the award was reduced on appeal to $2.5
million and went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it was
upheld in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the $2.5 million collected 10% interest and eventually
grew to $8,674,843, which was deposited Thursday with the Los Angeles
County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials said they paid the money because they wanted to
put the matter behind them.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of Scientology hailed the payment as a momentous
event.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an absolute watershed," said Arnie Lerma, 52, an
ex-Scientologist who manages a Web site devoted to critiquing the
religion. Lerma said he hopes the award will convince other
ex-Scientologists to file their own lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In his case, Wollersheim, who joined the church in 1969 and left
it in 1980, charged that Scientology's courses and rites drove him to
a deep depression and stole his ability to think for himself.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, according to his lawsuit, he was held on a ship and
deprived of food and sleep, which caused him to develop bipolar
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Wollersheim, who lives in Nevada, said that after he left the
church, Scientologists tried to drive his novelty business into the
ground through boycotts and nonpayment on requested merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   On his Web site, www.factnet .org, Wollersheim issued a statement:
"The cult that vowed it would never pay me one thin dime has now paid
over 86 million thin dimes."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Monitor to Give Report</HD>
<DH>Police: The update, due Wednesday, will criticize delays in
efforts to curb racial profiling, city analyst says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Delays in implementing a plan to guard against racial profiling will
be criticized by a federal official monitoring Los Angeles Police
Department reforms, a city official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Council members were also told that the monitor
will find fault with efforts to audit police practices, as well as
the manner in which some LAPD officers have presented the ongoing
reform efforts to colleagues and residents.</LD>
<LD>   The preview of the third quarterly report on the progress of
reform came from Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton at a City Council
Public Safety Committee meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Deaton has been meeting with the independent monitor charged with
tracking the city's compliance with a federal consent
decree--essentially, an agreement between the city and the U.S.
Department of Justice on a blueprint for LAPD reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles began the long and costly process of complying with
the consent decree last year.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is being supervised by a federal court, but it is the
job of independent monitor Michael Cherkasky to provide the court
with regular updates. His report is due Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It was in anticipation of that filing that Deaton presented his
update to City Council members.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton cited about a dozen areas in which the monitor has raised
concerns in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, Deaton told council members that the city
remains in compliance with the overall spirit of the consent decree,
which requires "reasonable" progress toward meeting its mandates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are making tremendous strides," said Deaton's analyst
on the issue, Barbara Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   Other city officials agreed, but said the monitor's concerns show
that improvements still can be made.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Wants Change in 'Spirit'</TE>
<TE>   "My sense is that we are making good progress, but there needs to
be a broader commitment to the consent decree," said Police
Commission President Rick Caruso. The commission also recently
reviewed some of the monitor's latest findings in anticipation of the
report.</TE>
<TE>   "The city, generally speaking, has been complying with most of the
requirements, but it's more the spirit, that's what I want to see a
change in," City Councilman Jack Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The decree is made up of 187 provisions, many of which have
already been adopted by the city and the LAPD. Other reforms are not
complete, but are considered by all parties to be on schedule. In a
few areas, such as the creation of a Critical Incident Investigation
Division, the city is ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The process of storing new data being collected by LAPD officers
on the race of the people they stop was criticized by the monitor in
recent weeks, Deaton said.</TE>
<TE>   The information is intended to eventually help researchers
determine whether officers engage in racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   But because of problems with the automated system that reads the
forms, only 112,488 have been electronically recorded so far, of
378,175 collected, according to Deaton's report.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett said the city and its contractor, U.S. Data Source, were
testing revisions Friday, and hoped to soon resolve the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett said the monitor has also raised concerns about the
expertise of people staffing new LAPD audit divisions, and a training
program for LAPD supervisors on the consent decree, which he found
inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Deputy Chief Michael Bostic said the monitor had found that
the trainers were not sufficiently "enthusiastic."</TE>
<TE>   The training has since been halted.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, the monitor was unhappy that LAPD officers
joked about the reform efforts at a community meeting in a way that
he considered derogatory.</TE>

<HD>State Issues Warning on Coastal Seafood</HD>
<DH>Environment: Tests reveal high levels of the toxin domoic
acid in crabs, sardines, anchovies and bivalves caught off Los
Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State health officials Friday warned people not to eat crabs,
sardines, anchovies and bivalves such as clams and oysters caught for
sport along the coastline of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</LD>
<LD>   Testing has revealed elevated levels in those species of a toxin
called domoic acid, said Lea Brooks, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   While no one in California has been confirmed as becoming ill from
the poison, the symptoms of a mild case mimic those of the flu.</LD>
<TE>   In severe cases, people may become disoriented, experience
seizures and even die.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid is produced by sea algae, but scientists do not know
why production increases from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   It has been implicated in the deaths of pelicans and seabirds, as
well as dolphins and sea lions that have washed up on Southern
California beaches over the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid taints internal organs but not the flesh, said Mike
Hernandez, chief of the health department's seafood safety unit.</TE>
<TE>   Crab legs, for instance, would be safe to eat, he said, even if
the crab's organs are not.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of seafood isn't affected," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial dealers have been advised to sell local anchovies and
sardines only for bait, he added.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to imposing its annual mussel quarantine, the state
issued a domoic acid warning for Morro Bay last month.</TE>
<TE>   How long the warnings will be in effect is unknown.</TE>

<HD>Crabs May Signal a New El Nino</HD>
<DH>Weather: Mass beach stranding of crustaceans might be a
sign of climate change--or it might not, scientists say.</DH>

<LD>The invasion force began landing a few days ago, wave after wave of
red pelagic crabs carried by warm currents from Baja and dumped
unceremoniously on the beaches of Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   A human tendency is to view such mass stranding--or other bizarre
animal behavior--as a harbinger of rough weather or even a
cataclysmic event.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, the arrival of these thumb-length crabs is widely
reported to portend an upcoming El Nino event, with its powerful
winter storms, mudslides, home-bashing waves and mass die-offs of
marine life.</LD>
<TE>   Not so fast, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   "The mass stranding of red crabs is not sufficient evidence that
an El Nino has arrived," said Mark Ohman, a biological oceanographer
at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   These crabs, he said, sometimes show up in non-El Nino years, too.
They hitch a ride--probably involuntarily--on the warm plume of water
that on occasion works its way north from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Patzert has been tracking this warm plume, along with other
sea surface temperatures, using satellites from his station at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, he said, the state's coastline is dominated by the
California Current, a large, slow mass of water moving from north to
south. Every so often, a California countercurrent kicks in.</TE>
<TE>   "It sweeps all these crabs that are spawning, and they tend to
wash up on the beach by the millions, or at least the tens of
thousands," Patzert said. The crab swarm, he said, "can occur during
an El Nino but it doesn't take an El Nino to make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The red crabs, which look like tiny lobsters, began showing up on
beaches in San Diego last week. Their tiny bodies turned some
stretches of sand fiery red, as if a restaurant had laid out a
massive seafood spread on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so small, once they wash up on the sand, they cannot get
back in the water and they kind of die," said Jennifer Rogers, a San
Diego lifeguard. She spotted even more in the surf. "They bite you a
little bit in the water. It doesn't hurt. They just pinch."</TE>
<TE>   Crab sightings reached as far up the coast as Surfrider Beach in
Malibu, but most of the tiny crustaceans remained safely offshore. In
previous migrations, they have been spotted as far north as Eureka.</TE>
<TE>   These crabs, Pleuroncodes planipes, are sometimes called tuna
crabs after the fish that love to eat them. They are a favorite snack
of blue whales and other baleen whales.</TE>
<TE>   For the first two years of their lives, these pelagic, or
open-ocean, crabs swim freely in the water column, munching on
plankton collected in micro-hairs on their legs. Only in the third
year of life do they settle to the bottom, sometimes as deep as 300
meters.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that their primary center of breeding is off
south-central Baja California," Ohman said. That makes them an
indication of the northern movement of warmer water. But these tiny
crabs may not be playing the role humans enjoy assigning to animals.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say people should not read too much into the crabs'
sudden appearance. But then scientists tend to discount the
prescience of nervous dogs before earthquakes or, for that matter,
Punxsutawney Phil's celebrated insight into the length of winter. Red
crabs tend to show up every six to 10 years, with or without an El
Nino.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Patzert sees little evidence of a brewing El Nino, which
sends warm water surging north up the California coast from South and
Central America.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's official forecasters at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration last week noted only slightly higher than
average temperatures in tropical Pacific waters, where El Ninos are
born.</TE>
<TE>   Their prediction is that a weak or moderate El Nino event may
develop during the next six to nine months. If one does emerge, they
said, the global impacts should be less than those experienced during
the strong 1997-98 El Nino.</TE>

<HD>'Munchkin Hotel,' Culver City at Odds Over Parking Lot</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Loss of spaces may force the closure of the
historic site that housed 'Wizard of Oz' actors, its owner says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The place hasn't been part of a ruckus this big since the Munchkins
took it over 64 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But the venerable Culver Hotel is suddenly in the middle of a
dispute over a $41-million local redevelopment project that is
raising hackles in Culver City--and belly laughs across the country.</LD>
<LD>   The city has shut down a municipal parking lot used by hotel
guests to make room for a multiplex movie theater that officials hope
will attract outsiders to revitalize their struggling downtown area.</LD>
<TE>   Trouble is, the elimination of 38 parking places at the lot rented
by the hotel is chasing away the very visitors that officials are
courting with the project. And as a result, Culver City's most
recognizable landmark may close.</TE>
<TE>   Along with convenient guest parking, the redevelopment project
also has wiped out the hotel's passenger-loading zone used by taxis,
tour buses and airport limousines.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no drop-off, no temporary parking--no place to stop so
you can come inside and check if we have rooms available," said hotel
owner Joseph Guo. "They are putting us out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Since the parking lot was shut four weeks ago, Guo has repeatedly
begged officials to at least allow passenger loading in an alley next
to the hotel. The city has refused and police have begun issuing $38
tickets to drivers who stop there.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders contend there is plenty of parking for hotel guests
at a newly opened 400-space municipal parking structure. The garage
is part of Town Plaza, the redevelopment project that eventually
seeks to build new restaurants and shops in the downtown area, in
addition to the 1,850-seat movie complex.</TE>
<TE>   But Guo, 47, complains that the parking structure is unguarded at
night and is a two-block walk from the hotel for suitcase-lugging
guests. He said his patrons who try to drive to the parking area
encounter a nearly mile-long detour through a residential
neighborhood along a confusing network of newly designated one-way
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Guests say it is aggravating to be able see the distinctive,
wedge-shaped hotel from most of the downtown area but not be able to
easily reach it by car. Even the alley next to the hotel is hard to
find: Access to it is off a private driveway leading to the Culver
Studios film lot on Washington Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1924 by Culver City founder Harry Culver, the six-story
hotel at 9400 Culver Blvd. was the Westside's first "skyscraper." As
the city's film studios expanded, the 46-room hotel became popular
with movie stars. Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Buster Keaton and Clark
Gable were among celebrities who maintained part-time residences
there.</TE>
<TE>   The brick building and its marble and wood-paneled lobby were also
often included in movie scenes. Laurel and Hardy and "Our Gang"
comedies were filmed there, along with scenes from more recent
features such as "Stuart Little 2" and the TV series "7th Heaven."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel's most celebrated role was behind the scenes, though.</TE>
<TE>   In 1938, 124 midgets and dwarfs from across the country descended
on the Culver Hotel to portray Munchkins in "The Wizard of Oz." The
little actors were booked three to a bed during the movie's
production at the nearby MGM studios.</TE>
<TE>   That arrangement gave rise to rumors of debauchery and drunken
little people swinging from hotel rafters that quickly became a part
of Hollywood legend.</TE>
<TE>   Those days were conjured up again last month when the parking
lot's closure and Culver City's redevelopment plan were the butt of
jokes on a national radio talk program.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years radio host Tom Leykis has broadcast his show from
a studio near the hotel. He and others at the Westwood One radio
syndication company also parked in the lot until they were kicked
out.</TE>
<TE>   Leykis laughed at the notion that a multiplex theater will breathe
new life into Culver City's downtown--which he described for
listeners as "a bunch of low-slung buildings, under-performing
businesses, 10-minute traffic lights and parking nightmares."</TE>
<TE>   "The last time there was anything fun to do in Culver City, I
think, was the time the Munchkins stayed at the Culver Hotel and had
an orgy," Leykis scoffed on his April 10 show.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when companies that own movie theaters are going under,
with the typical foresight in Culver City they've decided to forge
ahead with a multi-screen theater here. And they think people are
going to come from outside Culver City to watch a movie here."</TE>
<TE>   City officials bristle at those comments--and at Leykis'
suggestion that the redevelopment project has led to a new civic
slogan: "Culver City: It's Not Just for Taggers Anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Carol Gross said the multiplex proposal is a sound one that
has been "evaluated a great deal" over the last nine years by
redevelopment planners.</TE>
<TE>   She said Guo's parking "needs and concerns have been under
consideration from the beginning and taken under consideration all
along" by city officials.</TE>
<TE>   As for Leykis, "I think this person, too, had convenient parking
for years. Now, somebody inconvenienced is striking back," Gross
said.</TE>
<TE>   City redevelopment administrators acknowledge that the multiplex
plan has not been without its problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some Culver City voters tried unsuccessfully in 2000 to block the
project through a ballot initiative.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the theater's proposed original developer, AMC
Entertainment, cut back on its operations because of economic
problems and pulled out of the project. The city then decided to
underwrite the construction itself, scaled back the multiplex plan
from 20 screens to 12 and recruited Pacific Theaters to operate the
cinemas as a tenant instead of as an investor.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wardlaw, Culver City's deputy community development director,
said the city has advised Guo that an automobile turnaround area and
passenger drop-off zone will be installed in a city-owned greenbelt
near the hotel as part of the theater construction next year.</TE>
<TE>   But Wardlaw warned that the city "cannot assign the use of a
public right of way" for the exclusive use of hotel patrons--meaning
moviegoers will have use of the drop-off area, too.</TE>
<TE>   Guo said he doubts that his hotel will survive until next year.</TE>
<TE>   He said tenants who rent office space in the building have already
pulled out, and irritated overnight guests have informed him they
won't return unless the parking problems are solved.</TE>
<TE>   Born in China, the Northwestern University-educated Guo said he
and his investment company purchased the then-closed hotel for $2.9
million in 1997, after being assured by the city that he could
continue to rent sufficient parking space in the adjoining municipal
lot for guests. Another $1.2 million was spent refurbishing the place
for its reopening it in 1998--in time for surviving Munchkins to
return to the hotel for a 60th-anniversary "Wizard of Oz" reunion.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Guo went to court seeking to force the city to abide by
its 1997 parking pledge. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused
to issue a temporary restraining order but set a June 10 hearing into
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   So for now Guo gazes over his gleaming but nearly empty lobby--and
at slick city brochures that brag about "bringing Main Street back"
to Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   One pamphlet touts the role the redevelopment agency has had in
turning "that vision into reality by completing such projects as
renovation of the Culver Hotel historic landmark."</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't renovate this, we did," Guo said. "Now we just want
to be able to stay in business."</TE>
<TE>   But as things now stand, keeping the Munchkins' hotel open may be
a tall order.</TE>

<HD>State to Cut 120 Beach Guards</HD>
<DH>Safety: L.A., Ventura counties could lose 12 positions
each. Orange County could lose 30.</DH>

<LD>The number of lifeguards who patrol California's 28 state beaches
will be slashed by 20% this summer to help close the state's
multibillion-dollar budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   In a year when record attendance is projected at state beaches,
the Department of Parks and Recreation will have 120 fewer guards on
duty during the busy summer season.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Friday they are still working out the details of
the cuts and won't have them ready until Gov. Gray Davis' final
budget is completed.</LD>
<TE>   "If we have six towers on a beach, we might reduce it to four and
ask people to stay in the proximity of those four," said department
spokesman Roy Stearns.</TE>
<TE>   "There's cause for concern, but not cause for alarm."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County will be the most affected, because it has the most
state beaches, six. Ten beaches in Los Angeles and Ventura counties
also face cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County beaches possibly affected are Dockweiler, Leo
Carrillo, Robert H. Meyer Memorial, Will Rogers and Malibu Lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   Most beaches will remain fully patrolled during peak weekend
hours. Fewer lifeguards will be on duty toward the end of the day,
and swimmers may be asked to move near towers that are staffed.</TE>
<TE>   Weekday lifeguard patrols will also be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Officials announced the cuts Friday to warn swimmers that they
need to be especially safe when they hit the beaches this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our message is that everybody needs to be personally aware of
their safety and their limits," Stearns said.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are aware and alert, there is no reason why anybody
should drown."</TE>
<TE>   At state beaches last year, 17 swimmers drowned and 7,400 were
rescued.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed cuts, Orange County would lose 30 lifeguards,
San Diego would have 25 fewer and Los Angeles and Ventura counties
would each be down 12 lifeguards.</TE>
<TE>   At many state beaches, lifeguards typically staff the towers until
6 p.m. but will stay late if many beachgoers are still around. Now
staffing at busy beaches in the evening will be limited to roving
patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to do our best to make sure the public doesn't notice
a reduction in lifeguard service," said Mike Tope, superintendent for
the state park system's Orange Coast District.</TE>
<TE>   Tope said there have been other cutbacks in his district.
Off-season hours at many parks have been reduced, and some overnight
campgrounds had to be closed during non-summer months.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts will be felt at state parks and recreation areas across
California. "We have 267 parks across the state," Stearns said. "We
are cutting all of them. Everybody is taking their proportionate
cut."</TE>
<TE>   Stearns said state parks had 82 million visitors last year, and 90
million are projected this year.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the increase was from beach visitors taking advantage of
discounts in day and overnight use fees, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we had a huge increase in visitorship," Stearns said.
"It required a great deal of overtime to staff our beaches. We're
still paying that bill."</TE>
<TE>   Funding is being slashed at every level of state government due to
a budget shortfall triggered by dwindling tax revenue and an increase
in refund claims at a time when state expenses are rising.</TE>

<HD>Hearing-Impaired Teenagers Are Urged to Focus on Their
Potential</HD>
<DH>Education: High school students learn what to expect in the
work force during career day event.</DH>

<LD>About 160 deaf high school students got a chance to meet college
recruiters and professionals Friday at a career day designed to
convey a simple message--they can be just about anything they want,
if they work hard enough.</LD>
<LD>   "Twenty years ago, it was more difficult for a deaf person to get
a job. But now because of the [Americans With Disabilities Act],
there are more opportunities for us," Kelly Gunderson, a recruiter
for Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., the nation's preeminent
school for the hearing-impaired, told the students. "More people are
starting to notice the deaf have real job potential."</LD>
<LD>   The teens, from the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los
Angeles, spent most of the day at the Greater Los Angeles Council on
Deafness headquarters in Eagle Rock, learning what to expect in the
work force.</LD>
<TE>   One thing they can expect is help from new technology. Computers
offering instant messaging and pagers with text messages have made it
easier for the deaf to work alongside the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're deaf or not, it doesn't matter," Gunderson said.
"You're talking to a computer."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some employers are "starting to look at the person's
skills instead of their disability," said Michelle Abounader, a
California Department of Rehabilitation counselor who works with the
deaf.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Abounader said, "so many employers are afraid to hire the
deaf because of the ADA. It takes $100 to $500 on average for ADA
compliance. There are tax incentives, so it usually balances out in
the end."</TE>
<TE>   Students were encouraged to attend college or obtain specialized
training after high school to increase their chances of landing a
good job. Fields more accommodating to the deaf include education,
psychology, mental health and vocational rehabilitation, Gunderson
said. Many deaf people end up working with youths who are also deaf
or hard of hearing, she added.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of current and former deaf college students offered advice
to the students.</TE>
<TE>   "Get involved in clubs, organizations and sports. It looks good on
your resume," said Daniel Girard, a Cal State Northridge graduate who
will soon enter Gallaudet's master's program.</TE>
<TE>   Today, from 9:30 a.m. to noon, college recruiters and financial
aid experts will be at the Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness
offices at 2222 Laverna Ave. to assist parents of deaf children. The
event is free and open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   One of Friday's workshops gave students a chance to take part in
mock job interviews. In another room, a panel of deaf
professionals--including a costume designer and story editor for a
film production company--urged the teens to aim high.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get a [college] degree so you can make an impression
on the hearing world, so they will see that you can do it," said
Susan Margolin, who teaches a variety of subjects for deaf and
hard-of-hearing students at Gardena High School.</TE>
<TE>   Zalika Hannibal, a junior at Fairfax High School who wants to be a
medical assistant, said the career fair was inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned to think positively. I can't think negatively," said
Zalika, who lost her hearing when she was 6 months old. "It's
important to be able to hear, but I think if I just pay attention,
I'll be able to do what I want."</TE>

<HD>Officers Arrest 21 in Drug Raid</HD>
<DH>Crime: Santa Paula authorities receive help from federal
agents to combat the community's growing narcotics and gang problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-one people were arrested and several pounds of drugs and
nearly a dozen stolen guns seized during a four-month undercover
operation involving Santa Paula police and federal agents,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a problem with drugs and gangs," said Police Cmdr. Mark
Hansen. "And what this project proved is there is significant
activity going on in Santa Paula."</LD>
<LD>   Police Chief Bob Gonzales said the undercover investigation was
made possible by a special team of agents from the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration, whose mission is to assist police in
drug-plagued communities. The operation ended last week, but was only
made public Friday.</LD>
<TE>   A dozen agents on the DEA's Mobile Enforcement Team slept in local
motels or commuted from the Los Angeles area each day to work with
local police.</TE>
<TE>   "They dedicated 5,600 man hours to this city. It was like adding
three cops to the streets of Santa Paula for more than three months.
It was great," Gonzales said in an interview with The Times Friday.</TE>
<TE>   While police leaders agree the amount of drugs seized won't put a
big dent in drug sales, the large number of arrests may send a
message to dealers. In all, 19 men and two boys--a majority from
three local gangs--were arrested during the secret operation that
began in January.</TE>
<TE>   "This was only the first round," the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   After contacting the federal agency for help in November, the DEA
team arrived in January and spent several weeks developing
relationships with dealers they met in local bars, through snitches
and on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   During March and April, agents used nearly $12,000 to buy more
than two pounds of cocaine, one pound each of methamphetamine and
marijuana and about five grams of heroin.</TE>
<TE>   The team served search warrants at five houses, where they made
some of the 21 arrests. During the operation, agents also bought at
least 11 stolen guns, including an automatic rifle and several
revolvers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the operation went smoothly until April 17, when agents
went to arrest 22-year-old Edward Barron on suspicion of selling
drugs out of his Santa Paula home, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities arrived at his home on Santa Barbara Street,
Barron allegedly pointed a revolver at an agent, who then shot Barron
in the head.</TE>
<TE>   He remains paralyzed, with a bullet still lodged in his brain. He
continues to be treated at Ventura County Medical Center. He has not
yet been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said all of the other suspects remain in custody on
various drug and gun charges and that their cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   He said police plan to continue working with federal and state
authorities to combat crime in his city.</TE>

<HD>Death Sentence, Conviction Overturned</HD>
<DH>Justice: Court says man accused of rape and murder was not
adequately represented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Friday reversed the conviction and death
sentence of a man found guilty of murdering, robbing and raping a
woman in Contra Costa County in 1982, ruling that his defense
attorney provided constitutionally deficient representation.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision marked the 10th time in a year that the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals has either reversed a California death
sentence or upheld the ruling of a lower federal court judge toppling
a capital sentence previously approved by the state Supreme Court.
Friday's decision was the second of the 10 cases where the verdict
also was overturned.</LD>
<LD>   The court has upheld three death sentences during the same period.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, in the case of Michael Wayne Jennings, the San
Francisco-based appeals court ruled that attorney Michael J. Oliver's
"unreasonable failure to investigate psychiatric evidence and
possible medical defenses fell below the minimal standard of
effectiveness that can be reasonably expected of defense counsel."</TE>
<TE>   While there was a wealth of circumstantial evidence that Jennings
committed the murder, the court said, Oliver failed to explore the
possibility of a mental defense that could have resulted in Jennings
being convicted of a lesser crime. If Jennings had been convicted of
second-degree murder or manslaughter, he would not have been eligible
for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the wealth of mental health and drug abuse evidence at the
ready, effective counsel almost certainly would have made an effort
to raise reasonable doubt, as to" whether Jennings had the intent
necessary to commit first-degree murder, Judge Betty B. Fletcher
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit said that Jennings, 52, should either be retried
or released.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's decision reversed a unanimous 1988 state Supreme Court
ruling and a subsequent ruling by U.S. District Judge William A.
Ingram of San Jose, who in 1999 rejected claims that Jennings' right
to a fair trial had been violated.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings' appellate attorneys, Marianne D. Bachers and Gilbert
Eisenberg of San Francisco, said Friday that they were elated. "The
9th Circuit understood that my client did not receive a fair and just
trial," Bachers said.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Gillette, a senior deputy attorney general, said he was very
disturbed by the ruling and the overall trend of reversals. He said
his office would definitely seek a rehearing before a larger panel of
9th Circuit judges.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings was convicted in 1984 of murdering Violet Newman, 63, in
her Concord home in August 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Her body, discovered by her brother-in-law after she failed to
appear at work, was unclothed except for a night hat and gloves,
according to court documents. Her wallet, checkbook and telephone
answering machine were missing.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy found 14 stab wounds to her chest and abdomen. A
carotid artery and a jugular vein were severed. There was clear
evidence of rape.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit cited several facts linking Jennings to the
murder. He had known Newman for much of his life, having lived next
door to her at his parents' home. In addition, strapping tape found
in Newman's home bearing Jennings' thumb and palm prints matched tape
found in his pickup truck. Semen consistent with Jennings' blood type
was found on Newman's body. And Jennings volunteered facts about the
crime to friends and the police that had not been made public.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver put on what the 9th Circuit described as a "very weak alibi
defense." The key issue before the appeals court was whether Oliver's
failure to investigate possible mental defenses constituted
ineffective assistance of counsel under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984
Strickland vs. Washington decision.</TE>
<TE>   That decision holds that a defendant seeking to show that his 6th
Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated must
demonstrate both that his lawyer's performance was well below
professional norms and that the deficient performance undermined
confidence in the outcome of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher, an appointee of Jimmy Carter, wrote that Oliver's
performance had been so bad that both parts of the Strickland
standard had been met. Judges Marsha S. Berzon, a Bill Clinton
appointee, and Thomas G. Nelson, a George Bush appointee, joined in
the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Among Oliver's failures, Fletcher wrote, were:</TE>
<TE>   * He did not conduct any follow-up with a psychiatrist who had
undertaken a two-hour examination of Jennings before Oliver was
appointed to handle the case.</TE>
<TE>   * He did not ask for copies of Jennings' voluminous medical
records.</TE>
<TE>   * He did not seek appointment of additional experts to evaluate
Jennings' mental state or the possible effects of methamphetamine on
Jennings, even though he knew a syringe had been found in Jennings'
car and Oliver knew his client had reported to the police that he had
been "strung out on ... crank for over a year."</TE>
<TE>   * He did not follow up on reports from Jennings' ex-wife--who was
represented by Oliver in divorce proceedings against Jennings--that
Jennings had attempted suicide by driving his car into a tree.</TE>
<TE>   * He did not investigate a previous incident--of which he had some
knowledge--in which a judge ordered Jennings committed involuntarily
for psychiatric evaluation because he appeared catatonic.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher said that Judge Ingram had misconstrued the Strickland
standard in rejecting Jennings' claims when he reviewed the case
after the state Supreme Court upheld the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not to determine whether it is possible to find a worse
attorney, but whether a particular defendant received representation
sufficient to satisfy the 6th Amendment," Fletcher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She also emphasized that as long ago as 1983, the California
Supreme Court had ruled that "a possible conflict between a
diminished capacity and an alibi defense would not excuse counsel's
failure to initially investigate the strengths of a 'mental defense'
vis-a-vis an uncorroborated alibi defense."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Fletcher wrote, even the prosecutor in Jennings' case
expressed concern to the trial judge that Oliver "had not properly
investigated substantial medical records and that the failure could
provide grounds for appeal." Oliver then assured the judge he had
fulfilled his duty, Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney who had diligently investigated the case would have
opted for a mental defense strategy, Fletcher concluded. Had Jennings
done that, "we ... find it reasonably probable that the jury--which
deliberated for two full days before rendering its guilty verdict ...
would have rendered a verdict for second-degree murder or
manslaughter, both of which were presented as options, but neither of
which was argued or supported by the case Mr. Oliver presented,"
Fletcher wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Some years after the trial, the State Bar suspended Oliver at
least twice for failing to meet his obligations to clients. And
earlier this year, the State Bar ordered him removed from active
status, according to the agency's records.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Seeks to Free 2 Americans</HD>
<DH>Prisoners: He offers to visit Israel to press for release
of an Anaheim doctor, second worker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jesse Jackson has joined a growing national campaign to free
two American medical relief workers being held in Israel on suspicion
of terrorist activities, a Jackson staff member said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a phone call to Israeli Embassy officials in Washington this
week, Jackson offered to fly to Israel to seek the release of Anaheim
physician Riad Abdelkarim and Dallas charity worker Dalell Mohmed,
said Tracy K. Rice, Los Angeles bureau chief for Jackson's Rainbow
Push Coalition. She added that Jackson was also expected to speak to
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres about the two relief workers,
who were arrested Sunday in Israel but have not yet been formally
charged with any crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, who has helped win the release of captured U.S. soldiers
in Syria and Belgrade, told Israeli Embassy official Rafael Barak
that "he was very concerned that these were two people on a relief
mission who should be allowed to return to the United States," Rice
said. She said Jackson had concluded from all the background
information that Abdelkarim is a well-respected doctor innocent of
any terrorist activities.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli authorities say they have not released evidence against
the two because of national security concerns. Both detainees are
members of the Holy Land Foundation, an Islamic relief organization
outlawed by Israel and closed down in the U.S. by federal authorities
last December on charges that it funneled money to the militant Hamas
group. Hamas has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings and
other terrorist activity.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim, however, was found to be uninvolved by the FBI, whose
agents questioned him about his Holy Land connections last fall after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Holy Land members deny any terrorist
connections and are suing the U.S. government for freezing the
organization's funds.</TE>
<TE>   Abdelkarim has started a hunger strike to protest his detention,
his brother Basil said. At the request of Israeli authorities, he has
also agreed to take a polygraph test, against the advice of his
attorney, according to Abdelkarim's congressman, Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach).</TE>

<HD>Russians Ask County for Help Handling Domestic Violence</HD>
<DH>Family: Local victim advocates will work with police and
crisis center employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Victim advocates from Ventura County and local law enforcement are
collaborating with their Russian counterparts to combat domestic
violence there.</LD>
<LD>   In June, Pat Mages of the Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual
Violence and Oxnard Police Det. Alex Rangel will travel to Russia.
Their aim is to help Russian police and crisis center workers form
their own versions of a domestic violence response team, mirroring
the partnership that exists among Oxnard police, the coalition and
the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   "The Russian government says that there are 14,000 women killed by
their husbands and other relatives each year," said Marina
Pisklakova, president of the Emerald Institute for International
Assistance. She and Tom Parker, chairman and chief executive of the
institute, applied for two State Department grants totaling $1.25
million to fund the program. Pisklakova, who is Russian and divides
her time between Moscow and the Los Angeles area, opened the first
crisis center for women in Russia in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   Parker says Ventura County was chosen for the grants because of
its success in dealing with domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in L.A. for 12 years, and was familiar with the
coalition, and law enforcement and the D.A.," he said. "Because of
their proximity and success, it was natural that we would look to
them as a partner."</TE>
<TE>   In April, representatives from Russia visited the United States.
They took a course on domestic violence at Cal Lutheran University
and learned about the history of domestic violence legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborators at Cal Lutheran also will help the institute publish
a report and a training manual to help replicate the program
throughout Russia.</TE>
<TE>   When Oxnard police get a domestic violence call, they contact
coalition staffers or volunteers, who are available around the clock
to meet them in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to find out [the victim's] needs right there," Mages said.
"Whether it's a referral or if they need help finding shelter. We
also assist with getting a protective order.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are usually the first on scene, and they're there to
investigate. We do crisis intervention and the two work well
together. The goal is to see that [the victim] and the family get out
of the cycle of violence."</TE>
<TE>   Pisklakova said that the partnerships in Russia will cater to the
cultural needs of the country, but will keep certain aspects of the
program intact.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate goal is to make crisis centers able to respond to
domestic violence immediately," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Initial response is important, Pisklakova said, because there are
not enough shelters and centers to serve all the battered women in
Russia. For instance, in Moscow, a city of about 12 million people,
there are only three shelters and only two more in the rest of the
nation, according to Pisklakova.</TE>
<TE>   "Domestic violence is many times the seed for future crimes of
violence," Parker said. "Russian police over the last several years
have come to recognize this and are absolutely hungry for this kind
of training."</TE>
<TE>   Mages, who is excited to be a part of the international effort,
said she was surprised by the Russian officials she met.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really impressed with their knowledge and their willingness
to work on the project," Mages said. "They seem to be really
committed."</TE>

<HD>Upgrade of Subway Doors</HD>
<DH>Preparedness: MTA will spend $600,000 to make emergency
doors easier to push open. Stations will get new exit signs.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 emergency exit hatches across the MTA's subway system
will be fitted with new springs to decrease the amount of force
needed to open the heavy doors during an evacuation, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said that if an
emergency such as a fire, crash or terrorist attack were to occur on
the 17-mile Red Line, some passengers might not be strong enough to
push the steel doors open and climb to the street.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the springs and hinges on the 120 doors have eroded over
time, causing some not to work as they should, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This has become a major concern," said John Catoe, deputy chief
executive of the MTA, who has started a review of the agency's safety
and security practices, including procedures for protecting the Red
Line's 16 stations from terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Catoe said the springs, along with air-pressurized canisters that
will help power the doors as they open, will cost about $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   He said the changes will ensure that the doors open with just 30
pounds of pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The doors are the final step in an elaborate system of emergency
corridors, including passageways that catacomb behind the public
areas of the MTA's subways.</TE>

<DH>Investigation: Detectives may finally be close to solving
the 1974 killing of an LAPD officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Above Jeri Edwards' couch hang three oil portraits of her son dressed
in his LAPD uniform, the hat nearly hiding his thin face and proud
smile.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-eight years ago today, Officer Michael Edwards'
bullet-ridden body was discovered in an abandoned, burned-out
apartment building in South-Central Los Angeles. Since then, Edwards,
a Riverside resident, has visited her son's grave in Cypress several
times a year to clean the headstone and leave fresh-cut flowers. Each
time, she tries not to think about what happened. But she can't help
wondering.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know," said Edwards, 76. "I wish I did know. I can't
understand why anybody would want to hurt him."</LD>
<TE>   Now, as she honors the anniversary of his 1974 death, she is
filled with renewed hope that detectives may finally be on the verge
of solving the case, one of only two unsolved killings of Los Angeles
Police Department officers.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives reopened their investigation three years ago and have
again ruled out some of their initial suspects, including a fellow
LAPD officer, street gang members and even the Symbionese Liberation
Army. Though detectives still lack enough evidence to make an arrest,
they say they now believe his slaying may have been for personal
rather than professional reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, 26, a father of two who was separated from his wife and
seeing other women, may have been the victim of a jealous husband,
they say. Although the initial investigators had received a tip along
those lines within days, it was barely pursued at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "We're famous for putting on blinders and thinking it's got to be
something to do with your job," said LAPD Det. Dennis Kilcoyne, who
is investigating the murder. "If it was Joe the plumber, that's the
first thing we'd look at. We'd look at his personal life--what's he
up to, who does he owe money to, who is he dating."</TE>
<TE>   The Edwards murder has hovered over the LAPD like a dark shadow.
The original detectives traveled to at least 10 states to follow
leads, and the case has led to books and billboards, but no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried just about everything we could do at that time," said
Tom McGuine, one of the initial detectives on the case, who retired
in 1983. "We had the people power, we had the time, we had everything
going for us. But sometimes you get to a point where you just don't
get the answer."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1948, Edwards was the middle child of a homemaker and a
car salesman. As a teenager, he built skateboards and played the
electric guitar. Three years after graduating from high school in
Long Beach, he joined the LAPD in 1969 and became a patrol officer in
the 77th Street Division.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' mother was proud, but apprehensive. "As a mother, you
worry," she said. "But you try and go on with life."</TE>
<TE>   When Edwards and his wife started having problems, he moved in
with his parents and started dating an unmarried police dispatcher,
his mother said. He also was friendly with another woman who worked
near the division and was recently married, according to detectives.</TE>
<TE>   On May 10, 1974, Edwards had just finished his last day on a stint
with the LAPD's gang task force and headed to the bar at the Los
Angeles Police Academy to meet some friends.</TE>
<TE>   A guard saw him leave the academy about 10:30 p.m. in his Ford
Pinto station wagon. A short time later, he was back at the 77th
Street station. After leaving there, he was seen by witnesses at a
nearby hospital, Kilcoyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe that shortly afterward, he was forced to go to the
abandoned building at 122 W. 89th St., where he was shot six times
with a 9-millimeter handgun. His body was found in the morning by two
neighborhood teens on their way to the market. His shirt was pulled
over his face and he was handcuffed. Both his car and service
revolver were missing.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Edwards' car was found in the 1000 block of West 186th
Street, near what was then the Ascot Raceway, a frequent drop spot
for stolen vehicles. Divorce papers from his wife were on the
passenger seat, detectives say. Police believe that at least two
people were involved in the murder.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' sister, Sue Davis, has her own theory about her brother's
murder: "He must have trusted someone he shouldn't have. He couldn't
get out of it."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to bring him back, but it'd be nice to know," said
Davis, 46, who regularly accompanies her mother to the grave site.</TE>
<TE>   It had been years since the Edwards family had heard from LAPD
detectives. They assumed that the department had given up hope of
solving the case. Then, in the fall of 1999, LAPD Dets. Kilcoyne,
Rosemary Sanchez and Paul Coulter knocked on the door.</TE>
<TE>   A few months earlier, detectives from the LAPD and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department had established a team to reexamine the
handful of unsolved slayings of LAPD officers and sheriff's deputies.
They started with the 1985 murder of Sheriff's Deputy George Arthur.
Through DNA evidence, they said, they determined that Arthur had been
slain by a retired fellow deputy allegedly caught up in a love
triangle. Before the suspect, Ted Kirby, could be arrested, he
committed suicide, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives then turned their attention to the Edwards killing,
poring through evidence and reviewing what their colleagues had done
before them. They looked at earlier suspects, including one of
Edwards' fellow officers. He was also dating the dispatcher, did not
have a solid alibi and did not do well on a polygraph exam,
detectives said. Eventually, they decided the officer was not
involved in Edwards' death.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during the original investigation, the LAPD offered a
$15,000 reward and posted billboards that read, "Who Executed Mike?"</TE>
<TE>   "They had a lot of calls, tips and crazy clues, but nothing,"
Kilcoyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1981, Edwards' service revolver was found, raising
detectives' hopes. A woman brought the gun to a Las Vegas police
station after seeing a gun safety message on television. LAPD
detectives interviewed the woman and the friend who had given the gun
to her, but determined that they had no link to the murder.</TE>
<TE>   The number of possible suspects, along with the era during which
Edwards was killed, inspired author Wendy Hornsby to write a novel
and James Ellroy to write an as yet unfinished screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   "What's amazing to me is, here is this nice, but not exceptional,
young man, and there were so many people who could have killed him,"
said Hornsby, whose book "77th Street Requiem" was published in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   To Hornsby, one of the most intriguing angles was the possible
connection to the Symbionese Liberation Army, which had been hiding
out in the neighborhood after kidnapping newspaper heiress Patricia
Hearst in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after Edwards' body was found, six SLA members died in a
fiery shootout with police a few miles away. Suspicion quickly turned
to the radical group, which had been outspoken about its plans to
incite a revolution. Authorities tested the weapons used by SLA
members slain in the shootout, but could not link them to Edwards'
murder.</TE>
<TE>   After reopening the case in 1999--coincidentally about the same
time accused SLA member Sara Jane Olson was arrested on attempted
bombing charges dating to 1975--authorities re-tested the weapons
used in the shootout and others seized in a 1975 raid on SLA safe
houses in Northern California. Again unable to make a connection,
detectives ruled out the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   The new detective team also visited the crime scene, talked to
Edwards' friends and family members, and sent letters to former and
current officers in the 77th Street Division. They had the FBI retest
fingerprints and found a match on prints lifted from a soda can in
the alley. That proved another dead end when the prints turned out to
belong to a child in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that Kilcoyne and his fellow detectives started
focusing on Edwards as a man, rather than as an officer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's usually not the Sunday night mystery," Kilcoyne said. "It's
usually something blatant right in front of you. You just overlook
it."</TE>
<TE>   Four days after the murder, one of Edwards' friends told police
that Edwards had been involved with a woman who worked near the
precinct.</TE>
<TE>   But Kilcoyne said the lead, one of dozens that flooded in shortly
after the murder, was not completely investigated. He says the reason
was that Edwards was white and the woman was black, and former
detectives had told him they didn't believe Edwards would have dated
a black woman.</TE>
<TE>   "That's hard to swallow now, but in 1974, the mind-set of society
was totally different," Kilcoyne said.</TE>
<TE>   Now detectives think the tip may be the key to solving the case,
and they are continuing to conduct interviews and gather evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Kilcoyne said he is optimistic but also mindful of the passage of
time. A few witnesses, as well as four of the six original
detectives, are dead. Memories are fading.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what you find in the archive box, there is still a lot
of information that went to the grave," Kilcoyne said. "This is an
old, old case."</TE>

<HD>Police Stations No Safe Haven, Panel Reports</HD>
<DH>Security: The county grand jury found that six were closed
after 6 p.m. and had no armed officers on site after business hours.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A majority of area police and sheriff stations are inaccessible to
residents after business hours and do not have armed officers on site
at all times, according to a Ventura County Grand Jury report
released this week.</LD>
<LD>   The panel studied the issue after hearing about a woman being
followed by someone who was trying to force her off the road as she
drove home from work early in the morning.</LD>
<LD>   "She headed for the local police station for help, and upon
arrival she found a poorly lighted building with no clearly marked
entrance and no sign of any police personnel," the panel wrote,
calling it a "terrifying experience."</LD>
<TE>   The grand jury report did not name the police station but said the
woman eventually located an officer on patrol in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Grand jurors visited 10 police and sheriff stations during off
hours to judge safety conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The panel found that stations in Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark,
Ojai, Santa Paula and Ventura lock their public lobbies by about 6
p.m. each night. The stations are not staffed with armed officers
during nonbusiness hours, though other officers are on patrol in the
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "All law enforcement agencies should provide a safe haven 24 hours
a day, seven days a week," the panel wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that all six stations have phones outside that
can be used to dial a dispatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Some law enforcement leaders believe the report is misleading
because four of the six stations with locked lobbies--Camarillo,
Fillmore, Moorpark and Ojai--are in small cities that contract for
police services with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very rare that someone races to one of those stations with
an emergency [after business hours]," Undersheriff Craig Husband
said. "Most people go to the nearest public area or call us on a cell
phone."</TE>
<TE>   Husband said it would cost each of the contract cities about
$400,000 annually to hire additional officers to staff their stations
around the clock and that such an expense is unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more effective to keep our resources on the street," he
said. "We get most of our contacts with people by driving around."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Santa Paula and Ventura police departments have said
limited funding and a lack of need prompted them to lock their
lobbies at night.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, police officials scaled back lobby hours a couple of
years ago and reassigned civilian police services officers--who had
been used to staff a front desk--to area storefronts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an effort to use our resources as effectively as we
can," said Ventura Police Chief Mike Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fewer hours, the grand jury noted that police
stations in Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai and Port Hueneme do not have
24-hour monitored camera surveillance outside.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras at the Ventura Police Station were not working when the
panel visited. Tracy said his department has been upgrading its
surveillance system, which should be complete by next month.</TE>
<TE>   Top marks went to the Simi Valley Police Department and the
sheriff's station in Thousand Oaks, both of which have 24-hour public
lobbies, round-the-clock deputies at the stations, manned
surveillance monitors and good outdoor lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Police Lt. Rex Jones said his department was planning
to spend $50,000 to upgrade the surveillance system, which is already
powerful enough to allow deputies at monitoring stations to see what
people are reading in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   The stations in Ventura, Moorpark and Ojai received poor marks for
outdoor lighting and signs. Officials at those stations said they
were evaluating the claims.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement agencies are required to respond to the grand
jury report within 90 days.</TE>

<HD>Knott's to Test Four-Point Restraint</HD>
<DH>Safety: Woman's death prompted state order that park make
the change or restrict the types of people allowed on the water ride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Knott's Berry Farm is refining a four-point restraint system--the
same harness used by fighter pilots--to help meet state safety
requirements after a fatal accident on the Perilous Plunge water
ride.</LD>
<LD>   The new restraint system is still being developed, but park
General Manager Jack Falfas said the design will include a seat belt
and over-the-shoulder harness. The T-shaped lap bar will remain. The
design change was prompted by a fatal accident Sept. 21, when Lori
Mason-Larez, 40, of Duarte was ejected from the ride as it plunged
down a 115-foot, 75-degree drop at speeds up to 50 mph.</LD>
<LD>   After a six-month investigation, officials from the Department of
Occupational Safety and Health blamed the water ride's safety
restraints--a lap bar and seat belt--and ordered the park to change
the restraints or restrict the types of people who can ride.
Mason-Larez weighed 292 pounds, which may have contributed to the
accident.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to meet everybody's criteria," Falfas said. "I'm going
to have something that goes above and beyond so that we can sleep at
night knowing we did the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   The prototype has been installed in one of Perilous Plunge's
24-passenger cars and will be tested with dummies. It must be
inspected and approved by the state before the ride can reopen.</TE>
<TE>   The design--including color and buckle styles--is still being
determined. The prototype for one restraint system cost $400, and
does not include the cost of the consultants and engineers Falfas
gathered to develop the restraint.</TE>
<TE>   One of those consultants, Carley Ward of Biodynamics Engineering
Inc., said, "No matter what ride or what car it is, the more belts
you put on a person, the safer they're going to be. It's just what
people will tolerate or find convenient to use."</TE>
<TE>   Engineer Richard Brown said the group quickly agreed to the
design.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at the dynamics of the ride and the fact that you go a

<HD>County's Jobless Rate Drops to 4.4%</HD>
<DH>Labor: Record employment level in April signals continued
recovery from recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the U.S. employment picture worsened in April, Ventura County
continued its steady march toward full economic recovery, registering
its lowest jobless rate since the recession hit last June and its
highest employment level in history.</LD>
<LD>   Unemployment nationwide surged three-tenths of a percent last
month to 6%, a near eight-year high.</LD>
<LD>   But the county's rate of joblessness fell from 4.7% in March to
4.4% last month, mostly due to a jump in agricultural employment from
the strawberry harvest.</LD>
<TE>   That compares to a peak of 5.5% in January, which was the highest
since 1999. California's jobless rate was 6.3% in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our own little economic miracle happening right here in
Ventura County," said Bill Watkins, director of the Economic Forecast
Project at UC Santa Barbara. "I have to believe Ventura County's
economy is one of the most dynamic in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins cited a new study by Forbes Magazine/Milken Institute that
rated Ventura County as having the fourth best economic climate for
business in America.</TE>
<TE>   The county ranked 18th the previous year out of 200 metropolitan
areas surveyed.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings were based on wage and salary growth, high-tech
production and growth, first-quarter employment and "job momentum" as
gauges of how quickly a local economy has recovered from the
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County ranked particularly high in recent salary gains and
a five-year surge in development of high-tech businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County "has experienced blistering growth in tech," Forbes
reports, partly because of the expansion of two giant firms, Amgen
and WellPoint Health Networks.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the 10 top locations as "Best Places for Business and
Careers" were in California. The top three were San Diego, Santa Rosa
and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of Ventura County's fast-firing economic engine is a
steady increase in traffic and increased crowding in households due
to a sharp escalation in home prices, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides suggesting the overall strength of a balanced economy, the
April job figures showed that Ventura County had rebounded almost
completely from a slowdown that brought two straight months of job
losses early this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, 18,800 workers had no jobs, 1,100 fewer than the month
before and 4,500 fewer than in January.</TE>
<TE>   The month's 4.4% rate compares with 3.3% in April 2001, when the
jobless rate was the lowest in decades.</TE>
<TE>   But that is a reflection of an expanding work force, not fewer
jobs in the county.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, total local jobs rose 3,100 last month from March and
were up 1,500 from the previous April. There were 307,500 positions,
a record high. And the number of county workers employed here and in
other counties rose to 405,300, the second highest in history.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's unemployment rate was 10th best of 58 counties in
the state, and on par with Southern California, which has weathered
the recession far better than the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County, which ranked seventh on the Forbes list,
had the state's lowest jobless rate, 2.9%. Orange and San Diego
counties had rates of 3.7% and 3.8% respectively. Los Angeles County
had a 6.5% rate.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, this region is doing much better than the state,"
Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is riding out the downturn better than the state
and nation because heavy manufacturing and Internet businesses, the
nation's weakest sectors, are not dominant here.</TE>
<TE>   Other large employers include the Navy, education, a variety of
service industries and a surging farm economy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the biggest job gains last month were apparently fueled by
a continuing strawberry harvest, which began in February.</TE>
<TE>   Farm-related employment increased by 2,900 in a month after a
3,900 job increase the previous two months. Farms employed 800 more
workers in April than in the same month last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonfarm employment increased by just 200 jobs during the month and
by 700 jobs during the last year. Construction jobs were flat for the
month and off by 900 in a year.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturing sector, hit hardest by the short recession, was
down 100 jobs in a month but were up 100 since April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The largest year-to-year gain was in government employment, which
was up 1,400 jobs in a year.</TE>
<TE>   The second-largest increase from last year was in the finance,
insurance and real estate sectors, which expanded by 700 jobs.</TE>

<HD>'Hunter' Gets the Ultimate L.A. Insult On-Air: 'You'll
Never Get an Emmy'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The caller to the McDonnell/Douglas radio show on KSPN-AM (1110) was
enraged. Guest Fred Dryer, a pro football player turned actor (TV's
"Hunter"), had just questioned whether the Lakers had enough "heart"
to win another championship ring. The caller snarled to Dryer,
"You'll never get a ring." Then the Lakers fan hurled the ultimate
insult in this town: "And, you won't get an Emmy or Oscar either!"</LD>
<LD>   On the move: When David and Louise Gish of Upland received a
travelogue in the mail, they didn't know whether it advertised a
sightseeing trip of fiords or an SUV trip.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Smith of Camarillo came upon a voyage of another type--back
in time. It's all a bit disorienting--like the signs spotted by Karen
Masters of San Diego (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Food for thought: Now here's a big takeout order--one Kosher
Burrito business to go. But where?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the half-century-old stand on 1st Street, the home of the
true L.A. dining experience, is shutting down to make way for the
construction of a Caltrans complex. No closure date has been
announced, but businesses on the block have been told they must move
out by June 1. Dan Rosenfeld of Urban Partners, the project
developer, said he hopes the Kosher Burrito stand can move into the
Caltrans building. "Caltrans people usually don't show a lot of
emotion," he said. "But they were very enthusiastic" about a
relocation.</TE>
<TE>   The complex won't open for at least 18 months, however. In the
meantime, owner Ken Han is negotiating with the city about moving to
a temporary site. If Kosher Burrito ceases, I don't know where I'll
go for a comparable experience. Perhaps Genghis Cohen's restaurant on
Fairfax Avenue. Or Sushi of Naples.</TE>
<TE>   Kiss off: A few years ago, I asked readers to come up with a
roadside hand signal that would say "I'm sorry" to cut down on the
number of cases of road rage. I believe we settled on raising the
hands, as though in surrender--not a maneuver to try at 75 mph,
though. Anyway, columnist Tom Hennessy of the Long Beach
Press-Telegram was the recipient of another peace sign the other day.</TE>
<TE>   Cut off in traffic, he was admittedly "on the brink of saying
something angry and stupid" when the offending driver pulled up
alongside him. But Hennessy changed his mind "when, from the palm of
her hand, she blew me a kiss." A great idea--in that situation. I'm
not sure, however, it would defuse a dispute between two men.</TE>

<HD>Playing B Flat and Finding X at 16,000 Feet</HD>
<DH>At 13, eighth-grader has reached two of the world's highest
peaks, and kept up with oboe practice and homework.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ain't no mountain high enough for Samantha Larson.</LD>
<LD>   At 12, she climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. On March 1, at 13,
she reached the top of Argentina's Mt. Aconcagua, the highest peak in
South America.</LD>
<LD>   Both ascents were international father-daughter adventures for the
Long Beach eighth-grader, who needed special government permits for
both climbs because of her youth.</LD>
<TE>   One thing for which she must hold a world record: doing algebra
homework at 16,000 feet. And how many teenagers would lug along an
oboe to get in some band practice on a South American mountain?</TE>
<TE>   "That was her idea," her father, Dave, insisted. "She almost did
not go on the last climb because she's in the all-district honor
orchestra. And she had rehearsals up until the day we left, a
rehearsal three hours after we got home and a concert the next day."</TE>
<TE>   The pair arrived Feb. 15 at the national park below Mt. Aconcagua.
On Feb. 17, they started the 23-mile, two-day trek to the base camp.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha remembers very clearly Feb. 17, when she caught her first
glimpse of the breathtaking mountain she was about to climb. It is
the peak up which the Incas had carried and sacrificed chosen
children to their deities.</TE>
<TE>   Her long brown hair tucked beneath a hat and sunshade contraption,
Samantha was dressed for the harsh elements that can strike suddenly
at high altitude.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really sure what I had gotten myself into," she said
with a shy laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The sky was brilliant blue, she recalled. The snow was
spectacular, the landscape barren. Not much grows above 11,000 feet.
At 16,000 feet, Dave Larson said, heartbeats and breath come much
faster because the altitude offers only half the oxygen of sea level.</TE>
<TE>   But Samantha did fine. On March 1, the willowy honor student and
her 46-year-old father reached the desolate top of the 22,841-foot
mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha's odyssey had begun two years earlier, when her father
realized that he no longer ran regularly. Mountain climbing, he
thought, would require him to stay fit. He invited his whole family
to join him, but only his daughter was game.</TE>
<TE>   The pair frequented Mt. Baldy in the San Gabriel Mountains and
Rock Gym, a Long Beach indoor climbing center. They found that they
loved the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Kilimanjaro and Aconcagua were chosen because they are among the
so-called seven summits of the world: the highest peak on each of the
seven continents.</TE>
<TE>   For Aconcagua, Samantha and her father had planned for three
months, but by early February were still awaiting special approval by
Argentine authorities. They needed a waiver from a regulation barring
anyone under 14 from the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   It was nearing the end of the climbing season in the Andes, where
frosty temperatures and snow reduce the yearly window for climbing to
a few short months. If the Larsons missed the chance, it would be
2003 before they could try again.</TE>
<TE>   But the dean of the mountain, a legendary local guide named
Fernando Grajales--known for his 50 years of climbing experience on
Aconcagua--stepped in. His own son, Fernandito, a guide now himself,
had ascended the peak at 16, and he was convinced that the
13-year-old American girl could do it.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandito agreed to escort the Larsons, and the Grajales men made
the case to local authorities, Dave Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the normal complement of two guides, the Larsons were
joined by four: two men and their wives, whose presence over the
two-week visit made Samantha more comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the long trip to reach Mendoza, Argentina, the Larsons
had to present documents showing that Samantha had no trouble
climbing Kilimanjaro. She passed all the physical requirements that
might have prevented her from attempting the summit, said her father,
an anesthesiologist at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Right before you left base camp, the national parks system had a
doctor there who examined you and checked the oxygen saturation of
your blood," Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people think that the risks are even greater for kids. You
have to be 18 to summit with American companies. But Samantha just
does real well in high altitude. And she had trained."</TE>
<TE>   Most of their party were men in their 30s or 40s. There were a few
Europeans, a couple of guys from Texas and a California girl with an
oboe and homework.</TE>
<TE>   Records on the youngest and oldest climbers to summit a peak are
kept by local authorities in various countries, primarily because a
mountain of paperwork must now be submitted on the fitness of
climbers--the result of high-profile climbing tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   "Samantha is definitely the youngest person to reach the summit of
Mt. Aconcagua," Fernando Grajales confirmed this week by e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha never mentioned setting records during a recent interview
at her father's home on the Long Beach peninsula near Belmont Shore.
It was her former English teacher at Hughes Middle School, Laura
Malloy, who suggested the story to a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "She and her family are the last people who would call you,"
Malloy said. "But I think this girl is just a wonderful student and
yet unassuming and conscientious and caring of her fellow students.
She almost didn't go on the trip because there aren't a lot of oboe
players, and she wasn't going to let anyone down."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha might have been the only student on the mountain, but she
found no lack of interest in the subjects she was studying in school.
She even got help with her homework.</TE>
<TE>   "The Europeans were very interested in the mechanics of our
democracy, the checks and balances and branches of the government,"
Larson said. "And the Belgian guy is a mathematics tutor, so Samantha
could ask him for help with some of her problems."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha also had a science project due when she returned to
school. She was supposed to pose a scientific question, then find and
illustrate the answer.</TE>
<TE>   In what would later become her school's entry in the district
science fair, Samantha showed what happens to the body at high
altitude.</TE>
<TE>   On the climb, she used a portable medical device each night to
check fellow climbers' blood oxygen levels--an indicator for altitude
sickness.</TE>
<TE>   The guides were impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I must tell you," Grajales said, "she is very strong, and her
determination is admirable."</TE>

officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Paleontologists estimate that the 20-foot-long fossil, found April
17 at the Prima Deshecha Landfill, is at least 5 million years old.
The skeleton is nearly intact, which suggests the baby baleen whale
nose-dived into mud, preventing scavengers from getting to its
carcass, officials said.</LD>

<HD>Child Fatally Shot When Gang Members Intervene</HD>
<DH>Panorama City: Police say the men were trying to stop a
fight between the boy's relatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR. and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 3-year-old boy was fatally shot outside a Panorama City apartment
complex when gang members trying to break up an argument between the
boy's aunt and uncle opened fire, Los Angeles police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Alfredo Cardenas Jr., known to his family and neighbors as
"Junior," was pronounced dead at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van
Nuys at 11 p.m. Thursday, about 90 minutes after a bullet struck him
in the chest as he walked in the 14700 block of Blythe Street with
his father, aunt, uncle and a baby cousin.</LD>
<LD>   "I just remember hearing a gunshot and picking up my son," Alfredo
Cardenas Sr. said in Spanish as he struggled to hold back tears
Friday. "He was dying in my arms."</LD>
<TE>   The shooting, which occurred about a block from the Cardenas
apartment, appeared to be a case of area gang members trying to
dispense their own form of street justice in combination with an act
of chivalry gone bad, said Det. Al Aldaz of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Van Nuys Division.</TE>
<TE>   Police and relatives said an argument between the boy's aunt and
uncle involved some yelling and a little pushing as they walked in an
open area from Strathern Street toward Blythe Street. Moments later,
two men walked over to the couple and were joined by three other men
who said they objected to how the boy's uncle was treating the aunt.</TE>
<TE>   After words were exchanged, the gang members attacked the uncle
and one of them pulled out a gun and fired, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a case of the gang trying to flex their muscles in the
area," Aldaz said. "A gang member who believed that the woman had
been hit approached the victim's uncle and told him, 'That's no way
to treat a lady.'"</TE>
<TE>   No suspects had been arrested by late Friday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Cardenas' two-bedroom apartment, the boy's mother,
Gregoria Velasquez Cardenas, cried as she looked at photographs of
Alfredo. On a nearby coffee table was a homicide detective's business
card.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so small and friendly," she said of her son. "All he
wanted to do was play."</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo was the youngest of four children. His sisters are ages 7,
9 and 17.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors recalled Alfredo as outgoing and talkative. They said he
often whizzed through his apartment complex on his favorite toy, a
scooter his family bought him more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Junior, don't go in the street!" neighbor Martin Galvan, 38,
remembered hearing Gregoria yell to her son in Spanish. "He really
knew how to ride that thing."</TE>
<TE>   Local residents reflected on the killing in an area with a
reputation of being plagued by gangs, but which in recent years has
seen overall crime drop dramatically, according to the Los Angeles
city attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said improvements came with new development, efforts
by property owners to stand against crime and a 1993 court-ordered
injunction that targeted Blythe Street gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "Blythe Street is better off because of the injunction,
enforcement efforts and other community resources," said LAPD Deputy
Chief Ronald Bergman. "But shootings like this show we still have a
problem and we are going to have to continue to work on it."</TE>
<TE>   James Hearon, 22, who has lived on Blythe for four years, agreed
that conditions are better now. "It was much worse years ago," Hearon
said. "Now, I'll hear helicopters and once in a while I'll hear
gunshots, but I don't feel like I should be afraid to walk down the
street."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from spots of graffiti, parts of the neighborhood have what
residents describe as a swap meet atmosphere. Families sell rose
bouquets, clothing and religious paintings on street corners while
others go door-to-door selling food and other goods.</TE>
<TE>   But for some residents, the shooting reminded them of the street's
violent history, which has included rampant drug dealing.</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself never to walk down Blythe," said Galvan, who lives
downstairs from Alfredo's family. "I've seen how bad it can be in the
daytime. I told myself never to go down there at night."</TE>

<HD>Suspect on the Run in Stabbing of Woman, 3 Children Gives
Up</HD>
<DH>Crime: The victim had obtained a restraining order to keep
man from her home, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a court order to stay away, Nathaniel Lee Ruffin allegedly
returned to an apartment near Dodger Stadium at 3 a.m. Friday,
stabbed a woman and three children, and fled before surrendering
hours later, Los Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Ruffin turned himself in Friday afternoon, accompanied by another
woman who police say was his wife, said Lt. Andy Monsue of the Los
Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Ruffin, 52, who faces four counts of attempted murder and other
possible charges, was being held without bail, Monsue said.</LD>
<TE>   The 42-year-old woman who was stabbed had a 16-year relationship
and children with Ruffin, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the assault, Ruffin crashed and overturned his van
on the edge of Chinatown, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the morning, he was sighted near Pershing Square in
downtown Los Angeles, but escaped.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of the public and Ruffin's relatives, police were
able to put pressure on the suspect, Monsue said.</TE>
<TE>   "The beating of bushes is probably what drew him out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police used dogs and a helicopter in their search for the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Ruffin's 13-year-old son was stabbed as he tried to protect his
mother, said Sgt. John Pasquariello. Two daughters, ages 8 and 16,
also tried to intervene to help their mother and were stabbed,
Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and all three children were reported in stable
condition at various hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   The early morning attack on Centennial Street awoke neighbors, who
recalled later that Ruffin came to the same apartment house last fall
and allegedly beat up the woman.</TE>
<TE>   That episode helped lead to the restraining order she obtained
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "She kept hollering, 'Help! Help! Help!' but we were across the
way and couldn't help," said neighbor Nydia Macias.</TE>
<TE>   "The cops got here very, very quick.... But it still couldn't
prevent what happened."</TE>

<HD>4 Men Held in Spate of School Burglaries</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspects are linked to 74 break-ins in the
southwest San Fernando Valley during the last five months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four men were arrested Friday on suspicion of stealing computers and
other equipment worth tens of thousands of dollars from as many as 50
schools in the San Fernando Valley during the last few months, Los
Angeles school police said.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Unified School District police officers arrested
Marvin Earl Kinney Jr., 20, of Winnetka, Robert Harris, 20, of
Woodland Hills, and a man without identification also believed to be
20 years old about 8:15 a.m. at the Aku Aku Motor Inn on Ventura
Boulevard in Woodland Hills. A short time later, Harold Shields, 19,
was arrested at his family's home in the 22000 block of Del Valle
Street in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The men were booked on suspicion of burglary and receiving stolen
property. They were being held late Friday at the Los Angeles Police
Department's West Valley Division jail.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a very good day for us," said Los Angeles Unified Det.
Steve Crowell. He said a tip received two weeks ago led investigators
to the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Wads of cash, hand-held computers, cell phones, stereos and
personal computers--some marked with school names--were recovered in
the motel. Tools such as hammers and screw drivers, which police
believe were used to force entry into the campuses, were also found.</TE>
<TE>   "This is mine," said Officer Jackie Maddox picking up a laptop
computer etched with markings from Taft High School, where she
usually works. "I'm so glad to see this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the suspects are linked to 74 break-ins in the
southwest Valley during the last five months. School police officials
said there are usually 12 to 15 break-ins a month throughout the 230
district schools in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very brazen," Crowell said of the suspects. "Sometimes
they'll hit one to three schools a night, or the same school three to
four times a week."</TE>
<TE>   School administrators said the break-ins have caused damage to
door frames, cabinets, documents and safes.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup has disrupted work, and stolen equipment is unlikely
to be replaced because of tight school budgets.</TE>
<TE>   One burglary occurred at Calabash Street Elementary School in
Woodland Hills, which does not have a burglar alarm, so no one was
immediately alerted when the cafeteria was broken into three weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is terrible," said Principal Susan Shaffer. "It's going to
cost the district a lot for repairs."</TE>
<TE>   Taft High was burglarized in April and again in January. Both
times, the administration building and cafeteria were ransacked. The
school is scheduled to have alarms installed in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating," said Principal Myra Fullerton. "You feel
violated."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the burglarized schools include Wilbur Avenue, Hamlin
Street, Lanai Road and Fullbright Avenue elementary schools and the
Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched Studies.</TE>
<TE>   Though school break-ins are common, the recent spate has increased
anxiety among principals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're defenseless," said Wilbur Avenue Principal David Hirsch.
"We're not fortresses, we're elementary schools."</TE>
<TE>   Other principals say that school fences can be easily scaled and
alarm systems are difficult to purchase through the district.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have full coverage [with alarms at all schools]," said
Michael O'Larte, an electronic technical supervisor for the district.
"The next step is there needs to be enough school police."</TE>
<TE>   The 280-member school police force has not grown during the last
decade, despite the addition of 90,000 students to the school system,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not too many people," said Sgt. Michael Bowman, "to watch
the schools at 3 in the morning."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana to Lose Hunger Artists' Act to Fullerton</HD>
<DH>Stage: Struggling to survive because of rent increases and
limited seating, theater company will take over venue used by
Vanguard ensemble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hunger Artists Theater, a downtown Santa Ana fixture for 4 1/2
years, plans to move to Fullerton after closing its current
production of "Hamlet" on May 26.</LD>
<LD>   The Hunger Artists' rent has more than doubled in recent years on
a second-floor walk-up at 204 E. 4th St. that could seat only about
40 people. The cramped space limited the productions, and lugging
props and scenery up the stairs presented a challenge. What's more,
the Hunger Artists' location in a business strip is a cultural
world--though only three blocks--away from the Artists Village,
centered at Broadway and 2nd Street, where the city has placed most
of its $11-million bet on galleries, theaters, restaurants, art
schools and artists' residences. The city is working to revitalize
its downtown by creating a thriving urban arts scene.</LD>
<LD>   "The Hunger Artists have been a significant player in presenting
quality theater. It's a loss," said Jim Gilliam, the city's arts
administrator. The company's rent problem is a symptom of rising
property values as the neighborhood improves, Gilliam said. He tried
to help the Hunger Artists find other quarters in the city.</LD>
<TE>   But Mark Palkoner, the theater's co-managing director, said Friday
that everything in Santa Ana would have cost at least $2,000 a month.
Palkoner said the company can double its seating capacity for little
more than the $1,240 rent it pays now by moving to a warehouse
district in Fullerton. It will occupy a 78-seat theater recently
vacated by the Vanguard Theatre Ensemble. Vanguard, the
longest-running storefront company in Orange County, is seeking a
larger home.</TE>
<TE>   The Hunger Artists, named after a story by Franz Kafka, always
have lived hand to mouth while emphasizing out-of-the-mainstream
plays. The company has $70 in the bank at the moment, said artistic
director Melissa Petro. The average attendance per performance is
about 20, she said. The tiny capacity has hurt the Hunger Artists
because when they did score a hit, they had to turn away business. In
the bigger Fullerton space, Petro said, the nonprofit company can
expect a greater fiscal boost from each successful show.</TE>
<TE>   Petro said the theater's young core audience hasn't been bothered
by its barrio location. Still, with bars nearby, theater patrons
sometimes encounter drunks and panhandlers, she said, and lately
there has been an increase in automobile break-ins.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way we could make it in the space we're at," said
Petro, an emergency-room nurse who is putting up about $3,000 of her
own money to cover moving expenses. "I'm tired of fighting a losing

a theater and it's in a nice area. We have a chance; we have a hope."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the recent news for Santa Ana theater has been bad. The
Rude Guerrilla Theater Company, a storefront in the Artists Village,
has resolved rent problems with its landlord. It too had been
threatening to move.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster the prospects of theater in Santa Ana, Gilliam is
spearheading the newly formed Theatre Alliance of Santa Ana. Ten
companies belong. Among the goals, Gilliam said, are joint efforts to
advertise and market theater productions and to establish a
collective online ticketing service.</TE>

<HD>Dig This: Prehistoric Whale Skeleton Found</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Baby baleen uncovered in San Juan Capistrano is
at least 5 million years old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Juan Capistrano landfill crew digging for a new spot to dump
trash uncovered the skeleton of a prehistoric baby whale, Orange
County waste department officials said Friday. Paleontologists
estimate that the 20-foot-long fossil is at least 5 million years old
and possibly as old as 7 million years.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not experts on fossils," said Sue Gordon, a spokeswoman
for Orange County's Integrated Waste Management. "We are experts on
trash."</LD>
<LD>   But Gordon and her colleagues at the department have learned a lot
since the discovery April 17 at the Prima Deshecha Landfill.</LD>
<TE>   The skeleton is nearly intact, which suggests the baby baleen
whale nose-dived into mud, preventing scavengers from getting to its
carcass, Gordon said. Its location also suggests that what is now San
Juan Capistrano was once deep under the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said landfill workers frequently discover fossils and other
items of archeological interest, but they are usually in small
pieces. In fact, such finds are so common that two paleontology and
archeology groups contract with the waste management department.</TE>
<TE>   Any time crews find something, they stop work and call the
scientists.</TE>
<TE>   With the latest discovery, paleontologists will be able to rebuild
most of the skeleton: skull, ribs and most of the vertebrae.</TE>
<TE>   Once the excavation is complete, the pieces will be coated with a
hardening agent, wrapped in burlap and plaster, and encased for
storage, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is such a rare fossil," she said, "that essentially it will be
put on display. But that is still further down the road."</TE>

<HD>Pets Turned In by Owners Deserve Same Protection as Those
Off the Streets</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KAREN KARLITZ recently spoke to Paula Kislak, who was instrumental in
drafting this law.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   PAULA KISLAK</LD>
<TE>   Veterinarian, Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Sen. Tom Hayden's legislation aims to give animals in the
shelter system a better chance of being reunited with their owners or
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   A significant number of animals turned in by "owners" turn out to
not belong to the people bringing them in. Los Angeles shelters get
calls all the time from people whose pets have been trapped by
neighbors or former spouses and brought in as owner-relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles has six geographically dispersed shelters,
and an animal that is turned in can be transferred to any one of
them. Owners must check them all, every day, for their missing pets.</TE>
<TE>   Many shelters also have customer-unfriendly hours. The Hayden
legislation modestly increases the number of days that stray animals
are held before they can be euthanized and increases the hours or
days, or both, that shelters remain open. Before the Hayden bill
became law, owner-relinquished animals could be killed the moment
they entered the shelter, because, technically, ownership transferred
to the shelter from the person turning in the animal. And that
usually was the case, because that was how the shelters controlled
their populations.</TE>
<TE>   Shelters were never mandated by law to take in owner-relinquished
animals, and under the Hayden law they're still not. But as of July
1, shelters must keep owner-relinquished animals for the same time
they do strays.</TE>
<TE>   Studies done by Tufts University and Colorado State University
veterinary schools show the owner-relinquished population to be the
most adoptable.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the new holding time, California will be one of the six
states with the shortest holding periods. Extended holding periods do
not have to cause overcrowding. Shelters can go back to their funding
authorities--city, county or private--to ask for money to build more
kennels.</TE>
<TE>   This law was passed because we wanted to end absolute shelter
discretion to kill. We also wanted improved spay and neuter
opportunities and improved options for adoption and recovery of lost
pets. These are cost-effective methods for reducing shelter
populations.</TE>
<TE>   Since this law was enacted, shelters have reduced their impound
rates. In 1998 about 98,000 animals were impounded in the L.A. County
shelter system. By 1999 the number had dropped to 91,000 and one year
later had fallen to 81,000.</TE>
<TE>   Every time an animal is adopted, the shelters generate revenue;
every time one is killed, it costs them money. If the law's
provisions are implemented faithfully, the shelters could save money.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of this law sometimes claim that adoptable stray animals
will have to be put to sleep sooner to accommodate potentially
less-adoptable owner-relinquished animals.</TE>
<TE>   We shouldn't have to make a choice, and we should do whatever it
takes to accommodate all the animals that end up in our shelter
system.</TE>
<TE>   Shelter funds should be used productively to save lives rather
than kill animals. They are, after all, supposed to be shelters.</TE>

<HD>Good Intentions Jam California Animal Shelters</HD>
<DH>Mandated delays in euthanasia only prolong suffering in
overloaded facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDY DRISCOLL</AU>
<BD>Sandy Driscoll is president of Volunteer Services to
Animals in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When will John Q. Public realize that, for a public agency in a large
city, the "no kill" animal shelter is a myth? Los Angeles city
shelters are mandated to take in any and all stray animals, in
addition to accepting the owned animals that are brought in.</LD>
<LD>   They can never close their doors. They do not have the luxury of
saying, "Sorry, we are full and have no more room."</LD>
<LD>   Former Sen. Tom Hayden's bill, which mandated much longer holding
periods for all pets starting July 1, 1999, was passed into law in a
furor of humane revelry. It has done nothing to stem the never-ending
flow of puppies, kittens, dogs and cats that have been parading
through the front doors of our public and private shelters throughout
the state.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, these animals are kept longer under the legislation, but the
result is not a more humane, no-kill shelter system. We now see a
plethora of diseased animals put in with healthy ones that might be
able to be adopted.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, a second provision of the Hayden law will become
effective, requiring shelters to hold owner-relinquished animals for
the same extended period as strays. The result can only be more
severe overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder just how much time Hayden spent in a public shelter,
witnessing what the passage of his well-intended bill has wrought?
Did he see the overcrowded conditions, dog fights, disease, the shy
and submissive dogs waiting forlornly for their turn at the food
bowl?</TE>
<TE>   I cannot believe that Hayden and his aides spent enough time in a
public shelter to get the true picture of what goes on. When you see,
day in and day out, a never-ending stream of animals entering the
front door, something has to give.</TE>
<TE>   I know plenty of shelter workers who have pets at home that they
have adopted from the shelters in which they work. Despite the heroic
efforts of staff members, volunteers and many wonderful animal groups
devoted to rescue and adoption, euthanasia is often the sad but
necessary response to a society that does not care for its pets
before they take that sometimes final walk through the shelter door.</TE>
<TE>   Let's put the blame squarely where it belongs: on the politicians
concerned primarily with their own agendas and on a public ready to
promote ill-conceived Band-Aid tactics and willing to continue
breeding pets when there are no permanent homes available.</TE>

<LD>Have you noticed all the things crossing over these days? Not just
freeways. We've got country singers crossing over to pop, wrestling
stars crossing over to movies, stand-up comedians crossing over to
stand-up sitcoms. We've got cell phones crossed with messaging
machines and e-mailers. We've got an ex-president who wants a TV talk
show and a tennis star doing calendars because she's prettier on
paper than she plays on court. We've even got sneakers that crossed
over to tennis shoes long ago but now must become cross-trainers
because everything needs a nifty name.</LD>
<LD>   So it shouldn't be surprising that auto makers, who used to
dictate what outrageous chrome concoctions we'd drive next year, have
now divined that Americans want crossover motor vehicles. These
are--do you have a pen and pad ready?--cars that hold people and
cargo like trucks but handle and ride comfortably like nice cars.
They don't have the clunkiness and not-so-nice gas mileage of trucks,
but they do possess a rugged feel that could do without pavement,
though few ever do.</LD>
<LD>   The result in coming weeks will be a packed onramp of new-style
vehicles resembling a station wagon on steroids or a minivan on a
diet. In other words, Americans want everything still, again, even
during an alleged war.</LD>
<TE>   Time was, automobiles were novelties for weekend rides; few sane
people propose Sunday drives now, after two each day Monday through
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Automobiles helped American urbanites cross over to become
suburbanites. After World War II, tank plants changed over to
assembly lines for tank-like station wagons to ferry new couples and
babies to and from new homes in new suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Because we consumed cars so eagerly, automobiles and Americans
became closely identified. We vacationed in them before they were
entertainment centers and moving living rooms. We ate and did other
things in cars, which led to the invention of drive-thrus and
drive-ins.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Americans' car culture defines who we are. More
truthfully, Americans' modern auto affair says more about who we want
to be--comfortable, sleek, new, prosperous-looking, physically and
socially mobile with more options than we'll ever use, including
off-road capability.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, you cannot purchase a new car without certifying
off-street parking to police. Here, parking is your own problem. In
true democratic fashion, any American with a license can drive any
vehicle any time, at least while making payments. But God help the
president who gets between our wheeled symbols of mobility and the
gas pump.</TE>

crossover vehicles, as sandals led to sneakers and cross-trainers.
The unanswered question remains: What were sneakers sneaking up on

<LD>Through most of 1998 and 1999, Steven Anderson, now 47, lived on the
streets of Alkali Flats, a Sacramento neighborhood a 10-minute walk
from the Capitol. Beneath old trees that once shaded the homes of
governors and prominent businessmen, he scored crack cocaine, pot,
methamphetamine and alcohol, trying to medicate himself against his
as-yet-undiagnosed major depression and psychosis.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Anderson returned to Alkali Flats--not to buy drugs
but to contribute his insights at Gov. Gray Davis' Summit on
Homelessness, held April 22 at the Alkali Flats Boys and Girls Club.
Now a full-time counselor for the mental health program Turning
Point, Anderson is a thriving example of the good that California
government has done to help indigent people with mental illness and
addictions. We hope that hearing his success story spurred lawmakers
and the governor to recognize their obvious next move.</LD>
<LD>   Directed to Turning Point after becoming suicidal in November
1999, Anderson was one of the first state residents to have care paid
for under AB 34, a bill by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento) that passed that year.</LD>
<TE>   Before Steinberg's bill, programs to help mentally ill and
addicted people living on the streets "siloed" money. Money that
someone had decided should go to housing went only to housing, money
for medications only to medications and so on, even though that
approach doesn't make a lick of sense to the people who know the most
about how to address the complex web of problems that leave people
sleeping on sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   AB 34, on the other hand, embraces an approach informally known as
"whatever it takes." The money it provides can be used for, in
Steinberg's words, "whatever will help the client move from
homelessness to hope."</TE>
<TE>   In most places, unfortunately, this approach is the exception,
because it's still cheaper from a county's perspective to send a
mentally ill person who breaks the law to prison, where the state
picks up the tab, than to pay for care that can break the cycle of
illness and incarceration, even though AB 34 kicks in money.</TE>
<TE>   In a 15-0 vote Tuesday, the Assembly Health Committee passed a
bill, also by Steinberg, that could correct the perverse incentives
in the system by permitting the state Department of Mental Health to
give more money to any county whose mental health programs reduce the
number of people in prisons or using health-care and other stopgap
services, thereby cutting total state costs.</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense. The state spends $65million each year on AB
34-funded programs such as Turning Point. But a full analysis of the
costs to taxpayers would deduct about $23million in money not spent
on prison and hospital costs. Experts also suspect that AB 34 saves
tens of millions more when people who have been helped, and maybe
even have found jobs, are no longer chronic customers of emergency
rooms and emergency shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Economics as well as compassion should inspire legislative leaders
to expedite the passage of Steinberg's new bill, AB 2057. And Davis
should sign it, giving counties hard cash incentives to do the right
thing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The systematic destruction of the West Virginia and Kentucky
countryside by mining practices that rip off mountaintops and dump
them into valleys has been a national shame for years. That the
federal government would formally endorse such plunder--as the Bush
administration did last week--is an outrage. However, a note of
sanity was struck Wednesday by a federal judge who ordered the
destruction halted as a violation of the letter and spirit of the
Clean Air Act.</LD>
<LD>   Hurrah for District Judge Charles H. Haden II in Charleston, W.
Va., who condemned the attempt by federal agencies "to legalize their
long-standing illegal regulatory practice." Mostly, the Army Corps of
Engineers, no great friend of the environment, had merely granted
miners exemptions from the law.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, expressing
concern for the region's economy, said the administration would seek
a stay of Haden's ruling while an appeal was filed. Perhaps federal
officials are forgetting the congressionally mandated purpose of
their agency. The name, after all, contains the words "environmental
protection."</LD>
<TE>   If the White House insists on appealing, the federal appeals court
and Congress must act to make Haden's ruling permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The mining practice involves shearing off the tops of mountains
with earth-moving equipment to expose the coal. Waste is dumped into
adjacent valleys and streambeds, erasing streams, polluting the water
and contaminating water wells.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law requires restoration of the mountain contour after the
coal is mined, but much or most of the dirt and rock is left in the
streams and valleys.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA spokesman said the rule allowing the dumping was an effort
to establish a regulatory environment that was fair and fostered
"good environmental stewardship." Since when is illegal destruction
of streams good environmental stewardship?</TE>
<TE>   Let's call it what it was: legalizing permanent ruin of the
countryside to temporarily, very temporarily, increase coal
production and fatten the coffers of mining companies.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Terror Network Is Still a Threat, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Military: American commander declares that Al Qaeda and the
Taliban remain viable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda and the Taliban are on the run, but they retain a powerful
network of arms, money and determined fighters that continues to
compel U.S.-led anti- terrorism forces to prepare for further major
offensives, the American commander of coalition troops said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   That assessment by Army Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck in an
interview contrasted with the upbeat forecast of the top British
officer here a day earlier, who proclaimed the campaign to eradicate
terrorists from Afghanistan "all but won."</LD>
<LD>   "There's still a lot of work to be done to get Al Qaeda and
Taliban killed or captured, as a lot have been pushed into
neighboring countries," said Hagenbeck, who oversees the
17,000-strong coalition deployment in this country.</LD>
<TE>   Smaller, more focused search-and-destroy operations have dominated
the agenda in recent weeks, after the March execution of Operation
Anaconda loosed the most fearsome firepower yet in the global battle
against terrorism waged in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian-led mission, Operation Torii, wrapped up this week
after combing the Tora Bora area, site of a major battle in December.
The allied forces found human remains buried with honors but have yet
to determine whether they belong to Osama bin Laden or other senior
Al Qaeda operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Snipe, under British command, has scoured the mountains
of Paktika province in the east for the last two weeks to locate and
seize weapons cached by the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But with Al Qaeda and the Taliban still capable of mounting
suicide offensives and undermining the tentative stability recently
achieved in Afghanistan, the coalition must remain at sufficient
strength to mount Anaconda-level offensives if necessary, Hagenbeck
said.</TE>
<TE>   His outlook on the security and defense needs here reflected the
views recently aired by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that
much work remains to destroy enemy command and control networks.</TE>
<TE>   But Brig. Roger Lane, who commands the 1,700 British troops based
at Bagram, hinted that Operation Snipe was a cleanup mission and a
prelude to bringing at least some of the troops home.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, which has 850 soldiers in Afghanistan, has also been
reviewing its deployment level with an eye to scaling back, now that
politicians and taxpayers perceive that the shooting war seems to be
over. Defense Minister Art Eggleton said Monday that maintaining
current troop strength in Afghanistan beyond this summer would be "a
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, however, is far from ready to set an exit date and
remains convinced that much needs to be done in the way of
strengthening security and defeating extremism, Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the military activity underway now is aimed at
preventing Al Qaeda and the Taliban from launching fresh assaults,
the enemy remains active and influential in some areas, making it
imperative that coalition forces avoid letting their guard down, said
the general.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to maintain capabilities to execute small-scale and
large-scale missions," he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. air power has backed up both the Torii and Snipe missions,
but most of the American activity lately has been directed at
tracking suspected terrorists crossing into and out of Afghanistan
along the largely unguarded border with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the resources to determine when and how Al Qaeda or
Taliban forces in neighboring countries try to reenter Afghanistan,"
Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that their presence in the region constitutes a threat
even if they are not physically in this country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've hurt them. We do have them on the run. But they
maintain command and control capacities and are working hard to
recreate an environment in which they can train more soldiers," he
said, pointing to recent intelligence reports of Al Qaeda operatives
showering villagers in targeted areas with money and other
inducements for support.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition civil affairs workers are waging their own
hearts-and-minds campaign in volatile regions such as the lawless
southeast, but Hagenbeck conceded that the fiercely independent
tribes far from Kabul, the capital, are not going to be won over
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether a CIA-ordered strike this week on a recalcitrant
Afghan warlord, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, could undermine popular support
for the U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, Hagenbeck said he
couldn't discuss the work of "other agencies" but added that the
military side is usually informed ahead of such actions.</TE>
<TE>   The Monday missile attack from an unmanned Predator aircraft,
which missed Hekmatyar, marked the first time in the Afghan operation
that U.S. operatives targeted an enemy outside of the Al Qaeda and
Taliban ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition forces are charged with aiding the interim government of
Hamid Karzai and creating conditions that will help determine the
future leadership of Afghanistan, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   With Al Qaeda still armed, organized, in search of havens and new
recruits, "we're here till we're done," Hagenbeck said of the
anti-terror effort.</TE>

<HD>Saudi Urges a Crackdown on Suicide Bombings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>As Israel massed military forces near the Gaza Strip, Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister said Friday that the Palestinian Authority must
share the burden of ending the 19-month-old conflict by cracking down
on militants responsible for targeting Israeli civilians with suicide
bombings.</LD>
<LD>   "Both sides must stop doing what they are doing in order for
anything to happen," Prince Saud al Faisal, the foreign minister,
told Western journalists here in comments that mark a shift away from
the Arab tendency to universally blame Israel for the wave of
bloodshed. "For one side to stop alone and the other to be left to do
anything he pleases is not going to do the job."</LD>
<LD>   Much of the Arab world is weary of warring between the Israelis
and the Palestinians. The Saudis, Egyptians and Jordanians have been
trying to find a formula that will bring it to an end. Officials in
all three nations say they have pressed Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat to rein in radical Islamic groups responsible
for suicide bombings.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the foreign minister repeated a common belief among Arab
leaders that if peace is to take hold, Israel must resist the urge to
retaliate in the face of suicide attacks and the United States must
push the Israelis to be patient.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority has been devastated by a recent Israeli
military offensive in the West Bank, he said, and he argued that it
must be given time to rebuild its security forces. Then, the Saudi
said, he has no doubt it will act to crack down on militants.</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime there must be restraint on the part of Israelis,"
Saud said.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from Washington, Arafat publicly condemned suicide
bombings after an attack Tuesday on a pool hall near Tel Aviv killed
15 Israelis, making his statement in Arabic, as demanded by the White
House. He followed up with the arrest of 16 Hamas militants, though
leaders of the group said the detainees were lower-level members.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Abdullah, recently met
with President Bush and is scheduled to brief Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Egypt today on that session. Syrian President Bashar
Assad also is expected to attend. Though the discussion is aimed at
trying to push forward the peace process, there is also concern over
a possible Israeli attack on Gaza in response to Tuesday's bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak this week sent a letter to Bush asking him to help prevent
an incursion, and another letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon warning that an attack so close to the Egyptian border would
be fraught with danger.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Saudis and Egyptians believe that the Bush
administration is asking more of Arafat than the Palestinian leader
can provide, the foreign minister emphasized that the kingdom is
pleased with Washington's recent efforts that helped free the
Palestinian leader from house arrest in Ramallah and end the Israeli
siege at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. He said he hoped
the same U.S. effort would be extended toward stopping an Israeli
campaign in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign minister's comments are part of a concerted effort to
reposition Saudi Arabia in terms of public perception. After the
Sept. 11 attacks, and news that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi
nationals, the kingdom's strict form of religious government came
under intense criticism from the West. Since then, the Saudis have
tried to appear more moderate, a strategy that even some of their
Arab friends argue is merely a calculated bid to improve relations
with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders meeting in Beirut on March 28 approved a Saudi peace
plan that would have their nations recognize Israel in exchange for
an Israeli withdrawal from territory seized during the 1967 Middle
East War. But Israeli troops invaded Palestinian areas of the West
Bank the following day in response to a suicide bombing.</TE>

<HD>As Calm Settles Over Balkans, NATO to Withdraw 12,000
Peacekeepers</HD>
<DH>Europe: Most of the cuts will be in Bosnia. But a large
military presence will remain for years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>With the situation in the Balkans more stable than in several years,
NATO announced Friday that it is cutting its troops by 12,000, about
20% of the total force in the region.</LD>
<LD>   The largest reduction is to be in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is to
lose about a third of its peacekeepers by year's end, reducing by
7,000 troops the current total of 19,000.</LD>
<LD>   In Kosovo, where the situation is less stable, troop strength
would drop by about 4,800, leaving approximately 33,200 soldiers in
the ethnic Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.</LD>
<TE>   In Macedonia, where there has been sporadic fighting, there are
about 700 North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, however, the cuts are among the largest in the
multinational peacekeeping forces in the region since the first
soldiers came into Bosnia in 1996, according to NATO officials.</TE>
<TE>   Peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo after the 1999 NATO-led air
campaign against the regime of former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, whose forces expelled hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians and are estimated to have killed more than 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Since the former Yugoslav federation began to break apart in 1991,
the region has been plagued by a series of violent ethnic and
religious wars, which in Bosnia killed more than 200,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent conflict was last summer's fighting in Macedonia
between ethnic Albanians who said they wanted more rights and the
ethnic Macedonians who dominate the country.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction to the announcement of the troop reduction from
Balkan analysts and government officials was muted, in part because
the situation is calmer and because NATO appears still committed to
keeping a large number of troops on the ground for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to escape two conclusions: There is a devaluation
of Southeastern Europe ... and conditions have stabilized
considerably in Bosnia, and in Kosovo they are inching towards
normality," said Simon Serfaty, director of the European program at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Bosnian Foreign Ministry said the NATO downsizing was "in line
with NATO's decision to harmonize its presence in Bosnia with new
circumstances" and added that officials had been assured that Balkan
security would continue to be a NATO priority.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had
previously pushed hard for a sharp reduction in the number of
American troops in the region and more involvement by Europeans, but
that seems to have moderated somewhat since Sept. 11 with the
discovery of a likely Al Qaeda cell in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery underscored the need for intensive intelligence
gathering in the region. Bosnia, whose population is roughly half
Muslim, has several hundred moujahedeen fighters who have lived in
the region since the 1992-95 ethnic warfare in the country. Some of
them are believed to be radical and potentially supporters of
terrorist activities. In addition, the nation has porous borders,
making it easy for people to enter and leave.</TE>
<TE>   Six foreign nationals, including an Algerian who reportedly was in
communication with a key lieutenant of Osama bin Laden, were arrested
earlier this year and flown to the U.S. base at Cuba's Guantanamo Bay
for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a series of terrorist threats against the U.S. and
British embassies in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, that were serious
enough to force the closing of both missions. In addition, the Bosnia
Stabilization Force, or SFOR, has been involved in searching several
Islamic charities that operate in the country for information related
to terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as you keep the key intelligence functions in Sarajevo,
there is room for troop reductions," said Mark Wheeler, Bosnia
director of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based
organization that studies conflict.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 U.S. soldiers are serving in Bosnia, and Pentagon
officials have said privately that they expect a reduction roughly
proportional to the overall troop reduction in the country, or about
a third of the U.S. force. The number of U.S. troops leaving Kosovo
was not yet clear.</TE>
<TE>   The troop reductions will be complete by the end of 2002, but
other streamlining could continue into 2003, NATO officials said.</TE>

delivered more than 11,020 signatures to the National Assembly,
demanding a referendum for broad changes in Cuba's socialist system
less than two days before a visit by former U.S. President Carter.</LD>

<LD>Hong Kong has charged three political protesters with organizing an
unauthorized rally, the first such prosecutions since the territory
returned to China.</LD>
<LD>   The charges could trigger a new legal battle over the Public Order
Ordinance, which requires protesters to seek prior police approval.</LD>
<LD>   Hong Kong's Basic Law, the 50-year mini-constitution enacted in
1997, guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, procession and
demonstration. Leung Kwok Hung, 46, Fung Ka Keung, 23, and Lo Wai
Ming, 27, are accused of failing to seek police approval for a Feb.
10 protest against the jailing of a social worker.</LD>

<LD>   On state television, Castro called on U.S. officials to "present
even the most minimum proof."</LD>
<LD>   Castro's speech was the Cuban government's first detailed response
to the charges U.S. Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton made
Monday during an address to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group in Washington.</LD>

<LD>With his sister and a former comrade in attendance, an American
bomber pilot was buried with full military honors near Cambridge--57
years after his plane crashed over the east coast of England during
World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Lieut. Col. Earle Aber, of Racine, Wis., died in March 1945 after
his B-17 "Flying Fortress" was accidentally hit by British guns as he
flew over Clacton.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Aber managed to maintain control of the aircraft
long enough to allow nine crew members to parachute to safety. But he
died with his co-pilot, Maurice Harper, when the plane crashed into
the River Stour at Harwich. A salvage team recovered the wreck two
years ago.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PAKTIKA PROVINCE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In a thunderous blast heard and seen for miles, coalition forces blew
up four caves Friday packed with tens of thousands of rockets, shells
and grenades that once belonged to the Taliban--and were apparently
still being used.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no way they'll be able to go in there and use those caves
now," said Sgt. Iain Murison, as a huge dust cloud spread across the
desolate hills and valleys of southeastern Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   About 220 pounds of plastic explosives, fortified with anti-tank
mines, were set off by remote control after people were evacuated
from within a mile of the caves.</LD>
<TE>   Ordnance inside the man-made caves continued to explode for hours;
at least three rockets shot out and whizzed across the sky.</TE>
<TE>   British forces discovered the cache earlier this week. The caves
are 6 to 9 feet high and about 100 to 150 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Some caves were sealed shut with metal doors, but at least one was
left open.</TE>

<HD>Bombing Ignites Anger in Russia</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Suspicions rest on separatists from Chechen
republic as death toll rises to 41.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At a time when world attention has been riveted on events in the
Middle East and Afghanistan, the continuing drip, drip, drip of
carnage on Russia's southern rim rarely gets noticed.</LD>
<LD>   But the bomb filled with nails, nuts and bolts that ripped apart
schoolchildren and Russian army musicians in the republic of Dagestan
on Thursday, fatally wounding 41 people during a moment of national
celebration, is not likely to be soon forgotten in Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   President Vladimir V. Putin immediately blamed Islamic extremists
who have been waging war in neighboring Chechnya, and vowed that they
would be treated like the Nazis whom Russia and its Western allies
eradicated in World War II.</LD>
<TE>   The bombing occurred just as Putin was addressing a parade in
Moscow's Red Square to mark Victory Day, a commemoration of the
triumph over Nazi Germany that remains one of Russia's most
meaningful and emotional holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Russia is used to being widely criticized in the West for human
rights abuses in Chechnya. However, it believes the U.S. should start
to get behind its campaign against extremists in the Caucasus. That
is a message Putin will be reinforcing to President Bush at a Moscow
summit later this month, several analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's public comments of condolence to Russia are a sign that he
is coming around to Putin's viewpoint and is starting to see the
Chechen conflict, which has frequently spilled over into Dagestan and
other neighboring republics, as part of the wider war on terrorism,
said political analyst Liliya F. Shevtsova of the Carnegie Moscow
Center think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "One should not expect any U.S. pressure on Moscow to expedite a
peaceful end of the Chechen conflict any time soon," she concluded.
On the contrary, the bombing in the Caspian seaside town of Kaspiysk
"will only cement the existing rapport between Washington and Moscow"
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The official death toll in the bombing rose Friday to 41,
including 17 children. More than 90 people still were hospitalized,
Dagestani officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities reported that some suspects had been arrested for
questioning in connection with the bombing. The Federal Security
Service was leading the investigation, and local residents were
reportedly coming forward with tips on possible suspects.</TE>
<TE>   An amateur videotape played on television showed children
frolicking behind a military brass band Thursday morning, followed by
a sickening shudder and a cloud of smoke. The children and musicians
suddenly come into focus again--this time as piles of bleeding bodies
lying on the pavement as survivors scream in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being inured to terrorist acts in the northern Caucasus
region, Russians were thrown into stark fury.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who committed the crime should be brought here, put
right in the place where it happened, and then be cut into pieces, so
that they themselves would experience the same pain," one indignant
woman in Kaspiysk told the NTV television network.</TE>
<TE>   "For many people, this act of terror is and will be the most
painful experience of their entire lives, an experience never to be
forgotten," Kaspiysk Mayor Dzhamaludin Omarov, a former police
colonel, said in a phone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally can still hear the screams and see the dead bodies
in my mind's eye," he said. "The entire town is in mourning."</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion immediately came to rest on the separatist movement in
neighboring Chechnya or its sympathizers in Dagestan. The separatists
have been waging a war against Russian police and soldiers since fall
1999. In recent weeks, Russia claimed to be making headway,
trumpeting the death of an Arab commander, Khattab, who was
reportedly killed with a poison-laden letter.</TE>
<TE>   Russian policy toward separatists is already harsh, including
repeated roundups and arrests in Chechnya. Human rights groups have
reported "disappearances" of young men from villages there. But if
the bombers thought the attack would bring them closer to their
goals, just the opposite may be true, said Shevtsova.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of peace, the terrorist act will spur the federal
authorities to intensify the campaign aimed at knocking out the
remaining Chechen warlords," she said. Such a brazen attack "makes a
peace deal indefinitely remote."</TE>
<TE>   Dagestan's envoy in Moscow, Ramazan Magomedov, said he wants to
see prison sentences for terrorist acts extended beyond the current
five to 10 years. The masterminds behind Thursday's crime, he said,
were most likely Islamic extremists with ties to international
terrorist organizations, and they may already have escaped to
Chechnya or elsewhere in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander I. Zhilin, a Moscow-based military analyst, said he
believed the attackers may have been influenced by the tactics that
some Palestinians have adopted against Israel--trying to inflict
maximum suffering on a more militarily powerful foe.</TE>
<TE>   "The terrorist act in Kaspiysk ... will only make the authorities
more determined to finish the rebels off as soon as possible," Zhilin
said. "The country has been waiting for this for way too long, and
now it is high time."</TE>
<TE>   However, he doubted that Russians would long remember the bombing.
After a few weeks, they will simply block it out, as they have many
other bitter experiences, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If Russians were to commemorate every single tragedy that occurs,
then most of the calendar would have been colored black a long time
ago," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Speaks Softly About Youth Sex</HD>
<DH>Conference: Strong endorsements of sex education programs
are blocked by the U.S. and conservative allies such as the Vatican.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The United States, the Vatican and a few conservative Islamic allies
forced last-minute changes in a declaration adopted at the close of a
three-day U.N. meeting on children's issues Friday, including the
removal of what they perceived to be indirect references to abortion
counseling for adolescents.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration failed to get the United Nations to
endorse sexual abstinence as the best way to prevent sexually
transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy among teenagers. But it
succeeded in deleting strong endorsements of sex education programs
that had been supported by a large majority of the 181 nations
participating in the meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "A World Fit for Children," the 26-page conference document
outlines 21 commitments to improve children's health and education
and eradicate child prostitution, child labor and the recruitment of
children for combat.</LD>
<TE>   "Look, it wasn't always easy, but the governments of the world got
where they had to get," said Carol Bellamy, director of the United
Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, which sponsored the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   By tradition, U.N. conference statements are adopted by
acclamation, though member states can append their "reservations"
regarding specific passages to the final document. But U.S. delegates
had threatened to scuttle the entire declaration unless it reflected
the Bush administration's staunch opposition to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also succeeded in watering down references to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was endorsed without
dissent by the General Assembly in 1989 and has now been ratified by
every U.N. member except Somalia and the United States, where some
conservative groups consider it an infringement on parental
authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of the document is very positive, but in regards to
reproductive health and children's rights the language is exceedingly
weak, and this is due entirely to U.S. pressure," said Adrienne
Germain, the president of the International Women's Health Coalition.
The U.S. position ultimately prevailed, Germain and some African and
Latin American delegates here said, because of concerns by poor
nations and international charities that defiance of Washington could
trigger cuts in critical U.S. financial support.</TE>
<TE>   European governments, already at odds with the White House over
issues ranging from global warming to Saddam Hussein, tried to keep
the children's forum from turning into another battleground over
policy differences with the United States. In an effort to reach
compromise, the European Union dropped its earlier insistence on an
unequivocal condemnation of capital punishment for minors, which is
permitted in some U.S. states.</TE>
<TE>   Among the countries balking at both the U.S. demands and the
proposed European compromise were Canada, Norway, Japan and--more
surprisingly--Latin American nations, which once were aligned with
the Vatican in birth control and sex education disputes at U.N.
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the middle was UNICEF and Bellamy, its director, one of
the few Americans in the U.N.'s top echelon. Some leaders of
children's rights and women's health groups criticized UNICEF for
sidestepping the dispute on abortion and birth-control counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy stressed what she saw as the many positive achievements of
the conference. For the first time, she noted, a U.N. meeting on
children's issues included substantial representation from children
themselves: More than 200 youth delegates participated in planning
and debates, often offering blunt criticism of their elders.</TE>
<TE>   Health groups unveiled initiatives here to fight malnutrition and
dehydration among young children in poor countries. Gordon Brown,
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, threw his support behind an
ambitious debt-forgiveness plan for poor nations, Bellamy said.</TE>
<TE>   But she acknowledged frustration at how abortion had overshadowed
every other issue, and she bridled at accusations from some
antiabortion activists that UNICEF promoted abortion. "We do not
support abortion," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But UNICEF does support children's health programs in countries
where abortion--and abortion counseling for minors--is legal. And the
aggressive promotion of condoms, contraceptives and sex education is
the cornerstone of juvenile AIDS prevention programs throughout the
developing world that UNICEF aids. Much of the dispute here took the
form of debate over perceived "code words" in a nonbinding document
few people will ever read.</TE>
<TE>   For the antiabortion activists represented in the U.S. delegation,
the term "reproductive health services" implied endorsement of
abortion as one birth-control option for adolescents. After failed
efforts to amend or footnote the phrase, it was dropped entirely.</TE>
<TE>   The original declaration draft referred to "various forms of the
family"--common in U.N. documents on social issues. The U.S. sought
to have "family" explicitly defined as one derived from "marriage
between a man and a woman." But this was objectionable to European
officials whose constituents include many single-parent families and
unmarried couples with children, and the Americans backed down.</TE>
<TE>   American advocates for children's rights said they were heartened
by U.S. positions on other issues, such as child labor prohibitions.
While the administration opposes the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, U.S. delegates said it would seek Senate ratification of two
optional side agreements to the convention, one banning the use of
child soldiers, and the other criminalizing the trafficking of
children for prostitution.</TE>

<LD>For five weeks, Palestinian gunmen occupied the Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem, surrounded by Israeli troops. The church,
revered by Christians as marking the birthplace of Christ, became a
focal point of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israelis,
seeking to end suicide bombings in Israel, demanded that the gunmen
surrender. The Palestinians, cut off from supporters and outraged at
the Israeli invasion, hunkered down behind the massive walls.
Clergymen of the three Christian faiths that share the church also
stayed through the ordeal. Carolyn Cole, a Times photographer,
followed a group of Palestinian sympathizers as they slipped into the
church eight days before the siege ended. These photographs document
what she saw inside.</LD>

church, which is shaped like a cross, are covered with paintings of
Christ, the Virgin Mary and Moses. Many are oils, and some are
decorated in gold and silver leaf.</CP>

the custom of leaving shoes outside their homes, they placed them at
the end of the rugs they were sleeping on. The rugs, to stave off
cold on the stone floor, were provided by clergymen.</CP>

Christian services were held in a grotto revered as the birthplace of

<LD>An Algerian man with alleged links to Osama bin Laden should be
extradited to the U.S. to face trial on charges that he masterminded
a plot to blow up Los Angeles International Airport, a judge ruled
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In August, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Amar
Makhlulif, 37, also known as Abu Doha, and prosecutors described him
as a key figure in Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorism network.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. prosecutors allege that he developed a plan to bomb LAX
during celebrations to usher in the year 2000 and helped send
would-be terrorists to training camps in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The extradition ruling can be appealed, and Makhlulif's defense
team was considering the possibility. The final decision on
extradition lies with Home Secretary David Blunkett.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb plot was foiled in December 1999, when police arrested an
alleged co-conspirator, Ahmed Ressam, while he was trying to enter
Washington state from Canada in a car loaded with explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam was convicted last year on nine charges, including
smuggling and terrorist conspiracy, and could face a life prison
term.</TE>
<TE>   In hope of reducing his sentence, Ressam is testifying against
others.</TE>

<HD>26 Gunmen Cross Into Gaza</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians freed from Bethlehem church say
they're ready to fight Israelis again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>One by one, the 26 Palestinian gunmen walked across the checkpoint at
Erez on Friday and into the covered causeway that thousands of
Palestinian workers once passed through on their way to jobs in
Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The gunmen were heading the other way, into the Gaza Strip, sent
here from the West Bank city of Bethlehem as part of a deal that
ended a five-week standoff between Palestinians and Israelis at the
Church of the Nativity.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the militants vowed that they would soon pick up arms
against Israel again.</LD>
<TE>   "We will fight until the liberation of our land," said Mazen
Hussein, 28, who added that he was a fighter with the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia linked to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's mainstream Fatah organization.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein said he was setting foot in this Palestinian area for the
first time. "Now, we'll be fighters with our friends in Gaza," he
said. "In the bus coming down here, the Israeli soldiers said to us,
'We are coming to Gaza next.' Let them come."</TE>
<TE>   But inside Israel, debate over an assault on Gaza intensified
Friday. "Senior Officers Question the Wisdom of Gaza Operation" was
the provocative front-page headline on Haaretz, and other newspapers
wrote similar stories.</TE>
<TE>   Haaretz military correspondent Amos Harel reported that the
Israeli government was under pressure from the Bush administration to
limit its response to a suicide bombing Tuesday that killed 15
Israelis at a pool hall near Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Senior officers, he said, feared that an incursion would lead to
high casualties on both sides and would scuttle international efforts
to bring about at least a temporary lull in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Senior reserve officers, Harel said, have been outspoken to the
media and in internal debates over the planned operation.</TE>
<TE>   "They said unlike Defensive Shield, which was perceived as
necessary, going into Gaza will break the public consensus," Harel
reported, referring to Israel's massive military sweep through the
West Bank last month.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, President Bush on Friday welcomed the end of
the Bethlehem siege, even as he and other officials warily watched
the Israeli buildup around Gaza. U.S. officials are particularly
concerned that a new Israeli incursion could produce retaliatory
violence that would slow efforts to calm the Middle East conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We're watching carefully. We're in touch with [the Israelis]. But
obviously the decisions are theirs," said a senior State Department
official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Bush expressed guarded optimism during a fund-raiser in Columbus,
Ohio, for Gov. Robert A. Taft and the state Republican Party, calling
events in Bethlehem "positive news in a troubled region."</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen from the Church of the Nativity said they believe that
Israel will attack Gaza and that they will again find themselves
locked in battle.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 Palestinians sought refuge in the church April 2
after Israeli forces, responding to a suicide bombing that killed 28
Israelis during the Passover holiday, moved into Bethlehem. As part
of the deal ending the siege at the church, 13 gunmen wanted by
Israel were sent into exile overseas and the 26 others were sent
here.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security officers met the 26 gunmen at the Erez
crossing Friday and escorted them to the Cliff Hotel, on the coast in
Gaza City. There, some of the men knelt to kiss the ground, and each
received a hero's welcome. The men fired into the air with assault
rifles handed to them by passersby. Onlookers chanted and clapped.</TE>
<TE>   Their arrival boosted spirits among Gazans as they braced for an
Israeli assault, and it fueled anger with Arafat and his Palestinian
Authority. Many in this hotbed of Islamic militancy view the
Palestinian leader's decision to send the 13 militants into exile as
an act of treachery. Although Israel has periodically deported
Palestinians since it captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
1967 Middle East War, it never before did so with Palestinian
consent.</TE>
<TE>   "We are totally against it," said Ismail abu Shanab, a leader of
the militant Islamic movement Hamas. "It is illegal under
international law to deport a person from his native land; his
struggle is one for existence. We know that Israel wants to deport us
from our land."</TE>
<TE>   But Hamas canceled protest rallies it had planned for Friday in
Gaza City and the Jabaliya refugee camp. Hamas sources said leaders
decided that it would be unwise to bring tens of thousands of
militants into the streets in such a tense situation. The Palestinian
Authority arrested 16 low-level members of the movement Thursday, and

Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   The Kholifa Mosque in what passes for Jabaliya's main square was

<TE>   The camp, home to more than 100,000 refugees, is a Hamas

Israeli incursion, fortifying the warren of homes and meager shops by
piling mounds of sand in the roads, which some said have been
booby-trapped.</TE>

<HD>Chernobyl Gets Glowing Reviews</HD>
<DH>Travel: Visitors can see rare horses and breathe
surprisingly fresh air in a strange twist on adventure tourism at the
site of reactor disaster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MYCIO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>CHERNOBYL, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>Yuri Zayets pointed his binoculars toward a distant copse of birches
and shouted excitedly from midway up the fire tower: "They're over
there, grazing near the forest."</LD>
<LD>   It had taken nearly two hours of driving through the unique
radioactive wilderness born of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to
find them, but one of the world's few wild herds of rare Przewalski
horses finally came into view.</LD>
<LD>   "Stay here," Denis Vishnevsky, a zoologist with the Chernobyl
Ecology Center, said after the group of official guides and a
journalist piled out of their minibus to see the short but powerfully
robust horses, introduced here in 1998 to eat what was supposedly
"excess" vegetation in the depopulated area. "They'll come to us."</LD>
<TE>   "Chernobyl safaris," mused Rima Kiselytsia, a guide with
Chernobylinterinform, the agency that shepherds all visitors to the
"Zone of Alienation" around the now-decommissioned reactor, an area
that once was home to 135,000 people. "It's a strange idea, but I
like it."</TE>
<TE>   Chernobyl tourism has been a hot topic in Ukraine since January,
when a U.N. report urged Chernobyl communities to learn to live
safely with radiation--such as consuming only produce grown outside
the zone. The report suggested specialized tourism as one of several
possible ways to bring money into a region that has swallowed more
than $100 billion in subsidies from Soviet, Ukrainian and
international government funds since the nuclear accident 16 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the town of Chernobyl, where the zone's administration
manages the Rhode Island-sized no man's land around the destroyed
reactor, one official said economic benefits of tourism will never be
more than minor.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't reject the idea outright. "The U.N. is 12 years too
late," said Mykola Dmytruk, deputy director of Chernobylinterinform,
referring to technicians who have been coming to the zone for that
long. "We've been allowing tours since 1994."</TE>
<TE>   A few Kiev tourist agencies advertise Chernobyl excursions on
their Web sites, but so far the zone administration doesn't actively
promote the idea. "A great deal still isn't known," said Dmytruk,
"and we warn everyone about the risks, even scientists."</TE>
<TE>   The risks, though small, are real. And so is the desolation. But
the aftermath of the accident has created a misleading stereotype of
the zone as a toxic wasteland, a nuclear desert devoid of life, and
certainly not a place a sane person would want to visit.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, by ending industrialization, deforestation, cultivation
and other human intrusions, radiation has transformed the zone into
one of Europe's largest wildlife habitats, a fascinating and at times
beautiful wildness teeming with large animals such as moose, wolves,
boar and deer. It now is home to 270 bird species, 31 of them
endangered--making the zone one of the few places in Europe to spot
rarities such as black storks and booted eagles.</TE>
<TE>   And traveling to Chernobyl may qualify as a kind of adventure
tourism. The very knowledge of the buzzing background of radiation
imbues even the prosaic act of walking down the street with an aura
of excitement. It isn't the same adrenalin punch as bungee jumping in
the Andes, but it is a palpable sensation--like being surrounded by
ghosts.</TE>
<TE>   By law, no one can enter the zone without permission. But except
for children under 17, the administration may give permission to
pretty much anyone. The vast majority of the nearly 1,000 annual
visitors are scientists, journalists, politicians and international
nuclear officials, but the zone has hosted a handful of what Dmytruk
calls "pure" tourists--including three Japanese in 2000--and it can
put together customized programs, such as safaris in search of
Przewalski horses, which some experts believe are the ancestors of
all domestic horses but far more aggressive..</TE>
<TE>   "If a group of Californians want to go bird-watching, we can
organize that," Dmytruk said, adding, "so long as they know the
difference between plutonium and potatoes."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Chernobyl isn't Club Med. But 16 years after the fourth
reactor bloc spewed radiation around the globe, the risks are mostly
manageable. About a quarter of the cesium and strontium have already
decayed, and 95% of the remaining radioactive molecules are no longer
in fallout that can get on or inside a visitor, but have sunk to a
depth of about 5 inches in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   From there, they have insinuated themselves into the food chain,
making the zone's diverse and abundant flora and fauna radioactive
indeed. An antler shed recently by a Chernobyl elk was stuffed with
so much strontium that it cannot be allowed out of the zone. But
three Przewalski foals born in the wild, though radioactive, have
grown to adolescence with no visible effects.</TE>
<TE>   Such radioactivity now has receded to the background. On an
average day, a visitor might receive an extra radiation dose about
equivalent to taking a two-hour plane trip, zone officials say.</TE>
<TE>   That is, if the visitor follows the strict but simple safety
rules: "Don't eat local food, stay on the pavement, and go only where
your guide takes you," Dmytruk said.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost impossible to smell fresher air in an urban setting
than here in the town of Chernobyl, where the number of cars seen on
a warm April day could be counted on one hand and songbirds
frequently provide the only sound.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one of the zone's many paradoxes, but because human
activity is banned nearly everywhere, the region is one of Ukraine's
environmentally cleanest," Dmytruk said. "Except for radiation."</TE>
<TE>   Today, villages are slowly succumbing to encroaching forests. In
the abandoned town of Pripyat, less than two miles from the nuclear
reactor, empty black windows stare blindly from high-rise buildings
at kindergartens littered with heartbreakingly small gas masks.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem like an odd place for a rewarding tourism experience.
But nowhere else can a visitor stand amid a herd of wild Przewalski
horses like a character in Jean Auel's Ice Age novels, or watch a
pair of rare white-tailed eagles circling above the ghostly
high-rises of Pripyat, a moving monument to the devastating effects
of technology gone awry and nature's near miraculous resilience and
recovery.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>POTTERS BAR, England</DL>
<LD>A high-speed train derailed Friday on its way through a station north
of London and one car crashed onto the platform, scattering waiting
passengers. Seven people were killed in the accident and nine
seriously injured, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   At least 45 others suffered less severe injuries, British
Transport Police said.</LD>
<LD>   The northbound London-to-King's Lynn train, carrying 151 people,
went off the tracks in Potters Bar, a quiet suburban town 12 miles
north of London.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses reported a deafening bang and passengers flung out of
windows as part of the four-carriage train plowed over the platform
at Potters Bar.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a bang and saw the train mount the platform. After that,
there was screaming and chaos everywhere," said Andy Perversi, on the
platform when the crash happened at lunchtime.</TE>
<TE>   The train car came to a halt, lodged under the station roof.</TE>
<TE>   Inspector Philip Trendall of the British Transport Police said it
was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash. It was one of
six fatal accidents since 1997 that have raised concern about the
safety of British rails.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Statements in L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's May 8 letter
concerning the invasion of the Metropolitan News-Enterprise's offices
on May 2 are false. Jo-Ann Grace had agreed to send copies of our
business records to a district attorney's investigator relating to
three legal advertisements we had published. The agreement was
predicated on a subpoena being sent. We did not renege on our
agreement because no subpoena was ever provided. Instead, a search
warrant was served--something at which any newspaper would balk.</LD>
<LD>   The statement that "Roger Grace refused to comply with the court
order" is false. There was no court order to turn over documents.
There was a search warrant, authorizing a search. No effort was made
to block investigators from searching. Our staff was locked out for
three hours while armed investigators set up camp in our offices. Our
afternoon daily consequently got on the streets three hours late.</LD>
<TE>   Cooley's statement that "the newsroom at the Metropolitan News was
not violated" is disingenuous. No part of the office had yet been
searched by investigators at the time we turned over the documents.
(We did so after learning from Cooley that he already knew the
identity of the law firm that placed the notices, meaning our
customer did not need protection of its identity.) Investigators
spent the time going from room to room, diagraming what was where. We
have a 30,000-square-foot spread, and investigators estimated a two-
to three-day search.</TE>
<TE>   The intent to search the newsroom was plain. Aside from an
investigator's stated intention to search the entire office, and a
statement made by a deputy district attorney who was on a speaker
phone with Cooley that drawers of reporters' desks would be searched,
the warrant itself, procured by Cooley's office, evidences the
intention. It says: "The search is to include all rooms ... files,
[and] desks" and expressly mentions containers in the "editing"
department.</TE>
<TE>   Searches of newspaper offices can result in government
investigators seeing unpublished material, including notes that
reveal the identities of confidential news sources. That's why
Congress acted to prohibit such searches except under extremely
narrow circumstances. It is "unlawful for a government officer or
employee, in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a
criminal offense to search for or seize" materials "possessed by a
person in connection with a purpose to disseminate to the public a
newspaper...." The search warrant was invalid. Cooley exercised poor
judgment in connection with his raid on our office.</TE>

<TE>   Jo-Ann W. Grace</TE>
<TE>   Co-Publishers, Metropolitan</TE>
<TE>   News-Enterprise, L.A.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the district attorney executed a search warrant at the
Metropolitan News-Enterprise and shut down the paper's newsroom, it
was the public that suffered the most. An informed public depends on
a free press. The press cannot operate under threat that government
agents may routinely search reporters' desks. If newsroom searches
were permitted, sources would be reluctant to provide reporters with
information for fear that the information, and potentially the
sources' identities, could end up in the government's hands.
Recognizing these dangers, Congress and the California Legislature
passed laws to prohibit most newsroom search warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Cooley's claims to the contrary, the Metropolitan News
search warrant was far too broad and never should have been issued,
let alone executed. It targeted not only the paper's advertising
offices but also editorial offices and even reporters' desks, purses
and wallets. The D.A. was not looking for a suspected killer, but for
records regarding the publication of recall notices for South Gate
elections. The press must be able to acquire and publish this
information without being exposed to newsroom searches by government
agents. By shutting down the newsroom, the D.A. has done harm to
important constitutional values and to the public his office serves.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Needs a Symbol, Not a Sign</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It struck me while reading "Hollywood Sign Caught in Secession Tug of
War" (May 6), about the squabble over possession of the Hollywood
sign, that its pathetically sad history tells volumes about Los
Angeles. Is that the best symbol this great metropolis can produce?
How it pales in comparison with the Golden Gate Bridge, the Statue of
Liberty, the Eiffel Tower or the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio
de Janeiro.</LD>
<LD>   It seems to me that Los Angeles is finally beginning to show signs
of becoming a truly world-class city and that it should be able to
come up with something better than a sign originally used as a real
estate promotion. A few years ago, artist Brett-Livingstone Strong
proposed an ambitious project, the "City of Angels Monument," that
has apparently disappeared off the map. I cannot say whether it was
the best of all possible proposals but I hoped that it at least would
have started some serious discussions about the concept.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever one of our sports teams wins a title, it seems everyone
within 50 to 100 miles is suddenly a loyal Angeleno--and we don't
hear as much about seceding from the city. A symbol comparable to
those of other great cities in the world could possibly accomplish
the same thing, except that rather than for just the season, or a
year, it could instill a permanent sense of pride in being part of
this city.</LD>

<TE>   I have seen no reporting on how ownership of the Hollywood sign
will affect the city of Los Angeles' ability to appoint members to
the Hollywood Sign Trust. Also, the trust has a contract with a
company to license rights to the sign for use in postcards, movies,
TV shows, etc. The contract is worth thousands of dollars annually.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Local Agency Formation Commission sets the boundaries,
I hope there is a follow-up story on Los Angeles' interest in the
Hollywood Sign Trust and the economic effect that a change in
ownership of the sign would mean to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
and others.</TE>

<TE>   Why not draw the boundary of the proposed new city of Hollywood
where the famous Hollywood sign is? That way, both L.A. and Hollywood
could claim bragging and marketing rights to the landmark and share
maintenance duties as they see fit. What better way to materialize
the historic link between the two cities?</TE>

<LD>Re "Israel, an Indispensable Haven," Commentary, May 8: Walter Reich

Palestine and kill all young Palestinian men and women and have the

They might as well also give up the dream that Israel will ever
negotiate to give them their own state on what Israelis say is their
land. It's pretty clear that any Israeli leader who would negotiate a
Palestinian state would be put out of office or even, as we have
seen, be assassinated. The only way the Palestinians could get their
own state would be for the United States to threaten Israel with
military action to force it to give up the land. Since that's not
going to happen, what's now to become of the Palestinians? Perhaps
the Palestinians, realizing their situation, should try to negotiate
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for full Israeli
citizenship. Israel, the only democracy in the Mideast, should be
happy with 3.5million new, smiling countrymen.</TE>

<TE>   The illegal arrest on May 5 of American humanitarian aid workers
Dr. Riad Abdelkarim and Dalell Mohmed demonstrates Israel's complete
contempt for the United States and our citizens. It's amazing that we
continue to give billions of dollars of taxpayer money to subsidize a
country that will turn around and arrest Americans, including
physicians on a humanitarian mission, without any plausible
justification. With friends like Israel, who needs enemies?</TE>

<LD>Re "Dress the Part, Teachers," editorial, May 5: I request that The
Times visit my high school in South Gate and see our deplorable
working conditions. We have a school built for 1,500 that holds 4,600
day students and an equal number of adult students every working
24-hour period of the calendar year. Our plant is a mess. It's old,
it's dirty. The floors are filthy. The desks are broken, with gum
stuck under every one. The classrooms are used by day students and
then night students.</LD>
<LD>   Why should I wear a tie and $100 slacks when the items I wear get
soiled? Forty of our seniors were accepted at UCLA. Obviously we are
teaching something, even under adverse conditions. So come visit my
classroom. I offer you an open invitation--any time.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I was in high school I knew a teacher who enjoyed dressing in
comfortable clothes, and it made the students happy because they felt
they could relate to the teacher. The T-shirt and jeans my teacher
wore made it seem like there was no distinction between the students
and that particular teacher, but this made me uncomfortable. I
believe that teaching is an important career and one must take it
seriously. Much like in a job interview, the way teachers choose to
dress in the classroom shows a lot about the way they are and the way
they teach.</TE>
<TE>   It's sad to know that schools like Mount Vernon Middle School have
teachers worrying about the clothes they are going to wear instead of
concentrating on how to make their students learn. School is supposed
to be for education and not a fashion statement.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "No Plans, No Graduation Rite, Seniors Told," May 7: Allowing the
Los Angeles school system's local District C (covering the southwest
Valley) high school seniors to participate in graduation ceremonies
only if they're committed to secondary education or training is, as
one student put it, "nonsense."</LD>
<LD>   Graduation is a celebration of what has been accomplished, not of
plans for the future. The policy is coercion at best. In the
worst-case scenario, it punishes students who, for economic reasons,
must work after high school rather than attend college. Successful
college students are made by instilling in them a desire to achieve.
Arm-twisting is no long-term solution.</LD>

<TE>   District C Supt. Robert Collins says that the policy of denying
graduating high school seniors the right to participate in graduation
ceremonies unless they can show they are going on to college or into
the military is not "harsh." Clearly it is stupid, elitist, cruel and
disrespectful of individuality. He says the policy has increased the
number of students who say they will go to college. So what?</TE>
<TE>   Since when do the ends justify the means? Participating in a
graduation ceremony is most meaningful and most important for those
not going on to college. The policy is telling all students,
college-bound or otherwise, that respect for individual differences
does not matter to us as long as aggregate numbers somewhere can make
us look good. Is that what public schools should be teaching?</TE>
<TE>   Lee C. McDonald</TE>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a college graduate and the father of three children, two of
whom are college-bound and one of whom has been very successful
without college, I find the requirements discriminatory. Aside from
the obvious ethical considerations, they epitomize the bureaucratic
obsession with statistics. Officials say that college enrollment is
up. Who cares if the students actually attend? Who cares if they
actually succeed? No doubt some administrator will point with pride
to "marked improvement." Maybe someone will actually get grant money.</TE>

<TE>   Newhall</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My first reaction to your headline was an angry one. The
requirement smacked of arrogance and class consciousness. However,
upon reading the entire article, I gradually realized it was a clever
and subtle attempt to expose the students to possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The requirements for evidence of compliance were so flexible,
e.g., learning French in France, acceptance by a community college (a
procedure less rigorous than applying for a driver's license)--things
absolutely everyone could easily comply with, especially since
counselors were actively assisting them to do so. It is a sad fact
that most young people entering the work force with only their high
school diploma in hand will find supporting themselves a constant
struggle. Those a little better equipped will prosper more easily and
have a more fulfilling life.</TE>
<TE>   Simple exposure to a possibility could bring great changes in the
futures of these students. No, the educators are simply going one
step further in their attempt to give our children an education.
After all, commencement should be defined as a beginning, not an
ending, of learning.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Scott</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seniors who have completed all requirements for graduation surely
deserve the traditional honor of being recognized in the company of
their relatives and peers. Many kids might even benefit from having a
year or two to sort out things before committing to more years of the
academic grind. This move also cheapens the value of a high school
diploma. There are many who, later in life, struggle to get a GED
with pride. Why should we not honor those students who have fulfilled
all the requirements to graduate from high school?</TE>

<HD>Clerks Can Be Students of Life</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Schools' Use of Students as Clerks Draws Criticism," May 5: As
anyone who has ever gone to school knows, you learn very little in
the classroom. Class is generally something we wait for to end. Most
learning comes from independent reading, doing homework and working
through the conflicts inherent in all relationships--the ones with
ourselves and the ones with others.</LD>
<LD>   Students engaged in clerical tasks at school are lucky. They are
working alongside teachers and administrators, learning about
responsibility and about themselves from their contact with adults.
They are singled out as worthy individuals. We need to go much
further in engaging students in nonacademic school activities--for
example, requiring students to do community service in their schools
and neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Community service could mean cleaning up student-generated
graffiti and trash from school grounds and their neighborhood
streets, cleaning up their classrooms, hallways and lavatories and
helping in the lunchroom, where their meals are provided free. As
parents, if we ask our children to pick up their clothes from the
floor in their rooms, are we depriving them of their childhood? I
don't think so. The most important lesson we can learn is not the one
about a math equation but the one about responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   R.X. Stafford</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The use or abuse of student clerks dates back at least half a
century. I attended Fairfax High School in the late 1950s. The school
had a clever ruse for choosing only top students to "assist" the
staff--honor organizations called Alphas and Knights, for girls and
boys respectively. Students were chosen based on excellence in both
academics and extracurricular activities. I remember the thrill of
becoming an Alpha and receiving my bright-blue Alpha sweater; my
brother was dubbed a Knight.</TE>
<TE>   But the honor carried a price. We were required to spend one class
period as a "clerk" to staff members. With a six-period day, that was
a steep price. I still lament the fine course in Shakespeare my
friends took, while I ran errands for administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Today many schools offer seven or eight class periods. Some
students have fulfilled all requirements, or are taking five academic
courses plus music or art and still have a hole in their schedules. A
properly supervised "clerking" position can be beneficial but should
be graded differently--perhaps pass or fail. In times of strict
school accountability, we must remember that students are not
widgets. They benefit from careful exposure to a variety of learning
experiences.</TE>

<TE>   I am an eighth-grade student at Cubberley K-8 School in the Long
Beach Unified School District and a teacher's aide for an elementary
technology teacher. I completely disagree with your article. It does
not show the positive side of being a teacher's aide. At Cubberley,
being an aide is an optional activity. Students are removed from an
unnecessary study skills class to help a teacher of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   To be an aide, a student must go through a background check to see
if he or she meets the necessary academic requirements for the
position. During my time as a teacher's aide I have had nothing but
positive experiences. I help children from kindergarten to fifth
grade by answering questions about computer programs the students are
using.</TE>
<TE>   Even when I do not have students to aid (which happens when
teachers cancel or are on a field trip), I am always learning. The
technology teacher instructs me on the basics of Power Point. All in
all, being a teacher's aide is extremely fun and profitable if the
students meet the appropriate academic requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Stefan Kehlenbach</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree that it is bad when students are assigned as clerks or
service workers instead of taking academic classes they need and
want. There needs to be a limit on the number of semesters of credit
for this work. However, students can get valuable experiences by
working for a teacher or in an office. They learn to be responsible
and to relate well to others in answering the phone, running errands
and grading papers. Students who do not take business classes or go
into clerical careers can learn useful skills that will help them in
many jobs, and I have seen good teaching in these situations by
school office staff, teachers and administrators. Students usually
like the one-on-one attention that they get from a favorite teacher
or school secretary who becomes a mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers in high school and middle school do not get adult
secretaries. Rarely do we get aides. We have big classes and limited
time. Student helpers who assist us with clerical work and grading
papers allow us to spend more time working with students and planning
lessons.</TE>

<HD>Geffen's Gift to UCLA School of Medicine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was delighted to learn of David Geffen's generous gift to the UCLA
School of Medicine (May 7-8). While I was the undergraduate counselor
in the department of biology at UCLA, 90% of my students wanted to
attend medical school, and the majority hoped to be accepted at UCLA.
I know that some of my former students are now on the faculty at the
School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry and the Jules Stein Eye
Institute and are employed at the UCLA hospital.</LD>
<LD>   This brings to mind the new UCLA hospital, currently under
construction. Plans are afoot to name this beautiful edifice (I.M.
Pei, architect) the Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Because Reagan,
when he was governor, was a strong voice against both the University
of California and health care in California (particularly mental
health care), I feel that this would be a travesty.</LD>
<LD>   If every graduate of UCLA and all alumni who attended medical
school or interned or worked on campus or at the UCLA hospital
contributed enough money, this would not happen. I propose that if
Reagan's name is to appear anywhere, it should be on the parking
structure of the new hospital. Anyone who attended UCLA knows that
parking was the greatest barrier to receiving an education.</LD>
<TE>   Roxane Winkler</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Geffen's $200-million donation to UCLA's medical school is very
generous. The unrestricted fund, to be used to boost the current
endowment of nearly $600 million, will benefit the medical school. It
is certainly refreshing to see people with a lot of money making such
large contributions. But the choice for Geffen's donation is
baffling.</TE>
<TE>   Does UCLA really need more money? UCLA's current fund-raising
drive, initially intended to raise $1.2 billion by the end of this
year, has already raised $1.7 billion. In addition, $150 million was
pledged to UCLA for its new medical center, facilitated by Michael
Ovitz. Geffen says, "Los Angeles is my home, and I want to do my part
in contributing to its future."</TE>
<TE>   What he really means is the Westside. If people like Geffen and
Ovitz wanted to contribute to the future of Los Angeles (which
includes South L.A. and East L.A.), they would donate to
"non-white-collar" causes like community hospitals and trauma
centers, local public schools and organizations that help troubled
teens. Helping people get a decent education, find a job and avoid
drugs and crime would certainly do more for L.A. than padding UCLA's
already fat coffers.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How does a university thank someone for the promise of $200
million? The UCLA Medical School is not the first school to change
its name to that of the donor after receiving a multimillion-dollar
donation. If a million people donate $201 each, will UCLA then change
the name to the People's Medical School at UCLA?</TE>

<LD>I drive the 210 Freeway many mornings. I have seen many bumper
stickers and license plate frames proclaiming ideas and opinions that
range from the amusing to the asinine. Recently, I was behind a
vehicle whose license plate frame read, "Truth not tolerance." In
three words, all this world's bigotry, hate crimes, horrors of war
and genocide, as well as almost every other wrong inflicted by human
beings upon other human beings, was justified and rationalized.</LD>
<LD>   Does it not occur to people that if you want your belief system to
be respected, it is necessary to afford the same courtesy to people
whose belief system is different from yours? Believers in
Christianity, Judaism, Islam and all other faiths, even atheism, need
to let go of the need to feel "I am better than everyone else," stop
looking for reasons to be offended and work to respect other belief
systems.</LD>

<LD>Bernice Layne Brown, widow of the late Gov. Pat Brown and the mother

with her when she died. So were several of her 10 grandchildren.</LD>
<TE>   There were only three Democrats elected governor in California in
the 20th century, and Bernice Brown, a wife to one and a mother to
another, was close to the heart of the party for most of that time.</TE>
<TE>   Although she held strong private opinions, she was often willing
to stay in the background, providing essential behind-the-scenes
support for the Brown political dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   She was neat, meticulous and socially correct, but that didn't
mean she wouldn't speak her mind once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   She said that while Pat was off running successfully for attorney
general of California in 1946, she found herself left to handle the
family alone, and she resented it.</TE>
<TE>   "He was all over the state," she later told the Washington Post.
"I was at home with four kids, and I felt it put too much of a
problem on me. When they're babies, you can call the pediatrician,
but when they're teenagers, you have to make decisions, and I didn't
like having to make them alone."</TE>
<TE>   Later on, she campaigned for her husband and her son and was a
great asset for both.</TE>
<TE>   She said she learned a few tricks along the way, such as always
bringing along a change of clothes: "As soon as you don't, that'll be
the day someone spills coffee all over you on the plane."</TE>
<TE>   She also learned how to shake hands in a way to protect her
arthritic fingers: "Some of these knuckle-crushers can leave me
writhing on the floor in pain."</TE>
<TE>   Recalling when former state Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger was running
against her son for governor, she said Younger told Jerry Brown:</TE>
<TE>   "'Well, you certainly didn't inherit the Irish charm of your
father.' And Jerry came back very quickly. He said, 'Well, I may not
have inherited the Irish charm of my father, but I inherited the
fiscal frugality of my mother.'"</TE>
<TE>   She later told the Post reporter that Jerry was right on the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I still clip coupons," she said. "I hate myself for doing it, but
I really resent it if I feel I'm being cheated."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Pat Brown, an ebullient, old-style politician who
loved to slap backs and tell salty jokes, Bernice Brown was a model
of elegance and decorum.</TE>
<TE>   But her humor would still come through.</TE>
<TE>   One night at a 1960s political event in Sacramento, her husband
paid tribute to her before a large audience. When he unaccountably
stumbled on her first name, Bernice Brown interjected dryly, "his
wife of 32 years."</TE>
<TE>   A native San Franciscan, she was the daughter of a stern San
Francisco police captain, Arthur D. Layne, who wouldn't let her date
the 16-year-old Pat Brown when she met him in high school as a girl
of 13.</TE>
<TE>   But like so many Californians, Layne came to like the affable
young man with so many good stories to tell, and pretty soon the
police captain relented.</TE>
<TE>   From the time she was 14 and through her years at UC Berkeley,
where she graduated at the age of 19, Bernice frequently dated the
bright young man who became a lawyer without going to college.</TE>
<TE>   She became a teacher. At that time, young women who wanted a
teaching career were not allowed to marry until they finished three
years on probation.</TE>
<TE>   She decided that Pat Brown was worth more than that career, and on
Oct. 30, 1930, when she was 21, the two of them eloped to Reno.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns were married for 65 years, until his death at the age
of 90 in the same house where she died six years later. After his
funeral, she left the church in a wheelchair, her silver hair wafting
in the breeze as Jerry rolled her slowly to a waiting car.</TE>
<TE>   It was obvious to friends that Pat and Bernice Brown remained
devoted and supportive through all those years together.</TE>
<TE>   But on the day in 1975 that Jerry Brown was inaugurated as
governor, she had to make sure that Pat didn't steal any of their
son's limelight.</TE>
<TE>   When Pat wanted to speak publicly, she gently reminded him, "This
is Jerry's day."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Jerry and Kathleen, she leaves daughters Cynthia
Brown Kelly and Barbara Casey Siggins. She also leaves 10
grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral Mass will be celebrated at noon Monday at St. Brendan
Church in San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Letting Go of the Ego as the Key in Quest for Spiritual
Fulfillment</HD>
<DH>The Soul's Religion: Cultivating a Profoundly Spiritual Way
of Life; By Thomas Moore; Harper Collins: 297pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a society that honors material achievement and measurable success,
to be identified as a woman of substance or a man of means is to wear
laurels worthy of an Olympian god.</LD>
<LD>   Reaching our goals very often means we must be turned on, tuned in
and digitally connected. It means that get-togethers become
opportunities to "network." Conversation becomes not an avenue to
intimacy but a pick for mining the knowledge of others for what may
be useful for our own advancement.</LD>
<LD>   So why in our hot pursuit of income do we feel impoverished? If we
suffer from information overload, why are we not filled? Whatever
happened to the vaunted search for meaning by a generation of
seekers?</LD>
<TE>   Our problem, Thomas Moore tells us, is that we are spending our
time trying to fill ourselves when we should be emptying ourselves.
Those in too much of a hurry may write off the seeming contradiction
as so much doublespeak, an overly facile take on life best left at
the hot tub. But it is a koan worthy of a Zen master--and worth
repeating.</TE>
<TE>   In his latest book, "The Soul's Religion: Cultivating a Profoundly
Spiritual Way of Life," Moore treads a path that is at once familiar
and at the same time a discovery. Jesus said to seek first the
kingdom of God, and all other things would be given. Tao Te Ching
observed, "A foolish person tries to be good, and is therefore not
good." The Hopi pueblo people speak of a distant time when people who
were adrift on an endless sea stopped paddling and allowed themselves
to be guided by an unseen spirit. Only then did they find a livable
fourth world.</TE>
<TE>   We have a word for the impediment that blocks our spiritual path:
ego. It just seems to get in the way. Moore asks us to think how
emotions are transformed when one lets go of the ego. "Jealousy empty
of ego is passion. Inferiority empty of ego is humility. Narcissism
empty of ego is love of one's soul."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected things happen when we empty ourselves. Years ago in
Mexico I remember going out one evening onto a hotel veranda
overlooking the ocean. I was determined to think great thoughts. I
had an agenda. Let me say it--an ego. Moore would not have been
surprised to know that with my head full of self-importance I had not
an inkling of insight. Nothing was coming to mind. Finally, in
disgust I muttered the word "nothing." Quite accidentally, the
surrender to "nothing" opened a door to transcendence. Setting my
agenda aside, I stared at the incoming waves. These waves were
lapping the shore yesterday before I arrived, I thought--a year ago,
a century ago, a thousand years ago. Between their curl and their
breaking, the waves carried intimations of perfect peace and wordless
love. To my utter amazement there were no contradictions in the world
at all. Even ideas I "knew" in the real world to be contradictory
were somehow reconciled in a harmonious whole. That moment, not
repeated since, gently influenced my worldview. It came only when I
emptied myself.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's use of the term "emptiness" is what spiritual traditions
have long understood in focusing on the loss of self-consciousness.
But, Catholic that he is, spirituality is never to be sought for its
own sake, as some kind of cosmic diversion from the mundane. It is to
serve others in real and concrete ways. Such is the church's heritage
from Judaism. Along the way, Moore deals in short, concise chapters
with such issues as love, unbelief, eroticism, suffering, ordeal and
holiness.</TE>
<TE>   Many authors give spiritual advice with a whiff of the
marketplace, and Moore, for brief instances, seems not immune to this
scent. He speaks in the introduction of those who want to be
spiritual but have given up on organized religion, an observation
that comes dangerously close to pandering to popular disenchantments.
He speaks of redefining religion and having laid the foundation "for
a new approach to spirituality." Really? A new approach finally after
thousands of years of insights from saints, rebbes, divines, shamans
and enlightened ones?</TE>
<TE>   But Moore can be forgiven for this; one gets the impression he was
put up to engaging in a little hucksterism by a publisher intent on
selling books. Moore does laugh at himself and tries not to take
himself too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with Moore's previous works, including his
bestseller "Care of the Soul," know him to speak from experience
deeply rooted in failings and triumphs. Moore's successes came after
he failed to be granted tenure as a college instructor and was forced
to look anew at his life. He'd left home at 13 to join a Roman
Catholic religious order and left that, too, at 26. Here, then, is a
guide who is not perfect, but one who seeks to be perfected. The
pursuit of that perfection has meant making himself available to
others--and to otherness.</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards Injured Child $43.5 Million</HD>
<DH>Lawsuit: Boy was left brain-damaged after monitoring
devices in his hospital crib were either disconnected or turned off,
attorney says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury in San Bernardino has awarded $43.5 million to a 19-month-old
boy left brain-damaged after monitoring devices in his hospital crib
were either disconnected or turned off, his attorney said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Brown Jr., who was 4 months old when the incident occurred,
is conscious but only minimally responsive, said his family's
attorney, Bruce G. Fagel. Eric will never walk or talk and must be
fed through a tube because he is unable to swallow, Fagel said.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, before the trial began, Community Hospital of San
Bernardino admitted liability, leaving it up to the San Bernardino
Superior Court jury to decide the amount of damages.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital officials declined to discuss the case Friday, but they
issued a statement expressing sympathy for Eric and his family and
said steps had been taken "to prevent a situation like this from
occurring in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Fagel said most of the award will be used to provide
around-the-clock nursing care for Eric. The $5-million portion of the
judgment awarded by the jury for pain and suffering probably will be
reduced to $250,000, the maximum allowed under California law, Fagel
said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said the boy was admitted to the hospital in February
2001 with an upper respiratory infection.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not the sort of thing that should have given rise to any
major problem," Fagel said, "but his parents decided to stay with him
around the clock."</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, after the boy's condition improved, the parents,
Eric and Sara Brown, decided it was safe to return to their home in
San Bernardino. Fagan said Eric remained in his crib in the
hospital's pediatric ward, hooked up to sensors that monitored his
breathing and heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said that although a nurse says she left the infant
on his back and breathing normally, Eric somehow ended up on his
stomach. And for some reason, the monitors that would have sounded an
alarm if Eric's breathing or heartbeat failed were not attached,
Fagan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lying on his stomach, his breathing was impaired," Fagan said.
"We estimate there was some respiratory compromise for about 40
minutes, either breathing inadequately or not at all."</TE>
<TE>   The infant had turned blue by the time a nurse found him, Fagel
said. Eric was resuscitated and transferred to Loma Linda University
Medical Center, where specialists determined that he had suffered
hypoxic brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the severity of that damage, a neurologist recommended
that the child be allowed to die, Fagel said. The attorney said
Eric's parents agreed initially to a "do not resuscitate" order, but
later changed their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Round-the-clock nursing care was provided for Eric at the family
home after insurance carriers agreed to pay for four hours a day and
the hospital agreed to pay for the other 20, Fagel said. He said that
after the family turned down a $2.5-million settlement offer from the
hospital, the hospital stopped its payments.</TE>
<TE>   The trial of the family's lawsuit, which was filed last year,
began in April. The jury issued its verdict on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>James 'Buster' Brown, 88; Tap Dancer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran tap dancer, choreographer and teacher James "Buster" Brown
has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Brown died Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York
City. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   "Buster was so smooth as a dancer, he never showed any effort,"
tap historian Leonard Reed said Thursday. "Sometimes he looked like
he wasn't dancing at all, just floating in the air. He danced like
silk."</LD>
<TE>   Brown, described by the Calgary (Canada) Herald in 1996 as "the
small, wiry dancer with the thin mustache and two-tone tap shoes,"
was born in Baltimore on May 17, 1913, and learned tap on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "We taught each other," he said in a 1992 interview with the
London Sunday Telegraph. "We'd see a show at our hometown theater,
the Royal, we'd see a guy on stage, do a step and we'd steal it."</TE>
<TE>   At age 16, he and two friends from Douglas High School became the
Three Aces and later the Speed Kings, performing what he described as
a mix of acrobatics, tap dance and jive.</TE>
<TE>   As a solo tap artist, Brown toured with Cab Calloway, Count Basie,
Dizzy Gillespie and others, but he always spoke of working with Duke
Ellington as the highlight of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like going to heaven," he said in a 1999 interview in the
New York Amsterdam News. "He was the greatest musician to have ever
lived. He played very elegantly and I looked up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Brown became a member of the Original Hoofers
performing group and the Copasetics, founded in memory of tap legend
Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   And after a number of lean years for tap, when he made ends meet
as a clerk in a hotel and by cleaning buildings, Brown and other
aging tappers lent their dancing and teaching talents to a tap
rebirth in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   During this new flowering of tap, Brown danced on Broadway in
"Bubbling Brown Sugar" and "Black and Blue," on film in "Tap" and
"The Cotton Club," and on television in a PBS "Gershwin Gala" and a
"Dance in America" tap special. He also toured as a guest with
concert tap companies through the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Current tap phenomenon Savion Glover paid tribute to Brown's
influence in a major solo in his 1995 Broadway musical "Bring in 'Da
Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk," and Brown appeared locally with Glover in
"Foot Notes--the Concert" at the Wilshire Theatre in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing that performance, The Times wrote that "dancing to
'April in Paris,' octogenarian James 'Buster' Brown exemplifies the
sharpness and physical/spatial economy of classic Copasetics club
style: nothing wasted, except maybe some of the jokes between
numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Just this year, Oklahoma City University awarded him an honorary
doctorate and, according to Linda Sohl-Donnell, artistic director of
the Los Angeles-based Rhapsody in Taps company, he continued to
perform in, and host, a weekly jam session for tap dancers at the
Swing 46 club in New York until a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an inspiration and a very dear friend and supporter to tap
dancers of all ages," Sohl-Donnell told The Times. "He was also a
gracious and very positive human being, besides being a fabulous tap
dancer."</TE>
<TE>   To the end, Brown relished being an elder statesman of tap.</TE>
<TE>   "Dancing has taken me all over the place," he told National Public
Radio in 1999, "and I appreciate it and I respect tap dancing.... I
tell most of the kids that are coming up, I say, 'If you love
something, you must respect it. Don't do anything to put any smudges
in it, you know? Wherever you dance, leave something for the next
dancer that comes in, something clean, not anything derogatory.'
Remember that? Yeah."</TE>

<HD>Waltah Clarke, 89; Brought Style of Hawaii to Mainland
Fashion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waltah Clarke, who introduced Hawaiian apparel to the mainland in the
early 1950s and was once the nation's largest retailer of aloha wear,
has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Clarke, founder and president of Waltah Clarke's Hawaiian Shops,
died of heart failure Tuesday at a hospital in Rancho Mirage, where
he and his wife, Gretchen, lived the last 28 years.</LD>
<LD>   Clarke, a Los Angeles native who moved to Hawaii in 1938, opened
his first store in Palm Springs in 1952. By 1980, there were 31
Waltah Clarke Hawaiian Shops, including those in Laguna Beach,
Newport Beach, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Palm Beach and Chicago, as
well as 17 locations in Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Waltah Clarke's was the place to go for Hawaiian
shirts, swimwear and the ever-popular muumuu.</TE>
<TE>   "They took off like gangbusters," said Gretchen Clarke, who
designed most of the exclusive prints and garments for the company.
In the 1960s, she said, "we sophisticated the muumuu and made it into
more of a fashion garment--cocktail dresses and resort wear--and not
just a baggy dress."</TE>
<TE>   Their ad at the time said: "We've come a long way from the muumuu,
baby."</TE>
<TE>   And, she said, "When the miniskirts came in, we shortened it to
above the knee. We called it 'the mini muu.' All the young girls
bought it. We were innovative and kept up with the trends, but always
with the Hawaiian flair."</TE>
<TE>   "They were very capable business people, Waltah and Gretchen,"
said Tim McCullough, president and chief executive of Reyn's, a
longtime apparel retailer and manufacturer in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be credited with bringing what we would call today
luau kitsch to the forefront of the mainstream marketplace,"
McCullough said. "At the time, they were quite progressive. Their
designs and styling were done very tastefully for the period and
their product was very bold."</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Hawaii's Gov. John A. Burns awarded the Clarkes a special
citation of merit for their "substantial contribution to the economic
development of Hawaii."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Los Angeles in 1912, Clarke graduated from USC with a
liberal arts degree. He moved to Hawaii in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   "He flipped a coin--Paris or Hawaii--and Hawaii came up," his
widow said.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after arriving in Hawaii, Clarke met restaurateur Vic
Bergeron and learned the restaurant business managing the Trader
Vic's restaurant in Honolulu. Then Clarke met another legendary
restaurateur, Donn Beach, for whom he served as general manager and
publicity director for his Don the Beachcomber restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   An eye problem kept Clarke out of military service during World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Clarke became an official ambassador of aloha,
along with Duke Kahanamoku, for the Hawaiian Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke also began writing a weekly gossip column, "Hawaiian
Holidays," which appeared in the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago
Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's base of operations was the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, a magnet
for socialites and Hollywood celebrities whose activities he
chronicled. His business card read, "Royal Hawaiian Beach, 3rd
umbrella from the left."</TE>
<TE>   Heavily boosterish for the islands, which were a decade away from
becoming a state, Clarke ended each column with a weather report:
"Gosh!" he wrote in one, "The weather's been beautiful lately ...
typically winter, with bright blue skies, hot sun and spun-sugar
clouds. Just perfect for travel to the islands."</TE>
<TE>   "He learned the business of all things Hawaiian mostly from Don
the Beachcomber," said Gretchen Clarke. "He became so fascinated with
Polynesian life--the customs, the music, the flowers and the whole
attitude of Hawaii, the aloha spirit--he decided to bring that to the
mainland through stores."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, who always loved the desert, opened his first Hawaiian
clothing store in the landmark El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs in
1952.</TE>
<TE>   On a buying trip to Hawaii in 1953, he met Gretchen, a recent
Northwestern University graduate who had studied textile design, in
the lobby of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, where she and her parents were
staying. They were married the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's move into the El Mirador Hotel was "an instant success,"
said Gretchen Clarke. "We made enough money to keep opening stores
every year."</TE>
<TE>   When Disneyland opened in 1955, she said, "We were there." In
1956, they moved out of the El Mirador and opened a shop on Palm
Canyon Boulevard in Palm Springs, where it was a fixture for 36
years.</TE>
<TE>   After about 10 years of adding mainland stores to their chain,
Gretchen Clarke said, they opened their first store in Hawaii--at the
Ala Moana Shopping Center--and spread to the major hotels on the
outer islands.</TE>
<TE>   Waltah Clarke always handled the promotion and publicity for their
company.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke had changed the spelling of his name from Walter to Waltah
because that's how the Waikiki beach boys pronounced it when he
arrived in the islands. Clarke retired a decade ago, appointing his
wife president of the company while he continued to serve as chairman
of the board. They sold their last store, in Palm Desert, last year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his widow, Clarke is survived by children, sons
Walter Jr. of Honolulu, Rolf of Irvine, and Cameron of Washington,
D.C.; daughters Heather Salsbury of Los Angeles, Gretchen Clarke of
Eureka, Mont., and Cissy Milauskas of Los Angeles; and six
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held at noon Monday at Ramon Chapel at Palm
Springs Mortuary in Cathedral City.</TE>
<TE>   The family suggests that any donations be made to Tiempo de Los
Ninos at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs or the
American Cancer Society.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Cunniff, who had a distinguished career as a coach both in the
National Hockey League and in Olympic competition, has died. He was
57.</LD>
<LD>   Cunniff died Thursday night of throat cancer at Memorial Hospital
near his home in Albany, N.Y., USA Hockey officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A former head coach of the NHL's New Jersey Devils, Cunniff was an
assistant coach to Kevin Constantine with the team when he left in
February to battle the cancer.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Boston, Cunniff helped guide Team USA to a silver
medal in this year's Winter Olympics as an assistant coach under Herb
Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third straight time Cunniff had served in that capacity
at the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   He had worked for the Devils for the last 13 years, including a
two-season stint as head coach (1989-91).</TE>
<TE>   Cunniff guided the team to a 59-56-18 record and a berth in the
1990 Stanley Cup playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   He was also an assistant for the U.S. team that captured the
championship in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he coached on four U.S. national teams (1982, 1991,
1992 and 1993) at the International Ice Hockey Federation Men's World
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Cunniff also was on the staff of two U.S. national junior teams
(1992 and 1993).</TE>
<TE>   As a player in international competition, he was a member of the
1967 U.S. Men's National Team and the 1968 U.S. Olympic team at
Grenoble, France.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a forward at Boston College in the mid-1960s, he twice
earned first team All-America honors.</TE>
<TE>   He also played 12 years in the minor leagues, retiring in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Cunniff was set to receive the 2002 USA Hockey Distinguished
Achievement Award at the organization's annual President's Awards
Banquet next month in Colorado Springs.</TE>
<TE>   The honor will be given to him posthumously.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by four children and seven grandchildren. A funeral
will be held Tuesday in Boston.</TE>

<HD>Maverick N.C. Church Welcomes Lesbian as a Co-Pastor</HD>
<DH>Controversy: It may be the only Baptist congregation in the
South to have a gay co-leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONAT SHIMRON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A maverick church, known far beyond here for its willingness to take
a stand on controversial issues, has called a lesbian as its
co-pastor--possibly the only Baptist church in the South to do so.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Nancy Petty, formerly associate pastor at Pullen Memorial
Baptist Church, was elected co-pastor in April.</LD>
<LD>   The 192-59 vote, however, was memorable for its lack of discussion
about Petty's sexual orientation. Congregants at the 850-member
downtown church next to North Carolina State University were more
concerned with the model of dual leadership and whether it would be a
good way to run their church.</LD>
<TE>   Petty will share duties with the Rev. Jack McKinney, the
congregation's senior pastor for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "This day is only one piece of our journey together," said the
visibly moved Petty, 38, after the vote was called. "Our journey is
much longer, and it's about much more than this. The most important
thing to me going into this is my relationship with you. I hope we'll
continue to nurture our relationships with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Pullen's venture into what has become one of the most divisive
issue in the religious world today--the status of gays and
lesbians--is not new. Ten years ago, the church was expelled from the
Southern Baptist Convention for agreeing to hold a gay union
ceremony. Today, dozens of its members are gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   But the church is not a single-issue congregation. It has been at
the forefront of fights for desegregation, for women's rights and for
the end to the Vietnam War. Its tradition of strong preaching--by the
likes of Edwin McNeill Poteat, William W. Finlator and Mahan
Siler--have earned it a reputation far and wide as the South's
premier liberal church.</TE>
<TE>   It is also the church that launched the Alliance of Baptists, a
coalition of congregations that abandoned the Southern Baptist
Convention after conservatives reasserted control over the 16
million-member denomination.</TE>
<TE>   Still, members who took five months to deliberate knew the vote to
elevate Petty to co-pastor would be a momentous one, and they fully
expected the glare of the media and other Christian churches.</TE>
<TE>   A Baptist church led by two pastors is uncommon, and where it does
happen it usually involves a husband and wife. A Baptist church led
by a lesbian pastor and a heterosexual pastor is "extremely rare,
with the emphasis on 'extremely,'" said Bill Leonard, dean of the
divinity school at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. "I
don't know of another such situation."</TE>
<TE>   Most Christian groups either forbid the ordination of homosexuals
or require that they live in chastity. But Pullen--as a fiercely
independent Baptist church--has enjoyed the freedom to go its own
way.</TE>
<TE>   Petty arrived at Pullen in 1992 as a minister of Christian
education. A month later, she called Siler, the senior minister, and
asked him to meet her for breakfast at the Brownstone Hotel next door
to the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to tell you," Petty said. "I'm a lesbian. If I need to
step down, I will."</TE>
<TE>   Siler reached across the table, patted her hand and said, "We've
decided that question at Pullen. You're OK."</TE>
<TE>   "She's been with people through times of crisis and she's done a
lot of work with people one on one," said Pat Long, a member.</TE>

of the SUV, a 27-year-old Lake Forest man, will be cited.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leon Stein, 91, a composer, conductor and educator who was an
integral part of the musical life of his native Chicago for half a

solo and chamber works. His music has been performed by more than 90
orchestras, including those of Chicago, Boston, Detroit and
Cincinnati. His quartets were recorded by the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra String Quartet.</LD>

dean of the School of Music.</LD>
<TE>   He also was conductor of the DePaul University Orchestra
(1965-77), director of the Community Symphony of Chicago (1945-65),
director of the City Symphony of Chicago (1964-84), and music
director of the Niles Township Jewish Congregation in Skokie

<LD>Natalie B. Friendly, 75, former vice president of Ed Friendly
Productions, the television production company founded by her
husband, died of cancer Thursday at her Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.,
home.</LD>

Ingalls Wilder's "Little House on the Prairie" books, turning them
into the successful, long-running NBC series that starred the late
Michael Landon.</LD>
<LD>   She and her husband also were well-known on the Southern
California thoroughbred racing circuit and owned several winners
whose names included "Natalie," such as Natalie Knows, Another
Natalie, Not Another Natalie and Yet Another Natalie.</LD>
<TE>   A New York native, Friendly married Ed in 1952 and worked as a
model and actress before moving to Los Angeles with him in the 1960s.
She also was the author of two children's science books and was a
founding director of Neighbors of Watts. She joined her husband's
production company in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   She retired in the late 1980s and pursued genealogy projects,
writing a family history that won an award in 1999 from the Heart of
America Genealogical Society and Library.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel B. Leff, 67, founder and co-chairman of the Wall Street
investment management firm Forstmann-Leff Associates, died of cancer
Tuesday at his home in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   A native of the city, he attended the University of Pennsylvania
and Harvard Business School, graduating from the latter in 1961. He
worked briefly for Lazard Freres, then taught advanced economic
theory at Harvard.</LD>
<LD>   In 1968, he started his firm with Anthony Forstmann. The company,
which attracted money from union pension funds and private
individuals, was managing $4 billion in 1986 when a British
conglomerate, the Guinness Peat Group, bought Forstmann-Leff, but
Leff later bought the firm back. In 1997, it was sold to the Refco
Group, which deals in commodities and kept Leff and his management
team in place.</LD>
<TE>   Leff also ran Manhattan's Oblique Gallery, where he sold Art Deco
and Far Eastern antiques and paintings.</TE>

<HD>Sermons After Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Churches: Some ministers support calls for repentance, but
agree that such a tack may anger congregants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>G. JEFFREY MACDONALD</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>ACTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>According to the Rev. Ed Schroeder, Sept. 11 left all Christian
preachers with an enduring message to keep delivering: Repent, one
and all, for God is clearly angry with America.</LD>
<LD>   "The only way to fight when God is your enemy is to repent," said
Schroeder, a retired Lutheran theologian. "God is merciful to those
who repent. It says so through the whole Bible. But if the imperial
injustice persists, God finally presses the button: out."</LD>
<LD>   That might be true, said the Rev. Paul Sangree, but he's not about
to preach it from his pulpit at Bethany Congregational Church in
Foxboro, Mass. That's because the tragedy hit close to home when
hijackers took the life of the church's head deacon.</LD>
<TE>   "I think of what Ed said about this being God's judgment, but if
you've lost someone beloved of the church, a very strong Christian,
on Sept. 11, then it's a little bit harder to preach that," Sangree
said. "Would you say to the widow, 'God took your husband as a
wake-up call to America?' It's possible that this was God's wake-up
call to America, but I don't feel comfortable saying that to the
family."</TE>
<TE>   This exchange reflects one of many struggles Christian preachers
face in 2002. With so many questions lingering from Sept. 11, three
denominations brought 70 preachers together in late April at Acton
Congregational Church to examine what they can--or must--say when the
faithful gather in the long shadow of that fateful day.</TE>
<TE>   What emerged from liberals and conservatives in Lutheran, Roman
Catholic and United Church of Christ traditions was agreement that
America has ample cause to repent for sins ranging from
pleasure-worship to exploitation of Third World nations.</TE>
<TE>   But preachers also found common ground on a second point: Those
who preach repentance will surely face the people's wrath for
seemingly blaming the victim.</TE>
<TE>   Preachers in attendance disagreed about whether to construe Sept.
11 in hindsight as God's act of judgment to spur repentance.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder reminded the group that in the Bible, God uses Assyrians
and other enemies of Israel to punish and inspire change, adding that
God is doing so again today: "It's 'apocalypse now' after 9/11."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, the Rev. Scott Spencer said that to attribute
terrorism to God would "engender a lot of anger" at his Rehoboth,
Mass., Congregational Church. Instead, he said, "I went into my
funeral mode" and preached comfort for two months.</TE>
<TE>   Now, eight months after the incident, church attendance has
generally leveled off, and preachers see their people living at times
"as if nothing ever happened." Such normality among the flock is
disconcerting to shepherds, they say, because it seems that no
incident of any magnitude can cause Americans to turn from their ways
of overconsumption, indifference to poverty or unfettered
self-indulgence.</TE>

<LD>Most area police and sheriff stations are inaccessible to residents
after hours and do not have armed officers on site at all times,
according to a Ventura County Grand Jury report released this week.</LD>
<LD>   Grand jurors visited 10 stations during off-hours to judge safety
conditions. Those in Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai, Santa Paula
and Ventura lock their public lobbies by about 6 p.m. The stations
are not staffed with armed officers during nonbusiness hours; other
officers are on patrol.</LD>

<HD>Yves Robert, 81; French Film Actor and Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yves Robert, a film director, actor, writer and producer who made
intelligent, crowd-pleasing comedies and lighthearted films, died
Friday at his home in Paris. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Robert appeared in dozens of movies, often in small roles, from
orchestra conductor to bartender to defense lawyer. After turning his
focus to directing, he made 23 films, a few of which were remade in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   One of Robert's best-known movies is "Le Grand Blond Avec Une
Chaussure Noire," ("The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe"), a 1972
spoof on espionage films in which an unwitting absent-minded
violinist gets mistaken for a spy. Tom Hanks starred in a 1985
American remake, "The Man With One Red Shoe."</LD>
<TE>   Robert also made two films based on Marcel Pagnol's novels: "La
Gloire de Mon Pere" ("My Father's Glory") and "Le Chateau de Ma Mere"
("My Mother's Castle.") The 1990 films trace the adventures of a boy
and his family during summer holidays in sun-soaked Provence.</TE>
<TE>   Robert said he felt a link with Pagnol because of his own happy
childhood. "As a little boy, I was dazzled with happiness, dazzled
with life," Robert once said.</TE>
<TE>   Actors who starred in Robert's films called him fun-loving,
supportive and hard-working.</TE>
<TE>   "He fine-tuned things, he perfected things. He was really a man
with a passion," actor Jean Rochefort told France-Info radio.</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Richard, who appeared in several of Robert's movies, said
the director was "extraordinary with actors, because he was one
himself."</TE>
<TE>   "He was very attentive to actors, very concerned about their
well-being and their enjoyment," Richard told LCI television. "He
only gave good advice."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1920 in the Loire Valley city of Saumur, Robert started
his acting career with a theater troupe in Lyon. After appearing in a
few movies, he soon tried directing.</TE>
<TE>   His first hit was 1961's "La Guerre des Boutons" ("War of the
Buttons"), about a conflict between schoolchildren in two villages.</TE>
<TE>   Another successful film was "Un Elephant Ca Trompe Enormement"
("An Elephant Can Be Extremely Deceptive")--a comedy about a married
man who falls for a mysterious woman dressed in red. Gene Wilder
remade the movie in the United States as "The Woman in Red."</TE>
<TE>   The director made his last movie, "Montparnasse-Pondichery," in
1993 and occasionally took on small acting roles after that.</TE>
<TE>   Robert's funeral will be Wednesday at St.-Germain-des-Pres church
in Paris, according to Productions de la Gueville, the production
company he founded with his wife, actress Daniele Delorme.</TE>

<HD>Antivenin Stocks Depleted</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: Inland Empire doesn't have enough antidote to
treat even a single snakebite victim, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just in time for snake season, a widespread shortage of antivenin has
become so critical in the Inland Empire that health officials said
Friday that they do not have enough of the antidote left to treat
even a single snakebite.</LD>
<LD>   For a year, health officials across California have warned that
supplies of antivenin used to treat the bites of rattlesnakes and
other serpents are running low. The problem has been particularly
pressing in Southern California--which contains more snakes with more
venom than any other region of the state.</LD>
<LD>   Now, officials in the Inland Empire have concluded that supplies
of antivenin are effectively gone--that they do not have enough to
treat a single victim. More than two dozen people in the region are
hospitalized annually after being bitten by snakes, mostly
rattlesnakes.</LD>
<TE>   "The season is cranking up now as it gets warmer and warmer," said
Dr. Stuart Heard, executive director of the San Francisco-based
California Poison Control System. "People need to take responsibility
to protect themselves. They need to avoid getting bitten. This is
real."</TE>
<TE>   Worse, perhaps, is that health officials say this is the beginning
of a trend that will soon spread throughout Southern California and
the West.</TE>
<TE>   While it appears that no other area in California is suffering
from as severe a shortage as the Inland Empire, Heard said he expects
that other areas will be in similar straits by the summer's end.</TE>
<TE>   "It is headed in that direction," he said. "The stocks are really
low."</TE>

<HD>Pro-Israel Imam Praised by Jews, Decried by Islamic Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Religion News Service</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>These days, a rousingly pro-Israel talk before a Jewish audience
isn't news--except when it's delivered by a Muslim cleric, and in a
synagogue to boot.</LD>
<LD>   Sheik Abdul Hadi Palazzi, a Sunni cleric who spoke to synagogue
audiences in three Canadian cities recently, was hailed as a beacon
of sanity by Jewish groups, and condemned as anti-Islamic by the
Canadian Islamic Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Palazzi, an imam and secretary-general of the Italian Muslim
Assn., is known for his vocal beliefs that suicide bombings by
Islamic extremists are inimical to Islam and constitute fitnah, or
sedition. Thus, they are deserving of punishment.</LD>
<TE>   Among his other controversial views are that Israel should retain
control over all Jerusalem; that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
an unrepentant terrorist who will never make peace with the Jewish
state; and that the West is being hypocritical in its fight against
terrorism while it condemns Israel's military campaign in the
Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   In a strongly worded statement, the Canadian Islamic Congress, an
umbrella group for the country's 650,000 Muslims, called Palazzi an
"anti-Islam campaigner" whose speaking tour will inflame tensions
between Muslims and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The congress said the sponsor was "playing with fire" by having
Palazzi talk at a Winnipeg synagogue. In Toronto, where he spoke to
about 600 people, Palazzi dismissed the Islamic congress as "a branch
of Hamas," the militant Palestinian organization that has claimed
credit for a number of suicide bombings aimed at Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The 41-year-old cleric said Islam clearly forbids both suicide and
terror against civilians. "These are opposed to the dictates of
Islam, and it is the moral duty of Islamic scholars to speak out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And denying Jewish rights to Israel, including Jerusalem, negates
Islamic history, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arab national movement and the Zionists were allies after
World War I," he said, adding that Arab leaders at the time
"recognized the Koranic prophecy of the return of the Jews to Israel.
The Koran says the Jewish exile would not last forever."</TE>
<TE>   Today's many Muslim leaders in the Arab world, especially in
Palestinian-influenced areas, distort Islam's teachings, he charged.</TE>
<TE>   "We must denounce fundamentalist movements in the name of
Islam.... In behavior and policy, this is opposed to Islam. The
intifada is also condemnable under Islamic law."</TE>
<TE>   He also said Arafat "will never make peace, and it is absurd to
expect that [he] will fight terror."</TE>
<TE>   The sheik decried what he called the West's hypocrisy in the fight
against terrorism by criticizing Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Palazzi co-founded the Islam-Israel Friendship Society,
which promotes a positive Muslim attitude toward Jews and Israel.
John Esposito, author of "Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam"
and a professor of Islamic studies at Georgetown University, told the
Ottawa Citizen that Palazzi's Koran interpretations are "not
credible."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not too sure who, other than Palazzi, supports the position"
that the Koran endorses Jerusalem as an Israeli-held capital,
Esposito said. "I understand why Jewish groups like him--he's got a
good product to sell--but when you talk about top scholars on Islam,
I've never heard his name mentioned."</TE>

<HD>Death Threats Mailed to 6 Taft High School Teachers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six teachers at Taft High School in Woodland Hills recently received
written death threats apparently related to grades, Los Angeles
police said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   No suspects have been arrested, police said.</LD>
<LD>   A Taft teacher found six threatening letters in her mailbox on
April 11. One was addressed to her and the others were addressed to
five other teachers, according to authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Each anonymous letter stated that the teachers would be attacked
and shot in the head if they did not raise all of their students'
grades to Bs or A's.</TE>
<TE>   "We need these grades because if not, we won't be able to go to
college. And whose fault is that?" the letter reads.</TE>
<TE>   The letter asks for grade changes for all students, "even if they
are not in our gang."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department took over the case after an
initial investigation by school police.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if it was written by an individual or group, or if
it was designed toward one teacher or all of them," said LAPD Det.
Ron Robbins. "Right now it's just an anonymous letter."</TE>

<HD>Teens Cancel Out on Israel</HD>
<DH>Culture: The traditional rite of passage for many American
Jewish youths falls victim to Middle East violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amy Haber's long-anticipated journey to Israel was planned to let her
experience her Jewish heritage firsthand.</LD>
<LD>   What she experienced instead was a difficult choice: giving up her
trip or risking travel to an area plagued by violence.</LD>
<LD>   Like thousands of Jewish teenagers, she pulled out.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything's been put off for now," said Haber, 15, of Huntington
Beach, who had signed up with a group that has since suspended its
trip. She could have gone with another organization, but chose not to
this year.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, many Jewish teenagers have savored the rite of
passage of a summer trip to Israel, where they learn informal lessons
on Jewish history and heritage--standing on the exact spots where
Biblical events are said to have unfolded--and sample the customs,
sounds and tastes.</TE>
<TE>   But the escalating violence in the Middle East has persuaded many
Jewish youth organizations to cancel their trips, either because of
low sign-ups or security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all devastated that we're not sending our children," said
Joan Kaye, executive director of the Orange County Bureau of Jewish
Education.</TE>
<TE>   Only four families signed up to attend the bureau's six-week
program to Israel. A minimum of 25 are needed for the trip, and
financial assistance is provided for the journey, which can cost up
to $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israel trip is a major step for youths in connecting with
their Jewish identity," Kaye said. "Going as a high school student is
important, because it's the first time the kids are learning to be on
their own."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Haber had kept a list of souvenirs she would like to buy and
had prepared for the trip by brushing up on her Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   She had even thought about the personal note she would leave on
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. Now she has decided to
spend her summer hosting an Israeli student and participating in a
water polo league.</TE>
<TE>   Organizations such as Young Judaea, which has sent more than
30,000 teenagers to Israel, have seen turnout plummet this year.</TE>
<TE>   Only 16 youngsters have registered for the organization's summer
trip this year; it typically attracts up to 1,200 youths ages 15 to
18 each year.</TE>
<TE>   "The worst attendance it's ever been," said Andrew Yolin,
assistant director of Young Judaea, which has decided to go forward
with its trips.</TE>
<TE>   She said Jewish youths often "fall in love" with the country and
Israeli society on the trips. They participate in daylong outdoor
activities, including hiking, camping in the desert, archeological
digs and boot camp training.</TE>
<TE>   Some teens and their families think the eye-opening experience is
worth the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's more important to be in Israel right now more than
ever because the rest of the world needs to see that Jews and
Israelis aren't going into hiding from the violence," said Revital
Shoaham, 18, of Irvine, who will go in August for a year through a
Young Judaea program.</TE>
<TE>   "Wanting to be in Israel so much outweighs the fear of violence.
I'm sure once I get there, the reality of the situation will sink in
and I'll be scared," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who live there and see the violence around them still go on
with their daily lives. They just don't put their lives on hold. And
that's how I see my trip. I just can't put it on hold."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she plans to have her cell phone with her at all times so
she and her mother can stay in contact.</TE>
<TE>   Youth groups in the states work closely with Jewish security
agencies in Israel to ensure that the young American travelers are
not targets. Participants are not allowed to ride public buses and
must be accompanied by armed medics at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Summer months are a peak season for Americans to travel to Israel,
said Dana Kempler, western regional director of public relations for
the Israel Government Tourist Office.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's $3-billion tourism industry has taken a heavy hit because
of the escalating violence in the Middle East and the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in the United States, Kempler said.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two years, as violence in the area has escalated,
tourism has dropped by half, with an estimated 1.2 million Jews
traveling from the U.S. to Israel in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Adults have been somewhat less likely to cancel than teens,
according to the groups that set up tours in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents tend to be much more conservative when weighing the risks
for a child," Kaye said after an eight-day trip to Israel with 40
adults.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the random nature of the violence," said Sharon
Haber, Amy's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "If she goes, every report we'd hear of a bombing would just drive
us crazy. Not knowing her level of safety at each moment, it's just
too difficult."</TE>

<HD>Wilderness Bill Proposed</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Sen. Boxer seeks to add 2.5 million acres to
state's highly protected public land. Opposition is expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another 2.5 million acres of public land in California would receive
federal wilderness protection under legislation proposed by U.S. Sen.
Barbara Boxer--potentially the third-largest such addition in the
state since passage of the Wilderness Act nearly 40 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The wilderness bill, which Democrat Boxer plans to introduce next
week in the Senate, would ban logging, construction and motorized
vehicles in 77 areas of the state, ranging from the North Coast to
the Eastern Sierra and the Southern California desert.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of more than 200 groups has been working to gather
support for the proposal for several years, and backers say they have
assembled a broad range of endorsements, from recreational equipment
companies to sporting and environmental groups.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Boxer has no Republican co-sponsors and expects the Bush
administration to oppose the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what we're up against. I'm up for it," she said Friday.
"To me, California has always been about our state's intrinsic
beauty.... We want to make sure that when we have 50 million people
by 2025, we have places that are wilderness so people can see what
God created."</TE>
<TE>   About three-fourths of the proposed wilderness is in national
forests, 21% is in U.S. Bureau of Land Management holdings and 5% in
national parks. Although already protected by those designations, the
"wilderness" status imposes greatly heightened restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The largest tract, and potentially one of the most controversial,
covers 297,000 acres of national forest and Bureau of Land Management
land in the White Mountains just east of the Sierra Nevada, where
there is a vocal contingent of off-road vehicle users.</TE>
<TE>   Other additions would include:</TE>
<TE>   * 136,000 acres to the John Muir Wilderness in the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   * A number of tracts in Los Padres National Forest in Southern
California, including a 64,000-acre addition to San Rafael
Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would also give portions of 22 rivers protection
under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say their coalition, the California Wild Heritage
Campaign, has been talking to advocacy groups for years to fashion a
plan that would be acceptable to a range of interests.</TE>
<TE>   The 2.5 million acres outlined in the bill represent roughly a
third of the California land eligible for wilderness designation
under federal guidelines.</TE>

<LD>The FBI said it is investigating as a possible hate crime the death
of a homeless black man who was chained to a fence and set on fire.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma City Police discovered the burning body of Alonzo Bailey,

bound at the wrists, ankles, waist and neck, then covered with wooden
pallets that were set on fire.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI decided to launch its investigation after news reports
that a suspect arrested in the case, Anthony Lee Tedford, 43, bore
tattoos suggesting a connection with the Ku Klux Klan.</LD>

<LD>Gov. Bob Holden announced $83 million in funding cuts to state
colleges and universities and said 6,000 state employees will go
without pay for two days next month to help cover a budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   State money also will be withheld from nursing homes, social
services and job training, meaning the latest round of cuts could be
felt by thousands of people.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sorry," said Holden, a Democrat, as he blamed House
Republicans for the cuts. "Constitutionally I have a responsibility
to keep this budget in balance." He is trying to close an expected
$230-million gap in the $19-billion budget for the fiscal year ending
June 30.</LD>

<HD>EPA Targets Homes for Removal of Asbestos</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency plans to begin immediately
removing asbestos-laced insulation from hundreds of homes in the
small town of Libby.</LD>
<LD>   While the EPA has agreed to strip the hazardous insulation from
attics and from behind the walls of about 800 homes, aides to
Administrator Christie Whitman said they don't believe the agency
will be pressed into such action elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The EPA has been cleaning up asbestos-contaminated sites around
the former mining town in western Montana on an emergency basis since
1999. The agency had expressed reluctance to take on the task of
cleaning contaminated insulation from homes, at an estimated $3,000
to $20,000 per house, out of concerns that it might set a precedent
for homes elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   The asbestos contamination comes from a now-closed vermiculite
mine.</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Simpler Rules for Welfare System</HD>
<DH>Policy: As the House considers the issue, the president
says states and local governments need more flexibility in running
their programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Complaining about "a system that is too bureaucratic," President Bush
urged Congress on Friday to pass legislation he said would give
states greater flexibility in running welfare programs while
toughening work requirements for recipients.</LD>
<LD>   The House might vote as soon as next week on a bill that would
revise the landmark welfare law passed in 1996. Bush, in a speech
here, stressed the need to cut the rules Washington imposes on states
receiving federal welfare funds.</LD>
<LD>   "The more complicated the rules and regulations out of Washington,
the more states have to spend to account for this money," he said at
St. Stephen's Community House, which helps prepare welfare recipients
for work by providing vocational training and child care.</LD>
<TE>   "For the good of the people we're trying to help," he said,
"flexibility out of Washington--no-strings-attached-type
legislation--not only will help people, it'll be more efficient with
our taxpayers' money."</TE>
<TE>   The trip was Bush's third this week to politically important
Midwest states; his other stops were in Michigan and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   He travels to Illinois on Monday as he seeks to balance the public
attention paid to the Middle East and the war on terrorism by
focusing a presidential spotlight on the domestic policy issues that
often figure in voters' decisions.</TE>
<TE>   As he has frequently done this year, Bush mixed politics with his
stop in Ohio. He spoke at a luncheon that deputy White House press
secretary Scott McClellan said would raise $1.6 million for the
reelection campaign of Republican Gov. Robert Taft and $500,000 for
the Ohio Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   The president's argument that states and local governments should
have greater flexibility in running welfare programs goes to the
heart of his domestic policy agenda.</TE>
<TE>   It reflects a belief that Washington pays too much attention to
details better left to those actually executing social policy.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to trust local people. If you don't trust local
people, it means everybody in Washington is making the decision,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal welfare program was overhauled in 1996, when President
Clinton joined Republicans in an unusual bipartisan alliance.</TE>
<TE>   They produced a measure limiting the time a person can receive
welfare payments and brought about a shift in programs designed to
encourage recipients to move into the work force.</TE>
<TE>   That law expires Sept. 30. The House is likely to vote on a
five-year renewal Wednesday or Thursday; the issue has yet to come up
in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill, which closely follows recommendations Bush made in
February, would require states to guide 70% of adult welfare
recipients into work-related activities.</TE>
<TE>   The current law was supposed to set a 50% level, but the number is
much lower in many states.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I've heard [critics] complain about that's too high a goal,"
Bush said of the 70% figure. "It's not too high a goal if it helps a
person....If it brings dignity into someone's life, it's not too high
a goal."</TE>
<TE>   The critics say a number of factors will make it difficult for
states to reach the higher requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a dramatic decrease in the welfare caseload," said
Sheri Steisel, an official at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   "Those left face the greatest barriers. They're the ones who
couldn't make it in a good economy."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from facing a tougher economic environment, some welfare
recipients are handicapped by mental illness, substance abuse, low
literacy and the effects of domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill would limit the degree to which enrollment in
programs that deal with these problems is counted as work-related
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Steisel said the stricter requirements might force states to
increase the number of welfare recipients in community service
programs, increasing the public costs, rather than placing them in
programs intended to prepare them for private-sector jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Funding is also an issue.</TE>
<TE>   The House measure would offer the states a total of $16.5 billion
a year for welfare programs, keeping spending at the 1997 level.</TE>
<TE>   "While they ratcheted up requirements on the states to put people
into work programs, they provide no new resources," said Sharon
Parrott, co-director of welfare policy studies at the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Florida Family Premieres Medical Data Implants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>With a painless syringe prick in their upper arms, a Florida family
on Friday became the first recipients of tiny computer chip implants
that store medical information.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff and Leslie Jacobs, along with their 14-year-old son, Derek,
had the chips, about the size of a grain of rice, implanted in about
a minute under local anesthesia.</LD>
<LD>   The family wanted the implants in case of medical emergencies.</LD>
<TE>   The implant, called the VeriChip, was designed by Palm Beach-based
Applied Digital Solutions Inc. The chips are similar to ones
implanted in pets to identify them if they are lost.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Jacobs is a 48-year-old dentist who has suffered through
cancer, a car crash, a degenerative spinal condition, chronic eye
disease and abdominal operations. He is on 10 medications, and
doctors have told him they are not sure how long he will live.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing this as a security for us, because we've worked so
hard to save my husband's life," said Leslie Jacobs, 46.</TE>
<TE>   The Jacobs family's chips contain only telephone numbers and
information about previous medications.</TE>
<TE>   The VeriChip doesn't require batteries, and its data are read by a
scanner that can be Internet-connected to a medical record database.
Patients would pay a fee to keep medical information in the database
but would be able to manage their own records.</TE>
<TE>   For now, patients or their families would have to tell emergency
medical workers that a chip had been implanted, VeriChip officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the chips ever become commonplace, emergency workers might
automatically scan for the devices.</TE>
<TE>   Each VeriChip is expected to sell for about $200. A scanner used
to read its information would cost between $1,000 and $3,000.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Latino agents of the Customs Service filed suit in federal court
Friday alleging that the agency discriminated against them in hiring,
promotion, training and assignments.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed on behalf of more than 400 current and former
agents who contend that over the last 28 years they have been denied
promotions, gotten unpopular assignments and received inadequate
training, said their attorney, David Shaffer.</LD>
<LD>   Customs spokesman Dean Boyd declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Shaffer said the agents are seeking changes to Customs Service

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRANDON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>At least two dozen champion Yorkshire terriers and other show dogs
were killed in a fire sparked by a dryer used in their grooming,
officials say.</LD>
<LD>   A code enforcement officer who happened to be passing by spotted
the fire Thursday morning and pulled a woman who was trying to save
the dogs out of the burning home.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-six dogs survived the blaze. Firefighters revived some of
the animals with oxygen.</LD>
<TE>   Colleen and David Krug were raising more than 50 show dogs at
their home and showed many at competitions. The fire started in the
garage area where the Krugs had an industrial dryer for grooming the
animals, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are our kids, and we treat them as such," David Krug said.
"I loved all of them. There wasn't a dog I didn't pick up and hug
every night."</TE>
<TE>   Among the animals killed was a top silky terrier that produced
four champions in the last year. Two of those offspring also were
believed to have died in Thursday's blaze. Another silky terrier,
ranked 12th in the nation, survived.</TE>

<HD>Body in Mo. Is Not Missing Florida Girl</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>DNA tests have ruled out the possibility that a body found in
Missouri is that of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson, whose disappearance went
unnoticed by Florida child welfare workers for more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Miami police also said Friday that the two women who were caring
for Rilya had failed polygraph tests, although they would not
disclose the questions.</LD>
<LD>   "We can't take anybody at their word," Miami-Dade Police Director
Carlos Alvarez said. Asked whether charges against the women were
planned, he said: "Nobody is immune."</LD>
<TE>   Rilya has not been seen since January 2001, when she disappeared
from her Miami home. She wasn't reported missing until April 25,
after one of her caretakers said she thought a state worker had taken
Rilya away for tests.</TE>
<TE>   There had been speculation that Rilya was the beheaded girl whose
body was found last year in Kansas City. But police said tests on
saliva from Rilya's mother showed that a match with the girl
nicknamed Precious Doe was "scientifically impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Florida authorities offered a $25,000 reward Friday for
information about Rilya.</TE>
<TE>   "The DNA tests have provided a ray of hope that Rilya will be
found safe and well," said Tim Moore, state law enforcement
commissioner. "We're hoping that this will provide additional leads
that we can work on."</TE>
<TE>   Moore said detectives consider the case a missing child
investigation and are checking with other states and the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</TE>
<TE>   The state took custody of Rilya in 1996, when she was 5 weeks old,
because her mother was homeless and addicted to cocaine. The
Department of Children and Families failed to make required monthly
visits last year, but there has been finger-pointing about who in the
agency is to blame.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have said Pamela Graham was given legal custody of
the girl. She is the sister of Geralyn Graham, who claims to be
Rilya's grandmother. State officials have said the identity of
Rilya's father is in dispute and the girl's mother, Gloria Wilson,
has refused to disclose his identity.</TE>
<TE>   Geralyn and Pamela Graham say Rilya was taken from their home by a
woman who said she was a state worker.</TE>
<TE>   The Grahams have denied any wrongdoing, and their attorney, Ed
Shohat, disputed the findings of the polygraph tests. He said the
women were upset at the time of the test because police had just told
them that Rilya might be the slain girl found in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   There also were new questions about whether Geralyn Graham should
have been left alone with Rilya. In a 1997 deposition involving a
personal injury lawsuit, Geralyn Graham acknowledged setting a
kitchen fire when she fell asleep while cooking an egg.</TE>
<TE>   In the same case, Circuit Judge Norman Gerstein examined Graham's
criminal record and said: "She's got the paperwork of someone who has
scammed the system for many years. The flip side is that she's got a
25-year documented history of a major mental health problem."</TE>
<TE>   Shohat said he has not been able to talk with Graham's current
doctor to get an updated assessment of her condition.</TE>

<HD>Subordinates Were Relied On to Stem Abuse, Prelate Says</HD>
<DH>Church: Cardinal Law testifies for a second day. His
responses are related by a plaintiff and lawyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In his second day of testimony about an alleged cover-up of a sex
abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese, Cardinal Bernard Law on
Friday once again stated that he relied on subordinates to keep track
of a priest suspected of child molestation.</LD>
<LD>   A plaintiff's lawyer and an alleged victim of former priest John
J. Geoghan related their impressions of responses that Law gave at a
daylong deposition at the chancery here. Geoghan's conviction in
January on a single count of child abuse set off a crisis within the
Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   The session was closed to the press, and transcripts were not
available after Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney ruled late
Friday that Law will have 30 days to review the documents before they
are made public.</LD>
<TE>   Transcripts were e-mailed immediately Wednesday after the
questioning concluded, and Law reportedly was unhappy with media
depictions of his deposition. Faulting the lawyers questioning the
cardinal, an archdiocese spokesman, Father Christopher Coyne, on
Friday said, "They wanted to control how much spin was out there in
the media."</TE>
<TE>   Michael O'Donnell, a lawyer for two alleged Geoghan victims who
sat in on Friday's interrogation, said Law was asked what "management
tools" he used to ensure that no further abuse would take place after
Geoghan was transferred to a suburban parish.</TE>
<TE>   "And he responded that the management tool he had in place was the
trust and confidence that he put in his subordinates or Father
Geoghan's superiors," O'Donnell said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick McSorley, an alleged Geoghan victim who is one of 86
plaintiffs in a civil suit against Law and the archdiocese, dismissed
Law's replies as evasive.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of his answers were, 'I can't recall,' and he blew off the
truth, basically," he said. "He's just trying to take the problem and
move it away from himself."</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old unemployed electrician said Law reached out to
shake his hand as the session began Friday. McSorley refused.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't shake the man's hand because I knew what was about to
come was a lie," he said. "What do you expect? My episode could have
been prevented. Now he wants me to shake his hand? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   McSorley claims he was abused by Geoghan when he was 12 years old.
More than 130 people have accused Geoghan of molesting them during
his 30 years as a priest. Geoghan is serving a nine- to 10-year
sentence on a single charge of fondling a boy at a community swimming
pool.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual question-and-answer session marks only the second time
a U.S. cardinal has been deposed. In 1995, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
of Los Angeles was questioned about alleged sexual abuse in Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   Law was ordered to submit to questioning after a $15-million to
$30-million settlement proposed for the civil lawsuit abruptly was
withdrawn because the archdiocese said it could not finance the
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Garabedian, lead lawyer for all the plaintiffs, said he
spent 111/2 months negotiating the deal with lawyers for the
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Law's deposition continued Friday even as church officials
scrambled to reassure area Catholics that donations to a cable TV
station run by the archdiocese would not be used to finance
settlements with clerical abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   Boston Catholic Television, whose president is Law, has amassed
close to $31 million from investments and donations. The station
reaches about 1 million households in New England, airing papal
addresses, the Rosary and the daily Mass celebrated by the cardinal
at his residence.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published Friday in the Boston Herald, archdiocese
chancellor David Smith, who oversees financial affairs, suggested
that funds from the nation's largest Roman Catholic TV station might
help finance the mounting damage claims from victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a pot of money out there, [and] not to talk about it
would be irresponsible," Smith told the Herald.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, a taped message from Smith was running on Boston
Catholic Television, assuring viewers: "Your contributions to this
ministry, past and present, have been and will be used exclusively to
continue the work of Boston Catholic Television. None of the money
you have donated or will donate has been or will be used in the
outreach to the victims of clergy misconduct."</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian declined to discuss the proceedings Friday. But he said
he expects the cardinal's deposition to extend beyond Monday, when
the inquiry of the nation's senior Catholic prelate is scheduled to
end.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, a judge in Cambridge agreed to lower the bail of
Father Paul Shanley from $750,000 to $300,000. Shanley, 71, arrested
last week in San Diego, was arraigned Monday on three charges of
child rape.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating Mass on Friday in Boston's Roxbury section, Law made a
point of offering special prayers for healing and mercy in the midst
of the sexual abuse crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "We weep and we mourn, we grieve" for the sexual abuse victims,
Law said. "But we know that here in the midst of our mourning and our
grief, we must not be afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the chancery late Friday afternoon, McSorley voiced a
sense of impatience expressed by many alleged victims of clerical
sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see the cardinal for once just come out with some
truth," McSorley said. "We want some truth."</TE>

<HD>Lindh Seeks Counterpart in Court</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for John Walker Lindh want to question another U.S.-born
Taliban soldier at a pretrial hearing, but prosecutors said they must
await a decision on how other Al Qaeda and Taliban captives would
testify.</LD>
<LD>   A government finding released Friday said Esam Hamdi, born of
Saudi parents in Louisiana, falls in the same category as other
Taliban captives. If he agrees to testify at the July 15 proceeding,
an arrangement must be worked out for him to respond from a remote
location.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III has suggested that a video
hookup may be used for the captured soldiers. This would be a
compromise between the defense proposal for in-person questioning and
the government's suggestion of written questions and answers. The
judge scheduled a May 28 hearing to decide the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Ellis said no decisions would be made now on whether or how
military detainees would testify at Lindh's trial, which begins with
jury selection Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi was taken from the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
in April to a prison at the Norfolk, Va., naval station.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who grew up in California, was transferred by the military
to the criminal justice system and was indicted on charges of
conspiring to murder U.S. nationals, providing support to Al Qaeda
and other terrorist organizations and using firearms during crimes of
violence. Three of the eight counts carry a life term and the others
add up to a potential 90 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's attorneys will seek to show that he thought he was
fighting Afghan opponents of the Taliban and never thought U.S.
troops would be fighting in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue that Lindh had nothing to do with the murder of a
CIA agent during a prison uprising in November while he was held
captive in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi returned to Saudi Arabia with his parents when he was a
small child.</TE>

<HD>Bomb Suspect Held Without Bail in Iowa</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Wisconsin college student could spend the rest
of his life in prison if convicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Luke J. Helder appeared in an Iowa court Friday night to face the
first of several charges that could send him to prison for life for
allegedly blowing up mailboxes in the Midwest with pipe bombs.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old college student did not speak during the 10-minute
hearing, but he nodded as U.S. Magistrate John Jarvey read the
criminal complaint against him. He was ordered held in the Linn
County Jail without bail.</LD>
<LD>   Helder is charged in Iowa with using a pipe bomb in a crime of
violence and destroying property used in interstate commerce, a
mailbox. Six pipe bombs exploded in Iowa and Illinois last week,
injuring four letter carriers and two residents.</LD>
<TE>   The judge appointed Jane Kelly, a federal public defender from
Cedar Rapids, to represent Helder and scheduled a preliminary hearing
for May 22. Federal prosecutors said they would present evidence to a
grand jury this month seeking an indictment on both counts.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Helder is accused of putting 18 pipe bombs and
antigovernment letters in mailboxes in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska,
Colorado and Texas. He told authorities after his capture Tuesday in
Nevada that he wanted to create a "smiley face" pattern on the map, a
sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   Helder had been flown Friday from Nevada to this eastern Iowa
city. His parents, Cameron and Pamela Helder of Pine Island, Minn.,
left Reno on Thursday after a jailhouse visit with their son.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already been very hard on us," Cameron Helder said. "Our
heart goes out to the families of the victims and the victims."</TE>
<TE>   Helder, an art student at the University of Wisconsin at Stout in
Menomonie, Wis., had smiled broadly each time he was transported to
and from court and the Washoe County Jail in Nevada this week.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI zeroed in on him as a suspect after his father called
authorities about an alarming letter from his son containing
antigovernment statements and references to exploding mailboxes and
death.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM IDAHO FALLS</KH>
<HD>Publisher's Campaign Tests Ethics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>IDAHO FALLS, Idaho</DL>
<LD>When Jerry Brady launched his bid for Idaho governor, word of his
candidacy landed with a thud in the pages of his hometown paper, the
Post Register.</LD>
<LD>   "We like and admire Brady, but we wish he weren't a candidate,"
wrote opinion editor Marty Trillhaase. It wasn't that Brady is a
Democrat in the most conservative part of this deeply conservative
state. Nor the fact that Brady and Trillhaase disagree over abortion.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, the editorial umbrage was more personal: Until just a few
days before, Brady was Trillhaase's boss, publisher of the Post
Register and the one who approved virtually every word that appeared
on the opinion pages of Idaho's second-largest newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   Few give Brady much chance of unseating Republican Dirk Kempthorne
in November. But even so, the political leap by the 66-year-old
patriarch has placed a vexing burden on his staff.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists and their critics are forever debating questions of
bias, influence and political ax-grinding. But that discussion has
grown all the more acute in Idaho, a splinter of a state where the
Post Register--selling just 25,000 copies daily--plays a major role
in setting the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   At the paper, Brady's candidacy is not just a test of professional
ethics but also of human nature, forcing people to put aside their
feelings for their old boss and treat him like any other
candidate--without overcompensating and being too harsh either.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't wish it on anyone," said Roger Plothow who, as acting
publisher, has overseen numerous steps to assure readers of the
paper's integrity. Among them, an outside monitor has been hired to
regularly critique political coverage and issue a report card in
November. But, Plothow added, "it gives me far less heartburn because
I know this guy and respect his right to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Brady has severed virtually all ties with the paper since
announcing his candidacy last month. He surrendered his cell phone,
returned the company car and was taken off the internal e-mail
system. His office, redecorated with freshly hung curtains, is now a
break room for nursing mothers.</TE>
<TE>   He still draws a paycheck--approved by the paper's board of
directors--which bothers some. But Brady, who turned down lucrative
offers to keep the Post Register in private hands, said he needs the
money to get by: "My [other] choice was not run."</TE>
<TE>   Awkward as it is, Brady said he expects no special treatment from
his old colleagues, nor from the local TV station he co-owns and his
wife manages. Even before he started running, Brady showed he meant
it by keeping his intentions secret; as a result, his own newspaper
nearly got scooped.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't give it to them without preferring them over another
media," Brady explained.</TE>
<TE>   His candidacy is not that unusual, despite all the anxieties.
America's newspapers started as pamphlets reflecting the political
views of their owners, and that vigorous partisanship continued
through the Civil War. It was only with the advent of the telegraph
that fact-based reporting became the norm, shunting opinion to the
editorial pages where, for the most part, it remains today.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, editors and publishers have been leaders within their
communities. Some entered politics, including the legendary Horace
Greeley and Joseph Pulitzer. Warren G. Harding, a small-town
publisher in Ohio, was elected president.</TE>
<TE>   Brady is not alone this year in his political pursuit. The former
publisher of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Joel Kramer, is running
for lieutenant governor in Minnesota. Roy Brown, who heads a chain of
Ohio newspapers, made an unsuccessful try for Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The news coverage became an issue in that contest between Brown
and Mike Turner, the former mayor of Dayton. Turner filed a complaint
with the Federal Election Commission charging his fellow Republican
with improperly promoting his candidacy on the pages of his eight
weekly and two daily newspapers. According to the complaint, Brown's
newspapers carried 70 articles on the race over a two-month
period--only one of them favorable to Turner.</TE>
<TE>   The editor of one of Brown's papers released e-mails that had
instructions from the publisher's campaign manager. "Here are three
important Roy Brown for Congress releases," one read. "If you cover
the 3rd District, they must run."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's campaign did not return calls seeking comment. Turner won
Tuesday's primary in a landslide.</TE>
<TE>   It is just that sort of blot on the paper's credibility that
staffers in Idaho Falls are determined to avoid. (By contrast, TV
station KIFI, which Brady owns with his brother, has made no changes.
No one accuses the station of favoritism. But asked whether his wife
should step aside as general manager, Brady replied, "I'm not going
to make my wife quit her job over my decision.")</TE>
<TE>   At the Post Register, the paper has drafted a script for its phone
operators, routing calls for the Brady campaign to directory
assistance. "If this bugs them," operators are told, tell callers,
"'I'm sorry, but I am under strict orders not to mix up the newspaper
in politics.'" The paper will not endorse in the governor's race. Its
candidate profiles will be identical in length and placement, and
will run with same-size photos.</TE>
<TE>   In his most recent critique, Sunday, the paper's outside monitor
took mild issue on a few points. But overall, "the paper's ... news
coverage on the race ... has been free of content or agenda-setting
bias," said ombudsman Lee Warnick, head of the communication
department at nearby Brigham Young University-Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute, a journalism think tank, also praised the paper's efforts.
"It doesn't make it go away," he said of the discomfort of covering
the boss, "but it does give them a fighting chance to do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Which may be the best that can be said for Brady's chances against
Kempthorne. (Both men have token opposition in the May 28 primary.)</TE>
<TE>   Idaho is slowly changing. On the same day last month that a major
potato processor cut its farm order in half, 200 new high-tech jobs
landed in Twin Falls. It was also announced that the Eastern Idaho
Cinco de Mayo Festival had outgrown its home and was being moved to
the state fairgrounds in Blackfoot.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Idaho remains mostly rural, agricultural and white. With
1.3 million residents, the state has fewer people than the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho is also staunchly Republican. President Bush won 67% of the
2000 vote, and the GOP holds all but two statewide offices and 93 of
105 legislative seats. Brady has made Republican dominance a major
issue, assailing Boise's "power elite" as arrogant and unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   Brady has also distanced himself from national Democrats. "I'm not
of that kind," he said at a campaign stop in Pocatello, soft-pedaling
his support for legalized abortion and certain gun controls. Brady
said, however, that he personally opposes abortion, differing with
opinion editor Trillhaase, which kept the issue off the editorial
pages.</TE>
<TE>   Kempthorne had no comment on Brady's candidacy. Stumping for a
second term, the governor boasts of cutting taxes, creating jobs and
making higher education more attainable. But Kempthorne has faced a
rough patch of late.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers accuse him of slashing the state budget to finance a tax
cut for the wealthy. The governor has also been savaged for throwing
a post-Sept. 11 barricade around the state Capitol, which critics
called a symbol of his distant style. The Legislature further rankled
voters by repealing citizen-approved term limits.</TE>
<TE>   With that climate, some think Brady has at least a shot at pulling
an upset. "Which raises the even bigger nightmare," said Trillhaase.
"What if he wins?"</TE>

<HD>Skakel Witness Denies Other Suspect Confessed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>The ex-wife of a man once suspected in the 1975 killing of Martha
Moxley testified outside the presence of the jury Friday that he
never confessed to her, contradicting claims by the defense.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came during a hearing on a request by lawyers for
Michael Skakel, who is being tried for Moxley's murder, to introduce
as evidence statements made by former Skakel family tutor Kenneth
Littleton.</LD>
<LD>   The defense contends that Littleton implicated himself in the
slaying in those statements.</LD>
<TE>   Littleton's former wife, Mary Baker, testified that she was trying
to help police when she told Littleton that he had confessed to her
during a 1984 blackout.</TE>
<TE>   She said he hadn't really confessed but that investigators hoped
her statement would prompt admissions from him.</TE>
<TE>   "Has Ken Littleton ever made any confession to you in regards to
murdering Martha Moxley?" prosecutor Jonathan Benedict asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Never," she answered.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, a 41-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel,
could face life in prison if convicted of killing Moxley. They were
15-year-old neighbors in Greenwich at the time of the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, a former state investigator in the case denied
conspiring to have Baker lie to Littleton.</TE>
<TE>   The investigator, John Solomon, said Baker told police that
Littleton had made incriminating statements and they were trying to
corroborate it.</TE>
<TE>   "My best recollection is there were statements he made telling her
he may have done it, along with many statements about descriptions of
the murder and blood and things like that," the investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   Littleton testified before the jury Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   His cross-examination was delayed until Judge John F. Kavanewsky
Jr. decides whether the purported confessions can be used as
evidence.</TE>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>It took a minute to get used to the dark. Men were rushing, trying to
grab food. Their faces looked wild. Except for weed soup, they hadn't
eaten in three days.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the vestibule of the Church of the Nativity, several
candles burned on the floor around the sanctuary, and a large one
flamed in the center. They gave the only light. The men--civilians,
accused terrorists and Palestinian police officers--reached for candy
bars, crackers, rice and lentils.</LD>
<LD>   All had been there for a month. They included 13 whom the Israelis
considered to be extremely dangerous, some of them accused of killing
Israeli civilians and producing explosives. They had fled into the
church when Israeli troops invaded the West Bank after a series of
suicide bombings.</LD>
<TE>   Although the Israeli soldiers surrounded the church, the siege was
not airtight. Supporters brought the Palestinians food. The
Palestinians slipped out to steal blankets. They made scores of calls
on their cell phones--at least one to the Israeli troops outside.</TE>
<TE>   The church sanctuary stands over a grotto revered by Christians as
the birthplace of Christ. This was my first time inside.</TE>
<TE>   I had been photographing Yasser Arafat's return to Ramallah for
The Times. I returned to my hotel in Bethlehem exhausted. On impulse,
I grabbed a camera and headed down to the church to catch up with
colleagues and see what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   When I got there, I heard that members of a nongovernmental group,
the International Solidarity Movement, planned to make a run past the
Israeli soldiers and their tanks to deliver food to the 124
Palestinians inside the church. I followed them.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers spotted Solidarity and gave chase. They caught
several laggards, but 10 members of the group reached the church. It
was at that moment that I realized they were going in.</TE>
<TE>   We ran, our hands up, to the low, wooden entrance. It is called
the Door of Humility. Some say humility is what it teaches as you
stoop to enter. Without a second thought, I ducked and found myself
inside with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you! Thank you!" the Palestinians said. Many shook hands.</TE>
<TE>   The movement members were not happy that I had joined them. I had
not brought food, only a camera, and I was there to take pictures. I
was the only media photographer to enter the church since the siege
began.</TE>
<TE>   I stood in a cross-shaped sanctuary that looked about 45 yards
long. Blankets were spread on the 4th century stone floor. The heart
of the sanctuary was empty, except for a burning torch fashioned from
candle wax. Around the torch were chairs. It was the central
gathering area.</TE>
<TE>   There were more blankets on the floors along the walls of the arms
of the cross. In the left arm, I would learn later, slept the older
men.</TE>
<TE>   In the right arm was a man who had been shot, and around him were
the leaders, including Abdallah Daud Kader, head of the Palestinian
intelligence service in Bethlehem, accused by Israel of smuggling
weapons and supplying militants with explosives; and Ibrahim Abeiyat,
the Bethlehem commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
that has taken responsibility for suicide bombings and is affiliated
with Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   A Steady Diet of Weed Soup</TE>
<TE>   The church smelled of burning candle wax and the fried leaves from
trees in the backyard. The blackened leaves had the scent of burned
popcorn. Those leaves and weed soup had been the staples until we
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   All around me was a constant rumble, sometimes nearly a roar. The
men were speaking, all at once. The sound ebbed, flowed and swirled
in the sanctuary. The language was Arabic, and I could not understand
a word. I could speak only one: "Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   As the noise dropped, I could heard birds singing outside open
windows high among the vaulted beams of the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   The men took the food and made a meal.</TE>
<TE>   They gave us blankets and showed us where to sleep: in the grotto
under the floor of the front center of the sanctuary, not 15 feet
from where Christians believe that Jesus was born. The birthplace is
marked by a star. I felt a little uncomfortable. It was a sacred
place. Nobody should be sleeping there.</TE>
<TE>   But I was safe. I was under a church with stone floors, heavy
fortified walls and thick doors with metal bars. I felt protected.</TE>
<TE>   Our meal had been thin soup, hastily prepared with rice brought by
the Solidarity members. I went to my blanket after only eight
spoonfuls. It was so cold, I hardly slept. But morning came with a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   I awoke to priests in vestments singing their liturgies, a
cappella, at a small altar in the grotto. At one point, they turned
to face the Solidarity members and me. The priests seemed to be
praying for our safety.</TE>
<TE>   During the morning, the Palestinians took us on a tour of the
church compound. It had been damaged during the siege, but it was
impossible to know exactly how each part of the damage had been done
or who had done it.</TE>
<TE>   At 2 p.m., a chubby Palestinian cook, named Abu Ibrahim, had lunch
ready, made with more of the rice and lentils brought by Solidarity.
He was a good chef, tending a pot 4 feet wide and 2 feet tall,
positioned on the raised altar floor in the main sanctuary. He
apologized for making it his kitchen, but he said this was the only
safe place to cook.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Palestinians said they had lost at least 30 pounds
since the beginning of the siege. But their chef seemed to have been
sampling his wares; he still had plenty more to lose. His colleagues
called him "big chief"--mispronouncing chef every time. They loved
his cooking. The best thing about it, they said, was that he could
make something out of nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The leaders, who speculated that they might be deported to Italy
when the siege ended, wanted to take their "big chief" along so he
could learn to cook spaghetti and teach their wives, if and when they
ever returned.</TE>
<TE>   I encountered a Palestinian member of the coastal police who had a
cell phone like mine. I began borrowing his charger. He showed me how
someone had managed to bring electricity into the church and how the
Palestinians were using it to charge the 50 cell phones they had
brought in with them. Charging your cell phone became a
preoccupation.</TE>
<TE>   Last Saturday, my third day in the church, a single shot brought
down Khalaf Najezeh, 40, a member of the Palestinian security force.
He was hit in the chest by a small-caliber bullet. Other Palestinians
carried him to the raised altar floor. One of them gave him an
injection for pain. He moaned and lay still.</TE>
<TE>   On a cell phone, one of the Palestinians called the Israelis and
told them what had happened. They arrived at the door in about half
an hour and took Najezeh to a hospital in a jeep. He died before he
got there. The Palestinians sat in a rectangle and told stories about
him, then said evening prayers.</TE>
<TE>   They prayed together twice a day, at 4:30 a.m. and at 7 p.m., both
times in the main sanctuary. They had it to themselves, because the
only Christian services were down in the grotto. When the
Palestinians prayed, they faced the right wall of the church, toward
Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians said they had promised the Christian clergy in
the church compound that they would not shoot out of the church. I
never saw a Palestinian in the church fire his weapon. Indeed, I
heard only one shot fired in nearly eight days--the one that killed
Najezeh.</TE>
<TE>   That Saturday, I called my parents in Pennsylvania. After covering
the war in Afghanistan, my father had suggested that I should
consider staying home for a while. But he wasn't angry.</TE>
<TE>   "Have they hurt you? Can you get out of there?" my mother asked.</TE>
<TE>   My father said he was assuring her that I was safer inside the
Church of the Nativity than anywhere else I could be in the West
Bank. I don't know if he believed it, but that's what he told her.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, word spread in the church that negotiations to
end the siege were almost complete. "Big chief," the chef, was
singing. Everyone went to bed happy. I wanted to be near the door to
take photographs of the end, when everyone left.</TE>
<TE>   By now I had two blankets. Someone had slipped out the back of the
church, gone to a nearby hotel, called the Casanova, and stolen 11
new blankets and pillows, still wrapped in plastic. The Palestinians
gave me one.</TE>
<TE>   I went upstairs and joined a group of men, including the seacoast
policeman who had shown me how to charge my cell phone. He seemed to
have everything. In a satchel he carried across his chest, he had
Band-Aids, paper and pens, and two phone chargers. Best of all, his
group was near the door.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians kept several guns there. I slept not far from
them.</TE>
<TE>   Preserving a Precious Commodity</TE>
<TE>   On the fourth day, a Sunday, I concentrated on conserving the
battery for my camera. I slept with it in one of my pockets to keep
it warm. After each photograph, I removed it from my camera to keep
it from draining even a little.</TE>
<TE>   Food was running low, and by Monday we were eating fried leaves
and weed soup again. The leaves tasted like pastry flakes with a hint
of lemon but no sugar. In the frying pot, they looked black and
crispy. The chef fried them in cooking oil that he got from the
priests.</TE>
<TE>   The weed soup tasted like weak spinach, but when you were hungry,
it was hot and satisfying, especially if it had a little salt in it.
When you spoon it down, you think that you're having a meal, but
you're not: It's just water and a plant that looks a bit like
seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, I was hungry again.</TE>
<TE>   I grew nauseated, I felt weak, and all sounds seemed amplified. I
worried that any food I ate would not be there for others--even the
weed soup. If I did eat, my stomach seemed to contract around
anything I put in it.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations were dragging. It was one of my bleakest days.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the mother and a sister of Abeiyat, the commander of
the Al Aqsa Martyrs, sneaked some food through a hole in a door
behind the church. Oranges, rice and tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Our chef prepared what the Palestinian men joked was an Indian
meal, because it had an orange flavor. He mixed the rice with the
tomatoes, sliced up the oranges, without peeling them, and cooked
everything into a kind of rice-orange-tomato stew. The men loved it,
but they did not eat the orange peels.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations sputtered through Wednesday, my seventh day inside
the church.</TE>
<TE>   Word was the talks were going well, but then they were crumbling.
Finally they were on track again. Buses lined up outside the church,
and the Israelis put food and water on a table nearby. Scores of
reporters and photographers gathered.</TE>
<TE>   But nothing happened.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, I went to an outside spigot, where someone had
managed to tap into water from outside the compound. I washed my face
and hands and hair.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Palestinians, an old man, watched.</TE>
<TE>   My clothing was disheveled.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He returned with a clean, long-sleeved cotton shirt and a pair of
women's panties.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed crazy. Where had he gotten them?</TE>
<TE>   I'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   I followed him to an empty room inside another building in the
compound. I closed the door and changed. A perfect fit.</TE>
<TE>   He reached around the door and handed me a new pair of blue
military pants.</TE>
<TE>   When I went back outside, I used my only Arabic: "Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   At midday, I ate. With rice and lentils left over from Abeiyat's
mother and sister, we had a large meal. Should the negotiations
succeed, the Palestinians wanted to be full so they would not be
tempted to dignify the Israelis by eating the food they were likely
to place, once more, on the table outside.</TE>
<TE>   After the meal, the Palestinians grew sleepy. They napped. The
sanctuary was quiet. I could not sleep. I daydreamed about a massage,
maybe a soak in the Dead Sea, perhaps a giant falafel in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   It was all I could do to fight off depression. I did not have
enough camera battery left, negotiations were stalling, the story was
not over, and I did not think I could last until the end.</TE>
<TE>   A Fatah gunman sat next to me with a Kalashnikov assault rifle
across his lap.</TE>
<TE>   We said not a word.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn on Friday, my ninth day inside, word swept through the
sanctuary that an agreement had been reached to end the siege.</TE>
<TE>   At 5:30 a.m., the Palestinians ate another large meal of rice and
beans, the last of the food.</TE>
<TE>   A little after 6 a.m., the end came.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the 13 Palestinians whom Israel was sending into exile
lined up just inside the Door of Humility.</TE>
<TE>   The other men walked by and said farewell.</TE>
<TE>   I had only a little power left in my camera battery. I took
pictures of each as he walked through the door.</TE>
<TE>   They carried Jihad Jaara, who had been shot in his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   I took his photograph, and the battery died.</TE>
<TE>   After all of the Palestinians had left, I thought about staying
inside the church. If I waited, there was a chance that the Israelis
might pull out, and I could walk out without being arrested. When it
became clear that this was not going to happen, I decided to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The Solidarity group remained inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis took me to a bus, where I waited for hours while they
took the Solidarity members out of the church. They brought us to a
small prison, where the American consul arrived and spoke on my
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis released me.</TE>

<HD>Bethlehem Reemerges With Joy and Lament</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Residents exult over the end of church siege,
bemoan the damage it wrought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>This city rejoiced Friday as a five-week siege of the Church of the
Nativity ended, Israeli tanks retreated, and people emerged from
their homes after weeks under strict curfew.</LD>
<LD>   As they headed for Manger Square and the church's half-size Door
of Humility, however, their joy and relief were tempered by shock at
seeing how the sacred Christian site had served for weeks as a sort
of weapon-strewn boarding house.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe this," said Sandi Shakin in tears, as the
18-year-old worshiper surveyed the cigarette butts, spent shell
casings and dirty dishes littering the church. "This is the house of
God and the place where Jesus was born. What a dark moment."</LD>
<TE>   While parts of the 4th century religious compound that forms the
center of this community reeked of urine, old shoes and human sweat,
structural damage was relatively modest.</TE>
<TE>   "Given all the explosives around and all the firing, thank God it
only happened to this extent," said Archbishop Anistacios of the
Greek Orthodox Church. "There are negatives, but we have to overcome
it."</TE>
<TE>   A statue of the Virgin Mary in a courtyard abutting St.
Catherine's Chapel was hit in the neck and arm by gunfire. Several
windows were broken. Mosaics high on the left side of the church
appeared damaged. And part of an outer building suffered extensive
fire and smoke damage, following a firefight and grenade blast early
in the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem became the object of global attention in early April
after more than 200 Palestinians, including heavily armed militia
members, took refuge in the church to avoid advancing Israeli
soldiers. The Israelis invaded Bethlehem and other West Bank cities
in response to a Passover holiday suicide bombing that killed 28
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday a deal was reached under which 13 of those considered
most dangerous by Israel were exiled to Europe, with another 26 bused
to the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the 13 are at the three-star Flamingo Hotel on the shore
of Larnaca, Cyprus, under armed guard. The 13th is hospitalized with
a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis say the militants sent abroad had committed a number
of serious crimes, including the killing in June of Israeli military
officer Yehuda Edri; the killings in September and January,
respectively, of Israeli citizen Sarit Amrani and Avi Boaz, an
American; training suicide bombers; selling arms; and producing
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials Friday collected weapons the Palestinians left in
the church as part of the agreement. Israeli soldiers then searched
the church for explosives and said they unearthed 35 homemade
grenades, five guns, 40 magazines and eight bulletproof vests.</TE>
<TE>   A last hiccup in resolving the crisis took place Friday morning
when 10 members of an international group of pro-Palestinian
activists refused to leave the compound. After a short delay, they
were escorted out by Israeli police in riot gear to face deportation.
"We are leaving against our will," one activist told reporters before
being dragged off.</TE>
<TE>   As the Israeli military pulled out, Bethlehem residents reclaimed
the square and church, which have been locked behind barricades,
barbed wire and menacing checkpoints. An almost carnival atmosphere
followed as the Israeli armored personnel vehicles were replaced by
Palestinian taxis, ice cream trucks and sauntering pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   In the church's main sanctuary, near-chaos ensued after residents
were allowed in. Worshipers lighted candles and bemoaned the filth,
as children raced underfoot, monks studied the damage, and curiosity
seekers kicked and prodded the bedrolls, food scraps, pills and dirty
pots strewn around.</TE>
<TE>   Aisha Ali Jadallah, a 38-year-old Bethlehem housewife, stood
before the altar proudly detailing her blockade-running skills,
employed after the Israelis cut off all food, water and electricity
in an effort to force those inside to emerge. For several days
running at the beginning and end of the siege, she smuggled food into
the church by using special knocks and whispering the Arabic password
"achmed" at a less conspicuous side door or hurling food over the
compound wall at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I would do the same thing all over again," she said. "Those were
my neighbors in there."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the three Christian orders that share jurisdiction--the
Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian--said each was
responsible for cleaning its area of the church, with certain
"neutral" parts such as the roof left as is.</TE>
<TE>   The three share the sacred compound under a complex set of rules,
known as the "status quo," designed to avoid conflicts, preserve
areas of influence and set down permitted activities. The first
public services in more than a month are scheduled for Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, another drama was unfolding as 84 Palestinian
civilians who'd also been holed up in the church were released from
two buses in front of Hussein Hospital after a brief interrogation at
Israel's Gush Etzion military base. Israeli soldiers in three jeeps
looked on impassively as the men emerged, kissed the ground and
yelled, "Allahu akbar!"--God is great!--to the enthusiastic cries of
waiting relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost 30 pounds and was sick for the past 13 days," said Allah
Barakat, a 27-year-old naval policeman in a grimy sweatshirt. "But
I'm so excited to be out."</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, evidence of Israel's extended military campaign
was apparent in smashed street lights, damaged sidewalks and scarred
roads caused by tanks negotiating city streets at high speed.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Hanania, a 50-year-old taxi driver, said he was delighted
that the curfew was over, the worst of several he has experienced.
For safety's sake, his family decided to retreat to his in-laws'
house in the terraced hills outside the city after reasoning that it
would be more dangerous in town. Being cooped up for days on end
takes its toll physically, mentally and financially, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're locked in, you're not making any money and you're spending
more," he explained, seated on a couch facing a large satellite
television set. "Instead of eating three meals, you eat five, and
instead of smoking a pack a day, you smoke two. You get fat, watch TV
all day. Some days you never get out of your pajamas, compounded by
the friction of having the kids around all day."</TE>
<TE>   With shops closed and transport paralyzed, many like the Hanania
family have taken to planting vegetables in the area around the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real problem suddenly having your husband around all day,"
added his wife, Maha, 43. "So we've worked out a deal to avoid
snapping at each other. When he's in the house, I go to the field."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone finds the curfew unpleasant, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy I don't have to go to school," said Ramez, their
14-year-old son. A month at home also offers its own twisted lessons,
as he and his sister rattle off the various sounds, color and
weaponry of the tanks, armored personnel carriers and jeeps
patrolling the neighborhood. "Tanks are the noisiest," he said. "They
make the floors shake."</TE>
<TE>   By noon Friday, backhoes and dump trucks were threading through
the narrow alleys of the old city cleaning up the accumulated
garbage, smashed vehicles and rotting food piled up over the past
month in hopes that the economically crucial tourism industry can be
revived after all the terrible publicity, just one piece of the
rebuilding job ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "And we have to build relationships between peace-loving people in
both the Israeli and Palestinian societies to remove the radical
elements," said Mohammed Madani, Bethlehem's governor. "Our problems
are only starting now that the siege is over."</TE>

<HD>San Diego Losing Its Football Team Spirit</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Los Angeles may be lurking with a plan to steal away the San Diego
Chargers but San Diegans appear too exhausted--emotionally,
politically and financially--to fight to retain their once-beloved
NFL team. At least for now.</LD>
<LD>   From sports bars to City Hall, there is little serious talk of
blocking the bully from the north from trying to win away a National
Football League franchise that once wowed the town with wide-open
offenses and winning.</LD>
<LD>   Resignation runs so high that some fans are already considering
shifting allegiances to other teams.</LD>
<TE>   The city's best hope of maintaining its 42-year grip on the
Chargers could be if Los Angeles fumbles in its bid to build a new
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council approved a redevelopment project this
week that could pave the way for a stadium in downtown Los Angeles,
but the project has many hurdles to overcome, including a threatened
lawsuit by the county government.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the overtures to San Diego have begun. The team agreed this
week to move its training camp to Carson. And owner Alex Spanos has
made clear his desire to move to a bigger, newer stadium--something
taxpayers in San Diego have made clear they don't want to finance.</TE>
<TE>   Many cities would respond to such tactics with outrage and urgent
counterproposals. But San Diego has been pummeled by years of
controversy over the city's financial subsidies for both the Chargers
and baseball's Padres. Politicians are reluctant to even float the
idea of spending public money on a new stadium to keep the Chargers
happy and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Fans and politicians alike also are less than cheery about a team
that went 1-15 in 2000 and 5-11 in 2001--capped by a nine-game losing
streak at the end of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Even the normally pugnacious sports-bar crowd is subdued--with
some fans starting to consider rooting for other teams, including the
Chargers' archenemy, the Oakland Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   "Most fans feel: 'Hey, there's nothing we can do about it, if they
really want to move,'" said Rey Pineda, manager of San Diego Brewing
Co., a sports bar down the road from Qualcomm Stadium, the
35-year-old facility where the Chargers play.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy told me if the Chargers go to L.A., he's going to become
a Raiders fan," Pineda said. "For a San Diegan, that's about as
radical as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Although the city may yet rise to the challenge of keeping the
Chargers from leaving, the issue has not registered on the civic
to-do list.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some of our leaders are in denial," said San Diego
political consultant John Dadian. "They've got to realize this may
really happen. The Chargers are a civic asset, and we could lose
them."</TE>
<TE>   While billionaire Philip Anschutz and Los Angeles officials
apparently continue to maneuver for a slice of land east of Staples
Center in the South Park neighborhood, San Diego officials have been
absorbed with other things.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I don't think anybody thought this [the Chargers
potential move] could be happening," said Gina Champion, chairwoman
of a downtown business group. "Only in the last few days did people
begin to think it could become a reality."</TE>
<TE>   If secrecy was a strategy by Anschutz and allies to gain a step on
San Diego--like a receiver faking a defender before turning on the
speed--it has worked.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't have enough information about what is going on to
even have an argument or discussion about," said Mitch Mitchell, vice
president for public policy at the Greater San Diego Chamber of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Dick Murphy has led the push to keep construction on track
for the Padres' new downtown ballpark. But he prefers not to talk
about the Chargers, except to say he has his staff looking at the
issue and talking to team management.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the Chargers having a winning team," Murphy said in a
prepared statement. "If they believe moving their preseason training
camp out of San Diego will facilitate winning, we support them."</TE>
<TE>   That kind of mild talk does little to reassure hard-core fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the mayor?" asked Joe Davidson, a computer technician and
die-hard Charger fan since the glory seasons of Dan Fouts in the
early 1980s. "In other cities, if a team even hints about moving, the
mayor gets mad as hell. Here, the mayor says, 'Gee, it's their
team.'"</TE>
<TE>   (The move would reverse history: The Chargers of the fledgling
American Football League came to San Diego in 1960 from Los Angeles.)</TE>
<TE>   One doomsday scenario holds that the Chargers and the Padres may
both soon leave town, while city officials are frozen with
indecision.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego could end up with two stadiums and no teams if our city
leaders fail to develop and execute an intelligent strategy for
dealing with the Chargers and the Padres," said attorney Michael J.
Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego has seen other teams move or fold. Half a dozen
professional basketball teams have fled San Diego, including the
Clippers, who moved to Los Angeles in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Losing a team to L.A. only exacerbates the pain. This is a city
where bumper stickers read, "We Don't Give a Damn How They Do It in
Los Angeles" and where the 1990s slow-growth movement rallied to the
cry, "Stop Los Angelesization Now!"</TE>
<TE>   Powerful San Diegans may not have rallied to their team yet, but
they are not without barbs for their foe.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angelenos certainly don't support pro football," said City
Councilman Byron Wear. "They didn't support the Rams, the Express or
the Raiders. Why would anybody think that L.A. sports fans would be
any less apathetic now than they were in the past?"</TE>
<TE>   Some locals are also mocking the thought of moving preseason camp
from UC San Diego and the leafy, resort environs of La Jolla to the
more middle-class and industrialized Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Canepa, sports columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune,
wrote Friday of driving past Carson and being struck by its heat,
smog and "beautiful, massive oil refinery." Wrote Canepa: "Leaving La
Jolla for Carson during the summer is stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Under the five-year deal announced Thursday, the Chargers are
moving their six-week preseason camp starting in 2003 to a facility
being built by Anschutz on the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Chargers General Manager John Butler said the move will help the
Chargers bond as a team and focus on football, away from the
distractions of San Diego. The explanation seemed to placate at least
some San Diego fans, to the exasperation of radio sports talk-show
provocateur Lee "Hacksaw" Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton insists that the Chargers will be no less likely to go
out on the town in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they'll take away their car keys in Carson,"
Hamilton shot back at a caller who supported the camp relocation. "I
think they'll be out clubbin' on their off nights."</TE>
<TE>   The current lack of will for a Keep-the-Chargers campaign is also
rooted in the city's previous experiences with pro sports.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998--flush with baseball fever after the Padres' World Series
appearance--60% of San Diego voters approved building a downtown
ballpark for the team. But nonstop litigation by opponents has put
the project two years behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a clause in a 1995 contract to authorize $78
million worth of improvements at Qualcomm Stadium has returned to
haunt the city. In exchange for the Chargers' promise to remain in
San Diego until 2020, the city agreed to buy unsold tickets.</TE>
<TE>   That seemed like a good deal when the Chargers were winning and
drawing bumper crowds. But after the team reached the 1995 Super
Bowl, its fortunes, and attendance, plummeted. The city has forked
out $25.3 million for unsold tickets, some of which are then given to
youth groups.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the stadium expansion contract gave the Chargers an
out. The clause allows the team to shop for a new home after 2004 if
it exceeds the NFL cap on player salaries.</TE>
<TE>   "They can trigger, with very little effort, the conditions that
would allow them to leave," said county Supervisor Ron Roberts. "If
they decide to leave, I don't know how you can stop them. And the NFL
has never been able to stop a team from relocating."</TE>
<TE>   Chargers owner Spanos caused a furor two years ago when he told a
reporter that he would like a new stadium to replace aging Qualcomm,
one of the oldest in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in a small television market, the Chargers, like the
Padres, insist that they need a more lucrative stadium deal.</TE>
<TE>   With the Padres controversy and the ticket-guarantee flap in the
air, the idea of a new, publicly financed stadium has little public
support.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fear factor" among politicians about discussing the
issue, said Supervisor Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   After the training camp move was announced, a public opinion poll
by a local television station found that a plurality of San Diegans
wishes the team would remain in town. But a large majority opposes
spending public money to build a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this community is weary of stadium controversies," said
Gary Schons, sports fan and attorney-in-charge of the San Diego
branch of the state attorney general's office. "No one is going to
sweat the Chargers leaving if keeping them means going through the
agony of trying to build a new stadium."</TE>

<HD>For Historian Ambrose, It's Time for a 'Love Song'</HD>
<DH>He's been hurt by plagiarism claims. Now he's at work on a
new book as he battles his toughest foe: lung cancer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Before the sunlight leaked over the horizon to the clapboard beach
house, Stephen E. Ambrose slipped from his bed, padded to his word
processor and pecked out the day's first paragraph. Before breakfast,
another chapter was finished--not perfect, maybe, but at least he'd
gotten the words on paper.</LD>
<LD>   He's always been a quick writer. The relentless speed is a
much-hyped feature of the Ambrose mystique; the former history
professor has cranked out an astonishing 34 tomes. But pace has never
been so crucial. That Sunday morning would be his last ordinary day.
On Monday, Ambrose would ride to town for his first chemotherapy
session.</LD>
<LD>   After struggling with an on-again, off-again penchant for Marlboro
Lights, the swashbuckling historian has come down with advanced lung
cancer. Without treatment, the doctors told him earlier this month,
he'd be lucky to live six months. "I'd give anything to have a year,"
Ambrose says. "Two years would be.... "</LD>
<TE>   He doesn't finish the sentence. His wife and daughter blink and
stare resolutely ahead. The thought is there: Two years is a long
time for a bad case of lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   So Ambrose, 66, is writing like a man against the wall. He wakes
up at 4 a.m. "and I can't wait to get to the word processor." He has
shoved projects to the side, abandoned a much-awaited book on the
Pacific theater of World War II, put lectures and ribbon cuttings on
hold. He is enthralled with a new book, a manuscript more personal
than anything he's ever tried. He's already picked the title: "A Love
Song to America."</TE>
<TE>   Its genre isn't easily defined. Ambrose bristles at the notion of
memoir--"I'm not talking about my sex life." The book is part
interpretive history, part recollection, part grandfatherly musing.
There is a chapter on race in America, a chapter on George
Washington, a chapter on Ambrose's experience as "a Yankee in Dixie."</TE>
<TE>   He has two examples in mind: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D.
Eisenhower. Both men used their last days to pen eloquent memoirs.
And both men are longtime Ambrose role models.</TE>
<TE>   "After I got through the shock, the outrage, the
how-can-this-be-happening, I got to thinking: Screw it," Ambrose said
this week. "In the time I've got left I'm going to write my love
song."</TE>
<TE>   'My Brother Is Such a Fan'</TE>
<TE>   The tourists recognize the ruddy man in the flowered shirt who
paces restlessly in the shadows of warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   They sidle shyly to his side in the lobby of the D-Day Museum he
helped create, clutching copies of his books. "My brother is such a
fan," a middle-age man begins, and Ambrose accepts a pen. "Who's it
to?" he mutters absently.</TE>
<TE>   He's a new breed in the eclectic zoo of U.S. iconography and
popular culture: Stephen E. Ambrose, historian-as-celebrity. By
virtue of sheer, soaring popularity, the gravel-voiced, hard-drinking
scribe has turned himself into a brand name, built a multimedia
franchise out of military history and raked in millions for his
troubles. He is part professor, part pop star, a man who begins
sentences with "I said to [Richard B.] Myers [chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff] the other night, I said ... " and "Now, Stephen
[Spielberg], Tom [Hanks] and I ...."</TE>
<TE>   From a Mississippi beach house just up the coast from New Orleans,
he presides over a vast, family-run industry of guided tours, movie
deals and historical consultation.</TE>
<TE>   This hasn't been an easy year in the quixotic universe of Ambrose.
The grim medical news comes just as the author was picking up his old
momentum--collecting awards, swilling his nightly martinis, grunting
out condemnations of long-forgotten war atrocities. It comes just as
the talk of plagiarism was finally fading.</TE>
<TE>   This winter, the revelation that Ambrose neglected to give proper
attribution to scattered paragraphs in his books scandalized
publishing houses and university faculties. But Ambrose refused to be
cowed: He gritted his teeth, ignored the headlines and disappeared
into the Philippines to research the battles of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "The people decide," a defiant Ambrose said last month, planting
his loafers on an antique table in his suite in Washington's
Jefferson Hotel. He had come to town to lobby for money for a Lewis
and Clark commemoration. "If they decide I'm a fraud, I'm a fraud. I
don't know that I'm all that good at academics. I'm a writer."</TE>
<TE>   He was a reverent kid who played basketball with the returning
soldiers more than half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose likes to talk about growing up a doctor's son in scenic,
sleepy Whitewater, Wis.--"the kind of town Hollywood would drool
over"--in the calm years after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Those towering soldiers, who slept in boarding houses and studied
fervently at the Whitewater teachers' college courtesy of the GI
Bill, made a deep impression. Even now, although in a way he knows
better, Ambrose waves his big hands and says the men who get to test
themselves in war are profoundly fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "Every man that's ever born wants to know about combat, and it all
depends on when they are born," he says. "Those men were just lucky."</TE>
<TE>   The veterans are dying fast all around him--1,200 World War II
survivors every day. Ambrose has collected thousands of their
battlefield memories, lived vicariously through their stories,
traveled exhaustively to stomp over their old paths.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a genuine, wonderful, warm affection the veterans have for
Steve," said Gordon H. "Nick" Mueller, president of the D-Day Museum.
"More than anybody else in America, he opened these guys up to
talking about their experiences. He's unlocked thousands of stories
that would have been lost forever."</TE>
<TE>   Son a Sometimes Rock 'n' Roll Roadie</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ambrose flops onto a bench outside the offices of Stephen
Ambrose Historical Tours, taps his sandals on the concrete and
squints out over the dilapidated New Orleans side street. "First of
all, I have nothing to do with my dad ... that historian ... what he
does officially." He lights a smoke, collects his thoughts. "My dad
is the president of the company, but he's not here ever."</TE>
<TE>   Andy is a 38-year-old sometime rock 'n' roll roadie, a singer and
percussionist whose conga drums adorn the tourism office. Before he
hit on the clever marketing ploy of adopting his father's name, he
ran an unremarkable Big Easy tour company. He sold the gin joints of
the French Quarter and the plantations on the outskirts of town to a
parade of sightseers, and it paid the bills. But in a crowded tourism
market, Andy Ambrose wasn't seeing much room for growth. Until....</TE>
<TE>   "One day my Dad and I kind of looked at each other and he said,
'Think you ought to,' and about the same time I was saying, 'Would it
be all right if we....'"</TE>
<TE>   And just like that, Stephen Ambrose Historical Tours was born.
Vacationers pay thousands to roam Civil War battlefields, float up
the Missouri River or stroll Omaha Beach on "Ambrose-designed
historical adventures." A year ago, the company concocted the notion
of "A Weekend With Stephen E. Ambrose."</TE>
<TE>   About 45 eager readers ponied up $1,500 and flocked to New Orleans
for a three-day romp of cocktails at the Ritz-Carlton, a riverboat
cruise and a speech by "Dr. Ambrose himself."</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of the history guru was a rare exception. Although
Ambrose's hand molded his trademark tours, he steered clear of the
outings. "He lays it out," Andy says. "Where we're going to go, what
we're going to talk about, what we're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Ambrose kids grew up in moccasins and thrift shop jeans,
sported long hair and spent summers on the Sioux and Blackfoot
reservations in the Dakotas. Ambrose children boycotted grapes, did
their book learning in New Orleans public schools and spent two years
tromping the westward trail of Lewis and Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Their father was patriotic--but not jingoistic. Ambrose openly
adored the military but marched against the Vietnam War. With five
children to feed, he quit his teaching job at Kansas State in protest
over a campus visit from Richard Nixon during the bombings of Laos
and Cambodia. "Those are the acts that stuck with us kids," Hugh
Ambrose said.</TE>
<TE>   As adults, four of the children work as historians or perform some
auxiliary function for the lucrative machine known as Ambrose-Tubbs
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Night after night, Moira Ambrose listens to her husband read the
pages he has coaxed from the word processor. A former English major
and schoolteacher, Moira is her husband's most trusted editor.</TE>
<TE>   From the clan's Montana offices, youngest son Hugh oversees his
father's publicity, globe trots at his side and helps gather
research. Daughter Grace teaches history at Hunter College in New
York. Daughter Stephenie is the company secretary and author of a
children's version of the Lewis and Clark tale. Son-in-law John Tubbs
is the treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Barry, a trapper and fisherman in Montana. Andy calls
him a "mountain man," and even their father chuckles that he was born
150 years too late. Celeste, his wife, cooks meals for the Ambrose
Missouri River tours.</TE>
<TE>   Questions Arise Over at Least 5 Books</TE>
<TE>   It was "The Wild Blue" first. Then "Crazy Horse and Custer,"
"Citizen Soldiers" and "Nixon: Ruin and Recovery 1973-1990." By the
time critics had pored over the minute lines of Ambrose's work, at
least five of his tomes had turned up lacking quotation marks on
borrowed passages.</TE>
<TE>   As Ambrose points out, it was 10 pages out of 15,000. But it was
enough. They called him a fraud. They called him a copycat.
Professors frowned and wrung their hands. Newspapers wagged their
fingers. Ambrose was skewered on Web sites, talk shows and editorial
pages.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very painful for Hugh, very hard on Moira," he said,
mashing eggs and oatmeal into a gooey breakfast in the Jefferson
Hotel restaurant. "You have desperate thoughts. Recalling all your
books. Never writing again."</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, Ambrose's popularity prevailed--and the scandal
didn't do much damage. In fact, some publishers theorize the Ambrose
scrape could boost sales in the long run by strengthening his name
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the school of thought," literary agent Jeff Herman said,
"that there's no such thing as bad publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, says a California ethics expert, the common reader has a
hard time grasping why he should be angry over misplaced footnotes.
If a vignette is true and fair, why should the reader care who gets
credit?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the most serious or vile of offenses--it's laziness, and
people aren't that excited about it," says Michael Josephson,
president of the Joseph &amp; Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics in
Marina del Rey. "The victim of plagiarism is the other author. It's
almost an internal civil issue."</TE>
<TE>   Even in his adopted hometown of New Orleans, where the local
history scribe is adored as nowhere else, Ambrose cleaves a split. On
the one hand, the public adores him. It is his fellow historians who
regard him with suspicion--even disdain.</TE>
<TE>   Though he stepped down from the University of New Orleans history
department in 1995, the city continues to draw nourishment from
Ambrose's frenetic intellectual pursuits. He deposited thousands of
veterans' oral histories into the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies, an archive born in his old office at the university. In
1999, years of begging, badgering and stumping paid off when Ambrose
opened his pet project: the D-Day Museum in the New Orleans'
warehouse district.</TE>
<TE>   When the footnote frenzy reached its peak, local luminaries rushed
to Ambrose's defense in a vehement round of unequivocal quotes and
irate letters to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. University
Chancellor Gregory O'Brien called the historian "a great treasure for
American culture." Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities President
Michael Sartisky wrote in to decry the "feeding frenzy," which he
suggested was motivated by the jealousy of "lesser lights."</TE>
<TE>   Even George S. McGovern, whose autobiography Ambrose is accused of
plagiarizing, donated an impassioned letter to the historian's Web
site to defend "this brilliant author--one of the few great men I
have been gifted to know."</TE>
<TE>   But in the faculty where he'd toiled for decades, support was wan.
In a crisp January letter to the editor, history chair Warren
Billings condemned plagiarism, distanced his department from its
retired star. "We abhor such a practice," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   To hear Ambrose tell it, he's a longtime pariah among the
lesser-known historians who populate university faculties across the
country. Even before he fell into fame and fortune, there were cold
shoulders from his colleagues, he says. It was harder for him to get
fellowships and grants; tricky to nail down slots in important
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose believes his interests were unfashionable. He's long been
an outspoken critic of teachers who favor obscure glimpses of the
past over the epic stories of looming leaders and drastic clashes. "I
always had a hard time because I did military history. They want you
to teach about gays and lesbians in the Colonial period."</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower Invites Ambrose to Edit Papers</TE>
<TE>   The Second World War first trapped Ambrose's fancy when Eisenhower
invited the unknown 27-year-old Civil War scholar to edit his papers
and pen his biography. The young historian was an odd choice, but
Ambrose had caught Ike's eye by writing a book on Henry Halleck,
Lincoln's all-but-forgotten chief of staff. The hours interviewing
the former president and poring over bundles of wartime
correspondence shifted Ambrose's interest to World War II for good.
Since then, he has interrupted the flow of WWII texts with works on
the railroad, Westward expansion, Richard Nixon and Crazy Horse--but
he always comes back.</TE>
<TE>   When his stories began to climb the bestseller lists, the chasm
between Ambrose and his colleagues gaped even wider. "Any book with
more than five readers is automatically popularized and to be
scorned," Ambrose says. "I did my graduate work like anybody else,
and I kind of had that attitude myself. The problem with my
colleagues is they never grew out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ambrose wrote the book that became the HBO miniseries ''Band of
Brothers.'' He was a historical consultant on a collection of movies,
including "Saving Private Ryan." He did most of the work over the
telephone. There was no time to waste "sitting like a bump on a log"
at film sets.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he defines himself, Ambrose doesn't pause: Storyteller.
Asked who he counts as peers, he replies, "Doris and David." Doris
Kearns Goodwin suffered her own tumble from grace this winter over
missing footnotes. As for David McCullough, he won the Pulitzer Prize
for his biography of John Adams. Both, like Ambrose, are wildly
popular purveyors of blockbuster history.</TE>
<TE>   "Homer. Every generation has a storyteller. Thucydides," Ambrose
says. "What on earth is more fascinating to people than people?"</TE>
<TE>   These days, Ambrose is keeping to himself, mostly, walking the
family Labrador along the Gulf of Mexico sands outside "Merry
Weather," the little house with the big windows that he and Moira
have called home for 20 years. The chemotherapy he's undergoing in
New Orleans is intense--and experimental.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of things he's had to pull back from," Hugh
Ambrose said. "He's got to focus on his treatment right now."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, there is work to be done. Last Sunday, Ambrose
kept an appointment to take yet another oral history from yet another
World War II veteran. Watching her husband sign autographs in the
museum lobby, Moira Ambrose smiled a little.</TE>
<TE>   "He's finally got a battle to fight," she said.</TE>

<HD>Yellowstone Grizzly May Lose Federal Protection</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Three states are preparing management plans,
but environmentalists balk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Yellowstone grizzly bear, that formidable symbol of Western
wilderness, may be ushered off the endangered species list in one of
the few areas in the Lower 48 states where grizzly bears still
survive.</LD>
<LD>   Three states have joined forces to remove the federal protections
for grizzlies living in and around Yellowstone National Park. The
Wyoming and Idaho legislatures approved bear management plans earlier
this year, and Montana is holding public hearings this month on one
of its own. The plans are required to show how states would oversee
the bears once federal protection is ended.</LD>
<LD>   Officials expect little resistance from the Bush administration,
which has strongly advocated states taking on more responsibility in
environmental matters. But the three-state grizzly management effort
could face challenges by environmental groups fearing that, without
federal safeguards, grizzly bear habitat will be whittled away by a
variety of commercial interests.</LD>
<TE>   Only one other mammal has been taken off the endangered species
list: the gray whale, in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates vary on the current number of grizzlies--from 350 to
600--now living in a 13,300-square-mile area including Yellowstone
National Park and adjacent land in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Unaffected, for now, is another population of bears in the
northern Rockies around Glacier National Park, though there is strong
local sentiment to remove those grizzlies from the endangered list as
well.</TE>
<TE>   The movement to exclude the Yellowstone grizzlies, which could
occur as early as 2005, has sparked passions among both supporters
and detractors.</TE>
<TE>   Some hail the step as proof of a wildlife success story, noting
that the grizzly population around Yellowstone has rebounded from its
low of 200 to 250 bears in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But others contend that delisting is a way to open up fragile
wilderness areas to oil and gas drilling, logging, real estate
development, new roads and motorized off-road recreation.</TE>
<TE>   The critics argue that it's already clear from state management
plans that the states won't offer enough protection to the bears'
habitat outside Yellowstone National Park. Moreover, the plans could
eventually allow limited grizzly bear hunting.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other animal, the fearsome, omnivorous grizzly
stands as a living symbol of the perils of the 19th century frontier.</TE>
<TE>   The bear once roamed a vast expanse from the California coast to
the Dakotas, Oklahoma and Texas, on land now largely given over to
agriculture and suburban expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in the Lower 48 states, the grizzly survives on only 2% of
its historic range. Instead of the open plains it once favored, the
bear is found today mostly in high, rugged terrain in national parks
and surrounding national forests.</TE>
<TE>   The bear was granted federal protection in 1975 after Yellowstone
park closed dumps that grizzlies had relied on for food. Large
numbers of the bears were killed as they wandered out of the park in
search of sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, sympathy for the plight of the bears has been
tempered in the region by the anger of ranchers and farmers who have
lost cattle and sheep to marauding grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   And as the human population has grown around Yellowstone, people
have pushed to have more access to bear habitat.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of years, a few counties on the edge of grizzly
country in Wyoming have passed resolutions "banning" the bears.</TE>
<TE>   Once it is protected under the act, wildlife is rarely removed
from the endangered species list, which has swelled to include 1,258
animals and plants nationwide. Advocates and critics of the act say
that trend is a sign that the law has failed to reverse the move
toward extinction.</TE>
<TE>   In the list's 29-year history, only 10 plants and animals have
been deemed sufficiently recovered to be removed. Most were birds,
such as the brown pelican and the American peregrine falcon. Few if
any have been as controversial as the grizzly bear, one of a handful
of mammals in the U.S capable of killing human beings.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole process is plowing new ground. The agencies have never
been there and have never done that, in terms of these large
mammals," said Chuck C. Schwartz, a bear expert at the U.S.
Geological Survey Biological Resources Division. Schwartz leads the
team of state and federal agencies responsible for long-term grizzly
research.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists fear those agencies are moving too fast,
motivated by the wrong reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about local control, it's about hunting and it's ultimately
about exploitation by industry," said Louisa Willcox, grizzly bear
project coordinator for the Sierra Club in Bozeman, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz counters, however, that the federal government is legally
obliged to seek ways to remove the grizzly and other rare creatures
from the list.</TE>
<TE>   "The process we're going through is mandated by law," he said.
"People make it into this conspiracy, but we have to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The governors of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming reaffirmed their
support for the process with an April 18 memorandum of understanding,
saying bear recovery and delisting serves the best interests of
residents as well as the grizzly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly unique for species on the verge of recovery where
you have states taking such a far-reaching approach on how species
are going to be managed, if they're taken off the list," said Chris
Tollefson, spokesman at the Washington headquarters of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, which regulates endangered species laws.</TE>
<TE>   "We're supportive of the idea of states taking an increasing role
in management, and certainly doing so when species are off the list,"
Tollefson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yellowstone bear population is large enough to merit removal
from the list, said Sterling Miller, senior wildlife biologist for
the National Wildlife Federation. But for the process to move
forward, "states have to be prepared to manage these bears in a way
that the Fish and Wildlife Service will find compatible with their
continued survival."</TE>
<TE>   Miller called the current state plans "reasonable" but said that a
major challenge will be designing a conservation strategy providing
enough land for a species that demands considerable room to graze and
roam.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sierra Club, Willcox believes that federal and state
officials have failed to look ahead at potential risks the bears will
face if the legal safety net is removed.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is being too complacent, looking at current
grizzly numbers rather than potential risks, such as dwindling food
sources, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is, why are we taking chances? It's Yellowstone
park. It's the Yellowstone bear," Willcox said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people will forgive us if we blow it."</TE>

<HD>FBI Spy Contrite, Gets Life Sentence</HD>
<DH>Espionage: Hanssen apologizes for selling damaging secrets
to Russia for two decades. A bureau official calls it the 'darkest
chapter' in the agency's history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI spy Robert Philip Hanssen, speaking publicly for the first time
about his crimes, apologized in court Friday for disgracing himself
and his family, as he was ordered to spend the rest of his life in
prison for selling the Russians reams of valuable state secrets.</LD>
<LD>   "I apologize for my behavior. I am shamed by it," a sullen Hanssen
told a packed federal courtroom in Alexandria, Va. "I have opened the
door for calumny against my totally innocent wife and children. I
have hurt so many deeply."</LD>
<LD>   Hanssen's remarks in court were brief, and he said his defense
attorney, Plato Cacheris, had suggested he make them. Though he
expressed regret to his family and friends and said he was "humbled"
by their generosity, he did not apologize specifically to the FBI or
the country.</LD>
<TE>   Moments later, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton sentenced Hanssen
to life in prison without the possibility of parole as punishment for
his 22 years of spying.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence became a foregone conclusion this week when federal
prosecutors, despite concerns that Hanssen had lied to them during
hundreds of hours of debriefing sessions, decided not to try to scrap
a plea agreement reached with Hanssen last year. The deal spared
Hanssen a possible death sentence in exchange for a life sentence and
his full cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Although the life sentence itself was anticlimactic, the scene was
nonetheless an emotional one for Hanssen's friends and enemies, many
of whom turned out to mark the end of one of the worst episodes of
espionage in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice was served. This is closure to the darkest chapter in the
history of the FBI," said Van Harp, head of the FBI's Washington
field office.</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI analyst Paul Moore, a longtime friend of Hanssen's who
used to carpool to work with him, sat in the courtroom wearing a
black tie that he said he normally reserves for funerals.</TE>
<TE>   "I dreaded this day, and I also couldn't wait for it to happen.
This is over now.... It's still hard to believe he did what he did,"
said Moore, who continues to support Hanssen and has provided his
family with Amazon.com gift certificates so he can read in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Even Hanssen's former boss, retired FBI counterintelligence
supervisor David Major, who also attended the sentencing, said
outside the courthouse that he still respects the positive
contributions Hanssen made to the FBI and that Hanssen's apology
appeared "heartfelt."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew part of him," Major said. "There's lots of Bob Hanssens.
The good Bob Hanssen was a great guy. The bad Bob Hanssen I never
knew.... He swam in two worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Others were less forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Randy Bellows, who prosecuted the case,
called Hanssen "the cruelest kind of thief," responsible for stealing
valuable national secrets and jeopardizing many U.S. lives in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   And Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Hanssen "was trained and trusted
by Americans and by our American government to sustain, support and
secure the safety of America. He used the training and abused the
trust in a way which threatened the safety and security of America.
And I'm pleased that this chapter in American history has been closed
on this day."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1979, Hanssen gave his Russian handlers more than
6,000 pages of classified material and 26 computer discs with
information on national security secrets. Sometimes he would simply
grab whatever classified report he could find on his way out of the
office. He would leave his cache at designated "dead drop" spots at a
park near his home in Vienna, Va., and prosecutors say he received
$1.4 million in cash, diamonds and gifts in exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen told debriefers in recent months that he began spying
mainly for the money because he felt strapped for cash from the
pressure of supporting six children and buying a home in the
metropolitan New York area, where he was assigned in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of complex reasons as to why he did it,"
Cacheris said after the sentencing. But whether it was the money, the
ego boost or some other motive, the defense attorney said, "none of
them are valid."</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen was arrested in February 2001 after he left a batch of
stolen secrets at a drop site. Although the FBI had missed years of
warning signs about Hanssen, information from a Russian defector
alerted U.S. officials to his spying months earlier, and
investigators then began aggressively monitoring his activities.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still assessing the damage that Hanssen's
espionage did to U.S. national security.</TE>
<TE>   But they have already determined that he prompted the Russians to
execute at least three double agents by revealing that they were
working for the United States, that he compromised national security
by selling U.S. nuclear assessments, and that he exposed gaps in U.S.
intelligence capabilities that the Russians were able to exploit.</TE>
<TE>   The case sparked months of embarrassing revelations about lax
security at the FBI, and Director Robert Mueller has now moved to
shore up counterintelligence by forcing more agents to take polygraph
tests and by improving computer security, among other measures.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen is often ranked with former CIA agent Aldrich H. Ames at
the top of the list of U.S. spies based on the damage done to
national security. Hanssen is expected to serve his time at a federal
prison in Allenwood, Pa.--where Ames is housed.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be in the same facility," Cacheris said. "I suppose
they'll run into each other in the chow line."</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen's wife, Bonnie, who will receive nearly $40,000 a year
from his FBI pension and has stood by her husband throughout the
14-month ordeal, did not attend the sentencing, and neither did any
other family members. But with no cameras allowed inside, throngs of
reporters, FBI agents, avid court watchers and others packed the
Virginia courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Among the spectators was actor Ron Silver, who appears in a
recurring role in the television series "West Wing" and is appearing
in a TV movie on the case that is expected out in the fall. William
Hurt plays Hanssen, and Silver plays a boss at the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all very businesslike," Silver said of the sentencing.
"But for me it was all very interesting ... just to see his last
moment in public like that."</TE>

<HD>These Finally Are Lakers You Remember</HD>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant was correct. The Lakers have arrived at the playoff
party. Guess they were just fashionably late.</LD>
<LD>   As the citizens of Lakerland fretted over his team's first loss of
the postseason, Bryant assured everyone that "This is where the fun
starts."</LD>
<LD>   Right on target. Just like every one of Bryant's five shots in the
fourth quarter, when the Lakers closed out a 99-89 victory in an
exciting, dramatic, contentious, well-played Game 3.</LD>
<TE>   You wanted a solid 48-minute effort from the Lakers? Got it.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive stops, execution on offense, hustle, spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, uh-huh, yeah, check.</TE>
<TE>   All it took were a few shaky outings, a defeat at home and the
prospect of falling behind in this series at the noisy, charged-up
Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   These are your Lakers. They're like your kid who stays away for
hours without calling. You're furious with them, but you're sure
happy to see them come home.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were the Lakers again. They dominated the points in the
paint category, 60-46. They outrebounded the Spurs, 48-34. They were
patient and poised.</TE>
<TE>   They were everything they hadn't been for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to make it hard for ourselves," Robert Horry said. "When
it's time to focus, we can focus and do the things that we need to do
to get a win."</TE>
<TE>   And, as an added bonus, there was entertainment value.</TE>
<TE>   I'd been going through series envy, watching Dallas and Sacramento
light up the scoreboard as they race each other up and down the court
in the other Western Conference semifinal. That matchup is so fun,
Laker assistant coach Frank Hamblen said: "I'm glad we're not playing
on the same nights, so I can watch it."</TE>
<TE>   This one was worth keeping on the TiVo. Especially the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played a turnover-free first two quarters (while the
Spurs had only four). The teams put a combined 105 points on the
board midway through, with each shooting a respectable 47%.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't as if nobody put a hand in someone's face.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio's defense made the Laker offense as laborious a
process as passing a congressional bill. Once again, they rotated
well. They sent help whenever Bryant made his forays into the lane or
Shaquille O'Neal got the ball in deep.</TE>
<TE>   But the Laker defense also tightened, beginning in the second
quarter. They were deflecting passes and closing out on shooters.</TE>
<TE>   One of their best stops came when Horry and Brian Shaw
double-teamed Duncan on the baseline and Horry stole the ball. It
came with the Lakers clinging to a one-point lead in the fourth
quarter, and it led to a Bryant field goal from the lane on the other
end.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers forced four turnovers and held the Spurs to 36%
shooting in the fourth quarter, when the Lakers shot 56%.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers were proud, they also looked beat up.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was wincing every time he came to the bench in the second
half, his re-sprained ankle overriding all the other cuts and
arthritic digits bothering him. Horry had a cut lip. Derek Fisher was
soaking his feet in a tub of ice afterward, part of the aching
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "This time of year, you have to expect that," Fisher said. "The
teams that can hold it together and not continue to completely rely
on your physical talents all the time. That's the next area for us,
to continue to build rhythm within our system and doing things
mentally. Obviously, physically we're very gifted. But we have to
play smarter upstairs, and we can have more games like we did
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they're finally getting it, that they can't just show up
and expect a 'W'.</TE>
<TE>   They're accepting their frailties, but not fearing them or using
them as an excuse. They're playing through them.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who had his knee kicked and bruised in Game 1, played
through his early shooting woes Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   He shot two for seven in the first quarter, but finished 15 for
31.</TE>
<TE>   That decent percentage was thanks to that perfect fourth quarter,
when Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said his team "did everything we could
do" to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   "He made some great shots," Popovich said.</TE>
<TE>   After his final shot, a jumper in the lane that gave the Lakers a
10-point lead with 1:10 remaining and forced the Spurs to take a
timeout, I was expecting Bryant to turn to the crowd and flex, the
way he did when he made that killer three-pointer in Game 2 here last
year.</TE>
<TE>   But he calmly went to the bench and celebrated with his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when you become too emotionally involved in the game
you can overlook little details," said Bryant, who also remembered to
grab six rebounds, hand out six assists and commit only one turnover.</TE>
<TE>   There was the feeling before the game that this would be Bryant's
time. He thrives on road games and loves stepping up when O'Neal is
hobbling.</TE>
<TE>   "I love playing on the road," Bryant said. "I really do. It
excites me. Especially here. Places like here and Sacramento. It
really gets my juices going."</TE>
<TE>   He scored 73 points in the two playoff games at the Alamodome last
year, and 84 at the two playoff games in Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   And he had 31 on this night, when the Lakers were back to their
old selves, finally worthy of their rings, finally worth watching.</TE>

<LD>Ichiro Suzuki scored four runs and stole three bases as the Seattle
Mariners ended Boston's nine-game winning streak, defeating the Red
Sox, 7-2, Friday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Mark McLemore was three for four with a home run and three runs
batted in to back Joel Pineiro (3-0), who gave up both runs and three
hits in six innings.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Rafael Soriano, called up from double-A San Antonio this
week to replace Jeff Nelson in Seattle's bullpen, finished with
two-hit relief and got the save in his major league debut.</LD>
<TE>   Suzuki went two for three with a triple and a walk, and also got
on base on an error by Boston (24-8), whose American League East lead
was cut to four games over the second-place New York Yankees.
Seattle, 14-2 on the road, improved to only 11-8 at home.</TE>
<TE>   In the opener of a three-game series between the teams with the
best records in the major leagues, Seattle took a 3-0 lead in the
first with the help of two unearned runs.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth inning, Suzuki was the spark when he walked on 13
pitches--fouling off eight--stole second and third and scored on
Sierra's infield hit. Suzuki tripled in the seventh and scored on
McLemore's single.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Tampa Bay 5--The Devil Rays' losing streak stretched
to 15, the longest in the major leagues since Baltimore went 0-21 at
the start 1988, as Melvin Mora drove in two runs for the Orioles at
St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Rodrigo Lopez (5-0) gave up three runs and four hits in six
innings, leaving with a 6-3 lead, and Jorge Julio pitched the ninth
for his seventh save in eight chances.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Minnesota 3--Derek Jeter sparked a four-run fifth
inning at Minneapolis with a two-run homer, and David Wells (5-1)
struck out a season-high six as the Yankees overcame a 3-1 deficit to
win their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Wells gave up three runs--two earned--and nine hits in 62/3
innings, improving to 16-6 with a 2.44 earned-run average against the
Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Oakland 2--Tom Wilson drove in a career-high three runs
at Oakland to spoil Mark Mulder's return to the mound as the
Athletics lost their season-high fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 2, Detroit 0--Kenny Rogers (4-1) gave up seven hits in eight
innings, and Michael Young broke up a scoreless game with an RBI
double in the eighth at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 9, Cleveland 0--A.J. Hinch hit a three-run homer to
put the Royals ahead in the fifth at Kansas City, Mo., and Dan
Reichert (1-3) won for the first time since July 16.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the watchful eye of coach Alfredo Griffin, Angel shortstop
David Eckstein and second baseman Adam Kennedy logged long hours
during spring training in pursuit of the perfect double-play pivot.</LD>
<LD>   Griffin, a middle infielder for 18 major league seasons, thought
the Angels could improve on last season's 142 double plays, which
ranked eighth in the American League.</LD>
<LD>   "We had some problems last year because Eckstein was moving from
second to short and Kennedy hadn't played his position that long,"
Griffin said. "They needed to work together more."</LD>
<TE>   The work appears to have paid off.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels entered Friday night's series opener against the
Chicago White Sox ranked fourth in the league with 40.</TE>
<TE>   They turned one in a 19-0 victory at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all we focused on, day in and day out during the spring
and we still work on it," Eckstein said. "The fact that we're playing
together for a second year and know each other better has helped.
It's coming together pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Griffin said the Angels have also improved because third baseman
Troy Glaus has learned to take something off his throws to second
when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are looking good," Griffin said, "but they still have some
things to improve on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten fielded ground balls and took light
batting practice with his teammates for the first time since injuring
ligaments in his right thumb during spring training. Wooten received
medical clearance after he was examined by Dr. Norman Zemel.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor said to go by the pain," Wooten said. "I haven't
experienced any pain so far to get to this point so I think I'll be
all right. Everything feels good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pink chairs autographed by Angel and White Sox players will be in

Baseball Mother's Day initiative in support of breast cancer

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Jr. won't be back in the Cincinnati Reds' lineup for at
least another week.</LD>
<LD>   The center fielder still can't make sharp cuts on the right knee
he injured while trying to change directions during a rundown on
April 7. Griffey tore the patella tendon and went on the disabled
list.</LD>
<LD>   He'll stay in Cincinnati for rehabilitation when the team heads to
Milwaukee for a four-game series starting Monday. If his workouts go
well, Griffey could join the Reds in St. Louis for a series next
weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "If he looks good, there's a potential that he might go to St.
Louis," Dr. Timothy Kremchek said Friday. "If he does, all the
thoughts are that he could potentially play. Is that set in stone?
No. It depends on how he does this weekend and early next week."</TE>
<TE>   Griffey worked out at Cinergy Field on the team's off-day
Thursday, and had no major problems in his toughest test so far. He
jogged sideways, backward and forward, and tested the knee by jumping
and hopping.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem jogging," Griffey said. "They don't want
me stopping until I get to a certain point on my testing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins put third baseman Corey Koskie on the 15-day
disabled list because of a right hamstring injury.</TE>
<TE>   Koskie pulled his hamstring while running the bases Tuesday night.
He had never been on the DL before. The Twins recalled infielder
Casey Blake from triple-A Edmonton to take Koskie's spot on the
roster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kris Benson, who hasn't pitched for the Pittsburgh Pirates since
September 2000 because of reconstructive elbow surgery, will start
Monday against the Arizona Diamondbacks at PNC Park.... The Colorado
Rockies put right-hander Shawn Chacon on the 15-day disabled list
because of a strained muscle in his chest and recalled infielder
Brent Butler from triple-A Colorado Springs.... The Toronto Blue Jays
put second baseman Homer Bush on waivers. He will become a free agent
Tuesday if he is not claimed.</TE>

<HD>Mavericks' Support Has a Familiar Ring to It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Dallas Maverick fans boast that they'll be at the playoffs with
bells on, they mean it literally. The ringing of cowbells has become
a civic duty at American Airlines Center for the Mavericks' Western
Conference semifinal series against the Sacramento Kings, whose fans
make some noise too.</LD>
<LD>   At Grand Prairie Feed &amp; Garden, customers weren't content with the
biggest bell, which measured about 7 inches in height.</LD>
<LD>   "They want 10 or 11 inch. They want to make some noise, I guess,"
store manager Justin McAbee told Roy Appleton of the Dallas Morning
News. "These I've got will still make a lot of stinking noise."</LD>
<TE>   Said Cindy Benje, assistant manager of Texas Tack &amp; Feed in
Lancaster: "Wherever the racket comes from, the Californians are
going to get what they need. Cowboys, Mavericks, you don't mess with
any of them."</TE>
<TE>   Ringing endorsement: The inspiration for all this racket is
Maverick owner Mark Cuban.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about having fun," he wrote in an e-mail. "There are
challenges on the court, which our players work hard to conquer. Then
there are challenges to a city's pride. Sacramento fans seem to think
they are the loudest, most impactful fans in the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   When the scene shifts back to Sacramento for Game 5 Monday, it
will be the Kings' turn to take it to a new level--a new decibel
level.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: In the expansion draft to stock the Mavericks in
1980, the team passed on two veterans who would make key
contributions to this current Laker team. Can you name the veterans?</TE>
<TE>   Getting even: Bret Lewis, in a KFWB commentary directed at fans in
San Diego: "I know you're upset that we may take the Chargers. We
took the Clippers. You owe us."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the Clippers: Psychic Uri Geller has joined England's
Exeter soccer team as co-chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Geller, best known for his alleged spoon-bending powers, expects
to "motivate the fans into buying more season tickets."</TE>
<TE>   Said Geller: "I will be meeting the fans, inspiring them, telling
them how to support the club with their mind, body and spirit. I will
go into the dressing room to motivate the players."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like just the man Donald Sterling is looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Family feud: "This is better than the rest of the NBA," Gary
Shelton writes in the St. Petersburg Times of the dueling news
conferences between Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown and guard
Allen Iverson. "This is better than Karl vs. Rivers, better than Shaq
vs. Kobe, better than Duncan vs. Kidd. Throw in Susan Lucci and an
amnesia victim and we've got a hit soap opera."</TE>
<TE>   He, too, produces hits: Academy Award-winning director Ron Howard,
a guest on HBO's "On the Record" Thursday night, told Bob Costas: "I
want to be the Pete Rose of directors.... I won't go back to the Hall
of Fame again until Rose is in it."</TE>
<TE>   Wave goodbye to Cooperstown, Ron.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Coach Phil Jackson, then a New Jersey Net, and Joe
Bryant, Kobe's father, who was a San Diego Clipper.</TE>
<TE>   Finally: Describing the fans at a Montreal Expo game, New York Met
broadcaster Fran Healy said, "Crowd? This isn't a crowd. It's a focus
group."</TE>

<LD>UCLA slugger Stacey Nuveman doesn't think she owns Arizona pitcher
Jennie Finch. She'll have a hard time convincing anyone otherwise,
however.</LD>
<LD>   Nuveman hit a two-run home run in the third inning to give the
Bruins the lead and pitcher Keira Goerl made it stand in top-ranked
UCLA's 4-2 victory over the second-ranked Wildcats on Friday at
UCLA's Easton Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Goerl (27-4) struck out 12, helping give the Bruins a one-game
lead over the Wildcats (48-8, 15-4 in Pacific 10) with two games
remaining. UCLA (48-6, 16-3) needs only one win in a doubleheader
today against Arizona State to clinch the Pacific 10 title.</LD>
<TE>   It was Nuveman's third homer against Finch this year. She had two
home runs in a 6-5 victory April 7 that ended Arizona's 70-game home
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day is a new day," Nuveman said. "I respect her too much to
say that [I own her]. History has been in her favor. Hopefully, my
luck doesn't run out."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Lovieanne Jung hit the first pitch of the game for a
home run.</TE>
<TE>   But with one out in the third, the Bruins' Natasha Watley hit a
triple off the fence and Tairia Mims singled her home one out later.</TE>
<TE>   With Mims on first, Nuveman hit a 2-2 pitch from Finch inside the
left-field foul pole.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Mulholland Put on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Struggling reliever Terry Mulholland was put on the 15-day disabled
list Friday after an MRI exam revealed he had suffered a back injury.</LD>
<LD>   Mulholland, who recently began experiencing back spasms, underwent
the exam because he had been unavailable to pitch the final two games
of a three-game series against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field.</LD>
<LD>   The left-hander is expected to be sidelined for several days while
receiving treatment for the strain on his lower left side, prompting
the Dodgers to make the move, retroactive to May 4. The club recalled
left-hander Jeff Williams from triple-A Las Vegas to take
Mulholland's spot on the roster.</LD>
<TE>   Mulholland might not need 15 days to recover, but the Dodgers did
not want to risk being short-handed in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the guys pitching the innings that I want them to pitch in
game situations," Manager Jim Tracy said. "In order for me to be able
to implement that plan, we can't have a member of our bullpen on a
day-to-day type situation. It's in the best interests of Terry and
the best interests of this club that we made the move."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland has a 10.80 earned-run average without a decision. The
14-year veteran has given up 21 hits--including seven home runs--and
14 earned runs in 112/3 innings, and opponents are batting .382
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Has Mulholland been ineffective because of his back? "We were not
aware of [the injury] as this situation was unfolding and
developing," Tracy said, "because he just began with back spasms the
other day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beginning play Friday, the Dodgers led the majors with a .987
fielding percentage and had the fewest errors (17).</TE>
<TE>   Through 34 games last season, the Dodgers had 30 errors and were
13th in the National League with a .976 fielding percentage. The club
last led the NL in fielding percentage in 1960 at .979.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger players said the presence of smooth-fielding shortstop
Cesar Izturis and third baseman Adrian Beltre being at full strength
are the biggest factors in the team's improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Izturis has been about as mature a 22-year-old as I've ever
seen," first baseman Eric Karros said. "He doesn't seem to get
rattled and he's very steady. He makes all the routine plays and some
great plays, and Beltre has been solid defensively.</TE>
<TE>   "That has a lot to do with why we're No. 1 defensively. Those two
have played extremely well, they're both young and they're probably
only going to get better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green, hit by a Tom Glavine pitch Tuesday, returned to the
lineup after sitting out the final game in Atlanta on Thursday
because of swelling in his left hand. He still has some swelling in
the area and is receiving treatment. Green was one for three in
Friday's 4-3 loss to the Florida Marlins.</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS / GAME 3 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Quarter: Lakers 24, San Antonio 28</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: The crowd at the Alamodome certainly was on its
game, but what about the Lakers and Spurs? Forgetaboutit. In time,
the teams would find their respective grooves. But the beginning
featured a good deal of stout defense and not much else worth noting.
Tim Duncan showed off his MVP trophy and David Robinson was in the
starting lineup, his balky back sufficiently improved to play. You
might have expected the Spurs to get a huge lift from the fans'
energy, but it simply didn't happen.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: A Laker lead. They stayed close and ironed
out a few wrinkles as the game progressed. But their play was not as
inspired as one might have hoped in the wake of a poor start to Game
2. The Spurs failed to take advantage, however, and the Lakers were
in fine shape after 12 minutes of tentative play by each team.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: Zero turnovers for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Two fouls picked up by Laker forward Rick Fox in
three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Robert Horry 7, Samaki Walker 6;
Spurs--Tony Parker 12, Duncan 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Shaquille O'Neal 4, Derek Fisher 3;
Spurs--Duncan, Bruce Bowen 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Quarter: Lakers 53, San Antonio 52</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Kobe Bryant twirled away from Bowen, drew a foul
and sank a short jump shot. He missed the free throw, grabbed the
free ball and drove for two more points. And just like that the
Lakers had a four-point lead late in the half. Parker, playing his
best game of the series, halted the Lakers' fleeting momentum with a
three-pointer to trim their lead to 53-52 seconds before the half.
This is the way it went in the first 24 minutes. Both teams seemed
poised to break loose, but neither could get any distance.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Walker's name was not in the lineup to start
the game, but he made an immediate impact upon entering the game. By
the end of the half, he had made all five of his shots and taken
three offensive rebounds in 11 very productive minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: A one-point Laker lead is better than the 16-point
deficit they faced in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Lakers shot only nine free throws, making
seven, to 18 (with 15 made) for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 12, O'Neal and Walker 6;
Spurs--Parker 8, Duncan 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Horry and Walker 2;
Spurs--Duncan 4, Malik Rose 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third Quarter: Lakers 74, San Antonio 71</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The much-anticipated O'Neal-Duncan duel began to
heat up, with each player hoisting his team on his sturdy shoulders
for long stretches in the quarter. O'Neal took a tumble after Rose
hacked him on a breakaway dunk. O'Neal missed both free throws after
Rose was called for a well-deserved flagrant foul. But O'Neal dropped
in a hook shot and a short-range jumper over Duncan on the next two
possessions. Word to the wise, don't anger the big guy. O'Neal had 22
points by the time he went to the bench for a rest late in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The expected emotion finally showed. Bodies
hit the floor with regularity. Players pushed and shoved and the game
got a bit overheated, as it should with so much at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Through three quarters, the Lakers had 42 points
in the paint compared to 28 for the Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Fox had four fouls and two points in only 16 minutes
going into the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 12, Fisher 5; Spurs--Duncan 6,
Bowen 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Bryant 3; Spurs--Duncan 3,
Robinson 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fourth Quarter: Lakers 99, San Antonio 89</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Things were tight, but Fox ditched his
forgotten-man bit and found a leaping Bryant with a lob pass. Bryant
deftly dropped the ball into the hoop and the Lakers had an 83-80
lead. Fox took off after a Laker steal moments later, accepting a
lead pass from Fisher and dunking at the other end. Bryant made one
of two free throws, then swished an impossible jumper with Bowen all
but inside his jersey. With less than three minutes to play, the
Lakers had an 88-82 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The Lakers' gritty defense down the stretch.
Fisher clamped down on Parker. Duncan and Robinson weren't factors.
When all else goes haywire, good teams win with their defense.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers, with help from Bryant's five-for-five
shooting in the quarter, closed with an 18-9 rush.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Parker had only two points in the fourth quarter and
four in the second half after scoring 20 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 11, Fox 8; Spurs--Duncan 9, Steve
Smith 3.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Fox 5, O'Neal 3; Spurs--Robinson 4,
Duncan 2.</TE>

<HD>Fire Still a Test for Galaxy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No Major League Soccer team was hit harder by call-ups for the World
Cup than the Chicago Fire, which will make do without three starters
for the next month.</LD>
<LD>   So how did the Fire react, playing for the first time without
forward Josh Wolff and midfielders DaMarcus Beasley and Chris Armas,
who were in training camp with the U.S. national team in Cary, N.C.?</LD>
<LD>   Chicago routed D.C. United, the three-time MLS Cup champion, 3-0,
last Saturday. Not exactly a good sign for the Galaxy, which meets
the Fire today in Naperville, Ill., in the second match of a
franchise-record five-game trip.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the two deepest teams in the league are ourselves and
Chicago," said Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid, whose team will be missing
midfielder Cobi Jones for as long as the U.S. plays in the World Cup.
"You're going to miss some prominent players, but you're replacing
those guys with [the likes of] Kelly Gray and ... Gavin Glinton.
You're getting some young, talented guys on the field who are getting
valuable minutes for their development."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago has already had its fill of Galaxy rookie forward Carlos
Ruiz, who scored twice against the Fire in Los Angeles' 2-1 overtime
victory April 6 at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, including the Galaxy's 2-1 exhibition victory over CSD
Municipal of Guatemala on Wednesday, Ruiz hasn't scored in three
games. He'll try to end that streak on the unpredictable artificial
SafePlay turf of North Central College's Cardinal Stadium, the Fire's
temporary home while Soldier Field undergoes renovations.</TE>

<LD>Shigeki Maruyama made four consecutive birdies Friday on his way to a
seven-under-par 63 and a two-stroke lead in the Byron Nelson Classic
at Irving, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Maruyama pulled away from the pack with birdies on two of his last
three holes and finished at 10-under 130.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Stankowski had a 65 on the Cottonwood Valley course and was
two strokes behind at 132, along with Jim Carter (67).</LD>

<HD>Hornets on Way to New Orleans</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: NBA owners rubber-stamp approval of move
out of Charlotte as soon as the team exits the playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodbye, Billy Graham Parkway. Hello, Bourbon Street.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the NBA on Friday approved the Hornets' move from
Charlotte, N.C., to New Orleans. The vans will be loaded just as soon
as the team is eliminated from the playoffs. The Hornets, who trail
the New Jersey Nets, 2-1, in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinal series, will call the New Orleans Arena home beginning next
season.</LD>
<LD>   After 16 years of franchise stability, the Hornets are the second
NBA team to move. The Grizzlies moved from Vancouver, Canada, to
Memphis, Tenn., last year. Both teams cited declining attendance and
soaring financial losses as their reasons for pulling up stakes.</LD>
<TE>   George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge, the Hornets' co-owners, claimed
losses of $15 million last season and perhaps as much as $20 million
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to build a new arena--critical to the team's survival in
Charlotte, according to Shinn and Wooldridge--failed when a
referendum was voted down last year. The Hornets' average attendance
was 11,286, worst in the league this season, at the 19,925-seat
Charlotte Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Even Shinn and Wooldridge stopped going to games.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets applied to the league for relocation in January,
settling on New Orleans after 55 luxury suites and 8,121 season
tickets had been sold by March 15. A seven-member NBA ownership
committee approved the move 10 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans was the first home of the Jazz, which played there
from 1974-79 before moving to Salt Lake City. The Jazz played first
at the Municipal Auditorium, then in the Superdome, an indoor stadium
designed for the NFL's Saints. The Hornets will play in a new
18,000-seat arena adjacent to the Superdome.</TE>
<TE>   "As happy as I am on one hand, I am sad on the other," Shinn said
at a ceremony in New Orleans hours after the vote was announced.
"I'll only mention this one time: As you all know, I grew up in North
Carolina."</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets' ownership also will cut ties with the WNBA's
Charlotte Sting, which will stay in the city under WNBA management.</TE>
<TE>   The tally of Friday's vote of representatives from each of the
league's 29 teams was not announced, but the Associated Press
reported that it was 28-1, with only the Grizzlies going against the
Hornets' move.</TE>
<TE>   In a prepared statement, NBA Commissioner David Stern said: "The
fans, the civic leaders and the business community and the state of
Louisiana have demonstrated their overwhelming interest in having an
NBA team. Based on the level of commitment and excitement, I am
confident that the foundation has been set for a successful Hornets
franchise in New Orleans."</TE>
<TE>   In most respects, the Hornets were a model expansion franchise for
most of their 14 years in Charlotte. The community, renowned for its
support of college basketball, embraced the team in the first few
seasons. Tickets were difficult to come by and the Hornets led the
NBA in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, however, Shinn and Wooldridge battled with civic
and business leaders about financing and building a new arena with
plenty of luxury suites. The franchise also could not retain its top
players, among them favorites such as Larry Johnson and Alonzo
Mourning and was stunned by the death of guard Bobby Phills in an
auto accident two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   This season, with former UCLA guard Baron Davis leading them, the
Hornets have been a success on the court. They ousted the Orlando
Magic in the opening round of the playoffs and defeated the Nets
Thursday in Game 3 of their series before only 11,363 fans.</TE>
<TE>   Game 4 will be played Sunday at Charlotte. The team is offering
two tickets for the price of one $32 seat in an attempt to bolster a
Mother's Day crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to see it fall off the end of the earth, it's just
disheartening," Hornet Coach Paul Silas told reporters in Charlotte.
"It really leaves you empty."</TE>
<TE>   Silas was not looking forward to moving, to putting his home up
for sale, but seemed resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a kid when his parents go through a divorce," he said
of his frustration leading up to Friday's formal announcement. "It
affects him but, really, he has nothing to do with it. That's kind of
the way this was. All the questions were directed at us. Our owners
weren't saying a lot. We kind of got stuck with it. We've done what
we're supposed to do. We won games."</TE>

<HD>Wager Earner</HD>
<DH>Maine resident Jon Roberts struck it big in Kentucky Derby,
turning $20 into $203,320</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the so-called expert handicappers dismissed War Emblem as a
legitimate threat to win the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Not Jon Roberts.</LD>
<LD>   A carpenter who also helps out with a friend's electrical
business, Roberts, 32, had a life-changing experience a week ago,
thanks to his faith in trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Victor
Espinoza.</LD>
<TE>   On a $20 investment at the Winners off-track betting facility in
Brunswick, Maine, Roberts collected, before taxes, $203,320.
According to Scott Reese, the manager at Winners, it was the most a
single bettor had ever won in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "He was pretty excited," Mary Hennessy, Reese's assistant, said of
Roberts. "He's a really nice guy. When he comes in, he's pretty quiet
and keeps to himself. It's great."</TE>
<TE>   Besides betting $2 to win, place and show on both War Emblem, who
was 20-1, and 23-1 runner-up Proud Citizen, for which he got back
$117.40, Roberts had a $2 exacta and a $2 trifecta.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing the pair in the exacta, at a total cost of $4, he received
$1,300.80 and using those two plus third-place finisher Perfect Drift
in the trifecta earned Roberts $18,373.20.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his windfall, however, resulted from his nailing the
superfecta, not once, but twice. He played a $2 ticket with War
Emblem on top, Proud Citizen in the two hole, Perfect Drift third and
Medaglia d'Oro fourth. His return was $183,529.</TE>
<TE>   No more than a casual horse player for the last five or six years
and whose biggest previous score was a $1,700 superfecta, Roberts
placed his Derby bets after watching some of ESPN's extensive prerace
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much went with War Emblem because of Baffert," Roberts
said Friday, while waiting to pick up a new all-terrain vehicle he
had purchased with some of his winnings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched him for years and he wins a lot of races and, having
seen some of the races from California, I think Espinoza's a really
good rider. I liked Proud Citizen pretty much because of [trainer
Wayne] Lukas, and the other two horses were just a total shot in the
dark. I really didn't know much about any of the other horses."</TE>
<TE>   After doing some yardwork at the home of his girlfriend Janice
Dugal, Roberts sat down to watch the 128th Derby. Like the rest of
the world, he saw War Emblem, Proud Citizen and Perfect Drift run
1-2-3 for virtually the entire 11/4 miles, the first time there had
been such a parade in the race since Regret won in 1915. He wasn't
immediately certain, though, about which of the 15 other 3-year-olds
had finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Janice and I were pretty excited," he said. "I thought I had
won maybe $5,000 on the trifecta, and when I saw there was a
five-digit number next to the trifecta, I was running around the
house yelling and screaming.</TE>
<TE>   "But I didn't know about the superfecta. I really couldn't tell
who was fourth."</TE>
<TE>   He found out soon enough. While he and Dugal were driving back to
Winners to collect his winnings on the bets across the board, the
exacta and the trifecta, Roberts' friend and boss at Dwelley
Electric, Alan Dwelley, called his cell phone and gave him the good
news about Medaglia d'Oro.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty much in shock and have been for most of the week,"
said Roberts, who lives in Yarmouth, about 20 miles north of
Portland. "It was just luck. This is the first day everything has
pretty much sunk in and things are starting to feel normal again. I'm
going to pay off my bills and then I'm going to do a lot of
investing. It was just complete luck."</TE>
<TE>   Like other horse racing fans, Roberts will be watching the
Preakness a week from today. He may also get involved financially.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to stick with War Emblem and I definitely hope that
horse keeps winning and gets the Triple Crown," he said. "I don't
ever expect anything like this to happen again, but I'll probably bet
him across the board and I might try the exacta, trifecta and
superfecta."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Perfect Drift, the third-place finisher in the Kentucky Derby, won't
run in the Preakness at Pimlico a week from today, trainer Murray
Johnson said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson said the immediate goal for Perfect Drift was the Belmont
Stakes, the final leg of the Triple Crown, on June 8. Perfect Drift
has hit the board in all seven of his starts--three wins, three
seconds and the Derby third. His biggest win was in the Spiral Stakes
at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   With Perfect Drift out and Request For Parole headed for a
campaign on grass, there will be only four Derby holdovers in the
Preakness: the winner War Emblem, runner-up Proud Citizen, Medaglia
d'Oro and Harlan's Holiday. Perfect Drift's defection leaves 14
horses on the Preakness list, two of them--Crimson Hero and Straight
Gin--trained by Nick Zito.</LD>
<TE>   Trainer Wayne Lukas said he would have only one starter, Proud
Citizen, in the Preakness, a race he has won five times.</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 500 QUALIFYING</KH>
<HD>Things Definitely Speeding Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>There was a time when pole day qualifying for the Indianapolis 500
was the second-biggest day in motor racing. That was before the
NASCAR popularity boom, the IRL-CART open-wheel racing split and an
overkill of televised racing reduced attendance from around 200,000
to a fraction of that figure.</LD>
<LD>   There also was a time when an exciting--and expected--part of
qualifying was hearing announcer Tom Carnegie intoning, "And it's a
new track record."</LD>
<LD>   From 1962, when Parnelli Jones broke the 150-mph barrier, to 1996
when Arie Luyendyk pushed the four-lap record to 236.239 mph, records
were set nearly every May.</LD>
<TE>   After Luyendyk's record run, engine rules were changed in 1997
from turbocharged to non-turbocharged, dramatically reducing speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Little by little, however, time trial speeds have been creeping
up. In 1997, for instance, 218.263 earned the pole. Last year, Scott
Sharp clipped off four laps at an average speed of 226.037.</TE>
<TE>   If Friday's final day of practice is any barometer, today's pole
winner could be over the magic 230 mark.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen drivers bettered 230 under perfect conditions, with
defending champion Helio Castroneves fastest at 232.092 mph. Then
came Robbie Buhl, 231.603; rookie Tomas Scheckter, after serving a
three-day IRL suspension for unsportsmanlike conduct, at 231.600, and
Bruno Junquiera, last month's CART winner in Motegi, Japan, 231.526.</TE>
<TE>   Rain, which cut short running time four of the last six days, is
forecast for both today and Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With or without record crowds or record speeds, one thing is
certain: The 33-car field for the 86th Indianapolis 500 on May 26
will represent the strongest entry in many years, if not in the
storied history of "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing."</TE>
<TE>   There are six former 500 winners--Castroneves, Al Unser Jr., Buddy
Lazier, Eddie Cheever, Kenny Brack and Luyendyk; four IRL
champions--Sam Hornish Jr., Greg Ray, Scott Sharp and Lazier; four
CART champions--Gil de Ferran, Michael Andretti, Jimmy Vasser and
Unser; a winning Formula One driver, Johnny Herbert, and a winning
Winston Cup driver, Robby Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Plus national motocross champion Jeff Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Only three active Formula One drivers, Michael Schumacher, Jacques
Villeneuve and Eddie Irvine, have more F1 wins than Herbert's three.</TE>
<TE>   The busiest driver will be Gordon, who hopes to qualify this
weekend for the 500, jet to Charlotte to qualify next week for the
Winston Cup Coca-Cola 600, and then race in both May 26. Only Tony
Stewart and John Andretti, neither of whom is here this year, have
driven in both marathons on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   Two of CART's most successful teams, Team Rahal and Team Green,
are back at the speedway for the first time since 1995. Bobby Rahal,
the 1986 winner, has Vasser as his driver. Barry Green, who won the
1995 race with Villeneuve, has Andretti, Paul Tracy and Dario
Franchitti.</TE>
<TE>   "This field is the most competitive in years, it's kind of like
the playoffs where the best from both leagues are going head to
head," said Tracy, who drove in four 500s before the IRL-CART split
kept him on the sidelines. "It's good to be back, although with the
new control tower and all the other [Formula One track] changes, I
hardly recognize the place. But the important things haven't changed.
It's still the world's biggest race and you've still got to put four
solid laps together to get in the show and then work on running the
full 500 miles."</TE>

<LD>Those who believe Global Finance is going to win her second in a row
in today's $65,000 Nursery Stakes at Hollywood Park hope they won't
get a short price again.</LD>
<LD>   Because of a big win bet that came in just before the start of the
meet's first race on April 24, Global Finance went from 9-2 to 2-5.
As a result, those who thought they were going to get at least $11
for every $2 they bet to win were instead rewarded with $2.80.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Jerry Dutton, who owns the End Sweep filly with his
wife Barbara, Global Finance is the likely favorite in the
five-furlong Nursery, the first local stakes of 2002 for 2-year-olds.</LD>
<TE>   She and Singing Swiss, who won her debut against $40,000 maidens
on April 25, are the only two members of the field with a victory
around a turn. It was impressive the way Global Finance, who was
purchased for $32,000 as a yearling, kicked away in the final
furlong.</TE>
<TE>   Although it does not quite match the 18 who ran in the Kentucky
Derby a week ago, the $500,000 Lone Star Derby at Lone Star Park
attracted a crowded field of 14.</TE>
<TE>   Among those scheduled to go in the 11/8-mile race, which is a
Grade III stakes race, are Windward Passage--excluded from the
Kentucky Derby with the surprise entry of Danthebluegrassman--Forty
Nine Deeds, Tracemark, Smoked Em, Cappuchino and Holdthehelm.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Todd Pletcher for Gee Three Stables, Smoked Em is the
likely favorite and will be ridden by Chris McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye will be at Bay Meadows
to ride Swept Overboard in the $200,000 Bay Meadows Breeders' Cup
Sprint Handicap at six furlongs. The Grade III also attracted Mellow
Fellow, who has won five in a row, Sempai, who has a four-race win
streak, Explicit, who has won his last two, Strike For Glory and
Alyzig.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: The field in today's $200,000 Nassau County Breeders'
Cup at Belmont Park. The nine entrants have won a combined 22 of 36
races.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Don Warren. The trainer, who is scheduled to run Stoney
in today's second at Hollywood Park, has only two victories in 74
races in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Peaceful Place, Reine Des
Neiges and Nazareen in the eighth, Rapidough and Lookn East in the
ninth and Youmakemethorbaby and Destiny Calling in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 4/30. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $26.20/$163.60. Total money bet: $206.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Tells Media to Cool It</HD>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson downgraded his recent, pointed conversation with
Shaquille O'Neal from "heated" to "a give and take," though that
doesn't seem to have mollified O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   When O'Neal says Jackson "knows everything," as he did Thursday,
it usually means just the opposite, which led Jackson on Friday to
place the blame squarely where he often does: on the media.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all your fault," Jackson said with a tight smile. "It's all
you guys. You distort stuff and take it out of context."</LD>
<TE>   He laughed a little.</TE>
<TE>   "I said it was a 'heated conversation,'" he said. "It became
'criticism.' It's a give and take, is what it is."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal did not address reporters after Friday morning's
shoot-around and took treatment on his various hurting
parts--arthritic toe, stitched finger, sprained ankle--before Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   It's Jackson, probably, with whom he is unhappy. In fact, the
coach said as much.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jackson: "My question to Shaq is, physically, if you can't
get going, if it's a drain on you and it takes too much energy,
rather than rebound seven in 40 [minutes], I'd rather have a
32-minute game when you're more active. Just let me know. That's all
I want.</TE>
<TE>   "He has said, 'I'm as active as I can be.' And I said, 'Then we
should cut the minutes down.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, apparently, thought otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "He's upset I would question that particular aspect," Jackson
said. "But that's all right."</TE>
<TE>   Those around the team said that Jackson and O'Neal have been
particularly grumpy, though that could have as much to do with the
way the team has played for two weeks as one contentious
conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "Tensions? No," forward Rick Fox said. "A few words said, sure.
But, that's nothing new."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angry is one thing, Jackson said. Angry on the floor is another.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked a little bit about that to the team today, about playing
at a level where you're in control of all the faculties you have,"
Jackson said, "rather than being too amped up."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had bigger worries than Jackson, of course. Tim Duncan had
a big Game 2, and David Robinson started Friday night for the first
time since Game 1 of the Spurs' opening-round series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that's going to motivate him as much as Tim Duncan
getting an MVP on the floor," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan received his trophy before Game 3, much to the delight of
the huge crowd at the Alamodome.</TE>

<HD>Road-Court Advantage</HD>
<DH>Game 3: Bryant leads a fourth-quarter surge as Lakers get
10th consecutive road playoff victory and regain home-court edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>When it was finally over, or near enough to it that his aching feet
would carry him there, Shaquille O'Neal left the basketball court
gladly.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant looked over and smiled sweetly, and he curled his hand
into a fist, as if to say he were proud of a long, difficult effort
for the 350-pounder.</LD>
<LD>   Playing near the edge of their three-peat hopes, the Lakers
defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 99-89, Friday night at the Alamodome,
where Bryant scored 31 points and had one turnover in 48 minutes, and
O'Neal had just enough on a sprained ankle for 22 points and 15
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   After shooting 48.8%, they hold a two-games-to-one advantage in
the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals and retook a
home-court advantage lost three nights before. Game 4 is here Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of 15 lead changes in the first 40 minutes, the Lakers
outscored the Spurs, 22-11, in the final eight. In the final quarter,
Bryant scored 11 points and didn't miss in five attempts and Rick Fox
scored eight of his 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   "A big mistake a lot of teams make is going on the road hoping to
get a split," Fox said. "We wanted to come in here, play hard and
hopefully get every game here."</TE>
<TE>   In the moments before the game, Bryant worked in a new piece of
bubble gum by the Laker bench. As an arena stuffed with 35,520 people
shook with excitement--Tim Duncan had just carried his
most-valuable-player trophy from the floor, David Robinson had been
introduced as the starting center and the Spurs were gathering at
midcourt--Bryant calmly unfolded the tiny wax paper and read the
comic and the fortune.</TE>
<TE>   When he was done, he smiled and shrugged and pointed his thumbs to
the floor, as though the fortune hadn't brought good news.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about it afterward, he smiled and said, "I don't remember.
But it wasn't good for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs lost in the fourth quarter, on their home floor. They
lost when their MVP, Duncan, missed 17 of 26 field-goal attempts, and
when their former teammate, Samaki Walker, came off the bench and
threw in 12 points as the Lakers won their 10th consecutive road
playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   But, more so, the Lakers won because Bryant was the best player on
the floor. In a late 11-2 run that took the Lakers out of an 81-80
game, Bryant scored seven. Two were on an alley-oop finger roll from
Fox, two on a 17-foot turn-around, and two more when he got to the
rim again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell ya," Robinson said, "Kobe made some tough shots. ...
There was good defense on him a lot of times. He just did a great
job."</TE>
<TE>   Much of Bryant's offense was borne of necessity. O'Neal, who
suffered a mild sprain of his left ankle in Game 2, appeared to roll
the same ankle in the second quarter. His 15 rebounds should placate
Coach Phil Jackson for a couple of days, but they are sure to be days
spent treating his ankle, which was re-taped a few times during the
game, once during a second-quarter timeout.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal left without speaking to the media, a boycott of five days.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq hung in there like I've never seen him before," Derek Fisher
said. "He gave us more effort than I've seen in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   After an uneven start in which he missed a few layups, Bryant had
his best shooting game of the postseason. When O'Neal missed each of
his fourth-quarter attempts, Bryant was better still. In his last
three playoff games here, Bryant has scored 45, 28 and 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good," Bryant said. "We had to focus. There were a lot of
reports that we were going to lose because of the emotion. We had to
center ourselves and play every possession like it was our last.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more centered and focused on all the stuff around me. If
you get too emotionally wrapped up in a game, you overlook the little
details. You have to step outside the circle."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds as if Bryant was spending too much time with Jackson.
Afterward, he wore a road gray Yankee jersey with Derek Jeter's No. 2
on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there was a significance, he laughed and said, "Yeah,
he's a clutch player."</TE>
<TE>   It was a game played at the sharp end of Laker desperation, after
48 hours when some of them didn't seem to like each other very much.</TE>
<TE>   They played in all the little corners they often ignored in a
season spent figuring they had another championship coming, because
two begets three.</TE>
<TE>   The basketball that came was raw, played from the emotions of
tight jaws and thrown-back shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Between the basketball there were double fouls and technical fouls
and a flagrant foul. Robinson whacked Robert Horry, and Horry whacked
back, or vice versa. Fisher and Spur rookie Tony Parker, who scored
20 points in the first half and four in the second, glared.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wore black socks and black shoes, their ritual road
footwear of the playoffs, and did the villain thing well.</TE>
<TE>   "We rode our momentum into the fourth quarter and played good
defense," Jackson said. "We stayed with what was working. Kobe had a
great game so I didn't take him out of this game."</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Lakers take advantage of San Antonio's
unsteady play down stretch and apply the finishing touch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>There's simply no margin for error, no opportunity to pause and
admire your handiwork if you're wearing a San Antonio Spur uniform.
The Lakers won't allow it.</LD>
<LD>   For the second consecutive fourth quarter, the Spurs hesitated
ever so slightly in crunch time and the Lakers hammered them with
both fists.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs survived it once, holding off the Lakers in Game 2 of
their Western Conference semifinal series Tuesday at Staples Center.
They paid a hefty price in a 99-89 loss Friday in Game 3 at the
Alamodome.</LD>
<TE>   In the two fourth quarters, the Spurs have been outscored, 45-33.
That's no way to win a playoff series against the two-time champions.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have done things better tonight," said Danny Ferry, San
Antonio reserve forward. "Small mistakes cost us."</TE>
<TE>   No question, the Spurs matched baskets, rebounds, elbows, shoves
and floor burns with the Lakers for the better part of 40 minutes.
But by game's end, the Spurs were left to explain why they faltered
and the Lakers surged, taking a 2-1 series lead. Game 4 is Sunday
afternoon at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   Above all else, the Spurs failed to keep pace when it counted
most.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Bowen, San Antonio's defensive stopper, tailed Kobe Bryant
all around the court, but Bryant still swished shots over him, making
all five of his attempts en route to 11 points in the pivotal fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Spur center David Robinson, playing his first game of the series
after missing the first two because of a sore back, seemed to be
draped on Shaquille O'Neal's back, leaving it up to others to lead
the Lakers. And so they did.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, the Spurs went stagnant, settling for perimeter
jump shots. The Lakers ran when the opportunity was there; the Spurs
walked the ball into the frontcourt again and again.</TE>
<TE>   "They were more aggressive," Ferry said. "In the last game, we
were the more aggressive team overall. We weren't quite there
tonight. Our margin for error is not huge. We have to be solid as
heck."</TE>
<TE>   No one better epitomized the Spurs' slow fade than guard Tony
Parker, who was brilliant in the first half and out of sight and out
of mind in the second. Parker had 20 points in the first half and
looked like an All-Star. In the second, he went, "poof."</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the first [half], I was getting a lot of good looks at
the basket because I was getting a lot of pick and rolls," said
Parker, who had 24 points on nine-of-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, we changed things up to get Timmy [Duncan]
and David [Robinson] some looks. We really wanted to get something
going inside in the second."</TE>
<TE>   Didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan led the Spurs with 28 points, but made only nine of 26
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson gave the Spurs' fans an emotional charge, sending them
into a tizzy when he took the floor to start the game. But his
contributions were limited to six points, seven rebounds and the
aforementioned standout fourth-quarter defense against O'Neal in 22
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Robinson began an analysis of the Spurs' late-game
offensive woes. He said they weren't moving the way they had in the
first three quarters, standing on the perimeter instead of setting
picks and cutting toward the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get more [movement]," Robinson said. "Sometimes we
can get a little stagnant.... For us, the issue is making things
happen on the court. When you get easy baskets and get them in
transition, which we haven't gotten very many of in this series....
If you get some of that stuff, it makes the game easier. You want to
make the game easier."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs have until Sunday to get it right.</TE>

<TE>   Let's look at what he did, or didn't do, Tuesday night. When Tim
Duncan went out of the game in the first half for a couple minutes,
the great Phil did not once have his team get Shaq the ball. Phil
claims that he wants them to "figure it out" for themselves. Well, in
that case, I guess we don't need a coach then, do we, Phil?</TE>

<TE>   A robbery was committed at 1111 N. Figueroa Street in downtown Los
Angeles, California (known to most as "Staples Center") on Tuesday
night. The three culprits of the crime were seen wearing black slacks
and gray shirts with red numbers. They are known to be armed (with
whistles) and very dangerous. These culprits are ruthless and have
been rumored to feel above the law.</TE>
<TE>   Please be aware, should you locate these hooligans, do not
approach them or even speak ill of them, as their ringleader, Mr.
Stern Corleone, has been known to levy tremendous fines on those who
do. The last such incident involved a hefty $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Kobe should have made a better play, or at least a play,
at the end of the game, and the Lakers should have done something in
the first half to not allow these culprits to take advantage.
However, a crime is a crime. It is yet to be determined if those
responsible will be brought to justice or allowed to continue their
spree elsewhere in the country.</TE>

<TE>   The disgusting performance displayed by the NBA and its
officiating crew is a turnoff to any lover of sports, period. Do you
really think the Lakers committed 50% more fouls than the Spurs on
Tuesday night? Are they just that much more abusive? Did MVP Tim
Duncan really commit only two fouls the entire game, while Shaq
committed four fouls in the first half?</TE>
<TE>   In its greed-driven culture, pioneered by Mr. Stern, the league
casts aside the true essence of athletic competition in favor of
money. In order to keep viewership, and thus TV contracts, high, Mr.
Stern feels that close games are better than fair games.</TE>

<LD>The Times' thoroughbred racing-challenged writers, Mike Penner and
Bill Plaschke, don't have a clue. There has never been worse sports
coverage by anyone than their May 5 stories after the Kentucky Derby.
It's time to assign these guys to ice skating, where the judges share
their mentality, i.e., the winner should be one of the favorites, not
some longshot.</LD>
<LD>   Plaschke says War Emblem beat 17 mostly faster horses. He ran the
ninth-fastest Derby in history! Penner says the race wasn't exciting
because Baffert won again by buying the race.</LD>
<LD>   Penner and Plaschke should have to follow airline pilot rules, no
mint juleps during the eight hours preceding writing. Please don't
send them to Baltimore or New York.</LD>

<LD>Why did The Times take out the last line of Ross Newhan's story on
Gary Sheffield on May 8? I mean, after he wrote, "If it's a lot
quieter in the Dodger clubhouse, the lineup has been a lot quieter as
well" there should have followed, "But it's well worth it."</LD>

<TE>   Kaz Ishii's sixth win is the best thing for the Dodgers in 2002.
The Japanese stone lantern that is situated just north of Parking Lot
37 has been the icon of the Dodgers since 1962. This symbolic stone
lantern may be just what the Dodgers need as they celebrate their
40th anniversary at Chavez Ravine.</TE>

<TE>   Over the last few years, I slowly accepted the new Dodger
ownership, its dumb trades, management changes and have sat in the
field level. On Cinco de Mayo I joined my son's Little League team in
the right-field pavilion, my first time out there in 20 years. We all
know the hot dog lines are atrocious and we have to accept that, but
the bathrooms stink worse than any stadium in the state and the water
barely drips out of the faucets.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Stadium can't hold a candle to the Coliseum, where we can
attend USC football in the Grand Old Lady (clean and respectful) with
all her charm. Fox has blown this deal and has lost many fans who
won't be back. My heart no longer bleeds blue.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Although T.J. Simers has basically written the same article about
allowing the evil Spanos family and their football team into L.A. a
dozen or so times, it's just sinking in for me now.</LD>
<LD>   It's true we, the NFL fans in L.A., should accept only a franchise
that has won a minimum of five consecutive Super Bowls, is willing to
completely rebuild the infrastructure of L.A. County, will pay each
citizen $100 goodwill money, and give the L.A. Times sportswriters
veto power over all the franchise's moves.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks, T.J., without you, I might have settled for just any NFL
team.</LD>

<TE>   Perhaps I missed something, but unless he owns rental property in
the area, I failed to understand Mr. Johnson's outrage [Viewpoint,
May 4] over the proposed new football stadium. From what I've read
and heard, the following would occur:</TE>
<TE>   1. A few billionaires will team together to build a large, shiny
edifice in what is now an unsightly area of downtown Los Angeles--at
no cost to us.</TE>
<TE>   2. Another misguided billionaire will move his (her?) franchise to
the city.</TE>
<TE>   3. Every three years or so, the Super Bowl will come, bringing
with it tens of thousands more rich guys having large amounts of
disposable cash.</TE>
<TE>   4. My children will get to see a professional football game.</TE>
<TE>   I agree, of course, that we shouldn't pay a cent, and I'm positive
that after the success of Staples Center, that would never happen. So
lighten up, guy--we might get this free.</TE>

<TE>   In regard to Sam Farmer's article [May 4] "Coliseum, Rose Bowl
Want to Get in Game."</TE>
<TE>   The comments by Rose Bowl General Manager Darryl Dunn are
revealing about the contempt his organization holds for UCLA and
Bruin football fans. For decades, we have been complaining about the
miserable stadium and parking lot egress. The lines snaking out
through the narrow, early 20th century tunnels are almost as bad as
the chaos that drivers face at the north golf course exit gates.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Dunn has the nerve to state that "he will fight that battle to
keep UCLA if and when a new stadium is actually built."</TE>
<TE>   My family stopped going to games at the Rose Bowl because of the
stated conditions, and I sincerely hope that UCLA does not renew its
contract when a new stadium is built.</TE>

<TE>   Isn't this the same Mr. Anschutz who built Staples Center? Isn't
this the same Mr. Ridley-Thomas who failed to bring an expansion team
to the city because he insisted that the Coliseum was the only viable
site? And isn't this the same Mark Ridley-Thomas who thwarted Peter
O'Malley's attempt to build a stadium at Chavez Ravine, which
resulted in O'Malley's selling the Dodgers?</TE>
<TE>   How many times does the NFL have to tell you that the Coliseum is
not an acceptable venue? It's time to throw your support behind
someone who has proven he can make it happen.</TE>

<LD>Your articles from May 2 on the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal
Expos really highlight what a buffoon Commissioner Bud Selig is. His
Brewers still have the worst record in the league. Oh wait, they
aren't his team anymore, seeing as how he avoided a conflict of
interest by passing the team to his daughter. Such unbiased
professionalism.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins got an amazing 185,000 signatures in support of their
cause, yet I know Milwaukee couldn't raise a fraction of that. There
might be 185,000 people who will sign to get rid of them, and I am
completely convinced we could get twice that many signatures if it
would give Selig the boot.</LD>

<LD>As an 18-year-old high school senior and fan of the four major
sports, I enjoyed the article regarding age 12-17 viewers [May 7]. I
will say not as many of my friends follow sports as religiously as I
do, but I don't think you have to worry a whole lot about the
interest of today's youth having a serious effect on sports in the
near future. I can think of a couple of reasons why it's not as
intriguing these days.</LD>
<LD>   I believe it starts with playing sports. Once, Little League was
fun. Now parents think that their kid is the next $70-million
athlete, so there's added pressure given by the parents to be studs
when you're 10 or 11. You don't need that. Skateboarding and extreme
sports, we can do by ourselves for fun.</LD>
<TE>   All of the four major sports have their flaws. Baseball is slow
and when there's 162 games a year, it's not exactly a high priority
to catch game No. 38 when I have a couple of math assignments to do.
Football is not intriguing to watch when you're a Denver fan and
you're forced to watch Arizona-Atlanta. I don't think many people
would sit in front of a TV for three hours when you can get a Denver
score every 30 seconds on the Internet. The NBA regular season is a
joke. Teams don't try until the second half and the game is always
tied in the fourth quarter, regardless of the quality level of either
team. Why watch until the last two minutes? Hockey has to be seen
live. It's just not as exciting on TV.</TE>
<TE>   If you want some hope, I will say that all of my friends have
skateboarded in the past, but I can think of only two who still do
it. Kids grow up. We all realize at some point that the WWF is fake,
skateboarding gets old, and "Jackasses" lose their humor. Sports will
be OK, we just have to mature.</TE>

<HD>Celtics Low-Ball Pistons, 66-64</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A game in which both teams had trouble scoring was decided on a shot
that didn't count.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Stackhouse banked in a three-point basket a split-second
after the final buzzer, and the Boston Celtics held on to beat the
Detroit Pistons, 66-64, Friday night for a 2-1 lead in their
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series.</LD>
<LD>   With or without Stackhouse's shot--replays confirmed that the ball
left his hand too late--it was the lowest-scoring game in the NBA
playoffs since the shot clock was added in 1955. The 130 combined
points were far below the previous low of 142 registered three times,
twice in 2000. The Celtics shot 34.6%, the Pistons 34.8%.</LD>
<TE>   "It was ugly," said the Celtics' Paul Pierce, who scored six of
his 19 points in the final 1:48.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien didn't care what the game looked like.
"It's not a dance theater. If you get a 'W,' you go home with a big
grin on your face," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce made two free throws with 5.9 seconds left to give Boston a
66-62 lead. Then Kenny Anderson unwittingly fouled Chucky Atkins
while Atkins was shooting a harmless three-point shot. The Piston
guard made two free throws with 2.8 seconds left and missed the third
on purpose. Pierce bounced the rebound high off the floor, and
Stackhouse grabbed it beyond the arc and put it up. The referees
waved the shot off as the ball was in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it was like one of those ground balls that bounces
off home plate. It just bounced too high in the air, which ate up the
clock," Piston Coach Rick Carlisle said.</TE>
<TE>   It was no accident.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce said he knew he could kill the final few seconds with a
high bounce. The team has never discussed such a strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Next time, bounce it so it hits the rafters,'"
O'Brien said. "If it was about six inches lower, I would be crying
right now."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento King Coach Rick Adelman has to start thinking of ways to
shuffle his lineup without Peja Stojakovic.</LD>
<LD>   Stojakovic isn't expected to play in Game 4 today against the
Dallas Mavericks and may not play the rest of the Western Conference
semifinal series because of a badly sprained ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Stojakovic was hurt midway through the third quarter Thursday when
he stepped on teammate Vlade Divac.</LD>
<TE>   Doug Christie, who went down in the second quarter with his own
sprained right ankle, returned after Stojakovic was hurt. He is
expected to play today.</TE>

has turned into vertigo, making the Charlotte Hornets assume their

<TE>   The bloody head-to-head Game 3 collision between Charlotte's David
Wesley and New Jersey's Jason Kidd left Kidd with at least a dozen
stitches above his right eye and so much swelling he couldn't sleep.</TE>

are uncertain if Kidd will be ready for Game 4 Sunday at Charlotte.</TE>

<LD>There was no reason to think Kazuhisa Ishii would help fill that
orange bowl of empty seats at Pro Player Stadium on Friday night
considering the young and exciting local team hasn't revived or
generated any perceptible mania despite leading the National League
East and featuring ...</LD>
<LD>   * A rotation that includes four young starters--Josh Beckett, A.J.
Burnett, Ryan Dempster and Brad Penny--who light up speed guns and
fill scouts' notebooks.</LD>
<LD>   * An infield defense, anchored by Gold Glove-in-waiting Mike
Lowell at third base, that Manager Jeff Torborg calls the league's
best and maybe the best he's ever seen.</LD>
<TE>   * A versatile offense that can create runs or simply let such
hammers as Lowell, who leads the league in hitting, and Cliff Floyd,
who is among the leaders in home runs and runs batted in, drive the
table setters home.</TE>
<TE>   "If we stay healthy, stay consistent, our potential is unlimited,"
the valuable Lowell was saying about his Florida Marlins. "I mean, we
gave away four or five games early, and we've had three of our
starting pitchers on the disabled list, so to be where we are now,
there's no reason we can't play at this level or better. We're young,
we have talent at more than one or two positions, and you never know
when everything is going to click. The hope is now, of course."</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins may have more going for them than hope.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the heat of south Florida, the standings could prove to be
more than a mirage.</TE>
<TE>   In the wasteland that is Florida baseball, however, there is no
guarantee that the turnstiles will start clicking like the team has.</TE>
<TE>   There is no guarantee that Jeffrey Loria, the former Montreal and
new Marlin owner, won't ultimately prove that he is operating under
the cloud cover of contraction or relocation.</TE>
<TE>   Skepticism comes with the territory.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't then owner Wayne Huizenga dismantle his 1997 World Series
winner?</TE>
<TE>   Didn't successor John Henry commit to the future here only to
defect when the Boston Red Sox became available and he plunged a
reported $400 million into that deal when $300 million might have
produced a new stadium for the Marlins?</TE>
<TE>   What happens to Loria's commitment when Gov. Jeb Bush continues to
oppose a stadium subsidy?</TE>
<TE>   Give Loria credit on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   He understands, said stepson and club President David Samson, that
Huizenga and Henry left the area suffering from "stadium exhaustion,"
which is why they haven't immediately picked up where the previous
owners left off with their public campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, however, it has to begin. The search for revenue is
relentless.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest difference between this market and Montreal is that
even if we had found a way to fill the stadium there," Samson said,
"we would not have been in position to compete because there was no
way to build the revenue. The business and broadcast dollars didn't
exist. South Florida is the most underperforming market in the entire
country. There is nothing more exciting than taking on a project
where, when you succeed, you're in position to reap the benefits--on
and off the field in this case."</TE>
<TE>   When you succeed?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Samson insisted that success is possible, underscoring that
goal "with a promise to persevere."</TE>
<TE>   Loria bought the Marlins for $155 million after selling the Expos
to baseball for $120 million. Baseball loaned him the $35-million
difference, of which $15 million will be excused if he hangs in here
for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the shadow of contraction and Henry's eventual purchase of
the Red Sox, Loria's acquisition of the Marlins wasn't consummated
until Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins, who drew 1.2 million last year, had sold only 350
season tickets. They've now sold 4,000, a franchise low, so "we're
neither surprised nor discouraged" by the attendance, Samson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, you can't take five years of frustration and anger [among
fans] and turn it into satisfaction and loyalty in two months of
management," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins drew 23,877 for their season opener and have
subsequently drawn 11 crowds of less than 7,000. They beat the
Dodgers, 4-3, before an announced crowd of 12,953 Friday night and
now have an attendance average of 9,797. If it doesn't look like it
on most nights, isn't this the state with a questionable reputation
for accurate counts?</TE>
<TE>   It's a complex and uncertain situation in what is considered a
Dolphins' town, and the Marlins' ultimate future may hinge on what
happens to the Expos, Minnesota Twins and, perhaps, even the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays as far as contraction and relocation are concerned. It
may even hinge on the owners' attempt to restructure the economic
system.</TE>
<TE>   The players, of course, can do little more than go about their
jobs, hoping the speculation that management may trade Floyd, who is
eligible for free agency at the end of the season, to the New York
Yankees is nothing more than speculation.</TE>
<TE>   A Floyd trade, coming this far ahead of the July 31 deadline,
would certainly be viewed as a capitulation by Loria on his team,
season and future here.</TE>
<TE>   It would certainly compound the fans' already rampant skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   For now, as the Marlins, with their $41-million payroll, try to
upset the division-rival New York Mets and Atlanta Braves, there are
many nights when they look in the stands and have to wonder if the
entire market is out cruising the intracoastal waterway.</TE>
<TE>   "It stinks," said Floyd, referring to the attendance, "but if we
win the World Series with 5,000 people in the stands, so be it. We'll
have won the World Series. They can't take it away."</TE>
<TE>   Lowell agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Would we like to be playing before 35,000?" he said. "Of course.
But as players I think we've basically tuned out the crowd. As
players, if we need the crowd to determine success, we're in trouble.
We've got to come to play, whether there's 10,000 or 100,000 in the
stands, and the thing here is that it's still early. The fans were
hurt by what happened after '97 and it's going to take a while to get
their trust back."</TE>
<TE>   A 20-15 start, their best ever, might help accelerate the process.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins are doing what they need to do to create believers,
winning six games in their last at-bat and going 7-1 at home in
one-run decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "If we keep proving to the community that we're a playoff type
team, I think people will get interested again," Lowell said.</TE>
<TE>   "And selfishly, I'd much rather be playing good ball in front of
small crowds than bad ball in front of good crowds."</TE>

<LD>Jason Kapono ended weeks of indecision by announcing Friday he will
return to UCLA for his senior season of basketball. The deadline for
underclassmen to declare for the NBA draft is Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I never wanted this to be a big deal," Kapono said.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess with all the other things in my life, the weeks since the
season ended have just flown by."</LD>
<TE>   Kapono, the Bruins' leading scorer three years in a row, holds
school records for three-point baskets with 253 in his career and 87
in a season. He is No. 15 in scoring with 1,608 points and is on pace
to move up to No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Most NBA scouts projected the 6-foot-8 forward as a high
second-round pick.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully the NBA will be in my future plans," Kapono said. "For
right now, I'm at UCLA and UCLA is where I want to be."</TE>

<HD>NFL Adds Ephedrine Test</HD>
<DH>Pro football: A positive test for stimulant found in many
dietary supplements could result in four-game suspension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL will begin testing players July 1 for the banned stimulant
ephedrine, a substance used in many dietary supplements and found to
cause heart attacks and strokes.</LD>
<LD>   Implementation of the testing program was ordered after an
agreement was reached with the NFL Players Assn., which approved the
league's ban on ephedrine last September but sought further
consultation with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on testing procedures.</LD>
<LD>   A player testing positive for ephedrine, or any of several other
"high-risk" stimulants, will be subject to a four-game suspension.
Testing will be conducted year round, at random, under terms of the
league's policy on anabolic steroids and related substances.</LD>
<TE>   "We're in the process of informing the players," NFL spokesman
Greg Aiello said.</TE>
<TE>   Repeat positive tests will result in more severe disciplinary
action as determined by the commissioner, Aiello added.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL is the first professional sports league to test for
ephedrine, which acts like an amphetamine and is typically used by
players seeking to lose weight or get a quick burst of energy.</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine is also commonly used in drugs to treat asthma, colds,
allergies, fevers, and body and joint pain. NFL players taking
medications containing ephedrine will have to consult team doctors to
avoid testing positive.</TE>
<TE>   "Players will have to be mindful of what they are taking," said
Doug Allen, assistant executive director of the players' union.
"Players with those kinds of problems need to have medication
prescribed by team physicians at the appropriate levels."</TE>
<TE>   There will be postings in every locker room, informing players
that testing will begin July 1 for ephedrine, methylephedrine,
pseudoephedrine, fenfluramine, norfenfluramine and phentermine. All
are considered high-risk stimulants by the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   That memo reads in part: "As you recall, last season the NFL and
NFL Players Assn. agreed to ban the use of certain stimulants,
including ephedrine. Products containing these stimulants are often
promoted for weight loss or increased energy; however, there is
growing evidence linking these products to several life-threatening
conditions such as strokes, seizures, thermo-regulatory disorders and
heart arrhythmia."</TE>
<TE>   Ephedrine's herbal form, called ma huang or ephedra, is an
ingredient in about 200 supplements used for weight loss, building
muscle or boosting energy.</TE>
<TE>   NFL officials are concerned that some players, in an effort to
lose weight quicker, are taking larger-than-recommended doses of
ephedrine-related products.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Upshaw, executive director of the players' union, said
recently that the death of Minnesota Viking offensive lineman Korey
Stringer last summer prompted the NFL to "take a hard, hard look" at
stimulants. An autopsy revealed no trace of ephedrine in Stringer's
blood and his death was ruled heat-related, but it is widely believed
that many NFL players use supplements containing ephedrine and other
stimulants.</TE>
<TE>   Products containing ephedrine have been linked to 81 deaths from
January 1993 to February 2000, according to published reports. During
that time, nearly 1,400 adverse effects associated with the use of
ephedrine were reported to the Food and Drug Administration. These
include heart attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, increased blood pressure,
strokes and seizures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Wild West out there with regard to supplements and their
labels," Allen said. "Many times, you can't be sure what you're
taking."</TE>
<TE>   The supplement industry has gone largely unregulated since the
passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
which exempted supplements from scrutiny by reclassifying them as
foods. Attempts by the FDA to have supplements treated as drugs,
which are subject to costly testing before they can be sold on the
market, have been quashed by the powerful supplement industry with
the support of legislative lobbyists.</TE>

<HD>Ottawa Keeping Toronto in Check</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>First, Daniel Alfredsson took out Darcy Tucker. Seconds later,
Alfredsson took out the Toronto Maple Leafs.</LD>
<LD>   Alfredsson broke a tie with 2:01 left, lifting the Ottawa Senators
to a 4-2 victory Friday night. Radek Bonk added an empty-net goal
with 34.2 seconds left.</LD>
<LD>   The victory gave the Senators a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinal series.</LD>
<TE>   Game 6 is Sunday at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredsson's hit from behind knocked out Tucker and led to the
game-winning goal by the Ottawa captain. The Maple Leafs were livid
that no penalty was called.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quite frankly full of anger," Maple Leaf Coach Pat Quinn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredsson forced a turnover in the Toronto zone when he hit
Tucker, sending Tucker crashing into the boards. Tucker remained on
the ice while play continued and no penalty was called.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to finish him at all. I was just trying to make
sure the puck got to the point," Alfredsson said. "I didn't see
anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   While Tucker was down, Ottawa's Yuha Ylonen centered the puck to
Alfredsson from behind the net and Alfredsson lifted a shot over
goaltender Curtis Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   The game's officiating supervisor, Dave Newell, said of
Alfredsson's check: "Neither of [the referees] thought it was a
penalty. [Tucker] didn't get hit on the numbers, he got hit on the
shoulder and spun into the boards."</TE>
<TE>   While Quinn refused to categorize the hit, fearing another $30,000
fine he received earlier this postseason for criticizing officials,
Maple Leaf president Ken Dryden said, "It's totally unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Alyn McCauley, who had a goal and an assist, had difficulty
keeping his anger in check.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately, you'd like to go out and break somebody's leg I
think," McCauley said. "But that's not going to do any good, so we
have to go out and try to win Game 6 in Ottawa."</TE>
<TE>   After the goal was allowed, the game was delayed for five minutes
after the crowd littered the ice with cups and paper.</TE>

<HD>Capitals Fire Wilson After Missing Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Washington Capitals fired Coach Ron Wilson, who led the team to
the 1998 Stanley Cup finals but hasn't won a playoff series since.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson's dismissal Friday came a month after the Capitals, who
were thought to be a sure bet for the playoffs after trading for
Jaromir Jagr, finished ninth in the Eastern Conference--one spot from
a postseason berth--with a 36-33-11-2 record.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager George McPhee said the players started to "tune
things out" after five years under Wilson.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't believe it, that these things had to happen, but I
believe it now," McPhee said, "that at some point the players need a
new message."</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals were hurt by injuries to several key players,
including Jagr, and owner Ted Leonsis said at the end of the season
he would not make a coaching change during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Leonsis said Friday that it was McPhee's decision to fire Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised given the way we played at the end of the
season," Leonsis said, "but not surprised given it's the fifth year
and Wilson had had some problems with some of the players."</TE>
<TE>   McPhee said he was in no rush to hire a new coach. He said he had
one name in mind, but that he had not contacted that person.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a former Mighty Duck coach, was traveling with his family
Friday and did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Panthers fired interim General Manager Chuck Fletcher
and replaced him with former Tampa Bay Lightning GM Rick Dudley.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher had worked for the Panthers for nine seasons, the last
seven as assistant general manager. He became interim general manager
when the team fired coach Duane Sutter and general manager Bill
Torrey in December.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers were 22-44-10-6 for 69 points, tied for third-worst
in the Eastern Conference.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Hits High Note for Phillies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vicente Padilla showed why Philadelphia wanted him in the Curt
Schilling trade two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla came within four outs of a no-hitter against his former
team and finished with a two-hitter, leading the Philadelphia
Phillies over the Arizona Diamondbacks, 4-0, Friday night at
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "When people read Padilla's name, they said, 'Who's Padilla?'"
Phillies Manager Larry Bowa said. "Now they're starting to find out
who Padilla is."</LD>
<TE>   Padilla (5-2) was acquired by Philadelphia in the Schilling trade
in July 2000, along with Travis Lee, Omar Daal and Nelson Figueroa.</TE>
<TE>   The 24-year-old right-hander from Nicaragua retired 14 consecutive
batters before pinch-hitter Chris Donnels doubled with two out in the
eighth. Miguel Batista singled leading off the ninth, and Padilla
finished for his first complete game in eight major league
starts--all this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt happy I was throwing a no-hitter and that it was against
the team that signed me," Padilla said as Philadelphia bullpen coach
Ramon Henderson translated from Spanish. "Against Donnels, it was a
two-seamer. I was trying to keep it down and away but I left it up."</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Abreu and Doug Glanville homered to help the Phillies to
their seventh consecutive victory, their longest winning streak since
May 4-10, 1995.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the eighth, Donnels batted for pitcher Rick
Helling (3-4) and hit a liner down the left-field line that bounced
fair, then bounded over the fence in foul territory for a ground-rule
double.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was bidding to become the first pitcher to no-hit a World
Series champion since Nolan Ryan of Texas did it at Oakland on June
11, 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla struck out seven and walked three, throwing 110 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 9, New York 5--Todd Helton homered twice at New York and
Jason Jennings (3-2) held the Mets in check as the Rockies handed
them their sixth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Pierre hit a three-run double, Jose Ortiz went four for five
with two runs batted in and Todd Hollandsworth had three hits for the
Rockies, who improved to 9-4 under new Manager Clint Hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Piazza homered and drove in four runs for the Mets, who have
been outscored, 41-13, during the skid that has dropped them to third
in the NL East.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 7, San Diego 3--Andruw Jones homered twice and had five
RBIs, hitting a three-run drive off Jeremy Fikac (3-2) in the eighth
inning to lead the Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had the 13th two-homer game of his career. He hit a two-run
shot in the fourth, tying it at 2-2, and helped the Braves overcome a
3-2 deficit in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Cincinnati 2--Edgar Renteria hit a two-run homer on
the first pitch from closer Danny Graves to lift the Cardinals at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols had three hits and Eli Marrero ended an 0-for-30
slump with a single, but the Cardinals needed a homer from
light-hitting shortstop Renteria to end the Reds' three-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Houston 1--Jimmy Anderson (3-4) took a shutout into
the seventh inning at Pittsburgh, and Kevin Young hit his first homer
in nearly a month to lead the Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Young's drive came off Carlos Hernandez (3-1), who lost for the
first time in 10 career appearances as the Astros dropped their
fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Chicago 4--Tyler Houston tied it for the Brewers with
a three-run homer at Chicago, and Jeffrey Hammonds hit a two-run
shot. Richie Sexson homered for the second consecutive day for the
Brewers, who have won their first two games in Chicago after losing
nine in a row on the road.</TE>

<HD>Vazquez Takes Lead, Runs With It</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Expos finally give pitcher some early support on
their way to ending Giants' season-high seven-game winning streak,
6-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Javier Vazquez is being held to a pretty high standard.</LD>
<LD>   Vazquez pitched eight strong innings and Orlando Cabrera and
Vladimir Guerrero each had three hits to lead the Montreal Expos to a
6-3 victory over San Francisco on Friday night, ending the Giants'
season-high winning streak at seven.</LD>
<LD>   Vazquez (2-2) allowed six hits--including a leadoff homer and an
RBI single by David Bell.</LD>
<TE>   "Vazquez is better than that," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said.
"I've seen him sharper than that. He wasn't as sharp as we've seen
him before."</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Tatis hit his second homer in the second, and Montreal
scored four runs off Livan Hernandez (4-3) in the third to take a 5-2
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been getting those runs early for Javy and giving him
something to work with, and tonight we did and this is what he's
capable of doing when you get him some runs," Expo Manager Frank
Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal won its second in a row after a season-high six-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds was 0 for 3 with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to pitch [Bonds] carefully," Vasquez said, "and
today I tried to mix up all my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 2-1, Endy Chavez started Montreal's third-inning rally
with a leadoff double before scoring the tying run on Jose Vidro's
RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Vidro advanced to third on Guerrero's single and scored the
go-ahead run on an RBI single by Troy O'Leary, who made his Expo
debut after being called up from triple-A Ottawa on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos scored two of their final three runs on double-play
grounders hit by Tatis.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Offense Blasts Off</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Kennedy hits two home runs to highlight 24-hit
attack in a 19-0 victory over White Sox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began as the epitome of little ball.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Kennedy led off the third inning for the Angels with a bunt
for a base hit. David Eckstein bunted to advance Kennedy and reached
on a fielder's choice. Darin Erstad bunted for a base hit to load the
bases.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the eight-run inning was over Friday night, what began
as a bunt-fest had turned into a blowout and the Angels cruised to a
19-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox before 36,715 at Edison
Field.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe it started with three bunts, but it did,"
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels hit a season-high five home runs and had a season-high
24 hits while setting a franchise record for runs in a home game.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' output on offense continued a recent trend. They have
outscored opponents, 113-40, in their last 14 games. The 19-run
victory margin equaled that set in a 21-2 win over the Cleveland
Indians on April 30 at Jacobs Field.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was night of firsts in the power department.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy hit his first two home runs of the season,
designated-hitter Brad Fullmer hit his first home run for the Angels,
and Julio Ramirez hit his first career homer. Garret Anderson also
hit his sixth homer and drove in four runs as the Angels won for the
12th time in their last 14 games. It was the first time the Angels
hit five homers in a game since May 14, 2000 when they did it against
the Texas Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (18-16), who climbed to two games over .500 for the
first time since Sept. 17, 2001, had seven of their hits in the
pivotal third inning against White Sox starter Dan Wright (3-4). It
was the 14th time in the last 22 games that the Angels produced at
least 10 hits.</TE>
<TE>   That made it easy for left-hander Scott Schoeneweis (2-4), who
tamed a White Sox offense that entered the game leading the American
League in runs, hits, runs batted in and total bases, and ranked
second in batting average and slugging percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis, winless in his last five starts, gave up three hits,
walked two and had one strikeout in seven innings to record his first
victory since April 6. He pitched 32/3 hitless innings before
surrendering consecutive singles to Magglio Ordonez and Paul Konerko.
Ordonez was the only White Sox runner to advance as far as second
base. Matt Wise pitched the final two innings as the Angels recorded
their third shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to think of it as a 0-0 game," Schoeneweis said.
"Especially with [the White Sox] high-powered offense. If we can
score 19, they can score 19. You don't want to be the guy who spoils
a big lead like that."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, 24, pitched out of a potential jam in the second inning
but he could not escape the multi-pronged Angel assault in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy started it by dropping a bunt toward third and beating
Tony Graffanino's throw to first. Eckstein followed with a bunt to
the right of the mound that Graffanino fielded before hitting umpire
Phil Cuzzi with his throw to second base. Erstad then dragged a bunt
to the left of the mound for a single that loaded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a team that can execute little ball and do it three
times in a row, it gives your team confidence and the big boys took
over," Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Wright hit Troy Glaus with a pitch to force in the first run
before Anderson hit a fly ball to shallow center field. White Sox
center fielder Kenny Lofton lost the ball in the lights and shortstop
Royce Clayton was unable to glove it, allowing Eckstein and Erstad to
score.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer then stepped in and blasted a shot high into the
right-field seats for a three-run homer, his first home run since
Sept. 18, 2001, when he was playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Wright appeared to have regained control when he got Tim Salmon to
ground out to short and Scott Speizio to hit a fly ball to right. But
Bengie Molina singled up the middle and Kennedy chased Wright with a
home run to right, his first since last Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "The bunt set up everything," Kennedy said. "I was more
comfortable at the plate later and it gave us a nice cushion."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's two-run homer against Matt Ginter in the fourth made it
10-0. The Angels added three runs in the fifth, three more in the
sixth on Kennedy's home run off the right-field foul pole and
Ramirez's pinch-hit two-run shot to left, and three more in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who entered the game batting .189, had four hits,
including two doubles and drove in two runs. Salmon's second-inning
double gave him 526 extra-base hits, tying the Angel record held by
Brian Downing. He broke the record with a double to left in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also had four hits, and Anderson and Fullmer each had
three hits and four RBIs.</TE>

<HD>Marlins Defeat Dodgers With Flare for Dramatic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Frustrated and fuming in a strange game Friday night, the Dodgers
regained their composure long enough to rally in the ninth inning
against the Florida Marlins, get Kazuhisa Ishii off the hook for his
first major league loss and possibly finish on an upbeat note.</LD>
<LD>   Then the Marlins ruined the Dodgers' hard work with a last-at-bat
revival, completing a 4-3 victory on Luis Castillo's bases-loaded,
none-out flare down the left-field line to drive in the winning run
before 12,953 at Pro Player Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Against a drawn-in infield and outfield, Castillo blooped a single
just inside the line in shallow left on the first pitch from reliever
Giovanni Carrara (2-1). The well-placed hit enabled Eric Owens to
score easily from third after he had doubled over right fielder Shawn
Green, who froze on the line drive, to start the Marlins' rally.</LD>
<TE>   Marlin right fielder Cliff Floyd made his club's work easier,
making a lunging, backhanded catch in the gap in right-center on Dave
Roberts' one-out drive with the bases loaded in the ninth. The
Dodgers got the tying run when Hiram Bocachica tagged up and scored
but were thwarted from breaking the game open when Marlin closer
Vladimir Nunez (4-0) struck out Cesar Izturis to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Marlins got rolling against Carrara, taking the opener of
the three-game series and winning their fifth in a row to remain
alone atop the National League East.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only guy in baseball who would have caught that ball
that David Roberts hit," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said of Floyd. "You
can't hit the ball any better; you can't have a better at-bat than he
had.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball was clearly way over his head. But because of the reach
with his arms, he caught the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who worked from the stretch throughout his 61/3-inning
outing in an effort to improve his control, overcame early command
problems in a no-decision after victories in his first six major
league starts. The left-hander threw only 60 strikes in 114 pitches
and gave up seven hits and three runs (two earned).</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers lost Eric Karros when he was batting with two out and
the bases loaded in the fourth. Umpire Eric Cooper ejected him for
what Karros said was a misunderstanding. On an 0-and-1 pitch in the
dirt from Marlin starter A.J. Burnett, Cooper appealed to Mike Reilly
at first on Karros' check swing.</TE>
<TE>   When Reilly called a strike, Karros walked away from the plate
and, he said later, made a derogatory comment about the call, not
Reilly. Cooper apparently heard differently and Karros was ejected
for the first time since 1993. Dave Hansen replaced Karros and struck
out to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Cooper] believed that I used the word 'You're'" before
the comment about Reilly's call, Karros said. "I haven't used that
word in 11 years up here because I know that's an automatic ejection.
He heard 'You're.' It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd robbed Roberts in the ninth and Green's miscue in the
Marlins' half of the inning helped shut the door on the Dodgers,
completing a bad night that couldn't end soon enough for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely wasn't an ordinary loss," Roberts said. "To find
some kind of positive, it shows character that we did come back and
put up a fight, but it's a tough loss."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, whose recent move from left to right was, some believe, to
showcase him for a possible trade with the New York Yankees, kept the
Marlins in a good position despite Nunez's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander walked two, gave up a single to Marquis Grissom
and Roberts' sacrifice fly in the ninth, failing to preserve a 3-2
lead after relieving Burnett, who matched his career high with 10
strikeouts in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara entered in the ninth, his first outing since pitching five
scoreless innings and getting the win in Tuesday's 6-5, 16-inning
victory over the Atlanta Braves. Owens connected against him, sending
the ball to right and Green into confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just reading it, and it went way further than I had
judged," said Green, who has come under scrutiny recently for his
deep defensive positioning. "I froze and that was it. You have to
stop and try to read it. I don't know if I would catch that one
[today] on the same play."</TE>

<HD>Not Even Jackson Can Quibble With Gutsy Effort by O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>They leaped, he winced. They flew, he limped.</LD>
<LD>   With the weight of the coach on his mind, the weight of the Lakers
on his neck, and two bad wheels underneath him, Shaquille O'Neal
faced his most burdensome playoff game in three seasons Friday.</LD>
<LD>   While the Lakers soared to a 99-89 victory over the San Antonio
Spurs, their center struggled just to stand.</LD>
<TE>   But stand, he did.</TE>
<TE>   It was prettier than any dunk, more dramatic than any alley-oop, a
message of strength from the Laker with the least.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen rebounds on two bad feet. Twenty-two points with a bad
finger. Three assists from a guy accused of not giving enough.</TE>
<TE>   A pained, tight-lipped championship pose.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaquille hung in there tonight like I've never seen him before,"
said Derek Fisher after the Lakers took a two-games-to-one lead in
the Western Conference semifinals. "I don't think he's had this many
things going on at the same time.... He gave us more effort than I've
seen in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   And then he gave us fewer explanations, leaving the Alamodome
without talking to reporters, walking gingerly but forcefully through
a horde of cameras toward the team bus.</TE>
<TE>   We'll have to wait to find out whether Coach Phil Jackson's
pointed criticism earlier this week affected him.</TE>
<TE>   We don't yet know whether his zero points in the fourth
quarter--after scoring 10 consecutive points in the third
quarter--was due to pain or defense.</TE>
<TE>   There are still many questions surrounding the man through whom a
third consecutive Lakers' championship must pass.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday, at least long enough for his team to regain home-court
advantage in a series as bruising as expected, O'Neal did offer one
declaration.</TE>
<TE>   "When things like this happen, he responds," Rick Fox said. "He
becomes introverted very quickly, as [reporters have] found out. He
becomes upset. He feels challenged. And when he feels challenged ...
"</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake, this was a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   First there were the injuries, then, on Wednesday afternoon after
Shaq had failed to dominate in the Lakers' Game 2 loss, there was an
insult.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a heated conversation with Shaq, actually, about getting
actively involved in chasing the ball down," Jackson said after that
Wednesday practice. "Shaq is, you know, I wanted to stimulate him and
I wanted to motivate him to the fact we need him to play at a really
active level."</TE>
<TE>   A heated conversation? Superman needing stimulation?</TE>
<TE>   A day later, O'Neal responded by telling the Associated Press,
"Ask Phil. He knows everything."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday before the game, Jackson expounded upon his remarks,
saying, "It was taken out of context. A heated conversation? It was
give-and-take, that's what it was. It's just to motivate guys."</TE>
<TE>   He continued, "I think [O'Neal] was upset that I could question
that particular aspect. That's all right."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Jackson knew O'Neal was mad, and maybe that was
the point.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq needs to hear that from time to time," Brian Shaw said. "And
Phil's really the only guy bold enough to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Bold enough, and smart enough.</TE>
<TE>   The last time O'Neal was this mad at his coach, it was in
mid-November, after O'Neal's unexcused absence from practice
following the birth of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson fined him, O'Neal was furious, and guess what happened.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game after venting to reporters, O'Neal scored 30
points with 13 rebounds against Houston. The next night against
Phoenix, he scored 28 points with 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Friday, which was not without its own calamities.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, O'Neal caught a ball and fell out of bounds. He
dropped passes. He was beaten on an alley-oop over his head.</TE>
<TE>   During one timeout, he was scolded by Jackson, but did not want to
listen, waving him off twice and turning his back.</TE>
<TE>   He was seemingly so tired after one turnover in the third quarter,
he walked slowly up the court, so slowly that he was still not yet at
half court when Tim Duncan missed a jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, he was able to take a pass and score on a fastbreak while
being flagrantly fouled by Malik Rose.</TE>
<TE>   It was seemingly the inspiration he needed.</TE>
<TE>   He scored on consecutive jumpers, then, one possession later, on a
dunk, all part of those 10 consecutive points.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is not at a level that we're used to seeing," Fox said. "But
it's going to be like this the rest of the way."</TE>
<TE>   An awkward, bumpy trip that, for one day anyway, was navigated by
following the limping giant.</TE>

the final leg, giving up a chance to earn from two to 19 points.
Newport Harbor won the 200 free relay and later clinched the title
with a victory in the final event, the 400 free relay. The Sailors
scored 198 points, Mission Viejo had 196 and Mission Viejo Capistrano
Valley was third with 177.</LD>
<LD>   "It's awesome," said Newport Harbor senior Aaron Peirsol, who
anchored both relays and also won the 200 free and 100 backstroke. "A
great way to end the season."</LD>
<TE>   Anaheim Servite's Adam Hewko won the 500 free for the second
consecutive season and the 200 individual medley.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine girls' team won its sixth consecutive Division I title,
opening the meet by winning the 200-yard medley relay in 1 minute
43.71 seconds to break its month-old national high school mark of
1:44.72.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's Courtney Cashion won the 100 free in a division-record
49.45, and the 50 free. Teammate Diana MacManus won the 100
backstroke in a division-record 54.42.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine scored 285 points, Santa Margarita had 197 and Anaheim
Canyon had 190.</TE>

<LD>Tustin senior Michael Cavic broke the national high school record in
the 50 freestyle during the Southern Section Division II
preliminaries Friday at Long Beach Belmont Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic set the record of 19.77 seconds on the opening leg of the
200 freestyle relay, surpassing the time of 19.91 by Anthony Robinson
of Houston Memorial in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Cavic said he will try to become the first high school swimmer to
break 47 seconds in the 100 butterfly in today's finals.</LD>
<TE>   He was the top qualifier in prelims, posting a time of 50.60 after
swimming the first half in 23.11. The national high school record is
47.10, set by Nate Dusing in 1997.</TE>

<LD>David Robinson made it through Thursday's practice without his sore
back troubling him. He participated in Friday's morning shoot-around
pain-free. He worked up a good sweat during the pregame warmup Friday
night and went to get checked out by the Spurs' medical staff.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of hearing, "No," from the doctors, as was the case in the
past, Robinson and the Spurs heard, "Yes," and he was in the starting
lineup for Game 3 of their second-round playoff series against the
Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich acknowledged that Robinson's
fitness was very much in doubt. Robinson last played April 20, when
he exited the Spurs' playoff game after seven minutes against the
Seattle SuperSonics.</LD>
<TE>   Otherwise, Robinson looked OK to Popovich. "He's come through
practice pretty good," Popovich said. "During practice, he's looked
fine. The problems are afterward and the next day. His wind,
certainly, is poor, as you would expect after a month."</TE>
<TE>   In 22 minutes Friday, Robinson scored six points on
three-for-seven shooting and had seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Tim Duncan received his most-valuable-player award
Thursday after finishing just ahead of Jason Kidd of the New Jersey
Nets in the voting. That got Spur guard Tony Parker to thinking about
his teammate's status as perhaps the league's best player.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they talk about Shaq," Parker said, referring to
Laker center Shaquille O'Neal, who was third in the voting. "I think
Timmy, he's been there all year. He's just dominant."</TE>
<TE>   When someone pointed out that Parker's comments might find their
way onto a bulletin board in the Laker locker room, the 19-year-old
rookie didn't flinch.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to hit me hard, but that's OK. I'll get up," said
Parker, who is generously listed in the press notes at 6 feet 2 and
180 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that Parker had an eye-catching rookie season,
giving the Spurs a decidedly more energetic look.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different team because we've got nine new players, and
Tony Parker is just one of them," Popovich said. "We're more athletic
at the point [guard position] and a whole lot more confused at times
because he's 19."</TE>
<TE>   After the laughter of reporters faded, Popovich adopted a more
serious tone.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a heck of a solid season and playoffs against Seattle
and the Lakers," the coach said of Parker, who has averaged 14.6
points in the playoffs. "I couldn't ask for more out of a 19-year-old
kid."</TE>

<DH>Swimming: Volcan wins third consecutive title in 200
freestyle to help Anaheim Canyon girls' team finish third at Division
I finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Erin Volcan didn't spend much time checking out the competition
during the second half of the 200-yard freestyle Friday during the
Southern Section Division I girls' swimming finals at Long Beach
Belmont Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   The Anaheim Canyon High senior took one look around with 75 yards
to go and knew she was on the way to her third consecutive title in
the event.</LD>
<LD>   Volcan finished in a personal-best time of 1 minute 48.71 seconds,
paving the way for a memorable end to her high school career. She
also anchored Canyon's 200 freestyle relay team to a first-place
finish in 1:36.73, only .02 of a second off the division record.</LD>
<TE>   She finished second in the 100 backstroke with a personal-best
time of 54.44, only .02 of a second behind Irvine's Diana MacManus
and also under the division record of 54.69.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan capped her evening by helping the Comanches to a
second-place finish in the 400 freestyle relay (3:31.23), allowing
Canyon to take third in the team standings, the best finish in school
history.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan went out fast in the 200 free, swimming the first 100 yards
in 53.46, just ahead of Adrienne Binder of Santa Barbara San Marcos
(53.69). When Volcan made her next turn 50 yards later, she knew she
was in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of times I go out fast and die at the end," she said. "I
knew with 75 yards to go I wasn't going to die. I started telling
myself, 'I have this.'"</TE>
<TE>   The only other girl to win three 200 free titles in the top
division is Rebecca Gilman of Ventura Buena, who did it from 1994-96.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan looked strong in the preliminaries on Wednesday. She had
the top qualifying time of 1:50.29 in the 200 free, which came as
somewhat of a surprise to her as she has struggled with her form all
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my feel for the water [in the 200 freestyle this season],"
she said afterward. "I felt a little sloppy."</TE>
<TE>   Volcan hit the water full speed this season and never let up.
After finishing second in the 200-meter backstroke at the U.S. Spring
Nationals in Minneapolis, she anchored three Canyon relay teams to
meet records at the Southern Section Relays last month.</TE>
<TE>   She followed sisters Lauren and Courtney Mathewsons and Sheva
Khalafbeigi with a 56.0 free split to win the 400 medley relay in
4:00.10, breaking a 19-year meet record by .06.</TE>
<TE>   Lara Pease and Michelle Anderson joined the foursome to set a meet
record of 2:29.82 in the 300 free relay, then Volcan teamed with
Pease and the Mathewsons to set a record of 1:46.61 in the 200
backstroke relay.</TE>
<TE>   There was never any doubt Volcan had a bright future at Canyon. In
her first week as a freshman, she broke the school record in the 200
free (1:55.3). That summer, she won the junior national championships
in the 200-meter free.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan has dual citizenship in Venezuela because her father,
Jorge, was born there and moved with his family to the United States
as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   She was a member of the Venezuelan National Team from 1997-2001,
won the 200-meter backstroke at the South American Championships in
Argentina in 2000 and is the country's national record-holder in the
event.</TE>
<TE>   Volcan began competing at the Central American Games in 1998 with
the hopes of becoming the first woman to represent Venezula in
swimming in the Olympics at the Sydney Games, but she came up nearly
four seconds short of the qualifying standard in the backstroke.</TE>
<TE>   In November, she signed with Auburn, whose coaches, she said, plan
to develop her versatility by having her train with the backstrokers,
middle freestylers and individual medalists.</TE>

<LD>L.A. riots: An April 29 story incorrectly referred to the April
1992 Los Angeles riots as the 'deadliest in the 20th century.' In 1921, a
riot by a predominantly white mob in Tulsa resulted in the deaths of an
estimated 300 black residents.</LD>

<LD>Federal succession-A story in the A section Friday on the expanded
succession plans at federal agencies misstated that process. A full tier
of senior managers in each agency must be exhausted before the newly
added officials would take over. At the Treasury Department, for
instance, the secretary and deputy secretary would be succeeded by three
deputy undersecretaries (in the order of their swearing-in), the general
counsel and the 10 assistant secretaries. The newly added successors
would follow this group.</LD>
