<LD>"We have better security tonight than they had at the Oscars," said
Aaron Cohen, before giving commands in Hebrew into his radio fastened
on the lapel of his black suit. His eyes darted among the guests, and
he barked another command into his lapel as a car alarm went off
nearby.</LD>
<LD>   "This is Israeli-style security," said 26-year-old Cohen, who was
in charge of the 30 armed guards stationed at the Century Club on
Wednesday night. The evening's event: a party to celebrate Israel's
54th year of independence.</LD>
<LD>   When a crowd in skintight club-wear and black leather jackets
arrived at the club, Cohen's guards searched their cars and checked
IDs. In front of the club, two red carpets led up to metal detectors,
where bags were searched and IDs checked again.</LD>
<TE>   A group of women in sparkly dresses lined up behind the black
velvet rope at the club's entrance. "Keep to the right," a security
guard yelled, "we need to have this space cleared." Nobody objected
as purses were searched again, and the women joined the 1,000 guests
inside.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen founded Israeli Military Specialists, a Beverly Hills-based
security firm, after returning from a stint in the Israeli army a
couple of years ago and realized there was a high demand for security
services in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very expensive," he said. "Not everyone can afford us." Of
course he didn't want to name too many names (only Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan) but said his client list is strictly
A-list. "Big celebrities and corporate clients."</TE>
<TE>   Along with five DJs and two Israeli bands booked for the event,
Israeli party promoter Eyal Dahan hired Cohen and his company of
former Israeli military personnel, who were also positioned on
rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad swept the place for
explosives, and extra patrol officers were dispatched to the area for
the event.</TE>
<TE>   But the high security didn't dampen spirits inside the club, where
hundreds of revelers in tight dresses and tighter jeans packed the
dance floor and sang along to "Hevenu Shalom Aleichem," a song about
peace. The event was, among other things, a fund-raiser, with half
the proceeds from every $20 ticket going to Israeli ambulance
companies to help buy more vehicles, Dahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath the spotlights and sponsor banners, the crowd waved
several large Israeli flags over their heads, and the DJs seamlessly
segued into "It's Raining Men."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Leave It Be'</TE>
<TE>   Former gossip columnist George Christy confirmed yesterday that he
had quietly reached a settlement six weeks ago with the Screen Actors
Guild, which was investigating allegations that he had received Guild
benefits for films in which he did not actually appear. "We just
decided to leave it be, as they say," Christy said. "I'm delighted."</TE>
<TE>   Former Hollywood Reporter staffer Dave Robb, who covered the
Christy story last year, reports the settlement in the current L.A.
Weekly. SAG didn't comment on the settlement but released a statement
saying: "The SAG-Producer Pension &amp; Health Plans have completed their
audit of contributions made by various producers relating to work
performed by, and payments made to, George Christy, and have entered
into a settlement agreement with Mr. Christy. The plans are satisfied
that as a result of this settlement agreement, Mr. Christy will
receive health and pension benefits to which he is entitled under the
applicable collective bargaining agreements, and pension and health
plan documents."</TE>
<TE>   There was no public acknowledgment of the allegations that led to
Christy's five-month suspension from the Hollywood Reporter and his
subsequent resignation. Christy has always contended that he appeared
in all the films for which he received credit but that his roles were
sometimes edited out.</TE>

<HD>The Invisible Lightness of Beams</HD>
<DH>Company promotes Internet access via laser beams that zap
through windows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Look! Up in the sky, it's a ... well, actually, you can't see it. But
it's there.</LD>
<LD>   A company called Terabeam recently landed in Los Angeles and
announced plans to "send invisible light beams through the air
downtown."</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to meet some UFO wackos, we trekked to a Wilshire Boulevard
skyscraper and passed through a security checkpoint. Ascending to the
20th floor, we were greeted by humanoid creatures who--to our great
disappointment--insisted they were from a Seattle suburb, not another
galaxy.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, Terabeam is an odd enterprise. Founded five years ago by
an eccentric inventor, the company delivers high-speed Internet
access via laser beams zapped through office windows. It might sound
like science fiction, but Terabeam is actually borrowing technology
developed by the military during the Cold War, when submarines used
blue-green lasers to chat with satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Now, an infrared version of that system is hailed as the solution
to a problem that has vexed the telecommunications industry for
years. In trying to wire the nation for lightning-fast transmission
of movies, voice and other data, companies such as the now-bankrupt
Global Crossing have buried thousands of miles of fiber-optic cable.
But very few customers have been able to plug into the network.
That's because the information superhighway becomes a dirt road
inside most cities. Extending fiber-optic power to individual homes
and businesses means ripping up streets and sidewalks, a
time-consuming process that costs upward of $1 million per mile in
downtown areas.</TE>
<TE>   To bypass the roadblock, Terabeam and several competitors are
selling "fiber optics without the fiber." They install space-age
laser devices on high-rise rooftops and windowsills, then beam data
through the sky, building to building. Think of it as an electronic
version of the carrier pigeon, except this "pigeon" hauls enough
information to fill a 747 and flies at the speed of light.</TE>
<TE>   Like many a "revolutionary, paradigm-shattering,
we-can-be-filthy-rich" technology, this one is stained with red ink.
Lucent has poured $450 million into Terabeam, which laid off
employees last year; Nortel and Qualcomm are backing rival AirFiber,
also unprofitable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, questions linger. Will the lasers cook birds in
mid-flight? Does the system work in fog or through dirty windows?
And, can a nearsighted person perform do-it-yourself Lasik eye
surgery by staring into the laser?</TE>
<TE>   Terabeam officials have heard these queries before--except the one
about do-it-yourself eye surgery. Company boss Dan Hesse, who
previously ran AT&amp;T's Wireless division, insists the lasers are
harmless to birds and humans: "You can look directly into it for as
long as you want with no damage to your eye."</TE>
<TE>   Uh, go right ahead, Dan. We'll take your word for it.</TE>
<TE>   As for fog and other aerial impediments, Terabeam claims to have
eliminated all the bugs. For example, in downtown Seattle, where the
company debuted, laser transmitters were spaced close enough to their
targets that the beams could slice through the city's thick fog.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the Kingdome was imploded, the resulting cloud of dust
had no effect on Terabeam's service, said company spokesman Lou
Gellos.</TE>
<TE>   But using infrared lasers can still be tricky. For starters,
office windows come in hundreds of colors and glass styles, each of
which diffuses the light beam differently. Terabeam has a lab that
does nothing but test various types of mirrored glass so that the
company's equipment installers can adjust the laser signal
accordingly. Of course, they first have to find the beam, which is
invisible. For that, Terabeam has developed a hand-held beam
detector, which is similar to a stud finder but tracks infrared
light.</TE>
<TE>   Terabeam's customers include Microsoft, Seattle University and
four of the city's big hotels, which use the laser feed to give
guests super-quick Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of hotel guests, did we mention the Big Brother-style
cameras hidden inside each laser unit? During service outages, the
cameras relay pictures of the nearest laser transmitter to Terabeam
headquarters. Thus, when a Seattle law firm lost service last year,
Terabeam trouble-shooters instantly saw the problem: Someone had
thrown a coat over the firm's laser unit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Camera Solves Mystery: a Ship-Related Blip</TE>
<TE>   A similar incident happened in New York City after Sept. 11, when
Terabeam noticed a momentary blip in service between Merrill Lynch's
Manhattan office and a branch across the Hudson River (Terabeam had
set up the link after the attack on the World Trade Center severed
underground fiber-optic cables). Trouble-shooters rewound the
camera's tape and saw a Navy cruise ship mast gliding past, briefly
blocking the laser.</TE>
<TE>   Does this mean Terabeam can peep into hotel windows via laser
units aimed toward the building? At first, a company official
acknowledged the possibility: "At some level, yeah, you could see
other things [besides the laser unit]." But then he backpedaled,
noting that the pictures are "very grainy black and white" and
usually focused tightly on the laser unit itself.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't super cameras with telescopes," added spokesman
Gellos. "They can only make out basic shapes." In hotels, only
Terabeam's equipment is visible, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To showcase the advantages of Terabeam's service, Gellos arranged
a quirky demonstration. Sitting in the company's L.A. office, he
flicked on a TV screen linked to Seattle via fiber-optic cable and
digital video cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "Anne, are you there?" he said to an empty Seattle office. No
reply. A moment later, she materialized, armed with maracas, four TVs
and what appeared to be the world's largest pingpong paddle.</TE>
<TE>   To show how much data a single laser signal can carry, she turned
on her TV sets, which began playing four different digital movies
piped in on the same invisible light ray that was transmitting her
voice and image to Terabeam's L.A. office. "All of this is coming
into my office through this window," she said, motioning toward a
laser unit and the Seattle skyline behind her.</TE>
<TE>   She rattled the maracas for effect, then picked up the giant
pingpong paddle and walked to the laser device. Using the paddle like
a portable solar eclipse, she began blocking the laser beam. At
halfway toward total eclipse, the movies and the videoconference
continued flawlessly. But when the beam was 90% blocked, everything
froze. Once the paddle was removed, the movies resumed exactly where
they left off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Service Costs at Least $2,000 a Month</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Seattle, Terabeam operates in Denver, Dallas and
now Los Angeles, charging customers a minimum of $2,000 a month for
service. Company execs originally hoped to be in dozens of cities by
this time, but scaled back drastically as the economy stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Despite setbacks, the potential market for fiber optics has
attracted a variety of entrepreneurs. Some, like Terabeam, use
lasers. Others rely on microwave signals. Broadband Highway of Encino
uses both. And CityNet Telecommunications runs fiber-optic cable
through sewer lines, thus avoiding the cost of digging up streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of your toilet comes high-speed Internet access," says Peter
Fuhr, a San Jose State University electrical engineering professor
who worked on wireless optics for NASA. "It's an interesting idea."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows which method has the edge, let alone whether some
future technology might make them all obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Rutledge, who chairs the electrical engineering department at
Caltech, was hired by a Terabeam competitor to figure out whether the
laser idea is just a passing fad. Forbes magazine sides with the fad
contingent. "It sure sounds neat, but it always does at first," said
a May 2000 article critiquing Terabeam.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the concept proves viable, that's no guarantee it will
succeed. As Rutledge noted: "Sometimes, timing is more important than
technology. Is this the right time? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it would help if the lasers also cleaned the windows of any
building they zapped into.</TE>

<LD>SEA GLASS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Anita Shreve</LD>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   384 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anita Shreve's "Sea Glass" returns readers to the coastal home
that has figured prominently in two of her previous novels,
"Fortune's Rocks" and "The Pilot's Wife." Set in a small New
Hampshire town in the summer of 1929, "Sea Glass" charts a year in
the life of a young woman whose seemingly perfect marriage unravels
just after the stock market crash.</TE>
<TE>   Honora Willard meets her future husband, Sexton Beecher, when she
is just 20 and he is 24. The handsome, ambitious typewriter salesman
walks into the bank where she works one day, and within three months,
flirting leads to a marriage proposal, an offer Honora can't refuse.
"He was charming and persistent in a way she had never experienced
before," Shreve writes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sexton presents himself as successful and drives a brand
new Buick, Honora isn't sure if he's telling her the truth. She can't
help noticing Sexton's "too-tight collars and a sole coming loose
from a shoe. Sometimes the sleeves of his shirts were frayed at the
cuffs." Intertwined with the stories of Sexton and Honora are those
of the book's other characters: McDermott, who works at the local
mill, fixing looms; Francis, a fatherless boy whom McDermott looks
after; and Vivian, a Boston socialite who befriends Honora.</TE>
<TE>   As long as Sexton is successful, however, those characters are not
too involved in their lives. It's just Honora and Sexton, focused on
each other, beginning a promising new life together in the beach
house at Fortune's Rocks. The fixer-upper house is a former convent,
three stories high, white with black shutters. At first they rent it,
but when the owner offers to sell the house for $4,000, Sexton
decides they have to buy it. "He wants it so much that it sometimes
makes his hands shake," Shreve writes.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't explain the feeling to himself rationally. Rationally,
the house is no bargain.... And yet ... and yet ... if he can just
secure this one thing, have this one possession, he will feel that
somehow he's ahead of the game. That he's gotten the jump on life."
While Sexton is preoccupied with scoring the next big deal and Honora
is a lonely housewife, Shreve conveys well the silences and
concessions prevalent in a marriage, the gestures made just to keep
the peace.</TE>
<TE>   It's obvious that purchasing the house is the wrong thing to do,
and that disaster will come of it, but Sexton is so blinded by his
need for success that he never stops to find out what his cautious
wife wants. Since Honora has no clue what her husband has done to get
the house (taking out loans they can't afford), she goes along with
whatever he wants, hoping that their finances are still in order.</TE>
<TE>   It's after Sexton leads them to ruin, following the stock market
crash, that "Sea Glass" begins its descent into melodrama and
violence. The pieces of sea glass that Honora has been collecting
each day take on a portentous meaning. Sexton becomes so evasive that
his lonely wife turns to McDermott for comfort and companionship.</TE>
<TE>   When Sexton loses his sales job, he works at a local mill and
becomes involved with a workers' strike that turns dangerous. A group
of men, including McDermott, sets up shop at the Beechers' house,
where they develop a plan to demand higher wages and fair treatment.
Only Vivian offers moments of comic relief, as she "tries to imagine
what it would feel like to know that one had lost everything ... that
one could never go to Havana or throw a party at the Plaza Hotel.
That one would have to get a job. She tries to picture what possible
work she could find if it happened to her, and that thought frightens
her." And at the peak of the workers' strike, only Vivian could be
concerned about having to get her emerald ring sized, a task she has
been meaning to do all summer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being shielded from the harsh realities of the Depression,
Vivian proves a sympathetic, loyal friend to Honora and is perhaps
the most subtly drawn character in the novel. Honora is
pure-thinking, beautiful, kind and as forgiving as a saint; Sexton is
an oily, unhappy man who inevitably suffers a tragic fate; McDermott
is a rugged, honest Irish Catholic who quietly awaits the day that he
can express his love for Honora. And Francis is a poor boy who finds
the perfect father-figure hero in McDermott, and whose every
utterance reveals his innocence and goodness.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame that Shreve doesn't seem to trust that her
characters' relationships will suffice in maintaining interest, or
know that a little complexity in a person isn't a bad thing. In the
latter half of the novel, Shreve relies heavily on plot, which
becomes full of foreshadowing that devastation is to come. Aside from
a few forced efforts at lyricism, however, she is able to strike a
balance between being a commercial writer and a literary one. And
"Sea Glass" is a novel that manages, impressively, to stay absorbing
even when it seems melodramatic or predictable.</TE>

<LD>New York designer Anthony Castro's new collection, V, didn't break
new ground, but it was immensely wearable, with sexy wool and jersey
separates with lots of motocross style.</LD>
<LD>   A chocolate tweed cycle jacket and matching skinny tweed pants
with zippers at the ankles, worn over a charmeuse peach floral halter
top, spoke to the biker chick aesthetic.</LD>
<LD>   There were zippers at the pockets of black wool stretch pants and
up the sides of a black and charcoal striped skirt, too. But the
details were subtle enough to keep the clothes from looking
costume-y.</LD>

<LD>It wasn't New York, but that was exactly the point made by the
Coalition of Los Angeles Designers and the crowd that cheered the
nine collections presented Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Among the standouts were Goretti, designed by Monica Behan and
Desiree Kohan, who successfully pulled off an eclectic mix of fabrics
and looks such as a cream leather vest teamed with a flounced tulle
lace skirt over tulle ruched leggings. Mona Thalheimer of Mona &amp; Co.
presented a very wearable and beautiful collection of body-hugging
mohair separates embellished with circle and floral embroidery. And
Carina Gulian's Electric Barbarella line of low-slung jeans was
adorned with corsetry along the hips and trimmed with leather down
the legs.</LD>
<LD>   Designers included Naqada by Octavio Carlin, Ten:02 by Lauren
Reynolds, Nikolaki by Nick Verreos and David Paul, Eisbar by Bobby
Benveniste and Kiernan Lambeth, and Mhope by Marla Hope. CLAD's fifth
show was the nonprofit group's best production yet. CLAD tidings,
indeed.</LD>

<LD>Coats and dresses with an aristocratic elegance were the showpieces
of Cornell Collins' most polished collection to date.</LD>
<LD>   A silver mohair coat shaped through the waist had a feminine,
1950s feel, as did a beautifully draped, gray wool satin gabardine
dress with a cowl back.</LD>
<LD>   Collins delighted in his details: A pinch-tucked, gray silk poplin
shirt was top-stitched around the collar and cuffs, gray wool tweed
pants were updated with a wider cuff, and a mink collar provided a
nice counterpoint to a delicate, green paisley print chiffon dress.</LD>
<TE>   He proved once again that he's a designer to go to for a ball
gown. The show's finale, a strip-layered, bias-cut dress in a
brilliant shade of periwinkle, left the audience wanting an encore.</TE>

<LD>Jared Gold's Black Chandelier collection was full of wearable looks
with a sense of humor, including a black circle skirt with
robot-shaped patches, a black miniskirt trimmed in pink and red
"brothel fringe," as Gold described it, and a blue shirtdress
embellished with a pinstriped ruffle hem.</LD>
<LD>   He presented made-to-order dresses in fiery shades of red that
arrested the senses--one a crazy concoction of tulle, sequins and
suede, modeled by a female fire-eater who had flames shooting out of
her fingers. It all made the audience a bit nervous, but that was
probably the point. Gold never fails to hold our attention.</LD>

<LD>The 25-year-old designer emerged last season as one of the bright
spots of L.A.'s fashion week. He exhibited a sensibility that
interestingly melded modern and ethnic silhouettes. But his new
17-piece fall collection revealed a strong imagination that hasn't
quite caught up to his sewing skill, even though he's a more
accomplished tailor than many of his L.A. peers. Like many young
designers, Kashou fell prey to the idea of exaggerating the season's
prevailing ideas. So flared legs were hugely so, fringe grew to
yard-long lengths and multiple loops flapped from tops or dresses
until they became tripping hazards.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, the ideas all came together well, such as when the long
fringe cascaded from a belt or added a pleasing wiggle to structured
gaucho pants.</LD>

<LD>Eric Martin and Diane Moss-Martin promised an exploration of the
avant-garde, but their mixed references to Japan's Yohji Yamamoto,
Rei Kawakubo and Junya Watanabe deflated any hopes that the duo have
a unique vision. Their mostly black, 25-piece collection displayed
variations on pleats. The folds crossed over shirt fronts, decorated
skirt hems and hung like an apron over pants.</LD>
<LD>   But the pair purposely undermine their expert tailoring by leaving
hems ragged, fabrics wrinkled and edges fashionably raw. Perhaps the
faux moth holes have a purpose: Who's to mind a fresh cigarette burn
after a night of clubbing?</LD>

<LD>So now that the runway shows are over, what's the future of L.A.
fashion week?</LD>
<LD>   "If you build buzz, they will come," said David Caruso, marketing
director at IMG. The sports and entertainment marketing firm is
planning to produce fashion shows for the first time here in
November. The shows will probably take place over a couple of days
rather than a week, Caruso said Tuesday in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   IMG produces New York's fashion week and several others around the
world, as well as representing a stable of talent, including top
models Gisele Bundchen and Alek Wek, that Caruso hopes to tap for the
runways in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Until a formal announcement is made in the next few weeks, Caruso
could only say that IMG is in the process of signing a title sponsor
and looking at venues for the abbreviated fashion week of the future.
He would not say which designers would be invited to participate but
mentioned Richard Tyler, Jeremy Scott, Rick Owens, Cornell Collins,
Rami Kashou and Magda Berliner as possibilities.</TE>

<LD>Say Hello!</LD>
<LD>   You can eat kimchi if you aren't Korean and bagels if you aren't
Jewish. Enjoying foods from different cultures is easy in Southern
California, which is home to people from more than 300 countries.
Maybe you were born in another country or you know someone who was.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes people moving to a new country feel shy or scared. You
can help make someone new at school feel welcome. All you have to do
is say hello. But what if the new person is just learning English,
and the language he or she speaks is unfamiliar to you?</LD>
<TE>   Try saying hello in these languages. Because many languages have
different alphabets than ours, only pronunciations are given. Be sure
to stress the syllables written in capital letters. Practice a
little. You can make many people feel welcome in Southern California.</TE>

by yourself. Here are two of them.</LD>
<LD>   Who Am I?</LD>
<LD>   I am a little girl,</LD>
<TE>   I like to dance and whirl,</TE>
<TE>   People say I act like a little girl,</TE>
<TE>   And I say, "I am a little girl,"</TE>
<TE>   But when they say,</TE>
<TE>   "Act more mature,"</TE>
<TE>   I say, "I am not mature,</TE>
<TE>   "I am a little her."</TE>
<TE>   I am in sixth grade,</TE>
<TE>   I love drinkin' lemonade,</TE>
<TE>   I hate the sun, I love the shade,</TE>
<TE>   I also like jewels and jade,</TE>
<TE>   I am a she,</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, I am me.</TE>
<TE>   --Emily, 11</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My Little Friend</TE>
<TE>   I have a little friend,</TE>
<TE>   Who looks just like me,</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes he can be</TE>
<TE>   A little nasty.</TE>
<TE>   You can only see him</TE>
<TE>   With a light shining on me,</TE>
<TE>   Can you guess</TE>
<TE>   Who my friend can be?</TE>
<TE>   He could be a flea,</TE>
<TE>   He could be the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Who could he be?</TE>
<TE>   Why, he's the shadow of me!</TE>
<TE>   --Jacob, third grade</TE>

<LD>University presses, one of the pillars of American intellectual life,
are in trouble, beset by mounting financial losses and an ongoing
identity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The latest victim of this trend is the University of California
Press, the West's most prestigious publisher and, as measured by
sales revenues, one of its largest.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a general retrenchment, the UC Press no longer will
produce books on philosophy, architecture, archeology, political
science or geography. It will publish dramatically less literature
and far fewer works of literary theory. Twelve jobs already have been
eliminated through attrition, and further job cuts are planned.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost more than $1 million last year, and other large
university presses had losses in the same range," said Lynne Withey,
the acting director of UC Press. "In fact, all of the major
university presses lost money in the last fiscal year. Some of us
just lost more than others."</TE>
<TE>   Although the press is one of the nation's most important scholarly
publishers, the University of California subsidizes just a little
more than 7% of its budget. The rest must come from sales revenues,
which last year amounted to $15 million from books and $3 million
from journals.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very bad year for the big university presses," Withey
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just trim a little here or cut a little over there
anymore. We need to make changes in the kinds of books we publish."</TE>
<TE>   To decide what those changes would be, the UC Press enlisted the
consulting firm of McKinsey and Co., which offered its help pro bono.
The consultants' recommendation, according to Withey, was that UC
follow the lead of MIT and reduce its list to those fields where its
sales are strongest. MIT, for example, now publishes works in only a
handful of disciplines and subspecialties, including art and
architecture, cognitive science and German philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   McKinsey, Withey said, "came up with a formula under which we will
do 80% of our business in six fields where we're already
strong"--history, anthropology, sociology, religion, biology and
natural history.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very hard to abandon things like philosophy, which is a
core discipline in the academy," Withey said. "The whole process has
been a series of painful decisions, but we didn't have any choice in
the matter."</TE>
<TE>   At least one UC scholar was, well, philosophical about the
cutbacks. "Given the reality of the marketplace as a force in our
lives, there is only so much money you can lose," said John R.
Searle, a professor of philosophy at UC Berkeley. "Obviously I want
more books to be published--especially, good philosophy books--but
you can't go on losing money on them forever," said Searle, whose
work has made him one of the world's most important philosophers of
mind and language.</TE>
<TE>   But another of Berkeley's leading scholars disagrees. "Even apart
from this cutback, the mandate of university presses has been gravely
undermined over the past few years," said Robert Alter, professor of
Hebrew and comparative literature. "The idea originally was that
bringing out serious works that were a contribution to scholarship,
but not viable for a commercial publisher, was the university press'
obligation to the world of knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say, for example," said Alter, "that you were doing a
monograph on an obscure--now unread--English romantic poet.
Traditionally, a university press would feel they needed to publish
that work, though perhaps only in an edition of 800 copies. That
impulse is almost entirely gone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State of Broadcast News</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, the deans of America's nine leading journalism schools
will gather at the Bay Area home of philanthropist Walter H.
Shorenstein--founder of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government--to discuss "the terrible state of broadcast news,"
according to their host, Orville Schell, dean of UC Berkeley's
graduate school of journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Schell said he would like to see the deans "knit together a
collective voice" with which they can address "commercial
broadcasting's long slide away from quality news coverage."</TE>
<TE>   "On our minds most selfishly," Schell said, "is the question of
where our students will be able to find dignified jobs in broadcast
news. Hardly a week goes by that I don't have trooping through my
office somebody in television news who is looking for a place to
jump. Many are broadcast journalists at the top of their careers,
people in good outlets with big salaries. They feel deprived of
dignity by what they have to do. They're depressed, and I don't blame
them.</TE>
<TE>   "So we thought we might all get together and talk about what we
can do. I think we all agree that we need to do more research on
exactly what the drafters of the Communications Act of 1934 had in
mind when they said broadcasters have 'to operate in the public
interest.' What is the role of the marketplace, which in my mind is
deeply implicated in the qualitative implosion of broadcast news?</TE>
<TE>   "At the very least, we need to ring the alarm and get people
thinking about how the hell this country is not going to go
brain-dead politically unless it improves the quality of broadcast
news," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Works in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Father Richard McBrien, professor of theology at the University of
Notre Dame, is author of "Lives of the Popes" and writes a weekly
column, "Essays in Theology," that has appeared in the American
Catholic press for nearly 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to appeal to the broadest possible audience. I'm not
interested in investing a lot of time and energy in a book that will
be read by a few hundred fellow scholars.</TE>
<TE>   "My major work, 'Catholicism,' has sold more than 200,000 copies
since it was first published in 1980. My latest book, 'Lives of the
Saints,' which appeared last June, is selling about 1,000 copies a
month. Those aren't Tom Clancy or John Grisham figures, but they're
not bad in the theology field.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my next book clearly in mind and will get started on the
actual project in the next few weeks. It will be a one-volume
synthesis of all the work I've done over the years in my specialty,
which is ecclesiology--the study of the church, its nature, mission,
ministries and organizational structure. It will be a work of
theology but with biblical, historical, doctrinal, liturgical,
spiritual and canonical components.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not avoid controversial topics."</TE>

<HD>B&amp;W Ball's Dress Code Falls Into a Gray Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I have been invited to the San Francisco Black
and White Ball in June. I have a long, straight, black velvet gown
with a black velvet, sleeveless jacket that has a large, white satin
collar and a gold and rhinestone button. Would this be inappropriate
to wear?</LD>
<LD>   --SPELL IT OUT IN</LD>
<LD>   BLACK AND WHITE</LD>
<TE>   Dear Spell: San Francisco's annual Black and White Ball bills
itself as "the world's most extravagant block party." It started in
the 1950s and draws some 15,000 people to the streets for music,
dancing, food and general celebration, and it benefits the San
Francisco Symphony. The dress code, as the name implies, is black-tie
or "tastefully rendered" black and white, as the organizers suggest,
which we're sure is interpreted thousands of interesting ways.</TE>
<TE>   Normally we wouldn't be keen on a long, black velvet dress for a
summer-evening event, but since San Francisco weather can be windy,
cool, or even chilly in June, we'll give it a thumbs-up. We're a
little concerned with the sleeveless jacket, though; if the dress is
also sleeveless, you might be a human Popsicle by the end of the
evening. A long-sleeve velvet jacket or even a wool or hefty velvet
shawl might be a better choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: Am I the only woman on the planet who doesn't
favor jeans or slacks or sweatpants for nonbusiness wear? I like
dresses--not those infamous flowered housedresses, just your basic
tank or short-sleeve dress (cotton or linen) for summer. I spend most
of my day at a computer or in the garden, so tight waists and
above-knee hemlines are not a plus. It used to be so easy to find
these dresses. I have several old ones unraveling in my closet, the
newest one probably 10 years old. Do you have any ideas?</TE>
<TE>   --LONGING</TE>
<TE>   Dear Longing: We have dresses. Although there are plenty of minis
for spring and summer, there's also a substantial amount of longer,
comfy cotton styles you (and many others) are looking for. One of the
best resources we found was the Chadwick's of Boston catalog, which
has a plethora of cute, reasonably priced dresses (www.chadwicks.com,
or call [800] 677-0340). There are too many to mention, so we'll
focus on the highlights: a snap-front, short-sleeve, cotton-knit
dress for $29; a denim tank dress with floral embroidery for $34; a
cap-sleeve, scoop-neck dress for $29, and a sleeveless tank dress
with matching hooded jacket for $39.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Proper catalog also has a black, poor-boy-ribbed tank
dress for $69 (www.bostonproper.com, or call [800] 243-4300), and
Lands' End offers a short-sleeve, T-shirt dress with subtle stripes
for $46 (www.land send.com, or call [800] 963-4816).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Confidential to Al Gore: You're back in the spotlight in a big
way, Mr. Former Vice Prez, and it looks like the Democrats are ready
to give you a big old hug to welcome you. But are you ready to hug
them back? Judging from your recent appearance at the Florida
Democratic State Conference, we're not so sure. Because when you
lifted up your arms, all we saw were sweat stains the size of
hubcaps. They went up to your shoulder. And though we appreciate the
whole doffing-the-jacket look, those eye-popping circles of moisture
were extremely disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of Hollywood celebs get those Botox injections to temporarily
stop their sweat glands from pouring forth. If that sounds too
drastic, how about trying some CoolMax T-shirts, which are supposed
to wick the wetness away (the Travelsmith catalog sells them for
$24.50)? Just a friendly word of advice, should you decide to run for
president again, those serving-platter-size stains could be a
liability. The public will know you're working hard. You don't have
to show it the evidence.</TE>

<KH>L.A. Fashion Week</KH>
<HD>Buying Into Hometown Style</HD>
<DH>Veteran retailer Shauna Stein goes in search of local
talent and is pleasantly surprised at some of what she finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faint rays of early evening sun filter through the palm trees in the
courtyard of the historic Los Altos apartment building where guests
are arriving for the first runway show of L.A. fashion week. Veteran
retailer Shauna Stein is sipping white wine out of a plastic cup and
soaking in the scene. In her 25 years in the fashion business, the
co-owner of the On Beverly Blvd. boutique has made the runway rounds
in Milan, Paris and New York, but never here.</LD>
<LD>   She meets a stylist named Kristen with big, permed blond hair,
who's wearing a turquoise tennis sweater, red gym shorts, yellow
fishnet stockings and pink Converse high tops. It's a carefully
calculated mix of cool that intrigues the 51-year-old Stein.</LD>
<LD>   The "mix" is one of her favorite buzzwords, because to keep her
advantage as a small retailer, Stein is constantly interpreting,
editing and combining designer looks for her customers. She's earned
a reputation for being able to pick apart a collection and find
clothes that are edgy, but not so edgy as to be unwearable.</LD>
<TE>   She's also known for her personal touch. Stein claims more than
200 loyal clients, who occasionally call her at home to ask what top
to wear with a bottom. "I don't always remember names," she says.
"But I do remember what's in everyone's closet."</TE>
<TE>   In the courtyard of the Los Altos on Wilshire Boulevard, Stein has
gathered an audience, and the first of many fashion musings flow:
"Shopgirls in Europe look better than the richest women in L.A.
because they understand from an early age to buy less and buy
better."</TE>
<TE>   It was her first trip to Italy in 1972 that changed her eye
forever. "I saw a way of dressing and mixing clothing that inspired
my career," says the always animated Stein, whose sentences tumble
out rapidly, often punctuated at the end with an infectious,
high-pitched, open-mouth laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd files into the lobby for Rami Kashou's show. His
elegant, bias-cut jersey gowns dazzle Stein, who sizes up the fabric,
the finishing, the fit. "Soft dressing is going to be very
important," she says.</TE>
<TE>   After the presentation, it's clear that the designer has won her
over. "He's so cute, he's delicious," she coos, her enormous green
eyes opening even wider. "I didn't expect to like an L.A. fashion
show."</TE>
<TE>   Women have been looking to Stein for style advice since the 1970s
when she was a buyer for Ron Ross on Ventura Boulevard and the late
1980s when she owned her own store at the Beverly Center, introducing
such designers as John Galliano, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Moschino to the
legging-wearing L.A. public.</TE>
<TE>   Buying was easier back then. Each season brought a few trends that
women followed diligently. Hems went up and down and wardrobes
followed.</TE>
<TE>   These days, fashion moves so fast that Stein herself has trouble
keeping up. "The Internet has brought us to this place where you
really have to do your homework so you're not caught up in trends
that are going to be over in 20 minutes," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Stores typically buy clothes twice a year, for spring and fall.
But now, trends change so quickly that Stein feels like she has to
restock every 60 days to stay current.</TE>
<TE>   The fall show schedule began back in February in New York. But by
the time those clothes hit stores, Stein fears they could be out of
date. So this season, she vowed to check out her hometown offerings
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Because L.A. fashion week is last on the international calendar,
attending the shows here could give Stein an opportunity to buy
fresher looks.</TE>
<TE>   Stein has been lost for 40 minutes trying to find the factory
space in Culver City where Richard Tyler is showing. "I wound up at
the marina," she says, arriving uncharacteristically late. She checks
any frustration at the door, remembering how difficult it was to get
to Gaultier's shows in the '80s, which were held outside Paris. "You
took your life into your hands."</TE>
<TE>   As the lights go down, she pulls out a notepad. Short jackets,
sheer skirts and sexy dresses parade by as Stein's eyes play fashion
tennis, darting back and forth along the runway.</TE>
<TE>   "That bag!" she says excitedly, pointing to a brown leather
saddlebag on a model's shoulder. "This is extremely salable for L.A.
He really knows his client."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it will work in Stein's store--which has everything from
$75 T-shirts to $5,000 coats--is another story.</TE>
<TE>   She has to consider her clients, who span three generations.</TE>
<TE>   The Tyler collection is young and tightfitting. "Skinny is the
biggest part of the culture in L.A.," says Stein, who has a fuller
figure herself. "But I'm not a [size] 4, 6, 8 store; I'm a [size] 6,
8, 12 store. I try to allow more medium-sized women to buy fashion."</TE>
<TE>   After making two U-turns on Cole Avenue in Hollywood, Stein spots
number 1051. "You can go to some of the creepiest places and find
clothes," she says sizing up the dingy building. "You should see
where I found Galliano in London. I went up six flights of stairs in
the grimiest walk-up."</TE>
<TE>   She takes a front-row folding chair for the first show from
Deseo23, a design collective of four recent grads of Brooks College
in Long Beach. The smell of incense is hanging in the air over the
runway--a bed of dirt and red clay with abstract sculptures for
props.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm searching for that thrill of finding the next thing. I'm
almost like an addict," Stein says, running her hand through her long
brown hair, which she says has never been cut short.</TE>
<TE>   A half hour ticks by and the show still hasn't started. Stein fans
herself with her notepad. The Indian chants that a DJ is spinning are
beginning to take their toll. "This music is driving me crazy," she
snaps.</TE>
<TE>   Models finally start coming out from behind the gray scrim. They
strike important-looking poses in corduroy pants to the tune of a
song with one annoying refrain: "Little black spiders."</TE>
<TE>   It's looking less likely that Deseo23 will be the next Galliano.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Stein applauds politely before making a beeline for
the door. She says, "It took four people to make that collection?"</TE>
<TE>   By 3:30, her black Jeep Cherokee is headed east on Santa Monica
Boulevard. With time to kill, she is easily persuaded to go shopping.
She's the first one to offer that she "doesn't get out much," so
she's thrilled to have time to wander in Los Feliz, a new
neighborhood for her. She lives in Beverly Glen in L.A. and most of
her activity is between home and her store, across from the Beverly
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "This was me at age 25," she says, tugging at a pair of white
pants trimmed with antique lace. "That's the worst thing about
getting old. You can't wear the same things." These days, her
personal style includes a "feminine/masculine mix" of long skirts and
boots, often by Jean-Paul Gaultier or Roberto Cavalli. She carries a
black, bohemian-looking Jamin Peuch crocheted purse she bought in
Paris in the late 1980s. She says, "I just don't want it to die."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as she opens the program at the martinMartin show, she
knows what to expect. "Black Japanese viscose," Stein says, pointing
to the printed description of the first outfit. "That means
intellectual."</TE>
<TE>   "Intellectual" is the word she uses to describe the style created
by designers such as Issey Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto in the 1980s.
It's avant-garde, often all-black with severe shapes. It was the one
trend Stein never bought into.</TE>
<TE>   She's right about the show, which is black and serious, with pants
and coats that look like they have moth holes in them. Outside on the
street, she says, "My only question is does intellectual live in
L.A.? Because I just can't sell clothes here that aren't sexy."</TE>
<TE>   "This is like the Algonquin of fashion," Stein says exchanging a
tip about the latest denim line with a buyer from Alabama who's
sitting with her at Koi restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The wait for the Anthony Castro's V show to start is nearly two
hours long, but Stein is enjoying herself, devouring California rolls
and passing out business cards faster than a Vegas dealer. She says
"hello" to everyone from Loree Rodkin, a friend of Cher whom she's
known for years, to Jennifer Klegg, who works for a new sportswear
company Stein discovered at CaliforniaMart just this morning.</TE>
<TE>   She's an expert at networking but doesn't seem driven by the will
to sell as much as the genuine desire to help people. She may be a
career fashionista, but there's a certain down-to-earth quality about
Stein, who grew up in Salt Lake City, the daughter of parents who
"shopped at JCPenney," and is a practicing Mormon.</TE>
<TE>   She raised two children from her husband's previous marriage and
is most definitely the mothering type. One reason she wanted to
attend the L.A. shows was to be a resource for young designers.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the show starts, it's almost an afterthought to the
mingling. Stein proclaims the collection mediocre. "I'm sorry," she
says, "but these people need to hear it."</TE>
<TE>   She's dragged husband Marty, a Harley-riding former apparel
manufacturer, to a desolate-looking building on Spring Street for the
Jared Gold show. The two, who have been married 30 years, both love
to talk--especially about clothes. They sit across the runway from a
woman wearing what appears to be a pink towel on her head and giggle
like teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Stein watches the show intently. A juggler and a fire-eater come
down the runway, ahead of two models wearing one dress to look like
Siamese twins. She's seen it all before.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun and creative, but it's not what I do," she says
afterward. Still, she sees the value of it. "The fashion business
needs the context of collections like these, and there must be a
market for it," she says. "The girl in the towel strikes me as
someone who probably wears this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   It's like a fashion family reunion at the Cornell Collins show.
Stein's sister, Cynthia Kezerian, is in town to shop market week for
her own store, CJ Sport, in Park City, Utah. Tonight, she's along for
the wild runway ride.</TE>
<TE>   Stein bumps into some of her "hippie friends" from the 1970s,
including Jose Irizarry, who was a stylist at Cassandra, the hair
salon that shared the block with Ron Ross in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We all became really creative because we were sitting in the
middle of a cowboy town," Stein says. "We would be doing clothes and
hair and a horse would walk by our window. There was a coral in the
back of the store."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Baruch, chief executive of Fred Segal Beauty is
supervising hair and makeup for the show. He comes over to say hi.
"When I was growing up in L.A. in the 1980s, I don't know whose name
I heard more in my household, Shauna Stein's or Stevie Nicks'," he
says. "She had her finger on what was hot and what was not. And she
was the only game in town."</TE>
<TE>   After fashion week, Stein is so exhausted, she goes to work at the
store one morning in her pajamas. She'll revisit Kashou, Tyler and
Collins, looking at their collections in the showroom, before placing
any orders. And she'll definitely hit the L.A. shows again next
season, reserving money in her budget to buy here because "I have to
be in and out of a trend before a season is over."</TE>
<TE>   As for the other designers she saw, "They need to do their
homework," Stein says. "Fashion is really fun and creative, but the
bottom line today is that you have to have someone to sell it to."</TE>

<HD>Max Makes a Friend</HD>
<DH>Part 5 / The story so far: Max has to tie his shoe by
himself before Mr. Peters calls for the class to line up.</DH>

<LD>Max could feel the sting on his fingertips from hitting the ball so
hard.</LD>
<LD>   "Mr. Peters is going to call us to line up," Ray said to Max.</LD>
<LD>   "I know. That's why I'm tying my shoe," Max said, trying to be
brave. He bent down on one knee, pushed one lace under the other and
pulled tight.</LD>
<TE>   "So far, so good," Max said to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Peters is opening the classroom door!" Ray said.</TE>
<TE>   Max felt frozen. He didn't want to be rushed. He couldn't think
straight. Sweat started dripping off his face. He could feel his
hands getting sweaty.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll help you, Max," Ruben whispered, seeing that he was nervous.
"I'll go talk to Mr. Peters about my homework so you have another
minute," he said, and he ran toward the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Max felt better. He tried to hear the words in his head that his
sister had told him about bunny ears and tying shoes, but it all
seemed so confusing with Ray standing over him, watching.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Max grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Ray," he said, looking up. "Want me to buy us both chocolate
chip cookies at lunchtime today?"</TE>
<TE>   "How?" Ray asked. "You don't even have a dollar to give me."</TE>
<TE>   "Like this," Max said. And with those words, Max's fingers made
magic on his shoe.</TE>
<TE>   When Ray</TE>
<TE>   looked down,</TE>
<TE>   Max's shoe</TE>
<TE>   was perfectly</TE>
<TE>   tied.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody line up!" bellowed Mr. Peters, standing outside the
classroom door.</TE>
<TE>   Max stood up. Ray looked surprised. Ruben was returning to the
line, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "How did you do it?" Ruben asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing to it!" Max said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be Ray's friend, and I'm going to buy all three of us
cookies at lunch today!"</TE>
<TE>   Ruben looked at Ray. Ray looked at Max. All three kids were
smiling.</TE>

<HD>Women Retool One Aspect of Home Repair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, a clutch of professional women in Denver was invited
to a home party where upscale kitchenware was being sold.</LD>
<LD>   As they were leaving together, they grumbled that the last thing
they needed was another copper pan or veggie steamer. "What we really
need," Sue Wilson recalls saying, "are parties where we can buy great
tools."</LD>
<LD>   Today, Wilson and four pals are principals in an online company
that sells hammers, screwdrivers, pruners and garden gloves designed
especially for women, along with providing do-it-yourself advice,
links to product sources and chat rooms where customers can network
about unplugging drains and regluing chairs.</LD>
<TE>   "We were all doing the repairs in our own houses, but the tools we
were finding at retail didn't work for us," said Wilson, the chief
executive of Tomboy Tools.</TE>
<TE>   "Hardware stores think that in order to appeal to women, you just
take a tool made for a man and make it pink," she said. "But we knew
exactly what was needed: professional-grade hand tools that were
lightweight but effective, durable, easy to store, designed to fit a
woman's smaller hand and, above all, not pink."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of home-improvement products are at an all-time high--$187.6
billion last year, according to the Home Improvement Research
Institute--and women are a major part of that surge. "The idea wasn't
just to put a tool in your hand," said Wilson. "Tool kits were a
major component, but educating consumers was equally important. We
say, 'Here it is,' tell you how to use it, and show you the steps to
completing a project."</TE>
<TE>   After searching the international market for products and
designing the Web site, including links to home repair sites, Tomboy
Tools was launched in February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven months later, Tomboy tools.com went online and has been
expanding since.</TE>

<HD>Dreams Die Hard in Gritty 'Chelsea Walls'</HD>
<DH>In his directorial debut, actor Ethan Hawke displays a deft
hand in bringing the N.Y. hotel's array of compulsive, creative
characters to life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Chelsea Walls" is a beautiful, poetic film that captures the
aspirations and struggles of a group of creative residents of
Manhattan's landmark Chelsea Hotel, legendary home to artists and
writers for whom it was built, a haven for such giants as Mark Twain,
Thomas Wolfe, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Dylan Thomas and
many others. Ethan Hawke, in his feature directorial debut, has
brought Nicolette Burdette's play to the screen with fluid grace and
a perfect blend of dreaminess and grit, expressed in camerawork that
seems to float and in Jeff Tweedy's shimmering, gently insistent
score.</LD>
<LD>   As an actor, Hawke has a mature, detached compassion for his
fellow artists and their self-destructive, self-indulgent tendencies
that not all audiences will be able to match. "Chelsea Walls" is for
those sympathetic to the notion that creative aspirations sometimes
are accompanied by indolent, insufferable behavior. But for those who
are touched by the vulnerability of this film's characters, "Chelsea
Walls" is a rewarding experience, admittedly romantic rather than
realistic in tone, but ringing ruefully true to human nature. In
spirit "Chelsea Walls'' is closer to Wim Wenders' recent, dreamlike
"The Million Dollar Hotel," set in L.A.'s own venerable Rosslyn, than
Andy Warhol's "Chelsea Girls" or, for that matter, even "Sid and
Nancy," both of which were set in the Chelsea.</LD>
<TE>   Anchoring the film and heading a formidable cast, Kris
Kristofferson is Bud, a hard-drinking macho novelist who's beginning
to feel the fear of aging and loneliness but also fears he might
destroy his beautiful, still-loving wife (a radiant Tuesday Weld)
from whom he is separated, should she attempt to save him. On the
other hand, his much-younger latest lover (Natasha Richardson) is
beginning to feel that his true mistress is his work. "I am a man,"
he declares. "There are only three men left--unfortunately, we're all
drunks." It's a line Kristofferson gets away with in amused fashion
as few could.</TE>
<TE>   Uma Thurman and Rosario Dawson are poets not only striving in
their difficult art but also to hold on to their elusive men. The
first is in the thrall of a Hollywood filmmaker, heard only from one
side of a phone conversation but clearly a selfish jerk, to the
extent that she's indifferent to the shy overtures of Vincent
D'Onofrio's sensitive painter. The second senses that she's in danger
of losing her sweet but immature lover (Mark Webber, of Todd
Solandz's "Storytelling") to the temptations of gambling, personified
by his dissolute pal (Kevin Corrigan). Thurman's poet makes ends meet
by working in a club in the hotel's basement where none other than
"Little" Jimmy Scott holds forth; his Skinny Bones is also a Chelsea
resident.</TE>
<TE>   Holed up in a small room hard by the hotel's tall neon sign,
Robert Sean Leonard's Terry is a gifted singer-composer longing for a
girl back home but not about to leave New York for Minnesota and
faced with a pal (Steve Zahn) who's more intent on partying than
creating music. Among numerous supporting players to this impressive
ensemble are such notables as Harris Yulin and Guillermo Diaz. Hawke
draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated
portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the
poetic flights in Burdette's dialogue. "Chelsea Walls," which
resonates with an awareness of the hotel's hallowed residents of the
past in the midst of a decidedly seedy present, is special--and
luminous.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: R, for language. Times guidelines: Besides strong
language, film features heavy drinking; adult themes and situations.</TE>

<HD>R. Kelly Faces a Boycott as Sexual Allegations Swirl</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Singer is accused of having sex with minors,
captured on videotape. A tour was canceled, but no charges have been
filed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOU CARLOZO</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Most music fans know R. Kelly for his uplifting Grammy-winning hit "I
Believe I Can Fly" and singing "The World's Greatest" at the opening
ceremony of this year's Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   But recently, after a series of negative media stories swirling
around his personal life, groups are boycotting his music, his record
sales have fallen, a tour was canceled and he has been publicly
shunned by star rapper Jay-Z and other members of the hip-hop
community.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for this is the recent emergence of one, or perhaps
more, videos that purportedly show a man who looks like Kelly
(according to those who have seen one of the tapes) having sex with
young females who appear to be underage. Kelly has attacked the
footage as fake, but in the wake of negative publicity surrounding
it, sales of his new album with Jay-Z, "The Best of Both Worlds,"
slipped 60% between the weeks ending March 31 and April 14.</LD>
<TE>   For another artist, having a gold album (500,000 sold) would be
worth bragging about. But for Kelly, it's a major disappointment,
given the triple-platinum success of his last album, "TP-2.com," in
2000 and the pairing with the hugely popular Jay-Z. And although some
in the music business say the new material simply isn't up to snuff,
recent controversies swirling around Kelly aren't helping the cause
either. The media coverage of the tapes has left Kelly "devastated,"
according to his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B singer Stephanie Edwards (who goes by the stage name Sparkle)
has claimed in a radio interview that her 14-year-old niece appears
in the video. Edwards, a former Kelly protege who has released at
least two CDs, spoke earlier this month on Los Angeles station
KKBT-FM (100.3), program director Robert Scorpio said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still playing Kelly's music, but we have debated," Scorpio
said. "If he is guilty, we will probably come out and take a
different stand."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, groups here and nationwide are boycotting the singer's
music.</TE>
<TE>   "It's high time for adults to talk about issues such as these in
our community," said Ken Dunkin, a Democratic candidate for state
representative in Illinois who is co-leading the local boycott. "The
black community is very silent about adults dating young girls. We
don't say anything. We have to start speaking up."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago station WBBM-FM (96.3) has stopped playing tunes from the
new album, though not because of the Kelly sex scandal. Program
director Todd Cavanah said that "Take You Home With Me," from the new
album, failed to stir up excitement among listeners.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Police Department and the Cook County state's
attorney's office refused comment on the allegations other than to
say the matter is under investigation. No charges have been filed
against Kelly, who grew up on the South Side and maintains residences
and studios in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is there is no tape of R. Kelly having sex," said John
Touhy, Kelly's lawyer. "There have been reports in the media of
different tapes, and none of them agrees with the other. If someone
does say there is a tape out there, those claims are
false--absolutely false."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Calls It a 'Smear Campaign'</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has just issued a statement that he is the victim of a
"smear campaign."</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that there are people who want to bring me down," Kelly
said. "Nothing short of stoning would satisfy these people.
Unfortunately, the recent attacks in the media have refused to
discuss the motivations of the individuals engaged in the smear
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Kelly planned to sue any media outlets for libel, Touhy
replied, "We are considering all of our legal options."</TE>
<TE>   There is reportedly a tape of a man urinating and ejaculating on a
girl who looks like a minor. Another tape allegedly shows a man
having sex with at least three girls. The tapes are circulating
around the country and on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations that Kelly engaged in sexual relationships with
underage girls became news after one of the videos was sent
anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in February. Since then, Kelly
has hired Jack Palladino, a private investigator who worked on the
FBI's Abscam probe in 1980. Palladino is investigating who might be
bootlegging the tape and/or who might be behind a campaign to defame
Kelly, Touhy said.</TE>
<TE>   Several publications, including Time, Spin and Vibe magazines, as
well as local TV stations have since reported the allegation that the
man in the tape is Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Even if police conclude that it is Kelly on the tape (or tapes),
it may be months--perhaps years--before charges are filed, if at all.
One reason is that such cases face many legal and investigative
obstacles, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "They have to be able to establish it's really him," said Kimberly
Hart, executive director of the National Child Abuse Defense and
Resource Center in Holland, Ohio. "Then they have to prove she's
underage. Sometimes it's pretty hard to tell. Then you've got the
issue of whether the girl is cooperating with authorities. Any time
the government does not have the [victim] on their side, they've got
a headache."</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at something that's difficult for law enforcement,
in terms of charging a crime," said Jay Howell, a Florida attorney
representing sex abuse victims and a former prosecutor in that state.</TE>
<TE>   "We very much believe there is a person or persons whose
motivation is to destroy his career," Touhy said. "He's devastated by
this whole series of events.... In addition, there's the pain of
knowing that people you formerly trusted are attempting to hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   Requests for an interview with Kelly were declined.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Kelly reached an out-of-court settlement with
former Epic Records intern Tracy Sampson, according to her attorney,
Susan Loggans. Sampson alleged that between May 2000 and March 2001,
Kelly induced Sampson "into an indecent sexual relationship," the
suit stated. Sampson was 17 at the time, the suit said. Because of a
confidentiality agreement, Loggans could not discuss the settlement
between Kelly and Sampson.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Married Aaliyah When She Was 15</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kelly settled another sex-based lawsuit with Tiffany
Hawkins, who was also represented by Loggans. That suit, also settled
out of court, accused Kelly of engaging in a sexual relationship with
Hawkins while she was a minor.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1994, Kelly was briefly married to a minor, Aaliyah
Haughton, who reported her age as 18 on the couple's marriage
certificate. The singer, who died last year in a plane crash, was
just 15 at the time of the marriage, which was annulled a short time
later, according to news reports.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have asked why the state's attorney's office
didn't look into this earlier," Loggans said. "He married Aaliyah and
she was 15 years old. If this was the common man, he'd be in jail
now."</TE>
<TE>   Cook County state's attorney's office spokesman John Gorman said
that Kelly's activities with Aaliyah happened "under a previous
administration" and that the current office would have no idea why
charges were not filed at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Kelly denies any wrongdoing, forces are coalescing that
could threaten the singer's career. A boycott against Kelly that
began two weeks ago spread last week into a boycott against Chicago's
WGCI-FM (107.5). Protest leaders also asked two of the station's
biggest advertisers, Burger King and SBC Ameritech, to stop
advertising. (Burger King representatives did not return phone calls;
an SBC Ameritech spokesman said he was "unaware" of any boycott and
that the company did not plan to pull ads.)</TE>
<TE>   "We've given [WGCI] a week and they've refused" to stop playing
Kelly's music, said the Rev. Bamani Obadele, a community organizer
and co-leader of the boycott. "This issue has gotten out of hand. For
a radio station like GCI to continue to play [his music], it angers
me. That's the bottom line, and I'm going to send a message as a
black father and minister that I won't stand for it."</TE>
<TE>   Marv Dyson, WGCI's president and general manager, said he would
continue to play Kelly's music.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the charges are very severe," he said. "But I'm not
pulling R. Kelly at this point because he's innocent until proven
guilty. I have deep concern for the African American community, but
I'm not going to take R. Kelly records off the radio until he's had
his day in court.... I am just really hell-bent on giving this man
his constitutional rights."</TE>
<TE>   The R. Kelly/Jay-Z single "Get This Money" was WGCI's second most
requested single as of last week and 80% of people e-mailing the
station support Kelly. But if he is found guilty, "I am absolutely
certain it would end [his] career," Dyson said.</TE>

<HD>KNX Never Got Around to Installing That Revolving Door</HD>
<DH>Ed Pyle, a relative newcomer (at 17 years), becomes the
station's fourth news director since 1968, replacing 33-year veteran
Bob Sims.</DH>

<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger managers used to be the paradigm of job continuity, with only
Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda holding that position from 1954 to
1996. But after a few years of upheaval at Chavez Ravine, now KNX-AM
(1070) may be setting the example, as the station has just named a
news director--only its fourth since it went all-news in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Pyle takes over the job from Bob Sims, who is retiring after 33
years at KNX. Pyle, moving up a step from his former position as
executive news producer, is a relative newcomer to the station--he's
only been there 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   "The stability here is amazing," Pyle said. "When you think of the
all-news operations around the country, I don't know if you'll find
any who had a news director that has been there anywhere near 20
years."</LD>
<TE>   He said he hopes to live up to Sims' dual legacies at the station:
the shelves full of industry awards garnered over the years, and the
longevity of the staff, a phenomenon in a business where most resumes
are filled with an alphabet soup of call letters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's remarkable that a guy in this business has been at one
operation for so long," Pyle said of Sims. "And the general manager
has been here longer than any of them. He has great loyalty to his
employees, and they to him."</TE>
<TE>   "I like to think it's me," said general manager George Nicholaw,
laughing. But he credited Sims with creating a nurturing environment
that attracts journalists and keeps them there. "I expect that to
continue under the stewardship of Ed Pyle."</TE>
<TE>   Moving up with Pyle is Ronnie Bradford, KNX news producer since
1982, who takes over Pyle's job as executive news producer.</TE>
<TE>   "We really have a fortunate situation where we segue from one news
director to another news director. It's a very lucky break for me to
be confident to just turn over a news operation," Nicholaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Sims, who could not be reached, had been on family medical leave
for seven months before deciding to retire, Nicholaw said, and Pyle
and Bradford had been filling in during that span. Those promotions
become permanent April 29.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to KNX in 1985, Pyle was news editor and news
director at KFWB-AM (980), the all-news station that, like KNX, is
owned by Infinity Broadcasting. He started as a print reporter,
working on the newspaper at his remote Army base, Ft. Greeley,
Alaska, in 1958. But he became a broadcast journalist when the
soldier operating the base television station asked him to fill in.</TE>
<TE>   "He went on leave and asked if I'd be interested in subbing," Pyle
said. "The guy came back and they reassigned him."</TE>
<TE>   After getting out of the Army, Pyle spent most of the '60s
knocking around radio stations in Florida's Tampa Bay area, where he
grew up.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1967, a number of cities around the country were experiencing
rioting," Pyle said, including Tampa, to a degree. "We had rioting on
a scale that complemented our market size.</TE>
<TE>   "I was marching at the head of a phalanx of National Guardsmen,"
recording the sounds of the unrest and the response, he said, and his
report was distributed by United Press International. An executive at
XTRA Radio News in Tijuana heard it and offered Pyle a job.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me the salary differential. A week or so later I was
headed west. That changed my whole life," Pyle said, for the first
time exposing him to Southern California, and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   It was an auspicious time for radio news in the region. KFWB went
to its all-news format in March 1968, and KNX followed in April, just
after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. And the bombshell
events--particularly in Southern California--did not let up for the
fledgling news operations.</TE>
<TE>   After the King murder and the civil unrest that erupted in some
areas came Robert F. Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles. Then,
Pyle noted, "you had the Manson Family and the moon landing--for
those two news stations, having that kind of news was really a
jump-start."</TE>
<TE>   Bradford was there almost from the beginning, coming to KNX in
June 1968 as a news writer. A Los Angeles native, he had previously
attended USC, served in Vietnam and worked at KABC-AM (790) before
the first news director of the new KNX, Jim Zallian, brought him into
the budding operation.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught us, all young cub reporters, how to be good
journalists," Bradford said, a tradition that followed with the
subsequent news directors, Gregg Peterson and Sims.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford said his defining moment came the night of Jan. 18, 1969.
A United Airlines 727 jet crashed into the ocean about nine miles off
Marina del Rey after takeoff from Los Angeles International Airport,
killing 38 people, and he was one of only three staffers on duty at
KNX.</TE>
<TE>   "In the evening, everybody's gone home and it's just you and a
skeleton staff," Bradford said, remembering how he scrambled to
recall reporters who had gone home. "That was my indoctrination into
breaking news."</TE>
<TE>   But he said he's proudest of the Peabody Award for broadcast
excellence that the station won in 1984, for a series on immigration
that he produced. The station looked at how immigrants were
victimized, and how they affected the area's political, social and
cultural life.</TE>
<TE>   Like many news organizations coping with the economic downturn, he
said KNX has struggled to work through staff reductions, such as
vacancies that don't get filled.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have eight reporters on the street at one time; now we
might have four or five. Some things you just let go," such as chases
or lesser crime news, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we do our best and hope to please our audience," Bradford
said. "We built a reputation, and we'll try to maintain that
reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Pyle said he intends to finish his 30-plus-year career at KNX,
like a ballplayer remaining loyal to a team. And other than switching
its forecast provider to the Weather Channel, and a few other tweaks
he might undertake, Pyle said he foresees no major changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to move fairly slowly," Pyle said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to maintain a quality product, maintain our record of
stability and live up to what we're supposed to do--serve the people
of Southern California. That's what we're licensed to do."</TE>

<HD>'Southern Comfort,' Looking First at the Real Person Within</HD>
<DH>Documentary* Gender identity is treated with compassion in
this HBO presentation of a project that won a top prize at the
Sundance Film Festival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Southern Comfort," a documentary that won the Grand Jury Prize at
the Sundance Film Festival two years ago, opens on Robert, a
craggy-looking middle-aged man with a pipe in his mouth, sitting
behind the wheel of his pickup truck. He lives in a trailer in rural
Alabama. We are introduced to his sons and friends, to their
girlfriends, to his girlfriend.</LD>
<LD>   Then the bottom falls out: Robert is dying of ovarian cancer, and
all but one of these people is transsexual.</LD>
<LD>   Robert's image, and his back story, create a sort of gender
vertigo for viewers during the first 10 minutes or so of the film,
which HBO is showing through the month.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't want to announce that these people were transgender,
because they are people first," says the film's director, Kate Davis,
explaining her mind-reeling approach. "Their gender identity is only
one part of their whole selves ... but gender somehow clouds all of
these other aspects of themselves. It's so all-important to society,
and it's really hard for these people." "Southern Comfort" takes one
of the first things one notices when meeting someone for the first
time--boy or girl--and stands the notion on its head. Before Robert's
gender transition to a male, he was married and gave birth to two
children, but the sons featured most prominently in the film are part
of his adoptive transgender family. His new love, Lola Cola, made a
transition from a man to a woman, which makes their relationship that
of a biological male and a biological female, only the roles are
reversed.</TE>
<TE>   The film deals with the transgender community's own phobias about
entering into a relationship with another transgender person. It also
addresses the audience's natural curiosity about what "transition"
actually means. In Robert's case, he had his breasts removed and took
hormones, but he didn't have what's referred to in the community as
"bottom surgery"--a reconstruction of his genitalia.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all of this seeming weirdness, "Southern Comfort" isn't
some sort of freak show. Robert's plight transcends the gender
confusion and the more general objection, "Why should we care about
this guy?"</TE>
<TE>   Transgender people are one of the few minorities left that can be
safely ridiculed (they are a staple of "The Jerry Springer Show")
and, more significant, discriminated against. Because Robert was a
transsexual, many doctors refused to treat him and several hospitals
declined to admit him for emergency treatment.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, though, the film is ultimately about love and
life rather than something twisted, "unnatural."</TE>
<TE>   Davis met Robert at True Spirit, a female-to-male conference in
Maryland, while she was doing a documentary about transgender people
for A&amp;E. She was struck immediately by his story--"this cowboy with
ovarian cancer and the irony of that"--and by his charisma. She got
up the nerve to call and ask if he would be interested in her making
a film about him and he said yes, because he had nothing to lose and
he hoped that it might make audiences view transgender people
differently.</TE>
<TE>   Time was of the essence because at this point Robert's health was
rapidly declining. So Davis went to Alabama and began shooting with a
digital camera, which was light and small enough to allow her
mobility and a kind of invisibility (at one point Cola turns to the
camera and says without irony that she wishes she could capture this
moment on tape). Davis slept in Robert's trailer, putting herself in
the position on occasion of having to care for him. As she is the
first to admit, she crossed the line--she became his friend, she put
down the camera. This is heresy in documentary circles.</TE>
<TE>   Caretaker First, Filmmaker Second</TE>
<TE>   "Robert would nearly stumble, fall over, drop a drink, get up in
the middle of the night every hour," she says. "It was important for
me to remember first to be a caretaker, second to be a filmmaker. I
think the friendship was critical in terms of the subjects'
willingness to open up, right down to Lola and Robert making out on
the couch. If that closeness is genuine, how could I not extend
myself as a friend or help them? It's much more important than the
film."</TE>
<TE>   This trust was important for other reasons. With the exception of
Cola, who's self-employed, the other characters have a lot to lose,
because the film essentially outs them. According to Cola, they are
"preparing to be fired," including Stephanie, who isn't transgender
but is married to someone who is. This puts Davis squarely on the
spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that it was their decision to begin with," she says. "Had
I tried to convince them, I think I would be saddled with moral doubt
and an uncomfortable weight of responsibility if anything happens to
any of them."</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, by the time documentary first aired on Sunday (it
will next be shown on Saturday), Stephanie was the only one of the
principals employed, and her colleagues didn't seem concerned--if
they saw it. According to Davis and Max, one of Robert's transgender
sons, the response has been largely positive, though Max says that a
former co-worker sent mixed signals. She was confused, unhappy that
he hadn't confided in her and pruriently interested in his genitalia.</TE>
<TE>   Robert's one wish was to live long enough to attend Southern
Comfort, an annual transgender gathering in Atlanta. He does,
delivering a poignant speech and dancing with Cola in an
approximation of the prom he never had.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Davis' feelings for Robert, she couldn't bring herself
to look at what she'd shot until nine months after his death. In the
interim, she cut another documentary, "American Babylon." Then she
went in and edited "Southern Comfort" for five months. The result
landed on the desk of Sheila Nevins, HBO documentary executive vice
president of original programming. Initially, Nevins was reluctant
even to view it--because she thought "it was another one of those
things"--but then relented. What she saw knocked her out.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you care about people you really didn't think you could
care about, and it's a great love story and it makes you understand
the nature of love," Nevins says. "It doesn't have Romeo and Juliet,
but it has, in a way. I can see their faces when they're dancing. I
can see Lola on the bed. I think it's an extraordinary doc, and all I
did was buy it." And submit it to Sundance, where it won the big
prize and wowed audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "It just strikes chords with people," says Cola, who was brought
out after screenings to answer questions from the audience. "There
was a woman who was going to make a comment, and she just broke all
the way down. And then there was this doctor who came up to me after
one screening and he apologized on behalf of the medical profession.
And people who surprise you, like middle-aged couples weeping."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Southern Comfort" will be shown Saturday on HBO at 1 p.m. and
next Friday at 2:30 p.m. Then network has rated it TV-14 (may be
unsuitable for children younger than 14).</TE>

<HD>'Quest' Musicians Supply Interesting Movement</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Brockus Project Dance Company and the Somei Yoshino Taiko
Ensemble got together on the stage of the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood
for the premiere of "Quest" Wednesday night, the most interesting
dance came from the musicians. Odd, but not, unfortunately, entirely
unheard of.</LD>
<LD>   At the start of the 90-minute performance, the four players were
arranged at the edge of the stage, three of them on stools, draped in
long black and white robes, their backs to the audience as their arms
repeatedly swept overhead and paused. Then, they slowly claimed their
drums and built a rhythmic tower of sound. For the several sections
of dance that followed, they provided minimal percussion, faint
vocalizing and the occasional flute tune, both onstage and off. In
two extended musical sections, their dance-like embroidery again rose
to the surface.</LD>
<LD>   Often settling into deep warrior lunges beside the large taiko
drums, they created individual gestural patterns, sometimes leaping
away from a drum, almost seeming to perform an incantation before
returning to the majestic, choreographed reaching that preceded
contact with the drum. One bit of steely frenzy from Jimi Nakagawa
was particularly thrilling, although the ensemble's director Bruce
"Mui" Ghent, Ellen Reiko Bepp and Kallan Yoichi Nashimoto also had
their moments.</LD>
<TE>   The dancers (choreographer Deborah Brockus and five others) seemed
caught in a time warp--somewhere between the naive, amateur
"interpretive dance" of the early or mid-20th century (ponderous
slow-motion and statue poses) and ta-da moments of jazzy flinging.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, not much space was disturbed by the dancers; all
impulses looked surface-deep, tentative, except for flashy brief
solos. Whereas the musicians sliced space and made it tingle. This
revived the idea of a quest, the title concept approached so
flaccidly in the choreography. The drummers channeled energy with
adventurous vigor; they sent it out, welcomed it back, built on it
and made a moving art form in the process.</TE>

<HD>'Guys' Unwisely Gambles on Timing</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest problem with the 50th anniversary production of "Guys and
Dolls" at the Wilshire Theater is.</LD>
<LD>   Timing.</LD>
<LD>   Like a period in the wrong place in a sentence, just about
everything in "Guys and Dolls," starring Maurice Hines as Nathan
Detroit, came about a beat behind schedule at Wednesday's opening
night performance.</LD>
<TE>   This version of the show looks great, with bright, jazzy sets and
delicious candy-box costumes. Costume designer Paul Tazewell adds a
wide palette of rich colors to the usually white-on-black pin-striped
suit always favored by stage gangsters. And scenic designer Norbert
Kolb even makes a scene inside a sewer seem like a visit to some kind
of pastel Oz.</TE>
<TE>   But slow pacing, mostly low-energy music and dance numbers (with
the exception of the sizzling "Havana"), and punch lines consistently
delivered with just enough hesitation to undermine the punch keep
this musical from gaining much momentum. While this version of the
zany story of "the oldest established permanent floating crap game in
New York" has its moments--and a few standout performances, most
notably Alexandra Foucard's Miss Adelaide and Clent Bowers'
Nicely-Nicely Johnson--waiting for them is definitely a crapshoot.</TE>
<TE>   The 1950 Frank Loesser musical, based on Damon Runyon's stories
about New York lowlifes, tells the story of two fast-talking
gamblers, Nathan Detroit and Sky Masterson (Brian Sutherland), their
"dolls" and how their attempt to save the crap game--as well as to
out-gamble each other once and for all--leads them to true love,
kicking and screaming all the way.</TE>
<TE>   They are the 1950s answer to today's Peter Pan male. But the
operative word here is "fast." The humor in this show is more broad
than witty, going for the groan instead of a nod of intellectual
appreciation. You gotta keep this patter moving to make it work; he
who hesitates just isn't funny.</TE>
<TE>   Hines offers a performance that is at once bafflingly muted and
overblown. His Nathan Detroit is unusually soft-spoken, with a
loosey-goosey style of walking and dancing, and a sleepy-eyed stare
that doesn't raise the excitement level. But he is also given to
turning into a mime with exaggerated facial expressions, suddenly
freezing his features in a fish-faced pout or a sheepish grin and
staying that way for a few long seconds while the action stops dead
around him. Once again, it's too much time wasted on too little.</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland has a little more edge--and vocal strength--as Sky
Masterson, tricked on a bet into wooing prim missionary Sarah Brown,
portrayed by his real-life wife, Diane Sutherland.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, there doesn't seem to exist a huge amount of chemistry
between them, but at least they throw themselves into the proceedings
with gusto. Initially guilty of the same sort of tentativeness that
seemed to afflict the whole cast in the first act, Sutherland comes
into her own in the second act, offering a particularly warm and
affecting rendition of the ultimate rationalization duet, "Marry the
Man Today," with Foucard.</TE>
<TE>   Notable in smaller roles are Tad Ingram as the dry-witted Arvide
Abernathy, Curt M. Buckler as the mountainous Big Jule and Donna
Migliaccio as the foursquare Gen. Matilda B. Cartwright of the
missionary band.</TE>
<TE>   The real fun of the show, however, comes from Foucard, a blast of
trashy electricity as the dancer Miss Adelaide, who has spent the
last 14 years engaged to Nathan Detroit and now wants a big rock to
show for it.</TE>
<TE>   With a delightfully weird accent that blends Britain, Brooklyn and
maybe Mars, Foucard is as outrageous as the fashion ensembles that
costumer Tazewell concocts for her, each one a sort of three-ring
circus of bad taste, with hat.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth the wait is big-boned--OK, obese--Bowers as
Nicely-Nicely, as amiably insecure as he is large and possessed of an
equally large voice that's one giant, hilarious whine. He also tears
up "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat"; without him, like most of the
rest of this production, the rousing musical number wouldn't rock but
just drift slowly in the wind.</TE>

<HD>Versatility and More From Young Bassist McBride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christian McBride can play just about anything that one could imagine
on a string bass. Approaching his 30th birthday in May, he already is
a lead-pipe cinch for the jazz hall of fame. That said, he sometimes
can have difficulty finding his musical focus, in part, perhaps,
because he can do so many things so well.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the L.A. Jazz 2002 concert at USC's Bovard
Auditorium, McBride led a first-rate quartet consisting of
saxophonist-flutist Ron Blake, pianist-keyboardist Geoff Keezer and
drummer Terreon Gully in a performance in which the level of
imagination was generally high. Its few less-than-lofty segments
generally traced to McBride's tendency to stitch too many threads
into his creative tapestry.</LD>
<LD>   For example, in addition to his obvious musical talents, he is a
humorist with the sort of easygoing stage manner that allows him to
establish an amiable connection with his listeners. And that was fine
so long as it consisted of casual patter between numbers. But when he
elected at one point to do an impression of Dean Martin complete with
a pre-recorded announcement (and feeble jokes), it was a little hard
to understand what in the world McBride had in mind.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, the balance of the program included well-crafted
playing from the entire group, both individually and collectively. A
solo cadenza by McBride opened the evening with a quick view of the
smooth fluidity he brings to his acoustic bass work. The attractive
program of material included numbers by Steely Dan and Sting--"Aja"
and "Walking on the Moon" (with some fine electric bass work from
McBride)--and a mixed bag of McBride originals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the high points: Gully's drumming on "Egad," Keezer's adroit
movement from acoustic piano to electric piano to synthesizer in
pieces such as "Lullaby for a Ladybug" and "Clerow's Flipped" (a new
McBride work dedicated to comedian Flip Wilson, whose real name was
Clerow), and Blake's performing style, in which he enhanced his
soloing with brisk, rhythmic dancing.</TE>
<TE>   At the point where the evening seemed to be coming to a close,
however, McBride picked up his electric bass and launched into what
he described as a two-song medley of pieces by Jaco Pastorius and Joe
Zawinul. Not a bad idea for a climactic ending, but as it turned out,
it was only the beginning of the ending and the mother of all
medleys, lasting a good 30 minutes and seeming to exist primarily to
prove that McBride is as virtuosic on the electric bass as he is on
the acoustic instrument.</TE>
<TE>   OK, no argument there. But the time might better have been
spent--as were the better segments of the program--illustrating that
McBride also possesses an inventive musicality that is the real
kernel from which his technical virtuosity blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Wayne Shorter Quartet, USC Bovard Auditorium, 3551 Trousdale Parkway,

<HD>Prescient Frank Capra Saved the Black Hats for Media
Tycoons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Frank Capra, who died in 1991, was not known as a futurist,
but he was one.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a Wonderful Life" is his best-known work. Yet in thumbing
through a dandy new book that recalls an area of his moviemaking not
often cited, I've been noting how prophetic he and his writers were
when creating crises and conflicts for their many media characters.</LD>
<LD>   The book is "Frank Capra and the Image of the Journalist in
American Film." On the cover, in the 1934 movie "It Happened One
Night," is Clark Gable as hard-boiled New York Mail reporter Pete
Warne ("Hey, listen, monkey face; when you fired me, you fired the
best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had"). Yeah, that's the
way we all talk.</LD>
<TE>   The author is Joe Saltzman, a first-rate news documentarian and a
professor and associate dean in USC's Annenberg School for
Communication.</TE>
<TE>   Although his focus is Capra's screen work, Saltzman at one point
widens his commentary to images of journalists in all movies,
including a category of jerk with whom some of you may be familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "Critics," writes Saltzman about movie portrayals of these
heartless newspaper cads, "often write columns as well as reviews,
and many are cold-blooded, unscrupulous journalists who use their
power to get what they want when they want it and collect their pound
of flesh whenever they feel like it."</TE>
<TE>   And that's bad?</TE>
<TE>   The drama critic in Capra's 1944 adaptation of "Arsenic and Old
Lace" would be insufferable "if he wasn't played so ingratiatingly by
Cary Grant," notes Saltzman in his book (which can be purchased
through the Web site www.ijpc .org).</TE>
<TE>   But no Capra journalists are gleaming heroes, which Saltzman
believes may be a genesis of today's broad mistrust of media. It's
not such a wonderful life for his newshounds. They're flawed, from
Stew Smith (Robert Williams), who drinks too much in "Platinum
Blonde" (1931), to Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell), who drinks too much
in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939), to columnist Ann Mitchell
(Barbara Stanwyck), who doesn't drink too much in "Meet John Doe"
(1941). All she does is fabricate a story.</TE>
<TE>   "Capra's editors and reporters may do terrible things, but they're
really nice guys," Saltzman said this week. The Big Nasties lurk
elsewhere. One reason Saltzman chose Capra as a subject "was that he
was so ahead of his time in realizing who the real villains of
journalism were." And? "All of the vicious villains in Capra films
were tycoons," Saltzman said. "What Capra and Robert Riskin [the
writer who was his primary collaborator] predicted is how the media
would be controlled by them."</TE>
<TE>   He's speaking now of today's sprawling archipelagos of media
interests. The gargantuan ones are AOL Time Warner, Viacom Inc., Walt
Disney Co. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., each having potential,
through their splayed radii of communications, to manipulate the
information we receive and control what we think and think about. On
a smaller scale, but right there with them, is this paper's
media-conglomerate owner, Tribune Co.</TE>
<TE>   As media critic Mark Crispin Miller has written:</TE>
<TE>   "The true cause of the enormous ills that now dismay so many
Americans--the universal sleaze and 'dumbing down,' the flood-tide of
corporate propaganda, the terminal insanity of United States
politics--has risen not from any grand decline in national character
... but from the inevitable toxic influence of those few corporations
that have monopolized our culture."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking as a monopolizer, I plead guilty. Even if Miller is
overstating a bit, though, the trend of growing influence by a few
corporations--that own movies, book publishing, magazines,
newspapers, over-the-air television, cable and you name it--is
extremely troubling.</TE>
<TE>   What would Capra do about it if he were making movies today? "He'd
go after AOL Time Warner, Disney and all the rest," Saltzman said.
"He'd probably make a movie with a TV reporter, someone at a local
station, showing how people there were fighting against a takeover."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Capra opposed centering media control in fewer and
fewer hands, which at once widens the reach of the messenger and
narrows and homogenizes the message. "That attitude was a key part of
his thinking in the '30s and '40s," Saltzman said. "He was afraid of
this control of the media."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the vast bulk of Capra's films were made before the TV
era, and his journalists largely mirrored newspaper cliches of the
time, their reflections of expanding power in media boardrooms apply
more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Released in 1948 and based on a stage play, for example, "State of
the Union" has Spencer Tracy as a presidential candidate who makes
compromises and alters his values to accommodate the ambitions of a
ruthless newspaper publisher (Angela Lansbury) and political boss
(Adolphe Menjou).</TE>
<TE>   Saltzman finds the 1941 tycoon in "Meet John Doe" even more
wicked. Facing dismissal from her job, it's Stanwyck's Mitchell who
does the unthinkable by inventing in her newspaper column a letter
from a John Doe who vows to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to
protest the misery, corruption and hypocrisy suffocating him. It's
despotic new publisher D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold), however, who is
Capra's epic scoundrel here, because Mitchell would not be writing
her dishonest column of protest had he not bought the paper and given
her and her colleagues pink slips in pursuit of his dream: a fascist
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   It's not fascism that dominates today's headlines. If Capra were
alive and active today, would he want to make a movie showing
reporters covering combat in Afghanistan or the Middle East instead
of filming their combat with editors and moguls? Only one Capra film,
"Here Comes the Groom" in 1951, includes a foreign correspondent
(played by, uh, Bing Crosby). "He stayed away from foreign
correspondents," Saltzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Capra quit Hollywood during World War II and made seven
documentaries for the War Department. So Saltzman thinks Capra would
now be offering his services to the government, this time to again
make documentaries "about why we fight."</TE>
<TE>   Not only terrorism, but the narrowing of media diversity.</TE>

<HD>'Murder by Numbers' Plays Like a Twin Bill of Thrillers</HD>
<DH>Sandra Bullock is a tough cop in this film, in which the
relationship between the killers develops as the most interesting
aspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of "Murder by Numbers" as a classic 1940s double bill uneasily
contained within the confines of a single motion picture.</LD>
<LD>   The A-picture at the top of the bill is a fairly standard star
vehicle like those that used to be specially tailored for Joan
Crawford or Barbara Stanwyck. This one features established diva
Sandra Bullock as Cassie Mayweather, a sharp-tongued "get the hell
out of my crime scene" type of homicide detective who has to solve
the toughest case of her career.</LD>
<LD>   The B-picture at the bottom of the bill is an intriguing study in
aberrant psychology that stars hot young actors Ryan Gosling and
Michael Pitt as two high school thrill killers who commit a murder to
see if they can get away with it and thus prove their superiority to
the common herd.</LD>
<TE>   Inspired by 1924's notorious Leopold and Loeb case, this kind of
story is also familiar, having been touched on before in films like
"Compulsion," Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" and "Swoon." But because
director Barbet Schroeder has a documented affinity for the dark
side, this part of "Murder by Numbers" is much more involving than
it's A-picture counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   As written by Tony Gayton, "Murder by Numbers" is no whodunit--we
know at once that the boys committed the crime in question--but
rather follows a catch-us-if-you-can scenario as the lads match wits
with the intrepid detective.</TE>
<TE>   A crime-scene specialist and a pillar of the police force of the
California coastal town of San Benito (modeled after San Luis
Obispo), Mayweather is introduced while breaking in a new partner,
Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin, serviceable as always).</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather, as it turns out, has had lots of new partners. She's a
tough, take-charge cop, tough on personal and professional
relationships and nicknamed "the Hyena" around the force. Plus, she
just happens to have something in her past that gets her in over her
head emotionally in her newest case, which involves the seemingly
random murder of an innocent young girl.</TE>
<TE>   Though much may be made of this being a darker role for Bullock,
the police story is very much the more standard aspect of "Murder by
Numbers," and the actress being an executive producer assured that
this part of the film would be carefully tailored to her
specifications..</TE>
<TE>   When we first meet Richard Haywood (Gosling, who broke through as
the title character in Henry Bean's "The Believer") and Justin
Pendleton (Michael Pitt), they look and act so stereotypical--Richard
the smirky, arrogant rich kid, Justin the ultimate genius
misfit--that the fear is that this part of the film will be standard
as well.</TE>
<TE>   But this doesn't happen. As they hang out together after school at
a deserted house on a bluff, drinking absinthe, talking about how
living fully means embracing crime and exulting that "there are no
limits for men like us," an involving dynamic is visible. And as they
spar over the affections of classmate Lisa (Agnes Bruckner, excellent
in the Sundance hit "Blue Car"), the kind of twisted feeling they
have for each other emerges in an increasingly intriguing way.</TE>
<TE>   Partially this is due to the energy and skill of the actors and
partially to a script that gradually reveals how elaborately planned
the crime was and takes pleasure in delineating the cat-and-mouse
games between the two boys, determined to prove that they know what
the police are thinking before they think it, and detective
Mayweather, who starts with just the merest hunch that there is more
going on with these kids than it might appear.</TE>
<TE>   Also a key player is Schroeder, one of the most interesting
directors working in the studio system, able to go back and forth
between smaller, darker independent items such as "Maitresse,"
"Barfly" and "Our Lady of the Assassins," and more polished
mainstream films such as "Reversal of Fortune," "Single White Female"
and this one. Though he makes you squirm more than you want to at the
inevitable scenes of the trussed-up female murder victim, he also has
the proclivity and the skill to make at least the B-picture half of
"Murder by Numbers" of more than passing interest.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence, language, a sex scene and brief drug
use. Times guidelines: disturbing murder scenes and graphic violence.</TE>

<HD>'Numbers' Joins List of Dramas Based on Loeb-Leopold Murder
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grisly plot of the new Sandra Bullock film "Murder by Numbers" is
torn from the pages of both American and cinema history.</LD>
<LD>   Two brilliant but twisted teenage boys, played by Ryan Gosling and
Michael Pitt, commit the "perfect murder." Then, to prove their
mental superiority, they play cat-and-mouse games with the police.</LD>
<LD>   The movie puts a contemporary twist on a crime that resulted in an
early "trial of the century"--the infamous 1924 case revolving around
wealthy Chicago teenagers Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, who
murdered Bobby Franks, a 13-year-old from a prominent family, just
for the thrill.</LD>
<TE>   The crime captured the attention of the world during the Roaring
'20s. The driving force of the pair, Loeb was the 18-year-old son of
a retired Sears Roebuck vice president. He was obsessed with crime.
The youngest graduate ever of the University of Michigan, he read
crime novels, planned crimes and committed them. He wanted to commit
the perfect murder just to prove it could be done.</TE>
<TE>   Leopold, 19, was the son of a box manufacturer and was interested
in ornithology and philosophy. He had a stormy relationship with
Loeb. But despite their arguments, Loeb had a firm hold over Leopold.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924, Leopold was a student at the University of Chicago and
was scheduled to attend Harvard Law School that fall. At the time of
the murder, he was already the nation's leading authority on the
Kirtland warbler, an endangered songbird. Leopold was also an
advocate of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, especially his criticism
of moral codes.</TE>
<TE>   Before "Murder by Numbers," the Leopold and Loeb case had been the
subjects of plays, novels and movies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1929, British writer Patrick Hamilton ("Gaslight") penned the
play "Rope," about two Oxford undergraduates who kill a third boy.
Hamilton, though, denied the Leopold-Loeb case inspired his play.
Alfred Hitchcock was interested in transforming the play into a movie
and finally brought the story to the big screen in 1948. "Rope" was
Hitchcock's first film in Technicolor and is best known for being
shot in continuous eight-minute takes.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock turned "Rope" back into an American story. Farley
Granger and John Dall play two brilliant young men who strangle a
friend with a rope and then stuff him into a big wooden chest. For a
thrill, they then invite friends and family over for a party.
Throughout the party, the chest remains in the living room. One of
the guests, the boys' former headmaster (James Stewart), outwits his
former charges and guesses their crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Compulsion" also was a fictionalized version of the Leopold and
Loeb case. Meyer Levin wrote the best-selling novel in 1956.
"Compulsion" became a Broadway play the next year and a film in 1959.
In this film version, Dean Stockwell played the Leopold character,
renamed Judd Steiner, and Bradford Dillman was Loeb's alter ego,
Artie Strauss. Orson Welles played the defense attorney Jonathan
Wilk.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Richard Fleischer, the film received generally
positive reviews and was a modest box office success. Leopold,
though, said that reading the book made him "physically sick" and
made him feel "terrific shame." He also was angered because he felt
the book depicted the murder in sexual terms. He ended up filing a
suit against the producers of the film, but it was dismissed 11 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   "Swoon," released in 1992, examined the Leopold and Loeb case from
a homoerotic point of view. Daniel Schlachet and Craig Chester play
the infamous killers in this low-budget, black-and-white independent
production directed by Tom Kalin.</TE>

<HD>Visions of Heaven and Earth From the Rev. Ethan Acres</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Ethan Acres doesn't care if it rains or freezes, as long
he's got a plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard of his car. Or, in
the case of his provocative new exhibition of sculpture at Patricia
Faure Gallery, a silver-painted fiberglass Jesus, who sports a
flaming red Sacred Heart and rides the green hood of a Cadillac like
a surfboard out on the gallery's patio. (Don't miss the evangelical
fish decals attached to each side of the hood.) "Sweet Chariot," as
the outdoor work is titled, swings low.</LD>
<LD>   In "Virgin of the Hood," a baby blue Virgin of Guadalupe is
affixed to a wall-mounted, flame-licked baby blue Cadillac hood.
"RapTure" sends a winged and gilded gerbil heavenward from its
earthly cage, where its going-nowhere exercise wheel stands notably
idle. "Donny &amp; Marie" blends the pop duo into a single two-headed ice
skater--shades of Salt Lake City--made from crocheted yarn; he-she
executes a figure-eight, symbol of eternal life, and invokes an
apocryphal text about how the union of male and female will open the
door to the kingdom of heaven.</LD>
<TE>   Acres is a practicing minister, as well as an artist. The musical
allusions in his new work--country music, Virgin Records, urban rap,
pre-teen pop--link an aural form of celebration, familiar to
Protestant liturgy, with visual art, which is mostly alien to that
tradition. The unexpected union is what gives Acres' work its punch.
It crystallizes in a startling, four-part, hand-crocheted wall piece
in which Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and the other members of the
heavy-metal band KISS undergo suitably satanic transformations.
Simmons' body, for example, morphs into an apple-wielding serpent,
which seems appropriate for a fellow with such a notorious flicking
tongue.</TE>
<TE>   The multi-genre musical ensemble ignites a "Dancing Jesus" and
"Dancing Satan" at opposite ends of the main gallery. These two
monumental figures, each 11 feet tall, are made from the cylindrical
advertising balloons attached to motorized blower-fans that you might
find gesticulating wildly at a used-car lot. (Satan gets down in a
funkier mode than the relatively wooden carpenter does.) Acres'
estimable work is selling joyfulness and exultation amid our veil of
tears, and established pop practice offers a proven method.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial culture and religion usually do not fare too well in
today's art world. More common are repulsive projects like "The Holy
Artwork," on view in Manhattan's current Whitney Biennial, in which
Berlin artist Christian Jankowski videotaped a spontaneous sermon by
a San Antonio televangelist on the biblical meaning of creativity.
Sophisticated audiences at the Upper Eastside art museum get to
snicker at the rubes.</TE>
<TE>   Acres' art is certainly funny, but it's also without irony. The
result makes its generous invocation of faith both radical and, to
some, downright incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Faure Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave.,
(310) 449-1479, through May 11. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Animated Sculpture Has the Last Laugh</TE>
<TE>   As self-portraits go, a new animated sculpture by Daniel J.
Martinez is altogether unique. Savvy in its take on a dilemma of art
today, shameless in its self-indulgent posing and careful in its
theatrical craftsmanship, the sculpture, titled "happiness is
over-rated", is not easily forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   At the Project, Martinez has built a pure white room that
functions as an integral element of the figurative sculpture
contained within. The figure, dressed in blue workman's clothes,
kneels in a corner with its back to the entrance. Made from silicon
over fiberglass it's stunningly lifelike, in the manner of trompe
l'oeil sculptures by Duane Hansen or John D'Andrea, right down to the
blue veins glimpsed beneath translucent skin and the two-day stubble
on the chin. Unlike theirs, though, this animated sculpture invokes
the entertaining "audio-animatrons" at Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   With the hiss of pneumatically driven air, the kneeling worker
raises first one hand, then the other, bringing each in turn down
across the opposite wrist. Razorblades are clutched in each hand, in
a ritual act of mock-suicide. The head tilts back, the mouth falls
open and Grand Guignol laughter echoes through the white-cube
chamber. It's over in less than a minute--then starts again.</TE>
<TE>   The artist as a worker who ritualistically drains his lifeblood
for the amusement of the gallery audience is a staple of Modern art.
(Think of Antonin Artaud or the peintres maudits--cursed
artists--like Amedeo Modigliani.) Here, the visual kick comes from
the sharp disjunction between the incredible simulation of the figure
and its herky-jerky mechanism, which makes fun of special effects.
There's a bracingly manic, obsessive quality to this otherwise
earnest sculpture, which is pointedly adrift in its idealized white
space.</TE>
<TE>   The Project, 962 E. 4th St., (213) 620-0692, through May 18.
Closed Sunday through Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Sillman Celebrates Struggle and Wonder</TE>
<TE>   Amy Sillman draws with paint, often on rough pastel fields of
color laid on the canvas (or sometimes board) in coarse, thinly
painted but heavily worked layers. The figurative drawings are shaggy
and can be difficult to read.</TE>
<TE>   Are those tall, skinny red lines a pair of legs rising into a
cloud, like a kid's-eye view of an adult? Is that a thought balloon
emerging from the profile of a woman? What are those odd creatures
amid the people lined up in a queue? Sillman's images aren't
declarative; instead they have the chewed-over look of ruminations.</TE>
<TE>   At Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, the Brooklyn artist's
first area solo exhibition brings together 10 paintings notable for
their dreamy insouciance. Blots of smeared color assert themselves as
equal in stature and significance to recognizable objects. Episodes
of violence look cartoonish--intense, impermanent and unreal. The
occasional animal--a bright-eyed fox, a bemused bird--adds the
quality of a fable. Sillman's tableaux seem ripe with narrative
possibilities as yet unspoken.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most charming paintings are also the
smallest--unframed canvases barely a foot on a side. A curled-up
creature floats in a pea-green sea beneath a blue sailboat; a
reclining boy appears to be held down by the weight of a giant head;
a figure lies crumpled in a heap, as if the air had been let out of
his body. Struggle and wonder go together in these works, in both the
imagery and the way the paintings are made. It makes for a potent
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, 5363 Wilshire Blvd.,
(323) 933-2117, through April 20. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<TE>   Theatrical Views of George Mallory</TE>
<TE>   With just the sparest of sculptural materials, Carmine Iannaccone
manages to evoke a sense of emptiness, precarious instability and
dead weight in his small solo exhibition at Post. Inspired by
photographs of the frozen body of mountain climber George Mallory,
who famously perished during an attempt to conquer Mt. Everest 78
years ago, Iannaccone's three sculptures are theatrical abstractions.
They lodge themselves between ethereal remoteness and insistent
physical presence.</TE>
<TE>   The most convincing is "Mallory's Shoulder," a tall white wall
with a notch cut from the top left corner. Set a foot or so in front
of the white gallery wall, like a stage set, this second wall
supports a chunky block of rough-hewn, partially painted Douglas fir.
The shape of the carved block, which is balanced in the notch, evokes
a mountain range. It's both far away and tangible, simultaneously an
image and an object. This odd duality extends as well to the
stage-set wall.</TE>
<TE>   Iannaccone does less well with a heavily framed drawing in magenta
acrylic and black ink, which describes a celestial phenomenon (like
an aurora borealis) above a striated sea. By contrast, the sculptures
take advantage of a physical inertia that gives their subtle
pictorial allusions a commanding heft.</TE>
<TE>   Post, 1904 E. 7th Place, downtown L.A., (213) 622-8580, through
May 13. Closed Sunday through Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>An Intriguing Marriage of Choreography and Camera</HD>
<DH>Getty festival offers a conservative but appealing
selection of shorts with a few resourceful standouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever the film crowd may want from a dance-for-camera event, the
dance fan seeks the same choreographic distinction and dancer quality
found in the best stage performances, PBS "Dance in America"
telecasts or feature films. Happily, in two programs a week apart,
the Getty Center's Dance Camera West film and video festival has
offered audiences a number of major examples as part of an appealing
if largely conservative showcase of 14 short pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Concluding tonight, the festival traces a range from
not-quite-dance (Victoria Marks and Margaret Williams' documentary
abstraction "Men," which was screened on the festival's first
program, last Friday) to tonight's not-quite-cinema (Lynette Kessler
and Douglas Thompson's souped up performance tape "Anima"). It is
arguably overloaded with dance-on-the-rocks: dancers photographed
amid picturesque mountain vistas. Moreover, there may be far too
little of the new technologies that are transforming the field.</LD>
<LD>   But who could complain about "Queens for a Day," a freewheeling
1996 Swiss entry (on program two) directed by Pascal Magnin, with
choreography by Marie Nespolo and Christine Kung? This improbable
union of take-no-prisoners postmodernism, animal motion, folk dancing
and ancient myth needs every inch of the Alps to hold its
life-affirming energy. Filmic space is its natural habitat.</LD>
<TE>   Magnin has another resourcefully directed film screening tonight,
the urban "Contrecoup" from 1997, but Guilherme Botelho's
choreography about hopelessly angry and needy young people proves so
derivative of Anglo-European stage achievements (most notably by Pina
Bausch and DV8 Physical Theatre) that even its intense performances
can't save it from looking generic.</TE>
<TE>   Another entry tonight, Allen Kaeja and Mark Adam's elegiac 1997
"Witnessed," also looks warmed over both in its familiar approaches
to location shooting and choreography. However, the very notion of
using a Holocaust site as a dance environment sustains it through its
five minutes on screen. Among comic entries, Mitchell Rose's 2000
"Modern Daydreams," screened last week, earns pride of place for
avoiding farcical overkill and finding unusual spatial contexts for
the choreography by Jamey Hampton and Ashley Roland. A sad love duet
for man and bulldozer, set to the same music as "The Dying Swan," is
but one of its inspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Editing takes the reins in three works on tonight's program, Hans
Beenhaaker's 2001 "Wiped," Michael Downing's 1997 "Cornered," and
"Rest in Piece," a 2001 dance skit credited to director Annick Vroom
and the Hans Hof Ensemble. Many of the participants in those films
are talented, but their dancing is seldom allowed a life of its own
and the collage of shots has few rewards for those interested in
choreography or performance.</TE>
<TE>   For depth of feeling, photographic sensitivity and movement
invention, the central (duet) portion of Laura Taler's 1995 "A
Village Trilogy" may be the most memorable footage in the festival.
Shot in black-and-white, the varied forest textures here add
immeasurably to a vision of quirky brotherhood explored through a
rich character-dance vocabulary and fine portrayals.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Part 1 (a crazed solo) needs a stronger dancer and
the incessant camera motion in Part 3 (a celebratory ensemble) often
makes the dancing unreadable. Taler emerges as the big Dance Camera
West discovery. "Trilogy" appeared only on the first program at the
Getty, but her charming 2000 introduction to abstract dance, "A Very
Dangerous Pastime," which opened last week's program and does the
same tonight, again shows that her mastery of choreography and
direction is unquestioned.</TE>
<TE>   Not so the central "Pastime" thesis about how people are
intimidated by experimental dance. Some of us would bet that there
are probably more people intimidated by experimental film, and that
dance-for-camera needs apologists far less than filmmakers willing to
trust a choreographic vision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "Dance Camera West Festival" concludes tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
the Harold M. Williams Auditorium at the Getty Center, 1200 Getty
Center Drive, L.A. Free; parking reservations required. (310)
440-7300.</TE>

<LD>   Farrow Nixes Footage</LD>
<LD>   in Woody Allen Show</LD>
<TE>   A promotional tape for Turner Classic Movies' "Woody Allen: A Life
in Film," due to be shown on May 4, contains clips from several of
the director's movies starring former love Mia Farrow. That footage
is being eliminated from the final cut, however--at the insistence of
the actress.</TE>
<TE>   According to an agreement with the Screen Actors Guild, producers
must clear all clips not only with the copyright holders but also
with the performers who appear in them. And Farrow, it seems, is
still miffed over her 1992 acrimonious split from Allen, who left her
to marry her 21-year-old adopted daughter Soon-Yi.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, her agent denied permission to use any Farrow footage,
suggesting that film historian Richard Schickel--who produced, wrote
and directed the 90-minute project--put through a call to her client.
During a half-hour conversation with Farrow, Schickel told The Times,
she called the show a "celebration" of Allen's work. No, he
countered: "It's an 'explanation.'"</TE>
<TE>   Farrow, who appeared in such Allen films as "Hannah and Her
Sisters " and "The Purple Rose of Cairo," was one of Allen's
primarily leading ladies, along with ex-wife Louise Lasser and
longtime girlfriend Diane Keaton. Still, Schickel denies that
removing the material left a gaping hole.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a little disappointing, but never fatal," said the
critic, who interviewed Allen for the program for 41/2 hours last
October. "This isn't 'Woody's Greatest Hits,' but an examination of
why he started making films and the themes he developed. Other
material covered the same ground [as the clips of Farrow]."</TE>

<TE>   TV Academy Supports 'Readable Credits'</TE>
<TE>   Responding to reports that the Discovery Networks is planning to
eliminate on-screen credits from the end of its programs, the Academy
of Television Arts &amp; Sciences has taken the unprecedented step of
passing a resolution affirming its support for "readable credits"
within programs.</TE>
<TE>   The organization, which presents the Emmy Awards, rejected the
idea of steering viewers to a Web site where they could find complete
credits, one alternative that Discovery has proposed in meetings with
producers. The group's board voted on the resolution at its monthly
meeting Wednesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, unions representing actors, directors, writers,
photographers and editors converged to discuss a campaign against the
move. Michael Donaldson, president of the International Documentary
Assn., presided over the meeting. "There has been a credit erosion
over the past decade, reducing them from 90 seconds to 30 seconds,"
Donaldson told The Times. "And often they're squeezed on the side,
sharing the screen with promos. Taking them off the screen altogether
is devastating for the creative community because credits are how
careers are built in this town."</TE>

<HD>How Do You Say 'Breakout'?</HD>
<DH>Movies* Universal themes and strategic marketing turn 'Y Tu
Mama' and 'Monsoon Wedding' into rare foreign-language hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day Bob Berney got an early-morning phone call from his mother in
Oklahoma City, he knew the movie his company--IFC Films--had
released, "Y Tu Mama Tambien," was something of a phenomenon.</LD>
<LD>   Last Sunday, the Daily Oklahoman ran a story on the front of its
entertainment section featuring "Tu Mama," a sexually explicit,
Spanish-language, Mexican teenage-coming-of-age-movie--not the
typical kind of entertainment Oklahomans are accustomed to reading
about in their paper. This kind of attention was even more surprising
considering the film had not even been released yet in Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   "IFC films don't usually play Oklahoma City--ever," said Berney,
IFC's senior vice president of marketing and distribution. He was
referring to his distribution company's penchant for picking
non-mainstream fare.</LD>
<TE>   But director Alfonso Cuaron's "Tu Mama" seems to have broken
through several obstacles--it has grossed more than $5 million
domestically in a month's limited release, making it one of the more
successful foreign films in years. Berney is expecting "Tu Mama" to
gross about $12 million in its theatrical run.</TE>
<TE>   It's one of two breakout foreign films in release in the U.S.
"Monsoon Wedding," Mira Nair's funny and poignant portrait of
contemporary family life in New Delhi, has grossed more than $6
million in two months and is expected to earn more than $10 million,
making it the highest-grossing Indian film ever released in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Both films go wider today with "Tu Mama" jumping from 194 screens
to 240; it will likely expand to 300 screens a week later. (Berney
hopes the film will open in Oklahoma City then, so his relatives can
see it). USA's "Monsoon Wedding" goes from 162 screens to 187 today.</TE>
<TE>   Both films have benefited from specific marketing campaigns
focusing on the art-house crowd, but also their respective ethnic
communities.</TE>
<TE>   These successes show how foreign-language films with universal
themes can find an audience despite the challenges of today's movie
business, in which finding a screen for art-house fare--especially in
another language--is increasingly difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "In many cases, language is a major barrier," said Gitesh Pandya,
editor of boxofficeguru.com, a service that tracks box office
grosses. He was also hired to help with "Monsoon Wedding's" marketing
strategy. "In many cases, mainstream moviegoers don't want to deal
with subtitles or dubbing. Distributors and exhibitors both want to
minimize risk, and so they might be a little hesitant on booking
those films."</TE>
<TE>   The success of both films is unusual in other ways. "Tu Mama" has
pushed beyond its art-house audience despite the fact that it was
released unrated because of its explicit nature. "It's fairly unusual
for a Spanish-language unrated film to do this kind of business,"
Berney said.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Foley, head of marketing and distribution for USA Films,
which distributed "Monsoon Wedding," noted that "Hindi-language films
or Tibetan films just don't have the same [appeal] as French, Spanish
or Italian because they are not as common. It is a culture that I
think is difficult for some in the West to get their hands around.
['Monsoon Wedding'] overcame those issues."</TE>
<TE>   Neither film will come close to the blockbuster success of Sony
Pictures Classics' martial-arts romance "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon," a 2000 film that made more than $120 million in its domestic
theatrical release alone. Miramax's "Life Is Beautiful," is ranked
second in grosses for foreign-language films, pulling in $57 million
domestically in 1998. The highest-grossing Mexican film was Miramax's
"Like Water for Chocolate," in 1993 making more than $21 million in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But what sets "Tu Mama" apart from those films is its sexual
content. It is so explicit that rather than make cuts in the film or
receive an NC-17 rating. Cuaron and IFC decided to go out with an
unrated version of the film. It is much harder for an unrated film to
get broad national exhibition, said Ray Price, head of marketing for
Landmark Theatres, a major national art-house chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Some circuits just won't show unrated films," Price said. "They
are very conservative."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, "Tu Mama" has managed to tap into several audiences
at once--the art-house/foreign film crowd, the Latino market and the
mainstream mall crowd. Getting all of those audiences to view one
film is challenging.</TE>
<TE>   IFC and USA have done what is called a platform release, in which
a film is rolled out slowly to test the waters. Through strong
reviews and word-of-mouth, the movies have peaked the art-house
crowd's interest. In the case of "Tu Mama," IFC marketed the film
heavily on Spanish-language television, where they have tapped into
Spanish-speaking older generations and bilingual younger audiences
who are hearing about the film in both the Spanish- and
English-language media. The company has spent about $3 million on
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   USA has also spent a couple of million marketing its film in the
Indian and South Asian communities in large cities like L.A., Chicago
and New York. Although its film has not crossed over into the
mainstream, it is holding steady on the art-house circuit. Because
English is an official language in India, most of the niche marketing
was done in English in newspapers, radio and television shows with
high South Asian demographics. Pandya, who was hired to formulate USA
Films' strategy with the South Asian community, said he targeted the
younger, more Americanized South Asians through the underground club
scene, hiring DJs to host dance parties with "Monsoon Wedding" as the
theme.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen if the films will survive the blockbuster
summer season. The competition for screens is already beginning, with
movies like Universal's "The Scorpion King" opening today on more
than 3,000 screens and Sony's "Spider-Man" opening in two weeks.
Berney is hoping the movies will live on as counter programming for
people who want to see something other than a big studio production.</TE>
<TE>   "The big blockbusters will have an impact on everything," Pandya
added. "But with smaller ethnic films like these, there is a
clear-cut audience that when the word-of-mouth reaches them, they
have got their mind-set and they will go see that movie--the will
make the time."</TE>

<HD>'New Works' Show Reopens the Pasadena Armory</HD>
<DH>Exhibits that reach from under the floor to the skylights
reflect the diversity of expression made possible in the refurbished
galleries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine months ago, Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts closed its
doors to the public. As the building was being renovated, 11 artists
were commissioned to create works for its new-and-improved galleries.
Last weekend, the art center reopened with "New Works, New Spaces," a
hodgepodge of sculptural installations highlighting the architectural
features of a redesigned interior that integrates classrooms,
studios, offices and galleries in a dynamically balanced whole.</LD>
<LD>   The least interesting pieces illustrate the obvious. Atop the two
skylights in the curved roof, Jane Mulfinger has laid out two rows of
secondhand clothing, one blue, the other red. Although her
installation calls attention to the skylights, it prevents them from
doing their job: bathing the other works in Southern California
sunshine.</LD>
<LD>   Tamara Fites has transformed a narrow back gallery (which was once
the National Guard's ammunition vault) into what appears to be a
storage room for the leftovers from numerous yard sales. The
tarnished household items that fill Fites' floor-to-ceiling racks are
props from her previous performances that visitors are invited to
take with them. Not only is it difficult to imagine anyone wanting
any of this musty stuff, it's simple-minded to think that the most
interesting things viewers take away from an exhibition can be
carried in their hands.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than messing with the form and function of their
surroundings, Lisa Yu's 23 ceramic vessels and Marsia
Alexander-Clarke's 12-monitor video-installation complement the
spaces they were made for. Glazed white, Yu's 3-foot-tall urns line
the walls of a square, ceiling-less gallery. Shrouded in the darkness
of a fully enclosed gallery, Alexander-Clarke's piece blocks out the
competition in order to draw you into its repetitious rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Although both works offer conventional interludes from the chaos
of everyday life, they have the presence of classroom demonstrations,
directed exercises whose primary purpose is to emphasize the
adaptability of the Armory's new spaces. All but one of the remaining
pieces take the form of networks, clusters of interconnected
components to which additional elements may be logically and
imaginatively added, as time and space allow.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Lynn Aldrich has bundled together hundreds of
6-foot-long garden hoses and PVC pipes, forming what appears to be a
single cross-section of an enormous circulatory system. There's
nothing in her work's form or materials that requires her to stop
where she has, in either size or number. Such arbitrariness is
dissatisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Geoff Allen's sculptural relief, which sprawls across
20 feet of the wall and towers 12 feet overhead, is made of dozens of
lacy, pretzel-shaped spills of high-end plaster mixed with gypsum.
Adorned with cartoon eyeballs and the textures of prefabricated parts
for dollhouses and model dioramas, each fragile, pastel-tinted cast
is a universe unto itself. Big simply because it can be, Allen's
painterly abstraction is unnecessarily repetitive.</TE>
<TE>   Size does not detract from Enrique Martinez Celaya's sculpture of
an enormous elk sitting on its haunches on the gallery floor before a
boy who stands with bowed head. Tarred and feathered, the life-size
figures are linked by their predicament, which elicits both sympathy
and humor. But Celaya spoils the simplicity of his piece by including
four huge photographs of the boy and the elk in various settings.
Conceptually, this transforms his free-standing sculpture into a bona
fide installation. It also supplies souvenirs for collectors without
the space or budgets for such large, institution-friendly sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   Where Celaya's sculpture gets dressed up in artsy packaging,
Deborah Aschheim's 3-D model of the rods, cones and nerves of a human
eyeball gets bogged down in realism. The more her 40-foot-long
sculptural transformation of a textbook diagram departs from its
source, the more it inspires leaps of the imagination. Changing
colors faster than a sunset but slower than a flashing neon sign,
Aschheim's homemade electric eye resembles a school of mutant
jellyfish swimming amid a cluster of WWII torpedoes, all adrift in a
fantastic galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Michael C. McMillen's "Motel (Under the World)" is made with
children in mind. Set beneath a thick sheet of safety glass in the
entryway's floor, his life-size diorama features a rusty robot
drinking motor oil as he watches home movies in a room cluttered with
junk. Like a Cold War survivalist holed up in a backyard bunker,
McMillen's mechanical man contrasts dramatically with the other
works' embrace of expandable interactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Roden and Pae White take this attitude into the realm of
functional objects. Strung from the branches of two trees outside the
building's front door, Roden's audio speakers play a chiming melody
that blends with the sounds of the street. Just inside the gallery's
entrance, White's 14 candy-colored seats also verge on disappearing
into their surroundings. You could rest on their vinyl-covered
cushions and admire their curvaceous forms without knowing an artist
made them.</TE>
<TE>   The set includes a 14-sided desk, made of wood and translucent
Plexiglas, which also functions as a receptacle for notes visitors
might wish to leave behind. No wall-labels instruct you to do so, nor
is any hint given of what White will do with the information she
gathers. Mystery enters her pragmatic piece obliquely, leaving you
free to wonder just where design ends and art begins.</TE>

<HD>'Pepe le Moko' Prowls the Casbah Again</HD>
<DH>So, you've seen 'Algiers'? Here's a chance to marvel at the
beautifully crafted 1937 French gangster classic on which it's based.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Pepe le Moko" is the stuff that dreams are made of.</LD>
<LD>   An acknowledged classic of doomed romanticism and atmospheric
fatalism, this 1937 French film was such a hit on its release that
Hollywood promptly remade it as "Algiers" and kept the original off
U.S. screens for more than four years.</LD>
<LD>   Despite this, "Pepe le Moko" has been enormously influential, not
only in film but in numerous corners of American popular culture. It
rooted the exotic Casbah in our collective imaginations; it's what
Chuck Jones pillaged when he named a character Pepe le Pew; it's the
film without which "Casablanca" likely would not have been made.</LD>
<TE>   Directed by Julien Duvivier, it featured the iconic actor Jean
Gabin in one of his signature roles and intoxicated almost everyone
who saw it, from Jean Cocteau ("a masterpiece") to Pauline Kael
("superb filmmaking") to Graham Greene, who called it "one of the
most exciting and moving films I remember seeing," a feature that
succeeded by "raising the thriller to a poetic level."</TE>
<TE>   Unseen in 35-millimeter in this country for nearly 60 years,
"Pepe" is the latest deserving recipient of the Rialto Pictures
make-over treatment. Rialto, which has re-released such French
classics as "Rififi," "Contempt" and "Band of Outsiders," struck a
newly restored print and used Lenny Borger to write new subtitles
that capture the spirit as well as the letter of Henri Jeanson's
glowing dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Playing at the Nuart in West Los Angeles for a week, "Pepe" is
hardly some revered relic suitable only for a museum shelf.
Beautifully crafted, movingly acted, still involving and
entertaining, this is just the kind of film people are talking about
when they say they don't make them like this anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the credit goes to star Gabin in the title role. He plays
a French gangster who robbed a bank in Paris of millions of francs
and then fled to the Casbah, the Arab quarter of Algiers, with his
gang.</TE>
<TE>   Fearless, humane, an intensely masculine and unflappably
charismatic presence who was completely natural on screen, Gabin is a
star for whom there is no exact American equivalent. Often cast as a
doomed man, the actor combines characteristics of Gary Cooper and
Jimmy Cagney and comes up with an immaculately dressed gangster who
makes women feel faint. Pepe may notice a woman's jewels first, but
he's too much of a gentleman to say so.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the French police are exasperated beyond words at their
inability to capture Pepe, who has eluded them for two years in the
labyrinthine Casbah, "where dark, winding streets form a jumble of
mazes ... colorful, dynamic, multifaceted, there's not one Casbah but
thousands."</TE>
<TE>   A true prince of thieves, Pepe is so beloved in the Casbah that
police can't make a move against him without his knowing every step
they take. "He's God up there," someone says. "You can't arrest God."
Only the oily, insinuating Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux) thinks
he can capture the man, if only he can find the proper bait to lure
him downtown.</TE>
<TE>   With Ines the Gypsy (Line Noro) as his current flame, Pepe may be
irresistible to the opposite sex, but he's never been in love. "I
give them my body," he says, "but I keep my head."</TE>
<TE>   Pepe also has a dark secret: His refuge has become a prison.
Starting to feel hemmed in by the Casbah, Pepe finds himself missing
Paris more and more.</TE>
<TE>   All these feelings intensify when Pepe has a chance meeting with
the glamorous Parisian Gaby (Mireille Balin), visiting Algiers as the
mistress of a champagne tycoon. True to form, Pepe notices her
platinum and diamond bracelets first, but soon he is mad for her,
oblivious to the numerous complex webs woven around him as the film
moves toward its celebrated poetic ending, redolent with longing and
despair.</TE>
<TE>   None of this could have succeeded as well as it does without the
exemplary work of director Duvivier. Combining location work with
studio scenes, he fills "Pepe" with teeming street life, the physical
parallel to the film's psychological world of scheming,
double-dealing and betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   His Casbah is magical and dangerous, a place of whispers and
shadows, where the unforgettably exotic lies just beyond a beaded
curtain.</TE>

<HD>In on the Con in 'Nine Queens'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentine director Fabian Bielinsky's "Nine Queens" is a deliciously
funny and fiendishly clever con-man comedy that begins on a note of
ingenuity that it then sustains with the tension of a high-wire act.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how it goes: A young man, Juan (Gaston Pauls), gets caught
trying to pull off a bill-changing scam in a Buenos Aires convenience
store. Another man, Marcos (Ricardo Darin), steps up, shows his
police badge and promptly arrests Juan, telling the clerk that the
stolen cash will be returned from the police station. Out on the
street, Marcos, handing the money back to Juan, is soon sizing up the
younger man he has never before met as a potential partner in crime.</LD>
<LD>   Suave, debonair Marcos is an irrepressible, practiced swindler
with a cynical view of human nature. Juan seems more conflicted,
explaining that he's learned the tricks from his con-man father but
employs them only out of desperation. In no time, Marcos is
steamrolling Juan's uncertainties, but Juan surprises his new
partner-mentor with his ability to think on his feet.</LD>
<TE>   An amusing clutch of plot convolutions drops a potential windfall
in the laps of our new con team in the form of the "Nine Queens," a
sheet of nine rare Weimar Republic stamps that could bring them close
to half a million dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Complications escalate, increasing the challenges facing Marcos
and Juan in snagging their payday. Bielinsky, however, does not
merely milk their predicament for laughs but has done so in an
admirably organic way. In other words, everything occurs at the
juncture of fate and character, in an inspired manner that leaves the
film remarkably free from contrivance.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine Queens" is also graceful and fluid for all the verbal
sparring between Marcos and Juan, and between them and others they
encounter. What's more, most of the film takes place in one locale,
the vast Buenos Aires Hilton, where Marcos' sister Valeria (Leticia
Bredice) works as a concierge and regards her crooked brother with
hostility--and where the team's key mark (Ignasi Abadal) happens to
be staying.</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual and fortuitous that an actor in a foreign film gets
to consolidate a strong impression in one film and then follow it up
while the first picture is still in release. That's what's happened
to Darin, who first in the title role of the Oscar-nominated "Son of
the Bride" and now in "Nine Queens" emerges as a focused, edgy actor
adroit at expressing character flaws beneath a glib surface. The
boyish-looking Pauls is the perfect foil for Darin's oily Marcos, and
Bielinsky, a film veteran in an assured feature directing debut,
fills the screen with a gallery of vivid, largely raffish types, one
of them played by veteran star Elsa Berenguer.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to watch "Nine Queens" without being reminded of the
sly sleight-of-hand films David Mamet has made with his friend,
master prestidigitator Ricky Jay. "Nine Queens" has Hollywood remake
written all over it, and no one could be better able to pull it off
than Mamet. At the same time, "Nine Queens" is the kind of foreign
film that appeals to those who don't usually sit still for subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: amoral themes,
some blunt language; suitable for mature older children.</TE>

<HD>Scene-Stealing Enhances a Classic Feydeau Farce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Am I overdoing it?" Onstage at the Geffen Playhouse, Carol Kane is
asking herself that question as Madame Latour, an unforgettably
blowzy, lustful, drunken ruin of French nobility, and you thank the
gods of theater that the answer is yes.</LD>
<LD>   In its best moments, David Schweizer's staging of Georges
Feydeau's sexless sex farce "He Hunts" (a.k.a. "Monsieur Chasse!")
boils down to an Olympic-class event in tag-team scene-stealing. But
at the opening performance on Wednesday, it was Kane who proved the
master thief.</LD>
<LD>   Abandoning her endearing squeak of a voice for a sound halfway
between Tallulah Bankhead and Maggie Smith, she delivered cliches
("Do not knock it until you've tried it") as if they were brilliant
aphorisms and epigrams as if they were extra commandments that Moses
forgot to mention.</LD>
<TE>   "Society will excuse bad behavior," she intoned late in Act 1,
"but it will never, never forgive bad taste." That's as deep as "He
Hunts" ever gets, though Feydeau's study of what we might call
transactional adultery does expertly skewer 1892 French morality as a
public sham--an act of theater in which nobody suspends disbelief for
long.</TE>
<TE>   As translated and adapted by Philip Littell, the play is a French
tease, with everyone talking about sex, planning sex, remembering sex
but nobody getting any. Even before the play begins, Chris Barreca's
gleaming upholstered proscenium (like the headboard of a bed) and
peek-a-boo front curtain get us into the proper spirit by creating a
kind of boudoir stage. Domestic scenes take place inside thick walls
of simmering red and seduction amid flowing fabrics of gold and
white.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody looks more handsome in David Zinn's period costumes than
Valarie Pettiford as Leontine, and nobody projects wordless
consternation more forcefully. Essentially "He Hunts" is her story: a
wife learning that her husband is unfaithful and launching her own
experiment in infidelity. Replacing the originally cast Megan
Mullally, Pettiford anchors the action in resolutely reasonable
behavior, which makes the lovers' spats less fun than they might be
but gives the rest of the cast a performance of authority to play
against.</TE>
<TE>   And play they do. You could argue that "He Hunts" never really
comes alive, that Feydeau's innovations in plotting and pacing have
been so completely absorbed into the mechanics of farce on stage,
screen and the tube that there's nothing left in the play itself to
surprise us and no character to care about.</TE>
<TE>   But you'd be forgetting these aggressively colorful
performances--Cathy Lind Hayes as Babet, for instance, a maid who
exudes profound existential distaste in every look and inflection. Or
Alan Mandell as Bridois, a magistrate just as eager to uphold the law
as cop a feel and not too old to manage both simultaneously. Or
Daniel Kucan as Gontreins, the athletic new-generation lecher, so hot
that he doesn't always check his partners' genders before jumping
their bones.</TE>
<TE>   Most desperate of all, Stephen Nichols as Moricet seems always on
the verge of bedding Leontine but suffers a plague of
humiliations--including being constantly upstaged by Kane.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols whines effectively and his air of desperate improvisation
when things go from catastrophe to worse earns plenty of laughs.</TE>
<TE>   But you never believe the lust in his performance and, without a
sexual imperative, key scenes remain underdriven.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Maxwell Caulfield makes the Teflon philanderer Duchotel
a little too businesslike, genuinely emotional only for a single
instant, and then strictly as a matter of pride. As circumstances
pile up against him in the final scene, he could be much funnier if
we glimpsed something other than his unflappable, bone-deep
dishonesty.</TE>
<TE>   Caulfield adopts British inflections for the role while Hayes
gives us a French maid with a French accent. V.J. Foster as the
crusty Cassecul goes for corn pone Americana and Kucan behaves as if
he's auditioning for a Disney Channel teen series.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody beats Pettiford, who can rasp and coo in the same
phrase and go from grande dame pretension to say-what street jive
just as fast.</TE>
<TE>   They may be all left swimming in the wake of Kane's towering
eccentricities, but they animate a relic of theater history with
enough zest that they, too, can say they're overdoing it, to the
greater glory of French drama, Western culture and sheer excess as a
principle to live by.</TE>

<HD>A Cultural Clash in 'Greek Wedding'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's not a lot of voice-over narration in "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding." But what little there is convinces you that the original
stage monologue by Nia Vardalos would have been a hoot to hear. You
don't have to be Greek to chuckle at the affectionate jabs Vardalos
aims at her loving, smothering family.</LD>
<LD>   Little wonder that Tom Hanks and his Greek-born actress wife, Rita
Wilson, loved it enough to co-produce (with Gary Goetzman) a filmed
adaptation, written by Vardalos and set not in her native Canada but
in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   That's not a problem, but there are, alas, others with a movie
that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it
depicts.</LD>
<TE>   It's not surprising that Vardalos' story has become an elongated
domestic sitcom since it's directed by Joel Zwick, whose resume
includes such go-for-the-gut TV fare as "Laverne &amp; Shirley," "Full
House" and "Family Matters." What is surprising is how clunky and
wobbly it looks even with the talent involved both in front of and
behind the cameras. Some folks--including, perhaps, Vardalos
herself--apparently decided that the only way to open up the
monologue and serve it to the masses was as an urban fairy tale with
ham fists and thick shtick.</TE>
<TE>   Which proves a disservice, most notably, to Vardalos the actress,
who for at least most of the first couple of acts is touching and
sweetly affecting as her fictional alter-ego Toula Portokalos,
thirtysomething, unmarried and apparently quite willing to spend the
rest of her days as a drab, nondescript waitress for her family's
restaurant, Dancing Zorba's.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to her a finer destiny than the one mapped out by her
crusty old-school father, Gus (Michael Constantine): Find any Greek
man, make babies and feed everybody. (Gus, by the way, has these
funny little tics of using Windex for medicinal purposes and of
claiming Greek origins for every single word, even Japanese ones. As
with a lot of the riffs in this film, it's funnier the first or
second time than it is the seventh or 12th.)</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, the proverbial handsome prince--a WASP-ish college
instructor named Ian (John Corbett, essentially playing the same
laid-back heartthrob as he did in "Sex and the City") shows up at the
restaurant and gives Toula reasons to shed her moldy reserve and go
off on her own. Eventually, improbably, Toula and Ian reconnect, fall
in love and become engaged. Thus begins a noisy, cumbersome build-up
to the wedding, throughout which you stumble over cheap jokes at the
expense of both Toula's family and Ian's. Even Richard Pryor would
think his parents are portrayed as a little too white-bread prim. All
told, this is going to make passable television. Eventually.</TE>

Some risque humor, mild vulgarities.</TE>

<HD>By the End, 'Monster' Is a Different Beast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A seemingly assimilated Vietnamese American teenager is missing
from his mobile home in a suburb of Los Angeles. One of his classmates, a
more recent arrival from Vietnam, is in the hospital after being
assaulted near the school. A Vietnamese American detective is on the
case.</LD>
<LD>     'Monster,' by Derek Nguyen, begins as a contemporary noir narrative
but ends as something quite different--a subtly spooky script that casts
aside realism to become a poignant reflection on the haunted
psychological journey faced by Vietnamese Americans and other veterans of
America's blighted experiences in Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>     The first part of 'Monster' includes some apparently clumsy
moments--but that impression is somewhat mitigated later, when you
realize what Nguyen is up to. The second half takes such an imaginative
leap that the play becomes, on balance, one of East West's most
successful premieres since the company moved to Little Tokyo. It's also
the company's first play by a Vietnamese American.</LD>
<TE>     Flora (Diana Kay Cameron), a waitress, has hired detective Tran
(Trieu Tran) to find her missing 15-year-old son. Years ago, the boy was
adopted from Vietnam by Flora and her now ex-husband, Wray (Richard
Ruyle). Wray is a war veteran whose exposure to Agent Orange led doctors
to advise him not to sire children of his own.</TE>
<TE>     Tran identifies with the missing boy because he, too, was adopted
from Vietnam at an early age. But he is puzzled as he learns that the boy
is now suspected of being one of those who beat up their immigrant
classmate Khoi (Nghia Luu). Why would a Vietnamese American teenager join
the school jocks in a hate crime against another Vietnamese kid?</TE>
<TE>     As usual for noir detectives, this one has his own troubles. His
handicapped infant daughter recently died. His marriage to Molly (Nicole
Porter) is collapsing.</TE>
<TE>     But Nguyen begins breaking out of the noir tradition with little
details fairly soon. A few of these are unnecessarily awkward. Too often,
a line from earlier in the play is briefly repeated as a flashback,
accompanied by a spotlight and an echo effect to hammer home its new
resonance.</TE>
<TE>     On a pickier level, how does the detective so easily find out that
the missing boy's girlfriend recently sought an abortion? Or this: Did
Nguyen know, when he set his play in 'the fictional city of Sun Valley,
Calif.,' that there is a real Sun Valley neighborhood in the San Fernando
Valley?</TE>
<TE>     By the time the play's biggest twist takes place, however, it's
clear that Nguyen has many things on his mind besides fidelity to a genre
or to objective facts. We won't discuss the details of that twist; just
be prepared for some mind-bending.</TE>
<TE>     Tim Dang's staging follows the play's contours, with Tran's
performance evolving slowly from an early tentativeness into a powerful
passion. Cameron's Flora is commendably absent of the cool elegance
that's usually found in the wealthier women who employ noir private eyes.</TE>
<TE>     Patricia Belcher plays a counselor and then adds most of the play's
comic notes as an underappreciated but sympathetic worker at an adoption
agency. Porter switches between the roles of Tran's wife and the missing
boy's girlfriend so adeptly that I was unaware she was the same actress
until I checked the program. Khoi as the wounded immigrant and Brian
Kolodziej as the head jock are especially good in their brief scenes.</TE>
<TE>     Victoria Petrovich's big blue set isn't representational but still
seems too solid and monolithic for a script that has so many little
scenes and flashbacks. But Guido Girardi's lighting adds clarity as well
as atmosphere, and Nathan Wang's ominous sound effects heighten the
suspense.</TE>

<HD>So, Who Did What to Whom? Let's Go to the 'Tape'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. Kathleen Foley, David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tape," being presented by the Naked Angels at the Coast Playhouse,
made such a splash when it ran off-Broadway that it was recently made
into a film with Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy to see why playwright Stephen Belber's "Rashomon"-like
story of friendship, drugs and betrayal filled seats during an
extended run in New York. Fiercely stylish and at times bitingly
funny, the play taps into the galvanic angst of its 20-something male
characters, Vince (Dominic Fumusa) and Jon (Josh Stamberg), best
buddies in high school who have since gone their separate
paths--Vince to small-time drug dealing, Jon to low-budget art film
directing. However, Belber's modern-day amorality tale gyrates
through so many plot twists and manufactured "surprises" that it
ultimately sprains its dramatic integrity. That's a shame, because
Fumusa and Stamberg, who starred in the New York production, are
mesmerizing in these roles, written especially for them by Belber,
perhaps best known as a co-writer of "The Laramie Project," the
off-Broadway hit about the death of Matthew Shepard.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the action transpires in Vince's cheesy motel room,
convincingly rendered by set designer George Xenos. Vince, an
inarticulate burnout who seems sputtering toward an imminent
explosion, has traveled to Lansing, Mich., for Jon's premiere at a
small film festival. The guys hook up for some beer, weed and
reminiscences. But behind the boozy badinage, Vince has a hidden
agenda--forcing the effusively self-serving Jon to admit that, 10
years ago, he raped Amy (Alison West), Vince's high school
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Or did he? Whether or not a crime actually occurred is at issue in
this insubstantial drama, which toys with our notions of reality to a
fault. It doesn't help that director Geoffrey Nauffts has miscast the
role of Amy, who enters the picture later in a less showy but
nonetheless crucial role. Not that West (who appeared in the most
recent off-Broadway production, but did not originate the role) isn't
an attractive and serviceable actor. However, in contrast to the
sizzling Fumusa and Stamberg, she borders on the innocuous, putting a
further drag on the play's momentum just when a boost is sorely
needed.</TE>

<TE>   The Famous Speak 'In Their Own Words'</TE>
<TE>   The legends inadvertently skewer themselves in "In Their Own
Words: Celebrity Autobiographies," a literary cabaret of excerpts
from star memoirs, playing Sundays at Bar F2. Creator Eugene Pack
(whose fascination with this genre stems from Mary Tyler Moore's
description of potato preparation) and a uniformly adept cast avoid
impersonations, letting the alleged prose carry the satiric weight.</TE>
<TE>   Such undecorated focus upon often innately risible writing results
in hilarious tabloid reader's theater. The offhanded staging offers
successive solo readings, themes varying weekly, and a signature
group exercise conflating related material from three different
sources.</TE>
<TE>   This last is inspired, the performance under review weaving the
confessionals of Eddie Fisher (Pack), Debbie Reynolds (co-producer
Dale Rehfeld) and Elizabeth Taylor (Saratoga Ballantine) into an
uproarious tell-all cantata.</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts include Ellen Idelson's brightly incongruous Mr.
T., Jack Plotnick's savagely elfin delivery of QVC icon Kathy
Levine's platitudes, and Steve Atinsky's devastating interpretation
of Elizabeth Ashley at her most scabrous.</TE>
<TE>   The intimate venue recalls the heyday of NYC cafe society legend
Julius Monk, minus music and production values. They might take a cue
from their Acme Comedy neighbors next door and add a synthesizer for
extra texture.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the affectionate ruthlessness on display, plus the
option of fine Italian cuisine from the downstairs Giancarlo
(formerly Farfalla) restaurant, easily recommends this tickling
entertainment.</TE>

<TE>   'Gangster Planet' in a Sitcom Universe</TE>
<TE>   A familiar face in film and television for the last 20-some years,
Taylor Negron first made his name as a stand-up comic, a caustic
observer of society in general and Los Angeles in particular. A
professional wasp, Negron has made a career out of bedeviling the
sacred cows of popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   However, there's more buzz than sting to "Gangster Planet," a
revival of the 1993 comedy co-written by Negron and Lawrence Justice,
now at the Egyptian Arena Theatre. Although Negron and his fellow
actors zing in a succession of trenchant one-liners, the laughs just
can't compensate for a shaky plot and sitcom premise.</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1992, the play revolves around Sandy (Negron), a
struggling, pot-pushing Los Angeles resident whose wealthy parents
(David Groh and Jeanette O'Connor) have just gone bust, and must now
move in with their son while they recoup. Naturally, Sandy isn't keen
on the prospect of so much parental propinquity, particularly with
his father, a former cop who sold out his ideals to work for a
low-level crime boss. But just as Sandy is adjusting to the invasion
of his privacy, the Los Angeles riots erupt.</TE>
<TE>   From the vantage point of Sandy's Hollywood Hills rental, the
dismayed Sandy, his folks and his flamboyantly gay neighbor Menno
(Simon N. Butera) watch the city burn below. Not to worry. Inside
Sandy's apartment, the atmosphere is decidedly cozy, and the chatter
witty, if a bit meandering.</TE>
<TE>   Director Justin Tanner, himself a noted playwright and director
known for his offbeat send-ups of modern culture, pitches the tone of
the production just a step above the naturalistic. It's the right
tack for this tongue-in-cheek period piece, a Chautauqua Theatre
Alliance production timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of
the riots. By resorting to the tried, true and predictable, Negron
shortchanges that event. However, he and his consistently engaging
fellow actors have enough panache to ameliorate, if not overcome, the
limitations of their material.</TE>

<HD>The Case for Dvorak</HD>
<DH>The Pacific Symphony begins a celebration of the composer's
American' music.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throwing his hands up in despair at an unanswerable question, Virgil
Thomson once wrote that American music is nothing more or less than
music written by Americans. But even that may not be a broad enough
definition any longer. Wednesday night, the Pacific Symphony began an
eight-day festival exploring the three years Dvorak spent as director
of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City. And it
proposed that the Czech composer and celebrated Bohemian nationalist
wrote American music too.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Horowitz, the artistic advisor of the Dvorak in America
Festival (the second in the Pacific Symphony's annual explorations of
an aspect of American music), claims that Dvorak's "American" Suite,
written in 1895, is so infused with the essence of our national
style--with its adaptations of the cakewalk, the plantation song,
Native American drumming--that it not only speaks our language but
actually presages such later composers as Gershwin.</LD>
<LD>   A compelling case for this was made on the opening program, which
included performances of the suite in its original piano version,
wonderfully played by Robert Thies as a prelude to the concert, and
then enthusiastically performed in its orchestrated version conducted
by Carl St.Clair.</LD>
<TE>   But American musical life being what it is, the lure that
attracted Wednesday night's large and well-heeled crowd to hear three
pieces composed in America in 1895 was the most famous Russian
musician of our time, Mstislav Rostropovich, as soloist in Dvorak's
Cello Concerto.</TE>
<TE>   Although written during his last year in New York and inspired by
Victor Herbert's Second Cello Concerto (which will be performed by
the Pacific Symphony Wednesday and Thursday), Dvorak's concerto has
rarely been regarded as "American" (one Dvorak scholar, Michael
Beckerman, is an exception).</TE>
<TE>   And, in fact, over the past half century, this popular concerto
has never thrived more than it has in the intensely emotional hands
of the Russian cellist.</TE>
<TE>   Rostropovich is now 75 and an icon. His birthday last month was an
international occasion, and Rostropovich is still celebrating it with
a touring schedule of solo performances and conducting engagements
that would tire a man half his age. And maybe it is tiring even him,
given that Rostropovich seemed, at least for him, subdued. His tone,
of course, is no longer that of the young man who played like a god.
And fast passages now, while still impressively fleet, display
obvious effort. But on this evening there was a new hint of weariness
as well.</TE>
<TE>   In early recordings from the 1950s of this piece, Rostropovich
poured out rapture as if from a bottomless pit. No longer suggesting
such urgency, he now demonstrates his greatness in the many levels of
melancholy he brings to the more lyrical themes. The deeply touching
ending of the concerto was a moment of particular beauty, of
tenderness exquisitely nuanced.</TE>
<TE>   At his most eloquent, Rostropovich goes beyond interpretation and
seems to embody the music itself. And he sustained such eloquence
throughout an encore, a Bach sarabande, its final note fading off
into transcendental silence, suggesting a world far away from
Dvorak's America.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even Rostropovich's performance of the Dvorak had something
to say about America's unavoidable culture clashes. Next to the
seasoned Russian, St.Clair was the young, occasionally brash
American.</TE>
<TE>   Once or twice, he seemed eager to spur the cellist on, but mainly
he demonstrated sensitive deference when the orchestra's job was to
accompany, waiting to whip it up into a showy storm when it was on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   For the first half of the program, however, St.Clair was there to
sell the music all the way. The "American" Suite, which tends to
sound more mellow in the hands of Czech conductors, was purposefully
bright and outgoing. And St.Clair brought plenty of verve to a true
rarity, George Chadwick's "Jubilee," which opened the concert.</TE>
<TE>   This movement from Chadwick's "Symphonic Sketches," is an early
and engaging example of an American composer dressing vernacular
sources in conventional late 19th century symphonic cloth. It's well
done, if not nearly as distinctive as what Charles Ives would soon
achieve.</TE>
<TE>   But hearing it did an excellent job of piquing interest in what
this fascinating festival intends as it unearths the neglected roots
of our national musical character.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Symphony's Dvorak in America Festival continues
through April 25, with concerts and ancillary events at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

<HD>'Enigma': Deciphering Codes and Allegiances</HD>
<DH>Filmmaker Michael Apted brings suspense--and romance--to a
re-creation of the effort to interpret Nazi messages in WWII.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though "Enigma" has a plot almost as hard to crack as the Nazi
coding device that gives this World War II thriller its name, it is
such a grand, romantic entertainment that it sweeps the viewer along
in its swiftly escalating suspense.</LD>
<LD>   More unpredictable than it first seems, "Enigma" crackles with
Michael Apted's vigorous, perceptive direction from a superior script
by Tom Stoppard from the 1995 Robert Harris bestseller.</LD>
<LD>   A complex, meticulous period re-creation down to the tiniest
detail, this handsome production marks the debut of Jagged Films,
founded by Mick Jagger and Victoria Pearman, with "Saturday Night
Live's" Lorne Michaels joining in as Jagger's co-producer.</LD>
<TE>   "Enigma" could also apply to the beautiful blond Claire Romilly
(Saffron Burrows) who is among the many staffers at Bletchley Park,
an elegant old country estate 60 miles north of London that the
British government turned into a top-secret site for its
code-breakers just before the outbreak of World War II. Among her
countless pursuers is the brilliant young Cambridge mathematician Tom
Jericho (Dougray Scott) recruited to help break the Enigma code.</TE>
<TE>   But the German navy has changed its code--the year is
1943--placing an Allied merchant shipping convoy in the Atlantic with
10,000 passengers and vital supplies at risk from Nazi U-boats.</TE>
<TE>   Jericho, who tells Claire he loves mathematics because "truth and
beauty are one," falls head over heels for her. Tom is so besotted
with her he suffers a breakdown, only to be returned to Bletchley
Park a month later, and learns that Claire has been missing for 14
hours. Gathering his resolve and aided by Claire's smart roommate and
co-worker Hester (Kate Winslet), Jericho attempts to break the code
while investigating the mystery of Claire's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   What unfolds is a complex tale of love, betrayal and high
adventure as Tom and Hester quickly realize they must stay one step
ahead of the Bletchley Park administration and the secret service,
represented by the clever and persistent Wigram (Jeremy Northam).</TE>
<TE>   A memorable Ivor Novello in "Gosford Park," Northam is crucial in
sparking his scenes with Scott, whose Jericho is listless and dazed
upon his departure from a mental institution. Scott, however,
expresses Jericho's growing strength persuasively, and Winslet is a
delight as one of the movies' most cherished archetypes--the brainy
girl who proves to be a beauty under her unflattering glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Seamus McGarvey's burnished camerawork, John Barry's magisterial
score, Shirley Russell's costumes and Jenny Shircore's makeup and
hair designs are all terrific pluses, but John Beard must be singled
out for special praise for his spot-on and evocative production
design. When the real Bletchley Park, now a museum, proved impossible
to use for exteriors because of all the modern buildings surrounding
it, Beard re-created it in the similar Chicheley Hall, also north of
London.</TE>
<TE>   While "Enigma" is a clever blend of fact and fiction, it is worth
pointing out that the tragic life of Alan Turing, the actual
mathematical genius of Bletchley Hall, was dramatized in the play
"Breaking the Code," in which Derek Jacobi won great acclaim as the
tormented Turing.</TE>

<HD>A Closer Look at 'Everyday Heroes'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Striding through the rough Richmond, Calif., neighborhood in the East
Bay where he grew up, AmeriCorps volunteer Ivan Alomar was a bookworm
on a mission. His destination: the local elementary school, where he
would spend another afternoon talking to the kids and spreading the
joys of reading.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm tired," said the strapping 23-year-old. "I've been reading
enough books about how we ain't had it and all that, how we're
minorities and we got it bad. I'm ready to write some new books."</LD>
<LD>   Alomar and others from the East Bay's AmeriCorps team are the
focus of "Everyday Heroes" (10 p.m., KCET), a documentary by Rick
Goldsmith and Abby Ginzberg that presents a reassuring portrait of
the post-Generation X crowd.</LD>
<TE>   About 40,000 Americans serve in the so-called domestic Peace
Corps, which was started in 1994. This film follows one ethnically
diverse team over the course of the yearlong program, as the 21
volunteers work with children in Richmond, Berkeley and Oakland on
projects such as public gardening, AIDS awareness, literacy and
outdoor adventure, all in exchange for a modest stipend. At times
this film, which is told mainly in fly-on-the-wall style and without
narration, can be more confusing and frustrating than inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most likable volunteers gets dumped from the program
because of poor attendance vaguely attributed to troubles at home. In
a tense scene, the remaining volunteers verbally gang up on team
leader S.E., whose only sin appears to be shushing those who
interrupt her.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, "Everyday Heroes" offers a contrast to the
cynical and apathetic view of young adulthood seen so often in the

<HD>Painless Sting</HD>
<DH>Nonstop action, bloodless violence and scantily dressed
vixens--can you smell what 'The Scorpion King' is cooking?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone's gone to the trouble of making a comic-book version of "The
Scorpion King," but it's not clear why they bothered. The movie
itself is a live-action cartoon, a fast-moving and cheerfully
simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the
preteen boy in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Although it features wrestling star the Rock in the title role and
is energetically directed by journeyman Chuck Russell, the driving
force behind "The Scorpion King" appears to be "The Mummy"/"The Mummy
Returns" director Stephen Sommers, who co-produced as well as
co-wrote the story (with Jonathan Hales) and the screenplay (with
William Osborne and David Hayter).</LD>
<LD>   Together, all these people and the rest of "Scorpion's" creative
team seemed to have ransacked so many Saturday-afternoon serials for
plot devices that you almost expect to see the dreaded Chandu or Ming
the Merciless skulking around somewhere in the background. As much as
anything else, "The Scorpion King" has a low-budget soul inside an
A-picture budget.</LD>
<TE>   Most of that budget has gone into the film's nearly nonstop
action, the briskly cartoonish doings that are inevitable when your
hero is a head-knocking, knife-throwing, arrow-shooting,
sword-wielding, over-parapet-tossing kind of guy.</TE>
<TE>   Using two stunt coordinators plus a sword-fight coordinator as
well as someone who handled "additional stunt coordination and fight
choreography," "The Scorpion King's" action is so furious yet so
fastidious that unless I dozed off (unlikely, given the
circumstances) and missed one, there's not a drop of blood to be
seen.</TE>
<TE>   There's also not a lot of clothing to be seen on "Scorpion King's"
legion of barely clad women, from harem residents to warriors, all of
whom are costumed like they just wandered in from a sunny day in
Malibu. If the ancient world had this much in common with "Baywatch,"
it's been a well-kept secret.</TE>
<TE>   "The Scorpion King's" saving grace, as much as it has one, is that
it is unpretentious, refusing to take itself too seriously. This is a
film in which a character says, with as much of a straight face as he
can muster, "After a hard day of looting and pillaging, there's no
greater city than Gomorrah." Pause. "Unless it's Sodom." OK, it's not
Chekhov, but Chekhov never had to write bridge dialogue between
action elements.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, how seriously could any film take itself with
the Rock as its star? But if the wrestler is not a guy you'd want to
be doing "Hamlet" (his trademark eye-widening likely wouldn't work
for the Prince of Denmark), he does have excellent action-hero
presence and great fighting skills, and that's really all that's
required.</TE>
<TE>   The Rock's movie career began with a cameo in "The Mummy Returns,"
and the new film, set 5,000 years in the past, before the unforgiving
desert knew from either pharaohs or pyramids, is billed as kind of a
prequel to those momentous events.</TE>
<TE>   The Rock plays Mathayus, the last of the Akkadians, a group of
assassins "trained for generations in the deadly arts," whatever they
are. He's hired by some bedraggled tribes to stop the dreaded
conqueror Memnon (Russell Crowe look-alike Steven Brand), who will,
yes, stop at nothing to take over the world.</TE>
<TE>   Memnon, however, has a secret weapon, and she happens to look
awfully good in those abbreviated costumes that were standard issue
in the ancient world. That would be the sorceress Cassandra, played
by Kelly Hu, an actress whose black belt in karate does not go wasted
in this role.</TE>
<TE>   One of the oddly amusing aspects of "The Scorpion King" are the
loopy philosophical discussions between Memnon and his increasingly
restive sorceress, who is far from immune to the charms of the hunky
Akkadian. "You think I'm cruel, don't you, but I am only order after
centuries of chaos," the ruler says. "Rivers of blood can never bring
peace" is her comeback, topped by Memnon's "But it can bring
obedience, and that is enough for now." Whatever.</TE>
<TE>   These deep thoughts aside, "The Scorpion King" is all about the
action. Can a scruffy camel-riding guy whose motto (often repeated)
is live free, die well (why not the other way around?) defeat a
powerful military leader and "the greatest swordsman the world has
ever seen." No need to dignify that question with an answer.</TE>
<TE>   "The Scorpion King" also has a kind of genial disregard of the
niceties of classical filmmaking. It doesn't care that its characters
have more clashing accents than the U.N. General Assembly.
Indifferent to the virtues of spending large sums on location travel,
it is proudly shot largely in the great state of California. It
doesn't even care that its hero, the once and future king, was
introduced as a villain in the last picture. When the swords are
singing, what else could possibly matter?</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense scenes of action violence and some
sensuality. Times guidelines: no blood but lots of slaughter.</TE>

<HD>'World Traveler' Sets Off on a Trip to Self-Hood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"World Traveler" opens with a collage of disturbing images, the
symbolic meaning of which becomes clear by the time this subtle,
elliptical road movie reaches its destination.</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by Bart Freundlich, it stars Billy Crudup as
a successful architect in his early 30s with a beautiful wife,
adorable little son and a tasteful West Village apartment. Perhaps
because all of this has come too easily for Crudup's Cal, he starts
feeling so suffocated that he is driven to drop out and hit the road
in search of answers.</LD>
<LD>   The film is perhaps best enjoyed as a minor work with some major
pluses, notably in the characterizations and in their adroit
portrayals. As intelligent and sophisticated as it is, it is not so
complex or original as Freundlich, who made his 1997 feature debut
with the family drama "The Myth of Fingerprints," might have wished.
Its principal asset is Crudup, who is unafraid to reveal Cal's
immaturity and self-absorption.</LD>
<TE>   Heading West, he first stops over in a western Pennsylvania town,
persuaded to stay long enough to pull himself together by a
sympathetic and very available diner waitress (Karen Allen). Cal
longs for human contact but essentially thinks only of his own needs,
although he is constantly haunted by the wife and son he has
deserted. The moment he thinks he's being hedged in or made to feel
overly responsible for another person's welfare, he moves on.</TE>
<TE>   At first Cal seems to be crossing the continent aimlessly, but
(quite possibly subconsciously) he would seem to have a specific
destination after all, which ultimately proves pivotal for him and
gives the film its meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, he meets some memorable people. Besides Allen there
is Cleavant Derricks as a construction worker too kindly for his own
good and Mary McCormack as his no-nonsense wife; a pretty, carefree
hitchhiker (Liane Baliban); and a high school classmate (James
LeGros) who has held a grudge against him for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Most important are a lengthy encounter with a runaway wife
(Julianne Moore) who has bigger problems than Cal at first realizes,
and with his long-estranged father (David Keith). Moore brings a
commanding presence and depth to this glamorous but reckless, deeply
troubled woman, and Keith is wonderfully reserved.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, all of Cal's encounters are beautifully drawn vignettes.
"World Traveler" has an inviting look and feel, and the soundtrack
features a number of well-chosen Willie Nelson songs.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexuality. Times guidelines:
adult themes and situations plus heavy drinking.</TE>

<HD>Northwest, American, United Attempt to Raise Leisure Fares</HD>
<DH>Airlines: US Airways says it plans to apply for a federal
loan. Southwest manages a first-quarter profit of $21 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several major airlines tried again Thursday to nudge leisure fares
higher to generate badly needed revenue, and one hobbled carrier--US
Airways Group--said it plans to apply for a federally guaranteed
loan.</LD>
<LD>   Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, said its low costs again overcame
the air travel slump and enabled the discount airline to eke out a
first-quarter profit of $21 million. The rest of the industry is
expected to rack up first-quarter losses totaling $2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The fare increases varied among carriers. AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines, the industry's largest player, raised leisure fares
systemwide by up to $20 per round trip. Its move came after Northwest
Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines lifted discounted leisure
fares by similar amounts, but only on selected routes.</LD>
<TE>   The industry will be watching closely to see whether other
carriers match American and adopt the higher prices systemwide.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest's willingness to raise some fares was notable because
the fourth-largest U.S. carrier often balks at following others'
price hikes. Its refusal to match one started by Continental Airlines
last week ultimately torpedoed that increase because its stance
prompted others to roll back the higher fares.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways, a predominantly East Coast carrier and one of the
hardest-hit in the aftermath of Sept. 11, disclosed its plans to seek
a loan guarantee as it reported a $269-million first-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   Only one other major airline, America West, has tapped the loan
program, which was part of the $15-billion bailout enacted after the
attacks. The deadline for applications is June 28. US Airways
declined to say how much it plans to borrow.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest also reported a first-quarter loss of $171 million, or
$2.01 per diluted share, which was better than Wall Street expected.</TE>
<TE>   But Northwest and US Airways, like most other big airlines,
continue to be pummeled by the weak U.S. economy, reduced passenger
traffic and an overabundance of cheap fares that aren't generating
enough revenue to cover costs.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest, the leading provider of discount seats, said its
first-quarter profit equaled 3 cents per diluted share. That matched
forecasts of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call, but
was 82% below the $121 million, or 15 cents a share, Southwest earned
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The airline's first-quarter revenue fell 12% to $1.26 billion from
$1.43 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously pleased to avoid a loss," Gary Kelly, Southwest's
chief financial officer, said in a conference call. "Hopefully when
we get into the June-July time period, we'll see some improvement in
traffic and revenues as the economic recovery continues."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas-based Southwest said it expects earnings to steadily
improve this year, but warned that its second-quarter profit also
would fall well below the $176 million the carrier earned in the
second quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways said its first-quarter loss equaled $3.97 a share. A
year earlier, the airline lost $171 million, or $2.55 a share, and
its first-quarter revenue fell to $1.71 billion from $2.24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways' stock fell 28 cents to $5.92 a share and Southwest
lost 45 cents to $18.55 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Northwest dropped 16 cents to $19.89 a share on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Settlement Talks With Andersen Fail</HD>
<DH>Courts: Accounting firm would not accept the government's
terms for settling criminal allegations. Trial is scheduled for May
6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Settlement talks between the Justice Department and Arthur Andersen
collapsed Thursday, complicating the government's efforts to pursue
fraud allegations against Enron Corp. as well as Andersen's efforts
to survive.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of closed-door talks that appeared headed for a deal,
lawyers for Andersen informed federal prosecutors that they would not
accept the government's terms for settling criminal allegations
related to the firm's destruction of documents in the Enron case.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen wanted to keep the plea talks open, but Justice
Department lawyers, working against an internal deadline, declined
and decided to move forward with the scheduled May 6 trial on an
obstruction of justice charge, said Rusty Hardin, Andersen's defense
attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen "requested that we keep [the settlement offer] open, but
with the trial date looming, we could not. It's off the table," said
a Justice Department official. "There's nothing more for us to
negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   But Hardin left the door open for further talks.</TE>
<TE>   No single issue ended the negotiations, Hardin said. Rather, there
were several outstanding issues dividing both parties.</TE>
<TE>   "The two sides had such different views of what Arthur Andersen
could reasonably comply with in return for deferred prosecution of
the charge," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the negotiations with U.S. Atty. Leslie Caldwell were
"cordial and in good faith" but that the goverment's "demonic view"
of Andersen made it hard to reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Andersen and the Justice Department first met in
Washington two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Talks had intensified since then, and the two sides appeared to
have reached the basic framework for an agreement securing Andersen's
full cooperation in the Justice Department's probe into whether Enron
executives used fraudulent practices to conceal massive losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersen agreement would have been structured around a
"deferred prosecution," meaning that Andersen would effectively be
put on probation for several years. In such an arrangement, the
criminal charges would be dropped once Andersen's cooperation in the
Enron probe and its enactment of internal management reforms were
completed.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by former Anderson auditor David B. Duncan to plead
guilty last week to a felony obstruction charge stemming from his
role in the destruction of Enron-related documents put still more
pressure on Andersen to reach a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Officials close to the talks had signaled since late last week
that a formal plea deal could be announced any day.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither side was willing to identify the ultimate
deal-breaker, conflicts appear to have centered on several areas,
including the effect that Andersen's cooperation in the Enron probe
would have on how other clients view its commitment to maintain
confidentiality.</TE>
<TE>   Talks also were complicated by Andersen's desire to work out a
simultaneous resolution of related civil lawsuits and potential
actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Legal observers said the SEC's ongoing investigation could
represent an even greater threat to Andersen than the Justice
Department's criminal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were going to make a judgment as to why this broke down, I
would wonder whether Andersen was seeking a global settlement of all
these actions," including the SEC probe, said David S. Ruder, a
securities law professor at Northwestern University and former SEC
chairman. "If Andersen is seeking viability, they'd want to resolve
all of that at once."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost more than 10% of it 2,300 public U.S. audit
clients and at least $600 million in audit revenue. On Thursday,
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Fox Entertainment Group Inc., as well
as 10 other companies, dropped Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Many business and legal observers believe that Andersen's future
viability depended at least in part on the firm reaching a deal,
rather than going to trial, having its skeletons aired publicly and
risking a criminal conviction.</TE>
<TE>   But the impasse in plea talks could hurt the Justice Department as
well, experts said, because a deal with Andersen had promised
authorities the prospect of the company's full cooperation in
dissecting the complexities of Enron's business arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors can still subpoena Andersen and its employees for
access to such information, but the Justice Department may have lost
a valuable partner in its probe, observers said. "The Justice
Department has lost some of its clout over Andersen," Ruder said.</TE>

<HD>Dole's 1st-Quarter Profit Rises 62%</HD>
<DH>Earnings roundup: Callaway Golf posts a 10% drop in net
income, while the Cheesecake Factory's jumps 26%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dole Food Co., the world's largest fruit and vegetable producer,
Thursday posted a 62% jump in first-quarter earnings, helped by
higher vegetable prices and lower costs.</LD>
<LD>   Westlake Village-based Dole said net income grew to $56.3 million,
or 99 cents a share, from $34.7 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier,
as sales rose 2.7% to $1.06 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The results handily beat analysts' average estimate of 68 cents,
according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Dole reduced costs by entering into more favorable contracts with
suppliers for commodities and paying less for fuel and paperboard to
package its produce, analysts said. The company also benefited from a
lettuce shortage, which led to higher prices industrywide, Dole said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just enjoying an exciting time in the market right now,"
said George Dahlman, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray who
rates Dole shares "outperform" and doesn't own them.</TE>
<TE>   Higher banana prices also boosted profit. A trade dispute in
Europe over bananas weighed on Dole's sales in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Dole shares rose $1.23 to $31.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies:</TE>
<TE>   * Callaway Golf Co., the largest golf club maker, reported a 10%
decline in first-quarter earnings to $30.7 million, or 45 cents a
share, and said second-quarter profit might miss earlier projections
because of declining sales in Japan. The results, reported after the
markets closed, beat analysts' expectations of 42 cents. Sales
slipped 1.9% to $256.4 million, and were down 24% in Japan amid a
tougher economic and competitive climate than anticipated, the
Carlsbad company said. Callaway projected second-quarter profit of 38
cents to 48 cents a share, compared with analysts' forecasts of 45
cents to 49 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Cheesecake Factory Inc. reported after the markets closed that
net income rose 26% to $10.6 million, or 21 cents a share, in its
first quarter, helped by lower costs. Revenue rose 25% to $150.2
million in the quarter ended April 2, and sales at restaurants open
at least a year were up 2%. The Calabasas company said it plans to
add as many as 12 restaurants during the fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. said net income rose 25% in its
fiscal second quarter to $26.9 million, or 49 cents a share,
including a change in accounting to eliminate the amortization of
goodwill, as revenue grew 10% to $1.1 billion. Without the accounting
change, profit would have been about 51 cents, the Pasadena company
said. Analysts were expecting 48 cents. Jacobs also said its backlog
of orders was up 0.9% to a record $6.5 billion when the quarter ended
March 31.</TE>
<TE>   * Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. said first-quarter net income
more than doubled to $23.3 million, or 51 cents a share, helped by
lower newsprint costs and an improving advertising market as well as
a change in accounting rules. Revenue declined 4% to $252.6 million.
The Sacramento-based company also said second-quarter profit would
exceed analysts' expectations by up to 4 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   * 99 Cents Only Stores said net income grew 25% in its first
quarter to $12.5 million, or 18 cents a share, a penny better than
analysts' average forecast, on a 30% jump in sales to $163 million.
The City of Commerce-based retailer's sales at stores open at least a
year climbed 8%.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it plans to continue expanding its chain of
stores by 25% a year and sees annual earnings growth at 20%.</TE>
<TE>   * Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum Co. said net income fell 41% to $7.5
million, or 24 cents a share, in its first quarter ended March 31, as
revenue fell 6% to $405.5 million. The Los Angeles-based company's
operating profit of 21 cents, which excludes a benefit of 3 cents due
to a change in the accounting of goodwill amortization, was in line
with analysts' forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   * Meade Instruments Corp. of Irvine said its net loss narrowed to
$1.8 million, or 12 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, from
a net loss of $4.7 million, or 31 cents, a year ago. Sales declined
28% to $16 million.</TE>

<HD>A Town Traded Away</HD>
<DH>As another factory shuts down, residents of Chilhowie ask,
where are the jobs that globalization is supposed to create?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHILHOWIE, Va.</DL>
<LD>People in this pocket of Appalachia aren't sure what it's like to
work in a Mexican garment factory or an Asian furniture plant. But
they know how it feels to be globalized.</LD>
<LD>   For years, manufacturers flocked to Chilhowie and neighboring
communities because of their abundant supply of loyal, low-cost
workers.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the China of Virginia," said Mike Hopkins, who
supervises production at a local wood products mill.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in a sudden turn of the global screw, plants began shutting
down and moving out. Since 1988, Smyth County has lost 10 big
factories employing 2,075 workers. Five of the plants and 1,430 of
the jobs were in little Chilhowie, population 1,827.</TE>
<TE>   An entire town, in effect, had been traded away.</TE>
<TE>   Chilhowie's experience is a reminder that world commerce can be a
fickle taskmaster. It distributes its bounty and assesses its costs
unevenly, not just among nations but within them.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, activists will take to the streets this weekend to
condemn the effect of globalization on developing countries. In
Chilhowie, people wonder why no one seems to have noticed the effect
it's had on them.</TE>
<TE>   "The economists say that over the long haul, this is going to help
America," said Town Manager Bill Rush. "Over the long haul, that's
fine. But what are we going to do until then? I'm losing another 250
people in 30 days."</TE>
<TE>   But other people in Chilhowie reject the theology of trade.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you can buy a coffee table for $99 doesn't mean
you're going to live well," said Scotty Hopkins, a Chilhowie native
who has bounced between employers since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Chilhowie has lived through several cycles of industrial boom and
bust. Situated in the Great Valley of the Appalachians, near the
point where Virginia bumps up against North Carolina and Tennessee,
its first big employer was Virginia Paving &amp; Sewer Pipe Co., which
shipped its bricks "from Lynchburg to London" until its vein of clay
ran out in 1910. Chilhowie Lumber Co. had its run too, supplying logs
to build the Panama Canal before bankruptcy intervened.</TE>
<TE>   It was not until the early 1970s that Chilhowie began to transform
itself into a thriving industrial town. Local entrepreneurs enticed
makers of furniture, clothing and other goods to set up shop along
Route 11. Before long, Chilhowie was attracting workers from as far
away as Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial boom transformed more than just the landscape. "We
went from one breadwinner in the home to the ladies going to work in
the sewing factories," said Tom Bishop, who operates a home supply
store, a scrap metal business and a wood framing plant in Chilhowie.
With the extra income, families could afford bigger houses, better
cars and other middle-class amenities.</TE>
<TE>   The good times kept rolling through most of the '70s, '80s and
early '90s. Then Chilhowie's world turned upside-down.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement
with Mexico and Canada. U.S. apparel makers soon found themselves
fighting for their lives. Some cut back domestic production; some set
up plants in Mexico, where factory workers get only a fraction of the
wages paid to Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "To be competitive, you had to go south," said Larry Gibbs, who
has managed Spring Ford Industries' knitting mill in Chilhowie since
1988. "I've seen the whole industry go away. It was all based on
cost."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Gibbs kept 450 workers busy assembling millions of
T-shirts for the likes of Reebok International Ltd. and J.C. Penney
Co. But Spring Ford announced last month that foreign competition was
forcing it to go out of business. Today, Gibbs will lay off his 50
remaining workers.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, Chilhowie's biggest employers have shut their doors.
Tultex Corp. closed its 200-worker sweatshirt factory in 1998. The
Buster Brown plant, where 300 people assembled children's clothes,
followed in 1999. Three months ago, Natalie Knitting Mills shuttered
its 350-worker sweater factory. Other mills were shutting down too.
Spring Ford was the latest to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, trade winds began buffeting the furniture industry. When
Congress approved permanent normal trade relations with China in
2000, enabling Beijing to join the World Trade Organization, a tidal
wave swept across the Pacific and headed straight for Smyth County.</TE>
<TE>   The products were different, but the equation was the same.
Furniture industry officials say it costs about $2,000 a month to
keep an American production worker employed. A Chinese factory worker
costs about $100.</TE>
<TE>   In September, American of Martinsville began laying off workers in
Chilhowie, where 450 people built veneered furniture for hotels and
motels. Last week the firm announced it would close the plant and lay
off its 245 remaining workers by mid-June. It blamed competition from
imports and the effect of Sept. 11 on the lodging industry.</TE>
<TE>   President Noel Chitwood acknowledged that U.S. trade policy had
contributed to the firm's decision to scale back U.S. operations and
initiate talks with potential suppliers in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm forced to change the business model at American of
Martinsville to include production from overseas," Chitwood said.
"Unfortunately, the cost of that is eliminating jobs in the United
States. Is it regrettable? Sure it is. Do I understand the greater
good? Not really."</TE>
<TE>   In Chilhowie, the greater good seems unfathomable. How can
Americans be better off when so many people are losing their jobs?
Where are the new jobs that global trade is supposed to create in
this country?</TE>
<TE>   The textbook answer is that layoffs are being offset by job growth
in other parts of the economy, such as service industries. But few of
those jobs are finding their way to Smyth County.</TE>
<TE>   For many apparel workers, the skills they mastered over the years
are of almost no value in today's job market. Most of them qualify
for up to two years of government-paid retraining. But in a county
where almost no one is hiring, retraining offers no guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   For 26 years, Jim Sawyer worked as a sewing machine mechanic at
the Tultex plant. When the company folded four years ago, he signed
up for machinist training. He eventually got a job at the Virginia
Glove factory in nearby Glade Spring. Now, that company is shutting
down too, and Sawyer will begin drawing unemployment again in August.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he's thinking about learning to be an electrician.
"I've got a daughter who will be 14 here before long," said Sawyer,
46. "I told her I'll probably be going to school when she graduates.
We'll just go to college together."</TE>
<TE>   For some people, a plant closing is the end of the line.</TE>
<TE>   Ruby Fields worked for 15 years as an inspector at the Tultex
plant. She applied for other jobs, but got no offers. She has no
health insurance, her pension appears shaky, her unemployment
benefits have run out and her husband is on disability. At 60, she
doesn't think retraining makes much sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm too old to do that," she said. "I don't want to go back to
school and retrain. What would I retrain for?"</TE>
<TE>   This distress is putting pressure on local officials to find new
employers to take the place of those who left. At the top of
everyone's wish list is technology. But it's hard to compete against
the magnetic pull of northern Virginia's bustling high-tech
community, especially in a region where nearly 40% of the work force
didn't finish high school.</TE>
<TE>   "People come up to me on the street and say, 'You ought to be
doing something, you ought to be out recruiting high-tech jobs,'"
said County Administrator Ed Whitmore. "I'm sorry we can't give them
instant results."</TE>
<TE>   At Chilhowie's First Church of God, Pastor Bobby Dunn prays that
his community sees better days ahead, offers solace to the worried
and weary, and wonders why one little town has to suffer so much so
other people can save a few cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful about a lot of things. God is still alive. The Lord
is still with us. He'll see us through our difficult times," Dunn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "About jobs, I'm not so hopeful."</TE>

<HD>Enron Trustee Reviews Banks</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. trustee in Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy case is reviewing a
request to remove Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. from the
committee representing the energy trader's creditors because of an
alleged conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   Exco Resources Inc. told Trustee Carolyn S. Schwartz that the
banks should be disqualified because the committee is responsible for
returning the most money possible to Enron's creditors. That may mean
seeking funds from the banks, which were named in a lawsuit alleging
they helped hide Enron debts and collected fees in the process.</LD>
<LD>   "We would not take a member of the committee off based just on
allegations of a lawsuit if the member is fulfilling its fiduciary
obligation to all creditors," Schwartz's spokeswoman, Jane Limprecht,
said Thursday. "We will be looking to see if that requirement has
been fulfilled."</LD>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan and Citigroup declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors committee, appointed by the trustee in December,
determines how more than $40billion in Enron's debts will be
resolved. Its approval also is needed for any settlement of
$28billion sought by Enron shareholders, bondholders and employees,
who have an inferior status to creditors as Enron claimants.</TE>

<HD>Inland Empire's Hiring Boom</HD>
<DH>Economy: Riverside and San Bernardino counties will lead
state in employment growth in 2002, a forecast says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Inland Empire, long the Rodney Dangerfield of the Southern
California economy, will lead the state in job creation this year,
according to an economic forecast to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   Riverside and San Bernardino counties will see their 2002 nonfarm
payroll employment increase a combined 4.1%, or 42,400 jobs, higher
than any other major metropolitan area in California in terms of both
growth and absolute jobs, according to Inland Empire economist John
Husing, head of Highland-based Economics &amp; Politics Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Lest anyone think the Inland Empire is a flash in the pan,
consider that the area has created the biggest share of jobs in
Southern California over the last decade and outpaced the rest of the
state during the recent economic slowdown. The area is 34,000 jobs
ahead of where it was in March 2001, a 3.3% year-over-year growth
rate that's the highest of any large metro area in California.</LD>
<TE>   "We're continuing to grow even in a slowdown," Husing said. "A lot
of places wish they could say that."</TE>
<TE>   Husing said the region's abundance of relatively low-cost land
combined with a rapidly increasing population are fueling job
creation in the vast region, which stretches east from Southern
California's coastal counties to the borders of Arizona and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Local and national companies have been moving into the region for
years to gain access to huge tracts of undeveloped land. Thus the
area has been a magnet for warehousing and distribution operations in
need of giant parcels, as well as manufacturers looking for room to
stretch their legs. The region has provided firms with ready access
to the huge Los Angeles market at greatly reduced costs when compared
with the coastal counties.</TE>
<TE>   But the Inland Empire's population boom is fueling job creation as
well. Currently home to about 3.3 million people, the Inland Empire
is expected to add 1.8 million residents by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Husing said that growth has created a tremendous need for a
variety of jobs to service the growing population, from store clerks
and gardeners to teachers, police officers and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures from the state Employment Development
Department, San Bernardino and Riverside counties have created
342,300 jobs since 1990--the largest number in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The knock on the Inland Empire's economy is that many of the jobs
it has created are relatively low-wage manufacturing, service and
logistics positions. But even that is changing, albeit slowly, Husing
said.</TE>
<TE>   With housing prices skyrocketing in the coastal counties, high-end
subdivisions are springing up in communities such as Corona, Chino
Hills, Norco and Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   Husing said those developments are attracting white-collar
workers, managers and executives whose jobs currently remain in Los
Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the long term, those people aren't going to want to
commute," Husing said. "Their companies will eventually feel the
pressure from their employees" to join them in the Inland Empire.</TE>

<HD>Markets Recover After Plane Shock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks were mixed Thursday as investors quickly shook off a midday
drop caused by news of a plane crashing into a skyscraper in Milan,
Italy, but couldn't get over a weak financial forecast from telecom
bellwether Nokia.</LD>
<LD>   The market pared losses after Italian officials called the crash
of a small plane into Milan's tallest building an apparent accident.
Reports of the crash, which at first appeared similar to the suicide
attacks that leveled the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, had sparked
a short, sharp market sell-off.</LD>
<LD>   "It was eerie for people to see another news report very similar
to what happened here," said Rick Meckler, head of LibertyView
Capital, located in New Jersey across the Hudson River from the World
Trade site. "It was a little bit too close in terms of news."</LD>
<TE>   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.50
points, or 0.2%, to 10,205.28, after sinking more than 1.6% in the
minutes after the plane crash. The Nasdaq composite closed down 8.24
points, or 0.5%, at 1,802.43, after tumbling almost 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Decliners and advancers were even on the New York Stock Exchange,
and winners outnumbered losers 9 to 8 on Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Jitters fed by the plane crash hit the owners of American and
United, the two largest U.S. airlines. American parent AMR fell 79
cents to $22.86, and United parent UAL lost 55 cents to $14.84. The
S&amp;P airline index closed off 2.6% after diving more than 5%
immediately after the Milan news.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets, Treasury bond yields eased and gold futures
prices edged higher.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger weight on the stock market late in the day was concern
over disappointing earnings reports, analysts said. Nokia, the No. 1
maker of cell phones, fell $2.53 to $18.10 after cutting its
estimates of industry growth this year.</TE>
<TE>   Weakness in such big-name shares as Colgate-Palmolive, which fell
$3.80 to $53.95 on concerns about sales growth, and Honeywell, which
sank $2.16 to $38.30 on fears about asbestos liability, hurt
sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The S&amp;P semiconductor equipment index sank 3.1%. KLA- Tencor
lost $3.05 to $65.61 after giving a weaker-than-expected forecast for
orders. The news dashed some of the recent optimism about a
turnaround in the chip sector.</TE>
<TE>   * ExpressJet Holdings was unchanged at $16 as the biggest
first-time stock offering by a U.S. airline since at least 1990 had
an unimpressive debut. Investors are worried about the prospects for
Continental Airlines, which still owns a controlling stake in
ExpressJet. Continental fell $1.41 to $28.20. JetBlue Airways fell 90
cents to $44.20. Shares of JetBlue soared 66% in their first day of
trading last week--the best performance by an IPO in almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Trimeris, a small biotech firm, soared $11.25, or nearly 29%, to
$50.50 on positive results from pivotal human tests on its
experimental AIDS drug, which could help patients resistant to
currently available treatments. Trimeris is co-developing the drug,
dubbed T-20, along with the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss health-care
giant Roche, which rose 60 cents to $76.40 in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Adelphia Communications eased 19 cents to $7.06. After regular
trading ended the troubled cable TV firm said Nasdaq may delist its
shares because of the company's delay in filing financial documents.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's rose $1.46 to $28.62 after the restaurant giant said
it expected higher sales in the U.S. and Europe this year.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Posts Wider Loss on Charge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy company, reported a wider net
loss Thursday as it took a big charge for the purchase of American
Girl dolls.</LD>
<LD>   The company's stock, however, rose on news that revenue climbed,
margins improved and operating earnings beat expectations.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo-based maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars
said its first-quarter net loss widened to $256.2 million, or 59
cents a share, from last year's loss of $34 million, or 8 cents a
share. This year's first-quarter figure includes a $252.2-million
charge based on a change in accounting procedures, writing down
goodwill from the $700-million 1998 purchase of Pleasant Co., the
maker of American Girl dolls.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding the charge and other special items, Mattel beat
estimates with a profit of $10.2 million, or 2 cents a share,
contrasted with a year-earlier loss of $3.8 million, or 1 cent a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call estimated an
average loss of 1 cent a share.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Bob Eckert said he generally was pleased with the
results.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Mattel rallied on the news, gaining 90 cents, or 4.5%,
to $20.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel's sales rose to $742 million from $715.2 million a year
earlier. Gross sales fell 1% in the United States, but rose
internationally by 16%, or 20% with the effect of currency exchange
rates.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Lynch to Widen Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Finance: Firm will share more information about potential
conflicts in research. But broader reform issues remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed Thursday to give investors new details
about conflicts of interest that threaten the objectivity of its
stock analysts. But the firm still must settle with regulators on
broader issues involving its research practices.</LD>
<LD>   The big brokerage consented to disclosure changes to satisfy a
legal action brought last week by New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer, who charged that Merrill's stock research is compromised by
conflicts with its investment-banking business.</LD>
<LD>   A New York state Supreme Court judge had given Merrill until today
to enact a new policy.</LD>
<TE>   In a report last week, Spitzer charged that Merrill's
Internet-industry analysts in 2000 and 2001 routinely doubted the
validity of their own stock touts and admitted talking up stocks
simply to bring in investment-banking work.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's deal with Spitzer calls for the brokerage to begin
divulging on a Web site by next week any investment-banking work done
in the last 12 months for companies reviewed by its analysts.</TE>
<TE>   By June 3, the firm must prominently include in individual
research reports information about potential banking conflicts of
interest. By that date the brokerage also will provide a breakdown of
how it rates stocks for performance over the coming 12 months--for
example, the percentage of "buy" ratings versus "sell" ratings. One
of Spitzer's criticisms is that Merrill never rated Net stocks
"sell," even as prices plunged.</TE>
<TE>   "These disclosures are necessary to inform consumers and investors
of the inherent conflicts of interest at Merrill Lynch," Spitzer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill said the new disclosure policy "far exceeds the current
industry standard."</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer said that "serious issues remain to be resolved." The
two sides are holding intensive negotiations on a possible admission
of wrongdoing by Merrill, the size of any fine it would pay and the
steps that would be taken to insulate research from banking, a source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Talks have focused largely on the separation of research and
banking, with lesser attention given thus far to the other issues,
the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The Merrill case has riveted Wall Street because its outcome is
expected to serve as a framework for industrywide reform. Spitzer
recently subpoenaed documents from other major brokerages, broadening
his probe.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is watching this pretty closely, because whatever
happens in this situation will have an impact in shaping what happens
at brokerages nationwide," said Henry Hu, a securities-law expert.</TE>

<HD>Merck Earnings Decline as Generics Squeeze Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merck &amp; Co., once a juggernaut among pharmaceutical companies,
announced its first decline in quarterly earnings in nearly nine
years Thursday, a day after Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
released disappointing forecasts for 2002. Schering-Plough Corp.
reported increased profit on rising sales of hepatitis medications.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, pressure on drug industry profits intensified as AARP,
an advocacy group for Americans age 55 and older, said it began a
national campaign to urge its 35million members to use generic drugs
more often and be wary of ads for brand-name medicines.</LD>
<LD>   The group said it will spend $10million on television and print
ads telling consumers that generic medicines, which are usually less
expensive, may work as well as more expensive brand-name drugs. The
ads also warn patients not to "let advertising sell you on drugs you
don't need."</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the industry's worsening profit outlook reflects the
fact that the drug business, despite its good long-term fundamentals,
remains cyclical and that its peaks and troughs have become more
extreme in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, analysts predict huge growth in pharmaceutical sales
as the nation's enormous baby boomer generation ages and seeks ways
to remain active.</TE>
<TE>   "New products are the lifeblood of the industry, which is prone to
cycles," said Viren Mehta, managing member of Mehta Partners in New
York. "Pfizer, Novartis, Pharmacia and others like them have products
that are in a growth phase. Merck, Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers
Squibb at the moment are in a down cycle."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta added that no pharmaceutical company has managed to avoid
the cycle of highs and lows.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter net income for Merck, the nation's second-largest
drug maker, fell 1.9% to $1.63 billion from $1.66 billion. Earnings
per share remained at 71 cents. Sales rose 7.3% to $12.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales for the Whitehaven, N.J., firm rose on the strength
of its Zocor cholesterol drug and Vioxx painkiller, they were not
nearly enough to make up for the falloff in earnings for former
blockbuster drugs such as heartburn drug Pepcid that now face steep
competition from generics.</TE>
<TE>   The news for Schering-Plough was somewhat better as net income
climbed 6.4% to $600 million, or 41 cents a share, from $564 million,
or 38 cents, a year earlier, as sales increased 11% to $2.56 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Share prices for both companies improved Thursday, but Merck and
Schering-Plough's stock prices are still down 29% and 21%,
respectively, over the last year. Merck rose $1.52 to $56.57, and
Schering-Plough rose $1.28 to $30.54, both on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer, the largest U.S. drug maker, reported Wednesday that
surging sales of key drugs Lipitor and Viagra boosted first-quarter
profit 22%, but it cautioned against expectation of double-digit
growth for the rest of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Rising costs have hit the industry hard, experts said. But more
important, generics now exact a much greater and quicker toll on the
earnings of companies that depend on patented drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Previously, you could assume that 50% of revenues would be lost
to generic competition after a drug went off patent. Now, we are
seeing 90% losses," said Trevor Polischuk, a pharmaceutical industry
analyst for Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Polischuk said that 10 to 15 years ago a blockbuster drug might
have brought in $750 million over its life, but that revenue streams
have become so great for drugs such as Claritin (about $3 billion)
and Prilosec (about $6 billion) that the financial effect is that
much greater when patents expire.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for the industry, however, is that it is headed
toward "a whole mess of good news--and bad news for the payers as
money spent on pharmaceuticals should double in the next five to six
years," said Mike Jacobs of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
"Someone has to pay for it."</TE>

<HD>Telecom Roiled by Sales Gloom</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Stocks fall on lowered forecasts and new job
cuts by Nokia, SBC, Qwest and Nortel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gloomy news from four major companies drove down telecommunications
stocks Thursday, as leading players in the wireless, service and
equipment sectors all reported or projected disappointing sales.</LD>
<LD>   The pessimistic reports from cell phone giant Nokia, local phone
and wireless powerhouse SBC Communications Inc., local and
long-distance provider Qwest Communications International Inc. and
equipment supplier Nortel Networks Corp. reflect the lingering
malaise in an industry suffering from too much capital investment and
weaker-than-expected demand for new services.</LD>
<LD>   SBC, Qwest and Nortel announced plans to cut thousands of jobs to
bolster earnings in the face of stagnating sales, and Nokia said it
would eliminate 625 jobs at its Texas manufacturing plant. Qwest
reportedly is in talks to unload its Yellow Pages service, a cash cow
that could fetch up to $9 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody is suffering from price erosion and excess capac- ity
in some form. And that has a ripple effect," said Roger Wery, a
partner at PRTM, a telecommunications consulting firm in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's news pushed the Amex North American Telecommunications
Index of telecom stocks down 2%.</TE>
<TE>   The industry may not make a meaningful recovery until 2004, said
analyst Alex Mou of research firm Hotovec Pomeranz &amp; Co. in San
Francisco. The intertwined fortunes of telecom equipment and service
companies have been a minefield for investors, he said, and "not all
the bombs have been detonated yet."</TE>
<TE>   The first warning Thursday came from Finland, where Nokia, the
world's top maker of cell phones, cut its sales forecasts for the
full year. The company predicted that sales would grow 4% to 9% over
those of 2001, after previously forecasting 15% growth.</TE>
<TE>   The changed forecast overshadowed better-than-expected
first-quarter profit. Although revenue from mobile phones and network
equipment fell 7% and 29%, respectively, the company still earned
0.19 euros a share, excluding acquisition-related and other special
charges.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Nokia's shares fell 12% to close
at $18.10.</TE>
<TE>   SBC, the second-largest local phone company in the U.S., reported
a loss of $81 million, or 2 cents a share--its first quarterly loss
in almost five years. The deficit stemmed largely from the declining
value of Sterling Commerce, an e-commerce software and services
company it acquired. Excluding those costs, the company said it would
have shown a profit of 51 cents a share, in line with analysts'
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the company announced that it would cut 8,000 jobs,
or 4% of its work force, this year, as well as trim capital spending
an undisclosed amount.</TE>
<TE>   The company's previous forecast called for a 1% to 3% increase in
sales for the year. On Thursday, however, the firm said it would be
"challenging" to meet that target.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the San Antonio-based company fell 61 cents, or 1.8%, to
$33.89 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest, which has cut its forecasts several times in the last six
months, warned investors again Thursday that its results for 2002
would miss expectations. The company, the dominant provider of local
phone lines in 14 Western states but an underdog in the long-distance
business, said it expected $18 billion to $18.4 billion in revenue,
down from its previous forecast of $19.4 billion to $19.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Denver-based company also said it planned to eliminate 2,000
jobs by September, in addition to the 7,000 job cuts it announced
four months ago. It blamed the lower forecasts on "continuing
weakness in both the telecommunications sector and the regional
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Qwest fell 33 cents, or 4%, to $7.57, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto-based Nortel, the No. 2 manufacturer of telecommunication
equipment in North America, reported that first-quarter sales were
49% lower than those of a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2.91
billion, down from $5.75 billion in the same quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel showed a narrower loss of $841 million, or 26 cents a
share, largely because the company took a $1.6-billion charge in 2001
to reflect the diminished value of acquired assets.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing its efforts to cut costs, the company announced that it
would eliminate 3,000 more jobs, or 6.4% of its work force. Nortel's
shares closed at $4.04, down 12 cents, or 3%, in New York.</TE>

<HD>Polaroid Agrees to Unload Most Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Polaroid Corp., the landmark company that pioneered instant
photography in the pre-digital era, has tentatively agreed to sell
most of its assets for $265 million in a bid to recover from
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Polaroid announced Thursday that it had reached an agreement with
a group of investors led by One Equity Partners, the private equity
arm of Bank One Corp. The price represents less than 15% of the value
of Polaroid's assets when the company filed for Chapter 11 protection
in October.</LD>
<LD>   The offer, which must be approved by federal regulators and U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, could still be matched by other suitors.</LD>
<TE>   Polaroid said the deal would enable the company to launch new
products, including kiosk printers that could be used by digital
camera owners to make high-quality, 35-millimeter film prints. In the
meantime, the company plans to keep making its current products,
including the I-Zone, OneStep, JoyCam and Spectra cameras plus the
films they use, spokesman Skip Colcord said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the One Equity deal could keep a legendary brand alive,
it probably would not provide any "recovery for the company's
stockholders," according to a Polaroid news release. Polaroid
shares--which traded above $6 in May and $60 in 1997--are now worth
less than a dime. The company was delisted from the New York Stock
Exchange in October.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fire sale of the worst sort," said Ulysses Yannas, an
analyst for Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Objections to the deal emerged immediately from a retiree group
that has been battling Polaroid management over losing benefits just
days before the company's bankruptcy filing. "The offer seems low. I
can understand and appreciate no one will pay top dollar for Polaroid
at this point," said Al Gray, a lawyer who represents Polaroid
retirees. "But it seems extremely low."</TE>
<TE>   A financial analyst who follows Bank One said it would be hard to
assess the deal without knowing how Polaroid's debt--nearly $1
billion--would be restructured. But Daniel Hilder of Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co. said the company name alone is valuable: "Polaroid is clearly a
national brand name and an American icon." Polaroid, which produced
its first instant film camera in 1948, was largely left behind as
digital cameras that took pictures without film came into vogue in
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But company executives maintain that their film technology,
protected by more than 800 active patents, is still valuable.</TE>
<TE>   The company's inexpensive I-Zone camera aimed mostly at the
teenage market became the best-selling camera in the world shortly
after it was introduced in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember a time when a Polaroid might cost $100 or $200," said
Frank Ponder, chief executive of Bel Air Camera Superstore. "Now you
can get a Polaroid for $14."</TE>

<LD>Microsoft Corp. expects to ship 3.5 million to 4 million Xbox video
consoles by the end of June, a drastic scaling back of previous
expectations of 4.5 million to 6 million units, Chief Financial
Officer John Connors said.</LD>
<LD>   The revised expectations stem from weak sales in Japan and Europe
of the new gaming machine, which is taking on Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Co.'s GameCube.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft also said it is cutting the price of the Xbox in Europe
by 38% and in Britain by 34% to shore up sagging sales.</LD>

<LD>* Boeing Co., hurt by a slowdown in the market for commercial
satellites, said it has begun a second round of job cuts at its
satellite-making unit in El Segundo, slashing 800 positions on top of
the 1,050 that it had announced in February. The unit warned
employees that it would have to eliminate an additional 500 jobs by
year-end if market conditions don't improve. That would bring the
total number of job cuts to 2,350, or about 25% of Boeing's satellite
work force.</LD>
<LD>   * Boeing Co., Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd.'s SkyBridge
venture and four other communications companies won approval from the
Federal Communications Commission to offer high-speed Internet access
through a new kind of satellite service.</LD>
<LD>   * Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media company,
sold a French publisher of trade magazines for $1 billion, raising
about half the amount it initially sought. Vivendi, which is selling
the business to buyout firms Cinven Ltd., Carlyle Group Inc. and Apax
Partners, was forced to cut the price of the unit because of a drop
in the ad market. * Billionaire Ron Burkle, one of Kmart Corp.'s
biggest investors, asked a Bankruptcy Court judge to order the
appointment of a panel of shareholders to give them a formal voice in
the retailer's Chapter 11 case.</LD>
<TE>   * United Parcel Service Inc. said first-quarter profit fell 3.3%
to $563 million, or 50 cents a share, as sales edged up 1.9% to $7.58
billion.</TE>
<TE>   * PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. said it would cut $897 million
from the value of its assets in the first quarter, joining a long
list of companies moving to comply with stricter accounting
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana-based health insurer said the one-time charge will
increase earnings by $56 million, or $1.60 a share, for the full year
as related amortization costs are taken away.</TE>
<TE>   * Walt Disney Co. said it will reopen its 1,008-room Port Orleans

<DL></DL>
<LD>A key gauge of U.S. economic activity edged up last month but a more
recent measure of new claims for unemployment benefits ticked higher,
suggesting an economy struggling to make its way out of recession.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board reported its index of leading economic
indicators inched up 0.1% last month to 112.3 after holding steady in
February. Analysts had forecast a 0.3% gain.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, new claims for jobless benefits edged up by a
seasonally adjusted 1,000 to 445,000 for the work week ending April
13, the Labor Department reported. The four-week moving average of
new claims, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, also rose
last week to 448,750, the highest level since mid-November.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages fell to 6.94% this week, down from 6.99% the previous week,
Freddie Mac said. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for
refinancing, slipped to 6.42%, down from 6.49% the week before. A
year ago, 15-year mortgages averaged 6.66%.</TE>

changes and costs to remodel Canadian stores.</LD>
<LD>   But the retailer's operating profit doubled to $300 million, or 93

<LD>Imports to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach fell in March as
U.S. shoppers reduced spending on retail items from furniture to
clothing to automobiles.</LD>
<LD>   Combined shipments into the two largest U.S. ports fell 3% last
month to 390,500 20-foot-long containers from 402,400 in March 2001.
Exports rose 4.6% to 180,500 containers.</LD>
<LD>   "Demand is getting stronger, but it's still erratic," said Art
Wong, a spokesman for the Port of Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Shipments from Long Beach rose 4.1% to 87,800 containers,
preliminary data showed. Exports from Los Angeles rose 5% to 92,700
containers.</TE>
<TE>   Imports to Long Beach slumped 12.1%, while imports through Los
Angeles rose 5.8%. The number of empty containers shipped from Long
Beach rose 4.4%, while exports of empties from Los Angeles jumped
17%.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. reported a 33% decline in first-quarter net income
to $253.1 million, or 20 cents a share, reflecting the sluggish
global economy and a mad-cow scare that has hurt sales in Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-food chain said its operating profit of 31 cents a share
beat Wall Street's lowered expectations by 2 cents, however, citing a
resurgence of sales in Europe, where consumers also had been wary of
beef safety for months.</LD>
<LD>   The company also said it expects to beat Wall Street's full-year
earnings estimate of $1.46. Revenue rose 2% to $3.6 billion.</LD>

<LD>A software executive defending Microsoft Corp. against antitrust
penalties said Microsoft blindsided his company by dropping support
for a computer language critical to one of its products.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Borduin, vice president of Autodesk--maker of the
architectural design program AutoCAD-- testified in federal court
that antitrust penalties proposed by the nine states, including ones
that would require Microsoft's disclosure of technical information,
are unnecessary and would damage the software community.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for the states countered by releasing an e-mail in which
Borduin harshly criticized Microsoft for dropping support for the
Java programming language in its latest operating system, Windows XP.
Java is used in Autodesk products.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., the second-biggest U.S.
cigarette maker, had a first-quarter loss because of a decline in the
value of some trademarks acquired during its leveraged buyout.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of $335 million, or $3.58 a share, contrasted with net
income of $100 million, or 98 cents, a year earlier, the maker of
Camel and Winston cigarettes said. Write-downs for the trademarks
because of an accounting change boosted expenses by $502 million, or
$5.37 a share. Revenue increased 4% to $1.52 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Some of R.J. Reynolds' brands, such as Winston, have lost value
since a leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in 1989. Excluding the cost of writing down the
brands, R.J. Reynolds would have had a profit of $167 million, or
$1.79 a share, beating estimates.</LD>

<HD>Microsoft Says 2003 Profit to Miss Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Earnings roundup: EBay says first-quarter net income more
than doubles. EMC, Emulex and Gateway post losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said Thursday that fiscal third-quarter profit rose
nearly 12% but missed Wall Street's expectations, and warned that
profit in fiscal 2003 won't meet forecasts. The news caused the
biggest software company's stock to slump in after-hours trading.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft reported a profit of $2.74 billion, or 49 cents a share,
compared with $2.45 billion, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had predicted 51
cents a share. The results included an $847-million after-tax gain,
or 15 cents a share, on the sale of its online travel service
Expedia. Revenue rose 15% to $7.25 billion.</LD>
<LD>   For fiscal 2003, which begins July 1, the company said earnings
per share will be lower than the Thomson Financial/First Call
estimate of $1.87 a share on revenue of $28.9 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft's senior executives have decided to spend heavily--$800
million--next year on research and development and long-term
projects, including the Xbox game system and MSN Internet service.
Microsoft, which lost 26 cents to $56.37 in the regular session on
Nasdaq, fell to $54.89 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings news Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * EBay Inc. said first-quarter earnings more than doubled on
sharply higher sales, but its shares fell on concerns that the strong
growth rate of the company's popular online auction site may be
slowing. The San Jose-based online auctioneer, which has steadily
expanded into new product categories from high-end art to real
estate, reported a first-quarter profit of $47.6 million, or 17 cents
a share, compared with $21.1 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   On an operating basis, excluding unusual costs, the company said
it earned 18 cents a share in the quarter. Most analysts had been
forecasting operating earnings of 16 cents a share. EBay's revenue
grew to $245.1 million from $154.1million. The company said it
remains confident that second-quarter and full-year earnings will
surpass or come in at the high end of its previous guidance. EBay
shares, which fell 3.4%, or $1.89, to $53.04 a share in regular
Nasdaq trading, fell to about $50.50 in after-hours trading. The
company said revenue from third-party advertisers represented about
8% of total revenue, down from 13% in the fourth quarter of last
year.</TE>
<TE>   * Gateway Inc. reported a loss and shrinking revenue in the first
quarter as the Poway, Calif., maker of personal computers retrenched
against a backdrop of weak demand and stiff competition. Gateway lost
$123 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $502.9
million, or $1.56 a share, a year earlier, as the company began a
restructuring that eventually included closing foreign operations and
downsizing in the United States. The results were in line with
analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at the company, which has responded with price breaks and
package deals to market leader Dell Computer Corp.'s rising interest
in the home computer market, were $992 million after $2.03 billion a
year ago. Gateway sold 645,000 units in the U.S., down 30% from a
year ago, and down 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. The
company maintained its full-year loss guidance of a range of
$200million to $250million, or 39 cents to 49 cents a share. It
expects revenue to be in the range of $4.5billion to $5billion.
Gateway shares fell 9 cents to $6.20 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   * Compaq Computer Corp., which soon could become part of rival
Hewlett-Packard Co., reported a first-quarter profit of $44million,
or 3 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $131 million, or 8
cents a share, in the first quarter of 2001. The results were
slightly higher than analysts' expectations. The year-ago results
were adjusted to reflect a $222-million charge required by a change
in accounting standards. Revenue fell 16% to $7.7 billion. Compaq
shares gained 14 cents, or 1.3%, to close at $10.82 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Sun Microsystems Inc. posted a slim fiscal third-quarter loss of
$26 million, or 1 cent a share, that beat Wall Street expectations by
a penny. The Palo Alto network equipment maker earned $136 million,
or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Sun, facing slumping demand for
high-powered network servers and workstations, said sales fell 24%
from a year earlier, to $3.1 billion. Sun shares rose 29 cents to
$8.52 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * EMC Corp., the largest maker of computer storage products,
posted its third consecutive quarterly loss, of $76.9 million, or 3
cents a share. In the year-ago first quarter, the Massachusetts
company posted a profit of $398.8 million, or 18 cents a share. Sales
fell 44% to $1.30 billion. EMC closed up 60 cents to $11 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Emulex Corp., a Costa Mesa supplier of computer storage
networking products, reported a net loss of $16.5 million, or 20
cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter, compared with a net loss
of $24.5million, or 32 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
Revenue for the three months ended March 31 grew 15% to $69.6million.
Emulex shares rose $1.01 to $29.91 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Satellite Contract Awarded to TRW</HD>
<DH>Defense: The company will be the prime contractor for a
$6-billion network that tracks enemy missiles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. said Thursday that its space and electronics unit in Redondo
Beach has been picked to oversee development of a satellite-based
ballistic missile tracking system that is expected to cost at least
$6 billion over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   TRW was named the prime contractor for the Pentagon's Space Based
Infrared System Low program, with responsibility to build a
constellation of satellites that would be able to track enemy
intercontinental ballistic missiles.</LD>
<LD>   TRW said it signed an initial contract worth $665 million with the
Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency. The agency has forwarded a budget
request of $3.63 billion to Congress for the program for fiscal years
2003 through 2007. The system, which could include up to 24
satellites, is expected to eventually cost more than $6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The program is a key component of the nation's missile defense
effort, and the latest decision reinforces the region's continuing
dominance in the research and development of missile defense
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's role in several major elements of missile defense is a key
reason Northrop Grumman Corp. launched a $6.7-billion hostile bid for
the company.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's selection of a prime contractor is part of a
broader effort to streamline the program, which has been under
scrutiny for cost overruns and schedule delays. Before the
reorganization, TRW and Raytheon Co.'s electronic unit in El Segundo
were competing against Gilbert, Ariz.-based Spectrum Astro Inc. and
Century City-based Northrop to build the system, but now all of them
will be involved in some way with TRW having oversight authority.</TE>
<TE>   TRW officials said it had not decided on the roles for the
subcontractors, although Raytheon and Northrop will continue to
compete on developing infrared sensors for satellites. Meanwhile,
Northrop's fight to acquire TRW moved into court as a U.S. federal
judge issued a temporary restraining order delaying a key TRW
shareholders meeting Monday to determine whether Northrop could
proceed with its bid. The judge said shareholders should have more
time to digest a sweetened offer and moved the meeting to May 3.</TE>

<HD>UH Says 1st-Quarter Net Income Rose 39%</HD>
<DH>Insurance: UnitedHealth Group beats forecasts as it adds
customers, trims medical spending and raises premiums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UnitedHealth Group Inc., the biggest U.S. health insurer, said
first-quarter profit rose 39% as it added customers at big employers,
raised premiums and controlled medical spending.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $295 million, or 92 cents a share, from $212
million, or 64 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue rose
5.9% to $6.01 billion.</LD>
<LD>   UnitedHealth, which passed rival Aetna Inc. this year to become
the biggest health insurer in the U.S., has gained customers in plans
it manages for self-insured businesses. The insurer also increased
premiums faster than medical costs rose and has worked with doctors
to curb costs for patients with conditions such as stroke and
diabetes.</LD>
<TE>   The company was expected to earn 85 cents, the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Minnetonka, Minn.-based UnitedHealth rose $4.69, or
5.9%, to $84.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   UnitedHealth raised its 2002 earnings forecast to $3.84 to $3.86 a
share, up from the $3.07 a share it earned last year. Analysts had
expected profit of $3.65. Earnings are expected to rise at least 15%
in 2003 and 2004, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   The company said membership rose to 17.1 million in the quarter
from 16.5 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums probably will rise about 16% this year, though employers
will cut benefits or raise the amount workers pay for things such as
drugs and doctor visits to limit the increase to 13%, Chief Executive
William McGuire said.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire said costs probably will rise about 12%, driven by
increases for prescription drugs, hospital care, lab tests and
medical specialties such as gastroenterology.</TE>
<TE>   UnitedHealth restructured in 1998 after its plan to buy rival
Humana Inc. collapsed. The company in 1999 became the first health
maintenance organization to stop requiring patients to get medical
care authorized before seeing a doctor, gaining it some advantage in
the HMO market.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has cut hospital costs for patients with
conditions such as heart problems, stroke and diabetes by working
with physicians to improve care.</TE>
<TE>   UnitedHealth has focused on self-funded customers at big employers
and mid-sized firms as rivals Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc. struggle.
Cigna is moving customers to a new computer system, causing some
service problems, and Aetna has raised rates and canceled
unprofitable accounts to battle rising medical costs.</TE>
<TE>   "They're capitalizing on the weakness of others, but they'll face
more competition for that business," France said. "Everybody wants to

<HD>Volcker Hits Hurdles in Bid to Rescue Andersen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Efforts by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker to save
accounting firm Arthur Andersen by transforming it into a smaller
audit-oriented business have been stymied by dissent within the firm,
according to people familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Consulting partners, who would have to find new work under
Volcker's plan, have withheld support, as have partners who have lost
major clients and have little stake in a revived firm.</LD>
<LD>   That has resulted in a series of conflicting signals. Although
Andersen's leadership has said it supports Volcker's plan, key
executives have either overtly or tacitly agreed to deals by
individual offices to merge with other firms, people familiar with
the situation say.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear that the passage of time has made all of this much
more difficult," Volcker said Thursday. "When I announced a
willingness to take a leading role at Andersen a month ago, I said we
needed action on a variety of issues in days, not months."</TE>
<TE>   Volcker offered to take control of Andersen on March 22, following
the firm's criminal indictment. Andersen's partners approved the plan
a week later, after the resignation of Joseph F. Berardino, the
firm's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Heading Volcker's list of actions was reaching an agreement with
the Justice Department to suspend or defer its prosecution, an action
that looks increasingly remote with the collapse of talks Thursday. A
trial is scheduled to start May 6.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen had hoped the Justice Department would defer prosecution
of the firm for destroying documents sought in the probe of its
accounting work for Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker also sought a quick settlement of class-action lawsuits
filed by Enron employees and investors against the firm. But serious
talks on that front broke off Wednesday, and people familiar with the
cases say they expect no movement until July.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker, who did not take an active role in either the criminal or
civil negotiations, said he still believes that his vision of an
audit-oriented firm remains a worthy goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at all the problems of which Arthur Andersen has become a
poster child for the industry but the other firms have been far from
exempt," he said. "The profession has a clear public responsibility
and it needs to discharge that with a minimum of conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   He plans to let the Andersen drama play out and see what's left to
work with.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no particular need for me to make a decision or set a
deadline," Volcker said.</TE>
<TE>   "A decision will make itself when we see if the firm is strong
enough to go on."</TE>

<HD>Yodeler Tells Yahoo: I'll Sue You-Hooo!</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A cowboy-singer-poet from a town called Dusty is accusing Internet
giant Yahoo Inc. in a lawsuit of rustling his signature vocalization
in thousands of commercials.</LD>
<LD>   Wylie Gustafson, who was paid $590 to record the "ya-hooo" six
years ago, says the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based global network owes him
$5 million for poaching his yodel.</LD>
<LD>   "All I know is I created this yodel and it's become an audio
trademark for this company, and that wasn't the original agreement,"
Gustafson, 40, said Thursday in a telephone interview from his ranch
in eastern Washington, near the town of Dusty, population 12.</LD>
<TE>   "They totally ignored the fact that it is a creation and it's a
copyrighted thing," he said. "They just ran with it....Getting taken
advantage of is part of the business. But this is way beyond the
scope of what I consider fair."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Yahoo declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although the copyright issues appear to be garden variety,
Gustafson's attempt to collect on a yodel may be a first, lawyers
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never heard of that one before," said Jay L. Cooper, a Los
Angeles entertainment lawyer who represents actor Jerry Seinfeld and
singer Sheryl Crow. "Usually copyright infringement is on scripts or
songs or literary properties of one sort or other."</TE>
<TE>   But, said New York lawyer Peter Toren, "there is no reason you
could not copyright a yodel."</TE>
<TE>   The bigger question, lawyers said, is whether a yodel is worth $5
million.</TE>
<TE>   "The $5 million is just an estimate," said Larry C. Russ,
Gustafson's Los Angeles lawyer. The commercials "have aired thousands
of times, and there is a value to that."</TE>
<TE>   The work of Gustafson, one of a handful of professional yodelers
in the U.S., was big with advertisers in the 1990s. His yodels were
featured in commercials for Porsche, Honda, Taco Bell, Miller Light
and Sprint, all of which paid actors union rates for the performance
and residuals for each airing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Gustafson was asked to yodel for an Internet start-up in
1996, he said, he agreed to do it for $590, less than the union rate.</TE>
<TE>   "They were still a small, starving company," he said. "They didn't
have a lot of money for their commercials, and I understood."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial aired, Gustafson said, and he thought that was the
end of it. But three years later, Gustafson heard his yodel on a new
Yahoo commercial that aired during the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He said he complained to the production company that he had not
given his permission for the yodel to be used in subsequent
commercials, and he got another $590 check.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson describes his life on his Web site as "ropin',
wranglin', writin' and recordin'." He says he would have been happy
to leave out litigatin', but he kept hearing his yodel. He filed suit
this week after Yahoo failed to answer letters.</TE>

<LD>Can the Avengers become a legitimate Arena Football League playoff
contender?</LD>
<LD>   Can they become a profitable franchise in a city that won't give
the NFL the time of day?</LD>
<LD>   Most important, can they make their points on the field?</LD>
<TE>   These are some of the questions facing the third-year team as it
begins the regular season tonight at Staples Center against the New
York Dragons.</TE>
<TE>   With a total of eight victories in their first two seasons, the
Avengers again are making changes.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Hodgkiss, former offensive coordinator for the Indiana
Firebirds, will be the third Avenger coach in a year. Stan Brock was
fired after an 0-3 start last season--and an overall 3-14 record.
Interim coach Robert Lyles, who led the team to five victories in the
final 11 games, is now coaching the Georgia Force.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss, a first-time head coach, is regarded as one of the
league's top offensive thinkers. That reputation will be tested with
a team that last season scored the second-fewest points, 564, and
ranked 17th among 19 teams in total offense with an average of 245.6
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the chance to work with some great coaches and I think
they've prepared me well," Hodgkiss said. "And my staff is making my
transition a smooth one."</TE>
<TE>   Team owner Casey Wasserman said he would give Hodgkiss time to
develop the team. But he also expects to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Stan had time to build the team, but he didn't deliver,"
Wasserman said. "We had 17 games under him and I didn't see any
improvement from Game 1 to Game 17 that would warrant me giving him
Game 20 or Game 24.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Lyles was a breath of fresh air and the team rallied. But
what I didn't see on the field was [not] necessarily attributed to
Robert; it was a lot of leftover stuff from Stan. We felt we needed a
completely fresh start and I'm very happy Robert got the opportunity
with Georgia."</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss has overhauled the roster; there are 12 new faces on the
24-man squad.</TE>
<TE>   Among the departed are quarterbacks Erik Wilhelm, who clashed with
the coaches on the offense, and Todd Marinovich, who for two years
teased the Avengers with his ability and tormented them with
self-destructive behavior, including heroin use.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgkiss will turn to Tony Graziani as the next quarterback.
Graziani was signed late last season, when Wilhelm and Marinovich
were injured, and played two games. He completed 23 of 37 passes for
362 yards and seven touchdowns, with one interception, before
injuring a ligament in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Key returning players include wide receiver Chris Jackson, who
caught 62 passes for 775 yards and 13 touchdowns in nine games, and
defensive back Mark Ricks, who earned All-Arena honors with eight
interceptions--two for touchdowns--and 15 pass deflections.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the team is ready to reach .500 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches have brought in new players and a new attitude," he
said. "I love what I'm seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Other Avenger veterans agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "[Hodgkiss] brought a lot of organization to the team,"
receiver-defensive back Anthony Rice said. "The practices have gone
smoothly, and they haven't been too hard on our bodies the way [they
were] my first two years here. And he's brought in a lot of good
receivers. We're definitely going to score some points this year."</TE>
<TE>   Said Graziani, who is signed through 2004: "I feel a lot better
than last year. Hodgkiss has made things so much easier for the
offense."</TE>
<TE>   The Avengers believe the offense will be bolstered by two recently
signed free agents, wide receiver-linebacker Greg Hopkins and
fullback-linebacker Chad Dukes. Both played for Hodgkiss with the
Firebirds.</TE>

<TE>   Update--New York won its last four regular-season games to make
the playoffs. But this season the Dragons are without 2001 offensive
player of the year Aaron Garcia; the quarterback has signed with the
San Francisco 49ers. Former University of Redlands quarterback Danny
Ragsdale, who played in two games last season, gets his first start.
Besides trying to win his head coaching debut, Ed Hodgkiss wants the
Avengers--the league's most penalized team last year--to play
smarter. "We don't want to beat ourselves. That's our mantra for the
year," he said.</TE>

<LD>The eight fillies and mares entered in tonight's $27,150 Miss
Princess Handicap certainly know where the wire is.</LD>
<LD>   Between them, the ladies, ages 3 to 6, have won 37 races from 133
starts.</LD>
<LD>   The best win percentage among the scheduled participants in the
350-yard race belongs to Seperate Lanes.</LD>
<TE>   A 3-year-old daughter of Lanes Leinster bred in Utah, Seperate
Lanes has won five of seven. After winning four races in Idaho and
Wyoming, she made a successful debut at Los Alamitos on March 29. The
7-5 favorite in her first for trainer Blane Schvaneveldt, Seperate
Lanes, who is owned by Ron Hurst, won by a half-length under Alex
Bautista at tonight's distance. A win by Seperate Lanes or A Diamond
Legacy in the race will be Schvaneveldt's 350th stakes victory at Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Grass Bounce is the richest of the Miss Princess entrants.

mare has banked almost $235,000 while winning five of 20. She will be
ridden by Sam Thompson as she makes her first start since finishing
eighth in the Los Alamitos Derby on Nov. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Lotta Lane. 2. Legal Thief. 3. Crashin Bac. 4.
Virbahn. 5. War And Remembrance. 6. Kissing Cobra. 7. Heza New High.
8. Texas Classy. 9. Seperate Lanes. 10. Fine Wines.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the first, let's use Lotta Lanes, Adrianna Signature and
Chicks Wicked Six, single Legal Thief in the second, use Crashin Bac,
Highly Rated and Little County Weeds in the third and Virbahn,
Flashforward and Tiki Volcano in the fourth. Total cost: $27.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Watch Tower had a rough trip April 7 and could
make amends in the sixth. Pure Cool needed 15 starts to break his
maiden but did so impressively March 29 and could be a factor in
tonight's eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Dedmon Has a Lot of Pop in Her Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Jeff Dedmon was pitching for the Atlanta Braves, he'd bring his
infant daughter, Kristen, to the father-child game at Fulton County
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   It's too bad he retired after the 1988 season, because the Dedmons
would be tough to beat in any father-child game these days.</LD>
<LD>   Last year as a sophomore at Anaheim Esperanza High, Kristen
pitched eight consecutive shutouts to help the Aztecs reach the
Southern Section Division I softball final. She finished 20-5 with 17
shutouts and an 0.07 earned-run average.</LD>
<TE>   But it was her batting last summer for her travel team that has
college coaches ready to offer scholarships. She has continued to
demonstrate her power potential this season with five home runs,
including one against Huntington Beach Marina at Barber Park in
Irvine that rolled some 400 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "She hit it as far and as hard as I've seen in my life," Coach
Dennis Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Dedmon, 5 feet 8, forces pitchers to make good pitches if they
expect to get her out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always taught to relax and attack," she said. "Take your
hacks. You're not going to hit a ball if you don't swing. I just go
up looking for my pitch. If it's not there, I won't swing. I've
always been a patient hitter. I don't chase balls."</TE>
<TE>   For Kristen and her 14-year-old brother, Corey, life revolves
around sports. Their mother, Wilma, and father have been married for
20 years. Jeff was a hotshot pitcher who graduated from Harbor City
Narbonne High in 1977. Wilma was a Carson High graduate going to USC
who hated baseball when they met at a party.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kept going, 'That's Jeff Dedmon, the baseball player,'"
Wilma said. "I said, 'OK.' His best friend came over and spilled beer
on me."</TE>
<TE>   His friend got Wilma's phone number for Jeff and the two became
partners for life. They survived the uncertain years of the minor
leagues, with a stop in Durham, N.C., among other places.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true--he rode that bus, I sat at that ballpark and I can
tell you many Durham Bulls stories," Wilma said.</TE>
<TE>   At 23, Jeff made it to the major leagues as a relief pitcher for
the Braves. He pitched from 1983-87 and for the Cleveland Indians in
1988. Then it was over and time to focus on raising his family. The
Dedmons have lived in Yorba Linda for 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   Wilma runs a law office in Van Nuys. Jeff became an X-ray
technician and coach for his children.</TE>
<TE>   With three pitchers in the family, Wilma thinks there's a
conspiracy to make her a nervous wreck.</TE>
<TE>   "They load the bases and it's like they do it to drive me crazy,"
she said. "Then they strike out three in a row."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff is learning that trying to stay calm while watching his
children compete in sports can be more difficult than pitching in the
major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's always nerve-racking watching them play," he said.
"You're still a parent, no matter if you played or not. It's payback
for the years my dad did it for me."</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, when Kristen competes in club softball, the
Dedmons travel across the country. Every weekend is booked with
softball games through the second week of August. It's a sacrifice
they make so their daughter can fulfill her dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," Kristen said. "I love the feeling of competition,
knowing I'm going up against some of the best players in the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Corey is an outgoing eighth-grader who loves to skateboard and
pitch, but his mother is most impressed with his interest in becoming
a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "My son tells me we're going to open a law firm together and he's
going to fetch me coffee," Wilma said.</TE>
<TE>   If Wilma had her way, Kristen would end up at her alma mater, USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yes, she would be a Trojan all the way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But USC doesn't have a softball program, clearing the way for many
of the nation's top softball teams to take a crack at recruiting her.</TE>
<TE>   She started this season by losing her first three games, hindered
by blisters on her toes. But her pitching and hitting are picking up
for Esperanza (12-7), and that's bad news for opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm back on track," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kristen was too young to remember dressing in a tiny Braves'
uniform or seeing her father pitch, but she understands the
commitment he made to reach the top of his profession, and she wants
to do the same in softball.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll tell me about his experience, and I'll try to relate it to
my game," she said. "I know it's going to be a lot of work, but I'm
willing to put forth the effort to succeed."</TE>

<KH>WNBA DRAFT</KH>
<HD>Sparks Are Playing the Future Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today is draft day in the WNBA and for the Sparks, it may be the
longest day.</LD>
<LD>   The defending WNBA champions will pick 16th--last--in all four
rounds of a draft hardly anyone sees as being deep in talent or
loaded at any particular position.</LD>
<LD>   Spark officials had trade talks during the off-season, hoping to
improve their position in the first round, but couldn't persuade
anyone to deal.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, why would any general manager want to help the team
that has gone 56-8 the last two seasons and last year ended Houston's
four-year title reign?</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks, though, have had success with late selections. Of the
team's starters, only DeLisha Milton was a first-round pick, although
Lisa Leslie certainly could be considered the equivalent of one. She
signed her contract with the league, then was assigned to the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   But General Manager Penny Toler isn't making any predictions.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we tried to draft a player on their position," she
said. "Some worked out, some haven't. I'm not saying we can't get
better, but most of our positions this year are already sewn up, so
we will take the best player available."</TE>
<TE>   Which means that Toler and Coach Michael Cooper probably will try
to pick someone who could be valuable later.</TE>
<TE>   "The luxury that we have is that we have about six core players
and all we have to do is bring our rookies along very slowly," Cooper
said. " ... Hopefully, they'll make a contribution in two or three
years. That's how we're looking at things."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle has the top pick for the second year in a row. The Storm
scored big with Australian Lauren Jackson last season.</TE>
<TE>   Coach and General Manager Lin Dunn knows Jackson could use some
help inside but may feel compelled to take point guard Sue Bird, the
college player of the year and leader of national champion
Connecticut. Quality point guards are as desirable as true centers.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, with the 13th and 28th picks, Dunn may figure a power
forward or center will still be there.</TE>
<TE>   Other players who figure to go quickly are Oklahoma's Stacey
Dales-Schuman, Bird's Connecticut teammates Swin Cash, Asjha Jones
and Tamika Williams, Iowa State's Angie Welle, Tennessee's Michelle
Snow, Baylor's Danielle Crockrom, South Carolina's Shaunzinski
Gortman and Alabama Birmingham's Deanna Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The key to the draft may be where guards Sheila Lambert and Nikki
Teasley are selected.</TE>
<TE>   Both Lambert, of Baylor, and Teasley, of North Carolina, are
immensely talented and figure to go in the first six or seven picks.
But they have possibly off-putting medical histories.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert, an All-American who averaged 19.8 points and 6.5 assists,
broke her lower right leg during an all-star game between college
stars and WNBA pros during the recent Final Four at San Antonio. She
may return to the court by mid- or late June, which won't help a team
looking for a draft pick who can play immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, who averaged 15.2 points and 5.7 assists, sat out the
2000-01 season while battling depression and anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert and Teasley aren't the only questions marks:</TE>
<TE>   * Can the Connecticut quartet of Bird, Cash, Jones and Williams
perform well as individuals or was it their unique chemistry that
made them great?</TE>
<TE>   * Did the tepid Pacific 10 season hurt the chances of Stanford's
Lindsay Yamasaki, Arizona's Elizabeth Pickney, Arizona State's Amanda
Levins and Melody Johnson, and Oregon's Felicia Ragland?</TE>
<TE>   One of them could be available when it's the Sparks' turn.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Ritchie got his first victory with the White Sox and Paul
Konerko and Kenny Lofton homered Thursday night as Chicago defeated
the Cleveland Indians, 7-1, to complete a three-game sweep at
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The Indians, who went to Chicago with a 10-game winning streak,
were outscored, 24-8, in the series.</LD>
<LD>   Ritchie (1-1), acquired in an off-season trade from the Pirates,
gave up six hits and one run in seven innings, for his first American
League victory since he was a reliever with the Twins in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Konerko hit a solo homer in the second and Lofton continued a tear
against his former team, leading off the third with his first homer
for the White Sox, who have won eight of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Lofton also drove in Chicago's first of three runs in the seventh
with a fielder's choice grounder and then raced from first to third
when Bartolo Colon (3-1) made a wild pickoff throw for his second
error of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Baltimore 4--Shane Spencer, trying to prove he
deserves to play every day, hit a three-run homer that sent David
Wells and the Yankees over the Orioles at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Benched recently after a slow start, Spencer returned to the
starting lineup and reached base in all four plate appearances.
Spencer's homer off Scott Erickson (1-2) put the Yankees ahead, 5-4,
in the fourth inning. He also doubled and walked twice.</TE>
<TE>   Wells (3-0) defeated Baltimore for the second time this season. He
pitched eight innings and gave up all four runs in the fourth, three
on Jeff Conine's homer.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Detroit 4--Former Tiger Chris Gomez homered and drove
in four runs as the Devil Rays ended the Tigers' two-game winning
streak with a victory at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming the fifth team since 1900 to start a season 0-11,
Detroit won the first two games of the series against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Kansas City 1--Eric Milton mastered the Royals again
and Torii Hunter hit his fifth home run to give the Twins the victory
at Minneapolis. Milton (3-1) gave up one run and four hits in 72/3
innings, striking out four and walking none. He's 11-2 against the
Royals in his career.</TE>

<HD>Salmon Is Benched, but Angels Flounder</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Struggling right fielder sits out as Ortiz gives
up three home runs in 4-2 loss to Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>With the offense stuck in neutral for yet another day, the Angels
gave their strongest indication that they are no longer willing to
keep Tim Salmon in the lineup on the assumption he eventually will
hit.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia benched Salmon for Thursday's 4-2 loss to
the Oakland Athletics and would not say when the right fielder would
play again. On the heels of the worst season of his career, Salmon is
off to a .143 start this season.</LD>
<LD>   "Our ultimate goal is to get Tim productive and playing well,"
Scioscia said. "We've tried different avenues going back to last
year. We've got to consider all possibilities. If it means he doesn't
play for a while, that's going to be considered."</LD>
<TE>   Said Salmon: "We're all looking for answers. I don't know what the
answer is right now."</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz, pitching for an Angel team with six home runs this
season, gave up three in 61/3 innings Thursday. The Angels rank last
in the major leagues in runs scored, on-base percentage and slugging
percentage, and their 5-10 start ties the worst in franchise history,
a record originally set by the expansion edition of the Angels in
1961.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of befuddles us is, the season opens, and all the good
things we saw in spring training are elusive right now," General
Manager Bill Stoneman said. "It's not just one guy."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia, perhaps casting for ideas, met privately after the game
with center fielder Darin Erstad, who had two of the Angels' seven
hits. Scioscia, whose regular lineup this spring had Salmon batting
third, has used a different lineup in each of the last six games. Of
the Angels' nine starters, six are batting .225 or below, including
Salmon, third baseman Troy Glaus (.178) and second baseman Adam
Kennedy (.182).</TE>
<TE>   "There's more than one reason why our club is stuck in the mud,"
Scioscia said. "It's not all Tim Salmon."</TE>
<TE>   But with the other hitters unable to carry Salmon, Scioscia
decided that keeping him in the lineup was a luxury the team could
not afford. Jeff DaVanon played right field Thursday and doubled in
four at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "We need some production," Scioscia said. "We're hoping it's going
to be Tim, but we have some options."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, none of those options include asking Salmon to
accept a brief assignment to the minor leagues to regroup, as pitcher
Jim Abbott did during a 2-18 season in 1996. Stoneman said that
possibility is "not something we've discussed." Scioscia said such a
move "doesn't make any sense" given that Abbott was learning to pitch
with reduced velocity while Salmon displayed superior skills as
recently as spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "It's confidence," Scioscia said. "His confidence has taken a big
blow.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's dealing with the ghosts of last season. I don't know
if he realizes how strong and how quick his bat is compared to last
season."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels eventually released Abbott and swallowed the $5.6
million owed for the final two years of his contract. The price would
be far more prohibitive for Salmon; the Angels owe him $9.25 million
this year and $28.75 million over the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not get ahead of ourselves," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   After eight seasons of consistent excellence, Salmon, 33, posted
career lows last season in batting average (.227), home runs (17) and
runs batted in (49), a performance he and the team largely attributed
to injuries. He hit .404 in spring training, but Scioscia dropped him
in the batting order after one week this season.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon talked his way into the lineup Wednesday but could not
Thursday. He and the Angels insist he is physically sound. In a
lengthy private meeting before the game, Scioscia told Salmon the
time off was intended to allow him to relax, stop pressing and find
his lost confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a tendency to beat myself up," Salmon said. "He sees that.
Maybe he's doing what he thinks is best for me, even if it's not
necessarily something I would do."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Watkins Offers Bank Backing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman interested in buying the
Angels, has sent Disney a letter in which a New York investment
banking firm promises to stand behind $150 million of the preliminary
offer he has made to purchase the team, a source close to the
negotiations said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins has met with Disney officials and has made a preliminary
offer of $250 million. The letter states that UBS PaineWebber Inc. of
New York will arrange financing for $150 million, a source said,
though it is unclear whether the investment bank is verifying that
Watkins can pay that amount or the bank is trying to find investors
for him. The latter scenario would renew, not resolve, skepticism
that Watkins can afford his goal of sole ownership of a major league
franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins did not return calls seeking comment. Disney officials
declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Disney has not granted exclusive negotiating rights to any party.
Commissioner Bud Selig said last week that Disney had received
permission to share confidential financial data with several
potential buyers, including Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   New York lawyer Miles Prentice, who led one of the investment
groups that lost in the bidding for the Boston Red Sox, said he is
not interested in pursuing the Angels at this time. Prentice
previously bid for the Kansas City Royals and said he discussed
buying the Angels in 1995, before the Autry family sold to Disney.
His sports holdings include the minor league franchise in Midland,
Texas, formerly affiliated with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when the Angels are desperate for every run they can
get, umpires took one away Thursday. After Troy Glaus circled the
bases on an apparent home run down the left-field line, umpires
huddled and ruled the ball foul. Third base umpire Doug Eddings, who
originally ruled it a home run, later admitted he lost sight of the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "The other three umpires all had it foul," Eddings said. "The only
reason you reverse a call is if they're 100% sure."</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel Manager Mike Scioscia: "In my mind, the ball was fair.
I didn't see anything in the play that made it so obviously foul as
to be overturned."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, who said he had never lost a home run that way, eventually
grounded out. But all was not lost for Glaus, who returned to the
lineup with a new pair of contact lenses after missing part of
Tuesday's game and all of Wednesday's because of problems with his
old lenses.</TE>

<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>Time Was Never on Lopes' Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hungering for an opportunity to manage, to be more than a token
minority interview as a series of clubs fulfilled the commissioner's
edict, Davey Lopes wasn't going to reject a legitimate offer when it
finally came, even though he knew Milwaukee was a long way from any
Iowa of his dreams.</LD>
<LD>   Lopes knew the odds. He knew any team owned by Bud Selig wasn't
going to burn the payroll to bring in an impact player or two at a
time when Selig is directing the clubs' attempt to change the
economic system. He knew he would need more years than the three the
Brewers were offering if he was going to remake a team that hadn't
produced a .500 record since 1992 into a contender in his own image
of speed, fire and aggressiveness.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of people discouraged me from taking it because they
thought I was just setting myself up for failure," Lopes was saying
earlier this week, sensing those odds were catching up to him, "but I
was determined to show them I could do it."</LD>
<TE>   A no-win situation reflected by his 144-195 record in two-plus
seasons at the helm and compounded by a 3-12 start to the new season,
the worst start in Brewer history, overtook his determination
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes was fired and replaced on an interim basis by coach Jerry
Royster, a former Dodger infielder who began his major league career
as an apprentice under Lopes when they were teammates in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Their manager then was current Dodger vice president Tom Lasorda,
who reacted to the firing by saying he was stunned and that it didn't
diminish his respect for Lopes' knowledge or his conviction he can be
a successful major league manager.</TE>
<TE>   "When a team has a bad start, the first person they go after is
the manager, that's just the way it is," Lasorda said, "but I really
thought they'd give him more time because he had a lot of work to do
there.</TE>
<TE>   "[What happened] doesn't change the fact he's a good manager and
if he gets the right opportunity with the right team he will be
successful. I don't doubt that at all."</TE>
<TE>   For all of Lopes' determination and insight, the Brewers clearly
didn't represent the opportunity or team.</TE>
<TE>   A three-game sweep by the Pittsburgh Pirates amid declining
attendance in Milwaukee's second-year ballpark was the final blow.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dean Taylor claimed the team had simply stopped
responding to Lopes' leadership and was capable of playing at .500 or
better, as it had for four consecutive months at the end of the 2000
season and the beginning of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the breeze coming off Brewer bats the last two years has
affected Taylor's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, it will be recalled, the all-or-nothing Brewers set a
major league record for strikeouts while finishing next to last in
the National League in stolen bases and on-base percentage.</TE>
<TE>   There were no creative options for Lopes, once a catalytic leadoff
man with the Dodgers, and no future for either batting coach Rod
Carew, replaced by Gary Matthews, or pitching coach Bob Apodaca,
replaced by Dave Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger Eric Young was signed as a free agent in the hope he
could ignite the top of the lineup, but he has documented that you
can't steal first base while batting .140 with a .262 on-base
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of Matthews' hitters are doing what they do best, ranking
third in the league in strikeouts and 14th in on-base percentage and
batting average. There also have been no miracles under the respected
Stewart. Only Colorado has a higher earned-run average than a
comparatively no-name staff that was 12th in the league in pitching
last year when no starter won more than 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Lopes could not overcome the burden. He was Dead Man Walking and
knew it even before the Pittsburgh series when he reminded reporters
that he had told them when hired before the 2000 season that there
were no quick fixes, that it was a five- or seven-year program.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care who you put in this seat," he said. "You can put Joe
Torre in this seat, you can put Dusty Baker. It doesn't matter.
You're going to get the same results. I have no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Royster inherits the seat, but for how long is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   He managed for three years each in the San Diego and Dodger farm
systems, but Taylor conceded he would prefer someone with major
league experience.</TE>
<TE>   The general manager also met with Milwaukee players before
Thursday night's victory over St. Louis and told them they could
throw out that 3-12 record and all the statistics that  went with it.
He said this was Opening Day II and the club was committed to
spending what was necessary to produce a winner, a revelation  that
must have come as news to Lopes.</TE>
<TE>   According to management's own accounting, the Brewers were one of
the few teams to show an operating profit ($9 million after debt
interest) last year but their $50.2 million payroll--which Taylor
said is up 30% since the new park opened--is only 21st among the 30
teams.</TE>
<TE>   If all managers are hired to be fired, baseball's economics have
complicated the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   At Dodger Stadium on Thursday night, San Diego Padre Manager Bruce
Bochy, who employed Lopes as his first base coach from 1995 through
1999 and who called him earlier Thursday to extend support, referred
to the Brewers' personnel uncertainty and said:</TE>
<TE>   "Two weeks is not a lot of time for a manager to get his team
untracked, but the way the money is now, the emphasis on winning from
the start is a lot stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel for Davey. He's an outstanding baseball man who waited a
long time for the opportunity, but he'll get another. I'm sure of
that."</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully for Lopes, it will be closer to Iowa.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Canseco's quest for 500 homers brought him back to the Chicago
White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   Canseco, who needs 38 homers to reach 500 in his career, agreed to
terms Thursday on a minor league contract with the White Sox. He will
report to triple-A Charlotte and be activated in time for the
Knights' game Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Canseco, 37, signed with the White Sox in June and hit .258 with
16 home runs and 49 runs batted in. He has 462 home runs.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers will give John Rocker additional time to decide
whether he will accept his demotion to triple-A Oklahoma. Texas
optioned the struggling reliever to triple-A early Wednesday after he
blew a save opportunity the night before.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released Thursday evening, Ranger General Manager
John Hart and Rocker's agent, Joe Sambito, announced they reached an
agreement that gives Rocker until at least next week to decide if he
wants to report to the minors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins put right-hander Joe Mays on the 15-day
disabled list with inflammation in his right elbow and recalled
right-hander Matt Kinney from triple-A Edmonton.... The St. Louis
Cardinals put pitchers Andy Benes and Garrett Stephenson on the
15-day disabled list. The Cardinals recalled right-handers Josh
Pearce and Mike Crudale from triple-A Memphis.</TE>

<HD>It's a Familiar Ring to Castillo</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Lightweight champion is considered underdog against
Mayweather, but he's used to that role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Luis Castillo is more than just a regular at his hometown team's
games in the Mexican winter baseball league. The World Boxing Council
lightweight champion often takes batting practice with the Mexicali
Eagles, and Castillo has been known to sit on the Eagles' bench--in
full uniform, his name stitched to the back.</LD>
<LD>   Still, it's not as though the fans and opposing teams don't know
who he is and what he does for a living.</LD>
<LD>   "They like me being there," Castillo said in Spanish with a grin,
"just in case a fight breaks out."</LD>
<TE>   Many, though, seem to think that Castillo, 28, will need an entire
baseball team in his corner Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden
Arena in Las Vegas when he defends his belt against Floyd Mayweather
Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather (27-0, 20 knockouts), the WBC super-featherweight
champion, is a heavy favorite, even though he is fighting at 135
pounds for the first time. Castillo (45-4-1, 41 KOs) is a natural
lightweight who will be making his third title defense.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, a former sparring partner of Mexican boxing icon Julio
Cesar Chavez, is taking the slight in stride.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he has been through this before. Castillo was an unknown
when he took the title from Stevie Johnston on June 17, 2000, and
with his 12-round majority decision considered a huge upset, he was
the decided underdog for the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo kept the belt with a 12-round draw three months later.</TE>
<TE>   Against Mayweather, though, Castillo will be facing a fighter many
have anointed as the sport's best, pound for pound.</TE>
<TE>   "They used to say that about Shane Mosley and Oscar De La Hoya
too," Castillo said. "But obviously, everybody loses sometime."</TE>
<TE>   Top Rank Chairman Bob Arum, whose job is to drum up interest in
the fight as its promoter, insists that Castillo is a real threat to
Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's the same Mayweather that fought Jesus Chavez, Castillo
will win the fight," Arum said of Mayweather's ho-hum nine-round TKO</TE>
<TE>   "[Castillo is] very, very strong. He takes a very good punch and
he doesn't lose his determination easy. A lot of these guys get in
with Floyd, and he's so damn fast, that they give up. They give up
because they feel they can't hit him. Castillo is never going to give
up. He'll be in there trying and he throws good body punches also,
which you need to slow up a Mayweather."Castillo has already beaten
Mayweather, sort of.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in training at Castillo's camp in Otomi, where
Mexico's Olympians train high in the mountains of Toluca, someone
broke out a video game.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo sat down to play "Knockout Kings 2000" and set up a fight
against Mayweather. Castillo knocked out the virtual Mayweather in
the second round.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, however, Mayweather, 25, has been downplaying
Castillo's significance, joking that he has trouble remembering and
pronouncing his opponent's trio of names and that he plans on making
short work of Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a very difficult fight, very complicated," Castillo
said. "He's been doing a lot of talking, talking about knocking me
out in three rounds. That means he has to come at me. Let's see if he
can do that.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that he's a great boxer, but he has no power. If he
couldn't knock out guys like Jesus Chavez and Carlos Hernandez, how
does he think he can knock me out at 135 [pounds]?"</TE>
<TE>   Castillo's fighting style of crouching back and unloading to the
body is reminiscent of Julio Cesar Chavez's, which should come as no
surprise since they were sparring partners for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who turned professional in 1990 and won the Mexican
featherweight and super-featherweight titles, said he began thinking
he could contend for a world championship when he was helping Chavez
train for his second fight with De La Hoya in 1998. Castillo
remembers giving his idol all he could handle in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo is the son of a boxer who once fought for a Mexican
national title. His father, also named Jose Luis, enjoyed taking his
sons with him to the gym but now has trouble watching his son's
bouts.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo and his wife, Karelia Romero, are steering their sons,
Jose Luis, 8, and Christian, 3, away from boxing. "It's too hard," he
said, "too difficult a life making a career with your fists."</TE>
<TE>   One of seven children, Castillo is dedicating Saturday's fight to
his late sister, Maria Mercedes, 15, who died in December of
leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   "Floyd keeps saying that he is bringing the lightning," Castillo
said. "Well, I'm bringing the thunder. He should be worried about me.
If he beats me, then he can worry about other fights and [unifying]
titles."</TE>
<TE>   And Castillo can go back to batting practice, wearing his Mexicali
uniform and sitting on the Eagles' bench while waiting for
bench-clearing brawls.</TE>
<TE>   Just in case.</TE>

<LD>One would think the first requirement of memorabilia is that it be
memorable.</LD>
<LD>   But one would be wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "A California company called Sports Artifacts," writes Jeff Miller
in the Miami Herald, "is advertising a bat once used by Dann
Bilardello. For $35, you can secure a piece of this catcher's
legendary career. We wouldn't suggest using the bat, though, since it
obviously doesn't work. In eight seasons, Bilardello hit .204.</LD>
<TE>   "There is also a bronze sculpture of ex-big-league [pitcher] Matt
Young, who was [40] games under .500 for his career.... As silly as
this might sound, how about the asking price of $9,800? So why Matt
Young? The artist is his cousin."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: With 13 NBA titles, the Lakers are second to the
Boston Celtics (16). Who is next in line?</TE>
<TE>   Sticky item: Curt Mueller, a Wisconsin gum maker, paid $10,000 at
a charity auction for a piece of bubble gum chewed by Arizona
Diamondback outfielder Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Sickly item: Mike Tyson has been castigated, and rightly so, for
biting off a chunk of Evander Holyfield's right ear in their 1997
heavyweight title match.</TE>
<TE>   But as low as Tyson sunk that night, he was not alone.</TE>
<TE>   The chunk of Holyfield's ear was recovered and frozen on ice in
order to be surgically reattached. But somewhere between the ring and
the hospital, the ear piece disappeared, apparently stolen by a
memorabilia hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Grand item: Hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once purchased a trip to a
fire station for his kids at a charity auction for $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky wrote out a check and sent it up to the auctioneer.</TE>
<TE>   "And the next item to be auctioned off," said the auctioneer, "is
... a check signed by Wayne Gretzky."</TE>
<TE>   More to it than meets the eye: ESPN "SportsCenter" anchor Stuart
Scott was injured while doing a story on the rigors of trying out for
the New York Jets. During a workout, he was struck in the eye by a
football propelled from a mechanical device.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the eye looked at and they feel that things will get back
to normal," network spokesman Chris LaPlaca told the Houston
Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   Follow up: Chris Cain, golf pro at Penn State, set a Guinness
World Record on Wednesday by playing 505 holes in 12 hours on Penn
State's White Course. The previous mark had been 476 holes in 12
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting those terrible Tigers: With the announcement that Kmart
is ending its sponsorship of Detroit teams, including the struggling
Detroit Tigers, comedian Jay Leno said, "Oh man, how embarrassing is
that? Kmart thinks you're a loser."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1897, John J. McDermott won the first
Boston Marathon in 2 hours 55 minutes 10 seconds. On Sunday, Khalid
Khannouchi set a world record at the London Marathon with a time of
2:05:38.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Chicago Bulls with six.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: "Did you hear about the banner on the side of Ford
Field?" writes Terry Foster in the Detroit News. "It reads: 'Go
Lions.' Underneath, it says: 'And take the Tigers with you.'"</TE>

<HD>Daal Gives the Dodgers a Real Start</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He fills in effectively for injured Brown,
allowing three hits over 61/3 innings in 5-2 victory over Padres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger pitching staff's insurance policy began paying dividends
Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Left-hander Omar Daal, who was acquired in a trade with the
Philadelphia Phillies in November and who demanded a trade in March
when he learned he would begin the season in the bullpen, made his
first start for the team that originally signed him 12 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Daal provided a premium performance as the Dodgers defeated the
San Diego Padres, 5-2, before 24,434 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Daal gave up two unearned runs and three hits and struck out eight
in 61/3 innings as the Dodgers won their second game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek, the No. 8 hitter, hit a home run and a double,
Adrian Beltre extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run
homer and the Dodgers once again received outstanding relief work
from Paul Quantrill, Jesse Orosco, Giovanni Carrara and Eric Gagne,
who earned his sixth save in six opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a great performance from Omar Daal and great production
from Mark Grudzielanek in a spot that was a huge void for us last
season," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   In refusing Daal's trade demand during spring training, Dodger
General Manager Dan Evans had described the 30-year-old as a valued
asset because the staff included two pitchers--Kevin Brown and Andy
Ashby--who had off-season elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Daal had pitched 81/3 innings in four relief appearances before he
took the mound in place of Brown, who reinjured his arm last Saturday
while pitching against the Padres in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Daal (2-0) retired the first nine batters, then gave up an infield
single when he was unable to glove a hard ground ball hit by D'Angelo
Jimenez. He did not allow another hit until Jimenez singled to start
the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who had not pitched more than 21/3 innings in four relief
appearances, threw 94 pitches in a performance that improved his
career record to 45-49 in 125 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Daal said he was not trying to prove anything when he took the
mound as a starter for the first time since spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows what I can do," said Daal, who was 13-7 with a
4.46 earned-run average in 32 starts last season for Philadelphia. "I
didn't think I had to impress anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Daal impressed the Padres, who arrived in Los Angeles after a 7-2
home stand they concluded by winning two of three games against San
Francisco, the first time the Padres had won a series against the
Giants since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "He was throwing everything for strikes and moving everything
around the plate," Padre third baseman Sean Burroughs said. "He
didn't fall behind too much."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, coming off a 5-4 road trip, took a 1-0 lead in the
first inning when Shawn Green lined out to right against Brian
Tollberg (0-3), scoring Cesar Izturis from third base.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres tied it in the fourth after loading the bases on a
single by Jimenez, a walk to Phil Nevin and an error by Izturis at
shortstop on a ground ball hit by Bubba Trammell. Jimenez scored on
Ron Gant's fly ball to center field.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who entered the game seven for 13 with a home run
against Tollberg, put the Dodgers ahead to stay when he led off the
fifth with his second homer of the season. The Dodgers went ahead,
3-1, when Dave Roberts scored from third base after Tollberg was
unable to come up with Paul Lo Duca's ground ball to the right of the
mound.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored their final two runs in the sixth on Beltre's
home run into the Dodger bullpen in left one out after Brian Jordan
led off the inning with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   But the story of the night was Daal, who signed with the Dodgers
as a non-drafted free agent in 1990 and made 99 relief appearances
from 1993-95 before he was traded to the Montreal Expos for minor
league pitcher Rick Clelland.</TE>
<TE>   Daal also played for Toronto, Arizona and the Phillies before
returning to the Dodgers in a trade for minor league right-handers
Jesus Cordero and Eric Junge.</TE>
<TE>   Daal also faced the Padres in his first major league start on Aug.
31, 1996, for Montreal after making 156 relief appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a starter," Daal said, "but reliever or
starter--whatever it takes."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown May Go on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Manager Dan Evans said Thursday that the Dodgers will
consider putting pitcher Kevin Brown on the disabled list if he is
unable to make his next start.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who re-injured his surgically repaired right arm while
pitching last weekend in San Diego, missed his scheduled turn
Thursday night and was replaced by Omar Daal in the Dodgers' 5-2
victory over San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Brown has been playing catch on flat ground from as far as 75 feet
for the last three days as he attempts to recover from torn scar
tissue. He took the day off Thursday and will resume playing catch
today.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers don't play Monday so Brown's next start would not be
until Wednesday at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "The disabled list becomes a situation we have to consider if it
begins to affect the club or puts us in a situation where he is
unable to make his next start," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he does not have a timetable for when he will return to
the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of what they say they want me to do and what my arm
says I can do," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been on the disabled list four times since signing a
$105-million free-agent contract with the Dodgers on Dec 12, 1998. He
said he is more cautious when returning from injuries because of the
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, if I felt what I felt the other day [in San Diego],
I would have walked around the mound, shook it off and gotten back on
the mound again," Brown said. "Having gone through what I went
through with the surgery, obviously you're more cautious because
you're not sure what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, however, said he does not think he will need a
rehabilitation start.</TE>

<HD>Drossin Runs the Risks, Reaps the Rewards</HD>
<DH>Track: World-record holder has pushed the limits and now
dominates U.S. women's distance running.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks after Deena Drossin won an individual silver medal at the
world cross-country championships and shared a team silver medal, she
romped through the Carlsbad 5,000 in 14 minutes 54 seconds, a world
record for a road race.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, she described herself as "strong but not fit," even
though the evidence indicated otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't feel sharp with my speed," she said after her April 7
victory, in which she was timed in 4:45 for the first mile and 4:47
for the uphill, into-the-breeze second mile. "I just did my first
track work in years."</LD>
<TE>   If she can set a world record when she doesn't feel right, imagine
what she might do when she peaks this season--or in her career.</TE>
<TE>   Drossin, 29, has been on a roll the last few months. Starting with
her marathon debut last November in New York, where her time of 2
hours 26 minutes 58 seconds was the fastest debut by an American
woman and the fourth-fastest time recorded by an American woman, she
has dominated the ranks of U.S. women's distance running.</TE>
<TE>   She won her fifth U.S. 8K national cross-country championship in
February by 15 seconds over Colleen De Reuck, and followed that by
winning her third consecutive U.S. 15K title in Jacksonville, Fla.,
in March. Her winning time of 48 minutes 12 seconds broke the
previous U.S. record by 16 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   At the world cross-country meet in Dublin, Drossin and De Reuck
became the first two American women to win individual medals since
1970, when Doris Brown won and Maureen Dickinson finished second. At
Carlsbad, she passed early leader Lornah Kiplagat of Kenya to defeat
a field that included De Reuck and Sonia O'Sullivan, the Sydney
Olympic 5,000 silver medalist.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expecting a fast race out of myself, but not a world
record, that's for sure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Drossin will continue her outdoor schedule today, when she
competes in the two-mile at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in
Walnut. It's more for exercise than pursuit of a record, and also to
support her teammates in the Team USA California distance running
program. Elva Dryer and Jen Rhines are also in the two-mile field.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even know what my best time is," she said, laughing. "I
think the last time I ran it, I was in high school. There's no
pressure as far as time is concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Not that she dislikes pressure. She seems to thrive on it, pushing
herself beyond what she once believed possible.</TE>
<TE>   Her race strategy at Carlsbad, she said, was to take it out hard
because "you never get to see your limits if you don't push and take
risks like that." That nearly sums up her overall approach to running
too.</TE>
<TE>   But it has taken Drossin a while to realize the extent of her
talents, and to regain the passion that had propelled her to two
state high school titles in track and three in cross-country at
Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Although she won seven Southeastern Conference titles at Arkansas,
Drossin was mentally and physically spent by the time her college
career ended in 1996. While in school, she had taken a break from
running to work in a bakery, and she considered giving up running to
operate a cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Before she quit, one of her coaches at Arkansas put her in touch
with Joe Vigil (VEE-hill). Coaching at Adams State College in
out-of-the-way Alamosa, Colo., Vigil had turned out 425 All-America
runners with demanding workouts in the chilly mountain town. Whether
it was the crisp air or Vigil's tough but reassuring manner,
Drossin's enthusiasm was reborn.</TE>
<TE>   "It took about a year for us to get to know each other," said
Vigil, who coaches Drossin and shares the Team USA California
coaching duties with former UCLA coach Bob Larsen. "We developed a
very strong coach-athlete relationship. I believe in her and she
believes in me."</TE>
<TE>   There was no miraculous turnaround, to be sure, and she endured
disappointments in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A freakish accident at the world cross-country championships--she
swallowed a bee early in the 8K race and momentarily blacked
out--held her to 12th place. She won the 10,000 at the U.S. Olympic
trials and finished second in the 5,000, but chose to run only the
10,000--only to be eliminated in a preliminary heat because Achilles'
problems in both feet had idled her for three weeks before the Games
and hurt her conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   She was also disappointed in her 11th-place finish in the 10,000
at last year's World Championships in Edmonton, Canada, emerging from
a doggedly slow race with blood dripping down her shins after being
jostled repeatedly. But she managed to rebound, crediting the
resources at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista and the
altitude training she does at Mammoth Lakes, where she recently
bought a home.</TE>
<TE>   Drossin plans to run the Bolder Boulder 10K May 27, the New York
women's mini-marathon June 8 and the 5K and 10K at the U.S.
championships June 21-23 at Palo Alto. She will run the Chicago
Marathon in October and is considering trying to qualify for the 2004
Olympic team at that distance.</TE>
<TE>   Vigil said they haven't zeroed in on one event. "She's very good
at 5 and very good at 10 and she's going to be better at the
marathon," he said. "Who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Competing at the Olympics, she said, "seems to be the highlight of
any athlete's career. But there seems to be so much more between now
and then."</TE>
<TE>   So many miles to cover and so many more records to break.</TE>

<HD>UCLA's Dantzscher Wins All-Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Jamie Dantzscher didn't know she needed to score a 9.85 on the uneven
bars, UCLA's final event, to take the lead in the tense competition
for the NCAA women's all-around gymnastics title.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore from San Dimas got a 9.90 for her strong, assertive
routine Thursday night, but she knew Alabama's Andree Pickens was
capable of scoring a 10 on the balance beam and forging a tie.</LD>
<LD>   "She could have done it easily," Dantzscher said. "Her beam
routine is gorgeous."</LD>
<TE>   Pickens came close, with a 9.95. But the crowd of 5,656 left
Coleman Coliseum happy on the first night of the NCAA women's
gymnastics championships because even though Dantzscher won the
all-around title, the Crimson Tide edged the Bruins for the highest
point total in the second session of the preliminary team
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (197.300), two-time defending team champion UCLA (197.100)
and Stanford (196.050) advanced to tonight's "Super Six" team final.
They joined afternoon winners Utah (196.775), Georgia (196.650) and
Nebraska (196.575).</TE>
<TE>   "I was very pleased with the poise of our team," UCLA Coach
Valorie Kondos Field said. "We came out a little flat. We started on
the balance beam, and that's tough to start on. We all had a few
minor mistakes, but I'm always interested in seeing how we come back
from mistakes. They did it with poise and confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher recovered from an almost imperceptible bobble on the
beam to score a 9.875. Her total for the four events was 39.675, just
ahead of Pickens (39.625) and Theresa Kulikowski of Utah (39.600).
UCLA junior Onnie Willis, who shared last year's all-around title
with Elise Ray of Michigan, finished eighth (39.425), and Bruin
sophomore Yvonne Tousek was 13th (39.275).</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher downplayed her achievement. "It's not what's most
important to me," she said. "I'm more focused on the team. I think we
did well, but we didn't do our best."</TE>
<TE>   Dantzscher also qualified for Saturday's individual event finals
in all four events. She will be UCLA's lone representative in the
vault, but will be joined by Alyssa Beckerman in the balance beam
final, by Willis on floor exercise and by Doni Thompson, Tousek and
Willis in the uneven bars final.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Coach Suzanne Yoculan predicted tonight's team final will
be tight. "I personally think Utah is as strong as UCLA and Alabama,"
she said.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Lakers Could Use a Switch-Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, which one of you guys was supposed to hit that switch?</LD>
<LD>   The playoffs have arrived, thankfully for the Lakers, who couldn't
get it back together during the season that, let's face it, has
become so b-o-r-i-n-g for them.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is, they've been hitting that switch for weeks ... and
the lights have yet to come back on.</LD>
<TE>   Harking back to April 1, 2001, when they suddenly turned from
quarrelsome and divided to happy and unbeatable, Laker players have
been greeting every little winning streak as the Start of Something
Big, but then something would happen ... the wipeout in Phoenix ...
Shaquille O'Neal hurting his wrist ... the Trail Blazers, in
mid-tantrum with Scottie Pippen ejected and Rasheed Wallace kicking
chairs, still looking hungrier than the Lakers as they came from 10
points behind in the last 5:25 of regulation and eight down in the
last 1:51 of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't sound much like last season yet, does it?</TE>
<TE>   That was when the Kings folded in the stretch, leading the
division April 1 before finishing 6-5, a game behind the Lakers, who
went 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   This March, it was the Lakers who won at Sacramento, cutting the
Kings' lead to half a game, with a 2-1 lead in the season series and
an appointment to see them again in Staples the last night of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lakers went 7-4 while the Kings went 11-0 to clinch the
No. 1 seeding.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and the Spurs, whom the Lakers figure to meet in the second
round, also are a lot hotter than they are, having just won 20 of 23.</TE>
<TE>   As Phil Jackson, a devotee of the late-season run, says: Momentum
counts, making teams, like last season's Lakers, more than they were.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, the Lakers hit San Antonio for the Western Conference
finals on a 15-game winning streak. The Spurs massed their defense on
Shaquille O'Neal, whereupon Kobe Bryant got 45 and 28 points in Games
1 and 2 in the Alamodome and O'Neal adopted Bryant as his little
brother for life.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Spurs went to work trying to contain Bryant, whereupon
Derek Fisher scored 41 in Games 3 and 4, going eight for 12 on
three-pointers. After that, the Spurs were just happy to be allowed
to leave.</TE>
<TE>   That was then, this is now and the Lakers have no momentum ...
making them less than they are.</TE>
<TE>   This is a better team, with O'Neal and Bryant, the game's
mightiest tandem, together in a way we never thought we'd see. Fisher
is an established weapon, Devean George a front-line player, the
athletic Samaki Walker has taken the place of the venerable Horace
Grant, etc.</TE>
<TE>   But that team was hot and this team is not ... yet, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum made them a monster a year ago. With that much less now,
they're that much more vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, think of it as suspense, the first Laker fans
have felt for a while.</TE>
<TE>   This is how it shapes up:</TE>
<TE>   1. SACRAMENTO vs. 8. UTAH</TE>
<TE>   The Kings won the season series, 4-0, so obviously this isn't the
matchup the Jazz was hoping for. The Kings have an offensive machine
and right now, it's a red-hot offensive machine, averaging 113 points
in April.</TE>
<TE>   You never want to underestimate those Utah tough guys, so maybe
they'll win a game.</TE>
<TE>   2. SAN ANTONIO vs. 7. SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   They split the season series, but the SuperSonics--who surprised
everyone, going on a 19-5 run shortly after the All-Star break with
Gary Payton and seemingly little else--went cold (2-6) in April,
while the Spurs kept on blazing.</TE>
<TE>   The new SuperSonic big men, Predrag Drobjnak and Jerome James,
were pleasant surprises, but Tim Duncan and David Robinson are Hall
of Famers.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs will be there if the Lakers make it to the second round.</TE>
<TE>   3. LAKERS vs. 6. PORTLAND</TE>
<TE>   If Sunday's game at Portland did nothing else, it reminded the
Lakers how dangerous the NBA's 2 Live Crew can be, even in the midst
of their histrionics.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Maurice Cheeks went small at the end, with three guards,
Ruben Patterson and Rasheed Wallace, which meant O'Neal had to guard
Wallace, which meant Rasheed could sit on the arc and fire at will.
Cheeks definitely will try it again. My bet is this time, Jackson has
O'Neal guard Patterson, who stays closer to the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Patterson, the "Kobe-stopper," has probably said way too
much for his own good.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will make the second round. The question is whether
they'll struggle or play well enough to develop some momentum of
their own.</TE>
<TE>   4. DALLAS vs. 5. MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks cooled off, but the Timberwolves hit the wall.
Minnesota was 39-18 on March 1, having just polished off the Lakers
in the Target Center, and 11-12 after that, amid reports of problems
between Wally Szczerbiak and teammates again.</TE>
<TE>   This looks like a five-game shootout (the Mavericks averaged 111
as the teams split their four games, the Timberwolves 113) with, oh,
let's say the Timberwolves in an upset.</TE>
<TE>   So, it should be exciting from here on--oh, I forgot about the
East.</TE>
<TE>   1. NEW JERSEY vs. 8. INDIANA</TE>
<TE>   The Nets won the season series, 3-1, but they haven't seen each
other since Dec. 29, when the Nets were rolling and the Pacers were
confused.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Pacers are over being confused as Isiah Thomas tries
to get a handle on this coaching thing, but since acquiring Brad
Miller, they're bigger, stronger and defend better. Jermaine O'Neal
averaged 24 points in April, as the Pacers clawed their way in.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are good too, so this should be a terrific series. Call
me Mr. Upset. I'll say Pacers in five.</TE>
<TE>   2. DETROIT vs. 7. TORONTO</TE>
<TE>   These might be the East's two best teams. The Pistons had the
conference's best record (24-9) after the All-Star break. The Raptors
went on an amazing 12-2 season-ending run after Vince Carter was
injured, so this is a bad time to be catching them.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons won the season series, 3-1, but that's meaningless,
because the last game was Feb. 22, when the Raptors were at full
strength.</TE>
<TE>   Let's call it Pistons in five because they have Jerry Stackhouse,
who's the real deal, while the Raptors have to hope Antonio Davis and
Mo Peterson, normally supporting players, keep putting up numbers.</TE>
<TE>   3. BOSTON vs. 6. PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   In their first playoff appearance since 1995, the Celtics get a
break in the first round against the out-on-their-feet 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson, who'll try to go with a cast on his broken left
hand, sat out the last four weeks and isn't certain to make it back
for Game 1, or any of them. Derrick Coleman sat out the last two
games because of a sore knee.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the three-point-happy Celtics could disappear in a
twinkling if their shots stop falling, although it doesn't figure to
happen here.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, as an old 76er beat writer, let's say Philly in
five.</TE>
<TE>   4. CHARLOTTE vs. 5. ORLANDO</TE>
<TE>   Now for their last hurrah in Carolina. The big question is, will
they draw 10,000 for Game 1?</TE>
<TE>   While their owners were pulling the plug and preparing to flee to
New Orleans, the Hornets, thought to have the East's deepest, biggest
and most talented roster, made a late run.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Hornets are longtime underachievers too, so you
never want to expect too much of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Magic, however, is a goner. Needing only to beat Miami at home
in the season finale for No. 4 and home-court advantage, they had to
play without Tracy McGrady (back) and Mike Miller (ankle) and
succumbed meekly.</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets won the season series, 3-1, and outrebounded Orlando
by 4.5 a game, when the Magic was healthier than it is now. NC, baby,
no contest.</TE>

<LD>After getting beat by a head in a race worth $2 million, Echo Eddie
will try to get the money in a $100,000 stakes today at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   A loser in a photo finish to Caller One in the Golden Shaheen in
Dubai on March 23, the gray gelding will try to win the Valiant Pete
Handicap for a second consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   Echo Eddie, a California-bred son of Restless Con who is owned by
David and Rita Milch and trained by Darrell Vienna, beat Full Moon
Madness--who is also in today's race--in last year's Valiant Pete. He
won by a length in 1:081/5 for the six furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   A former claimer, Echo Eddie has won eight of 16 and will be
reunited with Iggy Puglisi. The rider was aboard for his win in the
2001 Valiant Pete, and, in fact, three victories before that. A
winner of three of four at Santa Anita, Echo Eddie has been 1-2 in
all seven of his races at six furlongs, but it will be interesting to
see how he fares in his first race after taking the long journey to
Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Full Moon Madness, who hasn't run since last year's
Valiant Pete, the field is completed by Men's Exclusive, who was
fourth in the Golden Shaheen; Revelling, who won his first after a
lengthy layoff when beating Irish Muldoon by a nose on April 3; and
Ride And Shine, who was third in that race, beaten by a nose and a
head by Revelling.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Santa Anita has a field of 11
going a mile on the turf and is the fourth leg of a pick six that has
a carryover of $117,360.54</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Martin. The trainer won with five of his first 11
starters at Bay Meadows. His only starter today is Gottalovefaith, a
3-year-old Fastness colt who has won three in a row and four of his
last five. Gottalovefaith is a contender in the seventh at 11/16
miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Frank Brothers. The trainer won with only four of his
first 50 starters this year, below his normal output.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Great White Father and Van
Rouge in the third, all in the fourth and singling Margeds Dandy in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/224. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.40/$1,292. Total money bet: $1,410.</TE>

<LD>Before last season's playoffs, Coach Andy Murray made a big deal
about the Kings' lack of respect. This year, Murray doesn't have to
be as vocal to get respect.</LD>
<LD>   "We respect them and they respect us," Colorado forward and former
King Steven Reinprecht said.</LD>
<LD>   Added Colorado defenseman Darius Kasparaitis: "We know that
playing the Kings is going to be a tough first-round matchup. Being
in the Western Conference, where all of the teams [finished the
season] so very tight, we know all of the teams in the playoffs are
good. It was going to be a battle no matter who we played."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray is still looking for consistency from left wing Jaroslav
Bednar, but the rookie was in the lineup Thursday night, making his
playoff debut.</TE>
<TE>   "We're kind of saying, 'Just do it on a regular basis for us,'
because we could see in training camp the ability he had," Murray
said. "I remember when we got Jason Allison and he was kind of asking
me about some of our players and he said, 'Who is this Bednar?' And I
said, 'We're not completely sure right now who he is, but at times we
think he's like [Alexei] Kovalev from Pittsburgh.'</TE>
<TE>   "He's scored four goals this year [in 22 games] and three of them
have been highlight goals.... He's a top-end skill player. You watch
him do things in practice and [you say to yourself], 'Wow.' He's one
of those guys who can wow you with some of the things he does. You'd
just like to be wowed a little bit more often."</TE>
<TE>   Murray would also like to see more fire from the Czech.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him, 'Are you ready to play in the playoffs?'" Murray
said. "He said, 'I hope so.' And I said, 'Are you ready to play in
the playoffs?' He said, 'I hope so.' I said, 'Are you ready to play
in the playoffs?' He said, 'I'm ready to play.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray, downplaying the Kings' 4-5-2 record in the last three
weeks of the regular season: "We won four of our last seven games. We
went 4-2-1, and if we do that this round, we'll move on to play
somebody else. If you go back 10 games, it doesn't look quite as
good, but I'm just looking at the last seven."</TE>

<HD>Swede and Sour</HD>
<DH>Kings: Forsberg comes back with two assists, and Avalanche
gets the jump with a 4-3 victory on De Vries' goal with 5:34 to play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>For the Colorado Avalanche, everything went according to the script
Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Forsberg assisted on two goals in his first game in 11
months and the Avalanche defeated the Kings, 4-3, in Game 1 of their
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series before a sellout crowd of
18,007 in the Pepsi Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings made a spirited attempt to spoil the coming-out party
for the Swedish superstar, overcoming 2-0 and 3-2 deficits, but their
road winless streak reached seven games after Greg de Vries scored on
a rebound with 5:34 to play.</LD>
<TE>   The goal was the first in 67 playoff games for the defenseman, who
charged into the slot to bang home the rebound of a shot by Eric
Messier.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I stopped [Messier's shot] with my skate," King
goaltender Felix Potvin said. "I was looking for the puck on that
[left] side and I lost it in traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, 0-6-1 on the road since March 18, got two game-tying
goals from Ziggy Palffy and a drought-ending goal from Bryan
Smolinski, whose goal in the second period was only his third since
Jan. 5, the first not scored into an empty net.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, meanwhile, assisted on goals by former King Steven
Reinprecht and Joe Sakic, the second giving the Avalanche a 3-2 lead
early in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised," said King winger Adam Deadmarsh, a former
teammate and one of Forsberg's closest friends. "He's got enough
skill to make up for any time he missed. He's not himself out there,
but he played pretty solid. He didn't look too rusty for missing as
much time as he did. We're going to have to key on him."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, though, thought he could have played a lot better.</TE>
<TE>   "My legs felt heavy the whole game but that's just the way it's
going to be the first couple of games," he said. "It's going to take
time to get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Alex Tanguay, who scored the Avalanche's first goal: "You
can't expect him to go out and score six goals in his first game
back. But he played great hockey and with him in the lineup, that
just gives us more depth.</TE>
<TE>   "Just give him a few games and he'll be unstoppable again."</TE>
<TE>   While all eyes were on Forsberg this week, the Kings quietly
prepared, confident in their ability to pull off a first-round upset
after last year's encouraging playoff showing and their 95-point
regular season, which left them only four points behind the defending
Stanley Cup champion Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, meanwhile, was counting on an emotional boost from
Forsberg to jump-start its title defense. The six-time All-Star
hadn't played since May 9, when he helped the Avalanche eliminate the
Kings from the playoffs with a 5-1 victory in Game 7 of the Western
Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after that game, Forsberg, 28, underwent an emergency
operation to remove his spleen. Four more surgeries on his ankles and
left foot delayed his return, forcing him to sit out the Olympics and
prompting questions this week about whether the Kings would try to
test him early by pounding on him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to be their decision," Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley
said before the game. "Whether he didn't play all year, or we go by
the past playoffs, teams were taking some pretty good runs at him and
it never prevented him from playing his game. I think it brings the
best out of him....</TE>
<TE>   "We're anticipating some great things from Peter."</TE>
<TE>   So was the crowd, which greeted Forsberg with a standing ovation
when he skated onto the ice for his first shift 83 seconds into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, though, wasn't much of a factor in a tightly played
first period that turned sour for the Kings in the last six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   First, an apparent goal by Craig Johnson with 5:18 to play in the
period was waved off because the play had been blown dead.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Tanguay gave the Avalanche a 1-0 lead when he scored with
nine seconds to play in the period after King defenseman Mattias
Norstrom poked the puck away from Sakic, Chris Drury controlling it
in the neutral zone.</TE>
<TE>   Drury steamed up the middle unchecked and fed a pass on the left
wing to Tanguay, who swept the puck from left to right in front of
him, drawing Potvin out of position before carrying the puck into the
slot and slipping a backhanded shot into the unguarded net.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg assisted on the Avalanche's second goal, scored by
Reinprecht from the slot to make the score 2-0 at 4:22 of the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   With Sakic in the penalty box for tripping Cliff Ronning,
Smolinski scored a power-play goal to cut the King deficit to 2-1
with 9:08 remaining in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy tied the score with 5:40 left in the period, taking a pass
from Jason Allison and carrying the puck through the left faceoff
circle and into the slot before sweeping a backhanded shot between
the legs of goaltender Patrick Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Sakic put the Avalanche back in front, scoring a power-play goal
at 1:06 of the third period after Forsberg had poked the puck to him.</TE>
<TE>   But Palffy again pulled the Kings even, again on a backhanded
shot, this time beating Roy on a breakaway with 16:35 to play.</TE>

<KH>Trail Blazers vs. Lakers</KH>
<HD>How They Fared</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers and Portland split their four regular-season games, each
winning their home games:</LD>
<LD>   GAME 1 LAKERS 98, PORTLAND 87</LD>
<LD>   Oct. 30 at Staples Center</LD>
<TE>   On the night of Michael Jordan's return to the NBA, the Lakers
hung a championship banner, took their rings and beat the Trail
Blazers, behind 29 points each by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
O'Neal also had 18 rebounds. The Lakers had 25 fastbreak points;
Portland shot 42.5% from the field. Rasheed Wallace scored 22 points
on 21 attempts and Scottie Pippen, beginning a difficult season
against the Lakers, scored two points. "I don't want to say anything
came easy," Bryant said, "but we might have surprised ourselves with
the way we held them down defensively."</TE>
<TE>   GAME 2 PORTLAND 111, LAKERS 105</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 17 at the Rose Garden</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson made nine of 11 field-goal attempts, scored 22
points and had eight rebounds in 27 minutes, and then called Bryant
"very arrogant" in his postgame analysis. Though the Lakers played
without O'Neal, on the injured list because of his arthritic toe, the
score was tied, 89-89, with 6:41 left. The Trail Blazers rode Bonzi
Wells (27 points), Wallace (25 points) and Patterson to the end,
while Samaki Walker left because of a hyper-extended elbow. Bryant
scored 28 points, but needed 26 shots to get them.</TE>
<TE>   GAME 3 LAKERS 91, PORTLAND 79</TE>
<TE>   March 29 at Staples Center</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 34 points and 18 rebounds and Bryant had 34 points and
seven rebounds, and the Lakers pulled away in the fourth quarter.
Walker took 17 rebounds, continuing his late-season push on the
boards. Wallace, who had a lower back strain, did not play. Still,
the Trail Blazers were within 73-71 before going to pieces, missing
28 of their last 36 shots. The game was memorable for O'Neal's hard
tumble over the first row of seats, landing hard on his left side and
cutting his thumb. He stood up, brushed popcorn off his uniform, and
outscored the Trail Blazers, 12-11, in the final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   GAME 4 PORTLAND 128, LAKERS 120 (2 OT)</TE>
<TE>   April 14 at the Rose Garden</TE>
<TE>   Wells scored 33 points and Patterson had 17 points, 10 rebounds
and three steals in the wildest game of the year. The Trail Blazers
came back from deficits of 10 points in the fourth quarter and eight
points in the first overtime, they hoped setting a tone for a
best-of-five series that would begin in a week. O'Neal scored 36
points but missed four of six field-goal attempts in the two
overtimes. Bryant did not score after regulation. "We gave it away
twice," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said in a terse postgame interview.</TE>

<HD>Horry's Status Report Is Not a Step Forward</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Lakers might not know until Sunday if he is
able to play because of injury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power forward Robert Horry, a large part of the Lakers' postseason
psyche and front line, is questionable for Sunday's game against the
Portland Trail Blazers, the playoff opener for the two-time defending
NBA champions.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors on Thursday discovered a hematoma under Horry's abdominal
muscle, which caused enough swelling and discomfort to force him from
the floor in consecutive games, Monday against Seattle and the
regular-season finale Wednesday against Sacramento. He experienced
sharp pain in both instances.</LD>
<LD>   Horry took two hours of treatment Thursday evening and is to take
regular therapy on the afflicted area through game-time Sunday, and
perhaps a decision on his availability will not be made before then.
Rest and anti-inflammatory medication also were prescribed.</LD>
<TE>   Horry was examined Thursday by four doctors at the
Kerlan-Jobe/HealthSouth Orthopedic Clinic, including team physician
Steve Lombardo. They told Laker officials that an MRI exam revealed a
small pool of blood between muscle fibers and the sheath that holds
them in Horry's left abdominal area.</TE>
<TE>   A team official said it was an unusual malady, perhaps caused by a
hard fall or jostling typical of an NBA game, and that doctors
continued to research its cause, its ramifications on Horry and his
ability to play Sunday. The club said Monday that Horry suffered from
a stomachache, and Wednesday that he had a strained stomach muscle.</TE>
<TE>   If Horry were forced to miss Game 1, his availability for Game 2
Thursday would be more likely because he would have played only three
minutes in 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Players and team personnel arrived sporadically at HealthSouth
Center in El Segundo on a day off for all but the most energetic
among them. The coaches studied the Trail Blazers, a team they know
well from two games in the last three weeks, and the Lakers will
prepare en masse today and Saturday to begin the defense of their
championships.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher went to lift weights and shoot jumpers, not to ponder
the impact of Horry's health and the extent to which it would hamper
the Lakers in the best-of-five series against the dangerous Trail
Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll talk about it if that happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Trail Blazers, Fisher said, Horry brings, "the same
things he always has. There's no secret about what he does for us.
Hopefully he'll be OK and ready to play come Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   In four games against Portland this season, Horry averaged 10.3
points and 5.8 rebounds in 31.5 minutes, five more minutes than his
overall season average. He also made 43.8% of his three-point
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to worry, Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we hear something a bit more concrete, we won't be
concerned," Fisher said. "We all want him to be healthy no matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   Power forwards Mark Madsen and Slava Medvedenko are young and
game, but mostly young, and Coach Phil Jackson rarely plays either in
critical times. That makes Samaki Walker, who signed last summer to
replace free agent Horace Grant, a pivotal player if Horry misses a
game or two, or more, against the Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup problem will be the talented and volatile Rasheed
Wallace, who led the Trail Blazers in scoring and rebounding. He is
quick and strong beneath the basket and is dangerous at the
three-point arc, versatility that made Horry valuable against him.
Jackson believed it too, playing Horry 37 minutes in Sunday's game in
Portland, 18 more than Walker.</TE>
<TE>   "He's played with pain before," Rick Fox said. "I'll think about
it after we get to that point. I don't want to think there's a chance
he doesn't play. No matter how brave and confident we are, he's
definitely a cog in our machine."</TE>
<TE>   Walker averaged 6.7 points and seven rebounds in 24 minutes. He is
not the perimeter threat Horry is, but he can make a mid-range jump
shot. The larger issue will be on defense, where Walker often gets
into early foul trouble because he is aggressive and, according to
Fisher, often lacks the name recognition at the Western Conference's
signature position.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been doing a great job for us on defensive rebounds,
offensive rebounds, just being physical," Fisher said of Walker. "He
doesn't get the benefit [of referees' calls] a lot of times, when
he's playing against the types of guys he competes against as far as
foul calls. But he does a great job of going out there and competing
no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that Samaki is going to play hard and he's going to give
us effort, and that's all you can ask of a guy. And then let
everything else work itself out."</TE>

<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>The Milwaukee Brewers, off to the worst start in franchise history,
fired Manager Davey Lopes on Thursday and replaced him with bench
coach Jerry Royster on an interim basis.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dean Taylor said the Brewers should be a .500 team
even though they haven't had a winning season in a decade and own the
21st-highest payroll in baseball, about $50 million.</LD>
<LD>   "We are committed to winning, regardless of the economic
circumstance out there," Taylor said.</LD>
<TE>   Lopes, in the last season of a three-year contract, had a 144-195
record. The Brewers lost 12 of their first 15 games this season and
crowds were beginning to dwindle at $400-million Miller Park, site of
this summer's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   But Taylor said what really sealed Lopes' fate was the club's
33-72 mark since last June 24.</TE>

<LD>The Estes family name, for nearly five decades a fixture in Southern
California motor racing, is being carried on by Dale Estes, son of
Bob Estes, noted car owner, sponsor and racing benefactor.</LD>
<LD>   The elder Estes died in February at 88.</LD>
<LD>   Dale, who lives in Malibu, is owner and sponsor of a World
SuperKart, driven by Ron White, that is more than matching speeds
with some of the faster vehicles at Willow Springs International
Raceway.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, White's Estes-Warr Racing 250 TZ SuperKart bettered
the record for superbikes with an average speed of 115.104 mph last
month over the nine-turn, 2.5-mile road course.</TE>
<TE>   White, 22, turned 11 consecutive laps in the 1-minute, 18-second
range. His record lap was 1:18.19.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest two-wheel records at Willow Springs are Steve Rapp's
113.882 mph on a 750cc superbike in 2000 and Eddie Lawson's 105 mph
on a 500cc Grand Prix bike in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson, four-time world 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle champion, is
the champion of Willow Springs kart competition but says he has not
made an all-out effort to set the track record.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep hearing about Estes' fast lap, but he's never met us in a
race," Lawson said. "He put on soft tires and made his time, but we
run hard compounds in races so our lap times are higher. One of these
days, I'll slap on some soft tires and go for it.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing keeping us from going faster at this point is the
tires. The small diameter means high rpm, and that really builds up
the heat. We need a little bigger wheel and a tire construction that
will hold up under high-speed cornering loads."</TE>
<TE>   The next race at Willow Springs is June 29-30.</TE>
<TE>   Estes' SuperKart speed is also faster than the Formula 2000 and
Formula Continental cars at Willow Springs. Ira Fierberg, in Tiburon
Racing's 2001 Ford-powered Van Diemen, set the track record for both
classes of 1:19.51.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like every time Eddie [Lawson] shows up for a race,
we're not there, and when we show up, he's not there," said White,
who lives in San Jose. "Or sometimes he's in one class and I'm
running in another. One of these days we'll probably meet."</TE>
<TE>   World SuperKarts are powered by 250cc, two-stroke engines from
Grand Prix motorcycles that produce 80-110 horsepower through a
six-speed transmission. They are complete racing machines, with full
body work, airfoils, four-wheel disc brakes and rack-and-pinion
steering.</TE>
<TE>   There is no suspension, so tires and tire pressure are
significant, given that the driver's seat is an inch or so from the
racing surface.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Estes, a Lincoln-Mercury dealer in Inglewood for many years,
was a legend in Indy car circles. He entered cars in every AAA or
U.S. Auto Club championship and sprint car race between 1950 and
1960.</TE>
<TE>   He had cars in the Indianapolis 500 for 31 years, his highest
finish a third in 1956 with Don Freeland driving. A.J. Watson and Jud
Phillips, two of Indy's renowned crew chiefs, were both employed by
Estes as young men in his Inglewood shop. In 1954, Watson built a car
for Estes that was the forerunner of the famous Watson roadsters that
dominated Indy for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "Jud came close to winning the Indianapolis 500 for my dad in 1955
with Freeland, but at 178 [of 200] laps, with Freeland in the lead,
the gearbox gave up," Dale Estes said. "In 1956, when Freeland
finished third in the Bob Estes Lincoln-Mercury Special, Freeland
swears that the race was mis-scored and Sam Hanks was actually a lap
down."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips had 10 consecutive Indy starts with Estes from 1950 to
1960 and went on to win the 500 with driver Bobby Unser in 1968 in
the Rislone Turbo-Offy Eagle. Among Estes' drivers were Jimmy Bryan,
Eddie Sachs, Don Branson and Pat O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   When USAC was founded in the fall of 1955, after AAA stopped
sanctioning racing, Estes was chosen to represent the car</TE>
<TE>   owners.</TE>
<TE>   As a teenager growing up in Los Angeles, Estes hopped up a 1925
Model T Ford roadster and raced it at 111 mph at Muroc Dry Lake, a
record run in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, his Mercury-powered car with a streamlined body broke the
Class C world land-speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats.</TE>
<TE>   Estes was named to the Sprint Car Hall of Fame last year. His
sprint cars won the Midwestern championship three times, in 1953, '54
and '56, with O'Connor, and again in 1959 with Branson.</TE>
<TE>   Supercross</TE>
<TE>   The split between the American Motorcyclist Assn.'s Pro Racing and
Clear Channel Entertainment, which threatened to disrupt next year's
supercross season, has been resolved, with Clear Channel given
production rights for the next seven years. Earlier this year, the
AMA announced it would promote its own events with a new partner, Jam
Sports, and even went so far as to announce a competitive schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 season will open with three of its first five races at
Anaheim's Edison Field, Jan. 4, Jan. 18 and Feb. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Burton might be the busiest driver in next week's NASCAR
weekend at California Speedway. He will drive the No. 99 Ford Taurus
in the Napa Auto Parts 500 Winston Cup race and the No. 9 Ford in the
Busch Grand National. In between, he will do some TV commentating for
the second IROC race of the season with Scott Goodyear and Bob
Jenkins. Saturday will be his busiest day, starting with Cup practice
at 8:30a.m., happy hour at 11:30 a.m., the Busch race at 1 p.m. and
then a quick trip to the TV booth at 3:45 for the IROC.</TE>
<TE>   Want to have a drink and not worry about driving after the races?
Designated Drivers Inc. will make it possible at the NAPA Auto Parts
500, thanks to Miller Brewing Co. and Gate City Beverage. Spectators
who would rather not drive after a few beers can get rides home from
licensed DDI drivers in the spectators' own vehicles. There will be
booths at all main gates.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Wally Pankratz, 56, won his 17th USAC western midget car main
event last Saturday night at Plaza Park in Visalia. The Orange
veteran led all 30 laps. It was Pankratz's 396th start and his first
victory in nearly three years.... Industry veteran Tom Jenkins is the
new director of motorsports at Edelbrock, which makes racing
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   USAC Ford Focus midgets, a new racing class of cars powered by
identically prepared engines sealed to prevent modifications, will
make their Irwindale Speedway debut on the one-third mile paved oval
as part of Saturday night's NASCAR stock car and Figure 8 program.
Phil Goodwine of Mira Loma won the Ford Focus feature last week on
the dirt at Perris Auto Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League driver Sarah Fisher, out of a ride this season
because of lack of a sponsor, will fill in for Robbie Buhl in
Sunday's Firestone Indy 225 at Nazareth (Pa.) Speedway in the Team
Purex G Force-Infiniti. Buhl is recovering from injuries he suffered
in a qualifying accident March 23 at California Speedway. Richie
Hearn has been signed by A. J. Foyt to replace the injured Eliseo
Salazar in his Dallara-Chevrolet for the Nazareth race.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State will hold a "Celebration of Speed and Splendor"
to showcase classic cars and racing history April 28 at the Pyramid.
The event, spearheaded by Alan Henderson and Michael Lacourse, will
feature Formula One, Indy cars, dragsters, stock cars, sprint cars,
midgets and Trans Am cars among its more than 200 vehicles. Proceeds
will benefit the American Cancer Society, Long Beach Cares and the
CSULB Departments of radiation, therapy and kinesiology. Cars will be
on display from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets: (562) 985-2882.</TE>

<HD>West, Grizzlies Are Set to Talk About Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Memphis Grizzlies intend to contact Jerry West in the coming days
about taking over their basketball operations, continuing the
courting of West by a handful of NBA teams.</LD>
<LD>   West, who already has had similar discussions with the Atlanta
Hawks, among others, has plans to speak to Memphis management,
probably owner Michael Heisley.</LD>
<LD>   The Grizzlies fired general manager Billy Knight on Thursday, a
move that in fact is unrelated to the pending talks with West, who
does not intend to return to the game as a general manager. Club
president Dick Versace fired Knight, apparently after an order by
Heisley.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the flurry of interest, West, a Laker consultant at $1
million annually, has maintained to confidantes that he will consider
only the most attractive circumstances. While there have been rumors
of contract offers of more than $5 million per season, West is not
yet believed to be considering anything seriously.</TE>
<TE>   West, 63, resigned as Laker executive vice president nearly two
years ago, in part because of the strain of running the organization.
Since then, the architect of two eras of Laker championships has
gradually considered his return to the game.</TE>

<TE>   Allen Iverson's status for the playoff opener against Boston won't
be clear until he practices today with the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to do what the doctor tells me," Iverson said. "If
he clears me to play, then obviously I'm going to play. If he says he
doesn't think it's a good idea for me to play, then I won't get out
there and risk further injury."</TE>
<TE>   Boston Coach Jim O'Brien expects Iverson to play Sunday, saying,
"We'll prepare as if he is."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson, who led the league in scoring with 31.4 points per game,
sat out the last 14 games of the regular season after breaking a bone
in his left hand in a game against the Celtics on March 22.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ending any speculation about a comeback by Vince Carter this
season, the Toronto Raptors left him off their playoff roster.</TE>
<TE>   Carter hasn't played since undergoing left knee surgery on March
26.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Rashard Lewis and Vladimir Radmanovich, two key members
of the Seattle SuperSonics, were unable to practice because of
injuries and were listed as questionable for the playoff opener at
San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has a sprained left ankle and Radmanovich has a sprained big
toe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Avery Johnson, the only Dallas player with an NBA
championship ring, was left off the Mavericks' playoff roster, but
Coach Don Nelson added him to his coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Starks was left off the Utah Jazz's playoff roster, signaling
a possible end his career.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz put Quincy Lewis and Rusty LaRue on their 12-man playoff
roster instead of Starks, 36, and injured point guard John Crotty
(knee).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenix Suns, who failed to make the NBA playoffs for the
first time in 14 years, will bring back Frank Johnson as coach next
season.</TE>
<TE>   The team announced that Johnson had signed a three-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 43, took over on Feb. 17 when Scott Skiles left by mutual
agreement with management. The Suns went 11-20 under Johnson, but the
team appeared to play with more enthusiasm.</TE>

<DH>Pro football: Of the top 12 selections in the draft, six of
them could be defensive linemen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Sims is days away from a multimillion-dollar contract. He's
hanging out with rapper P. Diddy, has graced the pages of Sports
Illustrated and Ebony, and is working on his TV persona as host of a
children's show on Nickelodeon. On the football field, he's 310
pounds of fury, a three-year starter for North Carolina who had six
sacks last season, tough to do as a defensive tackle.</LD>
<LD>   One more thing: Sims is better known as the Tar Heels' other
defensive lineman.</LD>
<LD>   "It's always been the Julius Peppers defense," Sims told reporters
at the NFL combine, referring to his fellow North Carolina defensive
lineman likely to be selected No. 2 overall, by Carolina, in this
weekend's draft. "He's a great player. You can't blame them. I always
just knew that if I kept playing hard, I'd get noticed, that my time
would come."</LD>
<TE>   Don't fret for Sims. In a draft rich with talented defensive
linemen, he's near the top of the class. His stock has been soaring
in recent weeks and no one would be surprised if he were among the
top 10 players chosen.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising thing about this cluster of top-notch defensive
linemen is how three pairs of them were college teammates. In
addition to Peppers and Sims, there are Albert Haynesworth and John
Henderson of Tennessee; and Eddie Freeman and Bryan Thomas of Alabama
Birmingham. All could hear their names called Saturday in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "How many 6-foot-5, 300-pound human beings are out there who can
run the 40 in 4.9 seconds?" Arizona Cardinal Coach Dave McGinnis
asked. "There just aren't many. It's still a big-man's game, so when
a crop of them comes along, like this year and last [when seven of
the first 13 picks were defensive linemen], everybody wants one. It's
simple supply and demand."</TE>
<TE>   Of the top 12 picks, half could be defensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   "It all starts up front," New Orleans defensive coordinator Rick
Venturi said. "You've got to be able to stop the run in this league
or you don't have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   It's not unheard of to have two defensive linemen from the same
school drafted in the opening round. A year ago, it happened to
Georgia's Richard Seymour (picked sixth by New England) and Marcus
Stroud (eighth by Jacksonville). In 1998, the tandem was North
Carolina's Greg Ellis (eighth by Dallas) and Vonnie Holliday (19th by
Green Bay).</TE>
<TE>   Haynesworth, a 320-pound defensive tackle, told reporters he
reaped the benefits of playing shoulder to shoulder with 305-pound
Henderson, who won the Outland Trophy as a junior in 2000. Scouts who
came to catch a glimpse of Henderson wound up checking out both
players.</TE>
<TE>   "It also helped me that when I did flourish, [blockers] still had
to worry about John," said Haynesworth, who decided to forgo his
senior year even though he started only one full season. "They really
couldn't double-team both of us at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the game goes, it was fun because they didn't really
know who to block. The quarterback kind of had his head on a swivel.
Also, if I had a question on the field, I could go right to him and
he would know the answer."</TE>
<TE>   A third Tennessee defensive lineman, Will Overstreet, is expected
to go in the second or third round. He's light at 258 pounds--some
teams see him as an outside linebacker--but scouts say he plays
bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee had an embarrassment of riches on the defensive line
last season, and the Tar Heels would have been that way had they done
more to recruit defensive end Kalimba Edwards, who wound up playing
for South Carolina. His father is a North Carolina professor.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, a defensive end at Alabama Birmingham, had 10 sacks last
season and, at 250 pounds, could easily be converted into an NFL
linebacker. His teammate, Freeman, played nose guard in college and
had good speed when he wasn't hampered by foot problems.</TE>
<TE>   Other defensive linemen to watch are Wisconsin's Wendell Bryant,
Notre Dame's Anthony Weaver, Syracuse's Dwight Freeney, Georgia's
Charles Grant, Kentucky's Dennis Johnson and UCLA's Kenyon Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   The hottest prospect is Peppers, although even he has some
detractors. Scouts say he had a tendency to take some plays off.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be the second pick," said an AFC scouting director who
asked not to be identified. "With the second pick, you expect to see
somebody who's great every single play. He's not great every single
play. He's not a dog, but he flashes."</TE>
<TE>   Peppers, who also played basketball at North Carolina, winces at
those assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't take any plays off this year," he said. "I had games
where I had better stats than others, but it wasn't because I wasn't
playing hard. It was just different situations. Different teams put
me in different situations."</TE>

<HD>Montreal Powered by Audette</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Audette and Saku Koivu are back. So are the Montreal
Canadiens.</LD>
<LD>   Audette had three goals and Koivu assisted on two of them as they
emerged from a season spent mostly on the sidelines to help beat the
top-seeded and host Boston Bruins, 5-2, Thursday night in Montreal's
first playoff game in four years.</LD>
<LD>   "The team was playing well without us," Koivu said. "We were
playing playoff hockey over the last 15 games."</LD>
<TE>   Koivu played only the last three games of the regular season after
being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in September and
undergoing treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a huge inspiration for us tonight and this was big for his
confidence," Montreal Coach Michel Therrien said.</TE>
<TE>   Audette played in only 33 games during the regular season, missing
49 after lacerating his left forearm. He returned March 30 and scored
only five goals all season.</TE>
<TE>   "This year has been terrible for me," said Audette, obtained from
Dallas on Nov. 21. "I always dreamed of playing in Montreal and I'm
happy to turn the page and be a Canadien."</TE>
<TE>   He also became part of a rivalry that has faded since the teams'
last postseason meeting in 1994. Still, the 29 playoff matchups
between the teams represent an NHL record.</TE>
<TE>   Boston finished first in the Eastern Conference but won only one
of its last six games. Montreal clinched a playoff berth by going 7-1
in its last eight games. Now the Bruins, who are home again Sunday,
have lost the home-ice advantage in the best-of-seven Eastern
quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Audette tied the score at 1-1 when his shot went in off defenseman
Nick Boynton's stick. The score was tied at 2-2 after two periods
before Audette scored in the third at 2:18 and again at 10:00.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, St. Louis 1--Alexander Karpovtsev scored with 3:10 to
go as the Blackhawks won the opening game of their first round
Western Conference playoff series at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The defenseman had only one goal in the regular season, Oct. 11
against the Coyotes, and sat out the last seven games after
undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery April 3.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Calder, who hadn't scored in 23 games, also scored for the
Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   Pavol Demitra scored in the second period for the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   Jocelyn Thibault, a game-day decision in goal for the Blackhawks
over Steve Passmore, had a strong game, making 34 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, New York Islanders 1--Tie Domi scored the go-ahead goal
in the third period as the Maple Leafs rallied to beat the Islanders
in Game 1 of their first-round series at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Domi, playing on Toronto's top line with Mats Sundin and Mikael
Renberg, scored only his fourth career playoff goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto enforcer played his first playoff game since being
suspended for elbowing New Jersey's Scott Niedermayer in the head in
last year's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Darcy Tucker scored the tying goal, and Sundin added an
empty-netter for the Maple Leafs, who outshot New York, 31-14.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>De Vries Is Perfect for This Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Every year, it's the same thing.</LD>
<LD>   The NHL's big-name players get the media hype before the playoffs
begin, but once the games start, it's usually role players who step
up with the big plays.</LD>
<LD>   This story line held true again in the Kings' 4-3 loss to Colorado
in Game 1 of their first-round series against Colorado on Thursday
night at the Pepsi Center.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Forsberg had two assists, Joe Sakic scored a goal and
Patrick Roy finished with 26 saves, but Colorado's hero was
often-overlooked defenseman Greg de Vries.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having only eight goals and 20 points in 82 regular-season
games, De Vries scored the game's most important goal with 5:34 left
in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to go to the net after [Mike Keane] and [Eric Messier]
did a great job of creating traffic," said De Vries, who scored his
first playoff goal in 67 postseason games, the third longest playoff
drought in NHL history. "I was just there to pick the puck up. I took
a whack at it and found the back of the net.... I don't know what
took me so long to score a playoff goal."</TE>
<TE>   With the majority of the pre-series media attention going to
Forsberg, who returned to the ice after sitting out nearly a year
because of an assortment of injuries, role players for both teams
were pushed to the background.</TE>
<TE>   They just didn't stay there long.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Alex Tanguay and Steven Reinprecht were hardly talked
about before Game 1, but stepped up to give the Avalanche a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can score, especially in the playoffs," Colorado
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis said. "Anybody can be a hero. That's
why you have to concentrate on everybody. If you look at the first
night of the playoffs, the guys who scored the winning OT goals [for
Vancouver and Philadelphia] were players no one expected to do that.
You have to always go hard and try to stop everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Tanguay skates on Colorado's top line but is usually overshadowed
because Sakic also skates on that line. But it was Tanguay who
brought the sellout crowd to its feet when he scored off a pass from
Chris Drury, a key playoff role player for the Avalanche the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Tanguay's seventh career postseason goal was as impressive as they
come. He dragged the puck around King goalie Felix Potvin and sliding
defenseman Aaron Miller before knocking it into an open net.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris just made a great pass and then I saw [Miller] come diving
in," said Tanguay, who had 13 goals and 48 points during the season.
"I was a little surprised to see Potvin come out of the net like
that. It was surprising because we hadn't seen him do that much and
then I think he got hit by Miller."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado scored its second goal in similar fashion. This time it
was unheralded Colorado defenseman Martin Skoula who jumped into the
spotlight first. With Los Angeles' defense reeling early in the
second period, Skoula skated untouched into the King zone before
finding Reinprecht alone near the slot, making it easy for the former
King to give the Avalanche a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   That's when two Los Angeles role players, Cliff Ronning and Bryan
Smolinski, got into the act.</TE>
<TE>   After the Kings killed Colorado's first power-play attempt,
Ronning helped his team into its second man-advantage situation of
the game when he was tripped on a breakaway. Then he set up Smolinski
for the Kings' first goal on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very talented players in [Jason] Allison, [Adam]
Deadmarsh, [Ziggy] Palffy, but a lot of times it's important to have
second, third and fourth lines step up their game and play better in
the playoffs," said Ronning.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 25 minutes, the big-name players such as Palffy and
Sakic took over, combining for the game's next three goals, setting
the stage for De Vries.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great to see Peter back out there and Patty gave us a lift
with his play again," said De Vries. "We know what we have to do. Now
we have to do better in Game 2."</TE>

<HD>Leiter Impresses With Two-Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Leiter made clear who the ace of the New York Met pitching staff
is.</LD>
<LD>   Leiter pitched a two-hitter for the eighth shutout of his career
and Mike Piazza hit an RBI double to lead the Mets to a 1-0 victory
over the Montreal Expos on Thursday night at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Newcomer Pedro Astacio drew the praise of Manager Bobby Valentine
with a complete-game victory Tuesday, but Leiter did even better.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the best performance of the year," Valentine said. "I
think I got Al a little upset by saying Pedro had the best
performance of the year the other day. Al came out against a
hot-hitting team with the hardest game to win, 1-0 on the road, no
doubt about that. He went nine, he was excellent--I couldn't be
happier. That's outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Leiter (2-0) gave up Michael Barrett's double in the fourth and
Jose Vidro's double in the fifth as he pitched his 14th complete game
before an announced crowd of 4,512 that featured a large crowd of Met
fans behind their dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get many complete games, and I was certainly tasting the
complete game--and the shutout," Leiter said. "I don't know how many
I've had in my career, but I cherish every one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Leiter has given up only one earned run in 24 innings for a
league-leading 0.38 ERA in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets scored in the fourth. Roberto Alomar hit a leadoff single
off Javier Vazquez (0-1) and scored from first when Piazza hit a
double over left fielder Lou Collier's head.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 7, St. Louis 5--Richie Sexson homered twice and drove in
a career-high seven runs as the Brewers beat the Cardinals at
Milwaukee in Jerry Royster's first game as interim manager.</TE>
<TE>   Royster replaced Davey Lopes, who was fired Thursday after the
Brewers' 3-12 start, the worst in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Sexson had a two-run triple in the first inning, added a two-run
homer off starter Darryl Kile in the sixth and hit a three-run shot
to center field off Luther Hackman (0-2) in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Houston 4--Aaron Boone got the Reds' comeback
rolling with a three-run homer off Billy Wagner in the eighth inning,
and Jason LaRue singled with the bases loaded in the 10th at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's bullpen blew leads in the eighth and again in the 10th
after Gabe White (1-0) walked Adam Everett with the bases loaded to
put Houston up 4-3 in the top of the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds avoided a three-game sweep by stringing three singles in
the bottom of the 10th against Nelson Cruz (0-2).</TE>
<TE>   Florida 8, Philadelphia 7--Andy Fox singled home the tiebreaking
run with two out in the eighth inning, and the Marlins bounced back
after blowing a four-run lead to defeat the Phillies at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins overcame a 3-0 deficit and led 7-3 before the Phillies
scored four times in the eighth to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Floyd was hit on the foot by a breaking pitch from Ricky
Bottalico (0-1) leading off the eighth, then advanced on a passed
ball by Mike Lieberthal. After a flyout and groundout, Fox grounded
the first pitch through the infield to score Floyd from third.</TE>

<LD>Sports dynasties rise and fall, but Romania's domination of women's
gymnastics has endured.</LD>
<LD>   Romania's women's team has won the last five world championships
and the team gold at the Sydney Olympics. Romanian women also won the
European championship in 1994, 1996 and 1998 before finishing third
in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   All that tumbling and vaulting, however, takes a toll on young
bodies. At one point last month, every member of last year's world
championship team was injured, leading officials of the Romanian
Gymnastics Federation to keep the senior women's team home from this
year's European meet in Patras, Greece.</LD>
<TE>   Their injuries included Sabina Cojocar's shoulder surgery, Silvia
Stroescu's back injury, and a knee injury and subsequent weight gain
experienced by Andreea Raducan, who won the all-around gold medal at
Sydney but lost her prize after testing positive for pseudoephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   Romania will send a promising junior women's team and one
senior-level woman, Oana Petrovschi, to Patras. It will also send a
senior men's team, which is expected to vie with defending champion
Russia for the team title. The women's competition began Thursday and
ends Sunday. The men's competition will begin next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of Romania's senior women is noteworthy, but it's not
a cause for alarm, said Nadia Comaneci, whose triple-gold medal
efforts at the 1976 Montreal Olympics pulled her homeland into the
international spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time this is happening to Romania, but it's
just an unfortunate time," said Comaneci, who has Romanian and U.S.
citizenship but lives in the U.S. with her husband, Bart Conner.</TE>
<TE>   "The seniors are hurt, and this is not an important year. They
have some pains here and there, so they can take treatment and make
sure everything is better. Next year is really important because
qualifying for worlds is important for the [2004] Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   She also said Romanian gymnasts have good funding and facilities,
which isn't the case for all Eastern European athletes. Many Russian
figure skaters, for example, have left home to train in the United
States because economic conditions depleted their country's sports
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, they have more than you can imagine," Comaneci said of the
gymnasts. "Facility-wise and training-wise, they have all they need."</TE>
<TE>   Comaneci is an honorary vice president of the Romanian Gymnastics
Federation and honorary president of the Romanian Olympic Committee.
She said she speaks weekly with Romanian sports officials to keep up
with what's happening. She will go to Greece for the European
gymnastics meet "because I'm curious," and said she is looking
forward to the 2003 world championships in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of the European meet will be Russian Svetlana
Khorkina's attempt to win her third consecutive all-around title and
match the record Comaneci set by winning in 1975, 1977 and 1979. The
defending men's all-around champion is Alexander Beresch of Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   Marathon Man</TE>
<TE>   Not so many years ago, Khalid Khannouchi was a Moroccan immigrant
who washed dishes in a Brooklyn, N.Y., restaurant to support his
passion for running.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, almost two years after becoming a U.S. citizen, Khannouchi
set a world record in winning the London Marathon in 2 hours 5
minutes 38 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Khannouchi's breakthrough came in 1997, when he won the Chicago
Marathon. However, subsequent injuries cast a cloud over his
durability, doubts that were dispelled when he beat Paul Tergat of
Kenya by 10 seconds on the flat course.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of the field meant that I had to work really hard to
win," Khannouchi said Sunday. "I said before that if we had the
opportunity for good weather and good competition, we had a chance to
break the record. And today, everything was perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Who Needs the NFL</TE>
<TE>   if There's Water Polo?</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's national team, which has been in Europe the last
few weeks, will come home for the first season of the FINA Water Polo
World League. The eight-team league will make its debut in late June,
with the U.S. playing its home games at Los Alamitos. The finals will
take place Aug. 1-4 in Athens.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will be in Group B with Sydney gold medalist Hungary,
Sydney runner-up Russia and Croatia. Group A will have Spain, Italy,
Greece and Brazil. Two teams from each group--including host
Greece--will advance to the finals at Athens.</TE>
<TE>   FINA, swimming's international governing body, has committed more
than $1.6 million over four years to support the league and award
prize money. That could help keep some top U.S. players at home
instead of playing professionally in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Alain Baxter, who won Great Britain's first Olympic Alpine skiing
medal when he finished third in the men's slalom but lost it after
testing positive for methamphetamine, has appealed the International
Olympic Committee's decision to take away the medal. Baxter has taken
his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He claims the form of
the drug found in his system was a decongestant and not a
performance-enhancing drug.</TE>
<TE>   Washington revised its bid to host the 2012 Olympics, condensing
events to center activities in Washington and Baltimore. The new
proposal focuses on a new sports complex on the site of RFK
Stadium.... Bill May will defend his overall title at the U.S.
synchronized swimming championships this weekend in Oxford, Ohio.
Yes, his title. May is the sport's lone male competitor. His nickname
is "synchro stud."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Parsons stepped out of the sun to answer the phone.</LD>
<LD>   "What are you doing at Tavarua?" a caller asked.</LD>
<LD>   It was a silly question. Parsons was doing what everyone does at
the remote Fiji island. "I'm just surfing and having a blast," he
answered, politely.</LD>
<TE>   That, basically, is Parson's life. He chases waves for a living.
His sponsor picked up the tab for his two-week Fiji adventure, one
spent carving turns on the shoulders of 10-foot lefts peeling so
beautifully over the Tavarua reef called Cloudbreak.</TE>
<TE>   The swell had dropped on the day Parsons was called to the phone,
but the forecast was for it to pick back up. He didn't want to go
home.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the voices, during a brief conference call, was that of
Surfline.com president Sean Collins, informing Parsons that he was
one of the winners in the Nissan Xterra XXL Big Surf Awards.</TE>
<TE>   The call was placed Tuesday. Parsons arrived home Thursday
afternoon and a few hours later, at the awards ceremony, the San
Clemente surfer was honored for his outstanding performance during
the winter of 2001-2002.</TE>
<TE>   What a lousy winter it was for surfing. Big waves were few and far
between. But Parsons rode more than anyone else, and his successful
drop, followed by a death-defying tube ride, on a towering wall of
water at Jaws, put him over the top.</TE>
<TE>   It was his first trip to the notorious Maui break, and it was an
intimidating initiation. The thunderous waves were shaking the
cliffs. He and his tow-surfing partner, Brad Gerlach, rode out to the
reef atop a shifting and chaotic sea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like you have the whole ocean coming at you," Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered only one serious wipeout. He made it to the bottom but
he had been towed too deep on the shoulder to make the section. He
straightened out and the wave broke. It blasted him out of his board
straps and what seemed like 50 yards through the air. It then took
him under and carried him another 150 yards. He surfaced, gasping for
breath, and a member of the jet-ski rescue squad, which plays so
vital a role at Jaws, was there to pick him up.</TE>
<TE>   This happened Jan. 7, and it was a day Parsons will never forget.
His tube ride scored a perfect 10 on the cards of the judges, during
a tow-in contest eventually won by another duo.</TE>
<TE>   The XXL judges, using calipers and rulers to examine the photos,
eventually determined Parson's wave to measure 64 feet from trough to
crest--good enough for only third place. The same day at Jaws, Cheyne
Horan of Australia was towed onto and successfully negotiated a
65-footer.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest wave, though it was not nearly as steep or hollow,
had already been ridden, during a late-November swell at Maverick's
off Half Moon Bay. It measured 68 feet and earned Carlos Burle of
Brazil a check for $50,000 and the keys to a new sport-utility
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons is hardly bitter. The XXL has been good to him. Last year
he made $66,000 for his tow-in ride on a 66-foot wave during a
historic conquest of Cortes Bank, a submerged seamount 100 miles off
the Southern California coast.</TE>
<TE>   This year, contest presenters Surfline.com and Surfing magazine
handed Parsons $5,000 simply for the effort he put in.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no other surfer who, basically, was at every big swell
this winter," Collins said. "Whether at Hawaii or Maverick's or Todos
Santos, Mike was always there."</TE>
<TE>   Parsons is an uncurable big-wave addict. He and Gerlach were at
Maverick's during the epic Nov. 21 swell, but when the south wind
came up and put an end to that session, they got in their car and
made the long drive home. With only a few hours' sleep, they awoke at
3 a.m., got back in the car, drove across the border, hopped on a
boat and were at Todos Santos Island at first light, just as the same
swell was beginning to hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I did that three times during the winter," Parsons said. "And I
did the same thing at Jaws. I caught the red-eye to LAX and was at
Todos [Island] by noon the next day."</TE>
<TE>   Parsons is among only a few big-wave specialists who believe
that--given the advancements in technology and through Collins'
pioneering forecasting methods--it's only a matter of time before
someone slides down a 100-footer.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, he fully expects that someone will be him.</TE>
<TE>   Big-wave surfing has evolved to the point where the biggest waves,
those moving too fast to be paddled into, require a driver on a
jet-powered personal watercraft, a tow rope, and a specialized board.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to lose sight of the sport's roots, the XXL contest
did have a paddle-in category. The award, a $10,000 check, went to
Paul "Pato" Paterson of Australia, who scratched his way onto a
48-foot wave on Jan. 7 at Oahu's Waimea Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Baja Beat</TE>
<TE>   * East Cape: The Mexican department of fisheries on Wednesday,
responding to mounting pressure from local communities, temporarily
banned the use of gill-nets on a 50-mile stretch of coast between Los
Frailies and El Cardinal. The nets are believed to have played a role
in the deaths of three whales that had washed ashore, fueling the
movement to rid southern Baja waters of the indiscriminate fishing
gear.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Van Wormer Jr., secretary of tourism for Baja California
Sur, is leading a push to have gill-nets banned throughout BCS, which
would protect 60% of the peninsula's coastline.</TE>
<TE>   "Only when we have no netting will we bring back to life the
famous underwater aquarium Jacques Cousteau used to talk about," Van
Wormer said.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Bite</TE>
<TE>   While there are signs of an impending El Nino south of the
border--East Cape waters are already 78 degrees--the only signs off
our coast are red crabs in the offshore currents. The water remains
unseasonably cool and the waiting game is still being played
regarding the exotics, notably white seabass and yellowtail.</TE>
<TE>   Have Worms, Will Travel</TE>
<TE>   The students are always there the day before the Eastern Sierra
trout opener, waving signs at passersby en route to their favorite
destinations. They are the seniors at Big Pine High, and their signs
read, "Worms for Sale."</TE>
<TE>   Selling worms for opening day--this year's opener is April 27--has
been a tradition since 1968; the money is used to help fund the
senior trip. This year's trip, if the students can raise $2,600, will
be to Maui for a week. To help put them over the top, they also will
be selling Indian fry-bread tacos and tamales.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to dig the worms up ourselves, but now we need so many
that we have to order them from a farm back East," said Amy
Steinwand, the school's parent-class advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Just when you thought it was time to stow the skis and snowboards
...</TE>
<TE>   A cold and blustery storm Wednesday plopped a fresh blanket over
much of the Sierra Nevada. Lake Tahoe resorts and Mammoth Mountain
received about a foot of powder, giving spring skiing a wintertime
feel.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>I've decided not to shave, just like the time-honored tradition the
players follow, until the Kings are eliminated from the playoffs or
carry the Stanley Cup above their heads.</LD>
<LD>   This is going to cause problems with the wife, who says she won't
kiss me unless I shave, but I know this, if Andy Garcia had a full
beard and was willing to make out, she wouldn't be around to kiss me
anyway.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   NOW WITH so much riding on every playoff game--my neck is already
beginning to itch--I went to the Kings' morning skate Thursday at the
Pepsi Center and talked puck with Jason Allison, our best player. I
told him I want more goals out of him during the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to do whatever is best for the ..." he said, and I
stopped him in mid-sentence, and told him everyone warned me he was a
dullard and the master of cliches, but it's time now not only to
score more, but show a little personality.</TE>
<TE>   "A dullard?" he said, rubbing his beard. "OK, I'll score more
goals for you in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   I sometimes wonder if I should have been a hockey coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RAN into Andy Murray, who gets paid to get more out of these
guys even though I'm doing the job for him, and told him I set
Allison straight.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get him to open up to you?" Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   No problem, I said, you just have to call him a dullard, and then
he wants to show he's got Jay Leno potential.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MURRAY HAS likened Allison to Shaquille O'Neal, and Thursday he
said he's also "like a quarterback, who gives you the opportunity to
control the game with time of possession."</TE>
<TE>   I asked what baseball player he might be like, and Murray said,
"He plays hard every night," so there's no comparison to any baseball
player. I guess when it became obvious I could be a hockey coach, he
decided it was time to audition for Page 2.</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S NO question, like Shaq, everything rotates around Allison
on the ice. But when Shaq gets the ball, he dunks. When Allison gets
the puck, he passes it to someone else to shoot. He has 55 assists
but only 19 goals. "Isn't there a center in basketball," Allison
asked, "who passes instead of shooting all the time?"</TE>
<TE>   I believe it's usually the center who is matched up against Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALLISON THEN began kidding around, and I'm beginning to believe
now it's L.A. and not me, because since I've been in Denver, I've
found Eric Karros, Kazuhisa Ishii and Allison to be relaxed, engaging
and even funny. Of course, I've always found Karros funny. I just
wonder now if I should stay in Denver all the time and wait for an
occasional visit from one of our L.A. teams.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Allison and I were chummy, he revealed he really does
want to score more. But he said the seven-month layoff before joining
the Kings hurt his aim. "I've been nervous around the net," he said.
"The puck hits my stick, and it's like I grab the stick harder
instead of just relaxing and miss."</TE>
<TE>   I told Allison to "relax," and right away I could tell he felt
better about his chances of scoring more, and I wonder why Murray
never thought of telling him that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY DON'T allow any cheering in the press box here, and do you
know how hard that is on us King fans. Everyone in the stands was
cheering for the Avalanche and going crazy because Peter Forsberg was
playing for the first time since the Kings knocked the spleen out of
him last year.</TE>
<TE>   When the game started, Allison wasn't on the ice, and Murray
likens him to Shaq? Do you think Phil Jackson would start the
playoffs with Jelani McCoy? Then came the second unit, and Allison
was still on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey Andy, put in Allison," I yelled, and apparently they also
don't allow yelling in the press box.</TE>
<TE>   I kept track. In the first six minutes of the game Allison was on
the ice for 20 seconds. Murray compared Allison to a
quarterback--shoot, the kid running out onto the field to retrieve
the kicking tee is out on the field of play longer than Allison, who
finished the first period without a shot on goal.</TE>
<TE>   Avs 1, Kings 0, and I wonder why, Andy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE KINGS went down, 2-0, in the second, Murray called time out to
tell the guys that's not good and I would be writing about them. They
immediately tied the score, and Allison had yet to put a shot on
goal. Maybe somebody should draw him a map and show him where the net
is located. What's Murray doing during the break between periods?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALLISON TOOK a shot early in the third, and it was like watching
Shaq shoot free throws. Instead of aiming for the net, Allison
slammed one off Colorado goalie Patrick Waugh. But at least he took a
shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Avs went ahead, the Kings tied it, the Avs went ahead, and
Allison missed the net--giving him one shot on goal all night. I'm
going to have to have another chat with Allison before Saturday,
because we need him, or I'll be shaving again by Tuesday night and
kissing the wife.</TE>
<TE>   He just can't let that happen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from dwallace@dpsm.usc.edu:</TE>
<TE>   "Look mom, I'm the page two columnist for the Times. Blah, blah,
blah. Mike Garrett is a jerk because he won't take my calls. Blah,
blah, blah. Hockey is boring. Blah, blah, blah. I'm so embarrassed my
daughter is dating a grocery store clerk. Blah, blah, blah. What
happened to the idea of giving the page two column to writers with

<LD>Tracy Bates Leone, coach of the U.S. Under-19 women's national team,
on Thursday named 18 players, including three from Southern
California, to the team that will try to qualify for the first FIFA
Under-19 Women's World Championship in Canada this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Leone, who played on the U.S. team that won the first FIFA Women's
World Championship in China in 1991, selected five college freshmen,
eight high school seniors, three high school juniors and two high
school sophomores to her roster.</LD>
<LD>   The local players chosen were defender Rachel Buehler of San
Diego, forward Megan Kakadelas of Carslbad and midfielder Jill Oakes
of West Hills.</LD>
<TE>   CONCACAF qualifying for the Aug. 17-Sept. 1 world championship in

<TE>   Italy defender Gianluca Pessotto, injured in Wednesday's tie with
Uruguay in Milan, was ruled out of the World Cup after tests Thursday

<TE>   Poland, one of the United States' three first-round opponents at
the World Cup, was lambasted by the Polish media after a 2-1 setback
to Romania on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopeless. The closer it gets, the worst it goes," read the
front-page headline in Gazeta Wyborcza. "They moved like flies in
tar," wrote the tabloid Super Express. "We were our own worst enemy,"
Poland Coach Jerzy Engel said. "But when we will play with our full
squad, everything will be all right."</TE>

<TE>   Albania fired Sulejman Demollari as coach, along with his
assistants, after it was upset, 2-0, by tiny Andorra. Armando Duka,
head of the Albanian soccer federation, stormed into the locker room
after Wednesday's match and told the coaching staff, "You must all be
ashamed of what you have done." He then dismissed them all. It was
only the second victory ever for Andorra.</TE>

<TE>   FIFA officials completed their inspection of South Korea's 10

state-owned television channel after it failed to broadcast
Cameroon's game against Austria the day before. Because of technical
difficulties, CRTV broadcast the sound but not the image, carrying
instead a still picture from an earlier Cameroon game. "Man created
the machine, but the machine has ended up betraying man," CRTV
program director Gervais Mbarga said. "We are indeed very sorry."</TE>

<HD>A Bad Ride for Albert, Fratello</HD>

<LD>It has been a tough season for NBA announcers. There was Chick
Hearn's heart surgery, followed by his broken hip.</LD>
<LD>   And now comes the news that Marv Albert and Mike Fratello were
injured when the limousine they were riding in struck a stalled
delivery truck on an interstate near Trenton, N.J., early Thursday
morning.</LD>
<LD>   Both were cut on the face, and Albert, 60, suffered a concussion
and a sprained ankle. He was held 24 hours for observation at a
Trenton hospital. Fratello, 55, was treated and released.</LD>
<TE>   The limo driver suffered a broken hip and head injuries. Two men
in the delivery truck were not injured.</TE>
<TE>   NBC gave Albert and Fratello the weekend off, although their
status with their other employer, Turner Sports, was undetermined.
Fratello will decide today if he will work Sunday's TNT playoff game
between Toronto and Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   NBC replaced Albert with Tom Hammond, who will call Utah at
Sacramento on Saturday, then the Lakers and Portland at Staples
Center on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Costas will take over Hammond's East Coast
assignments--Indiana at New Jersey on Saturday and Philadelphia at
Boston on Sunday. Costas was given those games because he was already
in New York to tape his HBO show, "On the Record."</TE>
<TE>   Albert and Fratello had worked a Philadelphia-Indiana game at
Indianapolis Wednesday night, then flown on the 76ers' charter to
Philadelphia. The limo was to have taken them to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Groove</TE>
<TE>   Hearn returned to work April 9, and there has been an extra dose
of enthusiasm in his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate everything so much more now," he said. "Before, I
was on automatic pilot. It was like getting up and shaving. You take
things for granted and forget what a gift it is to do what you do."</TE>
<TE>   Those around him have noticed the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen him so happy," Magic Johnson said at Wednesday
night's regular-season finale against Sacramento before leaving for
Atlanta, where he'll work as a TNT studio analyst through Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   At Laker games, Marge Hearn sits a few rows below her husband's
press-row seat with a radio in her lap and an earpiece in her ear.
She listens to the KLAC (570) broadcast so that she'll be prepared to
give Chick a critique on their way home.</TE>
<TE>   "It took him a few games, but I think he's all the way back," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   No Announcement</TE>
<TE>   Hearn is leaning toward retiring after one more season. But he
said there will be no official announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always want to leave the door open," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New Era Awaits</TE>
<TE>   When Hearn finally does retire, it will take two announcers to
replace him--one on television and one on radio. Laker officials say
simulcasts will become a thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   They began in the mid-'60s, when Jack Kent Cooke owned the Lakers,
because sponsors wanted Hearn on radio and television.</TE>
<TE>   One of Hearn's replacements is obvious. Moving into Hearn's seat
should now be an easy transition for Paul Sunderland, who filled in
so ably.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody asked me the other day how it feels to be back to
normal," Sunderland said. "I told them, 'What felt normal was calling
games.'"</TE>
<TE>   Shaq Speaks Out</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal taped an interview with Jim Huber that will be
part of TNT's "NBA Playoff Preview Show" tonight at 10.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the zone defense has affected him, O'Neal said, "It
hasn't affected me at all. I'm like the Tiger Woods of the NBA. You
can do whatever you want. Stretch the field, change the rules, but
I'm so mentally strong that it's not going to stop me."</TE>
<TE>   Charles in Charge</TE>
<TE>   Charles Barkley is responding to criticism he took from Jim Brown
in Sports Illustrated. Brown said Barkley was out of touch with the
black community.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, a guest on Dan Patrick's ESPN Radio show Wednesday, said,
"I'm out of touch because I don't hang out with gangbangers?</TE>
<TE>   "Jim wants to portray himself as some kind of martyr. He has a
history of violence against women and beats the hell out of his car.</TE>
<TE>   "A jury wants him to go to anger management but he's too good to
go to anger management. That doesn't impress me. He obviously needs
anger management."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley says much the same thing in an interview he taped with
ESPN's Jeremy Schaap for this weekend's "Sunday Conversation" on
Sunday's 8 p.m. edition of "SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Woes</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' move from Channel 5 to Channel 13 is not a good thing
for most Dodger fans in the Coachella Valley. Time Warner Cable,
which dominates the area, does not carry Channel 13.</TE>
<TE>   New Dodger Show</TE>
<TE>   KFWB (980), which becomes the Dodgers' flagship radio station next
season, will begin broadcasting "The Jim Tracy Report" next week. It
will be on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:15 a.m., with an
encore airing at 9:15 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   New Racing Show</TE>
<TE>   With the opening of Hollywood Park's season Wednesday, Fox Sports
Net 2 will begin carrying a two-hour show, "Trackside Live," from 3-5
p.m. every race day (7-8 p.m. on Fridays). The show, offering four
live races a day, will be produced by TVG, the horse racing channel
that allows horse players to bet from their homes and is now being
carried by Adelphia and the Dish Network.</TE>
<TE>   Gone will be the popular "Hollywood Park Live" with Kurt Hoover
and Mike Willman, although those two will be part of the new show.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Fox wants to make Joe Buck, Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman its
No. 1 NFL announcing team, but there are some snags and an
announcement is probably about two weeks away.... Bill Walton plans
to attend 30 NBA playoff games in 30 days as part of a "Love It Live"
tour. He'll start out in Sacramento on Saturday and will be at
Staples Center on Sunday. From each site, he'll either work a game
for NBC or file a report for NBA.com or NBA TV.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended viewing: The second part of Lisa Guerrero's interview
with Barry Bonds will be shown on tonight's edition of the "Best Damn
Sports Show Period" on Fox Sports Net.... Fox Sports Net sure gave
short shift to the halftime ceremony honoring the Minneapolis Lakers
at Staples Center last week.... With NASCAR coming to Southern
California next week for the Winston Cup Napa Auto Parts 500 at
California Speedway in Fontana on April 28, a number of drivers will
make appearances on "Wheel of Fortune" next week. Contestants will be
NASCAR fans.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Daze</TE>
<TE>   Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian had baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig taking calls from listeners on their "McDonnell Douglas" show
on KSPN (1110) Monday, making for an interesting hour of talk radio.
Then they negated the positive with a silly, contrived and phony feud
on Wednesday. That's typical. They put a Muhammad Ali impersonator on
the air on April 1 without explaining that it was an April Fool's
joke. The impersonator, Kevin Lamp, the brother of former major
league pitcher Dennis Lamp, was so good that a couple of callers
thought they were talking to the real Ali. Their listeners aren't too
bright either.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   KSPN boxing expert Johnny Ortiz went on "McDonnell Douglas"
Thursday and reported that Oscar De La Hoya will announce his
retirement next week. If it comes true, Ortiz got a big scoop. But
the report was denied by promoter Bob Arum and the De La Hoya camp.</TE>

<HD>Versatile Ware Can Throw More Than Book at Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Ware is buried in English requirements, reading a 400-page book
and writing three five-page essays every week. Yet for all his study
of the language, the UCLA freshman apparently doesn't understand the
meaning of the word no.</LD>
<LD>   His responsibilities increase with every football practice this
spring, and the looming summer offers not a respite but a new
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Ware, a Sporting News freshman All-American cornerback last
season, also ran a handful of plays at quarterback and made one
reception at receiver. What was then a novelty could become
necessity.</LD>
<TE>   Cory Paus is the Bruins' only experienced quarterback, bringing
urgency to Ware's development at the position. He meets with Coach
Bob Toledo and quarterback coach John Pearce daily, adding to his
workload.</TE>
<TE>   "A play a day, that's it, I learn a play a day," Ware said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season his duties consisted of simple keepers around end and
a rudimentary option play. Toledo is adding a variety of calls,
including counters and even an occasional pass.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such a threat," Toledo said. "He doesn't throw the ball well
enough to be a [full-time] quarterback, but he can add a dimension
with his athleticism and ability to run the ball. It's something he's
eager about and willing to learn."</TE>
<TE>   All while rushing from quarterback meetings to one-on-one sessions
with receiver coach Ron Caragher to learn pass routes.</TE>
<TE>   And while learning a new defensive position, free safety.</TE>
<TE>   And while realizing that his professional baseball career with the
Seattle Mariners will begin a few days after the spring quarter ends,
a six-week rookie league assignment in Peoria, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   The weight of responsibility on Ware is greater than a full shelf
of those 400-page hardcover English tomes, but he makes light of it,
breaking into a lopsided grin when accused of being unable to say
enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited to contribute on both sides of the ball," he
said. "I'm excited about baseball. I'm all for it. Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   Only he can answer that, but spreading himself so thin eventually
could be problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Ware's primary role is anchoring the secondary at safety--his high
school position--because of the departure of seniors Marques Anderson
and Jason Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my natural spot, but there is a lot to learn," Ware said.
"In high school I just freelanced a lot. I have to read the tackle
and the back and make adjustments. I have to provide run support.
It's more complicated than corner."</TE>
<TE>   His progress slowed when he twisted his left knee in practice
Wednesday and sat out most of Thursday's scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he's sound, though, it will be back to safety, back
under center, back to receiver. Last season, Ware led the team with
five interceptions, averaged 5.5 yards in four carries and gained 49
yards on his only reception.</TE>
<TE>   Spring football ends with an April 27 scrimmage. Ware will focus
on school for about a month and then report to Peoria, where he will
take on a sport he hasn't played in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Enamored of his athleticism and strong character, the Mariners
drafted him in the 21st round last June on the basis of a tryout and
gave him a signing bonus of about $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he is focused on weight training, beefing up from 195
pounds to 205.</TE>
<TE>   "When the time comes I'll be all baseball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His only reminder is a baseball that sits on his desk. During
breaks from studying he picks it up and tosses it in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Enough frivolity. Ware buries his head back into the English
books. There is no time to waste, not with so much to learn.
Somewhere in those books is the word overload, but he's not there
yet.</TE>

<HD>Judge Limits Hikes in Formerly Subsidized Rents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued an order preventing the
owner of a federally subsidized apartment building in Echo Park from
raising rents to market value after exiting the government program.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge George H. King has raised hopes
among advocates of affordable housing that other landlords can be
stopped from fleeing subsidized housing programs--thereby removing
thousands of low-cost units from the market.</LD>
<LD>   But building owners say the decision unfairly defies federal law
and could discourage other landlords from entering into pacts with
the government to supply low-cost apartments.</LD>
<TE>   King's ruling rejects the contention among many owners of
subsidized apartments that federal law allows landlords to exit the
program and raise rents.</TE>
<TE>   Owners contend that the federal statutes supersede provisions of
Los Angeles' Rent Stabilization Ordinance, said Deputy City Atty.
Kenneth Fong.</TE>
<TE>   The city ordinance requires that HUD rental units immediately
become subject to rent-control laws when the owners opt out of the
federal program. Rents, therefore, must remain at levels that often
fall far below the current market value.</TE>
<TE>   King's ruling earlier this month stems from a September 2000
lawsuit filed by developers Topa Equities Ltd. against the city of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which owns the 66-unit Morton Gardens complex in Echo
Park, claimed that, under the government's 1990 Low Income Housing
Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act, landlords are allowed to
raise rents when they leave the federal subsidy program.</TE>
<TE>   King ruled, however, that federal courts have repeatedly
recognized Congress' intention that federal housing programs should
benefit residents of low-income housing, not commercial developers,
and that there are no definitive policies that preempt local law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous decision that will send a message to owners
thinking of prepaying their [Housing and Urban Development] mortgages
and getting out of federal rent restriction," said Larry Gross,
executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a
nonprofit tenants' rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenants will no longer fear being pushed out of their homes."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Grow, staff attorney for the National Housing Law Project,
concurred. "This ruling is tremendous because it says that the
federal government has no business telling local governments how to
regulate their local housing stock," he said. "The owners will now
have less incentive to convert to market rate."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney representing Topa Equities, which is considering
appealing the judge's decision, called the ruling unfair and said it
will discourage developers from participating in federally subsidized
housing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Azad said Topa joined the program with the understanding
that it could opt out at 20 years, raise rents, then adhere to the
city's rent-control ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Without the rent increases Topa Equities anticipated, the company
will not be able to generate enough income to maintain the building
properly, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The owners were sold a bill of goods," Azad said. "They had a
deal with the federal government. It was changed several times, and
now the city says they can't raise rents.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the owners known this at the outset, they probably wouldn't
have gotten involved," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal housing programs helped build most of the state's
low-income units from the 1960s through the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   In one program, the subsidy required tenants to pay 30% of their
monthly income toward the rent, with HUD paying landlords the
difference. In exchange, building owners agreed to rent the units to
low-income tenants for 20 years, after which they could exit the
federal program and raise rents to market levels.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many owners of subsidized apartments want to get out of the
federal program to take advantage of rapidly rising market rents.</TE>
<TE>   In California, about 350,000 tenants live in subsidized
apartments. The majority of those renters are single parents, elderly
or disabled tenants who subsist on incomes of $9,000 a year or less.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, California has lost one out of seven of its subsidized
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, 16,000 units are subsidized and could be affected
by the recent court ruling, said Sally Richman, manager of policy and
planning at the Los Angeles Housing Department.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of perhaps thousands of low-income units would put
further pressure on Los Angeles' already inadequate supply of
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   With King's ruling, low-income housing advocates are hoping
landlords will think twice about opting out of the program early.</TE>
<TE>   "The real impact of this decision is that it will be harder for
those who want to get rid of affordable housing," said Jan
Breidenbach, director of the Southern California Assn. of Non-Profit
Housing.</TE>
<TE>   "It really means that affordable housing will stay affordable."</TE>

<HD>Thundering Birds Return to Mugu</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The elite squadron, grounded by poor weather last
year, headlines at the air show this weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd Canterbury remembers standing among a crowd of thousands at Luke
Air Force Base in Phoenix when he was 15, his neck stretched back,
eyes on the sky. There, he caught a glimpse of his future.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember seeing the Thunderbirds and deciding that I wanted to
join the Air Force," he recalled.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10 years after joining the Air Force, Capt. Canterbury, who
has flown combat missions over northern Iraq, is one of six pilots on
the Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron. The team, better known as
the Thunderbirds, is again the featured act at the Point Mugu Air
Show, which begins at noon today and runs through Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   This weekend will be Canterbury's third show with the famed stunt
pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been great to see all the American flags waving at the
shows," he said. "With our red, white and blue planes ... we want to
instill a sense of pride and patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   He describes his most exciting maneuver as a fly-by in which he
and a teammate close in on each other from opposite directions, going
500 mph only 150 feet apart. During a performance, the F-16s will
slip as low as 200 feet above the ground so the audience can get a
clear view from their seats.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the team arrived at Point Mugu, barreling through the
sky and leaving plumes of white smoke in its wake. After landing,
crew members conducted synchronized safety checks and attached
ladders to the planes. Every move is choreographed, including the
pilots' descent from their F-16s.</TE>
<TE>   The Thunderbirds were scheduled to perform at last year's air show
but were grounded because of weather conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But with clear skies and temperatures in the low 60s predicted for
this weekend, organizers expect more than 300,000 people to turn out
for the three-day show. The Thunderbirds are scheduled to perform at
3 p.m. each day. Besides the Thunderbirds, military flight
demonstrations will include the F-14 Tomcat, the FA-18 Hornet, E-2
Hawkeye and the C-130E Hercules. Stunt demonstrations by civilian
performers will be staged throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   There will also be displays of current and vintage aircraft as
well as events for children, including a climbing wall and a flight
simulator.</TE>
<TE>   Canterbury and event organizers expect that there will be an
increased sense of patriotism at this year's show and that crowds
will be feeling extra supportive of the military after Sept. 11. In
fact, the show's theme is "The Sights and Sounds of Freedom." But
national pride won't be the only thing different. Spectators should
anticipate increased security.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking people not to bring in backpacks, coolers, pets or
skates," said Vance Vasquez, a public-affairs specialist at Naval
Base Ventura County. "We will have three entrance points, where
people will be screened."</TE>
<TE>   Screening may include searches of purses and other bags, and
visitors may be scanned by a metal detector. Military dogs will sniff
bags coming into the show.</TE>
<TE>   "We recommend carpooling and arriving early," Vasquez said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who attend should use Las Posas Road to reach the base and
enter at Gate 1 or Gate 3. Motorists will be directed to parking,
which is free. Handicapped spaces and limited RV spots are available.</TE>
<TE>   Canterbury has a message for any ambitious youngsters in the
audience this weekend: "Set goals and work hard to achieve those
goals," he said. "Just 15 years ago, I was standing out there too."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor negotiations resumed Thursday between striking school bus
drivers and the Los Angeles Unified School District's main
transportation contractor, Laidlaw Education Services.</LD>
<LD>   The talks focused on a health-care benefit package proposed by
Teamsters Union Local 572.</LD>
<LD>   "If we can get an agreement on health care, that would be dealing
with the most expensive part of the contract," said Don Owens, a
Teamster spokesman. "That would free up more money to work on wages
and the pension plan."</LD>
<TE>   The strike began April 2 and has been affecting about 20,000
students. Substitute drivers have been keeping service going on the
strike-bound routes, but many youngsters have been getting to school
an hour late.</TE>

<LD>Prosecutors on Thursday dropped an arson charge against a Los Angeles
County Fire Department public information officer's wife, who was
accused with her husband of setting fire to a Pasadena house they had
tried to buy.</LD>
<LD>   The felony count against Heidi Sprewell, 36, was dismissed in the
interest of justice, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Roland Sprewell, 37, who was also charged with arson, is due in
Pasadena Superior Court May 20 to set a preliminary hearing date.</LD>
<TE>   Vicki Podberesky, an attorney for the Altadena couple, said she
has evidence to clear Roland Sprewell, including several witnesses
who saw individuals other than the Sprewells at the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   The July blaze occurred after a bank allegedly refused to return
the Sprewells' deposit on the house in the 1500 block of North
Raymond Avenue.</TE>

<HD>Man to Stand Trial on Charges He Killed Wife</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Panorama City man will stand trial on charges that he strangled his
wife, carved up her body and dumped the remains in the ocean off the
Ventura County coast because she had threatened to leave him.</LD>
<LD>   After a three-hour preliminary hearing Thursday, Ventura County
Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath ruled that there was enough
evidence for 37-year-old tile setter Alfonso Castillo to stand trial
on the charges. Trial is scheduled to be set May 2.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo was arrested Dec. 6 near Mugu Rock after a Ventura County
sheriff's deputy spotted an illegally parked pickup truck and then
saw a blood-spattered Castillo climbing up a rocky area from the
surf.</LD>
<TE>   A week later, prosecutors charged Castillo with killing his wife,
34-year-old Maria Guadalupe Pinaloza Ambario.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who is in custody in lieu of $1-million bail, sat
expressionless Thursday as sheriff's deputies and investigators
detailed the woman's death and grisly attempts to dispose of the
evidence. A Spanish interpreter sat at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. James Panza said Castillo first told authorities that the
blood on his clothes came from a cut on his arm and that he was
climbing the rocks to dispose of a cat he had run over earlier in the
evening.</TE>
<TE>   But deputies shining search lights on the water saw human limbs
bobbing in the ocean. Authorities later recovered several of
Ambario's body parts, including her head. .</TE>
<TE>   In late December, Castillo wrote to authorities, asking to speak
with them about the case, said sheriff's Sgt. Lawrence Kelley.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kelley's court testimony, Castillo told authorities
that he and Ambario had a fight over the fact that she was going to
leave him. Castillo pushed her and she fell, hitting her head on
weights that were on the floor, Kelley said. Angry, Castillo left for
work, not knowing that she had died until he returned home and found
her lying in the same position.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said calling for help "did not make much sense to him,"
Kelley testified. He admitted to cutting up his wife's body so he
could dispose of her more easily, Kelley said.</TE>

sheriff's deputy spotted an illegally parked pickup truck and then
saw a blood-spattered Castillo climbing up a rocky area from the

<TE>   A week later, prosecutors charged Castillo with killing his wife
of two years, 34-year-old Maria Guadalupe Pinaloza Ambario.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who is in custody in lieu of $1-million bail, sat
expressionless Thursday as sheriff's deputies and investigators
detailed the alleged killing and grisly attempts to dispose of the
evidence. A Spanish interpreter sat at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. James Panza said Castillo first told authorities that the
blood on his clothes came from a cut on his arm and that he was
climbing the rocks just after midnight Dec. 6 to dispose of a cat he
had run over earlier in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he felt bad about it, and was going to throw it in the
water," Panza testified.</TE>
<TE>   But deputies shining search lights on the water saw human limbs
bobbing in the ocean. Authorities later recovered several of
Ambario's body parts, including her head. A search of Castillo's
Panorama City apartment, which authorities said he shared with
Ambario for seven years, turned up several knives--including an
8-inch chef's knife purchased by Castillo on Dec. 5--and a bow saw
with blood stains, Panza said.</TE>
<TE>   Women's clothing and Ambario's cut-up driver's license were
recovered in nearby trash bins. Investigators found a mangled human
heart in the kitchen garbage disposal, Panza testified.</TE>
<TE>   In late December, Castillo wrote to authorities asking to speak
with them about the case, said Sheriff's Sgt. Lawrence Kelley.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities met with him in jail, Castillo waived his rights
and told them a different version of what happened, Kelley said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kelley's court testimony, Castillo told authorities
that he and Ambario had a fight over the fact that she was going to
leave him. Castillo pushed her and she fell, hitting her head on
weights that were on the floor. Angry, he left for work, not knowing
that she had died until he returned home and found her lying in the
same position.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said calling for help "did not make much sense to him,"
Kelley testified. He admitted to cutting up his wife's body so he
could dispose of her more easily, Kelley said, adding that Castillo
then threw away her belongings to "make it look like she
disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Assistant Chief Medical Examiner Janice Frank
testified that Ambario died from a lack of oxygen to her brain, most
likely because someone strangled her.</TE>
<TE>   It did not appear that she had fallen, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Public Defender Doug Daily attempted to establish
that authorities did not try hard enough to ensure that Castillo
understood his right to have his attorney present when he confessed
to killing his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley told Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Harmon that Castillo's
rights were read to him in both English and Spanish and that the
conversation was recorded and videotaped.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Meets With Navy on El Toro Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Military officials hear the city's proposal but
give little sign of what they will do. A decision will be announced
Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials presented their plan for developing the El Toro
Marine base as a park and university to Navy representatives
Thursday, but walked away with only a renewed pledge from Washington
that the base's fate would be announced next week.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the session left park backers upbeat. "It was a very
productive meeting and the Navy will let us know on Tuesday," said
Irvine Councilman Mike Ward, who was briefed on the meeting by City
Manager Allison Hart.</LD>
<LD>   In the March 5 election, Orange County voters killed county
government's hope to build an airport at El Toro by rezoning the base
for a park, a nature preserve and limited development.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine wants the Navy to give it about 3,600 acres of the base,
with the military sharing in proceeds from the sale of 1,500 new
homes to be built on 440 acres along the base's southern edge.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials gave the impression that they will dispose of the
4,700-acre base and work with Irvine on how to do that, said Paul
Eckles, executive director of the nine-city, anti-airport El Toro
Reuse Planning Authority. Whether they give land to Irvine in
exchange for development money or arrange some other type of sale
hasn't been determined, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all up for negotiation, but they're willing to work out the
details with the city of Irvine," Eckles said. "Certainly money is an
issue and there are a lot of procedural issues to be worked out. But
our people went out of the meeting very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials said they won't comment on the base's future before
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's proposal calls for the base to be used for a southern
campus for Cal State Fullerton, a campus research park and faculty
housing shared with UC Irvine, and an expansion of the Orange County
Fair and Exposition Center.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 acres of the base already has been set aside by the
federal government as a wildlife sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Others attending Thursday's meeting were Irvine Councilman Chris
Mears, Irvine planner Dan Jung, Lake Forest Mayor Richard T. Dixon
and Councilman Peter Herzog, and Laguna Hills Councilman L. Allan
Songstad Jr., representing the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a contingent of elected leaders from Southern
California asked Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Jane
Garvey and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta to urge the
Navy to postpone its El Toro decision and preserve the option for an
airport there.</TE>
<TE>   An FAA spokesman said Thursday that the agency would not pressure
the Navy to delay.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to do anything to prevent the decisions made by
the people of Orange County from going forward," said Los
Angeles-based FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   "Our input has had to do with the impact of having an airport
there, not whether the property would be used for an airport. That's
not our decision."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Board of Supervisors agreed to allow Irvine to
annex the property and take control of what is built at the base. The
Navy announced the day after the March 5 vote that it intended to
sell all or parts of the base and use the money for the military
budget.</TE>

<HD>2 Teen Inmates Sought After Escaping in Van</HD>
<DH>Crime: They were on the way to a facility for low-level
offenders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two juvenile offenders are being sought by police for commandeering a
Probation Department vehicle April 6 and escaping, officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky said the 16-year-olds
assaulted the driver of their van while being taken to Camp William
Mendenhall in Lake Hughes near Lancaster, where low-level offenders
are housed. Shumsky said the youths were in handcuffs and leg
restraints when they attacked and choked the driver, who was forced
out of the vehicle. The keys were left in the ignition and the youths
drove away, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The marked vehicle was found in Pico Rivera several days later, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   "This was certainly out of the ordinary," Shumsky said. "They made
one very impulsive and stupid mistake. It will be dealt with in the
most severe manner."</TE>
<TE>   The youths' names are being withheld because of their age.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the escape, one of the youths made several calls to
officers at Camp William Mendenhall, promising to surrender and
asking what consequences he faces. The calls came from pay phones and
officials were unable to trace them, Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "They both now know that they are facing very serious charges,"
Shumsky said. "We can't tell them that nothing will happen to them."</TE>
<TE>   The assault on the driver was their first violent crime, Shumsky
said.</TE>
<TE>   One boy was incarcerated for stealing a car; the other for driving
without a license, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Juvenile escapes in Los Angeles County have declined over the last
three years, Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 47 escaped, among a total of about 4,500 juvenile
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Most are considered "walkaways," inmates who slip away during
activities outside their detention facility, Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the escape, juvenile inmates are transported with their
hands cuffed to chains around their waists, rather than behind their
backs, Shumsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Shumsky said the bus driver was treated at a local hospital and
released after the assault, and did not suffer any disciplinary
action resulting from the escape.</TE>

<HD>FBI Arrests 400 in Sting</HD>
<DH>Crime: A multi-agency task force set up a fake clinic as
part of a two-year effort to crack down on health care fraud across
the state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 400 arrests have been made in the last two years and hundreds
more are expected in a crackdown on health care fraud in California
by the state's four major FBI offices, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, coordinated with other federal and state law
enforcement agencies, included a large-scale sting operation in Los
Angeles. Targeting illegal kickbacks and false billing schemes, FBI
agents set up their own "wellness clinic" in an office building in
Encino and called it Western Comprehensive Care.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles effort, in which state and federal agents posed as
doctors and former FBI agents posed as patients, was known as
Durascam and began in 1998. Arrests were delayed until two years of
undercover dealings with owners of medical supply companies and
clinical laboratories were completed.</LD>
<TE>   "Agents actually received about $180,000 in kickbacks," said FBI
Agent Daniel M. Martino, who headed the Los Angeles operation. "To
date we have made 23 arrests [in Durascam], and we have another 116
suspects under active investigation."</TE>
<TE>   The suspects in the investigation offered kickbacks for the clinic
to exaggerate or falsify documents justifying the need for such
durable medical equipment as wheelchairs, oxygen concentrators and
body braces, Martino said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jesse James said he robbed banks because that's where the money
was," Martino said. "Today the money is in health care, and these
people want it. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Martino said the Durascam investigation turned into the largest
undercover medical fraud inquiry in U.S. history because of its scope
and the number of investigators involved. About 500 law enforcement
agents and former agents took part, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just keeps snowballing," he said. "It's still a very valuable
operation, even though we shut down our clinic."</TE>
<TE>   In the overall state investigation, there have been 396 arrests so
far, in San Francisco, Sacramento and San Diego in addition to Los
Angeles, officials said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Nationwide we have an estimated $270 billion in fraudulent
medical claims, and $7.5 billion in California alone," said FBI
Assistant Director Ronald Iden, head of the bureau's Los Angeles
division. "We are announcing this to shed light on the problem and to
show the unprecedented cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Iden said FBI offices throughout the state are working with state
agencies as part of the California Health Care Fraud Task Force on
cases that include auto insurance fraud, false pharmacy billings, and
Medicare and Medi-Cal fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Two FBI investigations in Sacramento have focused on phony drug
prescriptions and durable medical equipment orders that bilked
Medi-Cal for prescription drugs at retail and wholesale levels.</TE>
<TE>   One of those operations, called Phony Pharm, focused on
pharmacists who billed Medi-Cal for drugs or equipment that were
never dispensed or prescribed. That led to revelations that some
wholesale drug companies were helping dishonest retailers by giving
them phony invoices for bulk orders they never actually placed.</TE>
<TE>   A third Sacramento investigation targeted phony bills to Medicare
and Medi-Cal for blood work and lab tests that never occurred or were
unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said 21 arrests have been made in connection with
more than $50 million in the lab fraud investigation there. The other
Sacramento investigations have led to 145 convictions and
court-ordered restitution of about $48 million.</TE>
<TE>   "When scam artists exploit our health care system, we all pay the
price through higher insurance costs and misspent government funds,"
said John C. Eckenrode, acting head of the FBI's Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, investigators focused on staged automobile accidents
involving a fraud ring that operated throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The ring staged accidents in San Diego, Los Angeles and San
Francisco, then had the drivers report false injury claims. That led
to 51 convictions--including those of five chiropractors and seven
lawyers and law office administrators--in connection with 11 staged
car collisions.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, another investigation centered on the sale of
fraudulent health care plans. The owner of a firm called Interstate
Services was charged with 53 counts of money laundering for allegedly
selling health care plans that never paid off and embezzling the
premiums.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Bruce J. Gebhardt, head of the FBI's San
Francisco office, said the joint effort was highly productive.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really made a point of looking at all the FBI offices here
as one so we could attack the problem from all fronts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI worked with the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Defense
Criminal Investigative Service and U.S. attorney's offices throughout
the state.</TE>
<TE>   State agencies involved in the continuing investigations include
the attorney general's office, the California Bureau of Medi-Cal
Fraud and the state Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get the message out that we are going to continue to
go after these people," Iden said. "Ultimately, the costs are paid by
all of us."</TE>

<HD>Foundation Spreads Word on Health Care</HD>
<DH>Outreach: Effort aims to increase coverage for low-income
families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Endowment launched a five-year, $20-million initiative
Thursday to increase health-care coverage for low-income Los Angeles
County families through outreach programs geared to ethnic
minorities.</LD>
<LD>   Schools, small businesses and community-based organizations will
be the main channels through which California's largest health-care
foundation will seek to boost enrollment in the state's Medi-Cal and
Healthy Families programs.</LD>
<LD>   "It was clear that culturally appropriate approaches were critical
to the success of addressing the problem," said Robert K. Ross,
president of the California Endowment. "We felt that this county,
being the melting pot of California, was a great place to test these
strategies."</LD>
<TE>   The endowment plans to make the initiative a model for similar
grants in other counties to reach the state's estimated 768,000
uninsured children who qualify for either Medi-Cal or Healthy
Families, both of which are government-sponsored. Healthy Families is
a program for children whose parents make too much money to qualify
for Medi-Cal but not enough to buy private health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative will target Central, South and East Los Angeles, El
Monte and the east San Fernando Valley. Working with institutions
such as schools and places of worship, the endowment will try to
educate families, simplify enrollment processes and eliminate
immigration-related concerns, Ross said. Parents sometimes worry
about signing youngsters up for coverage for fear of endangering the
immigration prospects of other family members.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer said that
schools are excellent agencies to enroll students in health care and
that expanded coverage is essential for academic success.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids can't learn unless they're healthy," Romer said. "If their
eyes, their teeth, their bodies are not functioning, it obviously
affects their ability to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Tying insurance enrollment to participation in schools' free and
reduced-cost lunch programs is crucial to expanding children's
access, Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   "In our grandest notion we'd love to see the term 'unenrolled but
eligible' as an anachronism," Ross said. "I'm not sure we'll ever get
that far, but certainly I think we can put a dent in that number."</TE>
<TE>   The initiative will also triple the budget of VIDA, a San Fernando
Valley project that links low-income families to providers and health
education; the organization will receive a grant totaling $2.5million
during the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   With the increasing funding, VIDA plans to increase enrollment of
San Fernando Valley families from 800 to 1,200. It also intends to
expand its program into the San Gabriel Valley with a new project
focused on training health-care promoters.</TE>

<HD>Center Will Study Genocide</HD>
<DH>Education: Claremont McKenna College will examine the
Holocaust, other atrocities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAM NOLES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A center dedicated to the study of the Holocaust and other atrocities
was announced Thursday at Claremont McKenna College.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human
Rights will examine "not just World War II and what happened to Jews
and Gypsies and other victims," said Jonathan Petropoulos, history
professor and director of the Gould Center for Humanistic Studies.
"It's comparative. It's looking at ... Rwanda, Cambodia. We hope the
scholarship will help prevent such tragedies in the future."</LD>
<LD>   Although the center has been officially established, the college
will seek $6 million in grants and donations to host conferences,
create an endowed chair, bring in specialists and publish scholarly
texts. The center will be based at Claremont McKenna, but use
resources from all the Claremont Colleges.</LD>
<TE>   "This would be a chance to institutionalize the work already done
by many [individual] faculty members," said John Roth, a philosophy
professor and Holocaust historian.</TE>
<TE>   The center was announced at "The Future of Holocaust Education,
Holocaust Studies and Post-Holocaust Justice," a symposium that
included some of the top scholars and officials in the field.</TE>
<TE>   One of those was Stuart Eizenstat, the Clinton administration's
special envoy on Holocaust reparations issues who negotiated
compensation agreements with Switzerland, France, Germany and
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Of the center, he said: "There are many Holocaust courses today in
contrast to the 1950s, '60s, '70s, but there are precious few
academic centers looking at the Holocaust as a whole across academic
lines."</TE>
<TE>   Studying the Holocaust through the lenses of history, sociology,
political science, psychology and other disciplines can help teach
about the possibilities of humanity's future, Eizenstat said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Holocaust is one of those rare issues that looms larger and
seems more relevant the further away you are from it," he said. "It
represents a sort of evil incarnate that leads one to study a variety
of things. What could lead a country like Germany ... to have done
such a thing? And what does that say about societies in the future?"</TE>
<TE>   Sara Bloomfield, executive director of the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum, said world events show that the issues at the root
of the Holocaust still need to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the important lessons of the Holocaust is we seem not to
have learned the lessons of Holocaust," she said.</TE>

<LD>   The confidential 32-page report by Inspector General Jeffrey C.
Eglash criticizes Chief Bernard C. Parks and his chief of staff,
Deputy Chief David J. Gascon, for failing to "meet their
responsibility of providing accurate and complete information to the
commission at all times."</LD>
<LD>   "This case highlights a failure of communication between the chief
of police and members of his command staff that resulted in the
commission not knowing facts relevant to ... the shooting at issue,"
Eglash wrote in a summary of his investigation.</LD>
<TE>   The shooting in question occurred Feb. 8, 1999, and involved a
pair of officers known on the streets of the LAPD's Southeast
Division as "Batman and Robin."</TE>
<TE>   During the incident, Officer William Ferguson, known as Batman,
fired two shots at a 14-year-old who allegedly pointed a gun at him
through the window of crack house. Both shots missed.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission, based on a recommendation by Parks,
concluded in February 2000 that the shooting was within department
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months later, commissioners learned from a report in The
Times that department officials had not disclosed important details
about the shooting prior to the commission's vote, including the fact
that the officers were under investigation for allegedly having
planted a weapon at the scene. Commissioners were also unaware that
investigators had served a search warrant on Ferguson's locker
shortly after the shooting and discovered a replica weapon that one
detective believed was "to be used as planted evidence," according to
a search warrant affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   While Eglash's report, which was obtained by The Times, said his
investigation uncovered information suggesting that Parks may have
known that relevant facts were not shared with the commission, he
concluded there was "no direct evidence" to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Eglash concluded that the department's investigation
of the shooting was so badly botched, leaving so many unanswered
questions, that it would be pointless for the commission to
re-evaluate its original finding that the shooting broke no LAPD
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Lead Investigator's Work Criticized</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's report also condemned the department's
shooting investigation as "incomplete, conclusory and inaccurate, in
part." The lead detective's work in the investigation was
characterized as "uninformative and unreliable."</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who was recently denied a second five-year term in office,
and Gascon, who is seen as a potential candidate to replace Parks,
both declined to comment for this report.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member commission is expected to discuss the inspector
general's report in closed session within the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The report is one in a long series of LAPD analyses by Eglash that
have put him at odds with senior Police Department officials. Parks
has often dismissed the inspector general's work as incomplete or
biased, a sentiment shared by other top-ranking LAPD officers but not
by some of the department's most prominent critics.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of the house where the shooting took place immediately
disputed the officers' version of events, describing a dramatically
different encounter in which the police banged on their doors and
windows and shouted out rival gang slogans.</TE>
<TE>   A young woman claimed that as she attempted to flush a tray full
of rock cocaine down the toilet, an officer appeared in the bathroom
window and ordered her to stop. When she kept flushing down the
drugs, she claimed, the officer shot her, the bullet grazing her
head.</TE>
<TE>   An apparent gunshot immediately followed by a woman screaming is
captured on an audiotape of a 911 call made by someone inside the
house that night. None of the officers present claimed to have fired
the shot or to have heard it, according to police documents.</TE>
<TE>   The woman's allegation, made on the night of the shooting, was not
addressed in the officer-involved shooting team's investigation.</TE>
<TE>   By the time internal affairs investigators interviewed the woman
months later, the house had burned down.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, several witnesses accused the police of
planting a gun in the house to justify their actions.</TE>
<TE>   According to Eglash, the lead investigator in the case, Det.
Wallace Montgomery, "did not conduct a thorough investigation, and at
times, overstated the evidence" in favor of the police. Montgomery,
Eglash added, "ignored any evidence that raised questions about his
theory and similarly ignored the statements of the civilian
witnesses."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery, in a brief interview with The Times, disputed the
inspector general's findings. "I disagree. Period," Montgomery said.
The detective declined to comment further, saying he was under orders
from the chief not to discuss any officer-involved shooting with
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Eglash's specific orders from the Police Commission were to
determine whether important information was withheld from the
commission; whether there was sufficient new information for
commissioners to change their initial assessment that the shooting
was within departmental rules; and whether any department policies
should be changed as a result of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   After a five-month investigation, Eglash concluded that there was
"no doubt" that "relevant and material" information known by top
department officials was not shared with the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he concluded there were still too many questions left
unanswered to determine what occurred that night. As a result, he
said, there is not enough evidence to support a revision of the
commission's initial "in-policy" finding.</TE>
<TE>   As for policy changes, Eglash noted that the department already
was developing a new protocol aimed at prioritizing investigations
dealing with potential criminal conduct by officers during police
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the inspector general's report dealt with what police
officials knew about the shooting and when they knew it.</TE>
<TE>   One important issue was whether Parks or Deputy Chief Gascon were
aware that there was a pending criminal case against Ferguson and
Officer Jeffrey Robb at the time the Police Commission was asked to
review the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   After the inquiry was disclosed in The Times last August, both men
told commissioners they were unaware of any such investigation,
according to Eglash's report.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general, however, concluded that "it appears that
Deputy Chief Gascon was aware that Officers Ferguson and Robb had
been referred to the district attorney's office for prosecution prior
to the adjudication of the shooting."</TE>
<TE>   That finding was based largely on a handwritten memo by Cmdr.
James S. McMurray, who was then in charge of the LAPD's internal
affairs division.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, dated Nov. 30, 1999, McMurray indicates that he
briefed Gascon on the fact that the district attorney's office had
requested a copy of the LAPD's shooting investigation report as part
of a criminal investigation of Ferguson and Robb. McMurray also wrote
in the memo that he provided a copy of the district attorney's
request for the shooting report to Gascon to forward to Parks.</TE>
<TE>   That was two months before the Police Commission was presented
with Parks' recommendation that the shooting be found "in policy."</TE>
<TE>   Claim of Planted Gun Addressed</TE>
<TE>   Eglash's report also addressed the statements of an LAPD sergeant
who claimed he witnessed Ferguson plant a gun inside the house after
the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   According to Eglash, Sgt. Warren "Ken" Brooks has made at least
five statements--to LAPD officials and the inspector general's
staff--about what he saw the night on the shooting, and all of those
statements were "different in material respects." As a result, Eglash
concluded, Brooks' statements were not credible.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the city agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle a civil
rights lawsuit against Ferguson, Robb, the LAPD and the city. The
suit alleged, among other things, that the shooting was unjustified
and covered up, and that Ferguson and Robb later framed two young men
on drug charges a week after the shooting in the house where it took
place.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ferguson and Robb declined to testify in the civil case,
citing their constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
Lawyers for both officers have said they deny any wrongdoing in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Facing disciplinary action, Robb resigned from the LAPD in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, who was arrested five times on felony charges before he
was hired by the LAPD, is suspended without pay.</TE>
<TE>   He is also a suspect in a string of robberies of drug dealers
along with his friend and former LAPD Officer Ruben Palomares, who
recently pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in San
Diego.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Commuters Share Electric Cars</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Pilot program lets train riders use the
vehicles to get to and from Irvine station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An experimental program that lets rail commuters use a motor pool of
electric cars at the Irvine train station was unveiled Thursday by a
consortium involving UC Irvine, local government and private
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot project, the largest of its kind in the country, allows
employees of participating corporations to share 50 low-emission
vehicles for trips to and from the Irvine Transportation Center and
for errands during the workday.</LD>
<LD>   Under the shared-use concept, a commuter from Riverside who works
for a company in Irvine can arrive at the transportation center in
the morning, pick out a car and drive to work. While the worker is on
the job, the vehicle can be used to run errands.</LD>
<TE>   At the end of the day, the employee drives back to the train
station, leaving the car for other participants--perhaps
later-arriving commuters returning from Los Angeles who will use the
vehicle to get home.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, those commuters will return the car to the
transportation center to keep the cycle going.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists can recharge the electric vehicles at the train station
by drawing power from solar panels and fuel cells.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new transportation strategy. It is not a substitute for
freeway commuting. It is an alternative to freeway commuting," said
G. Scott Samuelsen, director of UCI's National Fuel Cell Research
Center, which will manage the program.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Zev-Net for its use of zero-emission vehicles, the
public-private partnership has leased about a third of its vehicles
to three companies in the Irvine Spectrum area--Orthodyne
Electronics, CTG Energetics and Quantum.</TE>
<TE>   The rest are expected to be leased in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   If the program runs smoothly, there are plans to expand the fleet
to almost 200 vehicles placed at half a dozen train stations in
Orange and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Zev-Net participants get a choice of three Toyota vehicles--an
electric RAV, a small sport-utility vehicle; a Prius sedan that
combines a conventional gasoline engine with an electric motor; and
the egg-shaped E-Com, an urban runabout with two seats.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses can lease two of the cars for $5,000 a year or four
vehicles for $10,000 a year. Because of the relatively high cost, the
program so far is being offered only to employers, not individuals.</TE>
<TE>   "While the automobile has provided freedom and mobility, it also
has taken a heavy toll--congestion, pollution and oil dependency,"
said J. Davis Illingsworth, a senior vice president at Toyota Motor
Sales USA. "We need to take action. This is part of the solution."</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Transportation Center was selected as home base for the
pilot program because of its location in the Irvine Spectrum business
district.</TE>
<TE>   All Zev-Net cars will be equipped with electronic tracking devices
to monitor their use, and diagnostic sensors to alert a UCI control
center of any breakdowns or mechanical problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Using public transportation has been viewed as punishment," said
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, whose city is participating in the venture.
"This should make commuting safe and enjoyable."</TE>
<TE>   Shared-use programs with zero- or low-emission vehicles have been
started in other parts of the country, such as Flex-Car in Seattle
and Zip-Car in Boston. Atlanta is planning the Motion and Mobility
project.</TE>
<TE>   In California, automakers participating in programs like Zev-Net
can earn credits toward fulfilling state requirements that,
eventually, 10% of all cars sold in California be zero-emission
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Samuelsen said the demonstration project will last at least three
years and provide a good opportunity for researchers to address
transportation problems through computer technology, the latest
electric vehicles and the shared-use concept.</TE>
<TE>   Zev-Net involves Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., the city of Irvine,
the Irvine Co., the Orange County Transportation Authority and the
California Air Resources Board. Among the partners from UCI is the
Institute of Transportation Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "This program will demonstrate how we can use technology to clean
our air, help cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce our dependency
on petroleum products all at the same time," said Alan C. Lloyd,
chairman of the California Air Resources Board.</TE>

<HD>Mahony Takes His Message to Airwaves</HD>
<DH>Religion: The cardinal, slow to react publicly to sex-abuse
crisis, regains his media-savvy ways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when an alternative newspaper pictured him on its cover with
a zipper locking his lips, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony settled in for a
series of media interviews Thursday to get the word out that he is
committed to taking direct action against sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't unusual for Mahony to grant interviews. He's viewed as
one of the most media-savvy bishops in the Roman Catholic Church and
sits on a pontifical council on social communications. Pope John Paul
II once called him "Hollywood" for short.</LD>
<LD>   But like other bishops buffeted by a sexual-abuse scandal that has
shaken the church in America, Mahony initially faltered in
responding. When The Times first disclosed that Mahony had fired or
retired six to 12 priests who had been accused of sexual abuse in the
past, the cardinal refused to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Several weeks later, he conceded that "a few" priests had been let
go. But he told The Times during an April 3 interview that the
newspaper's source was so off the mark "that I'm embarrassed for him
and for you."</TE>
<TE>   Then Mahony's private e-mails were leaked to the media, revealing
that he had fired eight priests, forcing him to respond specifically.
That was followed by a series of revelations involving priests in his
own archdiocese and several missteps with law enforcement over the
extent to which the church had cooperated in disclosing the names of
accused priests.</TE>
<TE>   And so on Thursday, in an attempt to address the issue on his own
terms, Mahony invited nine television stations and two all-news radio
stations to the new Cathedral Conference Center. Reporters lined up
for 10 minutes apiece to hear the cardinal unveil what he described
as a proactive plan to cut priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Tod, are you the one keeping the clock?" Mahony asked his
director of media relations, Tod Tamberg. Tamberg held up his
stopwatch.</TE>
<TE>   First up was Sylvia Lopez, anchor/reporter at KCAL-TV Channel 9.
Waiting for the camera to roll, she asked Mahony whether he had
spoken about sexual abuse before. He told her he had had a recent
news conference, but felt that for a story like this, face-to-face
interviews were more effective.</TE>
<TE>   "A press conference just doesn't work," he said seconds before the
videotape rolled. "You don't get the clarity."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's decision to go to the media has been a defining
characteristic of his priesthood, whether marching with the late farm
labor organizer Cesar Chavez or dealing with child abuse. In the
series of private e-mails he wrote and received that were leaked to
the media, Mahony again showed himself to be keenly aware of public
perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   His approach sharply contrasted with that of Cardinal Bernard Law
of Boston, who not only avoided public appearances in his
archdiocese, but secretly flew to Rome to determine whether he still
had a job. He later said the Vatican asked him to remain.</TE>
<TE>   Law has been under unrelenting pressure to quit since allegations
that he and other bishops under him had knowingly transferred
pedophile priests from parish to parish. One of them was sent to San
Bernardino with a favorable recommendation from the Boston
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony stressed Thursday that he and the church were not only
deeply sorry for those who have been victimized in the past by
priests, but that he was taking specific and forward-looking steps to
guard against it happening again.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of strengthening his 10-year-old sexual abuse advisory
council to include more members of the laity, including a sexual
abuse victim. He talked about putting "child safe" programs in every
parish to protect youths from all kinds of threats, from Internet
pornography and sexual predators to kidnappers and, yes, priests.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, his hands clasped on his lap, spent the afternoon sitting
5 feet from an identical chair in which a series of broadcast
reporters took turns asking questions. (Print reporters were allowed
to sit in and watch, but not to ask questions; Tamberg said
newspapers had already had their turn.)</TE>
<TE>   "We told [law enforcement] so many times, I think they're getting
tired of hearing from us," Mahony told TV reporter Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   He said the name of every priest suspected of sexually abusing
minors had been turned over to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Not satisfied, Lopez followed up, pressing him about a demand from
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley for full disclosure. Mahony was unfazed. "I
think if you actually talk to them now you'll see they actually are
working very closely with us," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony continued to say he would not reveal those same names
at the request of some victims.</TE>
<TE>   A case in point, Mahony said, was the accusation by a Fresno woman
that he had molested her more than 30 years ago. Fresno police later
concluded that there was no evidence to back up the woman. The woman
told reporters she had mental problems and had been diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony came to her defense in interviews Thursday and justified
his secrecy at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "The false allegation against myself is a good example of that
because the media went to that poor lady's front door. They put
microphones and cameras in her face, and I have to say, ridiculed
that poor lady. Victims said to me, 'Please don't let that happen to
us.'"</TE>
<TE>   Did he have regrets over how he and the church have handled the
scandal? Lopez asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Mahony said without hesitating. "If I had known in
1986 or '87 what I know in 2002, obviously we would have done things
differently." Then again, he said the church "relied very heavily" on
the recommendations of psychologists and others. "Their
recommendations today to us are far different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Grant, president of the Southern California chapter of the
Survivors' Network of Those Abused by Priests, was not convinced of
Mahony's sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   "Victims have been asking the cardinal to take actions like" the
ones Mahony is proposing "for 10 years now," she said. "Until now,
he's been able to slide by on his words. But now that his actions
have been exposed, he's trying to ... take action," Grant said in a
telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of two of the 11 interviews The Times was permitted to
observe, Mahony thanked the TV reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "Very good, Sylvia! You were excellent," he told Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen minutes later he had a parting comment for Miriam
Hernandez of KABC-TV Channel 7.  "Very good! Thank you! Very
professional!"</TE>

<HD>Gudeman Must Go, Consultant Says</HD>

<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled mental health director David Gudeman should be replaced as
part of a broader plan to alleviate chronic problems in Ventura
County's Behavioral Health Department, according to a consultant's
report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the pervasive dissatisfaction and lack of trust of the
current Behavioral Health administration ... it seems unlikely that
positive changes could be implemented and sustained without a change
in leadership," Dallas psychologist Melissa Cahill wrote in her
report.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned that troubled juveniles were not receiving needed mental
health services, Superior Court Judge John Dobroth earlier this year
asked Cahill to investigate the cause. Cahill is chief psychologist
for the Dallas County corrections department in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   After interviewing dozens of administrators, clinical staff and
others in the Ventura County's probation and mental health
departments, Cahill concluded that Behavioral Health officials put up
unnecessary roadblocks for youths seeking treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill also found that collaboration among county departments has
broken down because of distrust and that many Behavioral Health
employees are afraid to speak out for fear of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   "Several individuals would only disclose information after
significant questioning, while others would only do so when assured
anonymity," she wrote in the eight-page report.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment comes as the Board of Supervisors awaits
recommendations on Gudeman's future.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the board unanimously directed County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston to review Gudeman's three-year tenure as leader of
the $50-million, 450-employee department.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston is expected to offer his recommendations to supervisors
Tuesday behind closed doors. In recent days, Johnston has been
critical of Gudeman's performance.</TE>
<TE>   He could not be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman John Flynn declined to comment on Cahill's report,
saying he would wait to hear Johnston's recommendation. But
Supervisor Frank Schillo, a Gudeman ally, criticized it as a "hatchet
job."</TE>
<TE>   Cahill received her training in Texas and is not familiar with
California's mental health system, Schillo said. That makes her
conclusions suspect, the Thousand Oaks supervisor said. He also
questioned why Dobroth ordered the report in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The bench is way out of line here," Schillo said. "It's not their
problem to solve. And we already told them we're going to solve the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman said the report is a biased document by "someone from out
of state who is relatively junior in her career." Cahill earned a
doctoral degree in clinical psychology from the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   He disputed Cahill's contention that his employees are afraid to
speak out. All workers are aware of a hotline number they can call to
reach the federal inspector general's office in Washington if they
have a problem, Gudeman said.</TE>
<TE>   The line was activated following a 1998 federal investigation into
inappropriate Medicare billings in the mental health division.
Gudeman said one of Cahill's recommendations, to designate a
clinician in the Probation Agency as the liaison for mental health
services, is one he made two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes two to tango," Gudeman said. "You actually have to have
someone in probation with policy authority to integrate the services.
And it should be a doctor because a lot of services involve
medication."</TE>
<TE>   Dobroth had threatened earlier this month to order the county to
provide services after Gudeman initially balked at providing
psychiatric treatment for a teenager sentenced to a Camarillo work
program. The order was averted, however, when Gudeman and Probation
Agency chief Cal Remington worked out an agreement to treat the
youth.</TE>

<HD>Newhall Ranch Loses a Battle</HD>
<DH>Housing: State Supreme Court upholds ruling that requires
one of the project's water suppliers to submit a new environmental
report. Developer calls the setback 'negligible.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The largest residential development in the history of Los Angeles
County has hit another legal snag over water supply that could
further delay construction.</LD>
<LD>   The state Supreme Court refused to interfere with a lower court
decision that set aside the transfer of 41,000 acre-feet of water
each year from the Kern County Water Agency to the Castaic Lake Water
Agency, which would supply a portion of water to Newhall Ranch, a
proposed 21,600-home subdivision in the Santa Clarita Valley.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court ruling found that the Castaic Lake Water Agency's
environmental report was inadequate and needed to be revised, agency
spokeswoman Mary Lou Cotton said.</LD>
<TE>   Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. plans to use about 1,600 acre-feet from
Castaic annually for its development that is expected to bring 70,000
new residents to the burgeoning Santa Clarita Valley. An acre-foot is
326,000 gallons, about enough water to supply two average families
for a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a small percentage of the water sources that we have
projected rely on CLWA supplies," said Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman
for Newhall Land. "In terms of the impact the court decision will
have on Newhall Ranch, it's very negligible."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents Applaud Ruling</TE>
<TE>   Lauffer has said that the developer has conducted more than 30
studies and has deals to buy and store enough water to meet nearly
twice the expected demand.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the development applauded the high court's decision
Tuesday because they said it underscores that water availability and
residential development must go hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is great news," said Barbara Walpole, president of
the citizens group Friends of the Santa Clara River. "This is
important because we believe it is among the reasons why Los Angeles
County is postponing a decision on Newhall Ranch--until water-rights
issues are sorted out."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, has said that
the county must ensure that there is sufficient water for the
residents of the Santa Clarita Valley before any project is approved.</TE>
<TE>   "From the supervisor's perspective, we shouldn't be sticking a
shovel in the ground until we have a guaranteed water source out
there," said Antonovich's land-use deputy, Conal McNamara.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to delay action on Newhall
Ranch until its Aug. 27 meeting, McNamara said.</TE>

<LD>A former business associate of auto-racing legend Mickey Thompson was
ordered Thursday to stand trial in the 1988 murders of Thompson and
his wife.</LD>
<LD>   A judge found that there was enough evidence to try former racing
promoter Michael Goodwin, 57--who lost a bitter, two-year court
battle to Thompson, 59, before the execution-style killings--on two
counts of murder with special circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno ordered
Goodwin held without bail pending the outcome of his trial. He has
steadfastly maintained his innocence.</LD>

<LD>The California Supreme Court said Orange County prosecutors may
proceed with their case against a trash-hauling executive accused of
bilking residents of about $4.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The justices, ruling 6 to 1, rejected arguments from defendant
Jeffrey Hambarian, whose attorneys maintained that Orange County
prosecutors had a conflict of interest and could not prosecute him.</LD>
<LD>   Hambarian said that Orange County prosecutors could not try him
because an accountant who helped the city of Orange in the fraud case
is being retained by county prosecutors and city police in the case.</LD>

<HD>Attorney's Actions in Barbie Copyright Suit Fly in the Face
of Model Behavior</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has upheld a $500,000 sanction against an
L.A. attorney for "boorish" behavior that included throwing Barbies
around a conference room.</LD>
<LD>   The outburst was committed by James Hicks, who had lodged a
copyright suit against Mattel on behalf of the creator of a USC
cheerleader doll named Claudine.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which was later dismissed, claimed that several Barbies,
including CB Barbie, infringed on Claudine's copyright, the L.A.
Daily Journal reported.</LD>
<TE>   During a videotaped conference, Mattel lawyers tried to show Hicks
that the Barbies named in the suit bore printed copyrights on the
backs of their cute little heads that predated Claudine. Hicks
declined to inspect them, sending them into orbit instead.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to imagine that the Barbie doll, so perfect in
her sculpture and presentation, and so comfortable in every setting
... could spawn such acrimonious litigation and such egregious
conduct on the part of her challenger," wrote Judge Margaret McKeown.</TE>
<TE>   One question remains unanswered: Where was that dweeb Ken while
all this was going on?</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of USC cheerleaders (the human Barbies): Men who
graduated from USC before 1970, such as myself, may recall with some
bitterness that it was then one of the few major universities that
banned female cheerleaders. Rumor had it that some old fogey had left
money to the school on the condition that all the cheerleaders be
guys. The policy was changed a few years after my (1967) departure.
It's a wonder USC could recruit top male athletes before then.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the explanation: A reader sent in a photo of a South
African bar where the manager doesn't seem very communicative.</TE>
<TE>   Observing lint: "Thought you might enjoy the instructions that
came with a lint remover roller," wrote Wayne and Bonnie Cuddeback of
Sylmar (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   "We have mixed emotions as to whether we should use it. On the one
hand, we would like to have a brand new clean circumstance, but on
the other hand, we fear having the surface of our clothes torn off!"</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Gary Scheidt of Pasadena saw an ad for a
mechanic who can help those trying to cut down on bread (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: As The Times' Bob Pool wrote the other day, local TV
crews covering the appearance of L.A. Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
before the City Council were upset about the facilities at the
renovated City Hall. With the new setup, it's difficult for the
stations to broadcast live from the building. I can understand how
this situation would have developed, though. Who would have ever
thought that anyone would want to see live coverage of a City Council
session?</TE>

<HD>Parks Begins Packing, Prepares to Go on Vacation</HD>

<LD>One day after the Los Angeles City Council voted to deny him a second
term, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks began packing up personal items
in his office Thursday and prepared to go on vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, whose term expires in August, said he will leave Deputy
Chief Mike Bostic in charge of the Los Angeles Police Department
while he is away. He did not say how long he plans to be on vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Parks is expected to announce on Monday whether he will serve out
the remainder of his term. He also is considering taking legal action
against the city.</LD>
<TE>   Parks' decision to begin packing caught some officials at City
Hall by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I would certainly hope it's not a real retirement at this point,"
said Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. "I would like to see him stay on
through the end of his contract. I think it would be helpful for the
city to have his knowledge, rather than have an interim chief and
then a new chief."</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 11 to 3 Wednesday not to overturn a Police
Commission decision that denied Parks a second five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners and some council members said Parks should not be
reappointed because crime has gone up during his tenure while officer
recruitment and morale have dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he believed he was a victim of a political conspiracy
between Mayor James K. Hahn and the police union. He said he decided
to start taking things home after the council made it clear that his
time was limited.</TE>
<TE>   As he filled cardboard boxes, tearful members of his staff stopped
by to wish him well, said Deputy Chief David Gascon, who was with
Parks for part of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very upbeat and reassuring for those well-wishers who
dropped by to talk to him," Gascon said. "It was very emotional for
those who stopped by."</TE>

<HD>Don't Kill the Umpire; Respect Him</HD>

<LD>To talk with him, Dan Edwards seems like a perfectly normal guy. He's
36, is married with four kids and owns a software business. He's a
reserve officer for the Garden Grove Police Department and, for what
it's worth, a pretty funny guy.</LD>
<LD>   So why in the world, I ask him, do you want to be a Pony League
and high school baseball umpire? Why would you want the abuse, the
aggravation, the antagonism--and all for a pittance in pay? In short,
what in the world is wrong with you?</LD>
<LD>   Edwards looks across the desk in his Fountain Valley office and
says, "That's a really good question. Now that you've got me thinking
about it, I don't know why!"</LD>
<TE>   He says it with a laugh, so I guess that means he's not quitting.
For one thing, he has been umpiring since he was a teenager, not
counting the 10 years or so he took off in his 20s and early 30s to
start his family. But he has been back in full swing the last few
years and plans to work about three games a week now that youth games
litter the baseball-rich Orange County landscape.</TE>
<TE>   But in an era in which goofy parents and coaches have perfected
the knack of turning enjoyable ballgames into anger-management
sessions, it amazes me that anyone would volunteer to be a potential
target. A friend of mine, who is in his early 50s and old enough to
know better, recently umpired his first softball game in a league for
8-year-old girls. Another friend on the East Coast has been umpiring
high school games for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Wondering if they knew what they were doing, I hooked up with
Edwards to find out why seemingly normal people get the urge to be an
ump.</TE>
<TE>   "I do it for the kids," Edwards says. "A lot of games I played in
high school, we had lousy umpires. I felt I was out there busting my
butt and getting called out at second base, and I can't even see the
umpire because he's so far away."</TE>
<TE>   By being a good umpire, Edwards says, he can enhance kids'
enjoyment of the game.</TE>
<TE>   If only parents and coaches saw it that way.</TE>
<TE>   An ump can have more problems with the younger age groups than at
the high school level, Edwards says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because the parents think their 8-year-old still has major
league dreams," he says. "By me calling him out on strikes, I've just
ruined his opportunity to play pro ball."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what I mean; I'm a cupcake and don't like to be
yelled at.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it does take a certain personality to say, 'I don't
care,'" Edwards says of the boo birds. "We're out there for the kids
to have fun. Unfortunately, parents get involved and ruin all that.
But I really couldn't care less what goes on behind the backstop."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards says clothes help make the ump. "A huge part of the battle
is dressing the part. I've probably got $500 to $1,000 of gear in the
back of my truck.... To get a chest protector I'd wear for a high
school game, you're looking at a 150 bucks."</TE>
<TE>   Little League umps work for free. Edwards belongs to the Orange
County Baseball Officials Assn., whose 150 umps get between $50 and
$60 for working high school games. Pony League umps make less.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure that's enough money, even three times a week, to put
up with certain coaches or parents. I ask Edwards if people are
nuttier than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I'm starting to see is, we're getting it now from the
kids," he says. "Not screaming, yelling or kicking dirt, but when I
played ball, you got called out, you got up and walked off the field.
Now, it's 'What do you mean?' They're going to get in two or three
words, too. It's not just Mom and Dad. That worries me."</TE>
<TE>   What age are you talking about? "Eleven and 12 years old," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, well. There's still plenty of good times, sunshine and the
connection with the grand old game itself.</TE>
<TE>   Hassles aside, it must be worth it or relatively sane people like
Edwards wouldn't hang in there.</TE>
<TE>   His method is to look past the prickly parent or coach.</TE>
<TE>   "The minute the game's over, I watch the kids," he says. "And by
watching the kids, you usually can't tell who won the game. All they
do is run out on the field, shake hands, roll around and get dirty
and race to the snack bar."</TE>

<HD>250 Rabbits Seized in Cruelty Case</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Raid of the Mar Vista home finds many of the
animals hurt and some dead.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A large strike force of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, carrying a search warrant, raided a rented home Thursday in
Mar Vista and removed more than 250 rabbits, many of them injured and
some dead.</LD>
<LD>   Madeline Bernstein, president of the SPCA's Los Angeles chapter,
said it appeared that the woman who lived there had begun "a
collection of rabbits and then allowed the animals to multiply
without control."</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors had complained of a stench.</LD>
<TE>   At least eight SPCA trucks and more than 20 people were involved
in the raid in the neighborhood on the Westside of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbits still alive were trucked either to a veterinarian's office
or a shelter. Bernstein said some would be offered for adoption.</TE>
<TE>   When SPCA workers arrived at the house in the 3000 block of Stoner
Avenue and showed the resident the search warrant, she left the
property, Bernstein said. She was not arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "A huge number of rabbits [were] found in the backyard and along
the sides of the house," Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The name of the resident was not released, but neighbors said she
had rented the home for a year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Lazarus Benjamin, a next-door neighbor, said he had noticed bad
smells for some time.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of rabbits discovered "was a shock," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein said Los Angeles ordinances regulating the sheltering of
rabbits are less clear than for dogs and cats but that rabbits must
be kept in healthful, clean surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "This person may have meant well," Bernstein said, "but things got
beyond her."</TE>

<HD>Blood in Truck Linked to Slain College Student, Experts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blood found inside a truck driven by murder suspect Vincent Sanchez
genetically matches DNA taken from slain Moorpark College student
Megan Barroso, forensic scientists testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Scientist Kristin Rogahn told a judge during Sanchez's preliminary
hearing on murder and related charges that she noticed a blood stain
inside the defendant's cab while examining the green Ford Ranger for
possible evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Rogahn, who works for the Ventura County Sheriff's Department
crime lab, took a sample of the blood, which was later matched
through DNA tests to Barroso.</LD>
<TE>   Scientist Shanin Sullivan, who also works for the crime lab,
testified that the odds were about one in a trillion that the blood
came from someone else.</TE>
<TE>   "The two profiles were identical," Sullivan testified.</TE>
<TE>   Although the truck upholstery appeared clean, blood was also
detected through chemical tests on the left side of the passenger
seat, the center console and beneath the seat, Rogahn testified.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Sanchez's brother testified he saw the defendant washing
the truck on July 5--the same day Barroso, 20, was reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   Her bullet-riddled car was found abandoned near a freeway
overpass, and her remains were recovered a month later in a canyon
near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Sanchez, a 31-year-old Simi Valley handyman,
shot the Moorpark woman, then kidnapped and sexually assaulted her
before she died. They are seeking the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys say there is no evidence of rape, however, and
have tried to show that Barroso could have died almost immediately
after being shot.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today in Ventura County Superior
Court.</TE>

<HD>Student Scientists Honored for Work</HD>
<DH>Education: Research on brain functions, blood vessel
infections win top medals at annual county science fair. The projects
are among 120 advancing to state competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Westwood seventh-grader who researched brain functions and a Palos
Verdes Peninsula 11th-grader who investigated blood vessel infections
won the top awards Thursday at the Los Angeles County Science Fair.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Weston, who attends St. Paul the Apostle School, and
Stephanie Lee, a student at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, won
the highest medals in the junior and senior divisions, respectively.</LD>
<LD>   They competed among 929 entries in the fair, held at the Los
Angeles Convention Center.</LD>
<TE>   The top two projects were also among six entries honored in each
of the fair's 20 themed categories. In all, 120 projects from Los
Angeles County will advance to the California State Science Fair on
May 20 and 21 at the California ScienCenter in Exposition Park.</TE>
<TE>   Michael, a freckled 13-year-old in a Billabong T-shirt and khakis,
shifted from foot to foot as he explained his behavioral science
project, which tested whether people tend to be right-, left- or
equally balanced.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was younger, people would say I was right-brained, and I
had no idea what they were talking about," he said, clutching a
miniature pink plastic brain. "I thought there was only one brain."</TE>
<TE>   In popular parlance, right-brained people tend to be artistic,
left-brained to be more analytical.</TE>
<TE>   Michael devised his own test and repeatedly gave it to 85 subjects
over seven months. His analysis found that people were fairly evenly
divided between the groups, although he also determined that most
courses at his school were oriented toward the left-brained.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard about families whose children went to schools that
didn't require science fair projects," said Michael's mother, Beverly
Weston. "For a while at the beginning [of his project], we were
really wishing we had sent Michael to one of those schools. But it
was worth it in the end to see how much Michael learned."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie's entry in the microbiology category attempted to
establish a new method to study a fungus that targets blood vessels,
particularly in people who have leukemia or diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer work at Torrance Memorial Hospital inspired the
16-year-old's project when she saw a patient with a mold-caused
illness.</TE>
<TE>   The first-time entrant started her project in July, when she began
interning at a UCLA medical research center.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to know what caused such a horrible infection," she
said. "When the science fair came up, I thought, 'Wow, this is my
chance to learn more about something I hardly know anything about.'"</TE>
<TE>   Her display included photos of mucus-swollen eyes and a weathered
blue journal that chronicles her project in small, neat writing.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie, who also writes for the school newspaper and is active
in the debate and math clubs, said she isn't sure if she wants to
pursue a career in medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "I just know I want to go to college somewhere far away where they
have four seasons," she said. "But as for right now, I'm just glad I
have the chance to continue my research for next year's fair."</TE>

<HD>Housing Subsidy Idea's Hard for Some to Live With</HD>
<DH>Government: Neighbors and a council candidate say Seal
Beach shouldn't finance a fourplex in a high-rent coastal district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A modest fourplex with fading pink paint is at the center of a storm
over how Seal Beach should spend its money and whether the city
should help low-income families move into an oceanfront neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Half a block from the beach, the building was owned for 30 years
by a Pasadena woman who used one unit as a seaside retreat and rented
out the other three.</LD>
<LD>   When she died last year, her estate put the property, at 1119
Ocean Ave., up for sale. An auction is scheduled for today in
Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   One prospective buyer is a Laguna Beach developer who approached
Seal Beach officials three months ago with a proposal: Use $400,000
in redevelopment funds to fix the place up and rent three of the four
apartments to people who qualify for housing subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   For city officials, who have $530,000 in redevelopment funds that
must be spent or forfeited by June 30, "it's kind of a win-win
situation," said Lee Whittenberg, the city's director of development
services. "The city gets to fix up an old building, and the
[subsidized] tenants end up with more expendable income."</TE>
<TE>   But the notion of rent subsidies in a neighborhood where houses go
for as much as $900,000 is not sitting well with some residents--for
a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Abe Michlin, who has lived a few doors down for 15 years, said,
"I'm in favor of the cause, but you'd get more bang for your buck in
another neighborhood. There are probably jillions of places on the
other side of PCH that would be more appropriate than this. It's a
misuse of the funds--I'd rather see them lose it than use it."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Antos, a county planner who lives nearby, said that if the
city subsidizes rents, "anybody can come in, just because they know
it's available and want to live near the beach. I think it's a scam."</TE>
<TE>   "People who come to Seal Beach," he said, "are choosing the
higher-rent area because they want to live near the beach, or they
want the quiet life and low crime rate and are willing to pay more
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Antos feels so strongly about the matter that he has made it an
issue in his race for City Council. He is in a May 14 runoff to
succeed Shawn Boyd, who lost a reelection bid last month. Boyd is
being investigated by the Orange County district attorney in
connection with his business ties to a man who bought a local trailer
park for $2.9 million in 1998, backed by city financing, and sold it
two years later for $7.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some see parallels to the Boyd case. "What would you think about
$400,000 of taxpayer money to help purchase a property?" asked Jim
Caviola, a lawyer who lives next to the pink building. "It's the same
thing that happens when wealthy people take advantage of the system
under the guise of helping poor people--all they do is end up
richer.... What it amounts to is white-collar crime."</TE>
<TE>   Whittenberg said $150,000 would go to the developer for repairs on
the fourplex, and $250,000 would be set aside for rent subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the one-bedroom units would be for households of two with
combined annual incomes of $72,550 or less. One would be for a
twosome earning up to $43,550 a year. The fourth unit would not be
affected.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants would be required to spend up to 30% of their gross
income for rent, which now ranges from $1,075 to $1,500 a month. The
current renters would have the option to apply for the subsidies,
Whittenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Bidders in today's estate auction, meanwhile, will have to offer
at least $704,000 to be in the running. John Janosik, attorney for
the estate, said heirs have accepted a bid of $670,000, but state
probate law requires the court to hear competing offers beginning
with an incremental jump of 5%.</TE>
<TE>   "In 20 years of practicing law, I can honestly say that I've never
had more activity on a property," Janosik said. "I've had numerous
calls from potential bidders. I anticipate that this will be the most
actively bid property with which I've ever been involved."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who turns in the winning bid, the Seal Beach City
Council on Monday will consider its stance on the proper use of
redevelopment funds, including rent subsidies. Residents promise a
big turnout to get their point across.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is for a blighted area," Caviola said. "This definitely
is not a blighted area."</TE>

<HD>Answering Protests, Retailer to Pull Line of T-Shirts That
Mock Asians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Amid mounting protests, college clothier Abercrombie
&amp; Fitch on Thursday said it will pull a line of T-shirts from stores
nationwide after complaints that they depict racist caricatures of
Asian Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The $25 T-shirts show cartoonish Asian characters with slanted
eyes and conical hats who serve as pitchmen for companies such as
restaurants, dry cleaners and bowling alleys.</LD>
<LD>   One portrays a man pulling a rickshaw with the words "Rick Shaw's
Hoagies and Grinders. Order by the foot. Good meat. Quick feet."
Another shows two Asian men at "Wong Brothers Laundry Service" and
carries the logo "Two Wongs Can Make it White."</LD>
<TE>   A&amp;F, which markets shorts, T-shirts and other casual apparel to
youths between the ages of 18 and 22, said it made the decision after
receiving "hundreds and hundreds" of complaints about the T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   The items have been on the shelves for nearly two weeks, but the
firestorm hit within the past couple of days, mostly a result of
rapid-fire e-mails delivered to dozens of people at once.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas D. Lennox, A&amp;F's senior manager of investor relations and
corporate communications, said the company decided to pull the
roughly five styles from its Web site and stores Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not, and never has been, our intention to offend anyone,"
Lennox said.</TE>
<TE>   "These graphic T-shirts were designed with the sole purpose of
adding humor and levity to our fashion line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Goulet, manager for customer services at the company's New
Albany, Ohio, headquarters, said A&amp;F would note in its catalog and
nationally circulated magazine that the shirts were no longer
available.</TE>
<TE>   But though complaints have been many, Goulet added that A&amp;F was
also receiving a sizable number of calls from people who wanted to
buy the shirts.</TE>
<TE>   At one Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store in San Francisco on Thursday,
sales of the shirts remained brisk and a man who identified himself
as a store manager said he had received no word from company
headquarters to stop selling the shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what the big problem is," he said. "The first
kid to come in and buy these shirts this week had the last name of
Wong."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, people rushed to rummage through shirts that filled a
table as though a Kmart blue-light special had just been announced.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if the shirts were selling well, one female clerk
responded, "Oh my Lord yes! We don't have any more in back stock.
They're jumping off the shelves."</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone was pleased. Asian American activists in San
Francisco picketed one downtown store Thursday evening and presented
a letter demanding that the shirts be pulled from shelves and that
the company publicly apologize.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the shirt line spread quickly this week via e-mail to
college campuses, including Stanford University and UC Irvine, where
students plan to discuss the matter at a meeting Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   The shirts were also a topic on several Bay Area-based Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's inappropriate for this company to make a profit
from these really negative, harmful and hurtful images of Asian
Americans doing work they have been historically forced to do," said
Jane Kim of the Chinatown Community Development Center.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kind of images we saw in California newspapers a
century ago. I think the company needs to do some major community
relations work," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they need to invest in some of the work the Asian community
is doing rather than peddling these really hateful images," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Goulet said Asian Americans misunderstood the marketing campaign,
which in the past has poked fun at women, Irish Americans and snow
skiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who buys our clothes knows we don't target any particular
race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We pretty much make fun of everybody. But if we've learned
anything from this it's that perhaps we need to get a little
community feedback before we rush to market," Goulet said.</TE>
<TE>   Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is familiar with controversy.</TE>
<TE>   But until this incident, most complaints came not from A&amp;F's
target young-adult customers, but from parents, who objected to what
they considered overly sexual images in store ads and marketing
materials.</TE>
<TE>   With this group of shirts, however, the company has angered some
of its core audience: college students.</TE>
<TE>   One of the shirts recently removed from the market shows a smiling
Buddha figure with the words "Buddha Bash: Get your Buddha on the
Floor."</TE>
<TE>   Another shows a caricature of an Asian man bowling, with the
words: "Wok-N-bowl."</TE>
<TE>   "The Buddha is a religious icon that's central to the Asian
culture," said Kim.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes us so angry is that even if they say they're going to
pull these shirts from the shelves, the images are already out there.
The damage has been done," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Started in 1892 with one store in New York City, Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch has grown into a national chain with $1.3 billion in annual
sales in 311 stores--31 in California, three of which are in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At A&amp;F's store on Market Street in San Francisco, customer Henry
Kemp shook his head in disbelief as shoppers bought as many as half a
dozen of the shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "It smacks of Charlie Chan and the coolie stereotype," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe that anyone would buy these shirts, especially in
this politically correct town," Kemp said.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Noli, whose company offers seminars on racism at Bay Area
public high schools, was buying several of the shirts to use in her
demonstrations. "It's outrageous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When people say there's no longer any overt racism today, all I
have to do is pull out one of these T-shirts," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "How could a company be so insensitive in the year 2002 to think
this kind of smear campaign could fly?"</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Kemp sarcastically told a salesclerk: "Hey, why not start
a whole theme with T-shirts that insult every race? You people could
become instant millionaires!"</TE>
<TE>   As he bought several of the shirts, Derek Clark said the critics
needed to lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm buying these for my Asian friends, and we may wear them on
our bowling team this year," he said. "I mean, please, everybody gets
picked on these days. Why should Asian Americans be any different?"</TE>
<TE>   Lela Lee, a 27-year-old Los Angeles cartoonist best known for her
"Angry Little Asian Girl" character and merchandise, said images like
the ones on A&amp;F's shirts inspire her work.</TE>
<TE>   "We're used to depictions of Asians as kung-fu fighting,
fortune-cookie-speaking, slanty-eyed, bucktooth servants," she said.
"We're really tired of it."</TE>

<KH>ON THE LAW</KH>
<HD>Putting It on Record, With a Human Touch</HD>
<DH>Court reporters who use stenographs to record proceedings
have so far survived challenge of tapes and CD-ROMs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Court stenographer Lena Villegas runs a continuous narrow strip of
paper swiftly through her fingers, reading from it as easily as if it
were newsprint.</LD>
<LD>   "Koupbl aou phaeu teupb w kwror tkrebgt," reads the paper.</LD>
<LD>   "Counsel, you may continue with your direct," Villegas translates
aloud.</LD>
<TE>   Years of training and experience have made Villegas, 54, a master
of stenotype shorthand, which is used to record the proceedings in
courts across the country. Villegas, who works in the federal
district courthouse in Los Angeles, types at a rate of 225 words per
minute and can instantly decipher her notes and read them back to the
judge.</TE>
<TE>   Villegas' fingers lightly tap the small keyboard on her stenograph
machine, hitting several keys at once to produce clusters of letters
that spell out words in phonetic shorthand.</TE>
<TE>   A baffling sight to the untrained eye, stenography dominates the
field of court reporting. Two other methods of creating an official
court record share the playing field: mechanical recording devices
and stenomasking, in which a person softly repeats everything said in
court into a mask that is hooked up to a recording device.</TE>
<TE>   Stenographers, commonly known as court reporters, use a keyboard
with only 25 keys (there are about 100 on a standard computer
keyboard) that account for just 13 consonants and four vowels. It's
designed so that any syllable can be written with a single stroke,
with different fingers responsible for different parts of each
syllable. The left hand types the beginning sound, usually a
consonant, at the same time that the thumbs hit the appropriate vowel
keys and the right hand types the syllable's end sound.</TE>
<TE>   Letters on the keyboard's left side represent the sounds that most
commonly begin syllables, and those on the right most frequently end
syllables. There are three keys for the letter S because it is used
so often, but none for letters such as C, M and N. Letters that don't
appear on the keyboard are represented through a combination of
existing letters.</TE>
<TE>   A complicated system, yes. But one perfected over the years so
that the least amount of "finger travel" is required to take down all
the sounds of the English language.</TE>
<TE>   Seasoned court reporters say their skill eventually becomes second
nature. "You're able to think about something else while it's going
in your ears and coming out your fingers," says Arnella Sims, who
works in the Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Sims admits she sometimes thinks about her shopping list while
working, albeit fleetingly. Most of the time, however, she tunes into
the drama of the courtroom. Some lawyers consider her a "13th juror"
and ask how they are doing, she says. She never divulges her opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The stenograph machine was invented in the late 1800s, pitting
machine against pen-wielding man. The device went mainstream after a
national contest in 1914 in which several teenagers trained on
shorthand machines consistently beat professional "pen writers,"
according to one historical account.</TE>
<TE>   Modern court stenography has in turn been threatened by sound
recording, which has gained prominence in the last two decades. In
California, stenographers have warded off the electronic alternative
by lobbying the Legislature, using the argument that their method is
the most fail-proof. They've also adopted some of the best aspects of
modern technology while holding fast to their traditional technique.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles County Superior Court system, only 2% of the
courtrooms use electronic recording devices. State law allows the
system only for limited proceedings, including misdemeanor
arraignments. In federal court, it's up to the judge. Three out of 27
judges in the Los Angeles branch of the U.S. District Court use
electronic recording devices.</TE>
<TE>   The latest technology in court recording is a digital device that
records onto CD-ROMs, an improvement on the older dual-cassette
system. The device is monitored by a person who logs the proceeding
and can play the recording back for all in the courtroom to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Some judges say the instant playback feature eliminates
controversy about the record, which is sometimes called into question
by lawyers. "When you have a court reporter, they have to read [the
record] and the judge has to sit there and decide what the correct
read-back is," says U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian.</TE>
<TE>   With the electronic recording, a challenger is confronted by his
or her own voice, unfiltered by a reporter's interpretation of what
was said. "The tape doesn't lie," Tevrizian says.</TE>
<TE>   Court reporters concede that they do sometimes make mistakes, but
they insist that theirs is still the most reliable system. They point
out that a machine can't distinguish between testimony and background
noise, nor can it ask for clarification when a person fails to speak
clearly or uses obscure or specialized terminology. "It's going to be
a helluva computer that can sort that out," says Marshall Jorpeland
of the Virginia-based National Court Reporters Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In order to stay competitive in this high-tech age, about half of
all court reporters in the country have mastered a system called
real-time reporting. Real-time uses computer software to instantly
translate stenographic machine shorthand into English, which is then
relayed to computer screens in front of judges and, sometimes,
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The translation software was originally developed to ease the task
of creating readable transcripts from a reporter's notes. But
reporters now are using it to do something they say no machine can
do: provide instant transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do with a tape?" Jorpeland asks. "You have to
transcribe it. It doesn't type itself."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. Judicial Conference approved a 10% salary
increase for federal court reporters trained in real-time. Los
Angeles County also gives its real-time reporters bonus pay.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such advances, veteran court reporters say they are
puzzled by the slight decline in the number of new reporters in the
state. Eight years ago, there were 40 court-reporting schools in
California, according to the California Official Court Reporters
Assn. As of last October, the number of schools had dropped to 18.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't quite know why there are less people interested in going
into court reporting," says Gary Cramer, a veteran reporter and
executive director of the Los Angeles County Court Reporters Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say the work is demanding, but fulfilling and lucrative.
Los Angeles County Superior Courts offer a starting salary of
$64,000. Federal court reporters start out at $58,000. Full-time
reporters can earn tens of thousands of dollars a year beyond their
base pay by selling their transcripts (at about $3 per page) to
lawyers and other interested parties.</TE>
<TE>   The best part of the work, many say, is the pride taken in
producing an accurate account of a legal proceeding, something to
which every defendant is entitled. Cases are reviewed daily and
decisions affirmed or overturned based on court reporters'
transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is one of the most important because we're creating the
record that can be looked at for many years to come," says Sims, who
worked the preliminary hearings in the McMartin preschool molestation
case in the mid-1980s and the O.J. Simpson murder case several years
later.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after 26 years, the job is not stale and it's not routine,"
Sims says. "We're required to keep up with current events, because
the world comes into the courtroom."</TE>

<HD>Mass Transit Use in State Up 6% Last Year</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Figures from study reflect a national
trend. But one critic calls rise 'anemic.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mass transit systems throughout the state, including bus and rail
lines in Southern California, enjoyed a 6% increase in ridership last
year, reflecting a nationwide growth in transit use, according to a
newly released study.</LD>
<LD>   Though transit advocates touted the increase as a sign that the
state's continuing investment in mass transit is finally paying off,
critics noted that the small boost does not reflect a significant
change in overall commuting habits.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of Californians who drive alone has remained mostly
unchanged for nearly a decade, about 70%. Trips on mass transit
represent only 5% of all transportation in the state.</LD>
<TE>   "You are talking about a small percentage change on a very small
share of all miles traveled," said state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), who has long supported investing more in the
state's overburdened freeway system. He called the increase "anemic."</TE>
<TE>   Even transit advocates acknowledge that the increase could be
partly because of a growing population and demographic changes. Other
factors, such as the monthlong strike of bus drivers in Los Angeles
County in 2000, could explain why ridership numbers for 2001 were
greater.</TE>
<TE>   Still, several transportation experts viewed the rise as a
positive sign.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, transit ridership has increased gradually since 1996,
according to the American Public Transportation Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In California, ridership grew in 2001 by 5.9% or 73.5 million
trips, according to the report by the Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a nonprofit agency that advocates improved mass transit use.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Barbara McCann said the increase shows that
Californians are willing to use mass transit if government continues
to make such systems fast and convenient.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start to have quality transit, people choose it,'' she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that the two agencies with the largest reported
ridership increases were commuter rail services in Northern
California that serve commuters who would otherwise drive to work.</TE>
<TE>   Eight of the 10 transit agencies that reported the highest growth
rates were in Southern California. The Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's ridership grew from 377.6 million in 2000 to 435 million
in 2001, an increase of 15.2%, according to the study. That increase
accounts for 57 million of the state's 73.5 million gain in
ridership.</TE>
<TE>   But transportation officials noted that the MTA bus strike in fall
2000 lowered the overall ridership that year, making the numbers for
2001 seem even higher. For 32 days, more than 4,000 MTA drivers
refused to get behind the wheel, bringing the nation's second-largest
transit system to a grinding halt.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 increase in ridership for the MTA can also be attributed
to several expansion projects.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Line subway system that starts in downtown Los Angeles was
expanded from Hollywood to its final stop in North Hollywood in 2000,
at a cost of $1.3 billion. Daily ridership on the system jumped from
63,750 in March 2000 to 119,000 in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   MTA spokesman Rick Jager said the increase proves that the more
convenient and efficient a transit system is, the more people will
choose it over driving on congested freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "People are sampling the system and finding that it can work," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Agency Blames Landowner for Uprooting 301 Oaks</HD>
<DH>Environment: The real estate broker says he was framed. He
may be fined $300,000 to nearly $3 million for the trees near Lake
Casitas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite his impassioned claims that he was framed because of ethnic
prejudice, an Egyptian American real estate broker was held
responsible by county officials Thursday for the destruction of 301
protected oaks on his property outside Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for William Kaddis said his client will appeal the
county Planning Commission's ruling to the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors. Earlier this week, Kaddis sued the county, contending
that county employees trespassed on his 44 hillside acres near Lake
Casitas to build a case against him.</LD>
<LD>   The penalty for Kaddis' violation could run from $300,000 to
nearly $3 million, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In an emotional statement before the planning commissioners
Thursday, Kaddis said that owners of nearby properties were upset
that he had purchased the $615,000 parcel off Baldwin Road. One of
them disgustedly asked him, "Where the hell are you from?" he said,
and an anonymous letter threatened that he would be harmed and his
citrus groves burned.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis raised his voice as he rejected the accusations against
him. "I am not a dog!" he said. "I am not a lawbreaker! I am a
Christian! All of a sudden when I come to Ventura County I am
suddenly a lawbreaker!"</TE>
<TE>   However, planning commissioners did not buy Kaddis' contention
that he had nothing to do with the trees that were found uprooted on
his property last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to assume a great conspiracy" among various county
departments and angry neighbors, said Commissioner Selma Dressler.
"It defies reason."</TE>
<TE>   Even if commissioners had agreed that the oaks were bulldozed by
an enemy of Kaddis, state law requires that the property owner be
liable for environmental infractions, said Michael Wesner, the
commission's chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "The landowner is held accountable regardless of who did it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis, 57, lives in Los Angeles and had searched the state for an
ideal retirement spot, according to testimony Thursday. He also had
mentioned building a church, kennel or battered women's sanctuary on
the site, according to a county report.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs displayed by planning officials Thursday showed
hillsides shorn of both oaks and native grasses. However, 20 acres of
orange trees were left intact.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddis admitted renting bulldozers, but said they were used only
to clear brush at the site. The bulldozers were vandalized before
they were returned to the rental company, but Kaddis said he didn't
know who did it. He also said his irrigation pipes had been
intentionally cut.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Evans, Kaddis' attorney, sought to have the hearing delayed
one month. In that time, he promised, he would find an arborist to
testify that the 301 uprooted oaks were killed long before Kaddis
owned the property.</TE>
<TE>   Such testimony would sharply contrast with the findings of the
tree expert hired by the county. After examining the downed trees,
Paul Rogers concluded that they had been bulldozed no earlier than
Aug. 12, 2001. Kaddis had taken possession of the land two weeks
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   But commissioners said that Kaddis could have found an expert as
long ago as last October, when he was told by the county planning
department that he had violated laws protecting oak trees. They also
rejected Evans' claim that county employees had been excessively
zealous in making their case against Kaddis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really disturbed at the personal attacks made on the planning
staff," Dressler said.</TE>

<HD>A Tale of Two Cities, One Wall</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Residents of South Pasadena applaud a decision to
keep a barrier dividing it from an L.A. neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear South Pasadena Mayor Harry A. Knapp tell it, the low walls
and landscaping that separate Via Del Rey in South Pasadena from Van
Horne Avenue in Los Angeles are nothing more than a traffic barrier.</LD>
<LD>   But to City Councilman David V. Rose, they are a powerful symbol
of how South Pasadena is perceived by the outside world. And that
perception is, often enough, that the predominantly white city is
trying to wall its mostly Latino neighbors out.</LD>
<LD>   Rose was the lone dissenter when South Pasadena City Council
members voted late Wednesday to modify but retain the barrier
blocking the two communities from each other--a solution to a problem
that many said was much ado about nothing. But the issue stirred the
passion of others, generating an overflow crowd and occasional jeers
at City Hall.</LD>
<TE>   Knapp said the suggestion that the city is racist by keeping the
27-year-old barrier in place was "a red herring." Rose agreed that
perception was wrong, but said it would not go away as long as the
barrier remains, calling it "an odious object in the eyes of the
greater community." For these comments, Rose was jeered, yelled at
and taunted with threats of a recall.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a barrier, a few hundred feet long, that prevents
traffic flow between South Pasadena to the north and the El Sereno
and Monterey Hills neighborhoods of Los Angeles to the south. Nearby
residents have called the barrier--with its low block walls at either
end and trees, hedges and a walking path in between--a mini-park,
pocket park, garden and, occasionally, an eyesore.</TE>
<TE>   In her successful 4-1 motion, Councilwoman Dorothy M. Cohen
specified that although the traffic barrier itself will remain
intact, the 2-foot high adobe walls will come down and the remaining
area will be relandscaped. "It's a psychological thing," she said of
the change.</TE>
<TE>   Knapp, who acknowledged that the Van Horne side "does have a
keep-out atmosphere" to it, said he hopes South Pasadena can work
with Los Angeles to make both sides of the barrier equally
attractive. Currently, the Los Angeles side of the barrier is
virtually barren, while trees and plants grow on the South Pasadena
side.</TE>
<TE>   The need for the Via Del Rey-Van Horne barrier has been questioned
since February, when Times columnist Al Martinez wrote a piece
attacking the wall and calling for then-Mayor Rose to "take down
those walls." Rose said that because the barrier has become a
divisive issue for South Pasadena and in the community at large, he
put the issue to a council vote, in part to silence criticism.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting drew a standing-room-only crowd of more than 100 to
the council chambers and another 200 people who watched the
proceedings on close-circuit television from an outside patio, with
many sporting stickers proclaiming "Save Our Mini-Park! No Via Del
Rey Corridor!"</TE>
<TE>   The crowd mostly cheered but occasionally booed speakers with
zest. When Azusa Mayor Cristina Cruz-Madrid--admonishing the audience
that the barrier "is not viewed as a traffic issue by the rest of the
world"--spoke for more than her allotted three minutes, audience
members shouted her down and Councilwoman Cohen cut her off
mid-sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "You are taking advantage of our good manners," Cohen told
Cruz-Madrid, a former El Sereno resident. "Good night." The crowd
responded with applause and a few sharp whistles for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   Some speakers praised South Pasadena's openness and diversity.
Others condemned Martinez and Los Angeles City Councilman Nick
Pacheco, who supports opening the barrier.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the speakers cited traffic when arguing to retain the
barrier between the "Altos" community of South Pasadena, a planned
development built in the 1950s and '60s, and Van Horne, which was
widened by the city of Los Angeles in the late '60s and subsequently
became a major thoroughfare.</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime residents of the area recall the first time the
street closure was debated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was here 28 years ago talking about the same thing," Edna Ponce
complained, drawing laughs from the audience. She supports the
barrier and says that, even then, the public debate over the wall
seemed unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Others worried about the safety of children attending Monterey
Hills Elementary School, about half a mile north of the barrier, if
the street were opened to more traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Abelardo de la Pena Jr., a South Pasadena resident, was one of
only three speakers who opposed the wall. "I see the wall and all
that it represents as a symbol of divided communities," he said. "I
support the removal of the wall and the joining of two communities."</TE>
<TE>   But Angela Diaz, who grew up in El Sereno and now lives in South
Pasadena, was not convinced that tearing down the wall would help
either neighborhood, citing higher crime rates on the other side of
the barrier. "I think the people of El Sereno should pay attention to
their own community," she said "We'll pay attention to ours."</TE>
<TE>   The long evening ended the same way it began: with a discussion by
Knapp about how the city must work to improve how people perceive it.
After about two hours of discussion, the council took a swift
roll-call vote and Knapp slammed down his gavel at 10:10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was surprised by the outcome of the vote, Rose said,
"I had sort of an idea" of how it would go. "But as long as the road
is closed to through traffic," he said, "the perception will remain.
Whether there's a 2-foot wall, or no wall, or something 60 feet
long."</TE>

<HD>Not Even the Pope Can End the Sex Abuse Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW M. GREELEY</AU>
<BD>Father Andrew M. Greeley, a priest and sociologist in
Chicago, is the author, most recently, of "Irish Stew!" (Tor Books,
2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Pope John Paul II assembles the American cardinals in Rome, cries
are heard around the land for the Catholic Church to recover its
credibility as a moral teacher in the wake of the sex abuse scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the church in its present form cannot. Still, it is
clear from surveys that Catholics are not leaving the church, that
those who plan to cut their contributions are those who go to church
rarely and don't contribute much, and that in general Catholics trust
their priests and approve of their pastors.</LD>
<LD>   They have, however, lost confidence in their bishops. When this
media feeding frenzy finally ends, will much have changed? A harmless
and mostly irrelevant statement will emerge from Rome. Most bishops
no longer will reassign sex abusers, though some might, confident
that they can get away with it.</LD>
<TE>   At their own meeting in Dallas in June, the bishops probably will
issue a number of statements expressing sorrow and promising that it
won't happen again. The Vatican will continue to express "sadness."</TE>
<TE>   Such pro forma statements are not likely to satisfy the four out
of five Catholics who are disturbed by the bishops' handling of child
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The credibility of the leadership of the Catholic Church will
continue to be weak. No bishop is likely to lose his job. After all,
as Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law has argued in self-defense, his big
mistake was not to keep better records.</TE>
<TE>   Hilaire Belloc, the English Catholic writer of the first half of
the last century, once remarked that an institution that can survive
such knavish imbecility must have special protection from God.</TE>
<TE>   There are a number of reasons why the U.S. bishops are incapable
of responding effectively. They are a collegium in which no one has
central authority, either by canon law as do the "primates" in
countries such as Ireland and Poland or by experience and force of
character. So any statements they might make will necessarily be
pegged at the lowest common denominator of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, for many of them credibility is not a problem. No matter
what the media say, they still are bishops, they still have power and
authority, they still are accountable only to God and to Rome and not
to their people, much less to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, many of them are not really prepared to admit even to
themselves that they are guilty of great moral evil. They have
cooperated in the rape of the innocent, yet they have a wide variety
of excuses for what happened and people to blame--the media, the
victims, the lawyers. Perhaps they even believe that Jesus, who loved
little children, will accept their excuses. There is no one in their
inner circles to say bluntly to them, "You have sinned and you must
do penance." Bishops don't do penance. Rather, they rally 'round and
denounce abortion, as though they are without sin.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican will continue to fall back, as clerics of all
denominations are inclined to do, on stereotypes and cliches:
Americans are a sex-crazed people, it's all about money and
(naturally) the media created the problem.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to deploy those stereotypes because the inhabitants of
the Vatican, like most Europeans, are anti-American. One almost can
hear them saying, "America is not our most serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   Thus the church, nationally and internationally, is organized in
such a way that it cannot respond to the abuse problem in ways that
its American members want it to. Unless the meeting of cardinals in
Rome is far more successful than there is any good reason to expect,
there will be no endgame for this most recent wave of scandals. The
crisis will not conclude, it will not end. It will simply stop--when
the media find another target.</TE>

<HD>Standing Alone With Our Views on Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIBLEY TELHAMI</AU>
<BD>Shibley Telhami, a professor of government and politics
at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, is co-editor of "Identity and Foreign Policy in the
Middle East" (Cornell University Press, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has been waging the global war on terrorism
as if terrorism is a movement, an ideology, a political coalition,
with little differentiation from case to case. This has distorted our
moral view of the world and enabled even Slobodan Milosevic to
justify his horrific policies of death and ethnic cleansing.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorism is an instrument, not a movement. It is an immoral means
employed by groups, some of which have just causes, some of which
don't.</LD>
<LD>   To reduce its occurrence, it must be internationally delegitimized
and the conditions under which it thrives minimized.</LD>
<TE>   By definition, legitimacy and illegitimacy cannot be unilaterally
decided; when the U.S. goes against the rest of the world, it is U.S.
actions that appear illegitimate.</TE>
<TE>   The world supported the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks
not because of how we defined the global war on terrorism, but
despite it.</TE>
<TE>   We were attacked in the cruelest way by a group that only employs
terrorism and whose aim is nothing short of our pain and destruction.
There was no possible compromise or political solution. We were
neither in conflict with Afghanistan nor did we occupy its
territories.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism aside, our cause was undeniably just. And even as we may
have been able to go it alone, we still made sure we received
international support at the United Nations and the support of dozens
of coalition partners. Our actions were legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   But now, there is a creeping and unfortunate tendency in our
debates to compare Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's actions
against the Palestinians to the U.S. war in Afghanistan. There is a
reason why we stand alone around the world in making this comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The only thread linking the two cases is that terrorism is
unfortunately and unacceptably used by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   We must continue to reject terrorist means, especially suicide
bombings, but we cannot allow this issue to distort our view of
reality.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians and Israelis are parties in conflict. Both have
legitimate aims: Israel, peace and security; the Palestinians,
freedom from occupation. Unfortunately, both continue to employ
immoral and illegitimate means: The Palestinians employ terrorism,
and Israel employs collective punishment against civilians and takes
land from Palestinians to build Israeli settlements.</TE>
<TE>   It's a conflict that can be resolved only politically, and that is
consequential for regional and global stability.</TE>
<TE>   Even if we sympathize with Israel's security aims, our inability
to see the illegitimacy of the scope and scale of Sharon's actions in
the West Bank undermines the international legitimacy that's
essential for the success of the global struggle against terrorist
means. And our narrow focus on the means alone is blinding us to the
potential consequences of escalation that the rest of the world
deeply fears.</TE>
<TE>   The "go it alone" view that informs the Washington debate today is
a dangerous illusion. We have traveled from the most pervasive sense
of weakness and vulnerability in American history last September to
the most strident sense of self-confidence that followed our early
success in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Neither mood reflects reality, which is that the United States is
very powerful today but not powerful enough to confront the global
threats alone. And because legitimacy in the end is about consensus,
we certainly cannot unilaterally determine what is internationally
legitimate.</TE>

<HD>The U.S. Isn't Wedded to Saudi Oil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY A. WEISS</AU>
<BD>Stanley A. Weiss is founder and chairman of Business
Executives for National Security, a nonpartisan organization of
business leaders based in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next week's emergency summit between President Bush and Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah aims to heal recently inflicted wounds to the
long-standing U.S.-Saudi partnership. But like all marriages of
convenience, the loveless union between the United States and Saudi
Arabia always has been based more on common interests (oil) than
common values (freedom).</LD>
<LD>   And Sept. 11 exposed the depths of this dysfunctional
relationship. Saudi Arabia, Americans were shocked to learn, was
cheating all along and, worse, funding its infidelities with U.S.
dollars. As gas-guzzling Americans pumped more money than any other
nation into the oil kingdom, the royal family was pumping millions
into radical religious schools at home and abroad, globalizing their
strict 18th century Wahhabi brand of Islam. From these hotbeds of
hate graduated Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   Paradoxically, the U.S. forces deployed 12 years ago to protect
and stabilize Islam's Holy Land have achieved just the opposite,
undermining public support for the very regime they were sent to
protect and inspiring Bin Laden's jihad against America.</LD>
<TE>   As Abdullah wrote to Bush last summer, "a time comes when peoples
and nations part ... it is time for the United States and Saudi
Arabia to look at their separate interests."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Saudis say the U.S. needs them. But truth be told, the
United States today is less, not more, dependent on Saudi oil. The
country that provides the U.S. with more oil than any other (40% of
the crude we use) is--the U.S. The United States also imports twice
as much oil from its Western Hemisphere neighbors, including Canada
and Venezuela, as it does from the Persian Gulf. The U.S. needs oil,
but not from Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Russia edged out Saudi Arabia to become the world's
biggest producer of crude for the first time since the 1980s. The
largest oil field in 30 years was discovered off the coast of
Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic. Some analysts are calling that
a "second Kuwait." The Caspian Basin is believed to hold the world's
third-largest reserves (perhaps up to 200 billion barrels), behind
only the Persian Gulf and Siberia. South America and western Africa
together are believed to hold an additional 100 billion barrels.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, with one-quarter of the world's oil reserves and an
excess capacity of 3 million barrels a day, only Saudi Arabia can
moderate the markets with a turn of the spigot, as it did following
Iraq's recent decision to suspend exports for up to 30 days.
Nevertheless, the Saudis need the U.S. as much as the other way
around.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, oil is the only game, accounting for more than
90% of exports and 80% of government revenue. As oil prices have
plunged in recent years, the national debt has soared. Per capita
gross domestic product has plummeted from $28,000 in 1981 to less
than $7,000 today. With dwindling receipts, the House of Saud simply
cannot afford the generous welfare state with which it bought the
loyalty of its people.</TE>
<TE>   This is why the oiligarchies of the Gulf are not responding to
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's call to withhold oil as a weapon
against the United States and Israel. If they don't sell it, others
will. These petro-princes remember that their boldest attempt at
using oil as a weapon, the embargo of the 1970s, failed in its main
mission of forcing Israel from the Palestinian territories. Even
today, half or more of Iraqi oil ends up in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries the
superpower it was two decades ago. Witness the cartel's pathetic
attempt at cajoling Russia, not an OPEC member, into significant
production cuts to prop up prices.</TE>
<TE>   Americans worried about rising oil prices need not fear a Saudi
Arabia scorned. It's time for the U.S. to walk out on Saudi oil.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Any comedian can wring out empathetic laughs with an HMO horror
story. Any politician can bring a tear with tales of managed-care
mismanagement. It's hard to resist wanting to punish HMOs, to try to
force them to give better care. That doesn't mean it's the right
thing to do, since one of the aims of managed care has always been to
dampen spiraling medical costs.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the raft of health coverage bills--18 of them--now
pending in the California Legislature. Some of the proposals are
being peddled by lobbyists. One, mandating coverage of hearing aids,
comes from a group funded in part by hearing aid manufacturers. Other
bills come from legislators who may simply be trying to ensure that
all Californians get medically necessary care.</LD>
<LD>   None of the bills, however, have been subjected to any serious
scrutiny of cost, in a state where employers are already reeling from
record health insurance premium increases and whose government is
facing a deficit of $8 billion to $12 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The Legislature has already seen the problem with the welter of
costly bills, which would among other things remove cost caps on
infertility treatments, require coverage of acupuncture and deny
doctors the right to withhold futile or ineffective treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Health Committee Chairwoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) has
suggested that legislators put the bills on hold and form a state
health-cost commission. It would be modeled after a successful
commission in Pennsylvania, which conducts a cost-benefit analysis on
proposed health coverage mandates. The Pennsylvania group includes
consumer advocates, medical professionals and labor and business
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   The measures before the Legislature would not directly burden the
state, but they would drive up the already soaring health insurance
costs paid by CalPERS, the pension group that buys health insurance
coverage for state workers. CalPERS announced this week that it would
increase health-care premiums by a whopping 25% next year, with no
relief in sight. And that's without the proposed mandates. In the
private sector, higher premium costs may lead some employers to drop
insurance and throw more people into government programs and
government-subsidized emergency care.</TE>
<TE>   Consider, for example, the costs of AB 1826, a bill by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) to require health plans
to provide infertility coverage ''without lifetime caps or other
restrictions.'' In vitro fertilization costs about $8,000 a cycle.
There are better and milder proposals in the batch of 18, but they
need sorting out before they come to another vote.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators, by deciding which treatments
Medicaid and Medicare will cover, play a vital role in ensuring that
patients get essential care. This editorial page has urged Washington
to let state regulators, not managed-care plans, administer Congress'
proposed drug benefit. That doesn't mean that government, especially
state legislators, should regulate one treatment at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the bills now pending in Sacramento cross a line, going
beyond legitimate oversight and into political micromanagement.
That's a bad prescription for any state.</TE>

<LD>Before leaving for the Middle East last week, Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell set limited goals: reducing the violence and starting
a dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians. He got far
less. Without help from other nations, there is probably no way to
get more.</LD>
<LD>   Powell did help bring about at least a temporary halt to rocket
attacks from Lebanon on Israel, and he promoted the notion of a
regional peace conference. He also demonstrated the Bush
administration's belated engagement in the region at a high level,
which must continue.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, the regional prognosis is as grim as at any time
since the resumption of clashes between Palestinians and Israelis 20
months ago. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon defied President
Bush's demand that he immediately withdraw troops from Palestinian
territories they had reoccupied. That undercut the credibility of
Bush and Powell and angered Arab nations, which complained that the
U.S. did not pressure Sharon enough.</LD>
<TE>   Many in the region believe that Sharon's refusal to listen to Bush
shows the Israeli leader has no interest in a political solution,
just military operations, and Washington has effectively given him a
green light. That sentiment increased due to Bush's statement
Thursday that Sharon was meeting the timetable for withdrawal from
the territories. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat issued one
denunciation of violence but spent much of his time attacking Israel
for barring him from leaving his Ramallah headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Although the United States is the main outside force in the Middle
East, other nations and regions will have to help. Egypt and Jordan,
worried about pro-Palestinian sentiment that could topple their
governments, need to apply their own pressure to Arafat and other
Palestinian leaders to end suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia should proclaim that message as well. Its crown
prince, who will meet with Bush in Texas next week, has suggested
that Arab nations normalize relations with Israel if it gives back
land it seized during the 1967 war. That could be a starting point
for a possible peace conference. The European Union has invited
Israel and Palestinians to a Madrid meeting next week; that too can
be a forum for dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's announcement that it will remain ready to blockade and
invade Palestinian territories at will is an impediment to the peace
process. So are different visions of what a Palestinian state will
look like and how much territory Israel will yield. Continued U.S.
involvement will be necessary. But diplomacy, in such a tense
environment, will not work swiftly. The Bush administration has
learned what all presidents since Harry S. Truman understood: There
is no such thing as benign neglect of the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Washington must stay involved even when the situation appears, as
now, to offer little hope of improvement.</TE>

<HD>Do Your Job, Mr. Ashcroft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judge Robert Jones did not mince words Wednesday when he ruled that
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft had no right to shut down Oregon's assisted
suicide law. The federal district judge was so outraged by the
attorney general's effort to overturn the will of Oregon voters, who
twice approved the statute, that he gave voice to what many others
had no doubt thought: Who does Ashcroft think he is?</LD>
<LD>   "To allow an attorney general--an appointed executive whose tenure
depends entirely on whatever administration occupies the White
House--to determine the legitimacy of a particular medical practice
... would be unprecedented and extraordinary," the Portland judge
wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon's assisted suicide law permits mentally competent patients
who are terminally ill to ask their doctors for lethal drugs. From
1997, when the law took effect, through 2001, some 90 patients asked
their physicians to help them die because they were racked with the
pain of end-stage cancer or unable to feed themselves or even talk
because of conditions such as Lou Gehrig's disease.</LD>
<TE>   Although the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that terminally ill
people have no constitutional right to be given help in dying, it
acknowledged that the states are engaged in an "earnest and profound"
debate on this issue. The court cited Oregon approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft, still looking for a way to cut off that debate,
declared last November that doctors who prescribed drugs to hasten
the death of terminally ill patients under Oregon's duly passed law
would be prosecuted under the federal Controlled Substances Act.
Ashcroft strongly opposes both assisted suicide and abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Jones slapped a permanent injunction on Ashcroft's directive,
allowing Oregon's law to remain in force if the attorney general
appealed. He also charged that congressional foes of assisted
suicide--after failing to win support for a federal ban--had gone
through the back door, "seeking refuge" with Ashcroft, whose
"ideology matched their views."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Jones' ruling this week sent a sharp message to Ashcroft:
You are not Congress, you are not president. The attorney general has
more than enough to do in his own job.</TE>

<LD>Re "City Council Denies Parks' Final Appeal," April 18: After begging
for his job in front of the L.A. City Council, Bernard Parks has been
terminated as the chief of police. Maybe now he knows how the
hundreds of officers felt when they were terminated or disciplined.

<TE>   Your April 18 editorial listed a series of questions to be asked
of all potential candidates for police chief and were of the usual
politically correct variety. Perhaps the most important question,
which you failed to include, should be, "Will your first priority be
to make the streets of the city safer for law-abiding citizens?"</TE>

<TE>   Mayor James Hahn has proven himself to be a perfect tool of the
police union. He first went to bat for Mitzi Grasso and her whining,
manipulative herd with regard to their prima donna work schedules and
has now capped off his obligations to the union by undermining Chief
Parks' bid for reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Parks is a reform chief who inherited a moribund department.
Change is always going to ruffle the feathers of union brass who
strive for mediocrity, believing that seniority is the crown jewel of
human achievement, and who mislabel honest efforts to enforce minimum
standards with appropriate disciplinary procedures as a "morale
problem." During Parks' term the department began to become
disciplined again and to experience real leadership. However, Grasso
and her pawn Hahn have utilized petty politics to snuff out any real
hope of continued improvement.</TE>

<TE>   There is no doubt in my mind that Hahn was less than honest to the
African American community, which helped elect him to office. There
are four registered voters in my home. We will not be reelecting Hahn
for that very reason.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the fact that Hahn's behavior toward Parks has been
less than friendly, Parks needs to stop whining. Parks is the reason
for Chief Willie Williams' early "retirement." Parks got the job of
chief because former Mayor Richard Riordan preferred him to Mark
Kroeker. It's obvious Hahn prefers someone else for the job. Parks
needs to get over it. Williams did.</TE>

<TE>   Re "It Takes a Chief," Opinion, April 14: At last, Joe Domanick
said what really needed to be said, far more than essays on the
short-term significance of Parks' abilities, accomplishments or race:
"A chief needs to be selected directly by the mayor and serve at the
mayor's pleasure." The time is long past when L.A.'s chief of police
had to be insulated from politics and corruption, as in the earlier
part of the previous century.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than this needless, divisive, once-every-five-years
struggle to keep L.A. from sliding backward, amending the City
Charter will guarantee that we can expend our emotional capital on
things that may move us forward--such as synchronizing the bloody
traffic signals.</TE>

<LD>Poor, helpless U.S. Poor, helpless Colin Powell. Poor, helpless

the invasion (but doesn't spell out why, at least to the
public--about the mass suffering of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians). Now, more than a week later, Sharon says he'll get out
of Nablus and Jenin in about a week (but forget Bethlehem and
Ramallah).</LD>
<LD>   I've been around and informed for the last 30 years that we've
been financing Israel's tanks, F-16s, helicopter gunships, etc., with
$3 billion a year and, frankly, I'm sick of hearing my "leaders"
claim that we have no power to stop this human catastrophe. In fact,
we are partners in it.</LD>
<LD>   Someday, present-day members of Congress and executive branch
leaders will be rated by objective historians (and unfortunately, and
incorrectly, a lot of us who have been unable to change things) as
absolute phonies or worse.</LD>

<TE>   For years this nation has been saying that you can't make deals

<TE>   The question should not be what happened at the Jenin refugee camp
but rather why is there a Jenin refugee camp at all? Jenin is in Area
A of the Oslo accords, and therefore has been under the total control
of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Arafat has received
hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community to
better the lives of Palestinians. Where did the money go? Why wasn't
it spent to build better homes and infrastructure and to better the
lives of the Jenin camp's residents?</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that not only is Arafat a terrorist but he's a thief
as well, stealing money meant for his own people and funneling it to
his corrupt Palestinian Authority. If Arafat truly had his people's
best interests at heart rather than his own, he, and not Sharon,
would have leveled Jenin's refugee camp long ago and put decent
housing in its place.</TE>

<TE>   No one knows about the difference between the U.S. and Israel
better than those demonstrators. Ask anyone on the street which
country has his primary loyalty and he'll likely say it's America.
Ask someone at that rally and he'll probably tell you it's Israel.</TE>

peoples continue to drag them into the dark spiral of violence.</TE>
<TE>   It is abundantly clear that war is not the answer. Indeed, war
itself is the problem and the true enemy of us all. Peace has to
prevail. The alternative to peace is no alternative at all.</TE>

<LD>The answers to the questions raised in the April 15 editorial
"Misspent Alaska Crusade" are found on the front page of the same
newspaper. "Alaskans Pin Hopes on Drilling in Refuge" states that
Alaskans have no state income tax but every man, woman and child
received $1,850.28 from the state last October. Prudhoe Bay is
sending less oil each year and may soon run dry. From the Alaskan
perspective the best solution is to drill more wells; better to

<TE>   I have been exploring for oil on the North Slope of Alaska since
1949. There is a great deal of wildlife over the entire North Slope,
not just in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I am willing to
wager there is far more wildlife outside of the refuge than there is
inside. No one can keep the wildlife within the refuge, as it wanders
all over the North Slope.</TE>
<TE>   I have watched caribou take almost a week to migrate in, around
and through our seismic exploration camp near the Colville River,
north of the Brooks Range Mountains. One cannot keep the caribou
within ANWR and try to protect them in this ridiculous way.</TE>

<TE>   Words deceive. To produce our own oil to achieve energy
independence sounds good. But oil is not produced, it is extracted.
Extracted and eventually depleted. So how does this sound: "Achieve
energy independence by depleting our own reserves"? Somehow I don't
think it would fly.</TE>
<TE>   And yet it is a far more truthful version of the proposal than any
talk of production and shows the proposal for the fallacy that it is.
Actually, we should use every drop of foreign oil we can and save our
own for when we really need it (and when it costs 10 times as much as
it does now).</TE>
<TE>   Even better, why not save all oil for its irreplaceable role in
the manufacturing of plastics and lubricants and work day and night
to get our energy from alcohol, hydrogen, wind, solar and other
renewables?</TE>

<LD>"The Message in Voicemail" (editorial, April 14) clearly describes
the love-hate relationship most of us have with voicemail systems. It
is unfortunate that the extraordinary technology Gordon Matthews
created has become the subject of public ridicule. It's not the
technology itself that causes people to consistently describe
voicemail with the same negative adjectives you so appropriately
used. The problem inevitably is with its implementation, which seldom
is undertaken with the callers' needs in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Navigating a voicemail system doesn't have to be frustrating.
Unfortunately, the folks who program the systems and develop the
messages we hear tend to be obsessed with how the technology
functions rather than how effectively it communicates with customers.
Finding ways to bring humanity, caring and joy to the voicemail
experience would be a wonderful tribute to Matthews and his
invaluable contribution to business communication.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mexico Offers New IDs in U.S.," April 17: Let me get this
straight. Anaheim police started accepting a Mexican identity card
"after many undocumented people were deported . . . when they
couldn't show valid identification." In other words, illegal
immigrants can avoid being legally deported if they possess a
document which proves conclusively that they are in this country
illegally. Somebody throw down a rope, because America has fallen

<HD>Rusty Burrell, 76; Bailiff in Real Life and on 'The
People's Court'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a sheriff's deputy in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Rusty
Burrell served as bailiff during the trials of Caryl Chessman,
Charles Manson, Patty Hearst and other high-profile cases.</LD>
<LD>   But for millions of Americans, Burrell was best known as the
affable, silver-haired bailiff in the courtroom of Judge Joseph
Wapner on TV's "The People's Court."</LD>
<LD>   Burrell died Monday of lung cancer at his home in Rosemead. He was
76.</LD>
<TE>   Burrell spent 25 of his 31 years with the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department as a bailiff in the court system, including
working in Wapner's Los Angeles Superior Court courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell had just retired in 1981 when he was asked to serve as
bailiff on the "The People's Court." The syndicated series featured
real plaintiffs and defendants who had taken their grievances to
small claims courts in Los Angeles and then agreed to have their
cases heard by the retired Judge Wapner for a swift disposition of
their claims on national TV.</TE>
<TE>   The series ran until 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Burrell returned to a TV courtroom to serve as bailiff on
"Judge Wapner's Animal Court" on cable's Animal Planet network.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the producer I wouldn't do it without him," Wapner said at
the time. "He's the salt of the Earth. He knows how to deal with
people, and he has such a great sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Metropolis, Ill., Burrell lied about his age and
enlisted in the Navy at the start of World War II. After his
discharge, he played baseball for a couple of years as a pitcher and
outfielder in the St. Louis Browns' farm system.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out [to Los Angeles] to play ball and stayed," said
Burrell's son, Larry, adding that one of his father's friends, a
former police officer working as a store security guard in Pomona,
suggested that he join the department.</TE>
<TE>   After a short time with the Pomona Police Department, Burrell
switched to the Sheriff's Department in 1950 for the higher pay: $290
instead of $200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Burrell once said he became a bailiff because Superior Court Judge
Elmer "Larry" Doyle liked his sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "I was visiting a friend of mine who was working in Judge Doyle's
courtroom," he recalled. "The judge loved to play practical jokes on
people. When I laughed at one he pulled on me, he asked me if I would
like to become his bailiff."</TE>
<TE>   When Burrell began appearing on "The People's Court," he was no
stranger to television.</TE>
<TE>   He already had served as the original bailiff on the syndicated
television series "Divorce Court" in the 1950s. The show featured a
real attorney playing the judge and real lawyers but used actors as
litigants.</TE>
<TE>   The show's producers had been talking to Burrell about being an
advisor on the show.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good looking guy, and they just decided to put him on
the show," said Larry Burrell. "My dad was in charge of getting the
attorneys to be on the show."</TE>
<TE>   One of the attorneys who appeared frequently on the show was Judge
Wapner's father.</TE>
<TE>   During his years with the Sheriff's Department, Burrell also
moonlighted as a bit actor in a number of television shows such as
"General Hospital" and movies, including "Take Her, She's Mine,"
starring James Stewart, and "Fate Is the Hunter," starring Glenn
Ford.</TE>
<TE>   He also appeared in numerous TV commercials and was, Larry Burrell
said, "Col. Morton on packages of Morton's Frozen Foods."</TE>
<TE>   While working as a bailiff, Burrell accompanied Chessman,
the-so-called "Red Light Bandit" and serial rapist who was executed
in 1960, to the law library every day. And during the Manson trial,
Burrell guarded the notorious cult leader, recalling, "that was me
sitting right beside him all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to tell me, 'Rusty, why don't you let me go?' And I'd
say, 'Charlie, you know I can't do that.' And he said, 'You know, I
could get up and walk out of here any time I want.' And I said,
'Charlie, you won't even get to the door.'"</TE>
<TE>   Larry Burrell said his father enjoyed appearing on television,
"but it wasn't his big thing. He was never a Hollywood guy. In all
honesty, he did it more just to support his family."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Burrell is survived by his wife, Clara;
son Mark of Anaheim Hills; five grandchildren; one great-grandchild;
and a sister, Faith Martin.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 9 a.m. today at Rose Hills
Memorial Park in Whittier. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that
contributions be made to an Alzheimer's group of choice.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was placed on administrative
leave Thursday, one day after prosecutors charged him and his wife, a
former school principal, with a felony for allegedly abusing their
teenage son.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Grady Machnick and his wife, Deborah, pleaded not guilty
Thursday in Orange County Superior Court to conspiracy to commit
child endangerment. They are accused of physically and emotionally
abusing the boy at their home in Yorba Linda.</LD>
<LD>   The sergeant, a 22-year department veteran, allegedly punched his
son and forced him to sleep outside on several occasions. The boy's
stepmother, former principal of a Walnut school, is accused in court
papers of taking nude photos of the boy while laughing at him.</LD>
<TE>   Grady Machnick will continue to receive his $87,000 annual salary
while on leave, said Sheriff's Deputy Richard Westin, a department
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The father's attorney, John Barnett, said the parents broke no
laws while disciplining their son.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Walnut Valley Unified School District transferred
Deborah Machnick from her post at Cyrus J. Morris Elementary School
after the allegations surfaced last year. Serving in an
administrative post in which she has no contact with children, she is
currently helping the district develop teaching strategies, said
Michael Armijo, a district spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, 15, is living with an Orange County foster family.</TE>

<HD>Le Cao Dai, 74; Top Vietnamese Expert on Agent Orange's
Effects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Le Cao Dai, Vietnam's leading expert on the damaging effects of the
defoliant Agent Orange, which the U.S. used to clear jungle cover
during the Vietnam War, died Monday in Hanoi. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Dai had been hospitalized for acute pancreatitis for two weeks
before his death.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty years ago, Dai was a North Vietnamese army surgeon treating
wounded soldiers in the South Vietnam jungle near Pleiku when a thick
fog drifted down from a plane. Within days, the dense vegetation
around the army hospital began to yellow and die.</LD>
<TE>   The cause was Agent Orange, vast quantities of which the U.S.
sprayed over swaths of what was then South Vietnam. Its chief
ingredient was dioxin, one of the deadliest toxins created by man and
known for its persistence as an environmental contaminant.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 19 million gallons of herbicides the U.S. sprayed over
South Vietnam between 1962 and 1971, about 55% was Agent Orange.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was some kind of chemical, but I didn't know what," Dai
told People Weekly magazine a few years ago, recalling the first time
he witnessed the release of the defoliant. "What we didn't know then
was that Agent Orange would go on killing people and causing many
kinds of illnesses and disorders in their children."</TE>
<TE>   Dai carried out some of the earliest studies in Vietnam showing
Agent Orange's toll. He went on to direct the Agent Orange Victims
Fund of the Vietnam Red Cross, which raises money to care for roughly
1 million people believed to be suffering from dioxin poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   He also was outspoken in his call for the U.S. to help clean up
the problems associated with dioxin contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the Albert Einstein of Agent Orange and dioxin research,"
said Dr. Arnold Schecter of the University of Texas School of Public
Health in Dallas, who collaborated with Dai on several studies. "He
had a wonderful gift for knowing where to look, where to sample
people. And he had a historic knowledge of the actual spraying of
Agent Orange. A major Vietnamese scientist is gone ... the most
knowledgeable by far" on Agent Orange and its legacy.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Dai and Schecter began to jointly investigate
the consequences of Agent Orange use. They gathered soil and
river-bottom samples, and examined former North Vietnamese soldiers
and their children to determine the human price of exposure to
dioxin.</TE>
<TE>   Based on their findings, the Vietnamese government estimated that
the use of Agent Orange killed or maimed 400,000 Vietnamese. The
survey concluded that another 500,000 children suffered defects such
as retardation and spina bifida.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that of the offspring of North Vietnamese
soldiers who fought in the south and were exposed to Agent Orange, 5%
were born with defects, compared with only 1% of the children of
those who fought in the north.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam cares for several hundred of the children believed damaged
by their fathers' Agent Orange exposure in eight "peace villages,"
mainly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.</TE>
<TE>   Dai often urged the U.S. government to help clean up the areas
polluted by dioxin. He and other researchers have identified as many
as 50 dioxin "hot spots" in southern Vietnam, mostly around former
U.S. air bases.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he and Schecter announced the results of a study that
showed extremely high levels of dioxin in the blood of people living
near the former U.S. base at Bien Hoa, near Ho Chi Minh City.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about guilt here," Dai said a few years ago.
"But I believe the U.S. has a moral responsibility to help us clean
up contaminated areas."</TE>
<TE>   According to Schecter, Dai was frustrated by what he felt was an
inadequate response to the problems of dioxin contamination not only
from the U.S., but also from his own government, which worried that
too much publicity about dioxin levels would hurt the country's
agricultural exports.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot forget the people who are suffering just to make
profits in trade," Dai said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Dai served as an army surgeon from 1966 to 1974 in a North
Vietnamese Army field hospital near Pleiku in the Central Highlands.
He retired as a colonel in 1984 because of an eye condition that left
him nearly blind.</TE>
<TE>   Dai said he had experienced a mild exposure to Agent Orange during
the war, but no dioxin was ever found in his blood. He attributed his
luck in this regard to his distaste for fish, which he believed to be
a major source of dioxin poisoning in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Although still suffering the ill effects of a serious stroke last
year, Dai participated in March in an unusual joint conference on
Agent Orange in Hanoi that brought together environmental officials
and scientists from the U.S. and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting produced an agreement to set priorities for research
on cleanup efforts, as well as on possible links between dioxin
poisoning and a host of health problems from miscarriage to cancer.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a wife, a daughter and sisters.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Presents El Toro Plan to Navy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials presented their plan for developing the El Toro
Marine base as a park and university to Navy representatives
Thursday, but walked away with only a renewed pledge from Washington
that the base's fate would be announced next week.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the session left park backers upbeat. "It was a very
productive meeting and the Navy will let us know on Tuesday," said
Irvine Councilman Mike Ward, who was briefed on the meeting by City
Manager Allison Hart.</LD>
<LD>   In the March 5 election, Orange County voters killed county
government's plan to build an airport at El Toro by rezoning the base
for a park, a nature preserve and limited development.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine wants the Navy to give it about 3,600 acres of the base,
with the military sharing in proceeds from the sale of 1,500 homes to
be built on 440 acres along the base's southern edge.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials gave the impression that they will dispose of the
4,700-acre base and work with Irvine on how to do that, said Paul
Eckles, executive director of the nine-city, anti-airport El Toro
Reuse Planning Authority. Whether they give land to Irvine in
exchange for development money or arrange some other type of sale
hasn't been determined, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all up for negotiation, but they're willing to work out the
details with the city of Irvine," Eckles said. "Certainly money is an
issue, and there are a lot of procedural issues to be worked out. But
our people went out of the meeting very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials said they won't comment on the site's future before
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's proposal calls for the land to be used for a southern
campus for Cal State Fullerton, a campus research park and faculty
housing shared with UC Irvine, and an expansion of the Orange County
Fair and Exposition Center.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 acres of the base already has been set aside by the
federal government as a wildlife sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Others attending Thursday's meeting were Irvine Councilman Chris
Mears, Irvine planner Dan Jung, Lake Forest Mayor Richard T. Dixon
and Councilman Peter Herzog, and Laguna Hills Councilman L. Allan
Songstad Jr., representing the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, a contingent of elected leaders from Southern
California asked Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Jane
Garvey and Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta to urge the
Navy to postpone its El Toro decision and preserve the option for an
airport there.</TE>
<TE>   An FAA spokesman said Thursday that the agency would not pressure
the Navy to delay.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to do anything to prevent the decisions made by
the people of Orange County from going forward," said Los
Angeles-based FAA spokesman Jerry Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   "Our input has had to do with the impact of having an airport
there, not whether the property would be used for an airport. That's
not our decision."</TE>

<HD>A 'Green' Building Grows on a UC Campus</HD>
<DH>Education: Recyclables shape environmentally friendly Bren
school. From waterless urinals to skylights, the project could be a
'bellwether.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>SANTA BARBARA -- The University of California here is about to strike
the next blow in the nation's "greener than thou" competition to
build the most environmentally friendly building.</LD>
<LD>   When the 85,000-square-foot Donald Bren Hall formally opens today,
it will employ some of the most leading-edge construction and design
techniques, from furnishings made of old Buicks to waterless urinals
and restroom stalls made from plastic soda bottles.</LD>
<LD>   "Pretty much everything in the building was done with the notion
that it should be recyclable or made out of recycled material," said
Dennis Aigner, dean of the School of Environmental Science and
Management, which is in the new building.</LD>
<TE>   One thing that makes the structure stand out from other so-called
clean buildings is that it uses a wide range of technologies to
minimize the building's impact on the surrounding environment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 93% of the construction waste generated by the
building contractor was recycled.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this is the next step in commercial building
construction," said Mo Lovegreen, a spokeswoman for the university.
She predicted that it will become a "bellwether for the University of
California," setting standards against which future campus
construction will be measured.</TE>
<TE>   University officials expect it to win the platinum award from the
U.S. Green Building Council, formed in 1993 to encourage
environmentally friendly commercial construction. Lovegreen said only
one other site in the United States has achieved that standard: a
small office building in Annapolis, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours is three times as large," said Lovegreen, making it that
much more difficult to achieve significant energy and construction
efficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   The $26-million building will be formally unveiled to the public
today at a ceremony featuring state and local dignitaries, from UC
Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry Yang and Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa
Barbara) to Winston Hickox, secretary of the state Environmental
Protection Agency. "Kermit the Frog," the famed Jim Henson Muppet,
will be an emcee.</TE>
<TE>   Construction was racing toward completion earlier this month when
Aigner and Lovegreen offered a tour of the building. They said the
ambitious new approach to the project began even before the structure
started rising from the dust.</TE>
<TE>   The building sits on the site of an old parking lot. Rather than
breaking up the pavement and hauling it off to the dump, workers
ground it up and used the asphalt and concrete in the new building.
Trees were preserved, and even the small plants bordering the parking
lot were used as mulch, instead of being thrown away.</TE>
<TE>   The building contains offices, classrooms and laboratories. Only
the labs are air-conditioned, and building lights dim automatically
as the sun brightens, which is supposed to save up to 40% in energy
usage.</TE>
<TE>   On warm days, teachers will simply open the windows, as in the old
days, said Aigner. To counteract the danger of students dozing off,
the building automatically pumps more oxygen into the room when
carbon dioxide levels rise.</TE>
<TE>   "But it won't take care of boring speakers," Aigner quipped..</TE>
<TE>   The building goes easy on water consumption by installing urinals
that don't use water. A layer of oil inside the tank absorbs the
waste, expected to save 45,000 gallons of water a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most adventurous technologies were used in the
construction materials.</TE>
<TE>   In the restrooms, for instance, the countertops were decorated
with embedded broken glass. The partitions were made of plastic
bottles.</TE>
<TE>   All materials used were designed to minimize gaseous releases that
are the major cause of indoor pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Carpeting on the second floor of the four-story building was
carefully restored after being reclaimed from a Los Angeles Fortune
500 company. "We kept 14 tons of carpet out of the landfill," said
Lovegreen.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the flooring is linoleum, made of cork residue, linseed
oil and flax seeds. Beneath the linoleum, the concrete base contains
ash left over from coal-fired power plants.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lovegreen, 90% of the structural steel in the
building was shipped by an Oklahoma company that reclaimed junked
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Where wood is used, it must have been certified as coming from
sustainable-harvest forests. The cabinet doors in the labs may look
like particle board, but they are made of wheat waste. Old newspapers
went into the ceiling tiles.</TE>
<TE>   Public tours of the building will be conducted from 1 to 2 p.m.
today.</TE>

<HD>John McGuire, 85; Forest Service Chief Revised Timber Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- John McGuire, an economist who implemented
controversial lumber policy issues of the 1970s as chief of the U.S.
Forest Service, died April 6 at Asbury Methodist Village in
Gaithersburg, Md. He was 85 and had brain cancer and emphysema.</LD>
<LD>   McGuire--tall, taciturn, rarely without his pipe--was a career
Forest Service employee. Beginning in forest research, he gained a
reputation as an expert manager and took over as chief in 1972. He
retired in 1979 as protector of nearly 190 million acres of public
land.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most important issues of his day was clear-cutting. He
had to balance the needs of the lumber industry, the concerns of
environmentalists and the average citizen who might be shocked by the
aesthetic result of the cutting.</LD>
<TE>   Upon becoming chief, McGuire added guidance that affected the size
of tree-cutting on some land. His plans also considered the effects
on soil, water, fish and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   He was instrumental in formulating and implementing the Forest and
Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, a master plan to
manage the supply of and demand for resources on private and public
forest land.</TE>
<TE>   McGuire played a large role in drafting the National Forest
Management Act of 1976. The act was passed in response to a court
decision prohibiting the cutting of trees that were not mature or
"large growth," meaning big for their species. The 1976 act offered a
comprehensive management review of land supervised by the Forest
Service. It also repealed the 19th century law at the root of the
court case.</TE>
<TE>   In a contentious move in 1979, President Jimmy Carter ordered
McGuire to temporarily increase the amount of timber sold from
national forests by 1 billion board feet per year. The president sold
the decision as a way to reduce housing costs and inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in the future, we would have to cut less," McGuire
said. "Then we could go back to a sustainable yield. It's a balancing
act."</TE>
<TE>   The concerns were not always so weighty. During Christmas 1975, a
reporter noticed an artificial tree in McGuire's Agriculture
Department office. A spate of news stories followed.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, McGuire was on vacation and his secretary
thought his office needed a holiday touch. She brought the fake tree
from her home. When McGuire returned, he laughed off the situation
and proudly told his secretary that she did a nice job of managing
the press.</TE>
<TE>   John Richard McGuire was a Milwaukee native and a forestry
graduate of the University of Minnesota. He received a master's
degree in forestry from Yale University and a master's degree in
economics from the University of Pennsylvania. During World War II,
he served in the Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific theater.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and '60s, he was chief economist and then director of
the Pacific Southwest Forest and Range Experiment Station in
Berkeley. He was a prime contributor to "Timber Resources for
America's Future," an agency survey.</TE>
<TE>   He came to the Washington area in 1967 as a top assistant to his
predecessor, Edward Cliff. He received the President's Award for
Distinguished Federal Service.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Marjory Graff McGuire, whom he married
in 1945, of Gaithersburg; a daughter, Joan McGuire of Raleigh, N.C.;
a brother; and a sister.</TE>

<HD>Learning Fate of Son Is Family's Sad Quest</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A Huntington Beach athlete missed his 'ultimate
fighting' bout and hasn't been seen. Police fear the worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Large family had gathered at their Costa Mesa home on Dec. 8 to
wish son Matt good luck. After months of training, the 23-year-old
former star wrestler at Newport Harbor High School was on the eve of
his first "ultimate fighting" match.</LD>
<LD>   But Large never showed up for the family celebration. He also
missed his match.</LD>
<LD>   No one has seen or heard from him since.</LD>
<TE>   More than four months later, both his family and police are
struggling to piece together what happened, while losing hope that he
is still alive.</TE>
<TE>   Police discovered his truck submerged in Humboldt Bay near Eureka,
but found no other sign of him.</TE>
<TE>   The family hired a private investigator and checked the last calls
made on his cellular phone, but they uncovered more questions than
answers.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Kim Large, can barely stop the tears as she talks
about her son, how close they are and how his disappearance has
turned from a missing-person case into a homicide investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach homicide Det. Dave Dierking, who has worked on
the case since early January, would reveal no details but said he's
beginning to think the worst.</TE>
<TE>   "All the indicators are that he's the victim of a homicide,"
Dierking said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are leads we are working, and I'm hopeful we can ... show
what has happened to him."</TE>
<TE>   Police have talked to more than 100 people since January,
including many of Large's friends and relatives. "They were a pretty
close-knit family, and he had a good set of close friends," Dierking
said. "For him to go completely off the map...."</TE>
<TE>   The young fighter stood 5 feet 8 and weighed 130 pounds before he
began to train. But he was always strong and athletic.</TE>
<TE>   "We bowled together, we played volleyball together, we trained
together," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   After high school, Large worked for a Santa Monica fish market,
but soon was working alongside his dad as an apprentice pipe-fitter.</TE>
<TE>   He yearned for the athletic competition of his high school days
and saw ultimate fighting, a sport that mixes martial arts, wrestling
and kick-boxing, as a way of getting back to that.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Kim Large saw her son was Wednesday, Dec. 5. He was
at her house divvying up the 20 tickets he had for the ultimate
fighting competition.</TE>
<TE>   That night, good friend Emmett Olvera stopped by Large's
Huntington Beach apartment on his way to a volleyball game.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers his last words to Large: "All right, brother, I'll
see you tomorrow." But he never saw him again.</TE>
<TE>   At the Huntington Beach Training Center where he trained and where
his bout would be, manager Noel Ciambotti recalled their last
meeting: "I talked to him on Thursday in the morning. He said he was
going to come out here and train that night, and he never showed up."
That Thursday, none of the phone messages from his father, mother and
brother Nathan were returned.</TE>
<TE>   One clue his family has are the last calls from his cell phone
about 1:20 p.m. that Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The family got the record of his outgoing calls and called all the
numbers. One of the people they spoke to said Large had been on his
way to San Clemente that day and had to make a stop in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   His mother said he was in San Clemente dropping off tickets to the
fight, but she has no idea who or what was in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   There was a report that neighbors saw him that Friday at his
apartment and spoke with him for several minutes. But family members
believe the neighbors are mistaken about the date.</TE>
<TE>   The family was even more perplexed when his pickup was found
submerged outside Eureka on Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been there. We never took the kids up north," Kim
Large said.</TE>
<TE>   In the first weeks after Large disappeared, friends and family
plastered posters with his picture throughout Huntington Beach.
Fellow ultimate fight competitors handed out fliers at stores and
parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I put posters on my truck ... passed out a big stack to all my
friends," Ciambotti said.</TE>
<TE>   But no new leads developed, and all the posters eventually came
down from the training center.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Large tries to remain optimistic. "I still hope," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends, however, are losing hope.</TE>
<TE>   Large and Olvera trained for months together for their first
ultimate fights.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems everyone is looking at me for answers because I was so
close to him," Olvera said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had answers for them. I wish I had closure, but I have
nothing."</TE>

<LD>James Allan Hendrix, 82, father of '60s electric guitar legend Jimi
Hendrix, died of congestive heart failure Wednesday in Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Hendrix, a former plumber, electrician and gardener, was chairman
of Experience Hendrix, a family company dealing with his rock icon
son's musical legacy and headed by his daughter, Janie L. Hendrix.</LD>
<LD>   Jimi Hendrix, who taught himself to play an old ukulele that his
father gave him before moving on to the guitar, died of a drug
overdose in 1970.</LD>
<TE>   In 1993, the elder Hendrix filed a multimillion-dollar fraud
lawsuit against his former attorney and several corporations in an
effort to recover the rights to his son's music. A settlement was
reached two years later that returned the rights to Jimi Hendrix's
music and image to his father, the sole heir to his estate.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of four children whose parents were vaudevillians,
the elder Hendrix grew up mostly in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   When his father died in the mid-1930s, he dropped out of school to
go to work. He moved to Seattle around 1940 and remained there after
winning a Golden Gloves boxing tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, his memoir "My Son Jimi" was published.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Wurzburger, 82, a rabbi and philosopher who led the Rabbinical
Council of America, died Tuesday in New York City.</LD>
<LD>   Wurzburger taught philosophy at Yeshiva University for 35 years
until his retirement last month. He also was the editor of Tradition,
a quarterly Orthodox intellectual journal, from 1962 to 1988.</LD>
<LD>   He was elected spiritual leader of America's Orthodox Jews in
1976. The Rabbinical Council of America is the country's largest and
most influential Orthodox rabbinic body.</LD>
<TE>   He was the author of "Ethics of Responsibility: Pluralistic
Approaches to Covenantal Ethics," which was well-received in Jewish
and mainstream arenas when it was published in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The book explored whether Jewish law, or Halakhah, leaves room for
individuals to make decisions according to other ethical systems. He
said that while Halakhah was the highest authority, it "makes space
for the input of individuality and subjectivity on religiously
significant issues."</TE>
<TE>   The German-born Wurzburger also served as president of the
now-defunct Synagogue Council of America, a coordinating agency for
Conservative, Orthodox and Reform Jewish organizations.</TE>

<HD>EPA Settles Lawsuit Over Pesticides</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: For the first time in a decade, agency will study
effects of 18 substances on imperiled salmon and forest plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to consider for
the first time in a decade how 18 commonly used pesticides may affect
endangered salmon and woodland plants.</LD>
<LD>   Agency officials said they will conduct the review under a lawsuit
settlement being signed today with three California environmental
groups that sued over the EPA's approval of the pesticides, which are
used in fields, forests, orchards and to control weeds along highways
and irrigation canals.</LD>
<LD>   Several million pounds of pesticides are used each year on
California almonds, apples, broccoli, grapes, lemons, plums, rice,
strawberries, tomatoes and walnuts, the environmental groups said,
citing California Department of Pesticide Regulation statistics.</LD>
<TE>   The use is concentrated in the Central Valley and along much of
the coast.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA agreed to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
National Marine Fisheries Service, and to analyze the pesticides'
effect on seven salmon species and 33 endangered forest plants.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also agreed to find ways to minimize the pesticides'
effects on endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   "These species are close to extinction, and pesticides continue to
pollute their habitat, but the EPA hasn't even begun to take action,"
said Patty Clary of Californians for Alternatives to Toxics. The
group joined the Environmental Protection Information Center and
Humboldt Watershed Council in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the pesticides have been detected in waterways at levels
that may be toxic to fish, the suit contends. They are carbaryl, used
on apples, strawberries, tomatoes and lawns; chlorpyrifos, used on
almonds, apples, broccoli, walnuts and lawns; and diazinon, used on
almonds, lettuce, plums and lawns.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental groups argued that the EPA's failure to consult
with other federal agencies on the pesticides' effects violated the
federal Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement being signed today won't be final until after a
public comment period. The suit was filed in August 2000 in federal
court in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The California Farm Bureau, Alliance for Food and Farming and
California Plant Health Assn. were unfamiliar with the suit and had
no immediate comment.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Thursday that the trial of David Westerfield, accused
of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle van Dam, can be
broadcast on television but that pretrial motions will remain sealed.
The trial is set to begin May 17.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd also ruled that no cameras will
be allowed at a May 6 pretrial hearing and that during the trial
cameras will not be allowed in the hallway of the courthouse. Mudd
said he is trying to keep potential jurors from being influenced by
"a pervasive tsunami of media attention." He continued a gag order on
everyone linked to the case.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed engineer, is accused of
kidnapping Danielle from her home Feb. 1. Her body was found four
weeks later.</LD>

<LD>Some San Joaquin Valley business owners are reluctantly supporting a
proposal by state air regulators to downgrade the valley into the
federal category reserved for the country's worst smog offenders.</LD>
<LD>   The San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Coalition, which includes
agricultural, petroleum and manufacturing groups, backs the plan,
though it will probably cost the groups up to $36 million annually.</LD>
<LD>   Valley air regulators want to reclassify the problems of the
region's air basin from severe to extreme, allowing more time for the
San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to develop a plan
to fix the problem, among the nation's worst.</LD>
<TE>   Under the "severe" designation, the valley would have to meet
Environmental Protection Agency air-quality guidelines by 2005. The
"extreme" designation would give the region until 2010.</TE>

<HD>Israel Faulted for Ignoring Victims</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Army denies U.N. envoy's allegation that it failed to
mount rescue efforts in Jenin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The highest-ranking U.N. official in the Middle East harshly
condemned the Israeli government Thursday, accusing it of failing to
mount rescue efforts here that might have saved Palestinian lives.</LD>
<LD>   Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations' special envoy to the region,
said the Israelis should have immediately sent search-and-rescue teams
after their invasion of this West Bank town, which saw the
fiercestIsraeli-Palestinian fighting in decades.</LD>
<LD>   As Larsen spoke to reporters in the ruins of Jenin's former refugee
camp, he watched a man burrow through rubble with his hands to pull out
the remains of his elderly father.</LD>
<TE>   "What we are seeing here is horrifying, horrifying scenes of human
suffering," said the Norwegian diplomat. "After the military offensive in
Jenin, the government of Israel has lost all moral ground in this
conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials angrily denied the accusations, saying
search-and-rescue teams had been sent in whenever the army received
reports of trapped victims. They said one body was found.</TE>
<TE>   "These are lies. I am sorry that Mr. Larsen has let himself be misled
by this kind of propaganda," army spokesman Capt. Kfir Luzzatto said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday was the first time since the Israeli operation in Jenin began
16 days ago that U.N. officials were allowed in to assess the damage to
the camp, which was established in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   They encountered a scene of frantic despair. Hundreds of Palestinian
men, women and children, rushing to take advantage of a brief lifting of
the military curfew, streamed into the camp to gather meager possessions,
collect their dead and search for the living.</TE>
<TE>   The center of the camp that once was home to 13,000 refugees has been
destroyed. Homes and shops that lined the main square have been replaced
by looming piles of rubble, the result of Israeli bulldozers, tanks and
shelling.</TE>
<TE>   But earthmoving equipment remained in short supply. So far, a single
bulldozer owned by the Palestinian city government has served to sift
through the debris.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Palestinians on Thursday dug with their hands or scraped
at the earth with small plastic buckets. At least two bodies were found.
Both were unrecognizable.</TE>
<TE>   Samih abu Siba and his children dug into their former basement, hoping
to find the remains of his father, Mohammed Masoud abu Siba, who they
said was about 65.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Abu Siba was killed early in the fighting when he walked
onto the family's glass-walled veranda and was shot by Israeli snipers,
his son said. They tried to get help, but Abu Siba bled to death in the
family home.</TE>
<TE>   They wrapped the body in a rug, but two hours later, Israeli
bulldozers began knocking down the house, the son said. They fled,
leaving Abu Siba's body behind.</TE>
<TE>   When they returned Wednesday and again Thursday, family members found
the rug and tried to recover the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to get half of my father," said Samih abu Siba, 43. "The
other half is still in there."</TE>
<TE>   A few yards north of Abu Siba's former residence, another body lay
just inside the wall of a dangerously tottering house. Camp residents
gathered around, but nobody could identify the corpse, a tangle of flesh
and bone wrapped in a blanket.</TE>
<TE>   The number of dead and the circumstances of their deaths have become
the central controversy in the battle of Jenin. The Israeli army lost 23
soldiers, including 13 in one explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say that between 300 and 500 died during about a week of
intense fighting. So far, however, the number of Palestinian bodies
pulled from the rubble is 37.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights officials, who sneaked into the camp in recent days, said
it is still too early to tell what happened. But they urged the Israeli
government to open the area up to complete inspection.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a need to establish the facts with authority," said Peter
Bouckaert, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. "It would be
helpful if the United States took a stronger stand to demand access to
these places."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mohammed abu Gali, director of the town's general hospital, has an
office with a view of a hastily created graveyard at a construction site
behind the hospital. Medical workers have been burying bodies there
because the hospital has a spotty power supply and no reliable way to
cool its morgue.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Gali said he believes that the Israeli government is hiding some
of the dead in refrigerated trucks. He said Israeli military officials
had recently given him five bodies recovered from the camp after storing
them in this fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials could not be reached for comment late
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Gali also said 16 people were taken out of a home in the camp
Tuesday after having been trapped for several days. They could not be
located, and at least one former resident said the men were Palestinian
fighters who had since fled.</TE>
<TE>   "The death statistics will not be known for two or three months," Abu
Gali said. "All the camp is rubble."</TE>
<TE>   The search for the dead was only part of Thursday's drama. Other
refugees worked simply to regain what they lost when they fled.</TE>
<TE>   Fuad Abahreh, 12, scratched at a pile of gray rubble that dwarfed his
small frame. He was covered in filth. His hands were gray with dust. His
face was sweaty and smudged.</TE>
<TE>   He carried the family possessions he had managed to recover in a small
plastic bucket. His grandmother's identity card. An old picture. Some
legal documents.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived here," he said, pointing to the pile of stone and twisted
metal.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards away, former neighbors were pulling clothes from their
closet. They pointed to some blankets waving in the shell of a building
that belonged to them across the street. The home had apparently been
split in half during the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Rasmieh Maslimani, 70, the home's occupant, has lived through two
previous Israeli-Arab wars. But this attack was different, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never destruction like this destruction," she said. "I have
never witnessed destruction like this, not with the Jews, not with the
Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   As the reimposed curfew neared at 2 p.m., Jenin suddenly became a
ghost town. Streets crammed with people in the morning became empty.
Bustling shops shut down. Locals disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, Israeli army officials said that, in accordance with
promises made to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell during his recent
visit, they were pulling out of the refugee camp and would leave the town
Thursday night. Early today, Israel Radio reported that the withdrawal
was complete. Tanks had taken up positions on the town's outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   Israel also continued its hunt for terrorists. Israeli radio and
television reported that the army had captured Hassam Atef Ali Badran, a
top Hamas militant allegedly involved in a March 27 suicide bombing of a
Jewish Passover celebration that killed 28 people, prompting the West
Bank invasion. Thursday's operation, near the town of Nablus, left three
people dead.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip today, Israeli forces said they returned fire
against Palestinians who shot at them during a short, routine action
inside Palestinian-controlled territory near Egypt. Palestinian doctors
said two people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks also moved into the West Bank town of Kalkilya today,
then left a few hours later, Palestinian witnesses said. The military did
not comment immediately.</TE>

<HD>Firms Question Fairness of Carson Mayor's Dealings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A waste hauler and a developer seeking to do business with the city
of Carson each say the mayor referred them to his personal lawyer, who
asked for fees of $1 million or more in exchange for help delivering City
Council approval.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies said they refused and in both cases lost out to
competing firms.</LD>
<LD>   Waste Management, which was seeking a multimillion-dollar contract to
collect garbage, and Rand Pearlman Ventures, which wanted to develop a
shopping center, each said their efforts to do business with Carson met
the same response: Mayor Daryl Sweeney strongly urged them to hire his
lawyer, Robert Pryce, as a lobbyist.</LD>
<TE>   Waste Management officials said their concern about the propriety of
the deal Pryce offered prompted them to hire a former U.S. prosecutor,
Steven Madison, to advise them on the matter. When he went to Sweeney,
who also has a vote on the City Council, Madison recalled the mayor
saying: " 'You need three votes [to get a City Council majority] and if
you have to pay Mr. Pryce . . . to get those three votes, then you should
do it. . . . You should pay whatever he's asking you to pay.' "</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management declined. A competitor hired Pryce and won the
commercial carting contract in Carson, a city of 90,000 east of the
intersection of the Harbor and San Diego freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney, whose residence was searched by the FBI and the IRS on
Tuesday, declined to comment and referred questions to a lawyer he hired
this week, a distant relative named John Sweeney. He also declined to
comment and federal officials refused to say whether the raids were made
in connection with city business.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce also did not respond to repeated requests to be interviewed for
this story.</TE>
<TE>Waste Management</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Waste Management, whose company name has a historical
association with corruption, said recent efforts to burnish the company
name made them sensitive to any appearance of impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management, a national firm headquartered in Houston, and one of
its predecessors had collected trash in the city for decades, and its
contract was up this year. The company wanted to secure a renewal without
having to bid against competitors.</TE>
<TE>   John Newell, a Waste Management attorney, said that last year the
mayor suggested the company hire Pryce, a lawyer in Carson who also has
worked for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce met with Waste Management officials and asked for a $1 million
fee, Newell said. He was orally "guaranteeing us the [contract]
extension," Newell said.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of letters in March and early April, reviewed by The
Times, Pryce elaborated. He asked Waste Management for $300,000 right
away and another $300,000 "upon the City of Carson's approval of your
hauling contract for residential and commercial hauling."</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management replied that it did not pay success-based fees and
retained lawyers only on an hourly basis. Pryce changed his proposal. He
specifically said in another letter that he was not guaranteeing success.
He requested $660,000 as a "retainer" and drafted an agreement for an
additional $297,000 if Waste Management's long-term residential and
commercial carting contract was renewed and the city resolved an
unrelated financial dispute with the waste hauler.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management sought guidance from Madison, a lawyer in private
practice who, as a former assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, had
helped successfully prosecute Walter R. Tucker III, a former Compton
mayor and member of Congress, for extorting bribes in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Madison said he concluded that Pryce was making "a very crude, odd
solicitation . . . A reasonable observer [could] conclude that . . .
either Pryce himself was promising to deliver something that couldn't
properly be promised or that Pryce was trading on his relationship with
the mayor or council members in a way that wouldn't be appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA law professor Daniel Lowenstein, principal author of California's
quarter-century-old Political Reform Act, said Pryce's alleged statements
are subject to wide interpretation. He said California law has long
barred lobbyists from accepting payments contingent on the outcome of any
proposed state legislative or administrative action; that does not apply
to municipalities.</TE>
<TE>   Madison said he arranged a meeting with the mayor and told him that
"anyone would think there is something suspicious here," expecting that
the mayor would "want to correct the record immediately."</TE>
<TE>   The former prosecutor, who is also a Pasadena City Council member,
said Sweeney told him Waste Management should pay what Pryce asked.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management did not pay, and three weeks later, on May 1, Pryce
sent another letter, withdrawing his offer to represent the company.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management officials, still eager to avoid open bidding, went
back to Sweeney and asked if he could recommend someone else to help.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney then suggested Lee Duncan, a Lynwood tree-trimmer, "as someone
who could help us with our contract," Newell said.</TE>
<TE>2 Versions of Conversations</TE>
<TE>   Newell said Duncan proposed that Waste Management pay him $40,000 per
month to trim trees interfering with garbage trucks in Carson, or $3.3
million over the seven-year life of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management, which usually contracts with tree trimmers on an
as-needed basis, figured the service was worth no more than $5,000 per
month and said it turned Duncan down.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, an African-American who describes his company, California
Western Arborists, as a small tree-trimming operation, gave a different
account of the conversations.</TE>
<TE>   He denied making the offer Newell outlined and said Waste Management
approached him, saying it wanted to include him as a minority contractor
in its trash-hauling proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan said he knows and likes Sweeney but that the mayor's name never
came up in his discussions with Waste Management.</TE>
<TE>   A letter Duncan wrote to Waste Management last October, reviewed by
The Times, touted his company and proposed a partnership. The letter does
not mention a fee.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion it would be mutually beneficial to combine our services
and play on the strengths of both companies as you attempt to secure and
extend contracts. By integrating tree trimming into your services, you
would set yourself apart from other solid waste service providers," the
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   "Marketing my landscaping company to municipalities has given me
extensive insight into the political practices and policies of several
Southern California municipalities," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   After Waste Management and Duncan failed to reach an agreement, the
city went ahead with its plan to solicit proposals from rival firms.</TE>
<TE>The Rand Development</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of this year, developer Richard Rand and his partner,
architect John Killen, were trying to negotiate exclusive rights to
develop a prime piece of land in Carson with financial help from the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Rand said they met with the Carson mayor in early January at the
offices of Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry, where Sweeney, a
part-time mayor, works full time as chief of staff. At the meeting, the
mayor told them to hire a lobbyist, Rand said. "We asked him, 'Who?' He
said, 'Well, let me make a call for you.' Right in front of us, he picked
up the phone and called Pryce," Rand said. Killen confirmed the account.</TE>
<TE>   Rand said he set up a meeting with Pryce, whose office is in downtown
Los Angeles. Pryce told him he was a close friend of Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   Records show that Pryce has also recently represented Sweeney in
litigation involving a default on a loan Sweeney guaranteed for the
purchase of a building by a fraternal organization of which he was a
member. Sweeney's wages were garnished in 1999, and last June Sweeney
agreed to pay $105,000 to the lender.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being friends with Sweeney, Pryce also told Rand and Killen
that he was close to Carson council member Raunda Frank and could deliver
Frank's vote, Rand said. Pryce picked up the phone, called Frank, and
said, "Raunda, can you meet with us?" Rand recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The next meeting took place in Pryce's law office, where Rand and
Killen said they briefed the council member on their project. After Frank
left, Rand said, Pryce made his proposal: He asked for $100,000 as a
retainer and a 10% interest in the proposed $300-million development,
which was to feature a Wal-Mart, a Sam's Club and smaller stores. Killen
said he asked Pryce to put it in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce did, in a Jan. 14 letter viewed by The Times, where he also
asked for 6% of the approximately $20 million Carson was planning to
pledge to the developers.</TE>
<TE>   "As you may recall from our conversation, I believe it essential that
you employ our law firm to assist you in being selected," the letter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rand said he then went back to Sweeney on Jan. 29 to tell him he was
uncomfortable with Pryce's proposal, but asked if there was anything else
the mayor could suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney reiterated that Rand needed a lobbyist, Rand said. "I walked
out of there feeling I'd lost the project," Rand said.</TE>
<TE>   He did.</TE>
<TE>   On March 20, Sweeney, Frank and a third member of the five-member
Carson City Council, Manuel Ontal, voted it down.</TE>
<TE>   Pilar Perry, a spokeswoman for the winning developer, Watson Land Co.,
said her firm did not hire Pryce and was not asked to.</TE>
<TE>   Frank did not return repeated calls this week.</TE>
<TE>The BFI Contract</TE>
<TE>   After Waste Management could not reach agreement with the city, Carson
solicited bids for the city's garbage collection contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Browning Ferris Industries, another giant waste hauler, hired Pryce.</TE>
<TE>   After the city received Waste Management's secret bid, Pryce faxed a
copy of it to a BFI executive, the executive later told the City Council.
"Enclosed are the various rate pricings Waste Management included in
their bid proposal to the city of Carson," said the fax on the letterhead
of Pryce's law firm. "BFI needs to at least be willing to commit to
matching these rates . . ."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Pryce was also serving as an attorney for the city in an
unrelated matter. Records show he had a contract with the city's
principal attorney to represent Carson in a lawsuit. He was fired from
that job after the leak was disclosed, a council member said.</TE>
<TE>   The fax, first reported by the Daily Breeze in Torrance, had been sent
in an apparent clerical mistake to the city maintenance yard.</TE>
<TE>   City workers notified the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The leak and the subsequent negotiations were the subject of heated
public discussion at City Council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   At a council meeting in February, Waste Management was awarded the
contract for residential pickups.</TE>
<TE>   At the same meeting, BFI was asked by a council member to lower its
bid for the more lucrative commercial carting contract. BFI agreed and
was given the contract by a 3 to 2 vote, with Sweeney, Ontal and Frank
voting for BFI and the two other council members objecting that the
process was tainted.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, FBI and IRS agents served sealed search warrants on the
residences of Sweeney and Frank, as well as the Gardena office of BFI.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's lawyer, John Sweeney, said: "Obviously, we're not going to
have him make a comment at this time. That's why he hired me," adding
that he did not yet know all the facts.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no indictment," he said. "The inference of the FBI and
the IRS serving a search warrant on his house is that they are very
serious."</TE>
<TE>Councilman Switches, Then Resigns</TE>
<TE>   At a special meeting Wednesday night, the Carson City Council
rescinded the BFI contract by a 3-2 vote. Sweeney and Frank dissented,
while Ontal switched his vote to side with the two council members who
had publicly objected when the contract was first awarded.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Ontal asked to make a statement. He said he felt he
had let residents down and that Carson deserves a decision-making process
that is "honest and fair."</TE>
<TE>   He resigned his seat, saying he hoped the move "can be another step in
the cleansing process this city so badly needs."</TE>

<HD>Thor Heyerdahl of 'Kon-Tiki' Fame Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian scientist who gained worldwide fame
more than half a century ago when he sailed a primitive balsa-log raft
called the Kon-Tiki halfway across the Pacific from Peru to Polynesia,
has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Heyerdahl, who was hospitalized recently, died of brain cancer
Thursday at the family retreat in Colla Micheri in northern Italy.</LD>
<LD>   In 1947, Heyerdahl and five Scandinavian companions set sail on their
raft from the port of Callao in Lima, Peru, to demonstrate Heyerdahl's
controversial theory that the South Pacific islands may have been settled
by ancient Peruvian Indians using similar watercraft--a theory that
defied the prevailing anthropological view that all South Pacific peoples
originally came from Southeast Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics warned the Oslo University-trained zoologist that his
primitive balsa sailing vessel, named after the Peruvian sun god, would
become waterlogged and sink within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But after 4,300 nautical miles and 101 days at sea, the Kon-Tiki
landed on an uninhabited Polynesian atoll.</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl's feat didn't prove that ancient South Americans had reached
Polynesia, but it did show that the prehistoric rafts of Peru were
capable of making long voyages over the open ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The voyage of the Kon-Tiki captured the imagination of a postwar
public and made the raft's blue-eyed captain a global celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl's lively chronicle of his remarkable voyage, "Kon-Tiki,
Across the Pacific by Raft," became a bestseller that has sold 30 million
copies and has been published in 67 languages. In 1951, a black and white
documentary of the voyage won an Academy Award.</TE>
<TE>   Hailed as a national hero in Norway, Heyerdahl was invited to the
White House and Buckingham Palace. When Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev later visited the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo, where the famous
raft is displayed, the Cold Warrior wistfully offered to serve as a cook
on the next expedition.</TE>
<TE>   Through organizing other raft voyages and archeological digs--in the
Galapagos Islands, Easter Island, Peru and elsewhere--Heyerdahl devoted
his life to searching for proof to support his theory that there was more
contact between peoples of the past than most anthropologists once
thought.</TE>
<TE>   "The Kon-Tiki expedition opened my eyes to what the ocean really is.
It is a conveyor and not an isolator," he wrote in the foreword of the
35th edition of "Kon-Tiki." "The ocean has been man's highway from the
days he built the first buoyant ships, long before he tamed the horse,
invented wheels and cut roads through the virgin jungles."</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, to demonstrate that other types of ancient vessels were
capable of transporting people across vast oceans, Heyerdahl and an
international crew of seven men headed west across the Atlantic from
Safi, Morocco, in a 50-foot papyrus reed boat of ancient Egyptian design
and named Ra in honor of the Egyptian sun god.</TE>
<TE>   After covering 2,700 miles in eight weeks, the Ra became waterlogged
in a storm and had to be abandoned 600 miles from Barbados in the West
Indies.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, Heyerdahl and his crew set sail again from Morocco in a new
papyrus reed boat named Ra II in 1970. They successfully completed the
3,270 nautical-mile voyage to Barbados in 57 days.</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl also organized and led a third voyage, aboard a
Sumerian-type reed boat called the Tigris, from Iraq to the Red Sea in
1977 to demonstrate the possibility of contact between the great ancient
civilizations of Mesopotamia, the Indus valley and Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   To help fund his many projects, Heyerdahl wrote many popular books,
including "Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island," which chronicled his
1955 archeological expedition on the Polynesian island closest to South
America.</TE>
<TE>   Although highly honored for his work--he received numerous gold medals
from geographical and anthropological societies around the world as well
as 11 honorary doctorates--Heyerdahl remained controversial throughout
his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was basically an adventurer, someone who felt passionately
about understanding the past and was willing to engage in all sorts of
nontraditional ways of making an argument," said Richard Burger, a
professor of anthropology at Yale University, who met Heyerdahl several
times.</TE>
<TE>   But Burger said most scientists remain skeptical of Heyerdahl's theory
that ancient South Americans reached Polynesia.</TE>
<TE>   "There are various pieces of [archeological] evidence that people
might argue over," he said, "The general consensus right now is if there
was contact it was probably not terribly significant."</TE>
<TE>   As for Heyerdahl's view that there was intercontinental contact
between early civilizations, Burger said, "there is even more skepticism
about that."</TE>
<TE>   The more widely accepted view, he said, is that there was more
independent development throughout the world than was previously
appreciated--that similar characteristics such as pyramid building arose
spontaneously in different areas.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, never caused Heyerdahl to veer from the course he
set more than six decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't listen to the people who sit behind desks and think they know
everything," he told the Chicago Tribune in 1991. "It is utterly
illogical to think cultures developed independently without direct
contact after man developed seagoing vessels about 5,000 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Sandweiss, a professor of anthropology at the University of Maine
who worked with Heyerdahl in Peru, believes he'll be best remembered for
the Kon-Tiki voyage.</TE>
<TE>   "It just captured the public imagination in such a tremendous way for
putting his life on the line to support his scientific theories,
Sandweiss said. "He put his life and money on the line over and over
again."</TE>
<TE>   All of Heyerdahl's voyages, Sandweiss said, were made to eliminate the
idea that contacts between peoples in the past at particular times were
impossible because of a lack of boating technology.</TE>
<TE>   Sandweiss, a co-author of Heyerdahl's 1995 book "Pyramids of Tucume,"
said that in the last decade "fairly definitive archeological proof has
come out" showing contact between South America and Polynesia in
prehistory.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of Thor's detractors have never appreciated that he really was a
scientist," Sandweiss said, "and he's a scientist because he had creative
ideas and he tested them. He understood tests are not proof. They're
support for an idea or against an idea."</TE>
<TE>   From a scientific point of view, Sandweiss said, "the most important
things that Thor has done in his life is to have new ideas and to force
the scientific world to react to them."</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl was born in the coastal town of Larvik, Norway, on Oct. 6,
1914. His father was the president of a brewery and mineral water plant;
his mother was chairwoman of the Larvik Museum. As the only child of two
older parents, he found himself spoiled and overly protected while
growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "I reacted against them by going on treks with a Greenland dog,
braving storms and sleeping in the snow just to prove that I could do
things alone," he told a British reporter in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, for a man who risked his life on perilous seafaring
expeditions, Heyerdahl had a childhood fear of water: At age 5, he nearly
drowned after falling into an ice hole in a frozen lake.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1936, after studying zoology and geography at the University
of Oslo, Heyerdahl and his wife, Liv, moved to the Polynesian island of
Fatu Hiva, where they spent a year living a primitive life and conducting
botanical and zoological research.</TE>
<TE>   On Fatu Hiva, Heyerdahl first began piecing together his theory about
an early South American connection to Polynesia.</TE>
<TE>   He discovered a number of plants that were native to South America,
including the sweet potato. He also observed that the trade winds blew in
from the east--across 4,000 miles of ocean from the coast of South
America.</TE>
<TE>   And he met an old native man who told him about the legend of the
god-chief known as Tiki.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Tiki who brought my ancestors to these islands where we live
now," the old man said. "Before that, we lived in a big country beyond
the sea."</TE>
<TE>   It struck Heyerdahl that the huge stone figures of Tiki in the jungles
greatly resembled the monoliths left by extinct civilizations in South
America.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Oslo, Heyerdahl published a book on his South Seas
adventure ("On the Hunt for Paradise") and quit his zoological studies to
begin researching the legendary Tiki.</TE>
<TE>War Interrupted Career</TE>
<TE>   By 1940, Heyerdahl had begun investigating whether Native Americans as
far away as the coast of the Pacific Northwest may also have reached the
South Seas. That year, he was studying rock carvings in British Columbia
that bore many similarities to ones done in Polynesia when the Germans
invaded Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Returning home, he joined the Free Norwegian armed forces, serving
primarily as a parachutist.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Heyerdahl failed to interest New York publishers in his
manuscript, "Polynesia and America: A Study of Prehistoric Relations."
And scientists scoffed at his notion that prehistoric men could have
crossed the vast Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The only way his theory could gain credence, he thought, was to show
how it would have been done.</TE>
<TE>   After finding funding for his project and assembling his crew, he
headed for Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Working from drawings of ancient Peruvian vessels, he supervised the
building of a reproduction of a primitive raft using 12 huge balsa logs
bound together with hand-woven hemp ropes. No nails or other metal
materials were used.</TE>
<TE>   Split bamboo was used for the 45-foot raft's deck and bamboo canes and
slats formed a small open cabin on the stern. The raft, which had a long
steering oar, was topped with a large square sail decorated with a
likeness of Kon-Tiki.</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl and his crew left the Callao harbor on April 28, 1947. After
enduring lulls and storms in which they had to tie themselves down so
they wouldn't be washed overboard, they ended their 101-day voyage by
smashing into a coral reef on an uninhabited Polynesian atoll east of
Tahiti.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the feat, Heyerdahl's critics still discounted his theory.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't understand how a guy from Norway who was not an
academic could do something they said couldn't be done," Heyerdahl told
the Chicago Tribune. "Before Kon-Tiki, nobody thought ancient Peruvians
navigated the oceans. Recent excavations have proven there was a highly
developed maritime culture."</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, Heyerdahl organized and led the first archeological
expedition to the Galapagos Islands 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador.
In examining pottery fragments, his team of archeologists determined that
the predecessors of the Incas had visited the island 1,000 years before
Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, Heyerdahl led the first real archeological expedition to
Easter Island, the Polynesian island 2,000 miles off the Chilean coast
where he laid the foundation of Easter Island's prehistory.</TE>
<TE>   Although many scientists disagree with his interpretations, Heyerdahl
concluded that the architectural record showed several periods of
occupation: two by South Americans and the final one by Polynesians.</TE>
<TE>On to Peru and Pyramids</TE>
<TE>   By the late '80s, Heyerdahl had moved to Tucume, Peru, where he
organized an archeological project to excavate the largest complex of
pyramids in the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   His team of archeologists discovered mud friezes showing reed rafts,
which demonstrated the importance of seafaring to the area's ancient
people, as well as objects that suggest a link to Easter Island.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew him describe Heyerdahl as a man of integrity and good
humor, a gentleman in the old-fashioned sense of the word.</TE>
<TE>   A charismatic man who spoke five languages and wrote more than a dozen
books, Heyerdahl could hold readers in thrall with his written prose and
charm audiences with his oftentimes poetic speech.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees things from his own angle--quite different very often from
the real scientists," longtime friend and fellow archeologist Oystein
Koch Johansen once said of him. "Thor very often believes in myths and
oral stories and used them more or less as guidebooks."</TE>
<TE>   And Heyerdahl never lost his boundless capacity for wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "Standing with him on the rim of Vesuvius is like being with a child
on New Year's Eve," Thor Heyerdahl Jr. said of his father, then 80, in
1995. "He still exhausts everyone, and if anything, he's getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl's final project took him to Azov, a Russian town on the Don
River delta.</TE>
<TE>   Early last year--at 86--he put up $100,000 to begin digging for traces
of the lost city of Asgard, where, according to an epic history of Norway
by 13th century Icelandic poet and chieftain Snorri Sturluson, once lived
a great conqueror named Odin.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Heyerdahl faced critics, who say Odin and the lost city of
Asgard are pure mythology. Scoffed a University of Oslo professor of
early Norse religions: "It's like digging for the Garden of Eden."</TE>
<TE>   But Heyerdahl, whose book "The Hunt for Odin," was published in Norway
last year, remained characteristically unmoved by his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not my theory," he told Newsweek in August. "It's Snorri's.
I'm just putting it to the test. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   After his recent hospitalization, he returned to the Colla Micheri
estate he bought and restored in the 1950s and refused further treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to go there, to use his words, because it was time to hand
up his oars and ride into the sunset," his son told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Heyerdahl is survived by his third wife, Jacqueline, a former actress
and onetime Miss France; four children; eight grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>A Justice Born for the Ages</HD>
<DH>John Paul Stevens turns 82 on Saturday and is the oldest Supreme
Court member. And he's still one of the best thinkers and writers on the
bench.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Arguing before the Supreme Court is not for the timid or the easily
unnerved.</LD>
<LD>   The justices interrupt the lawyers with ever-sharper questions. Then
when an attorney tries to offer an answer, he is likely to be cut off by
scornful jabs from other justices.</LD>
<LD>   But nearly every contentious argument has a gentle interval. Sitting
quietly in the middle of the bench is the white-haired Justice John Paul
Stevens, sporting a bow tie and broad-rimmed glasses. He watches intently
like an old owl, waiting until the fury of his colleagues subsides.</LD>
<TE>   "Counsel, may I inquire about one aspect of your argument?" he
sometimes begins, leaning forward as if in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Unfailingly courteous, Stevens never attacks the lawyers, mocks their
arguments or wisecracks at their expense. He listens intently to their
answers.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you clarify what you mean?" he asks one advocate. "I'm not sure I
understand your position," he tells another.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court's oldest and most polite justice turns 82 on
Saturday, but there are few signs he is slowing down or tiring of the
job. Indeed, Stevens has the buoyant energy of a person decades younger,
and he remains one of the court's quickest wits, sharpest thinkers and
best writers.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed in 1975 by President Ford, Stevens was lauded from the start
as exceedingly smart, strictly nonpartisan and highly independent.</TE>
<TE>   But he was also seen as something of a puzzle. He did not line up with
the dominant liberals, such as William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood
Marshall, who believed the death penalty was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   He also steered away from the conservatives, who wanted to roll back
the right to abortion and break down the "wall of separation" between
church and state. Stevens went his own way and had a reputation in legal
circles of being unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what to make of a judge who doesn't have an agenda,"
said Kenneth Manaster, a Santa Clara University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Manaster's recent book, "Illinois Justice," describes how Stevens
emerged as a figure of old-fashioned integrity in a Chicago scandal that
brought down two of the state's top judges.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, Manaster said, has "a real commitment to following the law,
case by case. That doesn't make for an easy headline, but it's exactly
what a judge should do."</TE>
<TE>   However, as the aged liberals on the court departed and the majority
shifted right, Stevens emerged as one of most influential justices and
leader of its liberal wing. Next in seniority to Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, he assigns the writing of opinions when the chief justice is
not in the majority.</TE>
<TE>   There is debate among legal academics over whether Stevens moved to
the left or stayed the same while the court moved to the right. Either
way, Stevens has become the most consistently liberal voice on a
conservative-leaning court.</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, he is speaking in dissent. Frequently, he does so
with dismay, as if to say his colleagues have failed to live up to their
high calling.</TE>
<TE>   When the court ended the Florida recount in the Bush vs. Gore case,
Stevens' dissent was memorable.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of
the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the
loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as
the impartial guardian of the rule of law," he concluded.</TE>
<TE>He Writes His Own Opinions</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his colleagues, he insists on writing his own opinions, often
drafting them at home early in the morning. He then has his clerks fill
in the footnotes and citations.</TE>
<TE>   Clerks are awed by his ability to write clear decisions quickly and by
his phenomenal memory.</TE>
<TE>   "He would disappear over the weekend and come back with several
opinions written," said Randolph Moss, a former Justice Department lawyer
who clerked for Stevens in the early 1990s. "He would mention he wrote
something on that a while ago and that it's at [Volume] 447, about
[citation] 557 or 558."</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Court opinions are published in volumes and lawyers rely on
the citations to those volumes. But few can remember volume and page
citations.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure enough, you would go look up Volume 447 at 557, and there would
be the opinion to cite," Moss said.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens also believes he and his clerks must look at all appeal
petitions that arrive at the court--more than 7,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   The other eight justices "pool" their law clerks and assign one of
them to digest each petition. That person, usually a recent law school
graduate, writes a memo setting forth the legal issue and recommending
whether it be heard by the full court or dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens uses three clerks, not the usual four. And over the years, he
has had more minorities and women as clerks than any other justice, as
well as several with physical disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   His wide-ranging opinions include a landmark ruling that allowed the
government to regulate "indecent" broadcasts on radio and television in
the famous case involving comedian George Carlin's "seven dirty words."
He has questioned why pornography has been given the highest free-speech
protection but advertising has not.</TE>
<TE>   The World War II veteran read an impassioned dissent in 1989 when the
court upheld the burning of the American flag as protected free
expression.</TE>
<TE>   And soon after joining the court, Stevens cast a key vote to restore
the constitutionality of capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he also steadily supported civil rights laws, a woman's right to
abortion and the separation of church and state doctrine--views that have
made him anathema to some conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Susan Estrich, who clerked for Stevens in 1977,
calls him "a throwback to a less rancorous era, when law and politics
were noble pursuits, not blood sports."</TE>
<TE>Ex-Law Dean Gives Stevens Top Marks</TE>
<TE>   Former Northwestern University law dean Robert Bennett has called
Stevens "the finest the American legal system has to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens graduated first in his Northwestern Law School Class of 1947,
and "we like to brag about him," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens' boyhood in the 1920s offered him a glimpse of the wider
world. His father built the largest hotel in Chicago along South Michigan
Avenue. Now called the Chicago Hilton and Towers, it was first known as
the Stevens Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He met some of the greatest figures of the era, visiting the suite of
Charles Lindbergh, who was touring the country after his New
York-to-Paris flight in 1927, and Amelia Earhart, the aviation pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   He also recalls a trip to Wrigley Field for the 1932 World Series.
Babe Ruth pointed to the grand stands and hit the next pitch there, the
famous "called-shot" home run.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Stevens was an
English major. He joined the Navy on Dec. 6, 1941, and won a Bronze Star
for his work as a code breaker.</TE>
<TE>   "He has both remarkable intelligence and great modesty, and that's not
a combination you find frequently," Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   His unassuming manner has even fooled his next-door neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Maryan, have a condominium in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and during much of the year, Stevens flies south for long weekends. But
many of his neighbors and tennis partners apparently do not know that the
genial white-haired lawyer from Washington is a member of the Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Though a registered Republican, Stevens was never involved in partisan
politics. Oddly enough, he was propelled to the high court by two
political scandals.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1969, Sherman Skolnick, a Chicago gadfly, loudly
accused the Illinois Supreme Court justices of corruption, and the
Chicago newspapers picked up the charge. A state court commission was set
up to look into the allegations, and its members asked Stevens, a
little-known Chicago lawyer, to serve as something of an independent
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   He took no pay for the work, but within six weeks he investigated the
charges, took depositions from the key participants, heard testimony in
public from the justices and wrote a final report. It found that two
justices, Roy Solfisburg and Ray Klingbiel, had secretly taken stock in a
Chicago bank that was controlled by a Democratic Party operative,
Theodore Isaacs. They then voted as justices to throw out a criminal
indictment against Isaacs.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Stevens filed his report, the two justices resigned.
Stevens sought no publicity for himself. He did not hold news conferences
or do television interviews.</TE>
<TE>   He was widely praised for his performance, and in 1970, Sen. Charles
Percy of Illinois persuaded President Nixon to appoint him to U.S. 7th
Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, after the Watergate scandal toppled Nixon, President Ford
turned to Stevens after legendary liberal Justice William O. Douglas
retired. Stevens had been recommended by Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi.
Stevens had taught at the University of Chicago Law School, where Levi
served as dean.</TE>
<TE>   The nomination was met with universal praise, and three weeks later,
he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>He Speaks Out Against Conservative Activism</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Stevens has spoken against the conservative activism
of his colleagues. They have struck down a series of federal laws, such
as the Violence Against Women Act and the Gun-Free School Zones Act, and
have said these measures invade the "sovereignty" of the states.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens has dissented each time. Often, he tweaks his conservative
colleagues by citing their words against them.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, for example, the court struck down California's "open
primary" law as a violation of the free-speech rights of the state
parties.</TE>
<TE>   "A state's power to determine how its officials are elected is a [key
element] of its sovereignty," Stevens said in dissent. "In my view, the
principles of federalism require us to respect the policy choices made by
the state's voters in approving Proposition 198."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens also protested when the conservatives set aside New Jersey's
ban on discrimination against gays and lesbians in a case brought by the
Boy Scouts of America. Speaking for the four dissenters, Stevens said he
did not see how the anti-bias law violated the 1st Amendment. "The court
does not accord this courageous state the respect that it is its due," he
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   When several justices called for striking down campaign funding limits
as a free-speech violation, Stevens wrote the clearest defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is property; it's not speech," he wrote. "Speech has the power
to inspire volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on the campaign
trail, on a battleground, or even on a football field. Money, meanwhile,
has the power to pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks." Since the
government can regulate property, it should be permitted to regulate
campaign money as well, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps his best-known dissents came in the Bush vs. Gore case that
ended the Florida election recount and cleared the way for President
Bush's victory.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, Dec. 9, 2000, hours after the Florida Supreme
Court had ordered a statewide tally of the remaining untabulated ballots,
the Supreme Court stopped the count on a 5-4 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Within two hours, Stevens filed a dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "To stop the counting of legal votes, the majority today departs from
three venerable rules of judicial restraint that have guided the court
throughout its history," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule, he wrote, is to defer to state courts on questions of
state law. Second, to defer to other branches of the federal government
as called for by law. Disputes over electoral votes were to be decided by
the House of Representatives, according to federal law. And finally, to
wait to resolve constitutional claims until the evidence is in. In
Florida, the Republicans predicted the hand recount would be unfair and
urged the court to block it for that reason.</TE>
<TE>   "As a more fundamental matter, the Florida court's ruling [allowing
the full state recount] reflects the basic principle, inherent in our
Constitution and our democracy, that every legal vote should be counted."
Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>He's Also Strayed From Liberal Side</TE>
<TE>   His dissents are not always on the liberal side. Last June, a 5-4
decision threw out a drug prosecution against an Oregon man because
police had used a heat-sensing device to spot marijuana plants growing in
his house. Justice Antonin Scalia said it is unconstitutional to use
these extrasensory devices to detect wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Disagreeing, Stevens questioned the wisdom of outlawing sensing
devices that, for example, can detect chemicals used by bomb makers, a
dissent that seemed prescient after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens is not the oldest justice ever to serve. Oliver Wendell Holmes
retired at age 90 in 1932. Just over a decade ago, the court had three
justices who had passed their 80th birthdays: Brennan, Marshall and Harry
Blackmun. But they sat silently during the oral arguments and looked like
tired old men in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Stevens is a lively presence on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   He keeps up a busy exercise schedule as well. He plays tennis three
times a week, swims regularly and plays golf on occasion. He and his wife
play in competitive bridge tournaments. As one concession to age, he gave
up flying his airplane a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   His good health and energetic presence have enormous significance for
the court and the law. Stevens has been a key figure in the 5-4 majority
that supports the right to abortion. If he were to depart, President Bush
would have an opportunity to create an antiabortion majority.</TE>
<TE>   His continued presence is welcome for many lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't changed at all over the years," said Washington attorney
Carter G. Phillips, who argues regularly before the court. "He always
asks questions with the same grace and elegant style. You never get the
feeling he is trying to score points at your expense."</TE>
<TE>   He sits between Rehnquist and Scalia. Sometimes, he steps in to rescue
an attorney who has been thrown off-balance by Scalia's barrage of sharp
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Once, a flustered lawyer answered several questions by saying, "Well,
judge . . . "</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist reprimanded him and reminded the lawyer that the members of
the high court are "justices."</TE>
<TE>   "Counsel, you're in good company," Stevens said, propping up the
shaken advocate. "The Constitution makes the same mistake," since it too
speaks in less exalted terms of the "judges of the Supreme Court."</TE>

<HD>Robert Blake Arrested as Triggerman in Wife's Killing</HD>

<LD>Actor Robert Blake and his bodyguard were arrested Thursday in the
shooting death of Blake's wife last May outside a restaurant in Studio
City.</LD>
<LD>   The 68-year-old actor, best known for his role as a detective in the
television series "Baretta," was in custody on suspicion of murder and
could face the death penalty, police said. He had been questioned earlier
about the slaying of Bonny Lee Bakley, but authorities Thursday said for
the first time that he had been a suspect from the start.</LD>
<LD>   The veteran actor was taken into custody around 6 p.m. by about a
dozen Los Angeles police officers who surrounded the sprawling,
ranch-style home where he lived in the exclusive gated community of
Hidden Hills.</LD>
<TE>   About the same time as Blake's arrest, his bodyguard, Earle Caldwell,
46, was taken into custody in Burbank. Both men were taken to the Los
Angeles Police Department's downtown headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bonny Lee Bakley case is solved," Police Chief Bernard C. Parks
said Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert Blake shot Bonny Bakley," LAPD Capt. Jim Tatreau said. "The
motive was Robert Blake's contempt for Bonny Bakley and the marriage he
felt was forced upon him."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said police expect the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office to charge Blake with one count of murder with the special
circumstance of lying in wait and two counts of soliciting murder. Police
said he solicited two people other than Caldwell. The chief said Caldwell
will probably be charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said there is various physical evidence and significant
circumstantial evidence, including statements, that point to Blake as the
gunman.</TE>
<TE>   The murder weapon was a World War II-era, German-made handgun that
police found in a trash bin a few yards from the crime scene, police
said. The .38-caliber pistol that Blake said he was carrying that night
was not used, Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests came after an 11-month investigation that took detectives
to more than 20 states. The district attorney's office said decisions on
what charges will be filed against the two men will be made Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Cary W. Goldstein, who represents Bakley's sister, mother and
children, said Thursday that the family was gratified at the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "The family has stated all along that Robert and Earle were the
individuals they believe responsible for Bonny's death," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his attorney, Harland W. Braun, Blake has repeatedly
maintained his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that the real killer is out there," Braun said Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney said he has not seen the evidence against his client, but
"I assume they are not going to issue an arrest warrant for Robert Blake
without having something."</TE>
<TE>   Bakley, 44, was shot once in the head May 4 as she sat in the couple's
car a block from Vitello's, a Studio City restaurant where she and Blake
had just finished dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police that he had left her in the car and returned to the
restaurant to retrieve his .38-caliber handgun, which apparently had
slipped from his waistband. Blake, who is licensed to carry the weapon,
told police he carried it because Bakley feared for her safety.</TE>
<TE>   Blake said he walked back to his car to find his wife slumped in the
passenger seat, mortally wounded. He ran across the street to the home of
film director Sean Stanek and begged him to call 911. Blake also went
back to the restaurant in search of a doctor. Bakley died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officers had interviewed Blake and searched his Studio City home
at least twice since the shooting. During the searches, officers
confiscated several items, including two 9-millimeter pistols, more than
100 rounds of ammunition and some credit card receipts.</TE>
<TE>   Police also kept track of Blake's whereabouts. After the slaying, he
moved to the Hidden Hills home of his adult daughter, who has been
helping to care for the young daughter he had with Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   In the 11 months since the slaying, Braun has questioned whether
Bakley's criminal activity and unorthodox dating service could have
resulted in enemies who wanted her dead.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley had been convicted of identity fraud. Braun gave investigators
three trunks, four suitcases and several boxes containing copies of
letters, videotapes and nude photographs of Bakley that she allegedly
sent to lonely men--sometimes along with promises of sex--in exchange for
cash, plane tickets and bus fare.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein accused Blake and his lawyer of trying to delay the arrest
and suggesting that, in view of her lifestyle, Bakley's fate was
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Bashing Bonny is an attempt to precondition prospective jurors with
the subtle implication that she had it coming," Goldstein said in a
recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Bakley met in 1998 at a now-defunct Burbank jazz club.
Bakley gave birth to a daughter, Rose, in June 2000, and tests later
confirmed that Blake was the father.</TE>
<TE>   The couple married the following November at what was then the actor's
home in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley went to Arkansas after the wedding and didn't return until
March 2001, moving into a guest house the actor had built at the rear of
his property.</TE>
<TE>   The two apparently led mostly separate lives; their joint visit to the
restaurant on Tujunga Avenue was an unusual public outing together.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the killing, Blake moved to the Hidden Hills house,
where he lived with the adult daughter and his toddler.</TE>
<TE>   Margerry Bakley, the dead woman's sister, said recently that the last
year has been devastating for her family, which has had to contend with
the shock of the slaying and with media reports branding her sister as a
grifter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really hard, and the only people that can identify with us
are the people that have had a similar loss," the sister said. "What
hurts the most are the lies after the fact."</TE>
<TE>   Braun, Blake's attorney, said police contacted him at 5:30 p.m.
Thursday, requesting that he phone Blake and ask his client to cooperate
by going to the front of the house. Braun said he made the call.</TE>
<TE>   About 5:40 p.m. officers in unmarked vehicles rolled through the main
entrance to the gated community and deployed around the home. Police said
that, as requested, Blake was waiting for them at the open front door.</TE>
<TE>   Forty minutes later, several of the officers, some wearing protective
vests, led Blake from the home in handcuffs and placed him in the back of
a white, unmarked car. Trailed by news helicopters, the car drove to the
LAPD's Parker Center headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a green "Snoopy" baseball cap and a white sweatshirt inscribed
with the words, "I survived Jawbone Canyon," Blake walked briskly into
the police building, escorted by a detective. The canyon is north of
Mojave, Calif., in the Sierra foothills.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell, who worked as a handyman and bodyguard for the couple, was
trailed by unmarked police cars for almost 20 miles along Los
Angeles-area freeways before the officers stopped his Jeep in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Ordered out of the vehicle, Caldwell followed police orders to lie
down on the pavement in a spread-eagle position before he was handcuffed
and taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell told The Times last year that he knew both Blake and Bakley
well and had gone on a gambling trip to Arizona with them a few weeks
before the shooting. Police said Thursday that Caldwell was believed to
be "out of town" at the time Bakley was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said he believes there are several other possible suspects,
including a man Bakley met through an adult magazine and an armed robber
who worked that neighborhood in the weeks leading up to Bakley's death.
The lawyer also theorized that a hit man Bakley hired to kill Blake
turned on her instead.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, born Mickey Gubitosi in New Jersey, began his acting career as
a child, starring in the "Our Gang" movies of the 1930s. His later film
credits included the role of a young boy in the John Huston classic "The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre."</TE>
<TE>   In "Baretta," a popular television series that ran from 1975 until
1978, Blake played a scrappy, streetwise cop who lived in a rundown hotel
with his pet cockatoo, Fred.</TE>
<TE>   After the show was canceled, Blake suffered through a bout with
depression and alcohol abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Script battles and personality clashes reportedly wearied producers,
and major acting roles became increasingly infrequent.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, he made a television movie, "Father of Hell Town," that
turned into another series. By his own account, sleeping pills, junk food
and a fear that he might kill himself drove him to quit the series after
16 episodes.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Urges L.A. to Fight Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn declared Thursday that Los Angeles must remain
whole or abandon its identity. He called on every resident to join the
fight against secession--a campaign that he cast as vital for the city's
future and that, win or lose, will define Hahn's place in the history of
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Confronted with a slow economy, a tight budget and a fractious city,
the mayor used his first State of the City address to sound the alarm
against those who would break Los Angeles apart.</LD>
<LD>   "The reality is that a breakup will create more bureaucracy, more
politicians, fewer resources and diminished services," Hahn told about
1,000 students, city officials and other leaders gathered on the grassy
quad of James Monroe High School in North Hills. "Secession is not a
solution."</LD>
<TE>   The mayor's 25-minute speech came after the climax of the effort to
oust Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, and on the eve of his unveiling of
next year's city budget, which is expected to contain cuts in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents of the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the harbor
area are trying to break away from Los Angeles and create separate
municipalities. Advocates argue that Los Angeles has become too large to
function effectively, while opponents, including Hahn, say splitting the
city apart would accomplish nothing but create problems, both for the new
cities and for the one they would leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   Although the annual address typically represents the mayor's
opportunity to evaluate the city's well-being, Wednesday's speech
functioned less as a report on Los Angeles and more as a rallying cry
against secession.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor spoke before a large banner reading "Neighborhoods are Los
Angeles." He returned again and again to the notion that Los Angeles is
the sum of its communities and that dividing those places would destroy
the city's sense of itself and its place in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn recalled episodes of Los Angeles history, sounding a nostalgic
tone as he argued for preserving the city as it is.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you live in Lincoln Heights or Los Feliz, Winnetka or
Wilmington, Sunland or Sylmar, breaking apart this city destroys our
identity," Hahn said. "This is a city that dreams are made of, and I will
not let our dream be destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Hahn vowed to fight a vigorous campaign against secession,
signing up some of the city's top political consultants to run a campaign
called L.A. United. In recent weeks, however, city leaders have expressed
anxiety that Hahn has been distracted by the fight over Chief Parks and
has given secessionists an opening to make their case.</TE>
<TE>   But on Thursday, many of the city officials and civic leaders who
listened to the speech said Hahn's address would help unite Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to rev up, and I think that's what this speech was all
about," said City Controller Laura Chick. "The mayor was revving us up.
I'm revved--it worked on me."</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The lines have been drawn," he said. "It's imperative that we fight
secession movements with every bone in our body. And it will be at the
top of our agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Secession is expected to take center stage in city politics over the
next few months as the agency evaluating the feasibility of creating new
cities decides whether to put the individual breakaway movements on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Assn., an influential
downtown business lobbying group, said the mayor's address provided a
vital framework for the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I was delighted with the one-two punch he gave secession," she said.
"It was the most critical thing we were waiting for, and he delivered.
It's important that he does this every day and make a case [for] why it
is the worst thing that can happen to this city."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at the high school at the northwest edge of the city, more
than 20 miles from City Hall, Hahn argued that the improvements
secessionists are seeking will not happen if Los Angeles is split up.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District would not be affected by the
move, Hahn said, addressing a common misperception.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the mayor said, the new cities would not get better police
or tree-trimming services because they would have to contract with Los
Angeles to provide that work, at least initially. Programs could even be
reduced because the new municipalities might struggle financially, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "The one-sided sound-bite messages that we've been hearing from
secessionists have got to be answered, and we've got to answer them with
truth," Hahn said. "Breaking apart Los Angeles won't provide one dime of
additional money to a new city and will leave our remaining city
wounded."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's previous admonitions regarding secession have not slowed the
breakaway campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he did make some ground with a few secession advocates
who attended the address. Former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, one of the
founders of the secession group Valley VOTE, said the mayor laid out a
compelling case for keeping the city together.</TE>
<TE>   "What it did is give me a clear picture of what his focus is going to
be and how persuasive it will be to people throughout the city and the
Valley," she said. "The burden really lies on the pro-secession movement
to persuade people that a change needs to be made."</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, said Hahn's speech will
not win over people dissatisfied with city government.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of him increasing his rhetoric, he has to increase his
actions," said Close, who did not attend the address.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn used much of his speech to counter that impression and argue that
the city is in fact improving.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor noted that since he took office July 1, the LA's BEST
after-school program has expanded from 78 elementary schools to 101. The
city has opened new parks and made traffic improvements.</TE>
<TE>   He cited his efforts to increase the ranks of the Police Department,
saying that 780 new recruits will be brought in by next year.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also touted the growth of the new neighborhood council movement,
promising more money to the new groups for local improvement projects.</TE>
<TE>   "When you feel good about the street you live on, you're going to feel
good about the city you live in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn, those efforts form the core of his argument that Los Angeles
is worth keeping together. And his campaign to win support for that idea
is likely to crest in November, when residents may have the chance to
decide whether or not to stay with Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Join me," he urged. "Fight secession with truth. Protect what we have
all worked so hard for, our city of dreams."</TE>

<HD>Senate Blocks Oil Drilling in Arctic Reserve</HD>
<DH>Congress: Backers of exploration in the wildlife refuge fall well
short of needed votes, dealing Bush a major defeat and clouding future
energy legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Thursday blocked oil and gas drilling in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, handing President Bush a key defeat and
putting in doubt the future of comprehensive energy legislation.</LD>
<LD>   In the closely watched roll call, pro-exploration forces fell well
short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic-led filibuster
against the drilling plan. Only 46 senators voted to end the debate,
while 54 opposed the motion.</LD>
<LD>   Drilling advocates had hoped to win at least 50 votes. Their failure
to achieve that goal increased already steep odds against the proposal
being part of any final energy bill.</LD>
<TE>   Still, neither side in the dispute thought the vote would end the
decades-long debate on whether to open a portion of the 19-million-acre
refuge in Alaska's northeast corner to drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of the drilling say it would endanger one of the nation's most
precious wildlife habitats, and they exulted in their victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Development would irreversibly damage this natural resource," said
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a leader of the filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say environmentalists exaggerate the effect the drilling
would have on the tundra and decried their defeat as a blow to America's
need to decrease its dependence on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   "Domestic oil production . . . is critical to our national and
economic security," said Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho). "It is
unfortunate that the politics of the issue overtook the real facts
associated with America's energy needs."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans vowed to take the issue to the campaign trail in their
fight to regain a Senate majority that would be more receptive to the
drilling proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Bush included the proposal as a central component of the energy plan
his administration unveiled almost a year ago. After Thursday's vote,
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Senate "missed an
opportunity to lead America to greater energy independence."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Bush, who has been increasing his political appearances
as the 2002 campaign season heats up, would continue to push for the
drilling plan.</TE>
<TE>   But experts said its defeat underscores the limits of Bush's ability
to press his domestic agenda, even while enjoying strong public support
for his leadership in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The vote shows that the president does not have legislative
coattails," said Marshall Wittmann, a political scholar at the
conservative Hudson Institute think tank. "Those high presidential
numbers in polls don't translate into votes on Capitol Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Eight Republicans joined independent James M. Jeffords of Vermont and
45 Democrats--including Californians Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein--in voting to block the drilling. Five Democrats teamed with 41
Republicans to support it. The division mirrored the complexities of the
energy debate in which issues cut across party lines, often pitting
regional interests against partisan loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil one of his
domestic priorities, and it was unclear whether he would sign an energy
bill that does not include the Alaskan drilling initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was included in the energy bill passed by the
GOP-controlled House last year.</TE>
<TE>   The drilling debate is sure to be revived in House-Senate negotiations
over a final bill. But Craig, a GOP leader on energy policy, conceded
that Thursday's vote showed it would be "mighty tough" to win Senate
approval for a compromise bill that includes the drilling.</TE>
<TE>   And it remains uncertain whether Congress will even be able to produce
compromise legislation, given that both sides in the debate have now
suffered key losses. Earlier this year, a Democratic-led push for tougher
vehicle fuel-economy standards, a priority of environmentalists, was
derailed in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Support for the bill is ebbing for other reasons. Feinstein, for
example, has said she will vote against the measure as long as it
requires that ethanol, a form of alcohol made from corn and other crops,
be added to gasoline supplies as a way to make the fuel cleaner.
Midwestern lawmakers are adamant that energy legislation include the
ethanol requirement.</TE>
<TE>   But California officials are worried that the provision would lead to
a second energy crisis in the state because of logistic hurdles in
bringing hundreds of millions of gallons of ethanol from the Midwest to
California.</TE>
<TE>   "There really is nothing in [the energy bill] that is an incentive for
me to vote for," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many senators from both parties said they continue to support
the bill, which includes billions of dollars in tax incentives to promote
energy production and various conservation measures that have not proved
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, there is enough there to take it to conference and try to
get something on the president's desk," Craig said.</TE>
<TE>   A final Senate vote on an energy bill is expected within the next few
days.</TE>
<TE>   The Alaskan drilling issue sparked intense lobbying, pitting
environmentalists and labor groups against each other and featuring
emotional arguments in Capitol corridors, on the airwaves and in street
rallies over how much oil the drilling would provide, how many jobs it
would create and whether it would harm the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists applauded the filibuster leaders, Lieberman and Sen.
John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), as they emerged from the chamber. Both senators
are potential contenders for their party's 2004 presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   But Teamsters President James P. Hoffa called the Senate vote "a
betrayal of working Americans."</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters and other unions lobbied for the drilling because of
estimates it would create as many as 735,000 jobs nationwide. Drilling
foes argued the number would be as little as 65,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his allies had hoped the drilling plan would gain momentum
with the growing instability in the Middle East and recent gasoline price
spikes.</TE>
<TE>   "An energy policy without [the Alaskan drilling plan] is not
complete," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.). "I do not
want to say I told you so, but when the gasoline prices go up, when
supplies cause dislocation, when we have rolling brownouts, it will be
traceable right back to this body and to this vote."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman accused proponents of selling the American public "fool's
gold, not black gold . . . a false promise of job creation, a false
promise of economic stimulus, a false promise of energy independence and
a false promise of environmental sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way for us to remove our economy from the troubles in the
Middle East is to end our dependence on foreign oil," he said. ". . . We
have to stop our consumption, not encourage it by opening our sacred
places to oil development."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry argued that Arctic oil would do little to wean the U.S. off oil
imports.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't drill your way out of this problem," he said, contending
that the country doesn't have enough oil reserves to feed its appetite.
"We have to invent our way out of this challenge."</TE>
<TE>   The government estimates there are 6 billion to 16 billion barrels of
oil beneath the tundra, though opponents argue that only about 3.2
billion can be recovered economically. The United States uses about 7
billion barrels of oil a year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and others contended that technological advancements have made it
possible to extract the oil without damaging the environment, an
assertion that opponents disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), in vowing to continue the fight,
said of the Senate vote, "What it proves is we need more Republicans in
the U.S. Senate."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the GOP-controlled Congress approved the drilling, but it was
vetoed by President Clinton.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela President Must Embrace Democracy, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The U.S. government seeks to manage fallout from the
failed coup as regional leaders debate what happened, and why.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Brushing aside questions about the U.S. response to last week's
failed coup in Venezuela, President Bush declared Thursday that the
leftist president who survived the threat must prove that he is a friend
of democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's warning to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez came as the
Organization of American States convened a special meeting to consider
the events that drove Chavez from power and then brought him back.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very important for him to embrace those institutions which are
fundamental to democracy," Bush said of Chavez, "including freedom of
press and freedom for the ability [of] the opposition to speak out."</LD>
<TE>   Hours after Bush spoke, the Venezuelan foreign minister told the OAS,
which represents the 35 nations of the Western Hemisphere, that the
Chavez administration had deep respect for the rule of law and for
democratic freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all that has happened," said Foreign Minister Luis Alfonso
Davila, "at this moment not a single Venezuelan newspaper has been shut
down, nor has a television or radio station, nor has any member of the
media been imprisoned."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at OAS headquarters in Washington, Davila asserted that
Venezuelan society has never enjoyed as much freedom of expression as it
has under Chavez, who was first elected president in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The remarks by Bush and Davila continued the debate about what
happened in Venezuela last week and what will happen next in the
important oil-producing country.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke in a brief session with reporters in the Oval Office, with
President Andres Pastrana of Colombia, a U.S. ally and neighbor of
Venezuela, at his side.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, who seeks to forge better relations with Latin America,
managing the fallout of the abortive Venezuelan coup--which his
administration was slow to condemn--is emerging as an important
diplomatic test.</TE>
<TE>   Bush insisted that his administration was "very clear" in its support
of democracy during the upheaval in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, and
"did not support any extra-constitutional action."</TE>
<TE>   But on Capitol Hill, a senior administration official acknowledged
that the U.S. response "wasn't what it should have been."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, responding to questions
from House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), said the Bush
administration "didn't have any involvement, not to my knowledge" in the
attempt to oust Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage told a House Appropriations subcommittee that in the
aftermath of the coup, "formulation of the U.S. statement wasn't what it
should have been."</TE>
<TE>   The coup began April 11 when a rebellious faction of the Venezuelan
military announced an end to the Chavez regime after an anti-government
protest turned violent. On April 12, when Chavez was taken into custody,
the White House expressed no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   But Latin American leaders raised an immediate outcry, and the OAS
subsequently condemned the coup in a U.S.-backed resolution. Chavez
returned to power early Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   This week, attention has focused on the Bush administration's actions
before and during the attempted coup. Administration officials, skeptical
of many Chavez policies, including his pro-Cuba stance, acknowledge
having had contact with anti-Chavez groups beforehand. But they
vigorously deny approving any unconstitutional attempt to topple Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   At the OAS meeting, Secretary-General Cesar Gaviria, a former
Colombian president, delivered a report on a fact-finding trip to
Caracas.</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria made no mention of the United States in his report. He
concluded that the coup leaders were not the same as the leaders of the
massive street protests on April 11 and preceding days.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he said, the coup attempt "was the result of decisions taken
by the military."</TE>
<TE>   Gaviria said that "this alteration of constitutional order was
reversed by the reaction of a considerable number of officers of the
armed forces and by a vigorous reaction by citizens--both defenders and
opponents of the government of President Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   He recommended that Venezuela adopt reforms to curb political
involvement by the military. He also urged that government probes into
the events of April 11 be fair and open, meting out full punishment to
those responsible.</TE>
<TE>   In modern times, many Latin American countries have been beset by
coups that have overturned constitutional governments. But in recent
years the region has stiffened its resolve to promote democracy. Last
year, the nations of the Western Hemisphere adopted a tough pro-democracy
policy at the Summit of the Americas in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Bush in January reiterated that policy, declaring in a speech to Latin
American leaders that "democracy is the nonnegotiable demand of human
dignity" and that "the future of this hemisphere depends on the strength
of three commitments: democracy, security and market-based development."</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks Thursday, Bush sought to assure Latin America and the
world that he remained committed to that vision. "My administration spoke
with a very clear voice about our strong support of democracy," he told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the Pentagon said it had suspended anti-drug
training with Venezuela and was assessing what to do about other
military-to-military programs.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Southern Command said two dozen U.S. Army trainers whose
planned trip to Venezuela last Friday was delayed by the coup were told
Sunday that the trip was off for now.</TE>

<HD>Airplane Hits Skyscraper in Milan; 3 Die</HD>
<DH>Italy: Crash sparks fears of terrorism, but officials say pilot of
the small craft reported mechanical trouble. Suicide motive is also under
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy
</DL>
<LD>A 67-year-old businessman, flying solo and off-course after
reporting mechanical trouble, plowed his small plane into Milan's tallest
skyscraper Thursday, killing himself and two other people in a fiery
scene that echoed the attack on New York's World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   As black smoke billowed from the wreckage 25 stories above downtown
Milan, Italian authorities said the crash, which occurred in a clear sky,
appeared to be accidental. Later, they said they were checking reports
that the pilot had been in financial trouble and might have had a suicide
motive.</LD>
<LD>   At least 60 people were injured. The explosive sound of the crash and
the image of a scarred and smoking tower, disgorging office workers
spattered with blood, caused panic here over a possible terrorist attack
and sent stock prices into a brief tumble in Europe and the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush was quickly notified of the crash, and the FBI was
assisting in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The initial information . . . leads us to lean toward an accident" as
the cause, Interior Minister Claudio Scajola later told reporters in
Rome, tentatively ruling out a terrorist strike.</TE>
<TE>Pilot Reported Trouble</TE>
<TE>   The twin-engine Rockwell Commander punched through the 25th floor of
the 30-story Pirelli building about 5:50 p.m., past normal working hours
for most of the 1,300 people employed there by the Lombardy regional
government. Officials said fewer people than usual were on the top five
floors, which were undergoing renovation.</TE>
<TE>   "We all rushed to the window, and we suddenly realized it was
something similar to the World Trade towers because thousands of pieces
of paper were flying through the air," said Maurizio Sala, a civil
servant who works on the 20th floor. "It was the same image."</TE>
<TE>   The three dead were the pilot, a cleaning woman and a government
lawyer, officials said. Three hours after the crash, rescue workers found
a survivor on the 25th floor.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot was identified as Gino Fasulo, an Italian-born resident of
Pregassona, Switzerland. They said he was approaching Milan's Linate
Airport after a 20-minute flight over the Alps from the Swiss town of
Locarno.</TE>
<TE>   The pilot reported "a little problem with the landing gear," and the
control tower instructed him to move to the west of the airport until it
was fixed, the Italian air traffic controllers association said in a
statement issued late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the statement, the control tower contacted the pilot
again after seeing he was drifting to the north, in the wrong direction,
the statement added. The pilot said he was fixing the problem, and the
tower instructed him to move back into position to land. But the pilot
again didn't get into the right position, it said, and the control tower
then lost contact.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't able to land, so he swung toward the city center--something
he absolutely shouldn't have done," said Alfredo Roma, head of Italy's
civil aviation authority.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Artoni, an editor of the Italian flight magazine Volare, said
the Rockwell Commander has a hand pump attached to the floor that can be
used as a backup method to deploy the landing gear when the button on the
control panel fails. He speculated that the pilot might have been working
the pump and lost sight of where the plane was heading.</TE>
<TE>   Pietro Marci, a former president of the Locarno flying club, said
Fasulo had 30 years of flying experience. He said another club member saw
the pilot shortly before takeoff and that he appeared to be in good
health.</TE>
<TE>'Everyone Was Stunned'</TE>
<TE>   A flight instructor at the same club, Luca Predolini, told Italy's
ANSA news agency that Fasulo was "a bit of a cowboy pilot" who once ran
out of fuel and nearly crashed his plane.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, two Italian television networks received and telecast
anonymous tips that the pilot, who reportedly traded in artwork, was in
financial trouble. An e-mail read by talk show host Bruno Vespa on
Italian state TV said that tax authorities had seized $1.2 million from
Fasulo recently. It gave no details.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Emilio Fede, director of Italy's privately owned Rete 4
station, announced that he had received a phone call late Thursday from a
man who identified himself and claimed that Fasulo owed him hundreds of
thousands of dollars. The caller, whom Fede did not identify on the air,
said he had been threatening to report Fasulo to the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials said they were investigating both reports as a
possible motive for a suicide crash.</TE>
<TE>   Luigi Fasulo, a nephew of the pilot, appeared on Vespa's program and
dismissed the claims. "He had no financial or health problems," the
nephew said. "He loved life."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that a
plane has struck a high-rise building. On Jan. 5, a 15-year-old boy
flying alone crashed a stolen plane into a building in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   That boy, Charles Bishop, left behind a suicide note saying that Al
Qaeda terrorists had tried to recruit him, but police said there was no
truth to the claim. Relatives of the boy, who was the only one to die in
the crash, have filed a lawsuit claiming that the acne drug Accutane
prompted him to commit suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Italians immediately assumed the Milan crash was a terrorist act. The
city has been a center of alleged terrorist plotting by North African
immigrants whom Italian investigators have linked to Al Qaeda. On March
27, the U.S. State Department issued a warning for Americans traveling in
Milan and three other Italian cities around the Easter holiday.</TE>
<TE>   A North African immigrant who works as a doorman at the Gallia Hotel,
describing the crash from his post across the Piazza Duca d'Aosta from
the Pirelli building, said he was so certain that Al Qaeda was behind the
attack that he refused to give his name for fear of reprisals.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a sound as if a plane were landing," the doorman recalled.
"When I looked up, I saw the tail of the aircraft and then immediately
afterward an explosion. There was glass and paper flying out in all
directions. A person I work with fainted. It all seemed so unreal. I had
goose bumps for two hours afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was stunned, and we were inhaling the smoke," he said. "Soon
afterward, the piazza filled with people, and people were running out of
the hotel frantically."</TE>
<TE>   Milan's main train station, about 200 yards from the skyscraper, was
quickly evacuated and train service was halted. After-hours trading was
suspended on the Milan stock market, which was already closed for the
day.</TE>
<TE>   The 415-foot-tall Pirelli structure, built in 1958, is a Milan
landmark, Italy's first skyscraper and one of the world's tallest
concrete buildings. Its diamond-shaped floor plan has inspired designs
around the world, including the MetLife building in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The crash left gaping holes on both sides of the 25th floor. A large
section of that floor lost its walls, and smoke poured from the gash in
one side of the building. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze,
but smoke still flowed from the building late into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan de la Torre, a 35-year-old Ecuadorean immigrant, was cleaning
carpets on the 19th floor when the plane hit.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know anything about it until I heard this huge explosion,"
he said. "At first I thought it was my machine that had blown up, but
then I saw flames outside the window."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers in orange uniforms helped the injured as ambulances
streamed into the area. Several people were rescued from elevators. At
least 20 people were hospitalized, including a woman with serious burns.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Paplini, who works in a nearby Internet cafe called Il
Boomerang, was standing outside the shop when the plane crashed into the
high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw flames shoot out of the side of the building," Paplini said.
"Then the building started to burn. People were running past me. Some
were crying."</TE>

<HD>Ex-King Is Thrilled to Be Home</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Mohammad Zaher Shah returns quietly in a tense
political atmosphere. His future role is vague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Former king Mohammad Zaher Shah had just a handful of simple words
for the Afghan people after he returned to the country Thursday: It was
the happiest day of his life.</LD>
<LD>   Those who accompanied the 87-year-old ex-monarch said he couldn't
wrench his eyes away from the mountains of Afghanistan as his plane flew
over them, and he had tears in his eyes as he stepped onto the ground at
Kabul's airport after 29 years in exile.</LD>
<LD>   In a short airport ceremony, strangely quiet and anticlimactic, Zaher
Shah moved through a crowd of dignitaries before being whisked away in a
motorcade, with few people lining the streets to wave or cheer. No
official announcement had been made, mainly for security reasons.</LD>
<TE>   Zaher Shah was escorted from his house near Rome to the Afghan capital
by Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's interim government leader, who, like the
former king, is an ethnic Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-monarch's presence is expected to boost Karzai's power and
offset that of former Northern Alliance figures, ethnic Tajiks who
control the key Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministries.</TE>
<TE>   "The king is returning to his country at a time when it is secure, and
I hope it will bring about stability and result in the rehabilitation of
Afghanistan," Karzai said after Zaher Shah's return. "It is an unusual
moment. Refugees are coming from Iran, Pakistan and other places, and the
king is coming home to his country."</TE>
<TE>   Government members are vague about precisely what role Zaher Shah will
be allowed to play. He returns as an ordinary citizen, not a monarch, and
there are few calls to make him king again. His main task in coming
months is to convene a loya jirga, or grand council, in June to select
Afghanistan's next leader and government.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a day for recrimination or criticism from those who oppose
the former king--including moujahedeen fighters and Northern Alliance
commanders who fought the radical Islamic Taliban regime and control much
of the country outside Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   But the tensions over Zaher Shah's return, boiling beneath the
surface, suggest the problems he will have in unifying the nation, the
role he has adopted for himself.</TE>
<TE>   With U.S. backing for the former king's return strong, figures
associated with the Northern Alliance have muted their criticism of him.
But they frame their complaints in subtle ways, pointing out that Zaher
Shah is old and emphasizing that he is in Afghanistan as a private
citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to expectations, Afghanistan's currency weakened on Zaher
Shah's return, taking currency traders by surprise. Most lost money
Thursday, because traders had brought large amounts of afghanis to the
market, expecting to make money as the currency strengthened on the
former king's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah rested in his villa Thursday. In coming days, he is
expected to visit his father's tomb, a once-grand structure on a hill
overlooking Kabul. The tomb was badly damaged in fighting in the early
1990s, and the shattered roof and walls and graffiti-filled interior are
likely to be a devastating sight for the former king.</TE>
<TE>   State-owned local media gave Zaher Shah's arrival brief play, in
coverage that was almost curt compared with that of overseas media here.</TE>
<TE>   Kabul Radio described the former king's arrival in Kabul as "the only
hope for our brave compatriots."</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah is extremely popular among many ordinary Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to see him installed as our president, because we had a
good life in his era," said Mohammed Saber, 47, a government worker who
repairs bicycles to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say that as ruler for 40 years until he was deposed in
1973, Zaher Shah neglected Afghanistan's development.</TE>
<TE>   "He led the people in darkness," said Sarwar, 45, a former moujahedeen
fighter now serving as a soldier in a security tent near the tomb of
Zaher Shah's father. "During 22 years when there was fighting here, there
was bloodshed in the country," said Sarwar, who uses only one name. "Did
he raise his head? Did he take part in the fighting against enemies? No,
he did nothing. It's too late for him. His time is up."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah said it was a momentous and emotional
day for Afghanistan, but he was vague about Zaher Shah's role.</TE>
<TE>   "It will add to the sense of integrity and national unity and will
promote the political process," he said. The interim government will
consult with the former king "when necessary," Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be another reassurance to the people of Afghanistan that
these political processes are taking the right path," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah, who also traveled with Zaher Shah to Afghanistan, said the
former king was so excited about arriving in Afghanistan that he didn't
sleep during the overnight flight.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the rapid social change that followed the defeat of the
Taliban late last year, a group of women were present for Zaher Shah's
arrival at the Kabul airport, wearing head scarves instead of the
head-to-toe covering known as a burka.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very emotional moment," said one of the women, Najiba Qayum,
45, a professor at Kabul University. "I was thinking about how the king
must have felt, because he has been away for such a long time. It's very
difficult to be away from your country. You could kiss the soil."</TE>
<TE>   "For me, he is like my father and grandfather," said another woman,
Sima Tabib, 40, who works in a Geneva bank but wants to return home. "He
is the savior of Afghanistan. His return is really important for the
future of Afghanistan."</TE>

<HD>'Friendly Fire' Pilot Feared an Attack</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: He dropped a bomb that killed four Canadians after
deciding he was acting in self-defense, U.S. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The American F-16 pilot who dropped a bomb that killed four
Canadian soldiers early Thursday acted because flashes of gunfire from a
training exercise led him to believe that he was under attack, Pentagon
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In what became one of the deadliest "friendly fire" incidents of the
Afghan war, the Air National Guard pilot asked for permission to strike
the site where he saw muzzles flaring below him in the dark, but was
given approval only to mark the target and give it a second look, defense
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The pilot launched the 500-pound laser-guided bomb at 1:55 a.m. after
deciding that he was acting in self-defense, as pilots are sometimes
permitted to do, the officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The reservist apparently had not been told that he was flying over
Tarnak Farms, a desert landscape of sand and clay ringed by rocky cliffs
three miles south of the Kandahar air base. The former Al Qaeda training
camp has long been sealed off from the public and designated as a
coalition training area, routinely used by U.S., Canadian and other
forces.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 coalition soldiers were conducting night training with live
ammunition when the bomb struck, Gen. Raymond Henault, Canada's chief of
defense staff, told reporters in Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Four soldiers were killed instantly. Six others suffered serious
wounds and were flown to a hospital at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Two
soldiers with minor injuries were treated at the Kandahar base.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush informed Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien of the
incident by phone at 8 p.m. Wednesday and said Americans were "deeply
saddened" by the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   As Canadian officials and their U.S. counterparts launched separate
investigations, Canadian leaders expressed concern over the erroneous
bombing and said they hoped that any changes suggested by the inquiries
to prevent a recurrence would be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien voiced his concern before the Canadian House of Commons.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many questions," the prime minister said. "How has this
happened? I want to assure the families and the people of Canada that
these questions will be answered."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tension between the closely allied nations, Canadian and
American officials said the bombing would not affect the coalition's
cooperation in prosecuting the war.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not waiver in our mission despite this terrible tragedy,"
Henault said. "Our soldiers are no strangers to danger."</TE>
<TE>   The casualties were among an 880-member Canadian contingent, the
second-largest at the base after the Americans, with whom the Canadians
share duties such as guarding the gates, deactivating land mines and
patrolling. Canadian soldiers gathered around a bulletin board in the
main airport building to read official statements posted about the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "These young men were among the finest, bravest paratroops I have ever
soldiered with," said Canadian army Lt. Col. Pat Stogran, commander of
the killed soldiers' 3rd Battalion of the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry battle group, based in Edmonton, Alberta. "They will not
be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Army Col. Frank Wiercinski, standing in front of a Canadian flag
flying at half-staff, said: "They are our comrades in arms. In the last
several months, we have lived together, we have fought together, and now
we will mourn together."</TE>
<TE>   The slain soldiers were identified as Sgt. Marc D. Leger, 29; Cpl.
Ainsworth Dyer, 25; and Pvts. Richard A. Green, 22, and Nathan Smith, 27.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, these men knew better than any of us the risks that they
would be facing," Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton told reporters
in Ottawa. "And they accepted them, like all members of the Canadian
forces, with courage, bravery and conviction."</TE>
<TE>   The F-16 pilot was not based in Kandahar, U.S. officials said, but was
part of a large contingent of reserve airmen stationed at bases
throughout Central Asia and ferrying cargo in from Europe and the Middle
East. His was apparently one of two F-16s flying in tandem on patrol just
before the bombing, Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty told reporters at the
American air base at Bagram, north of Kabul. He described the pilots as
experienced.</TE>
<TE>   "We do everything we can to mitigate risk," Hilferty said. "We are in
a very, very dangerous business. We play with stuff that kills people."</TE>
<TE>   The bombing occurred as the U.S. Joint Forces Command was conducting
testing in Gulfport, Miss., of a system designed to avoid friendly fire
by using sensors to distinguish allied from enemy fighters. The two-week
evaluation began Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The erroneous airstrike marked the third such incident of the war
confirmed by the Pentagon:</TE>
<TE>   * Five Americans and an untold number of Afghan soldiers were injured
amid an uprising of Taliban prisoners at a compound outside
Mazar-i-Sharif on Nov. 26 after a Navy F-18 used faulty coordinates to
target the site.</TE>
<TE>   * Three U.S. soldiers and an estimated 25 allied Afghans were killed

<HD>Annan Urges U.N. to Send Peacekeepers to West Bank</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary- general pushes the idea despite U.S. and
Israeli objections. Some American allies are giving it serious thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>Despite U.S. and Israeli opposition, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
urged the U.N. Security Council on Thursday to dispatch a large
multinational force to the West Bank to guard aid deliveries, provide
security during the rebuilding of devastated Palestinian areas and
monitor an eventual cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials have said they oppose the introduction of outside
forces as long as Israel objects--and Israeli officials here reiterated
their opposition Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For practical and political reasons, most council members acknowledge,
a Middle East peacekeeping force would require strong U.S. diplomatic
backing and probably logistical support. The U.S., with its veto power on
the council, retains control over any such decision.</LD>
<TE>   Yet Annan, described by aides as deeply disturbed by the council's
seeming inability to brake the violence--and emboldened by European and
Arab calls for direct international intervention in the region--decided
to press ahead with his proposal despite U.S. opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows he is going out on a limb with this," said a diplomat from a
European member of the Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the closest U.S. allies on the 15-member council--among them
Britain, Norway and Mexico--said they were giving Annan's idea serious
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   "We have just been presented with very, very substantial food for
thought," said a British diplomat after Annan addressed the council. "If
you are not going to do this, then you have to think hard about what the
other alternatives are."</TE>
<TE>   The widespread view among diplomats here is that Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell's just-completed mission to the Middle East, which failed
to achieve a cease-fire, and remarks by President Bush on Thursday
seemingly endorsing Israel's siege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
headquarters suggest that mediation efforts should not be left
exclusively to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   And none of the council members challenged Annan's contention Thursday
that the Israelis and Palestinians cannot be trusted on their own to
abide by a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Annan first proposed sending foreign troops into the Palestinian
territories while at U.N. offices in Geneva last week.</TE>
<TE>   He elaborated Thursday, saying that a multinational force should
supervise a cease-fire and an Israeli withdrawal to positions its army
held before the outbreak of the Palestinian rebellion in September 2000.
The peacekeepers should remain to impose order while rebuilding efforts
and political negotiations get underway, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Only a foreign force can be counted on to halt "the tragic and
terrifying descent into bloodletting that we have all been watching over
the past few months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned by the secretary-general, the force would not
necessarily require the prior approval of Israel, which has long opposed
the presence of foreign troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. "It is
time for the international community to pursue such an option in a
proactive way, rather than waiting for the parties to arrive at this
conclusion on their own," Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   The council should authorize the force under the collective
self-defense provisions of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, Annan said,
relying on "a coalition of the willing" to provide troops, as with the
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect the parties to cooperate with such a force and to
facilitate its deployment," he said. "It is in their interest to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel firmly objects to a deployment of such a force at this stage,
since it will only reward the Palestinian side and discourage it from
fighting terrorism," the government said in a statement issued here.</TE>
<TE>   Annan suggested that U.N.-backed peacekeepers might more effectively
deter terrorism than Israeli troops, who at times are targeted by
Palestinian militants. Israeli officials disagree, saying international
troops also would be exposed to terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although Annan declined later to estimate the optimal size of such a
force, he noted that in Bosnia-Herzegovina about 60,000 peacekeepers were
ultimately able to "pacify" a region also riven by explosive ethnic and
territorial disputes.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary-general's proposal gave fresh impetus to an Arab-backed
Security Council resolution endorsing a "third-party presence on the
ground"--a measure that was temporarily withdrawn while Powell was
visiting the region. Washington had vowed to veto the resolution,
objecting not just to the third-force plan but also to the Arabs' harsh
condemnation of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But European delegations are now consulting with their capitals to see
whether a substitute resolution might be offered endorsing the broad
outlines of the Annan proposal, even in the face of U.S. opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Among our questions are whether it is practical, whether it can
achieve its goals and whether the cooperation of all parties can be
attained," a European diplomat said.</TE>

<HD>Arab Leaders Lean on Bush to Bring About a Withdrawal</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Moderate states call for a harder push to end Israel's
West Bank incursion. Bush and Powell try to find a fresh approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush came under intense pressure from key Arab leaders to
prod Israel to end its West Bank military operation, as he huddled
Thursday with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to develop plans for a
fresh attempt at ending the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   In a friendly but blunt conversation, Jordan's King Abdullah II called
Bush on Thursday to emphasize that the turmoil caused by the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has reached the point where the stability of
moderate Arab countries is at risk, according to well-placed sources who
asked to remain anonymous.</LD>
<LD>   The official Jordanian news agency reported that the king, a staunch
U.S. ally, called on Bush to "take firm stances to make Israel
immediately withdraw its troops from all the Palestinian territories,
including the compound of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat."</LD>
<TE>   But the sources told The Times that the Jordanian leader also stressed
the dangers to his regime and other moderate governments in the region if
the incursion does not end soon.</TE>
<TE>   Through emissaries, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah also conveyed
concern about the administration's failure to win Israel's compliance
with U.S. and international demands for a speedy pullout from the West
Bank. Arab diplomats said the prince, who is scheduled to visit Bush's
Texas ranch next week, considered canceling the visit because of mounting
frustration with the Bush administration--a claim denied by a senior
administration official.</TE>
<TE>   The prince, who is the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom because
of King Fahd's health problems, will have some tough words for Bush
during the visit, a leading Arab envoy said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're way beyond angry," the envoy added, referring to the
prevailing Arab attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, in a bid to generate a sense of momentum to its peace
efforts, may dispatch Powell back to the region in two or three weeks,
administration sources said. And CIA Director George J. Tenet may go to
Israel as early as next week to work on restoring security cooperation
between the Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who returned from the Middle East this week after failing to
negotiate a cease-fire, is scheduled to spend Saturday with Bush at Camp
David working on strategy to push the new U.S. effort forward, White
House and State Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage acknowledged Thursday
that the Middle East crisis is causing the U.S. trouble in the Arab
world. "We are clearly, at least temporarily, losing some support," he
told a House Appropriations subcommittee. "We've got a problem."</TE>
<TE>   But the senior administration official, who requested anonymity,
stressed the need for patience and perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "If any American president had an idea as to how to resolve all this,
it would have been done by now," the official said. "We know this is a
long haul, that you don't solve a decades-old problem in one trip."</TE>
<TE>   Many sources willing to discuss the tense diplomatic situation
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither Israel nor the Palestinians complied with U.S.
proposals during Powell's mission, the White House is pleased with what
was achieved, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary went there with things exploding around him, literally,
and he managed to defuse the situation. We do have the parties at least
trying to respond to the responsibilities that were laid out for
them--whether an Israeli withdrawal or statement that the Palestinians
made" condemning terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Washington now expects Israel to withdraw from most Palestinian areas
of the West Bank by Sunday, U.S. officials and Israeli diplomats said.
Although Israel has pulled back from some areas, including Jenin, its
tanks and troops are still in several cities and towns. Troops also moved
into two villages Thursday on search-and-arrest raids, according to the
State Department.</TE>
<TE>   After Powell briefed Bush on Thursday, the president praised Israel
and said it had "met the timetable" set by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
for pulling out.</TE>
<TE>   "History will show that they responded," Bush said. Sharon "gave me a
timetable and he's met the timetable."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Bush had called on Israel to withdraw "without
delay."</TE>
<TE>   To facilitate the withdrawal, U.S. diplomats and intelligence
officials are trying to help mediate solutions to the standoffs at
Arafat's headquarters in the city of Ramallah and at Bethlehem's Church
of the Nativity. Israel says it will not end the blockades or withdraw
troops from either Palestinian city until militants at both sites wanted
in the assassination last fall of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi,
illegal arms shipments and other extremist acts are handed over.</TE>
<TE>   Said the senior administration official: "It's very complicated. We're
probing for answers with both sides." Some of the militants in Ramallah
are people the United States asked the Palestinian Authority to arrest
before Israel launched its incursion, the official added.</TE>
<TE>   Powell on Thursday called for Israel to accelerate the removal of its
tanks and troops because the military operation is "one of the
difficulties that we have now in moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   In Cairo for talks with Egyptian leaders, Assistant Secretary of State
William Burns said, "Obviously, the first step is to complete, urgently
and fully, the Israeli withdrawal from areas that have been recently
occupied."</TE>
<TE>   After their talks, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher added his
voice to the Arab chorus. "We want a firmer and harder American position
in the face of the Israeli aggression," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of growing congressional frustration, Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) on Thursday introduced a bill that would cut U.S. ties with
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe [Arafat] is not a leader who wants peace for his people,"
Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), would deny
visas to Arafat and top Palestinian officials, downgrade the status of
Palestinian diplomats in Washington and confiscate assets in the U.S. of
Arafat and other Palestinian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein and McConnell said they had no immediate plans to bring the
measure to a vote, although they expected to hold a hearing on it.</TE>
<TE>   House Republican leaders might schedule a vote as early as next week
on a nonbinding resolution condemning Arafat and the Palestinian
Authority and expressing support for Israel.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach shop owner Samera Sood is reluctant to discuss
politics with patrons of her Native American art store. So when a
customer recently noted her accent and asked where she was from, Sood
said simply that she was born near Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   Taking Sood for an Israeli, the customer said she was glad the
Palestinians were "getting what they deserved."</LD>
<LD>   Sood told the customer of the recent Israeli assault on the West Bank
town of Jenin and the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by
Israeli allies at refugee camps in Lebanon. History, she said, should not
be repeating itself. Jews, "of all people, should stand up," said Sood,
who is president of the Palestinian American Women's Assn. of Southern
California. "These are innocent lives."</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian Americans, who began immigrating to the United States more
than 100 years ago, have largely achieved the American dream. About
350,000 strong (give or take those who go back to Palestinian territories
each summer to renew their family ties and language skills), they are
middle-class professionals, many Christian, often Republican, who decry
the actions of the Sept. 11 terrorists as barbaric.</TE>
<TE>   But as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ended his peace mission this
week, some Palestinian Americans expressed deep dismay about the failure
of the Bush administration to engage early enough in Mideast diplomacy or
to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to stop what they see as
a massacre of their people.</TE>
<TE>   "People are being killed," Sood said. "Why is the world not saying
anything? Is their blood so cheap?"</TE>
<TE>   Like Sood, many Palestinian Americans are grieving because of the
sense that they have lost a connection. Arabs under Jewish rule, they
left Israel and the territories to escape a feeling of being second-class
citizens. They embraced freedom of speech and educational opportunities
in the United States, only to come to feel as though they are
second-class citizens again.</TE>
<TE>   "We came seeking freedom and dignity, and we found them in America,"
said Lily Karam, a Downey businesswoman. "Now I feel so lonely, as I did
when I was growing up over there. I love the American people, and
suddenly I feel so alienated."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the alienation, they said, stems from a conviction that the
Palestinian side of the story is rarely heard in the U.S., that there is
a double standard about the lives lost to violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The core problem for us as citizens of this country is this
disparity: Every effort by Palestinians to resist occupation is seen as
an act of terrorism and every effort by Israel is seen as self-defense,"
said Nahid Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   They are also angry that their tax dollars, in the form of U.S.
military aid to Israel, are helping finance the Apache attack helicopters
and M-16s used in the current Israeli offensive, which has resulted in
the deaths of relatives and the destruction of property.</TE>
<TE>   Samir Kassees, a retired high school instructor who now teaches
American government at Widener University in Chester, Pa., told Powell
during a meeting with community leaders April 3 that "we are allowing use
of our weapons and our tax moneys to destroy our own property."</TE>
<TE>   Kassees, a Korean War veteran who heads the American Federation of
Ramallah, Palestine, said he is incensed that Israel does not heed the
call of the U.S. government to end its military incursion. Palestinian
Americans see it as a snub and a fresh reminder of the impotence they
experienced under Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember going shopping with my grandfather in Ramallah. I was 16.
He was 72," said Michel Shehadeh, who heads the Southern California
office of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. "An Israeli
soldier at a roadblock asked my grandfather for his ID, dropped it on the
ground and kicked my grandfather when he reached to pick it up. My
grandfather got up and put his hand in front of me to stop me from doing
anything. I was so humiliated--for him, for me--that I cried for hours."</TE>
<TE>   In touch with relatives by e-mail and cell phone, Palestinian
Americans offer accounts of new humiliations at the hands of
Israelis--reports that bodies of civilians have been buried in hospital
parking lots, that Jenin has been flattened, that American citizens were
among those killed. They are trying to raise emergency funds for the
hospitals--suddenly overwhelmed with casualties--through the
Washington-based United Palestinian Appeal. The going is slow, fund
manager Makboula Yasin said.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Americans, both Jewish and Palestinian, Asad Salameh thinks
that the road to peace is clear: End Israeli settlements in Palestinian
areas; police the border, perhaps with U.N. observers; and learn to
coexist.</TE>
<TE>   "Fixing it is so easy I never give up on peace," said Salameh, who
owns a jewelry store in Sonoma, where the vineyards and olive trees
remind him of his early years in the West Bank. "Every Palestinian will
tell you the same thing. It may not be perfect, and there will be a lot
of enmity. People in Jenin have suffered a lot. The same with Israeli
citizens in Netanya. But the solution is very easy."</TE>
<TE>   Those interviewed do not think that Sharon is interested in peace, and
they worry that Israel continues to expand its settlements in the West
Bank even as the White House has called for a halt to military
operations.</TE>
<TE>   But Salameh says Israelis and Palestinians have much in common and
might someday make good neighbors. "Most Palestinians speak Hebrew very
well, and every Israeli knows all the Arabic swear words," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Karam, the Downey businesswoman, is living proof of the possibility of
coexistence. Her sister married a Jew, and the couple have two children.
The two families are close.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother-in-law said when they married that he was going to prove
to the world we can live together," she said. "We are one family."</TE>

<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>The United States is sending 2,700 more troops to the Philippines
for a joint military exercise, nearly three months after a smaller U.S.
force was dispatched for a controversial counterterrorism training
mission.</LD>
<LD>   The three-week joint military exercise with 2,900 Philippine soldiers
begins Sunday and is intended to help the Southeast Asian nation improve
its defenses and ability to participate in U.N. peacekeeping missions,
the Philippine military said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The latest batch of troops comes on the heels of a 660-strong American
military contingent, which began arriving in the southern Philippines in
January to train Philippine soldiers to fight against a Muslim militant
group believed to be linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<TE>   The military exercise will be held on the main island of Luzon, in the
north of the archipelago, far from the ongoing six-month training mission
in the south, where the Abu Sayyaf group has been holding an American
couple and a Philippine nurse for more than 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said the latest exercise is similar in scale to
others conducted in the Philippines in recent years, and was planned
before Sept. 11. The 2,700 troops will withdraw after the exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a counterterrorism exercise," a Pentagon spokesman said.
"It is not in any way related to what's going on in the south," he said,
referring to the campaign against the Abu Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   Daily protests in Manila accompanied the start of the maneuvers in the
south. The Philippine Constitution limits the activities of foreign
troops, but the Supreme Court struck down a legal challenge.</TE>

<HD>Putin Says Future's Bleak, and Bureaucrats Are to Blame</HD>
<DH>Russia: In state of nation speech, president stresses the need for
economic growth and tries to distance himself from government's failures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>By most indicators, life in Russia is better than it has been at
any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago. But that's
not what President Vladimir V. Putin told citizens Thursday in his annual
state of the nation address.</LD>
<LD>   Putin painted a bleak picture of his nation's future: too-slow growth,
too-stiff international competition, too many poor people. And few
friends willing to ease Russia's way into the global economy.</LD>
<LD>   "No one is going to war with us. No one wants this, and no one needs
this," Putin said. "But no one is really waiting for us either. No one
will go out of their way to help us. We have to fight on our own to find
our economic 'place in the sun.' "</LD>
<TE>   Economists agree with Putin's dismal assessment, saying that what good
fortune Russia does enjoy is more a matter of luck than policy. His
analysis was not new or remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   But Putin took the unusual step of seeking to distance himself from
his own government's failures. And to do so, he resorted to an old trick
from Russia's political playbook: the "good czar, bad boyars" routine.
Problems aren't the leader's fault. They are the fault of the
officials--in medieval times, the unruly nobles known as boyars; in
contemporary Russia, bureaucrats and administrators--who fail to carry
out his orders.</TE>
<TE>   "We are used to complaining about Russian bureaucracy, about its size
and slowness. And our complaints are entirely justified," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Economic growth is one of Putin's oldest themes, which he articulated
even as prime minister before rising to the presidency more than two
years ago with the resignation of Boris N. Yeltsin. At the time, Putin
stressed that "normal" rates of economic growth would be too slow to pull
Russia out of its backward economic state. Extraordinary rates--in the
double digits--were necessary.</TE>
<TE>Election in Two Years</TE>
<TE>   Two years from now, Putin will be facing reelection. And while
economic growth has been positive, and even topped 8% in 2000, it has
since lost momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Sergei A. Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, said Putin's
problem is not so much setting goals as finding ways to reach them.</TE>
<TE>   "Putin has entered a new phase of his tenure as president," Markov
said. "Before, he had to work on what he inherited from Yeltsin. . . .
Now he has entered a zone of not-so-obvious decisions. Now his team is
not so united on the course of further reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Putin has finally picked out the main objective: to ensure economic
growth," he added. "But he hasn't yet managed to work out a way to
realize this goal. And that is why he didn't feel quite comfortable
presenting this address today."</TE>
<TE>   Implicitly, the president's speech acknowledged a second failure.
Since he came to power, Putin has made a big effort to centralize power
in Moscow and has largely succeeded. But Thursday, he began to talk about
devolving responsibility back to local and regional authorities. Taken
together with his criticism of the bureaucracy, Putin's speech suggested
that the centralization moves did not accomplish what he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Vyacheslav A. Nikonov, a political analyst with the Politika
Foundation, a think tank in Moscow, pointed out that Putin's difficulties
embody an age-old Russian irony: the leader's power is absolute, but
surprisingly ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that the address was written in compliance with the
old Russian pattern--where a good czar criticizes bad boyars," Nikonov
said. "It has never been otherwise in this country. Russia has a czarist
political culture, where the czar is not part of any branches of power
and rules from the very top."</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, Putin appeared uninspired by his own message, rushing
through some sections so quickly that he stumbled over his words.</TE>
<TE>   He showed little emotion. An exception was when he discussed the
separatist republic of Chechnya, a subject that often raises his hackles.
Putin praised the "courage and heroism" of the Russian forces that have
fought there for the last 31 months, and he said the next task was to
ensure the full rights of citizenship to Chechens.</TE>
<TE>   "The military stage of the conflict can be considered completed,"
Putin said.</TE>
<TE>   But as if to belie his words, at least 18 elite Interior Ministry
police died Thursday morning when a truck and a bus struck mines buried
in a dirt road near their headquarters in Chechnya. The police were local
Chechens who had been trained and outfitted as part of Russia's effort to
turn security in the republic over to local pro-Moscow forces. When other
officers arrived at the scene, gunmen fired on them from nearby
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was the deadliest in the republic since last summer, and it
followed a similar mine attack that killed six Russian servicemen
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign policy got only a cursory mention 40 minutes into the
50-minute speech, when Putin referred to the war on terrorism in
I-told-you-so tones. "It was precisely Russia's steadfast principles that
permitted the anti-terrorism coalition to form," Putin said.</TE>
<TE>   "For our country, which long ago encountered terrorism, there was no
question that we would support the use of force to destroy its 'lair,' "
he added.</TE>
<TE>A European Orientation</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that Russia's foreign policy will remain "pragmatic" and
oriented toward Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is actively integrating itself into the world community, and
in spite of the stiff competition to which I have already referred, it is
particularly important for our country to be able to find allies and
itself to be a reliable ally of others," Putin said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the predominance of domestic policy in the speech and a
sprinkling of populist promises such as raising pensions and lowering
utility rates, some observers said Putin's real audience seemed to be
foreigners, with his emphasis on the need for economic and legal reforms
long demanded by foreign governments and investors.</TE>
<TE>   "The country has not heard anything as cheerless as this in years,"
said Communist Party leader Gennady A. Zyuganov. "Even Putin's ardent
supporters did not applaud once during the speech."</TE>

<HD>6 Killed as Train Derails in Florida</HD>
<DH>Accident: More than 60 people are injured, many trapped in the
wreckage of an Amtrak line carrying 468 passengers and crew on a popular
vacation run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>An Amtrak train popular with vacationers to Disney World and other
Florida theme parks shot off the tracks Thursday north of Orlando,
killing at least six passengers, injuring more than 60 and trapping
scores in a jumble of overturned cars, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The Virginia-bound train was carrying 468 passengers and crew members,
Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said. Fourteen of its 16 passenger cars
derailed, seven flipping onto their sides.</LD>
<LD>   Police, firefighters and fellow passengers were atop the overturned
cars into the evening, helping those still trapped to get out.</LD>
<TE>   "We just started hurtling and left the track, and the next thing we
knew we were bouncing off the walls," said Bernie Morgan, who was
traveling from Naples, Fla., to Doylestown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   David Sheldon, 71, who was traveling with his wife from Boca Raton,
Fla., said it took about 30 seconds for the train to come to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly you could feel the brakes scraping," he said. "It seemed
like forever."</TE>
<TE>   The derailment occurred at 5:08 p.m. EDT in wooded terrain near
Crescent City in Putnam County, about 60 miles north of Orlando,
according to Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   Train No. 52, commonly known as the Auto Train, carries passengers and
their cars, vans and motorcycles between the Orlando suburb of Sanford
and Lorton, Va., outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The only one of its kind in the United States, the train is a popular
means of transportation for families visiting central Florida's tourist
attractions and Atlantic beaches, and for snowbirds from the Northeast
who spend the winter in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Television news helicopters showed the gleaming silver cars, some of
which came to rest at right angles to the tracks. Though many passengers
took part in the rescue effort, others sat quietly, perhaps in shock,
atop the overturned cars.</TE>
<TE>   "In 30 years of law enforcement, I've never seen anything like this.
It's like Matchbox cars; they're just thrown around," Volusia County
Sheriff Ben Johnson told reporters after surveying the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Putnam County authorities sent every available emergency vehicle to
the accident scene, and law enforcement agencies from elsewhere in
north-central Florida contributed helicopters, fire engines and
ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   About 75 people were trapped at one point in one of the overturned
cars, said Chris Doyle of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Rescue workers used ladders to scale the derailed cars and hoisted up
backboards to carry the injured.</TE>
<TE>   People heard screams for help coming from inside, according to local
reports. Rescue workers painted orange Cs--short for "cleared"--on the
derailed cars after they were cleared of people.</TE>
<TE>   School buses were pressed into service to carry passengers away.</TE>
<TE>   By Thursday evening, Lt. Bill Leeper, spokesman for the Florida
Highway Patrol, said at least six people were confirmed dead. More than
60 people suffered injuries of various degrees, including a person who
was taken by helicopter to a Gainesville hospital and was listed in
critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Greg
Martin said the agency was sending investigators to the scene. There was
no immediate word as to the cause of the derailment, but in a television
interview, former NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett said a spell of hot weather
might have warped the rails.</TE>
<TE>   The tracks are owned and maintained by CSX Corp., and a spokeswoman
for the company said they had been inspected about eight hours before the
derailment and found to be in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Train had two engines, 16 passenger cars and 23 automobile
transport cars. Preliminary reports indicated that seven of the transport
cars also derailed, though they remained upright, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Amtrak, the Auto Train is one of its most popular and
successful services, and it carried 234,000 passengers in 2000. This
year, a congressionally created panel reported that Amtrak, the nation's
passenger rail line organized with public and private ownership, made
money in 2000 only in the Northeast and on the Auto Train's 855-mile

<HD>Nev. Governor Faces Long Odds to Block Yucca Nuclear Dump</HD>
<DH>Profile: Guinn, fighting his biggest battle, says the key issue is
safety. No alternative exists, Energy chief tells a House panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>For all the arcane debate surrounding the use of Yucca Mountain as
the nation's nuclear waste repository, Gov. Kenny Guinn says the argument
should be all about the children.</LD>
<LD>   "We owe it to our children and their children to demand that the
government follow the law and guarantee that a dump site in Nevada won't
become a health hazard," said Guinn, who is fighting the biggest battle
of his political career.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Republican governor vetoed President Bush's selection
of Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, as a $60-billion
burial ground for spent nuclear fuel rods. On Thursday, Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham told a committee of the House, which is widely expected
to support the administration, that there is no alternative to Yucca
Mountain.</LD>
<TE>   To block the project, Guinn needs about 15 more votes in the Senate.
He knows the odds are against him, but Guinn grew up as an underdog and
forged a successful career that belied his childhood.</TE>
<TE>   The man who would become a teacher, a school superintendent, a
university president and governor, with child welfare issues consistently
topping his agenda, is the son of illiterate fruit pickers who migrated
from Arkansas to the small Central California town of Exeter.</TE>
<TE>   Like his parents, he picked grapes, plums and peaches in the fields on
the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. "Kids like me--Arkies and Okies--were
told we wouldn't be going to college, so we should take auto mechanics
and agriculture classes," Guinn said. "And I said, wait a minute, I am
going to go to college."</TE>
<TE>   His career moved swiftly, from a teacher in Visalia, Calif., to a
long-range planner for Las Vegas' school district. Within five years, he
was the district superintendent. "I wanted to end up in a position where
I could help children," said Guinn, who is married and has two grown
sons. "Education is how children overcome adversity."</TE>
<TE>   Guinn left the district and plied his financial and management skills
as the head of a bank and a gas utility company. While chairman of
Southwest Gas Co., he agreed to serve a year as interim president of the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas, which was polarized by a debate over
athletic versus academic priorities. Guinn, by now a wealthy businessman,
kept $1 of his salary and donated the rest to scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, Guinn expanded the state's Medicaid system to provide
health benefits to 25,500 children, compared with the 1,700 children
served previously, and he earmarked proceeds from the state's tobacco
settlement to fund college scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for its casinos and sex trade, Nevada is the fastest
growing state in the country. From 1990 to 2001, its population has grown
by 72.5%, to 2.1 million, including many young families with school-age
children seeking jobs and affordable places to live.</TE>
<TE>   A political novice, Guinn was promoted by the local political
machinery as an ideal gubernatorial candidate because of his civic
involvement. He amassed the biggest campaign war chest in the state's
history, and in 1998 easily defeated then-Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones to
become Nevada's first Republican governor in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere I've been . . . I've set priorities and implemented
long-range planning," said Guinn, 65. "I felt I still had a lot to give
and the right background. What I'm doing now isn't that different from
what I've done all my life."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dina Titus, who heads the state Senate's Democratic caucus, "It's
hard to be critical of Kenny because everything he does is so
middle-of-the-road. He hasn't made any big mistakes. In his heart, he
wants to always do the right thing. He should have been a Democrat."</TE>
<TE>   A former topless dancer and an attorney who lost election as a justice
of the peace are the only ones challenging Guinn's plans to occupy the
governor's mansion for another four years.</TE>
<TE>   Jones says she will vote for Guinn but chides him for not aggressively
pursuing state tax reform. Nevada does not tax personal or business
income, and the state is facing a significant budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "He has spent an inordinate amount of time researching and educating
himself on potential budget deficits, yet has been somewhat restricted by
his political handlers in taking a strong leadership role, which I think
he would enjoy," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Guinn convened a committee of civic and business leaders to
explore new state revenue sources. Where others say Guinn was playing it
politically safe by dodging new-tax issues during his first term, Guinn
said he would rather launch tax legislation formed by consensus than
propose his own. "I don't think a governor has the right to say I think I
know what's best for you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But these days, he's telling his president to walk away from Yucca
Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Guinn said Nevada has already made patriotic sacrifices for the
country, when 100 atomic bombs were detonated above ground in the state
from 1951 to 1963. Hundreds of people were killed nationwide and
thousands were sickened by radiation poisoning despite government
assurances that the tests were safe.</TE>
<TE>   Because of so many unanswered questions about the safety of Yucca
Mountain, Guinn said, the government still isn't trustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   He took his case to Washington last week to generate more publicity.
Leaving hardball lobbying to Nevada's two senators, Guinn met with only
one undecided senator, Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't make any commitment," Bond said later. "But he did
a very good job in tailoring his presentation for me. As a salesman, he
was one of the much better ones."</TE>
<TE>   Among those applauding Guinn's anti-Yucca efforts is former Nevada
Gov. Robert List, who grew up with Guinn in Exeter. List, a Guinn
political ally, recently has been chided by Nevadans because he signed up
with the Nuclear Energy Institute to promote the potential economic
benefits of storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of the fight he's putting up," List said. "When it comes to
anything that could threaten a state in any way, it's a governor's first
job to protect the people and environment from even the smallest threat,
and that's exactly what he's doing."</TE>

<HD>House Votes to Permanently Keep Tax Cuts</HD>
<DH>Politics: The measure passes largely on party lines. Democrats in
the Senate are expected to stall the GOP effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A divided House on Thursday renewed last year's battle over
President Bush's 10-year tax cut plan, as Republican leaders pushed
through a bill that would make the law permanent.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved on a 229-to-198 vote that closely tracked party
lines, would drop the current Dec. 31, 2010, expiration date for the
$1.35-trillion package of tax cuts.</LD>
<LD>   But the bill is expected to stall in the Senate, where Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) has said he will not bring it to a vote.</LD>
<TE>   Bush quickly praised the House's action and sought to apply pressure
on the Senate. "Taxpayers need to know they can count on continued lower
tax rates as they plan and invest for the future. I urge the Senate to
act on this measure, because failure to do so would penalize every
American who pays federal income taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's House debate was marked by rhetoric likely to echo
throughout this year's congressional campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans sought to portray Democrats as obstacles to the agenda of
a popular president and said opposition to making the tax cut permanent
was tantamount to supporting an enormous tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't take this action, in 10 years we will see the largest tax
increase in our nation's history," said Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats responded that extending the tax cut would threaten the
Social Security system because federal revenue would be drained just as
large numbers of baby boomers begin to retire.</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) called Thursday's
roll call "the definitive vote in this Congress on the future stability
and security of Social Security."</TE>
<TE>   The bill returned the spotlight to Bush's biggest legislative
achievement but under circumstances vastly different from when the tax
cut was enacted last spring. At that time, the federal budget was awash
in surplus revenue, the economy was beginning to stall and New York's
World Trade Center was still standing. Now the budget is running a
deficit, the economy is struggling to emerge from a recession and the
government is spending billions in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   While leading Democrats argue that those changes call for caution
about extending the tax cut, they have been wary of proposing a repeal or
rollback of any part of the current law.</TE>
<TE>   The law provided most taxpayers with rebates ranging from $300 to $600
last year, but many of its cuts will take effect gradually in the next
few years and then abruptly end. These provisions include reductions of
income tax rates, a doubling of the $500-per-child tax credit for
families, a new tax deduction for college tuition and repeal of the
estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   The law's sunset provision was included for accounting and political
reasons. Without it, the cost would have exceeded the $1.35-trillion
target negotiators had set and, because of congressional budget rules,
would have required 60 votes to pass in the 100-member Senate. It
ultimately passed, 58 to 33.</TE>
<TE>   Because some elements phase out before 2010, congressional analysts
say that making the tax cut permanent would cost about $373 billion from
2002 to 2012. No official cost estimate is available for the following 10
years, but Democratic analysts predicted that extending the tax cut would
drain about $4 trillion in revenue from 2013 to 2023.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats who supported the Bush tax cut last year say tighter
budgetary circumstances now give them pause. Although 28 House Democrats
voted for the tax cut last year, only nine voted Thursday to make it
permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Mike Ross (D-Ark.) said: "This is a vote that should happen in 10
years. But not now, unless we can demonstrate the money will not come
from raiding the Social Security trust fund."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans said the bill would not harm the Social Security program
and accused Democrats of demagoguery for raising the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing himself to taxpayers, Rep. William M. Thomas
(R-Bakersfield) said: "What they are using is scare tactics . . . to make
sure you don't get some of your hard-earned dollars."</TE>
<TE>   The California delegation split along party lines with one exception:
Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) voted for the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The issue may come before the Senate, despite the opposition of
Daschle and other top Democrats. Senate Republicans tried to force a vote
Thursday on making repeal of the estate tax permanent.</TE>
<TE>   The effort was deflected with a procedural move, but Republicans
pledge to keep trying.</TE>

<LD>A 22-year-old British woman living in Florida is believed to have a
brain-destroying illness linked to "mad cow" disease, the first known
case in the United States, health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The woman is believed to have caught the fatal disease by eating beef
in Britain at the height of that country's cattle epidemic, said Dr.
Steve Ostroff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health
officials wouldn't give the woman's whereabouts or her condition.</LD>
<LD>   Officials in Tallahassee said that there is no reason to suspect
cattle in the United States have the disease, known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE. They also said there is no risk to Americans from
the human case.</LD>

<LD>   He had no clue it was the car that turned him in.</LD>
<LD>   The late-model sedan he was driving was the Arlington County Police

steal it.</LD>
<TE>   When the car called police, a map of Arlington flashed on a computer

<LD>A former aide to Illinois Gov. George Ryan who worked on his
campaign while collecting a state salary pleaded guilty to fraud and was
cooperating with prosecutors in a wider corruption probe.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Juliano, 35, entered his guilty plea in U.S. District Court in
Chicago to one count of mail fraud. He could be sentenced to up to 2 1/2
years in prison, depending on his level of cooperation in the prosecution
of Ryan's campaign and its top manager on corruption and racketeering
charges, federal prosecutors said.</LD>

<HD>Tapes From Flight 93 Prove Heroic Acts, Relatives Say</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Unprecedented listening session inspires pride and anger.
Family members say federal officials asked them not to reveal specific
details.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRINCETON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>With pride, sadness and anger, families of the passengers and crew
of United Airlines Flight 93 listened Thursday to a tape of the hijacked
plane's last moments, confirming their belief that their loved ones
fought to the finish.</LD>
<LD>   Some emerged saying they had recognized their relatives' voices amid
the bedlam that ended the 31-minute cockpit voice recorder tape. The
passengers are believed to have prevented a second hijacked plane from
crashing into a Washington-area landmark on Sept. 11 by rushing the
cockpit.</LD>
<LD>   "These were clearly people who were informed of the unthinkable . . .
digested it and acted on it," said Hamilton Peterson, a Washington lawyer
whose father, Donald A. Peterson, was killed. "I think it is a message to
the world that the American spirit is alive and well. . . . The heroics
are manifest."</LD>
<TE>   Martha Burnett O'Brien and Mary Jurgens said they heard their
brother's voice. Bay Area businessman Tom Burnett is believed to have
been an organizer of the passenger revolt.</TE>
<TE>   Her recognition "is based on 38 years of knowing him," O'Brien said.
"My sister and I both straightened up when we heard that voice, and we
looked at each other and mouthed, 'That was Tom.' That's what we did. It
was good to hear his voice."</TE>
<TE>   She did not reveal what he said. Other family members said federal
authorities asked them not to divulge details of the recording.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 relatives of the 40 passengers and crew members listened
in somber silence inside a red brick hotel complex on a warm spring day.
(Four hijackers also were aboard the flight.)</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the tape were hard to follow, family members said after the
four-hour session.</TE>
<TE>   An aircraft noise like the wind rushing made it difficult to hear. But
there were clear sounds of a battle at the end: dishes crashing in the
passenger cabin and distinctly American voices rising over the commotion.</TE>
<TE>   The flight from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco had taken off 40
minutes late on Sept. 11, moments before the first attack on New York.
After the plane was hijacked over Ohio, passengers called their relatives
on cell phones and learned the World Trade Center had been hit by
hijacked aircraft. Flight 93 had turned around to the east and was
heading for Washington when it crashed in a Pennsylvania field.</TE>
<TE>   "Those 31 minutes do record some heroic actions on the part of our
loved ones," said Alice Hoglan of Los Gatos, whose son Mark Bingham is
believed to have taken part in the passenger revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "I am extremely proud that Mark Bingham was able to stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with his fellow passengers and fight against these
terrorists. It was really powerful, excruciating and disturbing to listen
to, but beautiful at the same time. I'm very proud. Very proud."</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors and FBI agents interviewed family members, seeking
to bolster their case against Zacarias Moussaoui, who is believed to have
been training to become the fifth member of the squad that hijacked
Flight 93. Moussaoui is charged with conspiring to kill more than 3,000
people in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to screw that case up--we want to nail" Moussaoui, said
Tom Burnett Sr., a teacher from Minnesota and father of passenger Tom
Burnett. "I was angry on Sept. 11, and I've been angry ever since. When I
hear that [tape], it makes me angrier."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the government is
reaching out to the families and wants to "include them in the process of
justice." Ashcroft had no comment on the contents of the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department victim assistance specialists were present at the
Marriott hotel, as well as volunteer grief counselors, medical personnel
and clergy. The tape was played in a ballroom off-limits to all but the
families and others cleared by the government. FBI agents guarded the
corridors and entrances.</TE>
<TE>   Some relatives came to the hotel to talk to prosecutors and the FBI
but did not stay to hear the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials opened the session by saying they expect
jury selection in the Moussaoui trial to begin in September and a trial
the following month, family members said. A transcript projected on a
large screen helped the families follow the recording.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien said portions of the tape were very clear, and the transcript
enabled her to pinpoint events. Jurgens, her sister, said the passengers'
struggle with the hijackers sounded like "this is war."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Britton, a Lutheran minister from Long Island, came to
memorialize his sister Marion, a U.S. census manager from New York. "She
loved a good story, and she loved a good meal," he said, speaking before
the tape was played.</TE>
<TE>   Britton recalled how his sister had taken care of their elderly
parents while he was assigned to a congregation in another state. He said
Marion had many stories about that time that he will never have the
chance to hear. "I am going to tell [the FBI] how I lost a piece of my
memory," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is another piece of completion," Britton added, "but I don't look
for any comfort out of this day."</TE>

<LD>Mob killer Salvatore "Sammy the Bull" Gravano told a federal judge
in New York City that he wants to keep his lawyer in his drug case, even
though she's a criminal defendant herself.</LD>
<LD>   Government prosecutors had argued the attorney, Lynne Stewart, should
be barred from the case to protect Gravano's interests. Stewart, 62, was
indicted last week in an alleged conspiracy to relay messages from
another imprisoned client, blind cleric Omar Abdel-Rahman, to his radical
followers.</LD>
<LD>   Asked by a federal judge whether he wanted Stewart to continue working
on his case, Gravano answered, "Yes."</LD>
<TE>   Stewart had said she was willing to stay on the case, but it was
Gravano's decision.</TE>

<HD>Peril of Aging Shuttles Told to Congress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>There's danger ahead for space shuttle astronauts unless Congress
pays for long-term upgrades to the aging spaceship fleet, a NASA safety
expert said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never been as concerned for space shuttle safety as I am right
now," said Richard D. Blomberg, former chairman of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's aerospace safety advisory panel.</LD>
<LD>   The next flight, and perhaps many after that, will be safe, he told
the House Science subcommittee on space and aeronautics. But unless
Congress provides money to adequately upgrade the shuttle fleet now, he
said, "nobody will know for sure when the safety margin has been eroded
too far."</LD>
<TE>   Other officials disagreed, saying the shuttles receive regular
upgrades and have a long life span left.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never take off unsafe," said Frederick D. Gregory, associate
administrator of the Office of Space Flight.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Blomberg said Congress needs to catch up to the threat
that age poses to the 21-year-old program.</TE>
<TE>   Their comments came as shuttle Atlantis' astronauts aimed for a
homecoming in Florida today after completing one of the most complex
construction jobs ever at the international space station.</TE>
<TE>   Good weather was forecast for the touchdown at Cape Canaveral.</TE>
<TE>   The seven astronauts installed a 44-foot girder at the orbiting
outpost. It is the first segment of an aluminum frame that eventually
will stretch 356 feet, have railroad tracks spanning the entire length,
and support four sets of solar wings.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttles are growing older and need new parts and technologies. So
is the launching equipment, built almost 40 years ago at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida. Also, as the first generation of shuttle
personnel retire, hiring freezes and other cutbacks could prevent that
institutional and technical knowledge from being retained, Blomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress decides how much money to grant NASA next year and how the
agency should spend it, lawmakers are growing frustrated with internal
institutional debates over the shuttle's future, whether it should be
upgraded, replaced or both, and whether to contract out some of its
services.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like the agency is without a clear vision and without a clear
direction," said Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.).</TE>

<HD>Massive Protests in Capital to Spotlight Eclectic Causes</HD>
<DH>Activists: Tens of thousands are expected to target such disparate
issues as the war on terrorism, monetary talks and the Mideast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of activists are expected to take to the streets
in Washington this weekend in what organizers are calling an
"extravaganza" of protests expected to culminate in the largest street
demonstration here since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The causes are sweeping and eclectic, with groups rallying against the
war on terrorism, in opposition to International Monetary Fund and World
Bank meetings, against U.S. policy in Colombia and for Palestinian
solidarity.</LD>
<LD>   "Never have there been more things we need to protest!" reads one of
the Web sites offering a schedule of events, which range from teach-ins
to an anarchist soccer match to a joint march on the Capitol scheduled
for Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The largest of the factions is expected to be the student-organized
antiwar march, likely to be the most public U.S. display to date opposing
President Bush's anti-terrorism campaign. Also expected on the streets
are supporters of the anti-terrorism effort.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the pro-Palestinian contingent, which will take its
argument to the site of the annual conference of the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby. Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon had been scheduled to speak at the conference early
next week but canceled because of the West Bank conflict.</TE>
<TE>Too Many Causes May Blur Messages</TE>
<TE>   Brought together by coincidence and design, the groups have worked
side by side to shape events. Still, the disparate causes have led to
concerns by some that the individual messages will be lost.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting Wednesday night, anti-globalization activists practiced
getting out clear messages in manageable sound bites.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what the issues are: The cost of having the debt is too
high," said Njoki Njoroge Njehu, director of the group 50 Years Is
Enough. "Bear in mind what our demands are and people can hear us even if
they say we don't know why we are here."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Eidinger, a spokesman for Mobilization for Global Justice, said
it is significant for social justice groups to come together.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement is like a muscle," he said. "If you don't flex it every
once in while, it gets weak."</TE>
<TE>   The planned protests--some with police permits, others without--have
local law enforcement on high alert. Starting Saturday, the entire
3,600-member Washington police force will be put on active 12-hour
shifts. Their numbers will be bolstered by other area law-enforcement
officers, and National Guard troops will be on standby.</TE>
<TE>Gearing Up for Any Terrorist Threat</TE>
<TE>   Already this week, Washington police have contended with tens of
thousands of pro-Israel demonstrators at a rally on Capitol Hill, as well
as a march--revived after a 100-year hiatus--commemorating the
emancipation of the slaves.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has changed since 9/11," said police spokesman Joe
Gentile, adding that police anticipate anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000
protesters. "You have to take that into account because you'd be a fool
not to. We have to concern ourselves with the possibility that a
terrorist could work his way into the crowd or attack the crowd. That's
the new reality."</TE>
<TE>   Gentile said organizers who have met with police have vowed to be
"peaceful, although not necessarily lawful." A proposed parade route that
would have taken anti-globalization demonstrators by several corporate
offices was denied this week. Nonetheless, protesters vowed to march past
the offices of Coca-Cola, Monsanto and Occidental Petroleum to put on
street theater with giant puppets--with or without police permission.
These demonstrators are in town for this weekend's IMF and World Bank
meetings, which have become magnets worldwide for disruptive street
protests.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, police clad in riot gear prevented massive crowds from
shutting down the IMF and World Bank meetings here, arresting nearly
1,300 and putting on a show of force designed to prevent a repeat of
violent demonstrations in Seattle the previous year. Local police had
geared up again last September for a planned massive demonstration that
was canceled in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks. That
protest, backed by organized labor and environmental groups, had been
expected to exceed the tens of thousands that managed to shut down the
Seattle meetings.</TE>
<TE>   But the mainstream groups that added volume and credibility to those
protests are electing to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Thea Lee, assistant director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, said
this weekend's planned demonstrations lack the clarity and focus required
for labor to become involved, particularly given the large antiwar
presence.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you go to the trouble of organizing a big street protest,
you hope to gain support for the actions you are organizing around," Lee
said. "If at any time you are going to be alienating as many people as
you are intriguing, it's a problem."</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of labor and environmental groups instead issued a report
this week calling for greater transparency in World Bank decision-making,
deeper debt relief and assurances that worker rights and environmental
protections will be upheld--the same demands that protesters plan to make
on the streets Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Actor Grew Even More Reclusive After Wife's Killing</HD>
<DH>Behavior: He moved to daughter's home in a gated neighborhood,
nearly vanishing from sight.</DH>

<LD>In an effort to flee the unwanted spotlight cast on him for the
past year, actor Robert Blake abandoned his longtime cozy Studio City
neighborhood and many of his old haunts and habits.</LD>
<LD>   His scruffy, dark wood house on Dilling Street was painted and put on
the market last fall at $1.098 million, and the title he had bestowed
upon the house in painted block letters--Mata Hari Ranch--was excised.</LD>
<LD>   He may be gone from the neighborhood but his namesake dish is not. At
Vitello's, the old-school Italian restaurant that he frequented--and
where he ate the night his wife was killed--there is still a spinach and
pasta dish that bears his name on the menu. "We don't take it off [the
menu] unless people don't buy it," said owner Joe Restivo.</LD>
<TE>   When Blake left Studio City, he moved with his infant daughter to the
home of his grown daughter, Delinah, 35, who lives in Hidden Hills, in
the far west San Fernando Valley. It is a private enclave of 540
million-dollar-plus homes, a gated community guarded by armed security
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, was always a bit of a recluse--an aging celebrity who had
invested well enough to live comfortably without working. But since his
wife's death, the friends with whom he occasionally had breakfast and
listened to music found that he had nearly vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not seen him or heard from him in the last year since all this
happened," trumpeter and comic Jack Sheldon, 70, said in a phone
interview as he sat, stunned, watching the television images of his
friend being arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon used to count on seeing Blake in jazz clubs when he played.</TE>
<TE>   "I always liked Bobby. He was always really good to me. He loved the
jazz."</TE>
<TE>   Blake was at a now-defunct Burbank club called Chadney's four years
ago, listening to Sheldon play, when he met his future wife Bonny Lee
Bakley, according to several accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even notice her," Sheldon said.</TE>
<TE>   When Sheldon tried to call him shortly after Bakley's slaying last
May, Blake's phone number had been changed.</TE>
<TE>   Sheldon and Blake's other entertainment industry friends have been
left to speculate among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone will say, 'You think he did it?' And I'll say, 'I don't think
he did.' I don't think he could do it," said Sheldon.</TE>
<TE>   As before his wife's killing, Blake surfaced at Playboy Mansion
parties.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty sure I've seen him once or twice," said Bill Farley,
communications director for Playboy Enterprises. "He stayed in the
background and was pretty quiet."</TE>
<TE>   But Farley added that Blake had always been a low-key presence at
those parties of 400-some people.</TE>
<TE>   In Hidden Hills, fellow residents said they seldom saw Blake, although
some glimpsed him jogging occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, they said, had acted peculiarly: he would often stop and ask
passersby how far he had run.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Said Michael Small, 15, whose home is a few blocks from Blake's,
living near the celebrity the last few months was "almost like having
O.J. living next to you."</TE>

<HD>Senate Votes to Tighten Rules of U.S. Entry for Foreigners</HD>
<DH>Security: Students in particular would be more closely monitored in
a bill expected to be approved by the House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate overwhelmingly approved measures Thursday to enhance
U.S. border security, including new rules for monitoring foreign
students, more effective use of intelligence data and 2,000 extra
immigration investigators and border inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, promoted as a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, passed by a vote of 97 to 0.</LD>
<LD>   The House, which has passed a similar bill, is expected to approve the
Senate legislation this week and send it to the White House for President
Bush's signature.</LD>
<TE>   Advocates said that the legislation, projected to cost more than $3
billion over three years, would improve the nation's security without
compromising freedoms or endangering the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to last year's USA Patriot Act, which gave the administration
sweeping new powers to prosecute suspected terrorists, the Border
Security Act is a narrower set of measures designed to strengthen
America's traditionally relaxed entry system.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it would lift the 45-minute time limit for U.S.
inspectors to process incoming flights, a requirement that had placed the
convenience of air travelers ahead of methodical inspections at U.S.
ports of entry.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of the main co-sponsors,
described the legislation earlier this week as "the most important bill
the Senate can pass to fix what is a very broken system."</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite its broad support, the bill had bogged down in the Senate,
where Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) complained that it was being pushed
with inadequate scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a provision was omitted at Byrd's insistence that would
have temporarily allowed immigrants who have overstayed their visas to
apply for U.S. residency while still inside this country, rather than
returning home to submit such requests.</TE>
<TE>   The provision, known as 245(i), is ardently supported by immigrant
rights advocates and had been included in the House version of the border
security bill. Byrd and other critics had assailed it as an inappropriate
concession to illegal immigrants and a provision that could be exploited
by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd voted for the bill Thursday while still questioning the cost
estimates and noting that the provisions would still need to go through
the appropriation process. Proponents of the bill said that the new INS
and border personnel would be added gradually, over a five-year period,
and that much of the funding had already been approved.</TE>
<TE>   The bill requires that the visas and passports used by foreign
travelers to this country contain unique personal data, such as
fingerprints, and be made with modern, tamper-resistant technology to
foil counterfeiters.</TE>
<TE>   It would require schools in the U.S. to notify the Immigration and
Naturalization Service if a foreign student fails to report for class
within 30 days of the registration deadline.</TE>
<TE>   And it mandates that the Bush administration introduce an intelligence
data system in which the INS and the State Department, which issues
visas, would have better access to information on terrorists held by such
agencies as the CIA and FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "Today the Senate approved landmark legislation to improve our border
security and fix a visa-entry system shown to be inefficient,
inadequately enforced and riddled with loopholes that have allowed
suspected terrorists to enter the United States with little difficulty,"
said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), a main co-sponsor along with Feinstein,
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sam Brownback (R-Kan.).</TE>
<TE>   "With passage of this comprehensive and bipartisan measure," Kyl
added, "we can finally report to the American people that Congress has
acted to make it tougher for terrorists to enter this country and do them
harm."</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the bill enjoyed 61 co-sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would largely prohibit U.S. authorities from issuing
visas to nationals from countries that have been classified as sponsors
of terrorism. In addition, it would improve training of the Border Patrol
and customs agents and mandate U.S. consulates to have active
terrorist-lookout committees.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, State Department officials maintained that they had
received little intelligence or law enforcement information about any of
the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the legislation would call on the administration to
create an "interoperable" law enforcement and intelligence data system,
providing those who administer visas and those who guard U.S. borders
with more timely information on people to watch out for.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking for a needle in a hayfield, so we have to have this
information-sharing," Brownback said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the 30-day requirement for schools to notify the INS if
a foreign student does not show up, the bill would require the Justice
Department to notify schools that a student had entered the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would mandate that the INS regularly check on whether
schools are following the reporting requirement; schools that fail to
comply could lose their authority to accept foreign students.</TE>
<TE>   The student measures were relatively noncontroversial, compared to
earlier calls for a hiatus in admitting foreign students or proposals for
new restrictions on what foreigners may study after they have entered the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that these provisions strike an appropriate balance
between whatever tightening of the controls may be needed as a result of
Sept. 11 while also keeping our country open to foreign students," said
Vic Johnson, an official of an association of international educators
known as NAFSA.</TE>

<HD>Congress to Seek Attack Contingency Funds</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) wants Congress to provide
$100 million this year so lawmakers could meet if the Capitol were to be
attacked by terrorists, House Appropriations Committee Chairman C.W.
"Bill" Young said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Young, a Florida Republican, and several House aides would not provide
details of how the money would be spent. A Senate aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said it would help prepare a place for the House
to conduct business in case the Capitol were rendered unusable. The money
probably would go for such items as telephones, computers and voting
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   House and Senate leaders have intensified contingency planning since
the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and the Pentagon and the Oct. 15 receipt
of an anthrax-laden letter by aides to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.). Both chambers have designated secret locations in the
Washington area where they would meet if the Capitol were devastated or
could not be used for a period of time.</LD>
<TE>   The Capitol was evacuated the morning of Sept. 11, but lawmakers
resumed meeting there the following day. When the anthrax letter was
received, Congress ended its week early and the Capitol was closed so it
could be checked and given a precautionary cleaning. Some of Congress'
separate office buildings were closed for weeks or months for
decontamination.</TE>
<TE>   Young said Hastert asked him to attach the money to an emergency
$27.1-billion measure that President Bush has requested for
anti-terrorism and other programs. Two aides said the money would be
included in a classified section of the bill, for which details will not
be publicized.</TE>
<TE>   A Democratic aide said the request probably would get bipartisan
support.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Keeps Open Deportation Hearings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected the Justice
Department's effort to keep closed deportation hearings of individuals
targeted in the sweeping terrorism probe launched after the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati rebuffed the
government's request for an emergency stay of a U.S. district judge's
April 3 ruling that the government's policy of closing such hearings is
unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit Court said there was only a
"slim likelihood" that the government would prevail in its appeal of the
decision by Judge Nancy G. Edmunds in Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   The appellate judges--Martha C. Daughtrey, Karen N. Moore and R. Guy
Cole Jr.--also said that it was "unlikely" that the government would
suffer "irreparable harm" by complying with Edmunds' order pending its
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In the first ruling by a federal judge on the closed hearings, Edmunds
said the government must open deportation hearings in the case of Rabih
Haddad, a Lebanese native who is a longtime resident of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
and the founder of an Islamic charity that the government has been
investigating since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Edmunds also ordered the government to release transcripts of prior
hearings held in the case. She acted in response to a suit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union's immigrant rights project on behalf of
several plaintiffs, including U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and
the Detroit Free Press.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that the government alleges substantial injuries to the
integrity of its terrorism-related investigation, but the likelihood of
such harms occurring in this particular case is remote, given the fact
that information about Haddad's detention has already been disseminated,"
the 6th Circuit judges said. They were referring to widespread media
coverage of Haddad's arrest Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt applauded the ruling. "I think it's
significant that the court was simply unwilling to accept the
government's assertion that the sky would fall in if there was no stay
pending appeal. The court made it clear that the harm asserted by the
government was speculative and not supported by concrete evidence,"
Gelernt said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development Thursday, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft issued a
regulation forbidding non-federal authorities from releasing information
about immigration detainees held in state and local facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The move was an apparent attempt to override a ruling by a New Jersey
state court that granted the ACLU access to records of detainees held in
Hudson and Passaic counties. Hundreds of Arab Americans have been taken
into custody in New Jersey since the attacks and held in two jails that
have a contract with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey laws dating to 1898 mandate that the names and dates of
entry of all inmates in county jails "shall be open to public
inspection," without exception. However, the government had kept the
names of the New Jersey detainees confidential.</TE>
<TE>   On March 27, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Arthur D'Italia ordered
that the names be made public. He spurned the contention of James S.
Reynolds, chief of the Justice Department's Terrorism and Violent Crimes
Section, that disclosure of the names would jeopardize the continuing
investigation into terrorist activities. He also rejected the
government's contention that disclosure would violate the inmates'
privacy rights. The judge cited a 1969 decision of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia that described secret arrests as
a "concept odious to democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "With due respect to the government, nothing is easier for the
government to assert than that the disclosure of the arrest of X may
interfere with the ongoing investigation of Y," D'Italia said. The judge
granted the government a stay pending appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey, said the
Justice Department's action Thursday shows it is "seeking to codify the
right to secretly arrest and detain anyone they want in open defiance of
the courts." The Justice Department did not return a call seeking
comment.</TE>

<HD>ACLU Suit Claims Texas Inmate Raped, Sold as Slave for Months</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Texas prison officials were sued Thursday for allegedly allowing a
33-year-old gay black inmate to be raped and sold among prison gangs for
$5 as a slave.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in U.S.
District Court in Wichita Falls, Texas, claims that as prison gang
members traded Roderick Johnson "as a chattel," sexually assaulted him
and forced him to clean inmates' cells, guards chided him for not
protecting himself.</LD>
<LD>   ACLU attorney Margaret Winter said that Johnson had complained to
prison officials for 18 months to no avail and that authorities moved him
into protective custody this month only after the ACLU intervened.
Johnson, a sailor, is serving a 10-year term at the James V. Allred Unit
in Iowa Park for violating parole terms from a home burglary and cocaine
conviction.</LD>
<TE>   "Texas prison officials think black men can't be victims and believe
gay men always want sex, so they threw our client to the wolves," Winter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,
said that an investigation was launched before Thursday's lawsuit and
that "we run a clean, efficient, state-of-the-art prison."</TE>

<DL>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>More than 2,000 Marines dispatched to Afghanistan last fall to help
hunt down terrorists returned Thursday to American shores, storming the
beach in the finest tradition of the Corps.</LD>
<LD>   The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit was the first military unit to
leave the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks. The unit seized the
Kandahar airport, reopened the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, searched caves and
helped build a prison for enemy prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   In February, the unit handed over security of southern Afghanistan to
the Army.</LD>
<TE>   "People who say American kids aren't tough haven't seen these guys,"
said Lt. Col. Jerome Lynes, battalion commander of the Marine unit's
infantry battalion.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Marines returned by crashing the base's Onslow Beach in
landing craft from their ships--the Bataan and the Whidbey Island. They
were then brought to their barracks aboard buses.</TE>
<TE>   Families and girlfriends waved welcome signs and American flags as the
buses pulled up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like winning $1 million," said a tearful Lisa Hart, wife of
Sgt. Derek Hart, after their first hug. "We're going to go home and lock
the doors, make food and watch movies. I'm going to pamper him. Whatever
he wants, he gets."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's homecoming marked the first time Sgt. Justin Baker of
Holland, N.Y., had seen his 2-month-old baby girl.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain it," Baker said after picking up the infant. "The
feeling was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Savannah, Ga., soldiers of the 1st Ranger Battalion
joined the families of their three fallen comrades for a memorial
service.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Bradley S. Crose, Spc. Marc A. Anderson and Cpl. Matthew A.
Commons were killed March 4 in Afghanistan while trying to save a Navy
SEAL.</TE>
<TE>   More than 600 Army Rangers in dress uniform, along with the parents,
siblings and grandparents of the dead, filled the pews.</TE>
<TE>   The three Rangers' helmets, rifles and combat boots stood like
makeshift crosses at the altar. A silence was followed by a salute of
gunfire from outside the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Savannah.</TE>
<TE>   They had been stationed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. Funerals
were held in March, but a memorial was delayed until their comrades
returned home.</TE>

<LD>INS and Qantas--A story in the April 6 California section
incorrectly stated that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
notified Qantas Airlines a week in advance that 17 Chinese passengers
lacking proper paperwork to enter the United States might be arriving on
a flight to Los Angeles International Airport. The INS says it was
mistaken and that the airline was actually notified only one day in
advance, on April 2. Qantas denies wrongdoing in the case and is fighting
a proposed federal fine of $56,100.</LD>
