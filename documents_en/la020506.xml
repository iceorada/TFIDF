<HD>Director Tweaks 'Unfaithful' Ending</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Early preview audiences for the erotic drama "Unfaithful," starring
Diane Lane and Richard Gere, saw a slightly different ending than the
one that will debut in theaters on Wednesday in Los Angeles (and
Friday nationwide). Without giving anything away, the new ending is
more ambiguous than the original version.</LD>
<LD>   Why the last-minute change of heart? "The ending now is the one
that [screenwriter] Alvin Sargent originally wrote, and I thought it
would be more interesting and provoke more discussion," says the
film's director, Adrian Lyne.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Lyne changed the ending of one of his movies was on
another erotic tale about adultery, the smash hit "Fatal Attraction"
(1987), and that was in response to preview audiences' reaction. In
the original, the Glenn Close character commits suicide, implicating
the adulterous Michael Douglas. Lyne re-shot it, providing a more
"operatic" revenge-style finale. Both endings are now available on
the new DVD of "Fatal Attraction." "Some people like the original
ending. I always thought it was a bit flat," Lyne says.</LD>
<TE>   In "Unfaithful," a 20th Century Fox film, Lane plays a suburban
housewife whose marriage to husband Gere is imperiled when she has a
torrid affair with a French bookseller (Olivier Martinez).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Fatal Attraction," the altered ending for "Unfaithful" was
not based on test audience input. "It was just a hunch," says Lyne.
Based on "anecdotal" reaction, Lyne is confident he's made the right
choice. Though the altered conclusion is not likely to engender as
much controversy as "Fatal Attraction," Lyne says, "I think it will
cause more debate. It treats the audience like adults, and I've found
that it's always dangerous to underestimate the public."</TE>

<LD>Elton John once said that pop music is supposed to be disposable, and
nothing exemplifies this side of pop better than the one-hit wonder.
VH1 takes a long, mostly lighthearted look at this phenomenon in a
five-part series, "100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders," which can be seen
nightly at 10 this week, starting tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Host William Shatner is the guide through 20 songs each night,
working his way from No. 100, Carl Douglas' 1973 single "Kung Fu
Fighting," up through No. 1, Los Del Rio's once-ubiquitous 1996 hit
"Macarena."</LD>
<LD>   The cable channel isn't keeping the list secret--it's posted on
the VH1 Web site, www.vh1.com, along with audio samples of each of
the top 20 honorees and a trivia contest. There's also a section in
which fans can vote on current songs they think will most likely wind
up as the one-hit wonders of the future.</LD>
<TE>   "This is one of my personal favorites" of VH1's semi-annual '100
Greatest ... ' shows," says Steve Tao, VH1 senior vice president of
programming and production, who's also executive producer of the
program. "We're not making fun of things.... These are songs we all
love, which for some reason or other stuck in the consciousness of
the nation. One thing we decided early on is that we would make it a
celebration of these songs and this kind of music."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the entries are exactly the kind of throwaway hits John
probably had in mind when he spoke of disposable pop: Taco's 1983
single "Puttin' on the Ritz" (No. 79), Falco's 1986 song "Rock Me
Amadeus" (No. 44) and Chumbawumba's "Tubthumping" from 1997 (No. 23).</TE>
<TE>   Others may surprise viewers, among them Sinead O'Connor's version
of Prince's "Nothing Compares 2 U" (No. 18) or the Sugarhill Gang's
influential "Rapper's Delight" (No. 16).</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting to see that some of these artists, many of whom
are icons of rock 'n' roll, had only one single chart hit," Tao says.</TE>
<TE>   In view of VH1's core audience--people ages 25 to 40--the entries
not surprisingly skew heavily toward music from the '80s and '90s.
About 20% of the songs were hits in the '70s, and just three date to
the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Songs and their positions were chosen by Tao and other members of
VH1's editorial staff, who considered not only each recording's chart
position but also, Tao says, "how indelibly marked it became in
society, and whether it transcended music to be known in other
arenas."</TE>
<TE>   So the fact that former Vice President Al Gore once attempted to
dance the Macarena contributed mightily toward cementing its spot at
the top of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   Tao says viewers shouldn't take the list too seriously. Just sit
back and, as the title of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's No. 41 entry
puts it, "Relax."</TE>

<HD>A Battle-Scarred Veteran Spills His Guts About Hollywood
Wars</HD>
<DH>Books* Producer Art Linson writes that this is no town for
a mogul clinging to fading glory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his tome about groveling through Hollywood, producer Art Linson
summons what is a truly scary sight to those who habitually dine at
the Grill and Barney Greengrass, the power joints du jour. This is
"Jerry," a ghost of moguls past, a man--actually a composite of men
Linson has known--who once ruled Hollywood, now exiled to the outer
realms of Malibu, a man Linson terms as the past "president of the
Hollywood Venality Club."</LD>
<LD>   In the new book "What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from
the Front Line," it's Jerry's job to needle Linson, the producer of
such films as "The Untouchables" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"
about his slow slide from glory.</LD>
<LD>   "After ten minutes with Jerry, I couldn't avoid reflecting on my
own Hollywood mortality," writes Linson. "Let's face it, time was
running out.... For me producing hit movies had become an
increasingly farfetched affair. And in this town, where 'new' is
best, I could feel the black hole of Hollywood purgatory waiting for
me."</LD>
<TE>   "What Just Happened" presents the Hollywood producer as a Willy
Loman-like schlepper, hustling to make one more movie, before
irrelevance sets in. Released this month by Bloomsbury, it's a breezy
anatomy of ritual humiliation, Hollywood-style.</TE>
<TE>   Before too many tears set in, however, it's best to remember that
Linson stills lives in a beautiful, multimillion-dollar Craftsman
house in the choicest section of Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his spare, wood-lined home study, the 60-year-old
producer-turned-writer is wearing faded black jeans and a black
shirt, and manages to be both gruff and unexpectedly puckish.</TE>
<TE>   He explains that "Jerry" is a riff on the Sidney Sheinbergs and
Jon Peterses of the world, "the executive who once had power and no
longer has power, and this is how he deals with his loss of power.
He's forced to either abandon himself completely from Hollywood,
which no one seems to be able to deal with, or find a way to try to
get his seat again, or stand on the sideline and talk about how he
doesn't care about ever having his seat again, but seems to know
about everything that's going on."</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry" serves as a sadistic father confessor to "a producer who's
still desperately trying to hold on--which was me," Linson reports.
"That's what led me to want to do the book. My intentions are really
to say 'OK, this is how it feels. This is what it feels like when you
run into Mike Ovitz. This is what it feels like when you want to make
a movie one way and, afterwards, who you hired has a different take
on what he thinks he should be doing, and you're trying to reconcile
it.</TE>
<TE>   "And the conflicts are fantastic. Frankly, I didn't try to make an
explosive book, but almost everything that happens in Hollywood has a
certain incendiary quality to it and everybody gets bent out of shape
so easily here that I mean, if you talk about an agent who wore the
wrong striped tie to dinner, it's unforgivable."</TE>
<TE>   A Feeding Frenzy of Insider Tell-Alls</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Julia Phillips' memoir, "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This
Town Again," landed on bestseller lists in 1991, a veritable flotilla
of Hollywood players and would-be players have deemed themselves
important enough to churn out their memoirs, with varying degrees of
insight and truthfulness, from Lynda Obst to Mike Medavoy, Sumner
Redstone and Harry Knowles.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many, Linson is actually an amusing writer, and he even
wrote the book himself. While Phillips ladled out her Hollywood dish
with invective, Linson is more of an absurdist, focusing on the
dashed expectations involved with making such intelligent but not
particularly commercial fare as "Fight Club" (1999) and "Great
Expectations" (1998) (from which one swift Fox executive tried to nix
Gwyneth Paltrow because she has "no chin").</TE>
<TE>   As a producer, Linson concentrated on making a number of movies
about macho men engaged in varying forms of mano-a-mano combat, from
"The Untouchables" (1987) to "Heat" (1995) and "The Edge" (1997). In
his own life, he's a keen anthropologist of Hollywood one-upmanship,
a decoder of the strange dances of power between studios and
producers, agents and stars.</TE>
<TE>   Describing Tom Rothman, the co-chairman of Fox, he writes: "Our
first encounter was chilly. He talked. I listened. He conducted the
entire meeting with his back to me while he was organizing some
papers behind his computer. I suppose he was either showing me that
he could do more than one thing at a time or else he was saying,
'Since I couldn't make a go of it as a producer, [don't bother]
trying.'"</TE>
<TE>   He describes the Creative Artists Agency headquarters in Beverly
Hills as a "hideous marble and glass mausoleum ... designed to
punish. So sweaty was its need to express power, it inadvertently
overwhelms the visitor. The lobby witlessly screams 'We're big, we're
significant, we're indestructible ... you're not.'"</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't even stint on himself, noting "a producer bursting with
confidence can be a truly ugly sight."</TE>
<TE>   Linson tells of a long and hilarious battle to get Alec Baldwin to
shave his beard for "The Edge," and trying to nail down Robert De
Niro for that same film, among a variety of other projects.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Edge," a photographer and the older husband of a fashion
model have to fend off each other as well as the wilderness in which
they are stranded. Their adventures include being attacked by a bear.</TE>
<TE>   De Niro--a friend of Linson's--deflected the enticement by
suggesting that the bear have sex with the photographer: "That might
be interesting."</TE>
<TE>   In the world not judged by Hollywood's thin-skinned standards,
Linson takes not quite potshots, but humorous nibbles at Hollywood's
culture of self-importance. Moreover, some fairly notable friends
such as David Mamet (who is said to have modeled the rapacious
producer in "Speed the Plow" after Linson) and "Panic Room" director
David Fincher, with whom Linson now has a company, escape unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Linson has dabbled as a director (on the little-seen "The Wild
Life") and written one other book, "A Pound of Flesh," about the nuts
and bolts of what producers actually do.</TE>
<TE>   He explains: "I always wanted to write. The problem is, selfishly,
I didn't want to take a cut in pay. You just do a lot better as a
movie producer."</TE>
<TE>   Giving Credit Where</TE>
<TE>   Credit Is Due</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many producers, Linson is careful not to posture as the
film's auteur.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to find a producer or executive who doesn't say, 'I
made this movie,' and producers don't make movies and executives
don't make movies and very few of them are qualified to make movies,
but you need to be thought of as a creative guy. They forget what
their role is. They're basically smart money managers. But they have
an attitude about an actor or performance, [an edit] or an ending,
and they start to get involved. And that's where the waters get muddy
and the dissension starts out and that's why you hear directors
screaming, 'I have to have final cut. I don't care if I get paid.'"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Linson, who's now clocking over 25 years in the business,
has a simple remedy for curing one of Hollywood's worst ills: Take
all the executives, producers and agents, and every two years, "like
a graduate course, they should go make a 3-to-5-minute film of their
kid's birthday, or some dinner they had, or some vacation they had
with their wife, cut it together, put some music on, and we all get
to go to the Directors Guild, everybody in Hollywood, to look at
their piece of work. It would give them a different attitude toward
the people that make this stuff, because it's so easy to tell a
director what they think should be done, when you've never done it."</TE>
<TE>   In a town obsessed with success, it takes some pluck to write a
book documenting your career growing cold. Linson takes to the task
with gleeful insouciance and charm.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I've [told] bitter Hollywood tales, but I'm not actually
bitter. I think there's something very compelling about Hollywood,"
says Linson, who adds, "I candy-coated every scene. It's actually
much worse."</TE>

<HD>The Force Is Still With Her</HD>
<DH>Alanis Morissette performs with her typical intensity,
effectively delving into the raw emotions of love and pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alanis Morissette certainly likes to ask questions as a songwriter.
Remember how she first caught our attention in the spiteful 1995 hit,
"You Oughta Know," by asking a former lover whether he thinks of her
when he's making love (not exactly the term she used) to another
woman?</LD>
<LD>   In the opening track on her latest album, the Canadian
singer-songwriter may well set a North American record for the number
of questions in a single song. In "21 Things I Want in a Lover," she
asks prospective suitors everything from whether they "derive joy
when someone else succeeds" to if they are uninhibited in bed.</LD>
<LD>   So, it only seemed fitting that we posed our own question during
Morissette's concert Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre: Does this
27-year-old still rank as one of pop's most commanding figures
despite the creative misfires in her latest album?</LD>
<TE>   The answer was fast and convincing in her 90-minute performance.</TE>
<TE>   Morissette and a spectacular five-piece band, driven by drummer
Blair Sinta, played with energy and force. Their sheer intensity made
the weaker songs in "Under Rug Swept" seem less marginal and the
intensity lifted the better songs from this and earlier albums to an
even higher level.</TE>
<TE>   Whether joining the band on electric guitar or simply prowling the
stage with the microphone in hand, Morissette has evolved into a
striking performer who conveys the often raw emotions of her songs
with the authority of a correspondent coming back from the
battlefield. The dispatches deal chiefly with the struggle against
troubled relationships, disillusionment and low self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   She's not a concise writer, often allowing the lyrics to come
across as a laundry list of complaints and/or conflicting images. But
when Morissette hits a groove, she shows why she helped break down
the commercial pop barriers in the '90s that had long tended to force
female singer-songwriters into a secondary role.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do the images in such songs as "Uninvited," "Thank U" and
"That Particular Time" feel fresh and alluring, but the songs'
melodies, too, have a soaring, graceful quality.</TE>
<TE>   As a singer, Morissette can be shrill, which leads to complaints
that she's whiny. Generally, however, she matches the purity of the
music with a style that is at once passionate and conversational,
making it easy to sing along.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk about her being a malcontent, there is an
underlying optimism and faith in her music that offers the
reassurance that we can find strength from life's most difficult
encounters.</TE>
<TE>   The main question you might have asked of opening act Ryan Adams
was whether that was really him on stage. Adams is a marvelous
songwriter who is equally effective as a rock 'n' roller or in the
more sensitive singer-songwriter mode.</TE>
<TE>   Because he normally does two-hour shows, he chose to emphasize
only his "bad boy" rock 'n' roll side in the limited, hourlong set
Friday. To add to the rebellious aura, he played in virtual darkness.</TE>
<TE>   For someone who is into his music, it was a good-natured bit of
rock rebellion, but for those who were new to Adams, they must have
wondered what the heck was going on. Regardless, the music itself,
including "Rescue Me" and "Nobody Girl," offered up rootsy, Rolling
Stones-type rock with invigorating tenacity. When he mixes the
sensitive side in the two-hour set, however, he is an even more
invaluable young talent.</TE>

<HD>McCartney: A Lot More Than Nostalgia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get the most accurate sense of a concert's worth, it's normally
wise to discount about 25% of a fan's enthusiastic report in the days
after the show. They are, after all, fans, and besides, they don't
want you to think they wasted their money.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how much co-workers rave over the water cooler today
about Paul McCartney's concert Saturday at Staples Center, however,
you should add 25%.</LD>
<LD>   It's far easier to underestimate McCartney's level of
accomplishment in this triumphant tour, his first in nine years, than
to overstate it.</LD>
<TE>   That's because it's easy to assume that the warm, uplifting tone
of the 21/2-hour concert was inevitable given the massive affection
for everything Beatles, 32 years after the quartet broke up.</TE>
<TE>   How hard can it be, many may ask, to wow a crowd when you have
"Hey Jude," "Yesterday" and all those other McCartney hits in your
set list?</TE>
<TE>   There's also the trap of writing off the impact of the show to
simple nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   Everything that happened on stage Saturday was certainly enhanced
for the mostly over-40 crowd by the memories associated with the
songs--and the fact that this could be the last time around for
McCartney, who rarely tours and will be 60 next month.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, all that fan devotion and immense expectation
level could be too heavy a weight, one that could amplify any concert
misstep. McCartney could have gone wrong in any of several ways,
including spending too much time on new material or wrapping the
Beatles and Wings tunes together in a careless way that felt
predictable and uncaring.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, the audience could have been disheartened by an
obvious decline in McCartney's vocal skills. Stars as great as Frank
Sinatra and Elvis Presley suffered through that humiliation in their
later years.</TE>
<TE>   McCartney avoided all the potential problems. He may have
forgotten lyrics in a couple of places and told a few corny jokes,
but he was a stylish, gracious host who seemed respectful of the
Beatles' legacy and the audience's role as part of that extended
family.</TE>
<TE>   Following the same song list that he used in the tour's April 1
opening in Oakland, McCartney stepped away from the Beatles/Wings
catalog only five times--including for the Oscar-nominated "Vanilla
Sky" and the underwhelming Sept.11 tribute number, "Freedom."</TE>
<TE>   The evening, thus, was a virtual feast of priceless memories.</TE>
<TE>   He played the expected hits, including "Let It Be" and "Band on
the Run," as well as some tasty side numbers, including the socially
conscious "Blackbird," and high-energy ones such as "Back in the
USSR" and "Jet."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his own tasteful bass, acoustic guitar and keyboard work,
McCartney's four-piece band ( Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums, Wix Wickens
on keyboards, and Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray on guitars) played
with razor-sharp execution.</TE>
<TE>   Most commanding were McCartney's vocals, which retain an everyman,
crooner charm on ballads such as "My Love" as well as a raw intensity
on "Maybe I'm Amazed" and "I Saw Her Standing There."</TE>
<TE>   The most uplifting feature of the tour, which included a stop
Sunday at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, is its warmth--and nothing
captured that more Saturday than two companion moments.</TE>
<TE>   As McCartney went into the 1964 hit, "All My Loving," early in the
set, the images on the video screens above the stage took us back to
the innocence of the famous Beatles airport arrival scenes from the
'60s. We see mobs of shrieking teenage girls, one holding a sign, "We
Love You, Never Leave Us."</TE>
<TE>   It's an especially poignant moment, given the deaths of two of the
Beatles, John Lennon in 1980 and George Harrison last year, as well
as the 1998 death of McCartney's wife, Linda.</TE>
<TE>   (As in Oakland, McCartney, who with drummer Ringo Starr, is the
only surviving member of the band, dedicated songs to both Lennon and
Harrison, "Here Today" and "Something," respectively, during a
40-minute acoustic section. He later played "My Love" for Linda.)</TE>
<TE>   Some two hours later, McCartney employed the video screens to show
the much older, but emotional Staples crowd, including L.A.'s
omnipresent celebrity-fan Jack Nicholson, as Saturday's fans sang
along on "Hey Jude."</TE>
<TE>   It was an inspired touch that could serve as a perfect bookend to
the earlier airport scene in a family photo album--as well as an
endearing symbol of the emotional intensity of the evening.</TE>

<DH>Clora Bryant's musical odyssey will hit another high note
when she receives an award Friday from the Kennedy Center in
Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phone is ringing, the intercom is squawking and the stereo is
booming, but Clora Bryant moves serenely about her Crenshaw district
apartment like a woman in the eye of a whirlwind. She is preparing
for a trip to Washington, where on Friday her "supreme trumpet
mastery" and lifetime contributions to jazz will be recognized by the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with its Mary Lou
Williams Women in Jazz Festival Award for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "I was sitting at my boombox working on my book," says Bryant,
recalling the moment she learned she would join the venerable
sorority of jazz musicians, which includes Shirley Scott, Marian
McPartland and local legends Vi Redd and Melba Liston, as the seventh
recipient of the festival's titular award.</LD>
<LD>   "It was my old friend [pianist and Kennedy Center artistic advisor
for jazz] Billy Taylor on the phone. He told me they were going to
honor me this year and I just whooped and dooped," remembers Bryant.
"The Kennedy Center? For little ol' me from Texas? A female
trumpetiste? It was almost like the first time I played with Louis
Armstrong. I got goose bumps. I'm getting goose bumps right now. You
see, I'm a very goose-bumpy person."</LD>
<TE>   Goose bumps, hot-licks, spotlights and deep deep blues seem to
punctuate the length and breadth of Bryant's 59-year career. "People
don't know what you've been through," she says, pausing a moment to
reflect. "They don't know the road you've traveled. I had to fight to
keep from making the agents and the [casting] couch my source of
employment. Y'see, my mother died when I was 3 and so my dad raised
me and my two brothers, Fred and Mel. I really emphasize that about
my father because that was during the '30s, during the Depression,
and they wanted to put us in an orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   "My father only made $7 a week and he had a tough row to hoe. He
had always taught me to carry myself as a lady. But when I first
decided I was going to play the trumpet he said, 'You know, it's
going to be a challenge. Are you up to it?' I had already made up my
mind that it was going to be my life. And he said, 'If you're going
to play in this man's world, I'm behind you.' And when he said that,
I knew I could do anything. He taught me to be aggressive, assertive,
persistent, consistent. He was strong--my knight in shining armor."</TE>
<TE>   The virtues that Charles Bryant inculcated in his daughter proved
to be decisive. They helped her survive a racially proscribed and
harrowing childhood that saw her father beaten and literally
railroaded out of Texas by racists, her family broken apart, and
Bryant exposed to the wiles of predatory kinfolk.</TE>
<TE>   In 1941, big brother Fred went to war and 14-year-old Clora
inherited the old trumpet he never got around to mastering. Music
became her only refuge and she practiced day and night. "I'd close
the door to my room and music was my world," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As a teen, her talent was spotted and nurtured by Conrad Johnson,
a noted music teacher who had mentored Hubert Laws, Joe Sample and
many other promising young Texas musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "He took me under his wing," Bryant says. "His thing was feelings.
Like most of the elder statesmen of jazz, that's what he
emphasized--feelings, not just notes like they do today. Because the
white man--and I don't mind saying this--is so busy trying to take
our music and put it into a classical bag. But jazz is not
classical," she says emphatically, spelling it out. "It's
c-l-a-s-s-i-c.</TE>
<TE>   "Classic!"</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s there were many female singers and some pianists,
like Mary Lou Williams, who were accepted, but the thought of a woman
competing on equal terms with men playing any other instrument was
considered nothing but a novelty. Nevertheless, as a 16-year-old,
Bryant's talents won her full scholarships to the Oberlin
Conservatory in Ohio, as well as to Bennett College in Greensboro,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   She opted to remain in Texas and join the Co-Eds, a 16-piece,
all-girl orchestra that made its home on the campus of Prairie View
College. Bryant patterned her trumpet style after her idols, Louis
Armstrong and his successor, the fiery and sensuous Roy Eldridge, a
swing era trumpeter who formed the crucial link between Armstrong and
the emerging young iconoclasts like John Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie who
were harbingers of the brash modern sound in jazz.</TE>
<TE>   The Co-Eds toured extensively in the South and Northeast and
backed the hot Negro swing and jump blues artists of the day. In
1945, Bryant left Prairie View to be reunited with her father and
brother Mel, who had found work in California.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here in January of 1945," Bryant recalls. "I wanted to go
to school, and back in Prairie View they told me about USC and UCLA.
They said that USC was a little prejudiced, so I opted for UCLA and
they accepted me.</TE>
<TE>   "But I found out that they were just as prejudiced," she asserts.
"There weren't many [African Americans] out there, so the teachers
would get funky. You'd report them to the counselor and they'd be on
the side of the teachers; but I endured it. I dropped out after a
year because I had to go to work."</TE>
<TE>   For an African American musician in the 1940s, "work" meant
Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I began playing with groups on the avenue, and that's where I got
my comeuppance," Bryant says.</TE>
<TE>   She accepted every challenge, performing alongside the most
formidable young players on the block: Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray,
Frank Morgan, Carl Perkins, Hampton Hawes, Art and Addison Farmer,
Teddy Edwards, Sonny Criss et al. She also backed up jazz divas such
as Josephine Baker and Billie Holiday. In 1956--the year before she
recorded her first LP as a leader, "Gal With a Horn"--she met the
artist who would exert the most important influence on her life and
playing.</TE>
<TE>   The Beginning of a</TE>
<TE>   Lifelong Friendship</TE>
<TE>   "I was as hot as a female could be here in Los Angeles," Bryant
recalls. "[Trombone player] Melba Liston was with Dizzy's band and
they were playing at a place out in Hollywood and I went to the club
to see them. I was sitting between Sweets Edison and Charlie Barnet,
and Dizzy's up there playing. Quincy Jones and Lee Morgan and all
these big cats were in the band. I didn't know it, but Melba had told
Dizzy about me. When intermission came he came over to the bar where
I was sitting and said, 'Hi Clora,' and he kissed me on my forehead.
I didn't wash it for a week after that."</TE>
<TE>   The two trumpet players never became intimate, but from that
moment, they were lifelong friends. Bryant, along with Gillespie's
widow, Lorraine, was instrumental in getting the hugely influential
trumpeter a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is the mother of four, the grandmother of nine, and this
month expects to be a great-grandmother for the second time. Over the
years, she has toured the world, performing throughout Canada, Europe
and Australia, as well as in the former Soviet Union in 1989, at the
invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev. Bryant has been awarded three
National Endowment for the Arts grants for her work as a composer and
has taught jazz history at USC, UCLA and Pasadena and Santa Monica
city colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1980, she has been working on her autobiography,
"Trumpetistically Speaking, Love, Clora Bryant." A documentary based
on Bryant's life by UC San Diego professor Zeinabu Irene Davis is
also in development. And the self-styled "trumpetiste" was an editor
for "Central Avenue Sounds," Steven Isoardi's landmark survey of jazz
history in South L.A.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1996, Bryant underwent quadruple bypass surgery. Not even
that dampened her spirit or slowed her down. "I was in the hospital
for five days, but when I came home I had a party and danced all
night. My kids said, 'Mom, you'd better sit down.' And I said, 'No,
I'm glad I'm living and I'm going to dance.'"</TE>
<TE>   But the road traveled by Bryant, who turns 75 on May 30, has been
tough. "L.A. does not recognize its own," she laments. "They didn't
recognize that I was the only female to get up there on the jam
session with Dexter and all those people. I'm the only female horn
player that played with Charlie Parker," she says, recalling how she
met the jazz master in the '50s.</TE>
<TE>   "Max Roach was playing at the Lighthouse with Howard Rumsey,"
Bryant says. "I was playing in a place right next door called the
High Seas. Charlie had been in 'Frisco with Diz and Stan Kenton's
group and had come down to see Max Roach at the Lighthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a Sunday afternoon, and everyone tried to get Charlie to
play with Max and the group, but he wouldn't do it. He just wanted to
hear Max. He knew me because he was friends" with her then-husband,
bassist Joe Stone. "When he found out that I was next door he came in
there and went up to the bandstand and asked if he could borrow a
tenor. I almost wet my pants.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a blues tune, 'Now's the Time.' Charlie took that tenor
and played the rim off of it, he emptied the Lighthouse. They
followed him into the High Seas like he was the pied piper. My knees
were weak all while we were playing.</TE>
<TE>   "Music has been the thing that has sustained me over the years.
That's what helped me to see a lot of things through--through people
misusing me and abusing me--all of it. Despite all I've been through,
it's still worth it. I guess it's because music is in my skin. Plus I
know I'm fulfilling my dad's dream. Ooh, I'm getting goose bumps."</TE>

<HD>UPN 13's News for Dummies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Television is so gloomy at 10 p.m. that it's swell having an hour of
madcap comedy to lighten the mood. That's where KCOP's nightly "UPN
News 13" comes in.</LD>
<LD>   A newscast for lobotomies:</LD>
<LD>   You get booming, zooming graphics and fast cutting for easily
bored viewers who find 10 seconds an eternity. You get catchy titles
from "Street Team" to "News Wrap" to "Night Beat" to "The Buzz in the
Biz."</LD>
<TE>   You get, with nearly every story, wall-to-wall music, usually
rock--the equivalent of a movie score designed to shape perceptions
by creating a sense of urgency. In other words, this is an hour for
happy toes who like dancing to news.</TE>
<TE>   You get Hal Eisner, Kristin Lang and other goosed-up reporters who
could make even the phone book sound calamitous.</TE>
<TE>   You get faux hip lingo identifyin' police as "cops" and droppin'
the "g" from every "ing."</TE>
<TE>   You get crime and sex galore.</TE>
<TE>   You get thick style smothering a thin Frisbee of content designed
for viewers much younger than the audience that usually watches news.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm thinking it's me. Maybe this is one magnificent news
program whose attributes I'm too old and musty to recognize. As a
test, without revealing my biases, I showed two videotapes of "UPN
News 13" to a class I teach at USC and asked these 27 film students
(ranging in age from 19 to their mid-20s) to write a critique of it.
The snickering I heard as they watched alerted me to the worst: My
callow students did not appreciate UPN having all the Buzz in the Biz
and Street Teams all over the Night Beat.</TE>
<TE>   When reading the critiques, my suspicions were confirmed: complete
ridicule. Wrote one student: "I felt like I was watching a music
video." He was.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the newscasts "shallow and unimportant," another student
complained that "young people are not taken seriously, and their
intelligence is completely underestimated by the older generation."</TE>
<TE>   Said another: "I now know never to turn to UPN 13 for news." Yes,
but what about watching for farce? Where is a laugh track when you
want one?</TE>
<TE>   A sample of other comments: "Ridiculous," "dull and pointless,"
"idiotic," "painfully asinine." And also this: "Anyone with a high
school diploma is much too educated to watch it."</TE>
<TE>   Kids--you just can't please them.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't tell these students that "UPN News 13" somehow won a 2001
Emmy naming it the city's best daily news program longer than 35
minutes. They wouldn't have believed me, and after promising them
that anchors Rick Chambers and Lauren Sanchez were not from "Saturday
Night Live," my credibility with the class was already low.</TE>
<TE>   This newscast is not exactly a fountain of erudition. A wag on the
Internet swears he once heard glossy Sanchez pronounce the silent "p"
in "corps" and the silent "p" in coup. I'm not interested. I'm
diverted by the teleprompter being reflected in her lips.</TE>
<TE>   I've been worrying about KCOP's evening newscast lately. Just
recently I heard Chambers say "police" instead of "cops." And out,
apparently, is my favorite part of the newscast that had an OUTA HERE
banner sharing the screen with the anchors during their farewell
story.</TE>
<TE>   I fear a lowering of standards.</TE>
<TE>   "UPN News 13" is not entirely laughable, its overemphasis on
street crime and other mayhem, for example, joining much of TV news
in creating public hysteria far out of proportion to the real threat.
University of Pennsylvania researchers long ago identified this
media-driven condition as a "mean world syndrome" that keeps
Americans in perpetual fear.</TE>
<TE>   Take a "UPN News 13" hour that aired this week, for example, when
eight of the first 10 stories were about crime.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of its counterparts, "UPN News 13" also feeds U.S.
provincialism by all but ignoring global news that is not about
violence.</TE>
<TE>   The message to viewers is that we are the center of our universe
and, with few exceptions, nothing much of consequence happens outside
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   I was encouraged, though, to see the station air a story this week
about a Bangladesh man who eats poisonous snakes.</TE>
<TE>   How dumb is this news operation? So dumb that the centerpiece of a
recent hour was an expose of "L.A. werewolves." Lang interviewed one
of them, and it was plenty scary. Not the werewolf, her.</TE>
<TE>   This "story" was a mandated tie-in with "Wolf Lake," the UPN
series that precedes the news. It was only one more instance of the
kind of unethical cross-promotion stories that local news stations
work up. Only recently, "UPN News 13" reran unchanged, as if it were
new, its 2001 story on shopping advice from the cast of the UPN
series "Girlfriends." Management apparently regards it as a classic
that deserves to be rerun annually.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sanchez this week did the in-depth voice-over for
"Breakfast Blunders," and Unit 13 reporter Phil Shuman blew the lid
off bargain sunglasses, learning from a wholesaler in Venice Beach
that they were being deceptively labeled by the manufacturer in
China. Meaning, of course, the Street Team will soon be all over
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Shuman wasn't finished, returning Thursday to report the awful
truth about 99-cent condoms. "What are you getting for 99 cents?" he
began. "Unit 13 wanted to know." Roll tape, start condom music.
Shuman to manufacturer: "These are not close-outs, these are not
seconds?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the entire newscast should have worn a condom.</TE>
<TE>   Its Big Story lead bared everything about teen cheerleaders
getting "rah-rah raunchy." UPN was so jarred by its own disclosure
that it was compelled to repeatedly shoot close-ups of teen flesh
just to affirm its existence.</TE>
<TE>   As they say, it's a dirty job ....</TE>
<TE>   The station's burden would not be lifted, though, for soon
children of porn stars were being interrogated in a story so weighty
that Chambers himself had to cover it.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the Body Beat, meanwhile, Unit 13 cameras stayed tight on
the breasts and crotches of women who were improving their
conditioning by "strutting their stuff like strippers."</TE>
<TE>   Only anchor pros would be able to segue from this to breaking news
about an Indian Air Force jet crashing into a bank building in
Jullundur, before swiftly moving on to Part 2 of Mike Tyson cursing
during an interview somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was on to Sanchez's fearless report on kissing. As couples
smooched for the camera, a pop shrink wisely cautioned against
"thin-lips kissing." Finally it was back to the plane crash and a

<HD>'Spider-Man' Comic Fans Say He Passes Screen Test</HD>
<DH>Movies* Fans who have been devouring issues for years say
the new film has done their hero justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know you've done something right when your harshest critics
become your biggest fans. So, if that's true, then "Spider-Man" has
definitely done something right.</LD>
<LD>   Comic-book readers, who for years have pored over issue after
action-packed issue, devouring details of the characters' lives until
they felt a sort of kinship with them, normally come out of movie
theaters disappointed by film adaptations of their favorite
superheroes. But not this time. "Spider-Man" is a big hit, even with
ever-critical comic-book fans.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been reading comic books since I was about 6 years old, and
I have over 3,000 comic books at home," said Matthew Jeffrey, 21, who
wore a black-and-red Spider-Man T-shirt to Golden Apple Comics on
Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles on Saturday after seeing the movie on
opening night.</LD>
<TE>   "It was awesome," he said. "They've been selling the Spider-Man
comics for about 40 years. It's hard to get all that into a two-hour
movie. It seemed like they fit all of that in."</TE>
<TE>   Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962 and has
since become the most popular of the Marvel comic heroes and
villains. Upon hearing that the story of Spider-Man--a geeky teenager
named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a spider and transforms into a
one-man/spider crime-fighting machine--would be turned into a feature
film, comic readers were skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the comic-book movies don't really follow too well with
the comic," said Richard Dunfee, a 21-year-old clerk at Comic Odyssey
in Old Town Pasadena, "but this one did."</TE>
<TE>   There were some changes that the comic-book aficionados were quick
to point out: "Like Peter Parker--his first love was really Gwen
Stacey," said Joshua Hunter, a 15-year-old shopping at the Comics
Factory in Pasadena. In the film, Parker's love interest is Mary Jane
Watson.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't meet Mary Jane until they were adults," said Eric
Delgado, 25, at Golden Apple Comics.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't like the fact that the Green Goblin's face was a
mask," said Mike Johnson, 39, a manager at Golden Apple Comics.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there's the webbing that in the movie is part of
Parker's genetic makeup. In the comic, he has to make devices that
shoot webs. Still, for many, such details didn't really matter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not exactly like the comic book, but it kept to the
story," said Gerson Rodriguez while shopping with his family at
Another World Comics &amp; Books in Eagle Rock. The 25-year-old
Spider-Man fan had three tattoos of spiders on his arms.</TE>
<TE>   Some comic-book readers said they doubted the cast would be
believable in their roles.</TE>
<TE>   But Matt Hawkins, 32, said that Tobey Maguire, who played Peter
Parker and Spider-Man, "carried across the geekiness better than a
Freddie Prinze Jr."</TE>
<TE>   And Kirsten Dunst, who played Mary Jane, fit the part well enough,
even if some fans thought she didn't make a suitable supermodel like
her character was supposed to be. "She screamed real well," said
Jennifer Dos Santos, a 27-year-old from Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   The fans were even able to put aside their reservations about the
computer-generated imaging used in the film's action sequences.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to look like a big video game," Mark Dos
Santos, 28, about scenes in which Spider-Man was swinging through the
city on his webs. "It looked computer-generated, but it didn't bother
me."</TE>
<TE>   James Kuroda, 27, said the filmmakers' use of computer imaging
allowed the designers to pose Spider-Man in the same poses from the
comic. "He moved just the way I always envisioned him to move,"
Kuroda said.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Fox, 20, gave "Spider-Man" a glowing review. "I think it
was one of the best comic-book movies I've ever seen," he said. And
he's already waiting for the sequel.</TE>
<TE>   So is Mark Dos Santos, as long as "they don't do it like the
Batman movies where it's nothing but the villains," he said.</TE>

<HD>'Cover Story' Not an Easy Read</HD>
<DH>The Collage Dance Theatre's site-specific work is an
imperfect fit with the old Herald Examiner building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Heidi Duckler's site-specific performance events for her Collage
Dance Theatre invariably transform distinctive locations into fantasy
environments. An abandoned jail suddenly teems with ghosts of
prisoners past, for instance, or the rituals of service in a busy
hotel unexpectedly change into artifacts of a culture obsessed with
entertainment values.</LD>
<LD>   But somehow the magic doesn't happen in "Cover Story," staged
Saturday in the old Herald Examiner building downtown. Or, rather,
the ghosts, rituals and artifacts of this 1914 newspaper palace don't
seem to suit Duckler's agenda. Despite an array of energetic dancing,
atmospheric music, pulsating video imagery and clever texts (spoken
and displayed as headlines), there's a sense that "Cover Story" just
isn't site-specific enough.</LD>
<LD>   The performance begins in the palatial lobby, replete with rich
wood, gleaming gold leaf, dramatic wrought-iron, polished tile,
intricate marble reliefs, ornate chandeliers, double staircases and
bizarre heraldic shields emblazoned with quills and printing presses.</LD>
<TE>   Before we can inspect all the faces carved into the walls, down
the stairs tap-dance John Kloss and Bob Carroll wearing "Q" and "A"
sweatshirts, and soon Victoria Burnett appears in the guise of an
African griot, or storyteller.</TE>
<TE>   "We gotta know," she sings, reminding us that our expulsion from
Eden resulted from Eve's curiosity about matters that were none of
her business. "She was no different from the rest of us," Burnett
says, "she did want to know."</TE>
<TE>   A surge of Collage dancers through the lobby leads the audience
down the hall to the "Story Department," a room full of desks,
phones, computers and a dozen reporters performing gesture-based
choreography with a growing sense of frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Ellen Byars runs screaming through the room, fights erupt in
the aisles, Kerry McGrath is literally buried in paperwork--but the
only story under investigation is which audience member forgot to
turn off a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the audience hurries through the bowels of the
building toward the pressroom, the cell phone incident has become
major news, with Burnett as a glossy TV reporter interviewing
everyone about the possibility of a conspiracy or cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   Duckler provides plenty of diversions en route--unlikely medical
emergencies in the hospital area, Jessie La Bohn numbly repeating
"I've got mail" while tapping at a computer keyboard with no screen.
But by now it's clear that any building might serve as a backdrop for
these activities. This particular site no longer seems to belong to
Duckler's concept.</TE>
<TE>   Dark and cavernous, the pressroom boasts a long, low catwalk and a
high overhead platform that can move the length of the room--areas
briefly used in a sequence involving the pursuit of a fleeing voyeur
(Paris Wages). Mostly, however, Duckler adapts the space into
something resembling a standard "black box" studio theater. And
that's a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The vignettes performed here by dancers on couches make
provocative points about how we watch everything in our lives as if
we're viewing some TV reality program. But, apart from Wages' odyssey
and a gymnastic catwalk solo by Chris Stanley, the same sequence
could be performed at Highways or the Electric Lodge with no loss of
impact. It's a performance imposed on this space, not something
integral to it.</TE>
<TE>   There's an untold story in this building, a story about William
Randolph Hearst and the concept of information as an empire, about
the gulf between the pretentious overkill of his lobby and the
overwhelming smell and sound of his presses below.</TE>
<TE>   "Cover Story" features typically skillful contributions from
choreographer/director Duckler, writer Terry Wolverton, composer Amy
Knoles, video artist Douglas Thompson and many others. But, sooner or
later, you come to feel that they moved into the Herald Examiner
building with all their ideas in place and never let the site's
creepy contrasts in style and scale inform the result.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday we'll know how this story ends," sings Burnett in her
final transformation as a media celebrity. Maybe so, but there's a
better story in this unforgettable environment that the very
watchable but conceptually displaced "Cover Story" never covers.</TE>
<TE>   Collage Dance Theatre continues in "Cover Story" through May 19 at
the Herald Examiner building, 1111 S. Broadway, Los Angeles.
Saturdays, 7 and 9:30 p.m.; Sundays, 5 and 7:30 p.m. $15 (students,
seniors) to $25. (323) 655-8587.</TE>

<HD>Altan Displays Mastery of Celtic Sound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Altan did what it does best Friday at UCLA's Royce Hall. The Irish
supergroup, touring in support of its new "The Blue Idol" album, once
again displayed the virtuosic mastery it has brought to traditional
Celtic music.</LD>
<LD>   As always, Altan's music was ignited by the two-violin team of
Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh and Ciaran Tourish.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the rhythmic charge in one quick stepping reel after
another, their brilliant togetherness generated the sort of ecstatic
excitement characteristic of the best improvisational music.</LD>
<TE>   The greatness of Altan can be traced to the fact that--beyond the
fiddling of Ni Mhaonaigh and Tourish--there are the superb guitar
work and gentle vocals of Daithi Sproule and the rich musical
foundation provided by Kieran Curran on bouzouki and Dermot Byrne on
accordion.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the willingness to occasionally season their
traditional songs with more contemporary sounds reminiscent of the
long-gone Pentangle.</TE>
<TE>   And finally--the crowning touch--there is the sweetly embracing
voice of Ni Mhaonaigh. Singing "Uncle Rat" and the Robert Burns
classic "Green Grow the Rushes," she added tenderness and warmth to
the program.</TE>
<TE>   Folk singer Kate Rusby, who opened the show, burst onto the
English music stage in 1999 when her "Sleepless" album won Britain's
Mercury Music Prize as one of the best British albums of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But her performance, despite its engaging collection of tunes, was
undermined by the audio system, which buried her laid-back vocals
beneath the overamplified sound of her guitar, cittern and accordion
backing.</TE>

<HD>'Azahar' a Rich Ethnic Blend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Adam del Monte had offered a CD of music played in "Azahar," a
program of music and dance at the Alex Theatre in Glendale on
Saturday night, there would have been a long line of customers in the
lobby. There is something richly seductive and complex in the
rhythmic mix of Del Monte's compositions, whether he's pulling a
haunting melody out of fluttering embellishments during a guitar solo
or combining efforts with flutist Pedro Eustache (impressive on many
instruments), bass guitarist Asaf Kofler, guitarist Antonio Triana
and percussionist Patric Hetzinger.</LD>
<LD>   When not percolating in intriguing compositions by Del Monte
("Chalaco," "Sambule") or Kofler ("El Azahar"), the musicians
provided accompaniment for dancers of the Laila del Monte Dance
Company, sometimes accenting a movement vocabulary that came mainly
from flamenco and the Middle East. One brief but affecting moment
occurred when Eustache's breathy flute added a shiver to Laila del
Monte's shimmering flamenco footwork.</LD>
<LD>   This was during Laila del Monte's fascinating solo, "Al Anda Luz:
Solea por Buleria," in which she playfully integrated her soft,
quicksilver flamenco style with the isolations and torso rolls of
belly dance.</LD>
<TE>   More traditional flamenco solos were performed by Irit Spektor,
Marcellina de Luna and Del Monte herself, and these had bracing
passages. On less firm ground were attempts at incorporating two
belly dancers (Raven and Kristy Ibarra-Armas, also listed as Lailah).</TE>
<TE>   The evocative flamenco singer Antonio de Jerez seemed underused.
Actress Ann Lluch occasionally recited Spanish poetry with eloquence.
The overarching concept stated for "Azahar"--to recall Spain's Golden
Age, when differing cultural energies combined creatively--found its
surest realization in Laila del Monte's fusion dance and Adam del
Monte's eclectic and compelling music.</TE>

<HD>Audience Tracking Becomes High-Tech</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting* The two major ratings companies are testing
systems that will give advertisers much more detailed information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY GENTILE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a world with hundreds of television channels, figuring out who's
watching what is about to get easier.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, viewing habits have been tracked through devices
attached to TVs and radios in the sample. Thousands of households
also kept paper diaries during the crucial television "sweeps"
periods in February, May, July and November.</LD>
<LD>   That low-tech system is getting a major upgrade.</LD>
<TE>   The two major companies that produce television and radio ratings
are testing next-generation technology that would give advertisers
the data they need to decide where to spend their billions of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The most promising is the "portable people meter," a beeper-like
device being developed by Arbitron, which logs programming seen or
heard anytime, anywhere by whomever is wearing it.</TE>
<TE>   People need to do nothing more than wear it during the day and
place it in a home docking station each night so data can be
transmitted to Arbitron.</TE>
<TE>   The device uses sensitive microphones to pick up codes embedded in
television, radio and even streaming Internet broadcasts--and it
includes a motion detector to verify someone is actually wearing it.</TE>
<TE>   "With the portable people meter, we know that you carried it and
what it was exposed to," said Thom Mocarsky, a spokesman for
Arbitron, which compiles radio ratings.</TE>
<TE>   With diaries, he said, Arbitron has to guess whether a blank diary
page means "they didn't listen to radio or forgot to log in."</TE>
<TE>   Arbitron just completed the first phase of testing, strapping
meters on 1,500 testers in Philadelphia. The results were more
comprehensive than data collected by current means--in large part
because viewing and listening outside the home was included.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen Media, which provides television ratings, is watching the
tests closely, with an eye toward forming a joint venture with
Arbitron to roll out the technology nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen is testing its own meter to monitor similar embedded
codes. Unlike the Arbitron device, the Nielsen meter attaches to
individual television sets.</TE>
<TE>   Both systems could become essential as digital television
eventually replaces the analog technology now in use.</TE>
<TE>   "Digital changes the way television is transmitted, so the
channel-based measuring system goes away," said Nielsen spokesman
Jack Loftus. "Everyone is going to encoding, and the race is on to
see whose code is better."</TE>
<TE>   The constant tracking afforded by personal people meters, Arbitron
believes, will eventually eliminate the need for sweeps weeks, when
quality programming is often bunched together on the same nights to
the frustration of viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, national and local television ratings are measured by
Nielsen Media Research using electronic devices supplemented four
times a year by paper diaries.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, 5,000 randomly selected homes are equipped with a
meter on each television in the house to log which channels are
watched. A second measurement is made by assigning each household
member a separate button on the device, which is turned on and off
when the person starts and stops watching television.</TE>
<TE>   Detailed demographic statistics for various age groups are gleaned
from the data.</TE>
<TE>   Radio ratings are collected entirely using paper diaries.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers are excited about the reams of new data and say they
can't wait for the technology to be perfected.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Cue From the Past</HD>
<DH>Satoko Fujii's colorful and skillful playing hearkens back
to the sounds of the '60s and early '70s.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The jazz '90s were largely dominated by young artists captivated by
the bop and hard bop '50s and '60s--a kind of neo-jazz classicism. So
it's probably not surprising that the first decade of the new
millennium seems to be taking the influence pattern a decade further,
with a growing number of artists looking closely at the avant-garde
'60s and early '70s.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese pianist Satoko Fujii, who made a far-too-brief visit to
Los Angeles on Saturday night via an appearance at Rocco's, is one of
the outstanding voices in a new movement that includes such musicians
as Dave Douglas, Andy Milne, John Zorn and Cuong Vu. Working with a
quartet that included her husband, trumpeter Natsuki Tamura, bassist
Takeharu Hayakawa and drummer Tatsuya Yoshida, she performed a set
that included only two tunes--each a stretched version of her highly
exploratory, remarkably colorful, improvisationally based music.</LD>
<TE>   Fujii's most appealing compositional asset is her capacity to
organize her music in atmospherically dramatic fashion. In one of the
works, "Toward to West," the mood shifted in slowly evolving fashion,
from wildly percussive rhythms to pensive harmonic passages. The
soloing, mostly handled by Fujii and Tamura, was deeply reminiscent
of '60s styles. Echoes of Cecil Taylor surged through Fujii's often
violent attacks upon the keyboard, while Tamura's passages--sometimes
in completely a cappella segments--possessed the sort of humor and
imagination typical of the trumpet work of the late Don Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to level the same sort of criticism at the '60s
revivalists that was leveled at the original practitioners, of
course: The music is just the product of a bunch of fingers randomly
thrown at keys; it doesn't require any traditional musical skills.
And there's some truth to the criticism, in terms of both past and
present decades.</TE>
<TE>   But Fujii--like many of the younger artists--is a well-trained
musician, who also seems tapped into contemporary pop and rock music,
not hesitating to cross over into those areas during passages within
her larger works. Which probably explains why her edgy, intrepid
music appeals to younger audiences who are far more resistant to the
jazz sounds of the '50s. Call it an interesting trend in the making.</TE>

<HD>Capt. Invincible's Greatest Feat: Returning on Home Video</HD>
<DH>Movies* The campy 1983 musical, starring Alan Arkin and
Christopher Lee, has had a checkered release history. Now it's back,
on DVD.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONALD LIEBENSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its premiere on DVD, Philippe Mora's "The Return of Captain
Invincible" is at last "into the blue."</LD>
<LD>   Despite a checkered distribution history, the 1983 Australian
musical spoof of superheroes has garnered something of a cult
following among fans of Alan Arkin, Christopher Lee and "Rocky Horror
Picture Show" creator Richard O'Brien, who contributed three
memorable songs.</LD>
<LD>   The flight to DVD was no less bumpy, with the tragic events of
Sept. 11 casting a shadow on the film, whose rousing conclusion
features the hero rallying the country while circling the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<TE>   Previously available on a now-scarce, poor-quality, pan-and-scan
version released in 1988 by Magnum Entertainment, the film, like its
tarnished hero, has at last found redemption. Elite Entertainment's
superb disc ($20) boasts a near-pristine transfer from the sole
surviving negative and presents the film for the first time in the
wide-screen format with a remixed Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Deliberately hard to pigeonhole in the grand eccentric Australian
tradition, "Captain Invincible" is quirky to beat the band. Arkin
stars as the good Captain, "man of magnets ... legend in leotards,
and an inspiration to America's youth." But his career as a
crime-buster and Nazi fighter ends amid accusations of being a
communist sympathizer, and he winds up in Sydney, Australia, a broken
alcoholic.</TE>
<TE>   Lee plays the "brilliant fiend," Mr. Midnight, whose minions steal
a top-secret weapon, the hypnoray. The now-decrepit Invincible must
rediscover his superpowers to take Midnight down and save New York
City.</TE>
<TE>   You can be forgiven if "Captain Invincible" flew under your radar.
Outside of two test screenings in Phoenix (under the title "Legend in
Leotards") and another in Wichita, the film did not receive
theatrical distribution in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   According to director Mora, the film "made it as far as the
projection booth" before distributor Jenson-Farley Pictures went
bankrupt the week it was to be released. A tangle of lawsuits and
rights squabbles further hampered the eventual home video release.
Magnum Entertainment went out of business in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   This is what make its release on DVD so satisfying to Mora. "It's
tremendous to have it out there," he enthused in a phone interview,
"especially in a technically good form."</TE>
<TE>   Echoes actor Lee, who makes the most of his rare chance to do
comedy and to sing on screen: "If it's got a new public, fine,
because I thought it was a great deal better than it's been given
credit for. Considering [the ridiculous superhero uniform] he was
required to wear, Alan Arkin gave an extraordinary performance.
Friends of mine who are opera singers in America told me they enjoyed
the musical numbers, which I think are witty, well done and well
performed."</TE>
<TE>   It was Mora's inspiration to transform "Captain Invincible"
(originally written as a straight comedy by Stephen E. de Souza) into
a musical in homage to the songfests he thrilled at seeing while
growing up in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw a musical, whether it was 'Oklahoma!' or even an Elvis
Presley movie, it was a big event," he said. "I thought there was an
audience for them if I could just find an innovative way in, as did
'Saturday Night Fever' and 'All That Jazz.'</TE>
<TE>   "In the early '80s, when Australia was funding films with tax
incentives, you could be experimental," he said. "I had the leverage
to say I want to do 'Captain Invincible' as a musical."</TE>
<TE>   For his lead actor, Mora originally sought James Coburn, who,
having played Derek Flint, was seemingly no stranger to outrageous
films. But he didn't "see it," the director said. "He told me,
'Philippe, I just don't get this. Why would I [in one scene] be
attacked by vacuum cleaners?' I didn't have a good enough answer. The
funny thing is, when we were doing the scene with Alan, he said,
'Philippe, why am I being attacked by vacuum cleaners?' I said, 'Too
late.'"</TE>
<TE>   Mora, a friend of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" director Jim
Sharman, recruited Richard O'Brien to contribute songs. "I thought he
would get a kick out of writing a song for Christopher," Mora said.
"And he jumped at the chance."</TE>
<TE>   Though the film was made during what Mora called "more cynical
times," "Captain Invincible" was intended to be a sincere,
star-spangled celebration of Americana.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Mora contacted composer Irving Berlin for permission to
use a clip of Kate Smith singing "God Bless America" from the 1943
Michael Curtiz extravaganza "This Is the Army." Berlin was in his
late 90s then but still went to his office to work. "The clip fit our
movie so well," Mora said. "I explained the film to him. There was a
long silence. Finally, he said, 'Mr. Mora, that will be $10,000.'"
Mora paid.</TE>
<TE>   While the DVD was in the works before Sept. 11, "Captain
Invincible" went from oddball pleasure to something more poignant in
the wake of the terrorist attacks. Following his triumph over
Midnight, Invincible flies above New York City to the cheers of the
crowd. "Together," he proclaims, "we're not alone. We're not
helpless. Together, we're part of the roughest, toughest, biggest,
kindest, fairest, bestest darn gang in the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   At a time when the entertainment industry was sensitive to any
song, movie or TV show that unwittingly echoed the tragedy, Elite had
to take a step back for fear of appearing to exploit the film's
newfound timeliness. Executives decided to digitally remove the image
of the twin towers from the DVD's box art.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost spooky to see the film now," Mora said. "It's sad
that it took a disaster to restore [the patriotic feelings] that were
unashamed on my part."</TE>

<DH>USC's first Paderewski Lecture brings Polish music to
audiences and showcases the talents of pianist Zygmunt Krauze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every so often, the Polish Music Center at USC reminds us--with
festivals, conferences and concerts--that Polish music did not begin
and most certainly did not end with Chopin. This year, it has come up
with a new way of bringing music-making Poles to the wider attention,
by instigating an annual Paderewski Lecture. USC's connection with
the legendary Polish pianist, composer and statesman is that the
university gave an honorary degree to Ignacy Jan Paderewski in 1923,
and the center holds some of his papers.</LD>
<LD>   The first "lecture" Friday night in Newman Hall featured the
Polish composer and pianist Zygmunt Krauze. Though more concert than
discourse, Krauze did touch on matters Polish, such as explaining the
historical traditions of folk music and dance. He had the use of a
local troupe, Polish Folk Dance Ensemble Krakusy, which demonstrated
the steps of the polonaise and mazurka. And Krauze connected his own
modern style to Chopin by playing a mazurka and polonaise augmented
with his improvisations. But interesting as this was, the real value
of Krauze's appearance was simply to provide an arresting composer, a
major figure in Europe though inexplicably little known in America,
with a rare local forum.</LD>
<TE>   Krauze, who is 63, is a fascinating figure in Polish music. His
roots are to Witold Lutoslawski, the most important composer in the
flourishing of Polish music after World War II, which led to a public
avant-garde scene in the '60s and early '70s that was unique among
Soviet Bloc nations. Lutoslawski began by writing in an advanced
national style, as a kind of Polish Bartok, but once he discovered
the chance composition of John Cage, he became somewhat more radical
if always elegant in sonic exploration. Krauze, as a member of the
more rebellious next generation, followed in Lutoslawski's footsteps
closely at first but kept going.</TE>
<TE>   Krauze's lecture-recital was broad. The first half looked at
history and the influence of folk music and dance in piano works by
Chopin, Karol Szymanowski, Lutoslawski and an example of Krauze's
student pieces from 1958, "Five Folk Melodies," which he said he had
forgotten about and just recently discovered on faded yellow
manuscript paper long buried in an old bureau. After intermission,
Krauze offered examples of that exciting new music scene in Warsaw
that quickly moved him from the folk style.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the scope of this recital was too broad--after all,
Boguslaw Schaeffer's "Non Stop," alone, lasted eight hours when
Krauze premiered it in 1964. Yet in a mere three-minute excerpt,
Krauze was able to attack the piano ferociously and with seductive
gentleness, to bang on it as a percussion instrument, to play on the
strings inside, to whistle and stomp the floor and throw in some
drunken Chopin and Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   One way Krauze connects the past with the present is through the
improvisations he likes to tack on to his Chopin performances. These
include getting stuck on a small figure and repeating it over and
over to mesmerizing effect. He did that to the Mazurka in A minor,
Opus 67, No. 4, and the Polonaise in E-flat minor, Opus 26, No. 2.
But even when Krauze plays Chopin or other earlier music straight, he
has an improvisatory style in which exaggerated rubato and a heavy
foot on the pedal create lingering harmonic resonances and blurred
chords. A performance of Paderweski's Nocturne in B-flat major, Opus
16, No. 4, in fact, was nearly as weird and woozy as Krauze's own
"Nightmare Tango."</TE>
<TE>   Krauze's most interesting example of his own obsessive interest in
gripping sonority was "Stone Music," in which he placed stones on the
strings of the piano, and then struck the strings with metal bars.
With microphones amplifying the small sounds, the result was a
gorgeously enveloping ringing.</TE>
<TE>   But this was nothing more than a taste of a composer of a wide
range of works (he has just had a new opera performed in Warsaw to
great acclaim and has a children's opera on the way, as well as a
work for the Bavarian Radio Orchestra). His appearance last spring at
the UCSB New Music Festival was a revelation--his chamber music
creates a startling, intense, original, immediately communicative
sound world that seems riveted to the earth and the emotions, music
both fresh and timeless. This is an important voice and I hope the
Paderewski Lecture will just be the beginning of the Polish Music
Center's efforts to get it heard here.</TE>

<LD>For anyone still fretting over a gift for Mother's Day, CBS has come
to the rescue, and six days early to boot. Just sit the dear old gal
in front of the tube tonight at 8:30 and let the domestic sitcom
"Yes, Dear" deliver a gift-wrapped episode showing just how
indispensable a mother can be.</LD>
<LD>   And how irritating, overbearing and controlling, too--but that's
only to make the Mother Knows Best payoff work all the better.</LD>
<LD>   Vicki Lawrence and Tim Conway of the suddenly hot-again "Carol
Burnett Show" reprise their roles as Natalie and Tom Warner, who
decide to spend a few days visiting son Greg (Anthony Clark) and his
wife, Kim (Jean Louisa Kelly).</LD>
<TE>   As in-laws, Kim and Natalie have the oil-and-water chemistry that
seems a staple of sitcoms today, but tonight it's Greg who begins to
chafe under his mother's relentless ordering-around of his father.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that if he can just get his father away from his mother
for a couple of days he can reinstill some independent thinking in
the man, Greg virtually kidnaps him for a male-bonding getaway to Las
Vegas, with neighbor Jimmy (Mike O'Malley) tagging along. But from
the moment the three walk into their hotel, it's one small disaster
after another, with the "comedy" built on just how far doddering Dad
has slipped into ditherhood. Like a lot of TV, it's amusing if you
don't think about it too hard.</TE>
<TE>   Conway is a master at shuffling befuddlement, and his skills,
along with Lawrence's true-confession moments back home ("I kissed
Ringo Starr!"), make this episode a cut above the norm for "Yes,
Dear."</TE>
<TE>   And as long as the second-season show holds on to its mother lode
of a time slot (between "The King of Queens" and "Everybody Loves
Raymond"), that will suffice.</TE>

<DH>TV* Asian viewers are showing a preference for home-grown
shows and others produced outside the Hollywood system.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Glittery Hong Kong dramas dominate prime time in Malaysia and
Singapore. Latin America's steamy telenovelas heat up the screen in
the Philippines. In Vietnam, viewers follow the tangled twists of a
half-dozen Chinese dramas.</LD>
<LD>   Across Asia, fans are eating up a steady diet of imported soap
operas.</LD>
<LD>   Once separated by language barriers and historical enmity,
countries are now vying for prime-time space in each other's
television markets.</LD>
<TE>   "Nationalism has been erased through the medium of television,"
said literary and media critic Bienvenido Lumbera of the University
of the Philippines. "It's a kind of youth culture that makes the
transfer from one culture to the next quite easy."</TE>
<TE>   Chong Eu Pui, a 28-year-old production assistant from Kuala
Lumpur, said she has friends who used to travel to Singapore when
Hong Kong soap stars were visiting.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hong Kong stars are much more popular than our Malaysian
actors," Chong said. "They're much more glamorous and they are better
actors."</TE>
<TE>   Soap operas, whether from Australia or Asia, appeal to viewers
through a classic formula of common emotions and fantasy settings,
said Christina Slade of the University of Canberra, who organized a
recent conference on soaps in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   For many in poverty-stricken developing countries, the appeal of
escapism--beautiful homes, beautiful people--is self-evident.</TE>
<TE>   "The themes are about love, sex, fidelity, domestic arrangements
and money," she said. "There are very few societies outside that
range of issues."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the popular soaps are not Hollywood exports; they're made
and principally marketed within the region. Since the late 1990s,
South Korea has become a soap opera powerhouse, producing and
exporting programs to China, Taiwan and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Park Jae-bok, general manager of MBC Productions, which exports TV
dramas, attributes the success to fans' desire to see Asian faces.</TE>
<TE>   "Asians are growing sick and tired of Hollywood products. They are
sick of seeing white people and black people on their screens," Park
said.</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam, posters of South Korean stars like Jae Young-joon
adorn many teenagers' walls, and their photos are exchanged like
baseball cards.</TE>
<TE>   "South Korean soap operas are attractive to young Vietnamese
viewers because it's close to their daily life, plus the shows have
beautiful artists with fashionable clothes and makeup," said Nguyen
Kim Trach of state-run Vietnam Television.</TE>
<TE>   Trendy youths in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City wear the darker makeup
and body-hugging fashions of Seoul's soap stars. One Korean soap,
"Yumi My Love," about a fashion designer, sparked the opening of Yumi
fashion shops in Hanoi a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the reaction of the countries' governments sometimes isn't so
enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, China banned a popular Taiwanese soap, "Meteor
Garden," which depicted the high school romance between a poor girl
and a member of a gang of spoiled rich kids. And in Vietnam, a
state-run newspaper put the dominance of Chinese and South Korean TV
programs on its list of the "10 most embarrassing cultural events of
2001."</TE>

<HD>Rossetti Quartet's New Violinist a Plus for Festival</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For several years, the Ventura Chamber Music Festival has established
itself as a notable enterprise, in part through programming that has
ushered in out-of-town performers and carefully mixed diversity with
crowd-sating accessibility.</LD>
<LD>   This year's agenda takes a different turn, with the lion's share
of focus on one internationally known star, Spanish pianist Alicia de
Larrocha, appearing in recital Thursday and as orchestral soloist
Saturday at Ventura College Theater. Otherwise, the 2002 festival is
largely populated with returnees, giving it a last-year's-model air.</LD>
<LD>   Violinist Corey Cerovsek, a festival regular, performs Wednesday,
and the Rossetti String Quartet, an impressive group that appeared
last year, has returned for two concerts, including one Friday at San
Buenaventura Mission.</LD>
<TE>   The Rossetti performance last Friday, in the lovely and agreeably
resonant Community Presbyterian Church, gained an unexpected
freshness with the debut of a new voice in the first violinist role.</TE>
<TE>   Nina Bodnar, the formidable Rossetti leader, recently departed
from the group and was replaced by the young, conspicuously gifted
Timothy Fain, a Santa Monica native well-received in New York and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The result added drama to the evening. All ears were on the new
kid, a quick study who started with the group only a week earlier but
acquitted himself with aplomb in a meat-and-potatoes program of
Haydn, Mozart and Borodin.</TE>
<TE>   The program changed, too, with originally planned works swapped
out for Haydn's moving Quartet in D, Opus 20, No. 4 and Mozart's
Quartet in G, K. 387. It's a logical enough pairing, the former
having influenced the latter. Both works vary in emotional and
digital intensity but arrive at a soft, sighing finale, like an
introspective denouement.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti members have been together long enough to have
established a musical bond. One could sense that, however bold and
propulsive their sound, a settling process was underway, and things
weren't always seamless. The situation improved throughout the
performance, however, with Fain's dynamic presence in the lead. By
the time Borodin's crowd-pleasing Quartet No. 2 in D came after
intermission, the quartet was in fine ensemble fettle.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar, dreamy melodies of the second and third movements
were treated with proper care and subtlety, making what can be a
confection a lustrous thing.</TE>

<HD>A Life of Accidents, a Quest for Answers</HD>
<DH>If some are truly prone to injury, then why? An oft-hurt
woman explores potential causes--physical and psychological --after
one mishap too many.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask my mom and she'll tell you I've always been a klutz. Since I was
a kid, if there was a head to bonk, it would be mine. A toe to stub,
a stairwell to trip down, a hot coal to grab? You've got the picture.</LD>
<LD>   It's quite literally a painful legacy that includes one broken
wrist, several toes and a rib; concussions, a few; one second-degree
burn from a motorcycle tailpipe; sprains too numerous to recall; a
cracked coccyx; a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder; and across my
knuckles cuts that dug so deep I see the scars when I type.</LD>
<LD>   Then, almost five years ago, my left leg was nearly severed in a
horrible mishap on a Malibu canyon trail with my horse: While
attempting to lead him through a creek I ended up startling him and
was trampled, his powerful hind hoof cutting straight through my left
shin like an ax chopping through a tree branch. Thankfully some of my
calf muscle and vital nerves remained, but I was unable to walk or
crawl. I was saved by a man who heard my screams and literally kept
me from bleeding to death by squeezing my artery with his fingers.</LD>
<TE>   During the year and a half it took to recuperate from this level
of trauma, I had a lot of time to do nothing but think. I realized
that in the months before I was trampled I had experienced a
particularly acute rash of accidents--I had fallen down a stairwell
and had a painful spill off my horse--and that this began after my
then-husband had been released from a drug-rehabilitation program.
Clearly my pattern of frequent injury was beyond average and the
severity seemed to be intensifying. Could accident-proneness be
traced to specific causes, or was it simply bad luck?</TE>
<TE>   The term "accident-prone" entered the vernacular in the early
1900s following a debate between European and American psychologists
on the idea that some people were more likely to experience
unintentional injury than others. Although the term became part of
our language, it has no clinical meaning, says Jess F. Kraus, a
professor of epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health and
director of the Southern California Injury Prevention Research
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "People in this research field have divorced themselves from the
term 'accident' in general, because it carries with it a sense of
inevitability," Kraus says. "Yes, people can move in and out of
cycles of injury for reasons that are not quite clear, but the fact
is that a substantial number of accidents can be prevented."</TE>
<TE>   During the last century researchers from various
backgrounds--psychiatry, orthopedics, transportation safety and
childhood development, among others--have tried to clarify those
reasons, without reaching a definitive conclusion. Is it personality?
A genetic predisposition to take risks? A form of "acting out"
psychological issues? The only concrete statement I've been able to
pull away from the array of disciplines is that, barring injuries
that result from unsafe work environments, frequent accidents are a
complex phenomenon that can be a warning sign for physical,
psychological or emotional issues. Exploring what reasons might be
keeping me in harm's way became a quest for self-understanding.</TE>
<TE>   Much research has tried to define personality types or traits that
would provide a fundamental explanation for who gets hurt more often
and why. Risk takers are often pinned as likely suspects: By the law
of averages, these personalities will get hurt more often.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists at the University of Iowa concluded in a 1999 study
that, among children, temperament seemed to be a big factor in risk
taking. The researchers, who published their findings in the Journal
of Developmental Psychology, were trying to determine why some kids
continually overestimate their physical abilities and end up having
accidents. "Children who are active and think quickly, the ones that
seek out new sensations, seem to have more accidents in their
history," the researchers wrote, observing that this described kids
who were more extroverted. Another factor in some children who had
more accidents was "low inhibitory control"--the ones who got hurt
didn't pause to consider possible dangers associated with their
actions. Studying this in children, they concluded, may help explain
patterns that endure into adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, British researchers at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology described three other klutz
traits: undependability and disagreeableness, and, on the other end
of the spectrum, extreme "openness," which they defined as the
tendency to learn from experience and be open to suggestion from
others.</TE>
<TE>   All of these elements no doubt count somewhere in the equation of
accidents. But speaking as a person who's had her share of
life-threatening mishaps, I'm left with a feeling of frustration.
Besides realizing that I might not be the best person to drive a
school bus, how can this knowledge improve my life? By labeling
someone as constitutionally more likely to have accidents, where is
the possibility for change?</TE>
<TE>   While friends or family might call describe you as a klutz or
having "two left feet," sometimes we place those labels on ourselves.
By labeling your personality as accident-prone, says Roger Vincent, a
spokesman for Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of
Accidents, you have something to blame, rather than accepting the
responsibility for changing your behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Clyde Flanagan, a psychiatrist at the University of South Carolina
School of Medicine, likens accident-proneness to a fever. "It's a
symptom of something else," he says. "It becomes hard to say there is
one direct cause of accident-proneness, because a lot of things
interrelate."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone can be accident-prone for different reasons at different
times in life. Physical concerns should be considered, especially if
a pattern of accidents has a sudden onset. "There could be changes in
vision, hearing problems, or even a possible tumor in the cerebellum,
the part of the brain that controls coordination," Flanagan explains.</TE>
<TE>   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is known as a
cause of accident-proneness in children because it creates
impulsiveness, but it might also factor into adult problems, Flanagan
says. After a thorough medical exam has ruled out potential medical
problems, he says, psychological explanations have to be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because if you've hurt yourself once, it is likely that you
will hurt yourself again, according to research in the field of
emergency medicine. A 1996 study from the University of Mississippi
Medical Center published in the Journal of Trauma explored why trauma
victims are so likely to have a repeat occurrence, even among those
whose accidents are unintentional. The conclusion: Traumatic
accidents are often rooted in psychological disorders such as
depression, which have to be addressed to reduce the risk of being a
repeat trauma victim.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to use a term called 'depressive equivalent,' where
depression in children is expressed through activity," Flanagan says.
In adults the same idea is called "agitated depression," in which
conditions such as low self-esteem are manifested behaviorally.</TE>
<TE>   Sigmund Freud was suspicious of seemingly unintentional injury; he
proposed that the greater the degree of injury, the more clearly it
expressed a desire for self-destruction. Could accidents be an
unconscious way of hurting yourself as a form of punishment for deep
feelings of guilt, a misguided expression of grief, or even as a
self-defeating strategy to avoid dealing with success?</TE>
<TE>   Freud's concept of the unconscious, masochistic desire for
self-harm has "gone out of style" among psychiatrists, says Stuart
Shipko, a Pasadena psychiatrist who evaluates work-related accidents
and injury in legal cases. The modern clinician, Shipko says, "is
more apt to consider anxiety or depression as the cause of repeated
accidents, because those conditions impair attention and
concentration. I've also observed the phenomenon of accidents and
illness as a way to get attention."</TE>
<TE>   The attention-getting behavior is often seen in professional
athletes, says Edd Wilbanks, a sports psychologist in Shreveport, La.
Players who frequently visit the rehabilitation room come to be known
as "malingerers." Says Wilbanks: "These are burned-out athletes who
have fallen into an unconscious pattern of getting hurt because the
attention gained from being injured has become more gratifying than
playing on the field."</TE>
<TE>   One well-documented cause of accident-proneness is also quite
common--stress. People who are under heavy stress are often tired and
unfocused. In this state of mind, it's just easier to have an
accident while behind the wheel or navigating a steep staircase. One
strategy for coping with this problem is to be aware of it and
attempt to compensate.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbanks advises his stressed-out clients, who include
professional tennis and baseball players, to attempt to focus their
attention by visualizing the "biggest, reddest, ugliest stop sign in
the world." "As soon as a negative thought comes into your head--and
that means anything that doesn't have directly to do with what you
are engaged in at the moment--throw up that mental stop sign."</TE>
<TE>   The Zen Buddhist notion of "mindfulness," the practice of
moment-to-moment awareness gained through silent sitting known as
zazen, became for me a kind of insurance for living more safely.
Before my leg injury I had never considered that sitting still would
be anything but a waste of time. Now, taking time to do just that is
a requirement for assessing what I'm thinking and feeling--for not
being, as my family for years called me, "an accident looking for a
place to happen."</TE>
<TE>   In recovering from my accident I've taken my life apart and put it
back together to understand what had led me to a life of injury. I
think, somewhere along the line, I figured out that letting "the
world" hurt me served a few functions extremely well: It provided me
with a kind of nurturing I didn't otherwise know how to attract, I
couldn't be pinned with total responsibility, and it provided
physical pain, a reason to cry that others could understand. So much
easier than trying to explain all the accumulated rage and numbness
and sadness.</TE>
<TE>   This is what I can tell you about me today: The less I accept the
label of klutz and the more aware I am about the circumstances of my
life and the way things affect me, the fewer accidents I have. Not in
my car, not on my horse, not in my house. "Accident-prone" is not a
description of my character; it's a state of mind I enter.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claims and advertisements touting oxygen and ozone therapies seem to
be everywhere. On the Internet and in magazines, these alternative
treatments are promoted with such names as hyper-oxygenation,
bio-oxidative therapy, oxymedicine and ozone therapy.</LD>
<LD>   Those who promote these therapies do so on the unfounded
assumption that all disease, even disease as serious and complex as
cancer, is caused by a lack of oxygen in body tissue. Their
"remedies" claim to increase oxygen in tissues and thus improve the
body's ability to deter or fight disease. Not only are such therapies
groundless and a waste of money, some of them are potentially
harmful.</LD>
<LD>   Oxygen does have its legitimate uses, of course. Patients with
emphysema or those who have had surgery typically use tubes placed
under the nostrils to deliver oxygen to the lungs, and hyperbaric
oxygen treatments can be given in pressure chambers. But you should
be wary of others.</LD>
<TE>   Ozone therapy, for example, is presented on at least one Web site
as an effective treatment for cancer, arthritis, immune deficiencies,
infections, fibromyalgia and other ailments. And ionized water is
touted as a way to provide the body with extra oxygen and energy. If
we were like fish and had gills, maybe we could separate oxygen from
liquids. We can't.</TE>
<TE>   Some newspaper ads promote "stabilized oxygen molecules in a
liquid solution of sodium chloride and distilled water," said to make
pure oxygen available for absorption directly into the bloodstream,
bypassing the lungs. It is said to effectively treat problems, from
fatigue to illnesses. But, again, we can't bypass the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen peroxide for years has been promoted as a cure for
everything from asthma to warts to hemorrhoids. One advertisement
claims that it improves the body's use of oxygen by adding several
drops of "food grade" hydrogen peroxide (read: marketed by health
food companies) to water. It is recommended also as an additive to
baths, for use as an enema, and, off the really deep end, by
injection, all to cure various ailments. Such treatments make no
contribution to the body's oxygen needs. We can get oxygen into our
bodies by one route: the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Ever hear of "clustered water"? It sells for about $35 a bottle
and is advertised as having six-sided H20 molecules that can pass
through cell walls to enhance the work of enzymes and nutrients in
the body. Even though the manufacturing process is patented, there is
no scientific proof of its benefit. Chemists, biochemists and
physiologists tend to call this concept "crackpot chemistry" and
"pseudoscience."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is "Vitamin O," a bottled saline solution ($20 per
bottle) that claims to contain 30,000 parts per million of oxygen. It
is supposed to make oxygen available for absorption into the
bloodstream where it can promote better health.</TE>
<TE>   One of several problems with this claim is that the maximum
solubility of oxygen in water (which is two parts hydrogen to one
part oxygen) at room temperature is only 7,500 parts per million.
Remember, too, the body does not absorb oxygen into the bloodstream
through the intestines.</TE>
<TE>   You've heard of ozone--that light blue layer of gas high above the
Earth that protects us from too much ultraviolet light from the sun.
Made up of oxygen molecules with an added atom of oxygen, ozone can
be created when an electric spark is introduced in a chamber of pure
oxygen. It is a powerful oxidizing agent because it generates "free
radicals" when it decomposes. Free radicals destroy natural
biological substances.</TE>
<TE>   Probably as a result of that ability, ozone "air purifiers" became
popular. They produce ozone and are advertised for use in homes where
people are sensitive to indoor air pollution. But ozone is toxic. Too
much of it irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Even low-level
exposure may cause problems with lung capacity in healthy adults.
Ozone is fine in the upper atmosphere, but at ground level it's a
harmful pollutant.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago the California Department of Health Services
warned consumers about false claims concerning ozone devices used as
air purifiers. Despite the potential dangers, ozone therapy sometimes
is used to treat AIDS patients. Used in Europe, it is also
recommended by some American doctors. So far, there is little, if any
reliable evidence that the claims made for ozone therapy as an AIDS
treatment are valid. Research is continuing in Italy, however.</TE>
<TE>   Should you think about using any alternative oxygen or ozone
therapies, particularly those using a liquid substance to be
ingested, remember that oxygen is absorbed into our bodies through
our lungs, not through the stomach or intestines. Breathing normally
at sea level, one takes in air that includes 20% oxygen. For a normal
person, that's enough.</TE>

<HD>Some Parasites Are Worming Their Way Into a Welcome</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My parents didn't believe in giving their children much candy or
snack food ... but who can stop a kid? I gleaned far and wide--even
picking pre-chewed gum from the filthy playground floor.</LD>
<LD>   "It was probably a good thing for you," jokes Donald Harn,
professor in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at
Harvard School of Public Health. Had my squalid behavior led to an
encounter with a parasitic worm (as my sister darkly threatened that
it would), so much the better for me.</LD>
<LD>   Harn isn't suggesting that kids do as I did, since there can be
bad germs lurking in dirt and other kids' saliva. But he and a
respectable number of other scientists think that dirt exposure in
general and worm infestations in particular aren't half as bad as
they're made out to be. Yes, worms are gross, and some are certainly
harmful (causing bilharzia, elephantiasis, anemia and more). But
others are fairly benign.</LD>
<TE>   And worms, say the scientists, have a positive, nurturing side.</TE>
<TE>   They've certainly been a fact of life for most human beings in the
past. Infestations with worms (by which we mean primitive "helminths"
such as hookworms, pinworms, tapeworms and whipworms) used to be
common in the U.S. They remain so in less-developed parts of the
world where sanitation is poor, parents are more relaxed about their
kids playing in dirt where they can pick up helminth eggs and people
don't scrub and sterilize their environments with quite such vim and
vigor as we do.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the odd thing: As we killed off the worms, the rates of
certain ailments started to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Allergies like asthma, for instance, are much more common in
industrialized societies than primitive ones, are more common in
cities than the countryside--and are on the rise in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Autoimmune diseases of various stripes are also increasing in the
Western world. Inflammatory bowel disease, for example, is a rarity
in less-developed countries and was unheard of in this country until
the early 1930s, says Dr. Joel Weinstock, director of the center for
digestive diseases at the University of Iowa. "Whenever you see
industrialization and improved lifestyle, you see a rise," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Linking immune disorders to a worm shortage might seem nutty.
After all, many things change in parallel without being connected.
But in defense of their theory, scientists point to studies like
this: In the African country of Gabon, schoolkids whose urine tested
positive for eggs of helminths called schistosomes were less likely
to react allergically to a house dust mite allergen.</TE>
<TE>   In other studies, mice with inflammatory bowel-like diseases got a
lot better when infested with worms or chemicals made by the worms.</TE>
<TE>   The theory makes sense, the scientists add, when you consider that
we evolved in the constant presence of worms--and that worms can live
a heck of a long time in our gut even though we've got a pretty fancy
immune system.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them can live in us for 10 years!" says Maria
Yazdanbakhsh, an immunoparasitologist at Leiden University Medical
Center in the Netherlands. "If you're going to live in a host for 10
years, you have to do something to allow yourself to stay around."</TE>
<TE>   What the worms do, says Yazdanbakhsh, is suppress parts of our
immune system a tad. (She and Harn have even found some of the
chemicals that do it.)</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, the worms are no longer in us--and it's happened so
fast that there's been no time for us to adapt to the change. As a
result, our immune system doesn't develop quite right, say the
scientists. Without the presence of worms to keep it in check, parts
are hyperreactive--increasing the risk for allergies, bowel
inflammations and other immune-linked ailments.</TE>
<TE>   If the worm theory is true, what do we do? Get worms? Many would
find that hard to swallow, and Weinstock understands. "Nobody likes
to think they have a worm within them," he says. Right now Weinstock
is testing worms as treatment, periodically feeding more than 100
sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease with a harmless whipworm that
normally infests pigs and that hangs around in the human gut for just
a short time. But Weinstock also imagines a day when short-term
infestations with specially picked harmless worms might help prevent
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe one day we'll be giving kids little pills with modified
helminths in them, and maybe those kids will have little critters in
them," he says. "And maybe when they grow up they'll be less prone to
immunological disease."</TE>
<TE>   Another, arguably more palatable, prospect might be figuring out
just which chemicals do this immune-shaping trick and using them
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not give my kids worms to eat," Yazdanbakhsh says. "But I
would give my kids a preparation that I knew would do the job."</TE>

<LD>If you want to live a long, happy life, think again.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Duke University followed more than 4,000 older
people for a decade and found that women who lived longest were
mildly depressed. The finding was published in the American Journal
of Geriatric Psychiatry.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't quite understand the finding," said Dr. Dan Blazer, a
professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Duke and co-author
of the study in the May-June issue. This jump in longevity was seen
only in women. Women with mild depression, determined by a diagnostic
questionnaire, were 40% less likely to die during the study period
compared with women with no depression or those with more serious
forms.</LD>
<TE>   Blazer suspects mild forms of depression could protect against
death by slowing people down, giving them more time to pay attention
to their minds and bodies.</TE>
<TE>   He and his colleagues separated the group into those without
depression, those with mild depression and those with severe
depression. Those with six to eight symptoms--feelings of
hopelessness, sadness, problems concentrating or sleeping, for
instance--would be considered mildly depressed.</TE>
<TE>   What might be the benefit of mild depression? Blazer said there
could be an evolutionary explanation, one put forth in the work of
Dr. Randolph M. Nesse of the University of Michigan. "It's like fever
symptoms," Blazer said. "Mild fever is actually good. It attacks the
organism and puts the body in a mode of rest."</TE>

<LD>Despite the word-of-mouth on the libido-squashing effects of
antidepressants, a policy of "don't ask, don't tell" seems to pervade
doctor-patient relationships.</LD>
<LD>   According to a University of Virginia study of more than 6,000
adults in 1,101 primary care clinics throughout the United States,
sexual problems are twice as prevalent as doctors think they are.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-seven percent of patients taking one of the newer
antidepressants reported some problems with sexual desire, arousal or
orgasm; physicians estimated the prevalence to be 20%.</LD>
<TE>   People taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram,
fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertaline) and venlafaxine XR had higher
rates of sexual dysfunction than those taking bupropion SR or
nefazodone.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of sexual difficulties increased with age, especially in
those over 50; higher doses of the antidepressant; other illness
and/or medications. Problems were also most prevalent in married
people, and in those who smoked six to 20 cigarettes a day.</TE>
<TE>   Because trouble with sex is enough reason for many people to stop
drug treatment, people who are having difficulty should bring it up
with their doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "Changing antidepressants, or [using] options supported by other
studies, such as adding an antidote or lowering the dose of
medication might help," says the lead author of the study, Anita H.
Clayton, president and vice chairwoman of the department of
psychiatry at the University of Virginia Health System in
Charlottesville.</TE>

<TE>   Hypnotherapy Can Ease Symptomsof Irritable Bowel Syndrome</TE>
<TE>   For many people, especially women, who are twice as likely to have
irritable bowel syndrome than men, the disrupted bowel habits cause
bloating, abdominal pain and may lead to anxiety and depression.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a large study of patients in the United Kingdom's National
Health Service not only has found that hypnotherapy helps ease
symptoms, it also has revealed some major differences in how men and
women respond to this mind/body approach.</TE>
<TE>   After 12 weekly sessions with a hypnotherapist and learning
techniques, such as relaxation exercises, to do at home between
sessions, 78% of the 232 patients had improved bowel habits. Only 9%
were slightly worse. All measures of quality of life improved
significantly, and there was a reduction in anxiety and depression.</TE>
<TE>   Women in the study outnumbered men 4-1. On average they felt worse
than men before treatment and improved most afterward. According to a
scoring system of symptoms, women improved 52% compared to 33% in
men. In fact, one group of men--those with IBS-related
diarrhea--improved least, for unknown reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Among several theories for the gender gap is that IBS affects
men's bodies differently.</TE>

<TE>   Sports Drinks Provide More Zip Than Flavored Waters, Study Finds</TE>
<TE>   With all the flavored bottled waters and sports drinks to choose
from, trying to decide which one is best can make you late for the
game. A recent study comparing water and a typical carbohydrate and
electrolyte sports drink may help you cut to the chase.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that competitive athletes who drank the sports
drink--in this case, Gator- ade--tired less quickly and ran faster
than those who quenched their thirst with flavored water. Unlike
previous studies of endurance exercise, this study looked at mental
and physical performance in activities that simulated high-intensity
competitive sports with a lot of stop-and-go movement, such as
tennis, soccer and basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Ten college athletes did four 15-minute sessions of brisk walking
to fast running, including intervals of four-minute sprints and
vertical jumping. Questionnaires and motor skills tests to measure
performance, mood and concentration were done during brief breaks and
the halftime rest period.</TE>
<TE>   Before the exercise session and at specific intervals during the
workout, the students drank either the sports drink or flavored
water. There was a 37% delay in fatigue among those who drank the
sports drink and their mental functioning and mood were maintained,
meaning, report the researchers, they were able to keep their "head
in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Although Gatorade is a 6% carbohydrate and electrolyte beverage,
J. Mark Davis, professor of exercise physiology at the University of
South Carolina in Columbia, says a sports drink with a 6%-8% carb
content would probably have the same result. He doesn't believe the
electrolytes are responsible for the results. "The benefits we saw
are likely due to the flow of glucose to the brain and better balance
between brain chemicals such as serotonin, which is linked to
relaxation, and dopamine, which is related to arousal, motivation and
energy," Davis says.</TE>

<TE>   Tissue Glue Cuts Down on Face Lift Recovery Time</TE>
<TE>   People having face lifts have often felt frustrated by the down
time the recovery requires--but that lengthy down time may soon be a
thing of the past.</TE>
<TE>   An increasing number of surgeons are using a kind of tissue glue
that may hasten patients' return to public life. The glue is sprayed
on the underlying tissues and when the skin is placed down over it, a
kind of sticky clot quickly forms to seal the newly positioned
tissues together.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny vessels that carry blood and lymph are also sealed,
causing less bruising and swelling. Although fibrin sealants are
often called "glue," the spray doesn't replace stitches. Sealants
have been used in Europe for years and appear to be catching on in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   At the annual meeting of the American Society for Plastic Surgery
last week, a show of hands in the "What's Hot" symposium indicated
that about a third of surgeons are now using either commercial
sealants or those made from the patient's own plasma. (Commercial
ones are made with donated plasma that has been treated to inactivate
viruses such as those responsible for HIV and hepatitis. All sealants
include some type of bovine or cow protein as well.)</TE>
<TE>   "You do look presentable sooner," says Los Angeles surgeon Peter
Fodor, who has used the glue for about four years for face lifts and
tummy tucks. However, he adds, minimal bruising and swelling doesn't
necessarily mean faster healing. Still, for many patients, fewer days
in hiding is worth the extra cost, which ranges from $350 to $500.</TE>

<HD>Long-Term Relief Seen for Symptoms of Crohn's Disease</HD>
<DH>Research: Usually used to treat flare-ups of the bowel
ailment, regular doses of drug Remicade can safely extend periods of
remission, study shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMMA ROSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>When Crohn's disease is hard to treat, patients are more likely to
achieve long-term remission if they get regular infusions of the drug
Remicade, new research confirms.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors usually give people with moderate or severe forms of the
bowel ailment a single infusion of the anti-swelling drug to treat
acute attacks, but the effect wears off after a while.</LD>
<LD>   Remicade, the first drug approved specifically for Crohn's
disease, has not been recommended for ongoing use, but experts say
research published this week in the Lancet medical journal provides
evidence that it is safe and effective enough to keep taking
Remicade, generically known as infliximab.</LD>
<TE>   The study, the largest ever conducted on Crohn's disease, found
that patients who got injections every eight weeks were half as
likely to suffer a relapse over seven months as those who got a dummy
drug.</TE>
<TE>   "At last we have a therapy that truly allows us to manage this
disease over time, rather than just treating flare-ups," said lead
investigator Dr. Stephen Hanauer, professor of medicine at the
University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "Ongoing treatment with infliximab decreased disease activity,
prevented sudden attacks and enabled patients to reduce or, in many
cases, completely eliminate steroids."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William Sandborn, a Crohn's expert in the Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, who was not involved in the
research, said the findings represent an important advance for
Crohn's patients.</TE>
<TE>   "It should change practice for this group of patients, but I think
investigators should keep looking to combine infliximab with other
drugs and should keep looking for other therapies so that we can get
remission rates at a year at 75% or 80%," Sandborn said.</TE>
<TE>   The prevalence of Crohn's disease varies from 28 people per
100,000 in some countries to 108 cases per 100,000 in others. It
afflicts more than 500,000 people in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It causes severe diarrhea, bleeding, fever and malnutrition. There
is no cure.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers believe that immune cells in the gut overreact to the
presence of bacteria. The resulting inflammation causes the wall of
the digestive tract to shred and break down.</TE>
<TE>   It is managed by diet restrictions and medication to suppress the
immune system and calm inflammation. In severe cases, damaged
portions of the intestine are cut out.</TE>
<TE>   Remicade is a bioengineered drug that roams patients' blood to sop
up an immune system protein called tumor necrosis factor, responsible
for much of the swelling.</TE>
<TE>   The medication is also used for rheumatoid arthritis, another
immune system disease.</TE>
<TE>   In Crohn's it is used mostly for patients with moderate or severe
cases who do not do well on the traditional medication, which
includes immune-suppressing drugs, steroids and other
anti-inflammatories.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment involved 355 patients whose symptoms had improved
within two weeks of a flare-up dose. They were divided into three
groups. Every eight weeks for a year, the patients were given an
intravenous infusion of either 5 milligrams per kilogram of body
weight, 10 milligrams per kilogram or a fake injection.</TE>
<TE>   After 30 weeks, people getting Remicade were twice as likely to
still be in remission as those getting the dummy drug.</TE>
<TE>   The drug worked for 54 weeks in the high-dose group and 38 weeks
in the low-dose group, while those on the dummy injection started
getting worse after only 19 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of serious infections such as tuberculosis or sepsis--the
main side effect from immune-suppressing drugs such as Remicade--was
the same among the three groups, the study said.</TE>

<HD>Doctors Should Prescribe Tried-and-True Over New Drugs</HD>
<DH>Prescriptions: A study shows some medicines have harmful
side effects that were not detected in the pre-market FDA trials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC KAUFMAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newly approved drugs are riskier than older ones and doctors should
avoid prescribing them when equally effective and long-used
medications are available, according to a study in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Assn.</LD>
<LD>   In a provocative review of a quarter-century of unexpected and
harmful side effects from the most innovative new prescription drugs,
the authors found that more than 10% either had been taken off the
market or required new warnings against dangerous "adverse
reactions."</LD>
<LD>   "Based on our results and those of others, clinicians should avoid
using new drugs when older, similarly (effective drugs) are
available," the authors conclude. "Patients who must use new drugs
should be informed of the drug's limited experience and safety
record."</LD>
<TE>   The findings add to the increasingly contentious debate over
whether the Food and Drug Administration is doing enough to protect
consumers from the risks posed by new drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Among the medications taken off the market in 2000 are the
nighttime heartburn drug Propulsid (removed because of fatal heart
rhythm abnormalities), the diabetes drug Rezulin (removed after
causing liver failure), and the irritable bowel syndrome treatment
Lotronex (removed for causing fatal constipation and colitis.)</TE>
<TE>   While the FDA's job is to assure that drugs coming on the market
are safe and effective, officials there acknowledge that a small
number of harmful side effects undetected during pre-market trials
are inevitably discovered only after a drug is approved and used by
millions of patients.</TE>
<TE>   Because the FDA approved many more drugs during the 1990s than in
previous decades, more unexpected harmful side effects are appearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our data found that only half of all serious adverse reactions
are detected seven years after a drug enters the market," said the
study's lead author, Karen Lasser. "Millions of patients are exposed
to potentially unsafe drugs each year."</TE>
<TE>   In an accompanying commentary in the journal, a top official with
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Policy, Robert
Temple, argued that the study's assessment of the agency's track
record on safety issues was misleading. He said many of the warnings
added after drugs were on the market were added because of subsequent
scientific discoveries or because medications known to be toxic
turned out to be more toxic than expected.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a useful study," Temple said in an interview. "But when I
looked more carefully, many of the problems described are not good
reasons to avoid using a new drug.... Patients needn't be nervous
about using new drugs prescribed by their doctors."</TE>
<TE>   Temple said that recent changes in how drugs are developed should
help limit the number of problematic side effects in the future. He
also said that regulators are now focused in particular on potential
liver damage from new drugs, the cause of some of the most
significant drug withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   The drug industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, on Tuesday attacked the JAMA
study as "misinformed and misleading."</TE>
<TE>   "We note that Dr. Lasser et al. state that the benefit/risk ratio
of new medicines sometimes shifts as new information is acquired
after marketing, but they fail to state that it often shifts to the
benefit side," PhRMA said in a statement. "For example,
cholesterol-lowering drugs have been found after marketing to have
significant additional benefits."</TE>
<TE>   But Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a
doctor and co-author on the JAMA study, said that despite FDA
assurances, significant safety problems remain. "Rather than getting
better, we believe the situation is just as bad, or worse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the study, most from Cambridge Hospital and Harvard
Medical School, used FDA announcements and the Physicians' Desk
Reference--an annual compendium of drugs on the market--to study how
many medications were withdrawn and how many required new safety
notices to doctors, called "black box" warnings. Between 1975 and
1999, they report, 548 new chemical entities were approved by the FDA
as prescription drugs, and 56 were either withdrawn or given new
black box warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Because many of the 548 drugs were approved recently, the
researchers used a probability analysis to estimate how many would
require FDA action in the future. Based on experience, they concluded
that about 20% of the drugs would acquire a new black box warning
over a 25-year period or would be taken off the market.</TE>

<HD>It Took a Mountain to Move This Couple</HD>
<DH>Fitness* A commitment to a grueling hike in New Zealand
gets a 50-ish pair off the couch and onto the trails.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, I had been in decent shape, hiking and inline
skating on weekends, with a couple of step classes or brisk walks
thrown in during the week. Not in the same league as a Madonna or
Janet Jackson--but good enough. It's easy, though, to get out of the
exercise habit, and growing family obligations gradually took me away
from the gym.</LD>
<LD>   So last fall my husband, Bill, and I decided to do something to
force us to get back into an exercise routine. While planning a
February vacation to New Zealand, we made reservations for the
Routeburn Track, a three-day, 28-mile guided trek through the rugged
terrain of the majestic Southern Alps.</LD>
<LD>   Since there was no way we could complete the trip without getting
into decent physical shape, the looming hike provided ample
motivation to jolt us out of our lethargy. (The humiliation of having
to be helicoptered off a remote mountain or the idea of forfeiting
$1,000 in advance registration fees were not appealing options.) So
on the first Saturday after New Year's, we dragged ourselves out of
bed and headed to Los Liones hiking trail in Topanga State Park in
Pacific Palisades.</LD>
<TE>   The trail, which is three miles round trip, follows a thickly
foliated path with winding switchbacks, and a slight elevation that
takes you from sea level to 1,525 feet. The reward at the top is a
spectacular coastline view from Malibu to the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
The trail ends at a flat clearing where it joins the East Topanga
Fire Road, a well-trod dirt path carved out of the side of the
mountains that encircle Topanga Park.</TE>
<TE>   That first day, we barely made it to the end of the Los Liones
trail in under an hour, then hobbled to an overlook that juts out
over the ocean a half mile from the trail's end. After fortifying
ourselves with water and trail mix, we pushed ourselves up the fire
road, which has about a 30-degree incline. But laboriously trudging
uphill left us gasping for breath. Feeling defeated and horribly out
of shape, we only got about 200 yards before we quit, and were
bypassed by a group of runners nimbly trotting up the hill like
gazelles.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, hiking 28 miles with backpacks seemed like sheer
madness.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, on the same hike, we shaved 10 minutes off our time,
making it to the overlook in 40 minutes. Then we trooped a half a
mile up the fire road. All in all, we hiked four miles in about two
hours. Not too shabby, we thought, for two 50-somethings who had just
slithered off the couch.</TE>
<TE>   During the next four weekends we become regulars on Los Liones. On
the final Sunday before we left for New Zealand, we practically
bounded up the trail, making it to the overlook in 20 minutes,
completing more than five miles in less than two hours. Strains of
the "Rocky" theme echoed in my head.</TE>
<TE>   We were ready. Or so we thought.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, we joined 20 other hikers on a bus that
transported us from Queenstown, a tourist town that is one of the
adventure sports capitals of the world, to the Divide, a cleft carved
by the massive glaciers that formed New Zealand's vast, unspoiled
fiordlands.</TE>
<TE>   At around noon, after stopping along the way for tea, we finally
set foot on the densely wooded trail. Our group included three female
guides, two lawyers, a young investment banker from Hong Kong and his
girlfriend, and 10 middle-aged Japanese women from Osaka. And,
somewhat encouragingly, three doctors--a husband and wife from
Virginia, and a widower from southern England--and two tall, blond
nurses from Sydney, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Within a half an hour, I knew I had made a big mistake. I had
never hiked with a backpack, and the trail was much steeper than the
Topanga Park fire road I had found so daunting. The Japanese
women--all veteran hikers--were marching effortlessly up the trail,
literally leaving me in their dust while I buckled under the weight
of the pack. The bus was gone, though, so I was stuck--three days and
27.9 miles to go.</TE>
<TE>   The good news was that we had clear weather with temperatures
hovering in the 60s each day. The fiordlands have an average annual
rainfall of 10 feet, so we were lucky to avoid hiking in a relentless
downpour. I was mostly too tired, though, to notice the rich variety
of ferns, orchids, and fuchsia that dotted the lush trail, or to
enjoy the breathtaking vistas. Emerging from the Silver Beech forest
in mid-afternoon, I collapsed at Earland Falls, a glacial stream that
spills several hundred feet down a mountainside. We were barely
halfway to where we would camp that night, and I had no desire to
take another step.</TE>
<TE>   The women from Osaka were already at the falls, nibbling on
chocolates, chatting gaily and sunning themselves on the rocks,
looking like they had done nothing more strenuous than cruise the
mall.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we reached the lodge near Lake MacKenzie, I was
slipping on the rocks out of weariness, which frightened me because I
knew the most serious accidents happen when you're distracted. But we
made it through the first day, and settled in at the lodge, which had
dormitory-style rooms with bunk beds adjoining a kitchen and
cavernous dining hall.</TE>
<TE>   After scarfing enough food to feed a small army, I climbed into my
bunk. Our roommate, Fung Lui, the banker from Hong Kong, busied
himself studying the trail map for what seemed like hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Tomorrow ... more ... difficult," he finally pronounced in
halting English.</TE>
<TE>   I could hardly wait.</TE>
<TE>   Day two, which entailed traversing the granite face of a mountain,
wasn't just difficult--it was downright treacherous. Clinging to the
mountainside along a foot-wide trail ledge, I made the mistake of
looking down and immediately froze in terror: Beneath me was a sheer
drop of more than 5,000 feet. This was not in the travel brochure.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't look down," my husband commanded.</TE>
<TE>   "Just find a place to put your feet--and quit taking such delicate
little steps," suggested Margaret, one of the Australian nurses. Like
a human shuttlecock, I inched across the mountain face, with Bill
pulling me along, and the Australian nurses pushing me from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Climbing down through rocky terrain after lunch was just as
tricky, if not as harrowing. Somehow, we made it to the lodge about 6
p.m. after more than eight hours on the trail. My feet ached, my left
knee was swollen and throbbing, and I scarcely had the energy to peel
off my clothes and hiking boots before I stepped into the shower.
Later, I held court in a corner of the lodge, my knee propped up on a
chair and covered with ice, joking with my two new nurse friends,
Margaret and Betty, about how we'd all be in the wheelchair brigade
on the next day's six-mile hike.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, descending the rocky mountain slope was arduous
because I could barely bend my knee. Once we hit the flat pastures
around the Routeburn River, however, I was pleasantly surprised. The
trail was easy--packed dirt surrounded by leafy trees. Like a horse
heading back to the barn, we picked up the pace, and covered the
remaining four miles in less than two hours. We had done it: We
finished the Routeburn Track, and even got certificates at a
celebratory dinner that night in Queenstown. Accomplishing our goal
was exhilarating, though admittedly there are a lot of less
expensive, and equally challenging, ways to force yourself off the
couch. For us, though, it did the trick. We're still regulars at Los
Liones, and planning our next hiking trip, albeit one that's closer
to home. And this time, we'll be in much better shape.</TE>

<LD>As a physician, I was greatly interested by your article about the
outbreak of a strain of Group A streptococcus that is resistant to
macrolide antibiotics--key drugs that are used to treat not only
strep throat but also pneumonia and other serious infections
("Resistant Strep Sounds a Warning," April 22).</LD>
<LD>   While the story noted that this outbreak has major implications
for the way doctors think about and prescribe antibiotics in this
country, it should also have major implications for the continued use
of antibiotics in meat production.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "It's the Next Best Thing to Mother's Milk" (April 22): The
assertion that infant formula is the "next best thing" to mother's
milk is analogous to saying that a steady diet of fast food and soda
is the next best thing to fruits and vegetables.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, far too many mothers believe this view.</LD>
<LD>   It is the rare mother who cannot breast-feed, but many mothers are
told, probably by doctors, that formula is just as good.</LD>
<TE>   What a shame that in our country many children, our future
leaders, are beginning life without the milk that nature intended.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I know squats are great for my legs and derriere, but I
feel a little wobbly when I do them. What can I do to improve my
balance and avoid injuries?</LD>
<LD>   TRACI ROSSI</LD>
<LD>   Akron, Ohio</LD>
<TE>   Answer: You're right--squats are very effective. They require you
to use secondary lower body muscles that isolation exercises (such as
the leg extension) don't bring into play.</TE>
<TE>   Rest assured that it's normal to feel a little off-balance while
doing them. But why don't you try an exercise called the "box squat"?
It will give you extra support, and you can improve your squatting
technique without feeling as though you're going to lose your balance
and topple over.</TE>
<TE>   The Box Squat:</TE>
<TE>   * Standing in front of a bench with your feet shoulder-width apart
and pointed out slightly, hold a weighted bar across the upper part
of your back (right below your neck) or hold hand weights at your
sides.</TE>
<TE>   * Keeping your torso upright, lower yourself until your butt is
touching the bench. Relax your thigh muscles, then push yourself up
using your hamstrings and gluteals.</TE>
<TE>   Do three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions until you feel comfortable
doing the squats without the bench.</TE>

<LD>   Background:  ASHA is a professional association of more than
100,000 speech, language and hearing therapists and researchers. Its
Web site is meant to help people with speech and hearing problems
understand what ASHA members do, and help them find the most
effective therapy.</LD>
<TE>   What Works: This site addresses communication problems of most any
kind: age-related hearing loss; delayed speech development in young
kids; problems due to oral cancers, stroke, stuttering. Each cause
demands different kinds of attention, and ASHA spells this out. The
site also has a good myth/fact page on hearing aids, and advice on
how family members can communicate with a child or parent with a
speech or hearing problem. The site comes up short in providing
evidence for these various therapies, so it's hard for consumers to
know exactly what kind of improvement to expect, but it gives a good
idea of what services are out there.</TE>

<LD>Plastic surgeons use scalpels, syringes, lasers and chemicals to
improve upon nature--but they're never satisfied. They periodically
gather to learn new techniques, trade tips and debate ideals of
physical beauty.</LD>
<LD>   This year, at a Las Vegas meeting of the American Society for
Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, they talked about fat recycling, face-lift
refinements, wrinkle fillers, breast enlargement and, of course,
Botox.</LD>
<LD>   One of the main side effects of the scowl-eliminating drug,
approved for that use last month by the Food and Drug Administration,
may be preventable, they learned. Dr. Michael A.C. Kane, a Manhattan
plastic surgeon, said that in more than 5,000 cases he was able to
avoid or reduce the eyelid-drooping condition called ptosis.</LD>
<TE>   Kane suggested that post-Botox ptosis occurs in people whose
eyelids already droop. Most have long compensated by using forehead
muscles to keep the eye open; Botox injections simply return it to
its natural droopy state. With proper screening of patients, he
prevented the effect by injecting less Botox into their forehead
muscles.</TE>
<TE>   Some presentations focused on a closely related substance, called
Myobloc, as a Botox alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Botox, a potent poison that can be injected to ease forehead
lines, crow's feet, laugh lines and neck bands, comes from botulinum
toxin strain A; Myobloc is from strain B. Both temporarily eliminate
wrinkles by paralyzing underlying muscles. Myobloc, made by Elan
Pharmaceuticals, currently is approved for relief of painfully
contracted neck muscles.</TE>
<TE>   A Myobloc injection is quicker to paralyze the muscle, typically
within about 12 hours versus a couple of days for Botox. But its
effects don't last as long, according to Dr. Jason N. Pozner, a
plastic surgeon from Boca Raton, Fla. Botox works for about three
months. Pozner found that Myobloc lasts an average of nine weeks.
Because Myobloc is more acidic, it can cause more discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most intriguing topics at the meeting was the potential
of recycling stem cells harvested from patients' own liposuctioned
fat. These cells would be used to create new tissues that could be
put back into patients' bodies during later cosmetic or
reconstructive procedures.</TE>
<TE>   With liposuction the world's most-performed cosmetic surgical
procedure, that potential is particularly attractive to doctors who
are already, in the words of plastic surgeon Dr. Richard D'Amico of
Englewood, N.J., "in the business of harvesting fat."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, researchers at UCLA, along with colleagues overseas,
are looking into ways they might reuse the collagen-rich material
that's suctioned along with the fat. Collagen provides structure to
skin and connective tissue.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the fat removed with liposuction also can be used to
reshape the face and body.</TE>
<TE>   Plastic surgeons also debated how to get better, more natural
results in rejuvenating the face and neck. Some prefer cutting away
sagging skin and repositioning underlying tissues and fat; others
favor injecting fat and other substances into hollows and lines to
restore more youthful contours. Dr. Sydney Coleman, a Manhattan
plastic surgeon, suggested that colleagues should think about the
potential of the syringe, not just the scalpel, in rejuvenation.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman also drew attention to the few reported cases in which
fillers injected into the face had caused blood clots in the eye,
resulting in blindness. He suggested these incidents might be
prevented with smaller-gauge needles and exerting less pressure when
injecting into the face.</TE>
<TE>   Plastic surgeons today increasingly offer their patients
noninvasive techniques to improve their looks, including laser and
other light treatments that don't break or burn the skin. These seem
to work best at fading redness and discoloration from sun damage. The
verdict remains out on their ability to plump and tighten skin.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, many plastic surgeons began selling patients a
device that uses plastic domes and vacuum suction to increase breast
size. Brava hit the market with great fanfare. With an investment of
$2,500 and much of users' leisure time, the device promised to
permanently increase a small-breasted woman's bra size by about an
extra cup without surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But while initially promising, the device apparently doesn't work
in many women, even when they faithfully wear it at least 10 weeks as
advised, some doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they went to market too early," said Dr. Candido E.
Fuentes-Felix of Huntington, N.Y., who noted the difficulty in
getting an objective measurement of the promised breast enlargement.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Steven Teitelbaum, a Santa Monica plastic surgeon who sold the
device to 20 patients, said most of those women came back
dissatisfied. At least two subsequently opted for breast implant
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10, 12 and even 14 weeks, the difference is almost
imperceptible," he said. His only satisfied patients were those who
had very loose breasts after breast-feeding or losing a lot of
weight, or those who wore it "month after month," sometimes up to 50
weeks. Thin, athletic women with minimal body fat got no response, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other physicians defended the device. Dr. Thomas J. Baker, a
Florida plastic surgeon who had announced promising results at the
group's meeting two years ago, announced that further study of 125
women, 95 of whom completed a total of 10 to 26 weeks in the device,
showed that those who stuck with it got the best results.</TE>
<TE>   Some products had more favorable reports, such as the Ultrasoft
lip implant, which may be the first one to pass the "kiss test." In
most people, the soft tubular material under the lip tissue can't be
felt by a partner, even during a passionate kiss.  Unlike injectable
fat or collagen, which the body eventually absorbs, the Ultrasoft
implant lasts indefinitely, yet can be removed.</TE>
<TE>   The lip plumper is a polymer tube about the diameter of a coffee
stirrer. It is inserted into the lip through a tiny incision at the
corner of the mouth, which is undetectable after it heals. Two or
three months after insertion, the person doesn't notice it, reports
William Adams, a researcher studying the implant at the University of
Texas Southwestern. And the inert material poses no risk of
rejection.</TE>
<TE>   While some doctors prefer the customization that injectable fat
and collagen allow, Stephen A. Goldstein, a clinical associate in
plastic surgery at the University of Colorado Health Care Sciences in
Denver, says, "I think there is a place for both. Some patients like
a trial run with one of the injectables before having something more
permanent put in.... But the Ultrasoft is easy to remove if the
patient decides they don't like it."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting also included sessions in which doctors discussed why
they no longer use certain techniques. Many said they now do far more
limited face-lifts, making shorter incisions and repositioning fat
pads to avoid a tight look.</TE>

<DH>Study: Preliminary reports that starchy foods contain a
possible carcinogen shouldn't cause panic among French fry and potato
chip lovers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG STOLTZ and SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was widely reported last week that Swedish researchers had
discovered that some highly starchy cooked foods, including potato
chips, French fries, biscuits and bread, contained a chemical called
acrylamide--a probable cause of human cancer.</LD>
<LD>   You have questions? So glad you asked.</LD>
<LD>   Question: Oh boy, another food scare. So you're going to tell me
not to eat bread or French fries?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: No way. In fact, lead researcher Lief Busk, along with
Swedish, British and World Health Organization officials, urged
consumers not to make any dietary changes based on this preliminary
report. "It's not more dangerous to eat these foods today than it was
a year before," Busk said. "There is no reason to be alarmed or to
drastically change your eating habits."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: So why are news organizations reporting this stuff?</TE>
<TE>   A: Because it's interesting preliminary science about food
safety--and the Swedes thought it significant enough to release the
information now, before it's been published. Before anybody acts on
the thought that these kinds of foods are dangerous, the science will
have to be peer-reviewed, replicated, explained, teased out and
debated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: So how do those bad things get into the food?</TE>
<TE>   A: Busk says that acrylamide appears to form in carbohydrate-rich
foods during cooking. The higher the temperature and the longer a
food cooks, the higher the levels of acrylamide. Fried foods had the
highest levels, soft breads had the lowest. Low levels were found in
pizza, pancakes, waffles, fried fish fingers, meatballs, vegetarian
schnitzel and cauliflower gratin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What if it turns out they're right, that fried starchy foods do
have this cancer-causing chemical in them?</TE>
<TE>   A: Experts will probably warn you not to eat much of them, which
is pretty much what they say now anyway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why is this coming to light now?</TE>
<TE>   A: Science is getting better at measuring all kinds of chemicals
in food and water. As Busk notes, this stuff has been there for
thousands of years; we just couldn't measure it before. It's not new
that harmful substances, even carcinogens, are in food--think of
nitrates in hot dogs and trace mercury in tuna. Minute traces of bad
things are found throughout the water and food supply. In most foods
we eat, the benefits of the nutrients far outweigh the infinitesimal
risks from chemical exposure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you about to tell me not to take preliminary scientific
information out of context--and remind me that it's far more
important to eat a wide variety of foods and not think any of them
are magically beneficial or inherently malevolent?</TE>
<TE>   A: Why, yes.</TE>

<HD>Not All Dairy  Is Taboo for Lactose Intolerant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA URSELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lactose, the sugar found in milk, is digested in the intestine by the
enzyme lactase. People who lack this enzyme suffer from a condition
called lactose intolerance.</LD>
<LD>   In their bodies, milk sugar moves undigested into the colon, where
it is fermented by bacteria. Within 15 minutes to two hours of
consuming milk, this bacterial fermentation causes symptoms such as
bloating, cramping, abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and nausea.</LD>
<LD>   Lactose intolerance, which tends to run in families, affects an
estimated 75% to 80% of Asian, Native and African Americans and half
of the country's Latino population. A fifth of white Americans are
also affected from birth. Intolerance to lactose can also be
triggered by an intestinal disease or food poisoning.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, levels of lactase tend to diminish naturally as we
age. Although most infants produce enough lactase to digest breast
milk, the levels begin to fall after weaning in those who are lactose
intolerant.</TE>
<TE>   Whether inherited or acquired, the condition is often thought of
as an "all or nothing" problem for which the only cure is elimination
of all dairy foods. In fact, most people produce at least some
lactase, necessitating only partial removal of milk from the diet.</TE>
<TE>   The American Dietetic Assn. says that four out of five people with
even the lowest levels of lactase can drink a cup of milk a day
without discomfort. Discovering how much can be tolerated is
important because milk is a rich source of calcium, providing
three-quarters of this mineral's intake in the American food supply.
Like phosphorous--also found in milk--calcium is crucial for building
and maintaining strong bones.</TE>
<TE>   To establish tolerance levels, start with small amounts of
lactose-containing foods and gradually increase them until symptoms
occur. Smaller, more frequent servings of lactose-rich foods are
often easier to digest than larger single servings.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, although hard cheeses are made from milk, they
contain little lactose, making them generally well-accepted. Yogurt
is another exception. Made from fermented milk, scientists have
discovered that the "friendly" bacteria in yogurt digests some of the
lactose present.</TE>
<TE>   The life of the lactose-intolerant person is also made easier by
the virtually lactose-free and reduced-lactose brands of milks;
lactase enzymes, available in drop or tablet form, that can be added
to milk before drinking; and lactase supplements, taken before a
lactose-rich meal.</TE>
<TE>   Some foods, however, should be completely avoided; condensed and
evaporated milks, for instance, contain twice the lactose of standard
milk.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a good idea to become a label sleuth. Because lactose
provides good texture, binds water and acts as carrier for color, it
is widely used in the food industry and is found added to many baked
and processed foods. These can include anything from bread and
cookies, cold cuts and hot dogs, salad dressings and sauces to drink
mixes, dry cereals, ice cream and lasagna.</TE>
<TE>   The key to coping with lactose intolerance is to remember that for
most people it does not mean a life without milk. After some initial
trial and error, it is a relatively straightforward food intolerance
to manage successfully.</TE>

<HD>An Activist Demonstrates His Faith in Blake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am at lunch with Jerry Rubin, talking about Robert Blake.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin is saying, "He couldn't have done it, no way! The man I knew
wouldn't kill anyone!"</LD>
<LD>   He is so worked up about it, he can hardly eat his scrambled
eggs--which is rare for the 58-year-old activist. If there is
anything Rubin loves, it is peace, happiness, Mother Earth and food.</LD>
<TE>   I am meeting with him because he had telephoned earlier to say he
knew Blake well from nuclear protests and peace marches and couldn't
believe he was a murderer. The actor is charged with killing his
wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, last May.</TE>
<TE>   What riled Rubin in the first place, he is telling me in no
uncertain terms, is the way the media are covering the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They've convicted him without a trial," he says between bites. He
has a tendency to shout because of a hearing problem and because, I
suspect, he just likes noise.</TE>
<TE>   I have known Rubin for almost 20 years. He has been in the
forefront of just about every social movement that has passed our
way, demanding disarmament, fasting for peace, challenging
established laws and going to jail when he's had to.</TE>
<TE>   He can be a fist-shaking, hell-raising pain in the conscience when
he's turned on, an orator of the old school, full of bombast and
outrage; and on this particular day, he is turned on. He sees Blake
as a man of peace, not a man who would put a bullet into anyone's
brain.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad about this," Rubin says, taking another bite. "Real
bad."</TE>
<TE>   He first met Blake in 1981 at a demonstration protesting the
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo County. Blake
led a contingent of protesters ashore on rubber rafts at Avila Beach
to penetrate the nuclear compound. Rubin was part of a human blockade
at the main gate, barring the entry of workers to the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were arrested and dragged away by sheriff's deputies
while demonstrators danced and sang the "Hokey Pokey." Later, Blake
apologized to Sheriff George Whiting for calling him fat and for
mocking the other officers during his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The man who had risen to fame as the cockatoo-wielding undercover
cop Baretta had suddenly acquired a new reputation as an activist for
liberal causes. A year after the Diablo Canyon event, he was in the
forefront of a protest in Dana Point against the San Onofre nuclear
plant. So was Rubin.</TE>
<TE>   "Robert didn't want to be a star," Rubin says in a tone that does
not invite debate. "He was a regular guy who believed in what he was
doing--not an actor after publicity."</TE>
<TE>   It was a phrase Blake used at the start of the 1986 cross-country
Great Peace March.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thrilled to death that the regular folks came out, the same
people who stopped the war in Vietnam," he announced to the gathered
media. "These are American straights, the real people."</TE>
<TE>   When the march, suddenly bereft of funding, began to die in the
Mojave Desert, it was Blake who kept up morale, Rubin says, wearing
the Great Peace March T-shirt he had worn back then. About 1,200
people had begun the march in L.A., but after its backers declared
bankruptcy, 700 went home.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked for a circle of unity among those who were still there,"
Rubin says. "We were holding hands in the desert silence when Robert
began singing 'Amazing Grace' and leading us into a tightening
circle. It was beautiful. We all cheered afterward and were more
determined than ever, thanks to Robert, that we'd make it
cross-country for peace."</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin says Blake was a peacemaker, and a small stack of news clips
also says he was a peacemaker, raising money in Las Vegas and
Washington, D.C., to get at least some of the marchers to their
destination. Blake went partway, Rubin went the distance, as did
about 400 others.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Blake also helped raise money for medical supplies and food
for victims of El Salvador's civil war. And he made an Orange County
newspaper columnist cry by delivering an eloquent tribute to a
legendary antiwar crusader, Tim Carpenter, who was suffering from
degenerative arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin finishes up his scrambled eggs, leans across the table and
says, "How could they even think a guy like that could kill someone?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure he expected an answer from me. He left saying he had
already called Blake's lawyer, Harland Braun, to offer his moral
support and was going to round up some of the other peace activists
to hold a rally on Blake's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   All I said to Rubin was that I didn't know if Blake was guilty of
anything but being a mediocre actor, and I wasn't going to speculate
on the rest. He's got a long road ahead of him called due process,
and at the end of that road, a jury's likely to figure out if he
killed Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   But I do know that there are dark places in the soul that often
conceal murderous intentions. Whether intentions festered within
Blake, the peacemaker, is something we've got to wait to find out.
But find out we will. And you can take that to the bank.</TE>

<HD>A Hot Rodder's  Wild Ride</HD>
<DH>It's a long, hard road from dream car to reality--and it's
an expensive trip. Ask Mark Christensen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Give up the dream. Collect $90,000.</LD>
<LD>   That was the option facing Long Beach writer and car enthusiast
Mark Christensen several years into his decade-long pursuit to build,
from scratch, the coolest car ever made.</LD>
<LD>   Christensen had teamed in 1990 with Nick Pugh, "the best car
designer of his generation," and a succession of expert fabricators
to create the 600-horsepower, natural gas-powered Xeno III. It was to
be the ultimate hot rod that he'd failed to create as a teenager
tinkering in his dad's garage in an upper-middle-class suburb of
Portland, Ore., in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   Then things got complicated. And expensive. Pugh, whose influence
can be seen in the bladelike diagonal lines of Ford's "New Edge"
designs such as the Focus, which break from the popular rounded look,
and the Toyota Celica sport coupe, is a perfectionist. He wanted
every nut and strut of the Xeno III finished like jewelry.
Christensen approved. "In our butt-first-into-the-future,
retro-obsessed age," he says, "Nick Pugh is trying to create
something really new."</TE>
<TE>   This was important to Christensen, 53, who says he grew up with
the promise of a future in which people would drive rockets, live in
circular glass houses and "be smoking pot on Mars by now." He laments
that future's failure to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   But the downside of Pugh's unwillingness to compromise was that
costs rose exponentially. Christensen, who has written about the car
in his recently published "Build the Perfect Beast: The Quest to
Design the Coolest Car Ever Made" (Thomas Dunne), says the project
began when a physician friend offered to back it with $100,000-- a
sum that, he realized later, might "buy the front bumper" for one of
the exotic designs that Pugh, only 21 at the outset, envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Xeno III cost about $600,000 to build, Christensen
says, even though key parts--including the 502-cubic-inch big-block
Chevy "Rat" engine--were donated.</TE>
<TE>   "Building the Perfect Beast" consists of two interlocking stories.
One, a black comedy, is about the scramble for money, the wooing of
individual and corporate sponsors, the trying out and discarding of
ideas--including a plan to have the car run on hydrogen "cracked"
from ordinary tap water--and the clash of outsized egos.</TE>
<TE>   The second story, more poignant, is about Christensen's life. The
son of a distinguished Portland eye surgeon, athlete and businessman
who "had the best cars of his time," Christensen was, like his
hot-rodding friends, part of "a West Coast generation who grew up
under an incredible lack of oppression," he says, quoting fellow
writer Charlie Haas.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we could do anything," he explains. "Nobody ever said
no to us--until we were arrested, or killed."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Xeno III project--similar in complexity to
constructing "a 15-foot-long Swiss watch"--cost Christensen his
Portland house, his beloved old Porsche and, because of the delays,
his original book contract. His publisher sued to recover the $50,000
advance.</TE>
<TE>   At the low point, Christensen says, one of the natural gas
companies that initially looked promising as a partner turned off the
gas in the home his family was renting in Long Beach's Belmont Shore
district.</TE>
<TE>   That's when temptation beckoned. Out of kindness, one of his
wealthier partners offered him $90,000 for his shares in the project.</TE>
<TE>   If he took it, he could pay his bills. And he could claim that he
had made progress on his journey from "spoiled son" to "responsible
father"--his book's second subject. Christensen and his wife,
interior decorator Deborah Wenner, have two children, Katie, 21, and
Matt, 14.</TE>
<TE>   But he wouldn't be proving himself "grown up enough to finish what
I'd started." And that, he thought, wouldn't have pleased his late
dad.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd taken it," Christensen says, "I'd be a lot less happy than
I am."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, at crunch time, supported him. And then funds poured in
unexpectedly because one of his partners, businessman John Case,
developed patents on an unrelated project, the storage of natural gas
in a vehicle's chassis, giving a van a potential 1,000-mile range.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Pugh, a former wunderkind at the Art Center College of
Design in Pasadena, began to make big money selling ideas to movie
studios. Meanwhile, Christensen, who began his writing career as a
freelance journalist and now has novels and works of nonfiction to
his credit, got a contract to write a book on the scientific quest
for "secular immortality"--humankind's efforts to live ever longer.</TE>
<TE>   The car was finished last winter and is on display at So-Cal Speed
Shop in Pomona, where it was built, a shrine to the hot rodder's art
where one can also see gleaming show cars and a racer made from a
plane's belly tank that hit 136 mph on a dry lake bed in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   The Xeno III "has no skin," Christensen says, at least, not in the
traditional sense of a car's outer covering. It has parts piercing
through its outer layer and some portions of the covering are made of
glass. "And, with its big, high-pressure fuel tanks and trapezoids of
tubing, [it] looks like a cross between a bomb-laden, streamlined
jungle gym and a chunk of the Mir space station," he adds. In short,
like no other car on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   It's for sale too, he says, for $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   How fast is the Xeno III? Fast enough to take off and fly,
Christensen figures. Fast enough, at any rate, to meet the project's
original specifications: a) Step on the gas. b) Hit the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Christensen hasn't driven it faster than 60 mph. At 6-foot-3,
he can hardly fit in it after crawling into the cockpit--the Xeno III
has no doors.</TE>
<TE>   But he's happy, he says, and so is Pugh. They're still friends.
"After the project was finished," Christensen recalls, "we went out
with a bunch of people and had about a million drinks and I was
delighted, after all we went through."</TE>
<TE>   And yes, he says, he'd do it again.</TE>

<HD>Depression Can Blind Women to Others' Supportiveness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About twice as many women as men suffer from depression, according to
National Institutes of Mental Health statistics. For many women, the
first episode of depression or dysphoria--which includes bouts of
anxiety, irritability and depression--strikes in the delicate
transition from adolescence to adulthood.</LD>
<LD>   Though the compassion and support of loved ones can soften the
devastating blows of depression, two studies suggest that depression
in adolescent girls and young women can obliterate their ability to
experience and benefit from the much needed support offered by best
friends and family.</LD>
<LD>   Shannon E. Daley, assistant professor of psychology at USC, and
Constance Hammen, professor of psychology at UCLA, studied
differences between adolescent friendships and romantic relationships
in the lives of 138 girls and women, age 16 to 19, from middle-class
neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. Seven times, over a five-year
period, the researchers tracked and assessed the depressed girls, as
well as their boyfriends and best friends, according to the study
published in the February issue of the Journal of Consulting and
Clinical Psychology.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers found that while best friends reported
intensifying support, love and empathy as the friend's depression
worsened, the depressed teenager did not perceive the efforts as
support or empathy.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, with boyfriends who admitted to often being
unsupportive and cold during depressive episodes, the depressed
teenagers' perceptions appeared to be more accurate.</TE>
<TE>   A number of studies show that for people with mental health
problems, the perception of support may be more important than actual
support. In fact, experts say, skewed perception is a natural
outgrowth of depression.</TE>
<TE>   "The friends of depressed girls said they provided increased
support, listened to the person's problems and provided reassurance,
love and affection" as the girl became more depressed, said Daley,
lead author of the study. "Best friends may really be telling the
truth and providing more support, but if the depressed women don't
see it, they may not benefit."</TE>
<TE>   "When people are depressed, they look at the world through
gray-colored glasses," said Gina Rayfield, a counseling psychologist
in Randolph, N.J., who specializes in adolescent development and
practices. "The depressed adolescent is not picking up on the cues of
support from their best friends. They tend to project their feelings
of 'I am not good enough,' onto others, and the assumption is
everyone else must be thinking that too."</TE>
<TE>   As for boyfriends, Rayfield said that many adolescent boys she
sees in her practice "are not keenly aware of their own feelings" and
are not developmentally mature enough to be supportive of a depressed
girlfriend. Many of the depressed young women in the study were in
dysfunctional relationships with partners who were aloof, cold,
volatile and anxious.</TE>
<TE>   "Depressed girls are more likely to pick boyfriends who are bad
for them," Daley said. "We don't know why yet."</TE>
<TE>   What is clear from the research, Daley said, is that as depressed
girls make the transition from adolescence to adulthood, it is in
their best interest to maintain close female friendships, because
that is where they stand the best chance of receiving emotional
support and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "Depressed women should also be aware of the kinds of
partners they are choosing,'' Daley said. "They may be choosing the
very partner who won't be there for them."</TE>
<TE>   In another study on the topic, psychologists examined the
relationships of 55 depressed, college-age women who were rated as
holding extremely high expectations of their loved ones (under the
label "other-oriented relationship perfectionism'').</TE>
<TE>   In their report, published in the March issue of the Journal of
Social and Clinical Psychology, Scott B. McCabe, an associate
professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo in Ontario,
Canada, and Robyn E. Wiebe, a University of Waterloo graduate student
found that depressed women often have such extreme expectations of
how people should treat them that they became hostile, angry,
frustrated and irritable when loved ones fall short, no matter how
sympathetically they are treated.</TE>
<TE>   "Relationship perfectionism in depressed women is linked to
hostility and irritability in interpersonal relationships," said
McCabe, who said the study was the first to explore the effects of
perfectionism in interpersonal relationships. The study was an
outgrowth of McCabe's clinical work in psychiatric hospitals, where
he noticed some depressed female inpatients would return from
weekends home enraged, disappointed and hostile.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe offers the case of one such inpatient, a depressed woman in
her 30s: "Her family had really cleaned up the house, and they had
put flowers on the table for her," recounted McCabe. "But they had
tickets for a sporting event that night [that] she didn't want to
attend. She wanted to be with them in the way she expected. She was
very angry and quite upset."</TE>
<TE>   This study focused on women, because depression is so much more
prevalent among females, McCabe said, although it isn't clear whether
the depression is triggered by high expectations of friends and
family, or if the condition triggers such unusually high
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe said an investigation is underway into whether or not the
link between depression and relationship perfectionism also applies
to men, but analysis of the results hasn't begun yet.</TE>
<TE>   The findings of these two studies on depressed women are hardly
surprising. "No one is very happy in a relationship where one person
is depressed," McCabe said, adding that rates of marital satisfaction
are lower for both partners in couples where one is depressed.</TE>
<TE>   For the non-depressed, there is considerable frustration
when their demonstrations of compassion are met with hostility and
anger, or simply go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   By studying young depressed women, psychologists such as Daley and
McCabe hope to find effective treatments. It is especially crucial to
find ways to help young depressed women as they move into adulthood,
Daley said, a delicate time when important decisions are being made
that can shape the outcome of their life.</TE>
<TE>   "Young people often make important decisions during this phase of
life, including choices about going to college or not, picking a
career, picking a spouse or a long-term romantic partner, and
parenthood," Daley said. "These decisions have long-reaching
ramifications and often can't easily be undone."</TE>

<LD>SURVIVAL CITY</LD>
<LD>   Adventures Among</LD>
<LD>   the Ruins of Atomic America</LD>
<TE>   By Tom Vanderbilt</TE>
<TE>   Princeton Architectural Press</TE>
<TE>   224 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When journalist Tom Vanderbilt (author of "The Sneaker Book: An
Anatomy of an Industry and an Icon") set out on his tour of disused
fallout shelters, bunkers, missile sites and other architectural
artifacts of the Cold War, he approached his quest somewhat in the
spirit of an archeologist from a future age looking back in wonder on
the ingenious, awe-inspiring, frightening and fantastic inventions of
some distant, bygone civilization. That chapter of history seemed
closed.</TE>
<TE>   But not long thereafter, as he headed into Manhattan to go over
plans for the design of his finished book, two airplanes struck the
towers of the World Trade Center. Suddenly, as he tells us in his
"Postscript: September 11, 2001," he felt as if he'd entered the
eerie, terrifying realm portrayed in the 1950s nuclear war pulp
novels he'd been reading as part of his research. For, although the
threat of planet-destroying warfare has receded, we are still living
at a time when cities are targets for mass destruction. Once again, a
condition of war, defensive alertness and pervasive anxiety coexists
with a general state of peace and business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   To so many of us who agonized about the dangers of the Cold War
military buildup, it seemed almost inevitable that so much
preparation for war could only lead to war. Yet that is not what
happened. The parallels people drew between the Soviet-American arms
race and the arms race among pre-World War I European powers did not
hold true. Indeed, it is possible to come to the opposite conclusion:
that being prepared for war is what saved us from war. But this, too,
may be an oversimplification.</TE>
<TE>   The conclusions that Vanderbilt offers are, as he puts it,
"tentative." "As the Cold War and its relics are buried," he muses,
"we should remember one of its enduring architectural lessons: There
is no safety in walls." In fact, however, the kind of ambitious Cold
War efforts made to counter the threat of the unthinkable that are
recounted in his book might actually make more sense now in the face
of a more limited, if less theoretical, threat.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier times, as Vanderbilt reminds us, cities in some sense
were armed citadels, surrounded by walls to protect their citizens
from attacks, bastions of safety in a dangerous, war-torn landscape.
Even then, of course, they were vulnerable to siege and attack.
Vanderbilt cites architectural historian Lewis Mumford's belief that
"war was one of the city's 'lethal genes,' dominant in one epoch,
repressed in the next. Conflict was inscribed in its very structure."
But the destruction of Dresden and Berlin, Hiroshima and Nagasaki
made unmistakably, horrifyingly clear something much worse, something
that had been evident ever since the advent of aerial warfare: Modern
cities and their civilian populations had become military targets.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as far back as the 19th century, Vanderbilt points out,
aerial photography transformed landscape into panorama and, as early
as 1849, the Austrian army tried (albeit unsuccessfully, thank
goodness!) to subdue the city of Venice with bombs dropped from a hot
air balloon.</TE>
<TE>   America in the 1950s and 1960s, as Vanderbilt shows, rose to meet
this challenge, if not, perhaps, to really solve it. Although the
military spearheaded the drive to respond to the nuclear threat with
missiles, silos, bunkers, satellites and early-warning radar defense,
the streamlined, functional, defensive style became a prevalent mode
among architects and builders.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other countries (including both our putative foe, the
Soviet Union, and steadfastly neutral Sweden), the U.S. made
relatively little effort to defend the civilian populations of
cities. Although the Office of Civil Defense encouraged homeowners to
build fallout shelters, an astonishingly small number followed this
advice. While reinforced bunkers and silos were built to house
missiles, radar installations, military personnel and presidents,
other effects of Cold War thinking were less direct.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as bunkers were being built below the ground, architects
were endowing many ordinary, aboveground buildings with bunker-like
qualities: heavy concrete exteriors, scant window surface and
artificially lighted, climate-controlled interiors. Paradoxically, at
the same time, architects were covering other buildings with vast
sheets of glass (which, would, of course, be shattered by any kind of
bombing), almost as if in defiance of such dangers.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Vanderbilt sees the post-World War II growth of
the suburbs as part of the pattern of dispersal away from the
bull's-eye of the targeted city. Here, as elsewhere, he confines
himself to the realm of intelligent inference rather than launching
full-scale theories. Vanderbilt characterizes his enterprise as "an
inquiry about space and how it exists during war. It is about how war
defines space, and space defines war.... It is about spaces that are
off the map and spaces hidden in plain sight. It is about the dueling
sciences of protection and destruction in an age when war went from
being a marked event to an underlying condition, when the city went
from protective enclave to strategic target. It is about the quest to
find safety in the modern world and to express it in physical terms."</TE>
<TE>   Although chock-full of pointed observations and written in the
kind of sharp, vigorous style often associated with polemics,
"Survival City" is not an intensely polemical book. It is, however, a
genuinely engaging book, perhaps because the author is so skillful at
conveying his own sense of engagement to the reader.</TE>

<HD>Bullying, Girl-Style</HD>
<DH>They roll their eyes, gossip maliciously and turn on
friends. The destructive behavior long dismissed as harmless is
gaining attention.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The code is unwritten, a conspiracy among girls to turn on one of
their own. Secret pacts made among middle and high school girls to
ruin reputations, to humiliate--whisper campaigns that so-and-so
sleeps around; barking like a dog at another girl in the hallway;
shifting to exclude someone from her usual lunch spot.</LD>
<LD>   Such behavior goes on behind the backs of parents and teachers or
is dismissed as gossip or teasing, said Rachel Simmons, author of the
new book "Odd Girl Out: The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls"
(Harcourt). Finally, Simmons said, people are beginning to realize
that the covert aggression by girls has a name: bullying.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by Simmons' book and others, a wrenching and, some say,
unprecedented public discussion is underway on the subject of girls
and bullying. In public forums, often for the first time, girls--and
women--are stepping forward with stories about how they were bullied
or were bullies themselves. On national TV and Web sites, women are
confessing that they were mean to former schoolmates; some are trying
to track down their victims and offer apologies.</LD>
<TE>   The sudden openness is reminiscent of the way that women first
began talking publicly about domestic violence 20 years ago, said
Holly Nishimura, assistant director of the Ophelia Project. (Simmons
is a national trainer for the Pennsylvania-based organization, which
works on anti-bullying programs. The group, which started in 1997,
came out of local discussions about Mary Pipher's book, "Reviving
Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls.")</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, some women hadn't even realized that the cruel
acts of their girlhood friends--or their own actions--could be
considered bullying. "We have a language and a name for it now,"
Nishimura said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, "Odd Girl Out" shot to No. 7 on Amazon.com's sales
rankings. The week before, during a discussion of the book on
television's "The Oprah Winfrey Show," a 40-ish woman acknowledged
that she had bullied childhood friends. The woman said she had paid
for her actions all of her life and hoped to track down the girls she
had mistreated 30 years ago to make amends. "I have very few friends
now," the woman said.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent National Public Radio program, a young mother from Los
Angeles called in to say, with a shaking voice, that she had bullied
a friend in summer camp, and, "Jennifer Willard, if you're out there,
I'm sorry." In early April, on a "Dateline NBC" segment featuring
Simmons' book, a 23-year-old woman confessed that she had been a
middle-school bully, saying she wanted other girls to learn from her
folly. (After being interviewed for Simmons' book, the woman decided
to contact her former eighth-grade friend and is trying to rebuild
their relationship.)</TE>
<TE>   Later that week, on the "Dateline NBC" Web site, hundreds of
thousands of people logged on to read or participate in an online
chat with Simmons, who, in her book, admitted that she had been both
a bully and a victim.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it speaks to a transformation that's happening in what
people feel they can say--that people feel suddenly that certain
things are able to be said," said Simmons, 27, in a telephone
interview. "That's a sign of an issue that has been previously not
validated, that's gaining a kind of public legitimacy."</TE>
<TE>   The way girls relate to one another--how they exclude, how to be a
good friend--is considered important enough to be included in the
human-development curriculum at Marlborough School in Los Angeles,
said Emily Sears Vaughn, a counselor at the all-girls school. As part
of the curriculum, advisors select and train 11th-grade students to
lead small discussion groups of seventh-grade girls on topics such as
cliques and bullying.</TE>
<TE>   "When I have a problem with friends," said Vanessa Van Petten, 16,
"I can't focus on my studies. Friends are a big deal. I think it's so
important that our school lets us feel they are a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   The juniors urge the younger girls to be direct and confront
friends who give them the cold shoulder. "If something is bothering
you, say it: 'Is there a reason you didn't say hi to me?'" Vanessa
tells her group.</TE>
<TE>   In middle school, girls are hyper-sensitive to small slights and
what such actions mean to their place in the social structure, said
Casey Schuur, 16. For instance, said Casey, a seventh-grader might
say in the group: "'Someone didn't let me have some of her cake for
their birthday. What was that about?' You can't really go up to your
mom, like, 'Mom, Janie didn't give me some of her cake.'"</TE>
<TE>   Sixth- and seventh-grade girls are scared to confront, and
possibly aggravate, friends who hurt them, Vanessa said. "It's fear
of not having friends or walking down the hallway alone or having
your lunch and not having a group to go to."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons began studying female bullying and the psychology of girls
three years ago in graduate school at Oxford University. A Rhodes
scholar who lives in Brooklyn, she interviewed more than 300 girls
between ages 10 and 14 during prime bullying years.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons got an early hint of how "Odd Girl Out" would resonate
with women while she was writing it. "Everywhere I went, there was an
immediate outpouring of support, of personal storytelling, of 'It's
about time. You go, girl!'" she said. "[At] grocery stores, hair
salons, there was just this, 'Oh, yes, yes' connection. It hit a
nerve and since the book has come out [last month], pretty amazing
things have happened."</TE>
<TE>   "Odd Girl Out" is one of a slew of books out this year on the
intricate social circles of girls and the ways in which they can
manipulate and scheme to wield power or seek revenge. In "Fast Girls"
(Scribner), journalist Emily White wrote about girls who were labeled
"sluts" in high school and how rumors about their sex lives forced
them into intense isolation or worse. And in "Queen Bees &amp; Wannabes"
(Crown Publishers), author Rosalind Wiseman addressed the structure
of cliques and the ringleaders who reign supreme over the other
girls.</TE>
<TE>   The books build on research focusing on girls and aggression that
began only 10 years ago. In one study, a University of Minnesota
research team concluded that girls can be just as aggressive as boys,
but in different ways. Boys tend to lash out physically; girls--who
are socialized to avoid direct confrontation--strike via "relational
aggression," such as ending a friendship by badmouthing the person
behind her back, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The subtle ways that girls bully are hard to detect, Simmons said.
But the body language is unmistakable: eye rolling, finger pointing,
a turned back.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, female victims, as well as the bullies themselves,
can suffer from enduring low self-esteem, depression and may even
commit suicide, Simmons noted. But the behavior of girls has been
largely overlooked in the public discourse on bullies that took off
three years ago after two teenage boys opened fire at Columbine High
School in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Wiseman, the 33-year-old author of "Queen Bees," is invited to
speak to classrooms and to groups of adults that include fathers,
male CEOs and women who have kept their girlhood pain to themselves
for decades. "Seventy-year-old women can recount for me the mean
things that happened in seventh-grade like it was yesterday, just
like a 12-year-old--and it's the same stuff," said Wiseman,
co-founder of the Empower Program in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   As president of the nonprofit group, which works with youth on
programs against physical and verbal violence, Wiseman has been
speaking about the behavior of girls for 10 years. But until
recently, she found it hard to persuade schools to let her talk to
students. Last year, Wiseman had about 100 speaking requests; in the
last three months, the number jumped to 500. Still, she sometimes has
to explain why the gossip of girls deserves attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I would say to people who say this is no big deal is,
'Yeah but, if your kid is sitting in math class, and if she's being
called a slut, she's not thinking about math,'" Wiseman said. "'She's
thinking about where she's going to sit at lunch today.' So it really
contributes to cultures in schools."</TE>
<TE>   Rumors are spreading faster than ever these days via means like
online bulletin boards, Simmons pointed out. In March, for instance,
www.schoolrumors.com was shut down by its service provider after
gaining notoriety as a Web site where students--particularly in the
San Fernando Valley--posted messages calling girls "sluts" or
"whores" or accusing their peers of engaging in sexual acts.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, school administrators are beginning to expand
their definitions of bullying to include nonphysical aggression. In
the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, for instance, students are
not allowed to spread rumors, glare or take other actions meant to
intimidate or harass, according to an anti-bullying policy that took
effect this school year. Administrators will look at patterns of
behavior to see whether an incident of eye rolling, for instance,
could be part of a bullying campaign against someone, said Asst.
Supt. Jaime Castellanos.</TE>
<TE>   A redefinition of bullying would let girls know that it's wrong
when a peer stares her down or purposely elbows her in the hallway,
Simmons said. "Girls often don't report it," she said. "They don't
feel like anyone will believe them. They know there are no rules
against it."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons never reported the time when she was bullied at age 8. A
friend, Abby, persuaded Simmons' best friend to dump her and the rest
of her gang to run when they saw her. In her books, Simmons also
wrote about how she took part in a bullying campaign in the
ninth-grade against her close friend, with whom she recently met for
drinks and hashed out what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I have indulged in the knowledge of a shared secret, in eyes
locking exclusively with someone else's, or rolling in furtive
annoyance," Simmons wrote. "I have gossiped. I have relished that
rush of inclusion at the expense of an odd girl out. Have you?"</TE>

<LD>Drawing in 3-D</LD>
<LD>   How do artists make flat drawings and paintings appear so lifelike
and full of dimension? They draw in "3-D," which is short for the
three dimensions of height, width and depth. Three-dimensional
drawing uses tricks and techniques to make a flat picture appear not
so flat.</LD>
<LD>   Artist Mark Kistler says anyone age 7 and older can learn to draw
in 3-D. He suggests learning the "12 Renaissance words" that help
explain the tricks that artists use to make their drawings more real.</LD>
<TE>   Here are five of the words to help you understand how to draw in
3-D.</TE>
<TE>   * Size: If you want something to look far away, draw it small. To
make it look close, draw it big.</TE>
<TE>   * Shading: Add darkness to the side of an object that faces away
from your light source, a lamp or the sun. Shading is the most
powerful way to create the illusion of depth.</TE>
<TE>   * Overlapping: Draw an object behind another object to make it
look deeper in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   * Horizon: Draw a line all the way across your page behind the
objects in your drawing. The horizon is an imaginary line where the
sky seems to meet the earth.</TE>
<TE>   * Practice: Draw whenever and wherever you can using the
"Renaissance words."</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about drawing in 3-D and how art relates to reading,
writing and mathematics, watch "Mark Kistler's Imagination Station"
this Friday at 10:30 a.m. on KLCS-TV. In Friday's episode, Mark will
show you how to draw Cecelia, a gorilla who wants to play chess. You
can also visit www.draw3d.com.</TE>

licensed to the Los Angeles Unified School District. It is broadcast
over the air on Channel 58 and is available through most cable
companies and selected satellite television systems.</TE>

<TE>   "Sea Otters"</TE>
<TE>   by Beth Wagner Brust</TE>
<TE>   Sea otters are cuddly looking, playful and just plain adorable.
Can you believe that these friendly faced animals were once hunted
and were almost extinct?</TE>
<TE>   The fur on a sea otter is thicker than a dog's. Some otters have
almost a billion hairs on their bodies. They spend much time grooming
themselves. The spine of a sea otter is so flexible that they can
bend their body backward and forward in a complete circle.</TE>
<TE>   A funny fact about sea otters is that the outside toe is the
biggest and the inside toe is the smallest. This way they can spread
their toes wider to help them swim.</TE>
<TE>   Sea otters use tools to eat like we use forks and knives. They use
rocks to crack open shellfish. They like to eat their food by placing
it on their tummies while swimming. Read this book to learn more.</TE>

<LD>Classical music played soothingly as Riley the golden retriever was
whisked by private limo (OK, van) to LAX for his Air New Zealand
flight to Auckland. From there, it would be on to Christchurch where,
after 30 days in quarantine, he will join owner Ann Weatherford in
their new home.</LD>
<LD>   Riley's travel agent? Kennel Club LAX, one of the pet transport
specialists nationwide who each year try to make the skies a little
friendlier for the estimated 60,000 animals--dogs, cats, reptiles,
birds, fish and assorted others--that fly domestically, as well as
internationally, each month.</LD>
<LD>   Agencies with names such as Jet-A-Pet, Paws Around the World and
Happy Tails Travel are in business to handle ticketing and paperwork,
and generally minimize stress for pet owners dealing with the double
trauma of moving and shipping their beloveds as cargo.</LD>
<TE>   Pet transport professionals, while not always able to calm anxious
pet lovers, do help the situation by making flight arrangements,
schlepping the animal to a vet for its checkup, getting permits for
international travel and making quarantine facility reservations
where necessary. Most will pick the pet up, deliver it to the airport
and, at the other end, to the owner's new residence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a no-worry situation," says James O'Brien of
Burlingame-based O'Brien Animal Transportation Services and president
of the Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Assn., whose
100-plus member companies are involved in the handling, boarding and
moving of small animals. "A lot of people don't know how to do this,
a lot don't have time. Say they're relocating and they have two or
three children, a bird, a cat and a dog and they're moving their
furniture. They turn the pets over to a professional shipper and they
know the animal will be cared for."</TE>
<TE>   So what does convenience cost? There is a coordination fee plus
the per-pound charges levied by airlines. There is a fee for boarding
the pet overnight, which often is recommended to help calm preflight
jitters and acclimate him to his traveling crate. O'Brien offers
"guesstimates" for a dog being shipped across country "with all the
trimmings": $800 to $1,500 for a large dog, $800 for a medium-size
dog and $500 to $600 for a small dog.</TE>
<TE>   Price is determined not only by the size and weight of the animal
and crate, but by how many services are provided and how far the
animal is traveling. "I've seen tickets that are $3,000 and tickets
that are $100, like for sending a cat to Arizona," says Shoshana
Weissman, general manager of Kennel Club LAX.</TE>
<TE>   For the pet born with a silver bone in his mouth, there are other
options. San Francisco-based Lasco Intl.'s air charter division
recently sent a pair of Irish setters--and their handler--from San
Francisco to Honolulu in a Learjet. The flight, during which the dogs
roamed freely in the cabin and lounged on leather seats covered with
a fur rug, set the owner back about $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think more of their pet than they do of their
children," says Lasco founder Jack Maita. "We had one client who was
going to Europe and wanted her dog brought over. That was about
$80,000." The company has Learjets or Gulfstreams but, Maita says,
"If you want a 747, we'll provide it."</TE>
<TE>   Maita, whose clients include celebrities and Fortune 500 types,
isn't surprised that clients will pay from $1,300 to $7,500 an hour
to charter a pet jet. "You see how badly we [humans] are treated
upstairs" in a commercial plane, he observes.</TE>
<TE>   For those not breathing such rarified air, just a little TLC--and
someone else to handle the logistics--is the lure. When writer David
Mixner was relocating recently from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.,
his trio of cats were among his main concerns. "You hear the horror
tales of cats getting loose in the bodies of airplanes."</TE>
<TE>   On his vet's suggestion, he contacted Kennel Club LAX. "It saved
my life," he says. "This was such a relief, to have that stress
lifted from me." Yates, Geraldine and Uganda were picked up at his
home, boarded in the Kennel Club's designer kitty cottages, met at
the airport in Washington and delivered to Mixner's new apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "Yates is diabetic," he adds, "and they gave him his shots twice a
day, regulating it so when he was flying it wasn't too bad. They
shipped his insulin and needles with him. The cats were traumatized
by the move, but they arrived in great condition."</TE>
<TE>   Some pet transporters such as Kennel Club LAX, which also offers
long-term boarding, will coddle its short-term boarders preflight
with perks ranging from pedicures to massages.</TE>
<TE>   Weatherford, who owns Riley the retriever, admits she was "in
worse shape than he was" when she put Riley on a Denver to L.A.
flight on the first leg of his voyage to New Zealand. "The people who
need the sedation are the owners. I've never taken Valium, but all of
a sudden I wished I'd had one." She cried as he was boarded, even
though the airline was "very lovey-dovey and didn't treat him like a
box."</TE>
<TE>   A window designer, she is moving to Christchurch for a few years
to join her fiance--and there was no way she was leaving Riley
behind. In L.A., he stayed overnight at Kennel Club LAX and the next
day was delivered to the airport by driver Wayne Ashlock in one of
the club's whimsically decorated white vans. Once he turned on the
classical music, Ashlock says, Riley "just lay down and closed his
eyes," content in his crate with one of Weatherford's T-shirts, some
chew toys and a favorite ball.</TE>
<TE>   Those in the business have seen it all. Says Rosemary Filippelli
of Worldwide Pet Transport in New York, "I was just speaking with a
woman who has a whole slew of things--uromastyx, which are dragony
things, a king snake, four rats, a pet chameleon, 10 dragons, a
cockatiel and two Scotties" being moved from Atlanta to Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Just how do you ship a snake? "They go in a pet carrier. We put
them in pillowcases or burlap bags that they can breathe through.
They will usually just curl around" and stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "We do everything from aardvarks to zebras," O'Brien says. Has he
shipped either? Well, no--make that "fins, feathers, fur or fangs."
He has shipped elephants to zoos. (A 747 can accommodate two). "We
generally turn down animals we consider dangerous or vicious."</TE>
<TE>   "I've moved animals that I wouldn't touch myself," says Millie
Woolf, owner of Tampa-based Air Animal. She mentions tarantulas and
iguanas. Since she founded the pet transport association in 1979,
Woolf says, the industry has changed, shifting away from people
traveling with pets to those relocating. And, as laws have changed
and airlines have become more vigilant about pets, "It has become
harder and harder to just hop on a plane with a dog or cat."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, "There are a lot more inspections" under the
auspices of the federal Transportation Security Administration,
Filippelli says. "They want to make sure there's no bombs or anything
in the containers."</TE>
<TE>   Not all airlines accept pets from individuals and, even with those
that do, it's not as simple as walking up to the counter the day of
the flight and saying, "Here's Fido." If a pet is traveling abroad,
some countries require that the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture sign off on
the paperwork and seal the crate the day the animal is shipped. Once
sealed in, the pet is not allowed out until reaching its destination.
Even if the pet is traveling in the passenger cabin--some airlines
permit it and some don't--a health certificate, issued no more than
10 days before departure, is required. If the pet is going cargo,
things are a bit more complicated. Airline regulations differ, but on
average pets must be booked at least 10 days before the flight. And,
they must have airline-approved crates.</TE>
<TE>   With summer coming, "One of the issues is weather restrictions,"
Weissman says. Although the cargo area of a plane is temperature
controlled, the mercury can soar on the tarmac while a crated pet
waits to be loaded. Federal regulations prohibit leaving an animal
for more than 45 minutes on a tarmac where the temperature is above
85 degrees. That may mean booking an outrageously late or early
flight if the pet's bound for, say, Texas or Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Cipparrone has accommodated clients by cooking special
preflight pet meals and she recently shipped two tortoises to
Switzerland "with a container of deli fruit salad. They loved the
strawberries."</TE>
<TE>   On one thing everyone in the business seems agreed: No
tranquilizers. "They can have an adverse effect at high altitude,"
explains Filippelli, "like if you have a few drinks on a plane, you
get more of a buzz than you do on the ground." A tranquilized pet may
suffer stress-induced respiratory problems, become dehydrated from
excessive drooling, suffer balance problems in case of air turbulence
and is at risk of choking should it vomit because of impaired gag
reflex.</TE>
<TE>   No one touts flying as a pleasant experience for the pet, even
though airlines require that shipping crates be large enough to
permit pets to stand and turn. Says Filippelli, "I think cats
probably can stay in a container longer, but both cats and dogs want
to get out as quickly as possible--and I certainly don't blame them."</TE>
<TE>   Although cargo holds are pressurized and temperature controlled,
the Humane Society recommends transporting a pet by air only when
"absolutely necessary." It cites statistics from the Air Transport
Assn.: More than 5,000 animals die, are injured or lost on commercial
flights each year as a result of temperature extremes, poor
ventilation, oxygen deprivation and rough handling. But some people
have no choice--neither Amtrak nor Greyhound ships pets.</TE>
<TE>   Says Cipparrone: "Personally, I feel that five hours in an
airplane across country is probably better than five days in a car,
going into five different hotels, with the chance of the animal
getting lost--especially cats. That's not to say it isn't stressful.
Takeoff and landing is stressful for animals, just as it is for
people."</TE>

<HD>Trial of Andersen Will Begin Today</HD>
<DH>Courts: The outcome of the obstruction case could affect
the accounting firm's chances in civil lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen's accounting practice has been shredded almost as
thoroughly as the boxes of Enron Corp. audit documents it admitted
destroying.</LD>
<LD>   But there still is plenty on the line for the company--and the
federal government--as it heads into court today to combat an
obstruction of justice charge.</LD>
<LD>   A conviction probably would bar Andersen from auditing public
companies, ending the firm's chance for resurrection. An Andersen
acquittal, conversely, could set the fallen accounting giant on a
path to emerge as a smaller, audit-oriented practice and potentially
bolster its credibility in battling civil lawsuits arising from its
Enron audit.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department's credibility also is at stake. A loss in
the obstruction case would badly undermine prosecutors' momentum and
leverage in pursuing potential witnesses and defendants in its probe
of Enron--the main target of federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   A conviction "puts the fear into everyone else who comes in
contact with the investigation, and I think that was the point," said
Robert Plotkin, a Washington defense lawyer who specializes in
white-collar cases. "It shows that if you can do this to Andersen,
you can do this to anybody. If they were to lose, it would undermine
everything. The message becomes, 'We don't have the evidence. We're
not going to be able to scare you into cooperating.' But I think it's
going to be hard for Andersen to defeat these charges."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors will enter the courthouse this morning--just a few
blocks from Andersen's Houston office, the scene of the alleged
crime--essentially holding all the cards.</TE>
<TE>   David B. Duncan, the former Andersen partner who led the firm's
audit of Enron and later orchestrated a document-shredding frenzy in
the Houston office after learning of an SEC probe into the energy
giant, has agreed to testify for prosecutors. Duncan already has
pleaded guilty to a separate obstruction charge.</TE>
<TE>   His admission radically altered the dynamics of the case. Before
his plea, Andersen had been pushing for a quick trial--potentially
forcing prosecutors to take a case to a jury before they had time to
gather more evidence. In addition, Andersen believed that its best
hopes for survival lay in getting the criminal case resolved early.</TE>
<TE>   After Duncan admitted to obstruction, Andersen entered settlement
talks with the government and--when it became clear there would be no
deal--reversed its earlier position and asked for a delay in the
start of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston rejected the
firm's request. Harmon has said she wants the trial to close before
the end of May to avoid conflicting with her vacation plans. Jury
selection is expected to start today, and witnesses should begin
taking the stand by midweek.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, a 20-year veteran of the firm, was fired shortly after
Andersen admitted to the document destruction in January. As a
witness for the prosecution, he is expected to provide an account of
the chronology of events inside Andersen's sprawling operation.</TE>
<TE>   He also is expected to say that, contrary to Andersen's account,
the document destruction was sanctioned by high-level Andersen
executives. Duncan has said previously that his shredding campaign
followed an Oct. 12 e-mail from Nancy Temple, an Andersen attorney
based in the firm's Chicago headquarters, reminding employees of
document destruction policies.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the prosecutors may seek to show that numerous other
Andersen executives had become aware of internal problems at Enron in
the months before the destruction began.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Andersen executives--including the head of its U.S.
operations--participated in a February 2001 conference call with the
Houston office in which they discussed such issues as Enron's
aggressive deal-making and internal conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   And Andersen employees in Houston got warnings about accounting
troubles from Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's cooperation also gives the government an edge in the
legal and procedural battles that are expected to unfold. Case law
has generally determined that a company acts through its employees,
so Duncan's admission could be used to win a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution will be led by a three-lawyer team--Samuel Buell,
Andrew Weissmann and Matt Friedrich. Buell and Weissmann have
experience in prosecuting organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is expected to counter the government's case by arguing
that, in spite of the legal technicalities, Andersen management did
not have full knowledge of Duncan's actions. That argument marks a
return to Andersen's initial response to the shredding. In January,
Andersen portrayed Duncan as a renegade who undertook the shredding
on his own, then retreated from that position as it became clear he
might hold the keys to the case.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen officials have since said Duncan's plea--in which he
admitted destroying documents with the intent of keeping them from
the SEC--contradicted his earlier representations.</TE>
<TE>   Another component of the firm's defense is the argument that
Andersen has publicly proclaimed for weeks that the Justice
Department is unfairly threatening to ruin a firm of 28,000 employees
because of the actions of a few. Andersen is being represented by
veteran Texas attorney Rusty Hardin, a former prosecutor who has
proved adept at capitalizing on nuances of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin has said the firm's actions represented "a failure to
communicate. But not a crime."</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen can persuade a jury to see the distinction and acquit,
the firm may gain traction in its efforts to settle civil litigation
stemming from Enron's meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be, in effect, a mock jury for the civil cases," said
John Baker, a law professor at Louisiana State University.</TE>
<TE>   Though the outcome of the criminal trial has no legal bearing on a
civil case, an acquittal could provide Andersen with leverage in
persuading plaintiffs that the firm can continue operating in some
smaller form. Such an outcome would position the firm to reach
settlements that wouldn't bankrupt the company, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Andersen manages to pull out an acquittal, its
troubles would be far from over. The SEC could launch proceedings to
bar the firm from auditing the books of public companies. And
prosecutors could return to court and file different charges against
Andersen or individual partners.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor and SEC attorney, said the
indictment against Andersen on a single charge meant that "the
Department of Justice was exercising considerable restraint." He said
the government's actions so far--including convening a special grand
jury to examine the Enron case--means there "is a whole set of other
potential charges," including securities fraud, that could be brought
against the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Frenkel also said that by obtaining a quick indictment against the
firm and pursuing the trial instead of settling, prosecutors are
broadcasting a warning to potential Enron defendants.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they send a very clear message that they're serious about
this," he said. "There's much more to this than Andersen and David
Duncan."</TE>

<HD>Buffett Warns of Risk to Terror Insurers</HD>
<DH>Liability: Berkshire Hathaway's chairman, predicting more
attacks, says coverage could put heavily exposed companies out of
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL RIGBY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns one of the world's
largest reinsurers, said Sunday that many insurance firms are running
huge risks on the terrorism coverage they are selling, which could
put them out of business.</LD>
<LD>   "Many insurance companies are exposed to ruin" from policies
including terrorism coverage, Buffett said the day after Berkshire
Hathaway's annual meeting. He predicted that there will be more
terror attacks, possibly nuclear or biological, that would dwarf
losses from Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "It'll happen--in the next 10 minutes or the next 50 years," said
Buffett, who expects a nuclear or biological attack on the country at
some point.</LD>
<TE>   Buffett, whose reinsurance operations will pay out $2.4 billion of
the overall $40 billion or so of losses from the destruction of the
World Trade Center, renewed his call for the U.S. government to form
a terror insurance program to help pay for future terror losses. He
also called for insurance regulators to allow exclusions in policies
for damage from nuclear attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't quantifiable," Buffett said, describing the dangers of
underwriting terror risks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, Berkshire is providing some reinsurance
coverage--which insurance companies buy to limit their losses--but
said that all policies it takes on are strictly capped, so Berkshire
knows the maximum it will have to pay out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're selling more terrorism coverage than anybody," Buffett
said, "but it does not endanger Berkshire Hathaway."</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire, which owns General Re, the world's fourth-largest
reinsurer, and specialized large risk underwriter National Indemnity,
is in a better position than most to take on terror risk, as it has
huge amounts of investments to cover claims, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday
that his insurance and reinsurance operations had made a large profit
in the first quarter, after a long period of difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   He also warned that fraud and sloppy accounting were rife in
American business and that returns on stock investing probably would
be lower over the next few years than they have been.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see great results from our insurance businesses,"
Buffett told an estimated 10,000 shareholders at Omaha's Civic
Auditorium Saturday. Berkshire, whose main business is insurance, had
an operating loss last year as it was hammered by billions of dollars
in Sept. 11 insurance claims. It is now making up the ground as
premium rates soar.</TE>
<TE>   "He was more optimistic than we expected," Matt Sauer, a portfolio
manager at Oak Value Capital Management, told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   But elsewhere, Buffett, 71, and his longtime partner Charlie
Munger, 78, were less bullish on ways to make money, saying 6% to 7%
was a fair return on investments in the current low-interest-rate
environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more money than ideas," Buffett admitted, saying that
finding good investments was not easy. Berkshire, which has grown to
more than $110 billion in market value since Buffett took over in
1965, is always on the lookout for acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   "We wait for the fat pitch," said Buffett, mentioning that he may
be interested in buying firms in bankruptcy because of asbestos
problems, but only if all liabilities had been dealt with. Buffett
has said repeatedly that he needs a single $15-billion-or-so
acquisition to keep Berkshire growing.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the apparent spread of corporate fraud in the light of
recent meltdowns, Buffett said he and Munger had so far avoided being
fooled, but he had seen plenty of frauds in public U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the crooks look like crooks," Buffett said. "Wall Street
loves them as long as they are pushing out securities."</TE>
<TE>   Looking out for those who use EBITDA numbers is a good start in
spotting frauds, Buffett said, referring to a style of financial
reporting made popular by loss-making Internet firms that discount
interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and other one-time items
from results. "They are either conning you or themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several Berkshire shareholders, from as far away as Hong Kong and
South Africa, quizzed Buffett on his investing technique.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no single metric I can give you that tells you now is a
good time to buy stocks," Buffett told one shareholder, who asked
what calculations he should make to evaluate stocks. "People always
want a formula; it doesn't work that way."</TE>
<TE>   The only way to value a stock, or a company, he said, is to
estimate what cash a business will throw off over the course of its
life, work out the value of that cash now, and buy it for less. "A
great IQ is not needed to do well as an investor," Buffett said. What
is needed is the "ability to detach yourself from the crowd."</TE>

<HD>Bias Suit Against Del Taco Broadens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadening their legal complaint against Del Taco Inc., several
former African American employees are accusing the nation's
second-largest Mexican fast-food chain of discriminating against
black prospective job candidates in favor of Latinos and of ignoring
complaints about the hiring of undocumented Latino workers.</LD>
<LD>   In March, one current and six former African American workers
filed a civil suit against the Laguna Hills-based firm accusing it of
turning a blind eye to Latino employees mistreating African Americans
because of their race. On Friday, new charges were added to the
lawsuit, along with two additional black plaintiffs.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems the more we investigate, the more troubling the
situation appears," plaintiffs' attorney James Urbanic said.</LD>
<TE>   In a written statement, closely held Del Taco called the
litigation a "great surprise" but declined to elaborate. The chain
has 395 restaurants in 10 states.</TE>
<TE>   Rochelle Manuel, a former cashier who is African American,
witnessed a Latina supervisor at a Cypress Del Taco refuse to give
job applications to blacks or take completed ones from them, the suit
said. The black applicants were told the restaurant wasn't hiring,
while the Latina manager routinely gave applications and even jobs to
Latinos, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, a Del Taco human resources consultant failed
to respond to African American employees' complaints that the company
was hiring illegal immigrants, the suit said. Instead of launching an
investigation, the company retaliated against some of the African
American workers by firing them, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service would not say whether
it is investigating Del Taco for immigration violations. The agency
does not discuss ongoing investigations, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks unspecified damages, including lost wages, punitive
damages and reinstatement.</TE>

<HD>Gasoline Prices Holding Steady</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. gasoline prices held steady over the last two weeks despite
looming higher fuel demand from summer vacationers and Iraq's embargo
on oil exports, according to the Lundberg nationwide service station
survey released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The average for self-serve regular eased about a third of a cent
to $1.4211 a gallon in the two weeks ended May 3, bringing prices a
hefty 30 cents below their level last year when a supply crunch
before summer caused a record spike, according to the survey.</LD>
<LD>   "Supplies of both crude oil and gasoline are sufficient to meet
demand right now," said Trilby Lundberg, editor of the survey. "Pump
prices have fallen nearly 1 cent in a month, and this is despite
supply disruptions from Iraq and a few weeks ago from Venezuela."</LD>
<TE>   Iraq said Sunday that it had decided to end its ban and resume
exports of about 2 million barrels a day. The suspension was in
protest of Israel's incursions into Palestinian-controlled areas of
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a brief disruption last month in crude oil and
gasoline exports from No. 4 supplier Venezuela due to a labor dispute
at the state oil company and protests against President Hugo Chavez,
culminating in a failed coup.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices normally rise in late spring due to increased fuel
consumption from travelers and as a seasonal switch to
harder-to-produce clean air gasoline blends mandated at a third of
the nation's pumps by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The highest gasoline prices were seen in San Francisco at $1.6353
a gallon, while the lowest were seen in Atlanta at $1.2267 a gallon,
according to the survey.</TE>

<HD>Outlook for IT Jobs Seen Improving</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The outlook for hiring in information technology jobs--one of the
hardest hit sectors in last year's downturn--was starting to improve
even as the national unemployment rate touched its highest level in
more than 7 1/2 years, a report released today said.</LD>
<LD>   Hiring managers report they will attempt to fill 1.1 million
information technology jobs in the next 12 months, according to the
report by the Information Technology Assn. of America industry group.</LD>
<LD>   If that estimate is on target, the information technology job
market is in the midst of a significant recovery after a sharp
contraction last year. "If just half of these jobs are filled, the
size of the IT work force will be restored to pre-2001 levels," the
trade group said in its report.</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, the U.S. information technology work force shrank 5%,
dropping to 9.9 million workers and reflecting the effects of the
economic downturn and a near halt to new spending on corporate
computer systems, ITAA said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, spending on computer and communication products
and services grew less than 1%, to $813 billion last year--far slower
than the average 8% growth over the prior three years.</TE>
<TE>   For growth to come back in related jobs in a meaningful way,
corporate investment needs to start to recover now as well, the
Arlington, Va.-based group said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're coming out of a recession, and the lock that's been on IT
spending over the last 12 months is beginning to become unlocked,"
ITAA President Harris Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate jumped to 6% in April, the highest
level since August 1994 as job seekers returned to the market faster
than U.S. companies added new positions.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq said Sunday it had decided to resume oil exports after
suspending deliveries to protest Israel's incursion into Palestinian
territory.</LD>
<LD>   "It was decided to resume oil pumping after the expiry of the
one-month period, which means [Wednesday]," Iraqi television said in
a statement following a cabinet meeting chaired by President Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Iraq suspended all oil exports totaling about 2 million barrels a
day on April 8 to protest Israel's military offensive in the West
Bank, and it called on other oil-producing states to follow suit.
None so far has taken similar action.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, the cabinet criticized other Arab producers for
not following Iraq's lead: "The decision did not find positive
response from brethren Arabs who possess the oil and who should have
taken similar steps in line with the Iraqi initiative to make it
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's state oil marketer SOMO was sending customers official
confirmation of the export resumption and asking them to sign up for
crude loadings this month.</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad exports oil in a food-for-oil swap, an exception to United
Nations sanctions imposed in 1990 as a punishment for Iraq's invasion

<HD>Off-the-Books Jobs Growing in Region</HD>
<DH>Labor: Lax enforcement and illegal immigration are among
factors fueling underground economy, study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While most of the Los Angeles economy has stagnated since the last
recession, one segment is booming, a new analysis contends. The
problem is, it's all underground.</LD>
<LD>   Cash-pay, off-the-books work is thriving in the region, fed by new
business practices, illegal immigration and lax labor law
enforcement, according to the Economic Roundtable, a Los Angeles
research group. That keeps thousands of low-skilled workers employed,
but the jobs are generally unstable and low-paying, and they cheat
the state of taxes and workers' compensation insurance premiums, said
economist Dan Flaming, who prepared the report.</LD>
<LD>   "This seems to be our area of growth, and that can't be a good
thing," Flaming said.</LD>
<TE>   The findings, supported by a variety of measures, are no surprise
to worker advocates in a range of industries with large immigrant
work forces, including the construction, apparel, janitorial and
tourism industries. The phenomenon also has been acknowledged by
state labor officials, who are redirecting their enforcement efforts
to staunch the growth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge," said Steve Smith, director of the state Department of
Industrial Relations, which enforces labor laws. "It's bad enough on
the people who work in it, because there is much greater potential
for abuse [of wage, hour and safety laws]. But those employers also
compete with legitimate firms, driving the good employers out of
business."</TE>
<TE>   By its nature, the underground or informal economy is difficult to
track, let alone control. There are no hard numbers available on jobs
or lost taxes. And one economist urged caution. Although he had not
seen the latest report, Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the
Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, said past
claims of informal sector growth have proved to be "hugely
overstated."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Mitchell, a UCLA labor economist, said the trend would not
be surprising given the region's strong draw of undocumented
immigrants, which could account for at least one-tenth of the area's
work force. "You often find this phenomenon in less developed
countries," he said. "Some have said we're now importing that
characteristic."</TE>
<TE>   The study examined the gap between payroll tax records and jobs
reported in worker surveys, and adjusted the number for various
factors, including worker commuting patterns, self-employment and
people who hold multiple jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Taking these and other factors into account, the report said the
informal sector could range from 9% to a startling 29%, although
Flaming said the true number is probably somewhere in the middle of
the two extremes.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear, he said: The underground economy is growing
fast in Los Angeles, while the national and state economies are
moving in the opposite direction. "The evidence suggests that Los
Angeles County is indeed undergoing a transformation of its economy,
whereby a large number of jobs are 'going underground,' leaving
workers with limited rights," he wrote in the briefing paper, to be
released today.</TE>
<TE>   Flaming came across the trend when comparing employment data from
two sources: state payroll numbers supplied by employers and worker
surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
numbers steadily grew apart in L.A. County through the 1990s, with
official employment stagnating while growing numbers of workers
reported holding jobs.</TE>
<TE>   He also compared national employment ratios with those in Los
Angeles to identify sectors where off-the-books employment seems
especially large. Not surprisingly, they include agriculture, private
household services, food manufacturing, construction and eating and
drinking establishments.</TE>
<TE>   The region pays a high price, Flaming maintains. Using an informal
employment rate of 15%, and setting wages at $7,200 a year, he
estimates the state loses about $1.1 billion in payroll benefits,
such Social Security taxes, workers' compensation insurance and
unemployment insurance. He said the workers also would lose about
$1.5 billion in federal earned income tax payments.</TE>
<TE>   Last month the International Monetary Fund expressed similar
concerns in an issues paper, saying "shadow economies" appear to be
growing throughout the world, accounting for as much as 77% of the
gross domestic product in Nigeria, for example. The share of the
economy in developing nations normally ranges from 35% to 44%; it is
far lower in industrialized countries. The IMF estimated the informal
economy in the United States at 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "An increase in the size of the shadow economy is likely to result
in reduced state revenues, which in turn reduces the quality and
quantity of publicly provided goods and services," the IMF report
said. "Ultimately this can lead to an increase in tax rates for firms
and individuals, quite often combined with a deterioration in the
quality and administration of the public goods such as roads and
hospitals provided by the government."</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging the potential problems, California created a task
force to combat the informal economy in 1993, combining investigators
from the tax board, criminal justice, labor law enforcement and job
development to target problem employers. Smith, the DIR director,
said those efforts will be enhanced by combining many of those
departments under one cabinet-level Labor Agency, which is planned to
start in midsummer.</TE>
<TE>   Flaming said enhanced enforcement is essential for reducing the
informal economy, and that education and training, immigration reform
and greater union organizing among low-wage workers also would be
helpful. In any case, he said, public debate and initiatives are
needed. "The problem doesn't seem to be curing itself by not talking
about it."</TE>

<HD>Riordan's Newspaper May Face Big Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Media: Some experts cite challenge, high cost of starting a
paper in the L.A. market. Others say with the right strategy it could
survive.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If former Mayor Richard Riordan launches a newspaper in Los Angeles,
as he says he will, he must ignore those ready to declare his idea a
fool's errand.</LD>
<LD>   It will be expensive, take a long time to establish and be
difficult to do well, newspaper executives and analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing dumber than starting a new newspaper in a
competitive market ... well, I can't think of anything dumber," said
Peter Appert, a newspaper industry analyst with Deutsche Bank.</LD>
<TE>   William Dean Singleton, chief executive of MediaNews Group Inc.,
publisher of the San Fernando Valley-based Daily News, predicted
Riordan's plan would be costly.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll lose a bundle of money in a hurry," Singleton said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan is undaunted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more confident today than ever that we'll pull this off," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to redress what he called the "negativity" of the Los
Angeles Times, which is owned by Tribune Co., Riordan said he's
exploring various newspaper business models. He'd prefer to publish
five days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I really can see answers to the key questions," said Sue Laris,
editor and publisher of the Los Angeles Downtown News and an advisor
to Riordan on this project. Profit is possible--she started her
weekly 30 years ago and the publication is still going strong. And
there is no rush for Riordan to start up a paper.</TE>
<TE>   John P. Puerner, publisher of The Times, issued a statement on the
possibility of Riordan starting a paper.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles Times has operated in a very competitive market
for a long period of time," Puerner said. "We think competition makes
us better."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bellows, a former editor of three now-defunct newspapers--the
Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Washington Star and New York Herald
Tribune--is another of Riordan's advisors. His book, "The Last
Editor," details the travails of running a big city's No. 2
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to do some very different things so you aren't just
mimicking the Los Angeles Times," Bellows said. Riordan is going to
have to "get people to demand the paper."</TE>
<TE>   Even if a counter-programming strategy works, newspaper industry
analyst John Morton said Riordan probably won't have a viable
business.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of new newspapers is the history of failure," Morton
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the more than a dozen metro daily newspapers launched in the
last several decades, he said, the only one to survive is the
Washington Times, which is underwritten by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church.</TE>
<TE>   "To challenge the Los Angeles Times directly, I won't say you
can't, but it would cost billions of dollars," said Harold W. Fuson,
vice president and chief legal officer of Copley Press Inc., which
operates the Daily Breeze with 80,000 paid subscribers in the South
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Fuson said the Daily Breeze, in most parts of the world, would be
a good-size paper, but where it serves, it's a struggle to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Copley has closed down several of its Los Angeles regional papers,
including the Santa Monica Outlook, which ceased publication in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think that Santa Monica would support a separate
newspaper, but they didn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A tightly focused Westside daily, he said, would cost a minimum of
$30 million to operate for two years.</TE>
<TE>   A staff of 40 people--Riordan expects to hire 25 journalists and a
support and sales staff of 15 with freelancers writing the bulk of
the stories--would cost a minimum of $3 million a year, Fuson said,
and personnel typically is only 20% of the overall costs of running a
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Fuson said that if Riordan wants to put out a quality product,
he'll have to spend much more on his writers.</TE>
<TE>   In Riordan's favor, the audience he has said he wants to
reach--the high-income Westside neighborhoods of Brentwood, Bel Air,
Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades--could be an
advertiser's dream.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold York is publisher of the free weekly Malibu Times, which
has a circulation of 12,000 in this elite demographic. Is his paper
profitable? Yes, he said. Very profitable? No.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't already own a Malibu home, I sure couldn't buy one on
what I make here," York said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan should rethink his strategy, said Pluria Marshall,
publisher of another local weekly, the Wave, and the three
Independent weeklies owned by Equal Access Media Inc., a chain of
primarily African American papers and radio stations. He never starts
a newspaper from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole lot easier to clean up a bad image than create a new
one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A weekly paper has the greatest chance of survival, Bellows and
several others in the media industry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Dailies lose money every day. With weeklies, all of the risks are
reduced," newspaper analyst Morton said. "Send it directly to 200,000
of the people in the highest economic demographic in your area. Then
sell that audience to advertisers.... With enough hubris,
determination and rich friends, he has a shot."</TE>
<TE>   "Alternative papers work because of the escort and masseuse ads
... sex ads. It's a big chunk of the money," said Rick Barrs, editor
of New Times Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said his paper will "show all of the wonderful things
about Los Angeles, the treasures."</TE>
<TE>   "The missing link in Los Angeles is no one is treating L.A.
fairly. We're the cultural center of the whole world, the capital of
the Pacific Rim," he said. "I'm not a booster the way Harry Chandler
[one of the early publishers of the Los Angeles Times] was. I'm not
trying to sell house lots. I want tough reporting."</TE>

<HD>Employers Adding Lots of Overtime, Not Jobs</HD>
<DH>Labor: Many firms are being cautious as business gradually
picks up, preferring to have workers put in longer hours instead of
increasing payrolls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLOS TORRES</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Phil Raimondo is asking employees at his factories to put in longer
hours to meet demand as the U.S. economy recovers.</LD>
<LD>   Orders waiting to be filled have surged 25% in the last three
months at Behlen Manufacturing Co., which makes structures for the
building of offices, shopping malls, aircraft hangars and livestock
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   That doesn't mean Raimondo, the company's president and chief
operating officer, is rushing to put the help-wanted sign back in the
window.</LD>
<TE>   "Business is picking up, but we are responding to that very
cautiously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Behlen and auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. are
meeting production demands by boosting overtime instead of adding to
payrolls. That suggests many of the 1.7 million factory workers who
lost their jobs since the manufacturing recession began in August
2000 will have to wait months before finding employment.</TE>
<TE>   Rising overtime "is a positive sign that orders and production are
picking up, but it also tells you there is a certain wariness about
its sustainability," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank
in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably takes several more quarters of stable to rising
demand before you start to see new hiring," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance of some companies to hire helps explain why Federal
Reserve policymakers probably will keep the benchmark overnight bank
lending rate at a 40-year low of 1.75% to sustain the economic
rebound when they meet Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Average weekly manufacturing overtime jumped to 4.2 hours in
March, the highest in 14 months, from 3.9 hours in February even as
factories cut 38,000 jobs, Labor Department data showed last month.</TE>
<TE>   The April employment report probably will show that factories
eliminated an additional 20,000 jobs in April, according to the
median of 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have boosted overtime at a faster rate than they did
after the 1990-91 recession. Four months after reaching a low of 3.7
hours in November 2001, average weekly overtime has increased by 30
minutes. That compares with an overtime increase of 18 minutes in the
four months that followed the end of the last recession in March
1991.</TE>
<TE>   At Columbus-based Behlen, overtime in the three months that ended
in April is up about 20% compared with the previous three months.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, payrolls are up 7% since October, the month Behlen
was forced to make a second round of layoffs as the recession
deepened after the terrorist attacks. Still, the company has 1,330
workers on its payroll, down from almost 1,450 employees in the
summer of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Where we are sure we will see some sustainability in business, we
are hiring some people," Raimondo said.</TE>
<TE>   Delphi, the largest auto-parts maker, is still cutting jobs. The
company said last month that it's eliminating 6,100 jobs this year to
reduce costs. That brings total job cuts to 17,540 since the company
instituted a reorganization plan in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The company still managed to bump up production about 3% this year
by using overtime and improving productivity, said company
spokeswoman Claudia Piccinin.</TE>
<TE>   "Although production is modestly up, we're not convinced that it
has stabilized at these levels," Piccinin said. "We will use overtime
as a buffer to continue to meet customer demand and will evaluate our
work force needs as the economy rebounds and stabilizes in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Concern about the sustainability of the recovery isn't the only
reason for the lack of hiring. Sometimes it's hard to find employees
with the right skills.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the work our employees do is very precise," said Gary
Johnson, vice president at Ace Clearwater Enterprises Inc., a
Torrance-based builder of formed and welded assemblies for the
aerospace and power generation industries. "It's a lot easier to put
experienced people on overtime than to start all over with new
people."</TE>
<TE>   Ace Clearwater is benefiting from a surge in defense spending as
the country continues the fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   An increase in orders from customers such as Honeywell
International Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp.--mainly spare parts for
military equipment--led to a 30% increase in overtime during the last
couple of months, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are building parts we haven't built in five years."</TE>
<TE>   Though the reliance on overtime may be bad news for workers trying
to find jobs, it's proving to be a boon to those getting paid
time-and-a-half for the extra work. That'll help the economy rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Contreras, a welder with Ace Clearwater for 23 years, is
putting to good use the extra cash he's earning by working eight to
20 overtime hours a week. Though saving some, he's spending much of
the extra income on a hobby--improvement projects in the house he's
owned for 16 years. He's in the process of remodeling the kitchen and
bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The father of three isn't concerned about spending the money.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I see it, I think the economy is going to come back and
grow," Contreras said. "I feel like we are going in the right
direction."</TE>

<HD>Surviving the Fall</HD>
<DH>Employees still with Global Crossing are trying to keep
spirits up while taking on the tasks of those laid off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Friday in February, Tom Hagerth and his team at Global Crossing
Ltd. worked into the night, rushing to round up some 750 computer
tapes stuffed with corporate e-mails that needed to be shipped
overnight to the Securities and Exchange Commission office in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Facilities manager Matthew Sullivan found himself moving from room
to room in Global Crossing's offices in Madison, N.J., removing paper
shredders and piling them in storage.</LD>
<LD>   Sue Riccardelli, who once busied herself writing product
literature, now spends her days poring over bankruptcy motions,
affidavits and rulings.</LD>
<TE>   This is life now inside Global Crossing, where employees who were
once flush with valuable company stock are taking up unexpected tasks
and trying desperately to salvage what's left of the once-proud firm.
The company, which built a worldwide fiber-optic communications
network, collapsed under the weight of debt payments and slumping
sales, filing the fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in late
January.</TE>
<TE>   Its many flaws have been in the news ever since. There are
questions about Global Crossing's accounting methods, its cozy
relations with accounting firm Arthur Andersen and how top executives
and stockholders profited despite the firm's travails. The company is
under investigation by the SEC and the FBI and is facing scrutiny
from congressional lawmakers. In Bankruptcy Court, Global Crossing's
future hangs in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   For Global Crossing employees, the situation is painful and more
than a little stressful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being trashed. It's kind of like, 'How does the
Catholic Church feel right now?'" said Ian Mitroff, a workplace
crisis management expert and professor at USC's Marshall School of
Business. "It's unfair, but that's what happens in a crisis, and
that's why you don't want to get into one of these things."</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure to slash costs, Global Crossing recently offered
employee buyouts, then followed with layoffs. The company has about
5,000 employees, down from a peak of more than 14,300 in March 2001,
not counting employees at subsidiary Global Marine and sister company
Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   The payroll cuts have thrown about 4,500 Global Crossing employees
out of work in the last year, with many of them leaving without
promised severance payments from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Firm's Situation Tough on Those Still There</TE>
<TE>   Employees who have stayed with the company are traumatized too.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't sleep, and when you do sleep, you dream about this
place," Riccardelli said. During the latest round of buyouts, "I must
have gotten 10 e-mails from people saying goodbye. It's very, very
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, the New Jersey facilities manager, is forced to face
each employee departure head-on because he's the one who picks up and
stores the idle computers, phones and other equipment they leave
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like going through someone's stuff that died," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And every day, Riccardelli and other employees get blunt reminders
of how far the company has fallen.</TE>
<TE>   They're surrounded by empty cubicles, vacant parking spots, unused
conference rooms and unfilled seats in the cafeteria, where the
service has been downgraded to mostly sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   In California, employees who once worked in the luxury of the
company's swank Beverly Hills office have set up shop in decidedly
unglamorous digs in El Segundo, a mostly industrial city near Los
Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as pretty, but it's not horrible," said Robyn Adel,
Global Crossing's vice president of sales in the Western region. "We
have the furniture from Beverly Hills, so it's fine."</TE>
<TE>   But Adel and the others still employed have extra work now, and
lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   "With the head-count reductions, that work doesn't go away, so you
start to pick things up you didn't do before," said Maria Funkhauser,
an area vice president. "Your job just gets harder and harder on a
day-by-day and a minute-by-minute basis."</TE>
<TE>   Workplace experts said such stress frequently dampens productivity
and undermines efforts to lift employees' morale.</TE>
<TE>   Bitterness also can enter the mix at companies where executives
get bonuses or severance payments at the same time lower-level
employees are loaded down with work or leave with little or nothing
in compensation, said David Bowman, chairman of TTG Consultants, a
firm that specializes in "human capital."</TE>
<TE>   At Global Crossing, most laid-off employees had expenses that were
not reimbursed and had their severance pay abruptly halted when the
company filed for bankruptcy. Most employees still at the firm are
doing more work for the same pay.</TE>
<TE>   Executives, meanwhile, are in line to get lucrative retention
bonuses for the duration of bankruptcy proceedings. And Chief
Executive John Legere was awarded a $3.5-million signing bonus just
weeks before the Chapter 11 filing. He also is scheduled to receive
as much as $11 million in compensation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Atmosphere Has Some Trying to Leave</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by stress, uncertainty and hard feelings, it's
inevitable that some employees will choose to flee to another
company--or at least try to.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Rosenberg, managing director of Irvine-based BridgeGate,
said his executive search firm has received "innumerable" calls from
Global Crossing managers hoping to find a new job. If the industry
wasn't in such bad shape, he said, "they might have been very quickly
assimilated into other companies."</TE>
<TE>   But the telecommunications industry has never been in worse shape,
with companies closing offices and slashing jobs on an unprecedented
scale.</TE>
<TE>   In a little more than a year, equipment firms, carriers and other
telecom companies have cut more than 400,000 jobs, nearly three times
the tally for the dot-com bust affecting Internet and other high-tech
firms. On top of that, there is the potential stigma of having worked
at a company in bankruptcy and under investigation by federal
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to put Enron, or Andersen, or Global Crossing on your
resume, don't you?" said Bowman of TTG Consultants. "What do you say
when the interviewer asks if you were partly to blame?"</TE>
<TE>   Many employees have rejected the notion that there is a
gloom-and-doom atmosphere at the company. They said morale is
gradually improving now that the publicity has died down and several
interested buyers for the company have emerged.</TE>
<TE>   "I almost feel that the worst is over, and there might be light at
the end of the tunnel," said Alan Rosenberg, vice president of sales
engineering, who joined Global Crossing after spending much of his
career at AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg said his job remains challenging and stressful, but
"I've gotten more out of 18 months here than I got out of 16 years at
AT&amp;T."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, the facilities manager, said he's nervous because he has
a wife and three children. But he has an air of determination about
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't even updated my resume, because for me, failure is not
an option," he said. Besides, Sullivan added, "The people make it fun
to work."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of humor also helps. One employee joked that he hasn't
worn his Global Crossing T-shirt or cap for a while, and Rosenberg
noted that his job "makes great dinner conversation.... I'm very
popular now."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Grivner, Global Crossing's chief operating officer, said he's
noticed that his mother now ends every phone call with: "Well, I'm
praying for you."</TE>
<TE>   He said his job is an energizing experience because there are few
templates for handling a company in crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "You go look at Harvard Business School, and where's the class on
bankruptcy or on cash management in cases like this?"</TE>
<TE>   Grivner said Global Crossing is focused on keeping employees
motivated, serving customers and bringing in badly needed revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Legere, the CEO, is battling the internal malaise through daily
company newsletters, frequent employee teleconferences and visits to
company sites to conduct in-person town hall sessions with employees
in offices throughout Europe, the United States and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to be a team when you're in times like these--where
you've got bankruptcy, plus you've got congressional hearings, plus
you've got allegations, plus, plus, plus," Grivner said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sitting on the floor singing 'Kum Ba Yah,' but that's
kind of what it's about right now."</TE>

<HD>Rates Will Stay Put, Economists Predict</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a patchy U.S. economic recovery underway and few signs that
inflation poses an imminent threat, most economists say they expect
the Federal Reserve to wait until at least the latter half of this
year before raising interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts are united in one opinion--none of them expects the
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee to act when it meets
Tuesday, leaving the bellwether federal funds rate, which influences
borrowing costs throughout the economy, at a four-decade low. And
many see policymakers indulging the fledgling economic recovery for
yet a few more months.</LD>
<LD>   "They have the luxury of time," said Richard Berner, chief U.S.
economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.</LD>
<TE>   The central bank staged one of its most aggressive campaigns in
history last year, cutting interest rates 11 times, for a total of
4.75 percentage points, to help prop up the ailing U.S. economy,
hammered anew after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the economy, fueled with the added liquidity from a federal
funds rate of 1.75% and a stimulus package of tax cuts and other
measures, has headed for better days, adding to expectations of rate
increases in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The question is how many months. Softer data in recent weeks,
including the April employment report, which showed a jump in the
jobless rate to a level unseen since 1994, have many economists
believing that rate rises are more probable in August or beyond.</TE>
<TE>   A Reuters survey of 21 primary dealers, firms that deal directly
with the Fed, found that no one expects the central bank to raise the
federal funds rate Tuesday. Just one firm still sees a move at the
Fed's next meeting at the end of June, versus 10 in a similar poll
taken two weeks ago. Of the 21, 16 expect the first rate increase at
the Aug. 13 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   However, although there are some economists quietly expressing the
view that the central bank could wait out the entire year without
shifting interest rates, most see the Fed beginning to tighten this
year to, among other things, ward off future risks of inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things out there that say inflation is well
under control now. The fact of the matter is I think that this is as
good as it gets on inflation," said Berner, who sees August as the
most likely time for a rate rise.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed in August is likely to begin a process of recalibrating
monetary policy to neutral, which could take up to a year," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the economy is well into recovery--logging a swift
5.8% rate of growth in the first quarter--labor market weakness is
likely to be the key factor that will keep the Fed cautious on hiking
interest rates, economists say.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions in the labor market are still not strong enough to
really tell us that the complete deterioration in the labor market is
behind us," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment
Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   And even if things turn around in the near future on the labor
front, analysts say the Fed isn't likely to raise rates until there
have been several months of steady job growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed isn't just going to start raising rates on the first sign
of someone finding a job," said James Glassman, senior economist at
J.P. Morgan Chase in New York. "But at some point companies have to
start hiring, and my guess is by summer we're going to see some
better news."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment
rate surged in April to 6%, the highest since a matching level in
August 1994, from 5.7% the month before. The steep jump in the
unemployment rate overshadowed the fact that U.S. firms added jobs to
their payrolls for the first time in nine months during April--just
not enough jobs to absorb a big jump in the work force.</TE>
<TE>   Nonfarm payrolls rose 43,000 in April after a revised loss of
21,000 in March. The March payrolls number suffered a sharp negative
revision from a gain of 58,000.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the picture for April was the fact that 565,000 more
people joined the work force, swelling it to a record-high 142.57
million Americans who either held jobs or were looking for them last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the complexities of the report, the numbers taken as a
whole heightened concerns about the recovery and bolstered the
conviction that rate rises were still some months away.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed should do nothing," said Robert Macintosh, an economist
with Eaton Vance Management Inc. in Boston. "The economy right now is
just barely moving forward, and that's not an environment for the Fed
to raise rates. I don't expect rates to rise this year."</TE>
<TE>   And though most economists believe the Fed's first rate increase
will come no sooner than August, some question how fast the rises
will follow thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank was quick to ease monetary policy last year as
the economy fell into recession, but the pace of the recovery now
underway is likely to dictate how frequently and by how much it will
increase rates.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a gradual economic recovery. If it is a
gradual recovery then there is no reason for them to move in like
gangbusters," Chan said.</TE>
<TE>   But some economists worry that the Fed, if faced much later in the
year with the prospect of inflation, may have to act with bigger
interest rate rises.</TE>
<TE>   "They will probably be playing catch-up," said Paul Kasriel, chief
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen the dollar weaken and we've seen industrial commodity
prices, with or without energy prices, move up. The market is
beginning to anticipate higher inflation and yet [Fed Chairman Alan]
Greenspan wants to be reactive," Kasriel added.</TE>

<HD>Good Times Roll for Cable Executives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As U.S. cable industry executives arrive in hot, humid New Orleans
for their annual convention this week, the heat is likely only from
the temperature and not from regulators, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Cable operators have scored key victories since they last
gathered, including persuading a federal court to strike down a key
ownership restriction as well as insulating their high-speed Internet
services from having to share their systems.</LD>
<LD>   And just last week, the top 10 cable operators, including AT&amp;T
Broadband and AOL Time Warner Inc., moved out of the frying pan by
accepting a challenge from the Federal Communications Commission to
speed the move to digital television.</LD>
<TE>   "Cable, like everyone else in the telecom/media sector, faces a
variety of challenges in a difficult economic climate," Legg Mason
analysts Blair Levin and Michael Balhoff said in a research note. "In
our opinion, however, the challenges do not include a negative
regulatory climate."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the cable industry has been plowing ahead rolling out
high-speed Internet service to more than 7 million customers and
deploying local telephone service, challenging the dominant local
telephone carriers. But the sky is not completely clear, with some
members of Congress complaining about rising cable prices and
independent Internet service providers seeking open access to the
cable pipeline.</TE>

<HD>Productivity Expected to Show 7% Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. productivity in the first quarter probably raced ahead at the
fastest pace in two years, making it easier for businesses to boost
profits and fuel the economy's rebound.</LD>
<LD>   The measure of how much work an employee performs in an hour
probably rose 7% at an annual rate in the first three months of the
year, analysts say the Labor Department's report will show Tuesday.
That would follow a 5.2% pace of increase in the fourth quarter and
would be the strongest since a 7.8% surge in the final three months
of 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Productivity gains at that pace "set the stage for an eventual
resumption in growth for business investment and give companies more
leeway to expand hiring," said James O'Sullivan, a senior economist
at UBS Warburg in Stamford, Conn.</LD>
<TE>   That helps explain why the Fed won't change interest rates when it
meets Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Gains in efficiency at companies such as DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler unit also keep a lid on costs, allowing them to offer
products at lower prices. Labor costs probably fell at a 3.6% rate
after declining at a 2.7% pace, marking the first consecutive
quarterly decrease since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   What more, a Labor Department's report Friday on producer costs
probably will provide evidence of tame inflation.</TE>
<TE>   The government's producer price index probably rose 0.4% in April
after a 1% jump in March. Excluding food and energy prices, the index
probably increased 0.1% for a second straight month.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department will probably will report a
0.4% decline in March wholesale inventories after a 0.7% decrease,
suggesting the pace of stockpile reductions is slowing. Sales at
wholesalers probably rose 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, the Fed probably will report that consumer credit
rose by $5.8 billion in March after a $7-billion rise in February.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Labor Department's weekly report on initial
jobless claims probably will show a decline to 409,000 for the week
that ended Saturday. In the previous week, 418,000 Americans filed
first-time claims.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the Labor Department probably will report a 0.6%
increase in prices of imports, as the cost of petroleum rose.</TE>

<HD>Ford Annual Meeting in Irvine on Thursday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. is bringing its annual shareholder meeting to Southern
California this week, the first time since it went public in 1956
that the company will hold a general meeting on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The session, at 10 a.m. Thursday, will be held at the new Ford
complex in Irvine, home of Lincoln Mercury's world headquarters and
the North American headquarters of Ford's Premier Automotive Group
and its Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover and Aston Martin brands.</LD>
<LD>   Ford has had a miserable year so far, with sagging sales, quality
glitches and a $108-million first-quarter loss on the heels of a
$5.4-billion annual loss for its fiscal 2001. But annual meeting
planning started months ago, and the move west isn't seen as an
effort to run away from Michigan and the largest concentration of
Ford shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Thursday's theme is expected to be a celebration of the new
facility and of Ford's hopes for its upscale marques and its future.</TE>
<TE>   The firm launched a restructuring plan in January and said last
month that it expects to return to profitability in the second half
of the year--themes that Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. is likely to
focus on during his address.</TE>
<TE>   About 50,000 of Ford's 900,000 shareholders live in Southern
California, and one of them, Redondo Beach resident John Chevedden,
is pushing two of the three proposals on the agenda to boost common
shareholder power and reduce Ford family influence over the company.</TE>
<TE>   But Stephen G. Harper, Ford's manager of shareholder relations,
said out-of-state annual meetings typically have light attendance,
"under 500," and that he's not expecting a larger turnout or much in
the way of fireworks Thursday. The proposals, all opposed by the
company, "aren't any different than those we've had in the past," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Only seven other annual meetings since Ford went public have been
held outside of the greater Detroit area, and the farthest west until
now has been St. Paul, Minn., where Ford has an assembly plant.</TE>
<TE>   Ford selects annual meeting sites where the company has a
significant presence, usually a factory, and a large concentration of
shareholders. Next year, for the company's 100th anniversary, the
meeting site returns to the Detroit area.</TE>

<HD>Treasury to Conduct Larger Security Auctions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the federal budget deficit deepening more rapidly than
predicted, the Treasury has begun to change its security auctions.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, Tuesday it will sell $22 billion in five-year notes,
an increase from its sales of $16 billion in February and $11 billion
last August. In addition, it will sell $11 billion in 10-year notes
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Since the five-year-note auction will be so large, it will not be
a reopening of the February issue, as it would have been in the past.
And the Treasury is studying whether to drop its practice of
reopening 10-year note issues as well.</LD>
<TE>   The Wednesday sale will be a reopening of the one in February.
Analysts said increasing the size of the five-year-note auctions
probably will raise their yields compared with those of two-year
notes.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Treasury will sell $15 billion each in three- and
six-month bills, followed by the two note auctions Tuesday and
Wednesday. In when-issued trading Friday, the bills yielded 1.76% and
1.88% and the notes 4.45% and 5.08%, respectively. Also Monday, the
Treasury will announce details of an auction of four-week bills to be
held Tuesday.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testifying to both the power of a comic book superhero and the
blockbuster potential of the megaplex, the action adventure
"Spider-Man" smashed box office records this weekend, taking in an
estimated $114 million. It's the first film to go over $100 million
in a three-day opening weekend and tops the previous record holder,
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," by more than $20 million.</LD>
<LD>   Even though "Spider-Man" opened on more than 7,500 screens, lines
for the film snaked around the block at theater complexes around
Southern California and the rest of the country. The film, made by
Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment, averaged $31,535 per
screen; a film that averages a third as much is considered a roaring
success.</LD>
<LD>   In the megaplex era, audiences could catch "Spider-Man" virtually
every half an hour. At the new Pacific Grove multiplex in L.A.,
adjacent to the Farmers Market, five of 14 screens were given over to
the film, which was screening every 30 minutes from 11 a.m. to 11
p.m. On Friday all shows were sold out by 3 p.m, according to the
managers.</LD>
<TE>   "I had to see it opening weekend," said 19-year-old Eugene Kim of
Los Angeles' Koreatown, who was about to go into a midafternoon
screening Saturday with 10 friends who had preordered tickets
Thursday. Jonathan Zeidman, 18, of Westwood, was in line with his
sister Jacqueline, 19. He had already seen "Spider-Man," having
secured one of the few seats Sony Pictures handed out to the public
for the film's star-studded premiere last Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We came last night, but we couldn't get in," Jacqueline Zeidman
said. Added her brother, "I'm a big fan of the [comic] books. And I
thought it was well-cast, and Sam Raimi did a great job of
directing." Asked whether he'd pay to see it yet again, he said,
"Yeah, I'm coming back with my friends."</TE>
<TE>   Mark and Jennifer Dos Santos saw "Spider-Man" on opening night at
Universal Studios Cinema at Universal CityWalk, where it was playing
on six of 18 screens. The couple arrived at the movie theater at 7
p.m., but the earliest tickets they could buy were for the 10:15
show. The seven shows between those times had already sold out, said
Jennifer Dos Santos, 27.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty crazy just trying to get through that, but it was
totally worth it," she said. Added her husband: "It was a really cool
audience to go with, because they really got into it."</TE>
<TE>   With megaplexes fast replacing individual theaters, studios can
open big films on more and more screens. ("Harry Potter," for
example, opened on 8,200 screens last November.) Four of the top five
opening weekends are for films that opened within the last year; the
only exception is 1997's "The Lost World: Jurassic Park." Heretofore
unheard-of opening-weekend grosses have become increasingly common
because of megaplexes that can offer up as many screens as the
traffic will bear and, in many cases, the possibility of ordering
tickets in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard of megaplexes that were having as many as 30 screenings
per day of 'Spider-Man,'" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the
industry tracking firm Exhibitor Relations. "Technology has made it
possible for one print to be shown simultaneously on two screens,
through a process called interlocking."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the record-shattering numbers for "Spider-Man" show the
character's appeal to a wide spectrum of the audience, many of whom
had waited years to see the conflicted comic book hero come to the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   "It all started with Stan Lee," who co-created the character for
Marvel Comics, said Amy Pascal, chairwoman of Columbia Pictures. "He
created a character who has lived in people's hearts for 40 years.
Sam Raimi took that and with Tobey Maguire [in the title role] made
it into a great movie that realized its potential." The film opened
Friday to generally positive reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Sansolis, 22, said he and a friend bought their tickets
online to make sure they weren't turned away by a sellout at the
Burbank 14 box office. "We wanted to see it since, like, last year,"
Sansolis said.</TE>
<TE>   Sony bought the rights to "Spider-Man" three years ago, after a
year of negotiations, and spent a reported $120 million to produce
the film and at least $50 million to market and distribute it. The
payoff was quick; on Friday "Spider-Man" had the best opening day
ever, taking in $39.3 million, a record it quickly outdid Saturday
when it climbed to $43.7 million, according to Sony marketing and
distribution chief Jeff Blake. That was about $10 million more than
"Harry Potter's" single-day record. Sunday receipts were estimated to
be about $31 million.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Ammer, Sony senior marketing executive, said Sunday that
"Spider-Man" added theaters throughout the weekend and played to a
wide demographic, almost equally male and female and evenly split
between older (over 25) and younger patrons. "The exit polls were
very strong across the board," Ammer said. That's unusual among
recent action-oriented blockbuster films, which generally target
young male audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Nachum, 11, of Beverly Hills, had just seen the film at the
Pacific Grove with 20 of his friends as part of his birthday
celebration and gave it "two thumbs up. The best part was Kirsten
Dunst," who plays Spider-Man's romantic interest.</TE>
<TE>   Brock Klein, 50, and James Trivers, 53, also enjoyed the film.
Klein said Maguire was "an inspired choice" for the lead. "He played
it like an actor," Trivers said, "bringing human behavior to a
superhuman context."</TE>
<TE>   Sony's Blake said "Spider-Man" could rake in an additional $30
million to $40 million by Thursday. And even if the movie's business
declines by 50% this coming weekend--as is common for films with huge
openings--it would still surpass $200 million by Sunday. That's still
a long way from the all-time box office champ, "Titanic," which
grossed more than $600 million in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood hit action films have traditionally grossed as much or
more overseas. Over the weekend, "Spider-Man" broke records in
Southeast Asia, Blake said. By conservative estimate, "Spider-Man's"
worldwide gross should be double its U.S. take. Videotape, DVD,
television and merchandising sales would then elevate the film's
total haul over the $1-billion mark.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" kicks off the lucrative summer season in high style
in what has already been a banner year for movies, with box office
revenue running about 15% ahead of 2001. The movie industry records
about 40% of its annual admissions during the May-to-early-September
period. With high-powered sequels to "Star Wars," "Men in Black" and
"Austin Powers" due over the next two months, the industry is hoping
to better the record $3.06 billion collected last summer. "We're off
to a pretty rousing start," Dergarabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Hollywood has entered what many are calling
the "franchise era," with the movie divisions of major conglomerates
increasingly reliant on "event" films and the sequels they spawn for
financial viability. Even before the premiere of "Spider-Man," Sony
had won commitments from Maguire, Raimi and other key players to a
sequel, which starts shooting in January for release in summer 2004.
Pascal said she is going to draw upon Lee's existing material to help
fashion future "Spider-Man" installments.</TE>
<TE>   Sony, which has had its share of ups ("Charlie's Angels," "Men in
Black") and downs ("Godzilla," "Ali") in recent years, is hoping to
use the success of "Spider-Man" to dominate the summer. "We had 20
million people this weekend viewing our trailers, which is very
important," Blake said. Among those trailers were Sony's sequels to
"Stuart Little" and "Men in Black," as well as the Adam Sandler
comedy "Mr. Deeds."</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, "Spider-Man" is the only game in town. Eric
Delgado, 25, of Los Angeles, was part of the crowd lining up at
Edwards South Gate theaters on Friday night long before the movie was
to begin. Delgado, suffering from a cold, complained to the managers:
"Do you expect me to wait outside?" But wait he did. Said Delgado:
"It was mayhem."</TE>

<HD>German Union Members Strike</HD>
<DH>Labor: At a major DaimlerChrysler plant, 2,000 workers
launch the first of several expected one-day work stoppages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID McHUGH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SINDELFINGEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>The overnight shift at a major DaimlerChrysler plant on Sunday
launched the first strike by Germany's largest industrial union in
seven years, one that could slow the recovery of Europe's biggest
economy.</LD>
<LD>   The powerful IG Metall union said 2,000 workers at the
German-American auto giant's sprawling Sindelfingen works honored
calls to stay home for the night shift, beginning one-day work
stoppages at major employers in southern Baden-Wuerttemberg state, a
heartland of German manufacturing.</LD>
<LD>   The plant and its 25,000 workers make Mercedes-Benz C- and E-class
luxury models, among the company's most consistent profit-makers.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of the 2.7-million-member IG Metall union, which also
represents workers in electronics and engineering, have said the
stoppage is to spread today to U.S.-headquartered tractor maker John
Deere, which has a plant in Mannheim, and car makers Porsche and Audi
as well as two more DaimlerChrysler plants.</TE>
<TE>   Any wage settlement in Baden-Wuerttemberg is expected to set the
pattern for workers across Germany. Most contracts are negotiated
between unions and regional employer associations representing entire
industries.</TE>
<TE>   Pay talks broke down April 19 after the union rejected employers'
offer of a 3.3% increase for 15 months. Employers say they can't go
higher, and some economists say any increase more than 3% endangers
jobs and fuels inflation.</TE>
<TE>   The union has said it wants a 6.5% increase as part of a one-year
deal to compensate workers for moderate increases in the past,
inflation and higher productivity, but observers expect it to settle
for less. IG Metall members earn an average of about $1,800 a month,
plus benefits including six weeks of paid vacation and bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   IG Metall head Klaus Zwickel said companies may be hit repeatedly
with strikes on short notice, costing them millions of dollars a day
in lost business. The union has called its first strike since 1995
despite appeals from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for a wage deal
that doesn't snuff out the beginning of economic recovery in Germany.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>ESOPs Make Sense Only in Certain Situations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I'm thinking about selling my business three to five
years down the road and may want to explore an ESOP as one exit
alternative. What are the pros and cons to this approach?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) involve highly
complex transactions and should be entered into with great care and
deliberation. But in the right situations they offer significant
benefits to business owners and employees.</LD>
<TE>   According to Marty Mayer, president of SCS Management, a San
Diego-based consulting firm that helps owners of middle-market
companies create and implement exit strategies, ESOPs offer owners
three major benefits: You can sell part or all of the company to your
employees without paying any taxes; you maintain 100% control of the
stock; you get a corporate tax deduction for the amount you get paid
for the stock. In addition, dividends paid on stock held by the plan
can be tax deductible.</TE>
<TE>   For employees, such stock plans make it possible to reap some of
the financial rewards of ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The ESOP forms a trust that holds the stock the owner sells.
During his or her term of employment, every employee maintains an
account in the trust.</TE>
<TE>   When employees leave or retire, their shares are redeemed for cash
by the company or by the plan itself.</TE>
<TE>   The downsides? The complex nature of ESOPs requires the services
of experienced specialists at every step of the way. As a result,
they cost a lot to set up and administer. Because they are covered by
Employee Retirement Income Security Act reporting rules (similar to
those in 401[k] and pension plans), ESOPs also incur ongoing
maintenance costs such as an annual valuation and administration
expenses. This requires that the company have sufficient cash flow to
pay for these expenses.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Mayer said, ESOPs work well only in certain narrowly
defined situations: when you want to leave the business to your
children or your employees while simultaneously funding your
retirement; if you need to buy out a spouse or partner who wants to
leave the business; if you want to put ownership in the hands of your
management team while locking them in with golden handcuffs; or if
you want to take money off the table while maintaining majority
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Employee stock ownership plans also can serve certain estate
planning purposes. For example, suppose you have two children but
only one wants to work in the company after you leave.</TE>
<TE>   An ESOP allows you to pull money out of the company, invest it in
something else and leave those assets to the child who doesn't want
to work in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, ESOPs don't make sense unless you sell at
least a third of the company," Mayer said. "Otherwise, it costs too
much, you don't pull enough money out of the company to make it worth
your while, and you create an ongoing entity that requires you to
report to the IRS every year.</TE>
<TE>   "If you decide to go forward, hire experts who specialize in ESOPs
and get a professional valuation of your business. Above all, make
sure you have enough free cash flow to finance the transaction.
Otherwise, your ESOP stands little chance of achieving its intended
goals."</TE>

<HD>Fox to Announce Video-on-Demand Deal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten days after pulling the plug on its video-on-demand joint venture
with Walt Disney Corp., News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox is expected to
announce a long-term deal with In Demand to offer Fox movies through
cable TV video-on-demand services.</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Fox is
believed to have won a better share of the proceeds from
video-on-demand sales than it receives from pay-per-view movies--60%
instead of 50%.</LD>
<LD>   The joint venture, Movies.com, was formed in part to strike
video-on-demand deals with cable operators on better terms than the
companies were getting for pay-per-view.</LD>
<TE>   But the venture and a competing offering from five other major
Hollywood studios drew the attention of the Department of Justice,
which launched an antitrust investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In Demand, which is owned by four top cable companies, also has
video-on-demand agreements with studios owned by Vivendi Universal,
Sony Corp., DreamWorks SKG and Artisan Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   About 3 million cable customers have access to movies on demand,
but the number is expected to rise rapidly this year as more cable
systems add the service.</TE>

<LD>Video game company Nintendo Co., the only console maker without a

services for the GameCube at a key industry trade show this month, an
industry source said.</LD>
<LD>   Nintendo will announce details of its online strategy for the

<LD>   Representatives for Nintendo said they could not confirm the

<TE>   By adding online capacity to its $199 GameCube, Nintendo would be
keeping pace with its major competitors in the market for game
hardware--Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp., both of which charge $299
for their consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Xbox has a built-in Ethernet port for high-speed

<HD>Spam Bill Expected to Reach Senate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A measure that would crack down on the unwanted junk e-mail known as
spam soon will head to the Senate floor, said Sen. Conrad R. Burns
(R-Mont.), one of the bill's sponsors.</LD>
<LD>   The measure enjoys enough support to win the Senate Commerce
Committee's approval when it is brought up for a committee vote,
tentatively scheduled for May 16, Burns said.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like we're finally going to get some action on
spamming," Burns said. "I think the bill is in pretty good shape
right now."</LD>
<TE>   Although 22 states have passed anti-spam legislation, efforts in
Congress have stumbled over opposition from direct marketers, who say
their activities would be unfairly limited.</TE>
<TE>   Burns' bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), would not
impose any new restrictions on commercial e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it would strengthen the enforcement authority of the
Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, allowing them
to impose fines of as much as $30 per e-mail, with a cap of $1.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   Spammers that hide their identities also would face criminal
penalties, and Internet service providers would be able to sue to
keep them off their networks.</TE>

<LD>Two Virginia congressmen unveiled a bill last week that would direct
states to turn their driver's licenses into computerized "smart"
cards, which would be more difficult to forge.</LD>
<LD>   Seeking to deter hijackers, criminals and underage drinkers from
obtaining false identity cards, Democratic Rep. Jim Moran and
Republican Rep. Tom Davis introduced a bill that would establish
standard security features for the state-issued cards.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would require states to include a computer chip
containing a digitized biometric identifier--such as a thumbprint or
a retina scan--that law enforcement officials could use to verify the
identity of a holder of a driver's license.</LD>

<HD>Get Into the Groove With Version 2.0</HD>
<DH>Software: Updated collaboration program enables users to
edit a document at the same time in orderly fashion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER SVENSSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine working on a business proposal on your computer. While you're
typing, somebody else's text also appears, paragraphs away from your
cursor.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a ghost in the machine, just your colleague on the other
side of the country, pitching in with her part. You're creating and
editing the document together, using Groove, a sophisticated but very
accessible piece of software.</LD>
<LD>   When it was first released a year ago, Groove was billed as the
program that would change the way we work.</LD>
<TE>   But it didn't quite live up to its promises. It was slow and the
cursor sometimes jumped around unpredictably when several users were
editing a document together, making the whole thing seem more like a
poorly refereed shouting match than orderly collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Groove 2.0, released a few weeks ago, addresses those problems and
adds some attractive features.</TE>
<TE>   The brainchild of Lotus Notes creator Ray Ozzie, Groove is
different from most other collaboration programs, such as those from
IManage Inc. and Intraspect Software Inc., in that there is no need
for a central computer or server to run things.</TE>
<TE>   Users simply install the software on their workstations. The
program shuttles data between PCs over the Internet or an office
network, keeping the document updated so participants see each
other's changes as they happen.</TE>
<TE>   Although Groove is aimed at the corporate world, just like its
rivals, it can easily be adopted by students and home users who want
to get away from passing e-mails back and forth when they want to get
a document right.</TE>
<TE>   The first version was unwieldy because every time a user made a
change to, for example, a text document, Groove would send the whole
updated document to all the other participants. This quickly ate into
computer performance and burdened networks.</TE>
<TE>   Groove 2.0 doesn't send the entire document every time, just the
changes. This means that the program is usable even over a dial-up
modem. Faster connections, such as cable modems or office networks,
are still preferable.</TE>
<TE>   In the business news department of the Associated Press, we're now
using the software to track stories in a small work group.</TE>
<TE>   After just a few weeks of "grooving," it's hard to imagine going
back to using ledgers to do the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Groove has proved very useful, even when we use only a few of its
many tools.</TE>
<TE>   There's a chat function that works much like AOL Instant
Messenger--though without an audible alert. There's a sketch pad that
works like a virtual whiteboard. You can even host a formal meeting,
with an agenda, a list of action points and minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The new Groove also works with Microsoft Word and PowerPoint,
allowing users to collaborate on documents and presentations in the
de facto standard office applications.</TE>
<TE>   Editing in Word isn't quite as elegant as Groove's built-in
writing pad because only one user can write at a time. That may be a
plus for large groups, however, in which users might otherwise get in
each other's way.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is an investor in Beverly, Mass.-based Groove Networks
Inc., so it's quite likely we will see further integration with
Microsoft products in future versions of Groove.</TE>
<TE>   Other changes in the new version are intended to satisfy the
demands of corporate network administrators. For instance, a company
computer can now maintain a directory of in-house Groove users,
making it easier to connect with colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   We had no problems connecting through the company firewall, but
editors at another company had trouble getting out through theirs. A
Groove Networks spokesman said the software is designed to work with
all firewalls but can have problems in rare cases.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of security, all the data Groove sends between computers
is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.</TE>
<TE>   Groove can be downloaded free for personal use from Groove.net.</TE>
<TE>   The free edition has some limitations (you can have only five
meetings running at the same time, for instance) but is adequate for
home users. However, it takes up about 30 megabytes, so don't try to
download it over a dial-up modem.</TE>
<TE>   The standard version costs $49, and a beefed-up professional
edition is $99. Groove works only with Windows PCs.</TE>

<HD>Delays Running Out for Wireless Firms</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Carriers say federal mandates to boost capacity,
services are likely to mean rate increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After years of delay, federal regulators are digging in their heels
and pushing initiatives that will require the wireless industry to
spend billions of dollars to expand capacity and offer new services.</LD>
<LD>   The government mandates--which include a controversial airwave
sale and a $1-billion telephone number conservation plan--are likely
to boost monthly bills and disrupt service for the nation's 135
million cellular subscribers. They also are likely to increase the
red ink in a hotly competitive wireless industry in which six
national carriers are waging price wars amid slowing consumer demand.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the check writing will start next month when the
Federal Communications Commission, over the objections of big
wireless carriers, plans to begin auctioning $2.6 billion of wireless
airwaves. The sale has been delayed five times.</LD>
<TE>   Carriers desperately need the spectrum. But they say the auction
should be postponed until the airwaves' current users--several dozen
TV stations--relocate at their own expense. Many station owners--such
as Paxson Communications Corp. of West Palm Beach, Fla.--are
demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation from
wireless providers to finance their move.</TE>
<TE>   Another big bill may come due by July 24. That is when the FCC
must determine whether it will grant the industry an exemption from a
1996 FCC rule that requires wireless phone companies to conserve the
allocation of new phone numbers, in part by allowing existing
customers to keep their numbers if they switch carriers.</TE>
<TE>   FCC officials are divided over whether to extend the deadline
slightly to implement the technology, which is estimated to cost $900
million. But the industry is unlikely to receive a significant delay,
since the FCC already has extended the so-called number portability
deadline for nearly three years.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry has known for years that that requirement is there,"
FCC Commissioner Michael J. Copps said. "I think it is doable and
it's time to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Copps is equally hard-line about holding the spectrum auctions
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "An argument could be made that this isn't a great time to [have
an auction], but we are here to implement the laws of Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Many industry executives and analysts said that integrating TV
airwaves into new wireless service will be problematic, since
carriers can't be certain when TV stations will move to different
airwaves. And they warn that giving consumers the option to keep
their phone numbers when they switch carriers could deepen the
industry's financial woes by sending the industry's 30% customer
turnover rate even higher.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have intense price competition, and when you combine
that with number portability, the impact will be devastating," said
Roger Entner, a wireless analyst at Boston consulting firm Yankee
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Entner said consumers will hop from carrier to carrier in search
of the best deal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to get really ugly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Passing Costs On to the Customers</TE>
<TE>   Carriers seem to think so, and many are preparing for the worst.</TE>
<TE>   Nextel Communications Corp. already is imposing a 55-cent monthly
surcharge on subscribers to pay the cost of number portability and
associated services, and the company warns that the fee could go
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no federal cost-recovery mandate for these"
government-ordered services, said Lawrence Krevor, Nextel's vice
president of government relations. "It certainly is going to be
expensive for everyone.... [Fifty-five cents] is not full cost
recovery by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Wireless carrier Sprint PCS recently warned the FCC that it will
cost the company $94.5 million to implement number portability and
associated technology to conserve phone numbers. And once in place,
the system will cost $52.7 million to operate during the first two
years.</TE>
<TE>   The magnitude of the spending, Sprint said, could jeopardize the
introduction of eagerly awaited new technology, such as high-speed
wireless Internet access over cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed at the potential costs, some carriers are waging a furious
lobbying battle to avoid compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Verizon Wireless Inc., Cingular Wireless and other
carriers persuaded House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) to introduce a bill to delay the airwave
auction.</TE>
<TE>   The measure received preliminary support in a committee vote last
week but faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where a similar
measure has been introduced. Meanwhile, carriers also are undertaking
an 11th-hour lobbying campaign at the FCC, seeking to get
commissioners to relax their stance on number portability.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Verizon met with FCC Commissioner Kevin Martin
on April 12 and warned that cellular text messaging services and
other features "may not work between carriers," according to a
summary of the meeting published by the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, a Republican, remains on the fence about whether to grant
the industry extra time. But FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell and
fellow Republican Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy are telling
industry lobbyists they won't support lengthy delays and want
compliance within 12 months. Copps, meanwhile, is willing to give the
industry an additional 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting Stands on Service Compliance</TE>
<TE>   Dejected industry lobbyists said they aren't optimistic they can
avoid compliance much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we turn around, the government is seeking to impose a
new burden on the industry, and every burden they impose comes with a
big price tag," said Brian Fontes, a lobbyist for Cingular Wireless.
"They seem intent on imposing the requirement this time."</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the wireless industry's opposition to the FCC
mandates stands in contrast to traditional wire-line phone companies,
which largely have implemented the technology over the last three
years.</TE>
<TE>   But wireless executives said their task is difficult since
carriers use several competing transmission technologies. That makes
it more costly and more complex to quickly introduce nationwide
changes in the wireless network.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, phone executives argue that the initiatives--which
are aimed at boosting competition--are not needed because, unlike the
traditional phone industry, wireless already is hotly competitive,
with six national carriers battling for market share.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you need the rule if it was designed to increase
competition?" said Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular
Telecommunications &amp; Internet Assn., a Washington trade group. "Our
industry is already competitive. This is going to end up costing
every American wireless subscriber whether or not they use these
services."</TE>
<TE>   Wheeler was equally critical of having the airwave auctions next
month, saying that broadcasters would hold the wireless industry
financially hostage. "We're in the position of a lottery contestant
who is told, 'Congratulations! You just won. Now you get to have an
auction with the broadcasters" for your prize, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no excuse for broadcasters to be cheating consumers out
of higher-quality services," Wheeler added. "And there should
certainly not be a billion-dollar reward for broadcasters for
squatting on spectrum."</TE>

<HD>Wall Street Has Missed Before on Beat-Up Stocks</HD>
<DH>Markets: Recoveries by other companies from brink of
failure is a reminder that there's still hope for WorldCom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The deepening declines of WorldCom Inc.'s stock and bonds signal that
many investors fear bankruptcy for the troubled telecom provider.</LD>
<LD>   But could the market just be plain wrong?</LD>
<LD>   Though investors appear to be bracing for the possibility of a
Chapter 11 filing, the market "can and often does get it wrong," said
Robert Walberg, chief equity analyst at the investing Web site
Briefing.com in Chicago. "With these telecom stocks, the market had
it wrong on the other end a couple years ago, when they were riding
so high," he said.</LD>
<TE>   George Putnam, editor of the Turnaround Letter, a
"distressed-investing" newsletter based in Boston, pointed to
packaging maker Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., whose stock dived to less than
$1 in December on worries about its debt load and potential liability
from asbestos-related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Since then the shares have soared to $11.47 Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange, as the company has shed plants to trim costs.</TE>
<TE>   The market often gets it right, of course: Plenty of dot-com
stocks were marked down to penny levels ahead of the companies'
demise in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund manager Martin Whitman, who runs the Third Avenue
Value Fund in New York and specializes in distressed securities, said
that when he makes an investment he often has no clue whether the
company is headed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The California utilities are a perfect example," amid last year's
energy crisis, he said. "We bought the bonds of both. [The utility
arm of] PG&amp;E Corp. did file for Chapter 11, but Edison International
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Whitman said he started buying bonds of housewares maker Home
Products International Inc. in October 2000, thinking the company was
headed for bankruptcy reorganization. "Instead, nothing happened
except we've gotten our interest payments and done fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman steers clear of the common stock of distressed companies,
because those shareholders are at the bottom of the list when it
comes to being paid in the event of a bankruptcy, meaning they often
end up with nothing but a tax write-off.</TE>
<TE>   When analyzing distressed debt, Whitman said, he prepares for any
outcome: a bankruptcy liquidation, the worst case; a reorganization
in which debt holders get stock in the new company; and avoidance of
Chapter 11 altogether.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of WorldCom, Whitman said he is still crunching
numbers and reading company filings to determine whether to invest.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's 8.25% bonds maturing in 2031 fell to about 43 cents on
the dollar last week. On Friday the price closed at $42.89 per $100
face value.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating companies are reviewing the firm's debt for possible
downgrade to "junk," or below-investment-grade status, an outcome
that traders appear to be anticipating.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's stock has hit 10-year lows, closing at $1.79, down an
additional 24 cents Friday on Nasdaq amid growing fear about the
company's cash crunch.</TE>
<TE>   For a company like WorldCom, a spiraling market can become a
"self-fulfilling prophesy," said Blair Levin, a Legg Mason Inc.
telecom and media-regulatory analyst based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a dynamic at work when the stock is under this much
pressure: Your access to capital gets cut off, and WorldCom is in a
capital-intensive business," Levin said. "So even if the market is
'wrong,' it's right in that it shifts the momentum in that
direction."</TE>
<TE>   For individuals, distressed investing can be a minefield.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as complex an area as you can get," said Bruce Spector, a
partner at Apollo Management, an investment firm with offices in Los
Angeles and New York. "Determining whether a company can meet its
obligations is a hard call even for professionals to make, and it's
only one factor in the equation."</TE>
<TE>   In WorldCom's case, Putnam said one factor weighing on the
securities could be the numerous acquisitions the company made over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be more problems hidden in WorldCom than anyone
realizes," he said, noting that nervous investors have punished other
acquisitive companies recently as accounting fears have spread.</TE>
<TE>   Once stocks get hammered to penny-stock status, they can languish
for a long time. Networking giant Lucent Technologies Inc., for
example, has traded in single digits for about a year as its business
has continued to weaken, closing Friday at $4.40 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp., which plunged to $6 in November, rallied to more than
$11 in January, but since then the stock has flailed its way back to
$8.03 Friday on the NYSE. The copier maker is far from out of the
woods: Moody's Investors Service downgraded its debt last week amid
ongoing cash-flow concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems plaguing telecom, WorldCom and some of the
other hard-hit stocks and bonds in the sector may represent a good
risk-reward trade-off, say Putnam and other distressed-security
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "People were overly optimistic about WorldCom in the past and
they're overly pessimistic now," said Putnam, who has bought WorldCom
bonds as a money manager for private clients. "The truth may be
somewhere in between. My hunch is that they are a survivor."</TE>
<TE>   In his newsletter he recently recommended the stock of AT&amp;T
Wireless Services Inc., which closed Friday at $8.94 on the NYSE.
Based on his analysis of cash flow and debt load, Putnam believes it,
too, is a likely survivor.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Burns, an analyst at Metropolitan West Asset Management in
Los Angeles, said his firm recently bought bonds of WorldCom and
Qwest Communications International Inc. in its Metropolitan West
Total Return Bond fund.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's bonds already "are trading at less than a liquidation
scenario," he contends.</TE>
<TE>   Though a downgrade to junk status could force WorldCom to repay $2
billion within 90 days, essentially wiping out its cash on hand,
Burns said the company is negotiating with lenders to deactivate
those triggers.</TE>
<TE>   "To believe WorldCom is going away, you almost have to believe
that telecom services are going away, which isn't likely," he said,
noting that a big chunk of the company's revenue is from other large
companies, which don't change telecom providers often.</TE>
<TE>   Only $60 million of WorldCom's $30-billion debt load is due this
year, Burns said. Although $1.7 billion is due in 2003, the company
has $1.5 billion in cash and a $4.25-billion bank credit line
(excluding about $3.75 billion the company is likely to allow to
expire soon), and it is generating $1 billion in free cash flow per
year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts who like WorldCom at these prices aren't
backing up that opinion with cash.</TE>
<TE>   "My general feeling is that WorldCom will survive and the stock is
undervalued," Walberg said. "But I wouldn't buy it. Too risky."</TE>

<HD>Ovitz to Sell Talent Venture to the Firm</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Sale of Artists Management Group to
competitor would end the former Hollywood super-agent's attempt at a
comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Ovitz, once the reigning power player in Hollywood, has
aborted his ambitious comeback attempt, agreeing to sell the
higher-profile assets of his struggling talent management company to
a competitor.</LD>
<LD>   Undone as much by the industry's abiding animosity toward him as
by his own hubris, Ovitz on Sunday said he is ending a venture he
once claimed would reinvent Hollywood for the digital age.</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz imagined his new full-service venture, formed three years
ago, would make and distribute television shows and movies that his
artist clients would own and control. But without the support of much
of Hollywood, Ovitz could not sustain his ambitious plan.</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, Ovitz, 55, would sever all ties to his talent
management company, Artists Management Group, and its sister
companies, according to his AMG partners Rick Yorn, 33, and Julie
Silverman-Yorn, 36. AMG would cease to exist as a separate company,
instead being merged into the Firm, one of the largest music
management companies in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz, a former president of Walt Disney Co. and a founding
partner of leading talent firm Creative Artists Agency, declined to
comment on this deal or his future plans. The collapse of his venture
leaves Ovitz, still a multimillionaire, without a role in the
entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, he said the merged company "will be a very strong
entertainment and brand management company and will have the
resources to build a diverse and creative company. I wish the new
group all the success in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Ovitz helped to facilitate the merger, Rick Yorn said,
"It's not about Mike. It's about a new company moving forward." Ovitz
no longer is interested in being in the management business, Yorn
said, adding that he and his sister-in-law remain friendly with
Ovitz.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about buying us out of our contracts," Silverman-Yorn
said. "It's a merger."</TE>
<TE>   "It has not been an adversarial process," said Jeff Kwatinetz, the
37-year-old chief executive of the Firm.</TE>
<TE>   The Firm, which represents groups including Korn, Limp Bizkit and
the Dixie Chicks, would pay Ovitz a multimillion-dollar fee for his
share of AMG and would assume more than $10 million in AMG debt and
liabilities in exchange for a group of more than 40 managers, led by
the Yorns, according to sources close to the deal. That group
includes most of AMG's film, television and music staff as well as
those in the literary and publishing divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The Yorns said they expect their clients, including Cameron Diaz,
Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and Samuel L. Jackson, to move
with them to the Firm. Most of the rest of AMG's clients--Natalie
Portman, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ed Burns, Marisa Tomei and Dylan
McDermott--also are expected to join them at the Firm.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear what Ovitz's personal clients, including Martin
Scorsese, Sydney Pollack, Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton, would do
after the sale of AMG.</TE>
<TE>   The other AMG divisions--an animation company led by Ellen
Goldsmith Vein, a film production company led by former Columbia
Pictures Chairman Mark Canton, a sports management company and Chris
Lighty's Violator Music in New York--would be spun off into
stand-alone companies. The animation company, in particular, is
considering other opportunities, including merging with another
company. Ovitz plans to have no stakes in the resulting companies.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Ovitz's entertainment companies employed more than 300
people and took up three floors in Georges Marciano's building at the
corner of Beverly and Wilshire. Now they have fewer than 100
employees. High-profile clients including Robin Williams and Oliver
Stone have left the company, although the clients represented by the
Yorns remained with AMG throughout its short life.</TE>
<TE>   The Firm would not assume any liabilities for Ovitz's failed
television ventures. Last fall he shuttered Artists Television Group
after sinking a reported $100 million into television programming
development and production. Recently, Ovitz was sued for $9.6 million
by the head of that division, who claimed Ovitz made "grandiose
promises" and "false representations" when he hired him.</TE>
<TE>   Kwatinetz would remain the Firm's CEO with Yorn assuming the title
of co-chairman of the board and Silverman-Yorn sitting on the Firm's
Executive Committee. "We'll run it together," Kwatinetz said. "I
don't think of the Firm as my company."</TE>
<TE>   It has not been determined where the merged companies would set up
shop, but it is clear that neither Ovitz's high-rise suite of offices
nor the Firm's loft space on Wilshire Boulevard would be large enough
to house everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Yorn said the details of exactly who would be moving over to the
Firm will be worked out "over the next 48 hours."</TE>
<TE>   "The essential thing," said Kwatinetz, "is this is a group of
people who want to have fun and work together. When I met Rick and
Julie a couple of years ago, it was clear they work very similarly to
the way we work. We're good friends. We look at business the same
way. We want to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   The merged companies would be able to grow based on their ongoing
businesses, according to the partners. "The [Firm] is in great
financial shape," Kwatinetz said. "We're not looking for investors."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the Firm's four years of business, Ted Waitt, Gateway
Inc.'s 39-year-old founder, "made a small investment," Kwatinetz
said. Waitt remains a financial partner.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Kwatinetz talked to billionaire television
mogul Haim Saban about possibly investing in the Firm. "Jeff is what
was interesting," said Saban, who, after selling his stake in Fox
Family Channel, now ABC Family Channel, is looking to invest in the
talent representation business.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff's looking to build a multifaceted entertainment company,"
Saban said, noting that Kwatinetz told him he wants to build the next
AOL Time Warner. Saban said he wants to focus solely on the talent
representation niche. "You need a few billion dollars to do what he
wants to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding a far more modest tone with this announcement, Kwatinetz
said he's focused on merging the companies for now. The combined
companies--with roughly 200 people total--could do a better job
representing clients, he said. Measured by the number of managers,
the combined companies would be the largest management company in the
music and film businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The Firm now has 130 employees with headquarters in Los Angeles
and offices in Nashville and London. In addition to its more than 20
music clients, the Firm represents such actors as Martin Lawrence and
Vin Diesel. It also has an active film production company and a
consumer products division, owning the Pony brand of sportswear.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn, Kwatinetz moved to Los Angeles in the early
1990s and opened Q Management, a music management company.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Kwatinetz took his most promising client, the
rock band Korn, with him to Sandy Gallin's management company,
Gallin/Morey. After a flurry of lawsuits, Kwatinetz left Gallin, who
declined to comment on his former employee.</TE>
<TE>   After signing music sensation Limp Bizkit, Kwatinetz opened the
Firm. With the addition of the Back Street Boys as a client,
Kwatinetz established himself as a major power in the music industry.</TE>

<HD>Where to Swap Till You Drop</HD>
<DH>In South American countries such as Chile and Argentina,
barter clubs form a booming parallel economy for those short of cash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VALPARAISO, Chile</DL>
<LD>In certain neighborhoods of this bohemian port city, you can get your
teeth cleaned, have your hot-water heater fixed or munch on a loaf of
homemade bread without spending any money.</LD>
<LD>   All you need are a few "talents."</LD>
<LD>   That's the name the Valparaiso bartering club has given to its
official "currency," little beige certificates that resemble the
Community Chest cards in a Monopoly game. A club member might pay you
30 talentos if you fix her kitchen faucet. Take those talentos to the
Wednesday night bartering fair, and you can trade them for jars of
homemade preserves (two talentos each) or some jewelry (five talentos
and up).</LD>
<TE>   With money in short supply here and elsewhere across South
America, barter (known as trueque in Spanish) is the engine driving a
thriving parallel economy in which millions of dollars' worth of
goods and services circulate in a self-perpetuating stream of
cashless exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Bartering clubs such as the one in Valparaiso can also be found in
the rural towns of Argentina's southern region of Patagonia, in the
impoverished suburbs of Buenos Aires (which has more than 60 clubs)
and in slightly better-off communities in Uruguay and Brazil. In an
era of scarcity and social upheaval, South America's barter fairs are
a home-grown remedy for empty cupboards and frustrated shoppers,
especially among the poor and the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   "It bothers me that everything in our society revolves around
money," said Christian Palma, explaining why he helped launch
Valparaiso's barter fair two years ago. "We're trying to reinvent the
idea of a marketplace and create new types of social ties."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is pleased by the spread of the clubs, which were
founded in the late 1990s but have been adding members at a rapid
pace in the turbulent economic climate of the past year. A few
observers see in the trueque explosion a sign that the region's
economy is coming apart, even as some merchants feel that they're
being hurt by unfair competition.</TE>
<TE>   In some communities hit hard by unemployment and recession, barter
has spread beyond the clubs. The city government of Allen, near the
Andes in south-central Argentina, allows residents to pay their
municipal taxes by bartering.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are going through hard times, who are unemployed or
underemployed, can cover their city debts with goods or services,"
said Mirta Diomedi, the municipal finance secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Nine in 10 Allen residents are in default on their city taxes, and
the local government is so cash-poor that it recently had its phones
cut off. Now backyard mechanics can pay off their taxes by fixing
city-owned trucks. A man with a Xerox machine churned out hundreds of
copies in lieu of 120 pesos in taxes (about $40).</TE>
<TE>   Argentina is home to the continent's largest bartering fairs, with
about 1million members in a nationwide "Barter Solidarity Network."
Trueque boomed in Argentina after the government partially froze most
savings accounts late last year and began declaring intermittent bank
holidays that forced most Argentines to empty out their wallets to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   "The only miracle the crisis has produced in Argentina is el
trueque," said Exequiel Fernandez, a board member of the barter club
in Rio Colorado in Patagonia. "Need has created this," he said one
recent Sunday at the club's fair.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's crisis is only the most extreme case of a
continentwide phenomenon that has seen most governments slash budgets
and devalue their currencies.</TE>
<TE>   In such a climate, doing business without money has a certain
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of sitting around, waiting for the crisis to end, a group
of people has created this social currency," said Ivan Cabezas, a
university professor in Santiago, the Chilean capital, and a
participant in a barter fair there. "Between the members of the
[barter] group, there's a sense of solidarity that is not often felt
in our society."</TE>
<TE>   To others, however, the spread of barter is just another reminder
of how grim and desperate times have become, and a sign that Latin
America is regressing to its economic childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Returning to these primitive forms of commerce, which belong to
an era in which a common currency didn't exist or wasn't trustworthy,
is in no way a positive development," the influential Buenos Aires
daily La Nacion offered in a March editorial.</TE>
<TE>   Most barter fairs are organized by neighborhood activists of
varying stripes. For them, trueque is, all at once, a grass-roots
rebuff to U.S. commercialism, a self-help alternative to charity and
government handouts, and a way to rebuild a sense of community.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is that you have to put something in to get something
back," said Palma of the Valparaiso bartering club.</TE>
<TE>   Palma started the trueque club with 10 other people. Working to
build the fair to its current 300 members has been a bit like
watching a laboratory on human behavior. He's been able to see how
ideas about merchandise and value shift once people begin shopping
not with cash or credit cards, but with talentos, or with baskets of
homemade pies.</TE>
<TE>   "When people first come to barter, they're embarrassed," he said.
In the non-barter world, money equals power and prestige. But at the
barter fair, money doesn't buy anything. Instead, you bring what you
don't need, or whatever skill you might have.</TE>
<TE>   In some of the "purest" barter fairs, not even used goods are
acceptable for trading--only the products of one's own labor can be
sold. That sort of ethic presented Palma, an environmental engineer,
with a small problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, there's not much of a demand for my services as an
environmental engineer," he said, matter-of-factly. "So I bake bread
instead."</TE>
<TE>   On fair days, Palma brings a basket of whole-wheat buns to a
meeting room at a church here.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 people showed up recently, arranging home-grown herbs,
jewelry and other goods on three long tables. There were some old
toys, too--the club long ago gave up the restriction on used goods.</TE>
<TE>   Most people work in pairs: a husband manning the sales table, for
example, while his wife shops with her talentos.</TE>
<TE>   "The Buzz Lightyear is gone already," Manolo Sierralta said to a
small boy who approached his toy collection. The boy began to cry
uncontrollably. His mother tried to calm him down by buying another
toy, a small truck that cost a "half talento."</TE>
<TE>   The talento is printed with an Inca-style drawing of a man holding
an ear of corn. All people who join the club get 10 talentos.
Membership is free.</TE>
<TE>   In the Argentine town of Rio Colorado, the barter currency is
called a credit, or credito.</TE>
<TE>   Fair organizers estimate that about 60,000 creditos are in
circulation in Rio Colorado, home to about 15,000 people at the
northern fringe of Patagonia. The town has two bartering fairs with
1,000 families as members. Most clubs require membership as a way to
enforce rules, including the most common one: Everyone must bring
something to sell.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday afternoons, hundreds of people descend on the site of
the largest fair, the main building of the town's business school.
Young mothers pedal in on bikes loaded with homemade cakes. Taxi
drivers--many of whom accept creditos for their fares--drop off
farmers with crates of apples, grapes and plums.</TE>
<TE>   Young porters--also paid in credits--help the sellers carry their
goods to a series of long tables inside. Two tall bulletin boards
list all the local service providers who have signed up to offer
their labor for barter, including four doctors, about two dozen
bricklayers and 40 housecleaners.</TE>
<TE>   "I signed up because I wanted to lend a hand to the community,"
said Beatriz Santamaria, an orthodontist. But only a handful of
people have called her up to barter. "People take the credits they
have and buy only essential things, like food," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Mariana Altieri takes to a microphone and announces, "Let the
trueque begin," the aisles between the tables become as crowded as a
Macy's on Christmas Eve. People jostle to line up at the most popular
table of all, the one stacked with the loaves of bread.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the bartering club pooled its resources to "buy" 220
pounds of bread from a local baker in exchange for half a ton of
firewood the club had acquired in previous trades--the baker used the
wood to fire his oven.</TE>
<TE>   Blacksmith Jose Nunez can usually fill his refrigerator and pantry
with what he buys at the fair. He earns credits by selling things
such as portable barbecues, which he offers at a mixed price of 10
credits and 10 pesos. He has also performed a few jobs outside the
fair--installing steel security fences and such--at the same mixed
price.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't buy the steel with credits," he said. No steel mill he
knows of will accept barter. "So I have people pay me cash for the
materials and credits for the labor."</TE>
<TE>   So many goods are being bought and sold at the Rio Colorado fair,
it's begun to generate concern among local merchants, who fear that
their struggling businesses will lose even more customers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard that they're selling [homemade] sausages and pasta,"
said Juan Jose Reiser, head of Rio Colorado's chamber of commerce.
"If a business is forced to comply with certain standards of hygiene,
then why shouldn't these people do the same?"</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns haven't slowed the growth of the barter fairs,
although they have led some Argentine legislators to propose laws to
regulate the clubs. In Chile, the government is trying to tax them.</TE>
<TE>   After less than two hours of frenzied shopping by club members,
most tables at the Rio Colorado fair are empty. People carry out
their purchases in the same baskets and bags they used to bring
things to sell.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz of activity stands in contrast to the dramatic decline in
the region's agriculture-based economy. Trees wither inside abandoned
apple orchards at the edge of town.</TE>
<TE>   The economic panorama is only slightly less bleak in Buenos Aires.
The affluent neighborhood of Palermo hosts a swanky trueque at which
antique china might be traded for cuts of prime Argentine beef. Used
cars are sometimes sold for creditos, as are time shares in vacation
homes.</TE>
<TE>   But there is mostly food and used clothes on offer in the
Argentine town of General Conesa, an hour's drive south of Rio
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The fair was started by a group of women, all teachers. The public
school system in their province is broke, and the women are owed
several months' back pay. They've been on strike, off and on, for
weeks. One day they decided to organize a barter fair to keep
themselves occupied.</TE>
<TE>   As the fair grew--it now has 177 members--so did the need for
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first got started, it was more orderly," said Elena
Harismendi, one of the founders. "You didn't have to yell and be
authoritarian with people to keep order."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone wears an ID badge now. And the club draws numbers to see
who gets to shop first.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, you would get people pushing each other to get to the
things people wanted to buy the most," said Liliana Corbellini,
another of the group's founders.</TE>
<TE>   Corbellini sends the credits she earns in General Conesa to her
son, a university student in the city of Tandil. He uses the credits
to buy food at Tandil's bartering fair.</TE>
<TE>   "He says that three or four days each week he eats from the
credits I send him," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, at her home, she offers a piece of the cake she bought at
the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Then some toast covered with marmalade she bought there. And
finally a drink from a mate, a steel cup used to drink the tea of the
same name.</TE>
<TE>   "I got that at the trueque too," she said.</TE>

<HD>2 Sides Forge Plan to End Church Siege</HD>
<DH>Bethlehem: Israelis and Palestinians near a deal that would
send some inside the holy site to Italy and Gaza Strip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israelis and Palestinians agreed Sunday on the broad outlines of a
deal to end the monthlong siege of the Church of the Nativity by
exiling a number of Palestinians accused of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiators appeared on the verge of signing the accord early
today.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough came only a few days after the U.S., the European
Union and the Vatican stepped up pressure to end the standoff between
armed Palestinians and Israeli forces at one of Christianity's
holiest sites.</LD>
<TE>   Six to 15 Palestinians inside the church who are on Israel's most
wanted list would be sent to Italy as "temporary visitors," according
to one Palestinian official. An additional 35 to 40 men would be sent
to the Gaza Strip. The rest of the 123 men inside would go free.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis and Palestinians said the exact numbers of men involved
were the last obstacle to signing the deal, which they hoped to
finalize today. But both sides said the basic structure of the deal
had already been agreed to. The actual transfer of the men is to
begin soon after the accord is signed.</TE>
<TE>   "Progress has been made, but there's no deal yet. They're still
talking," a top Israeli security official said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians in the church said early today that they had been
told by their leaders that their 35-day ordeal would end within
hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope most of us will walk home. I hope this will be resolved
this morning," said Mohammed Madani, the Bethlehem region's
Palestinian governor, who has been in the church almost from the
beginning of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks and armored personnel carriers were rumbling through
this ancient city's winding streets before dawn today, apparently in
preparation for the evacuation and transfer of men. Soldiers began
erecting a barricade between a swarm of reporters and the entrance to
the 4th century basilica. Israel Radio reported that the army had
arrested 13 Palestinians in Bethlehem, including a senior Hamas
activist.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff at the church is the last unresolved crisis remaining
from Israel's massive assault on the West Bank. In the last month,
Israeli troops invaded nearly every Palestinian city there in their
search for "terrorist cells," waging fierce door-to-door combat in
many places.</TE>
<TE>   An end to the Bethlehem siege would clear the way for a new stage
in Palestinian-Israeli relations, which have been severely damaged by
the assault. Focus would then shift to a proposed peace conference
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Troops entered Bethlehem in force April 2, prompting Palestinian
gunmen, militants and civilians to seek refuge in the church, which
Christians believe marks the birthplace of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Monks, Nuns, Priests</TE>
<TE>   and Armed Men Inside</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 200 Palestinians, many of them armed, wound up in the
compound, whose thick, fortress-like walls have withstood centuries
of warfare. Three Christian faiths share responsibility for the
compound, which includes monasteries, chapels and a hostel.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians were joined by about 80 monks, nuns and priests,
who found themselves in the difficult position of providing sanctuary
to armed men in the middle of some of the deadliest
Israeli-Palestinian fighting in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli tanks quickly took up positions in adjoining Manger
Square. Snipers filled the surrounding buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis justified the military presence by saying that at
least 10 of the men inside were wanted terrorists, including members
of militant groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade has been responsible for the majority
of suicide bombings and attacks on Israeli citizens since the current
uprising began in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to force the men out, the Israelis limited the
supply of food and water to the church compound and played loud music
to deprive the men of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Snipers killed at least seven of the Palestinians and wounded
others.</TE>
<TE>   As the weeks dragged on, negotiations seemed to go nowhere. Small
groups of men and boys exited the church, weak from hunger. On
Thursday, 10 activists ran into the church with food, accompanied by
Los Angeles Times photographer Carolyn Cole.</TE>
<TE>   Sketchy Details About</TE>
<TE>   Men on Wanted List</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, there were 123 Palestinians left inside, along with
about 30 Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox
clerics. Cole could not be contacted today, but she and the activists
remained in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Details about the fate of the men wanted by Israel remained
sketchy.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis have long insisted that the men go into exile or face
justice in Israel. The Palestinians want the men to go on trial in
Palestinian territory. They have suggested that the U.S. or another
third party monitor proceedings to calm Israeli fears of a show
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night, a senior Palestinian official was reportedly headed
for Italy to finalize details about the exile of the six most wanted
men. Three of the men were identified by Israeli media as Ibrahim
Abeiyat, Abdallah Daud Kader and Rafat Jaara.</TE>
<TE>   Abeiyat is head of the local Al Aqsa brigade, one of the leaders
of a large and violent family whose members have been linked by
Israel to several attacks. Daud is the local head of Palestinian
military intelligence. Jaara has been accused by the Israelis of
helping carry out terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Daud, reached inside the church today, refused to confirm that he
was going to Italy. But he said at least six men were headed there.
It was unclear why Italy was selected as an exile destination for the
men, or whether they might face judicial proceedings there.</TE>
<TE>   It was also unclear whether the men going to Gaza would face trial
under the Palestinian justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to end the standoff grew when the Bush administration
became alarmed after a gunfight and two serious fires broke out
Wednesday night at the church, diplomats said. Pope John Paul II also
sent a special envoy last week.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of phone calls along the way, but they
became especially urgent [Thursday]," a Western diplomat said. The
fires and shootings "opened people's eyes on the other side of the
ocean."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and European Union stepped up their involvement Sunday,
as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon headed to Washington to meet
with President Bush and top administration figures.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats helped broker an exchange of information on the
identities of the 123 men holed up in the church, allowing Israel to
determine who should be freed and who should face punitive action.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sides Motivated</TE>
<TE>   to End the Standoff</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts speculated that Sharon wanted a deal to be reached
before he meets with Bush on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Resolving the standoff was a major goal for Arafat, too. Only a
short while after being released from his own monthlong siege, Arafat
angrily proclaimed that resolving the situation at the church was one
of his top priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli media reported that the first indication of a breakthrough
came late Sunday, when Arafat called Madani, the governor, in the
church to tell him to begin preparing for an orderly and peaceful
evacuation. The Vatican and the European Union apparently framed the
deal to have the men exiled to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   There were fears that some of the Palestinians might resist
deportation, preferring instead a bloody death in the church to turn
it into a symbol of the Palestinian cause. But those inside said such
worries were baseless.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no problems in implementing what will be decided"
in the negotiations, said Daud, whom the Israelis accuse of
involvement in numerous terrorist attacks. "All will compromise, and
all will accept and abide."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians in the church said they did not want to leave if
Israeli tanks and troops were standing guard outside. Palestinian
police officials were reportedly taking up positions around Manger
Square to maintain order.</TE>
<TE>   Priests were reported to be planning a tour of the church today.
Cole and others who have been in the church say mosaics dating to the
time of the Crusaders have been damaged by gunfire, windows shattered
and stone columns pockmarked with bullet holes.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French President Jacques Chirac sailed to a resounding reelection
victory Sunday over far-right candidate Jean- Marie Le Pen,
capitalizing on high turnout and crossover leftist votes to block a
surprise extremist challenge that had provoked an uproar.</LD>
<LD>   Chirac, a veteran leader of the center-right, won 81.9% of the
vote to Le Pen's 18.1% in the runoff presidential election, according
to official results with 96% of ballots counted. Le Pen's showing was
much weaker than had been expected, given his strong showing in
first-round voting April 21 when he won 17%, placed second to Chirac
and beat out Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and 13 other
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Chirac's lopsided win Sunday indicated that an extraordinary wave
of leftist-dominated street protests in the last two weeks had halted
the momentum of Le Pen, a pugnacious 73-year-old ex-paratrooper with
a history of neo-fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant activism.
Le Pen's failure to substantially improve his numbers suggests that
his upset last month did not result from a surge of political
extremism but rather from voter discontent with a political elite
seen as aloof and unresponsive on delicate issues: rising crime,
persistent unemployment and social conflict involving Muslim
immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   In his televised victory speech, Chirac acknowledged that the
strange and raucous campaign revealed a national crisis, but he said
the French had reaffirmed their values at a vital moment in their
history.</TE>
<TE>   "I salute France, faithful to itself, faithful to its ideals,"
Chirac said. "I salute the French, fond of solidarity and liberty,
eager to open up to Europe and the world. . . . I have heard and
understood your appeal for the republic to endure, the nation to
unify, politics to change."</TE>
<TE>   Chirac, 69, has a lot of work to do. He was elected president in
1995, capping a three-decade career during which he served as prime
minister and as mayor of Paris. Especially after recent corruption
scandals, voters see the tall, suave and perpetually tanned president
as charming but untrustworthy, according to polls.</TE>
<TE>   The French are weary of government gridlock. For five years, a
center-left government has been teamed in an uneasy "co-habitation"
with the more conservative Chirac, diluting the formidable powers of
the presidency. With Jospin set to resign as prime minister as soon
as today, Chirac must quickly put together a government that shakes
off the Le Pen scare and takes vigorous action.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first moves, according to well-informed police
officials, will be the creation of a "super ministry" to overhaul a
demoralized law enforcement system that is the top concern of the
French today.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberty is security, the fight against violence, the denial of
impunity," Chirac said. "Beating back insecurity is the top priority
of the state for the future."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to anti-crime measures that may give him an air of
president-as-sheriff, Chirac promised to cut taxes and bureaucracy,
spur economic growth and fight discrimination in all its forms. Along
with pointed references to intolerance and extremism, that was as
close as he came to mentioning his longtime nemesis Le Pen, whom
Chirac is known to despise.</TE>
<TE>   The president must also gird for June legislative elections in
which he hopes to take control of the National Assembly. Although the
center-right's chances look good, the strong 80% voter turnout Sunday
indicates that leftist voters flocked to the polls. That could mean
that the left has begun to recover from the apathy and division that
led to the startling defeat of Jospin, political analysts say.
Turnout in the first round of presidential balloting was about 72%, a
near-record low.</TE>
<TE>   "Chirac was not elected because of a platform but a simple
mandate: Fully revive democracy," said Francois Holland, the first
secretary of the Socialist Party, insisting that the left was crucial
to the outcome. Looking to next month's elections, Holland called for
a continuing mobilization of a new anti-Le Pen coalition encompassing
"the forces of youth, labor and culture who went into action during
recent days."</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen's National Front does not appear likely to win more than a
few legislative seats; it currently has none. Still, the far right's
proven appeal to former Communist voters will affect the policies of
the future government, regardless of its composition.</TE>
<TE>   Although Le Pen had virtually no chance of victory Sunday, even
some government officials had expected him to add conservative votes
and pull in close to 25%. The volcanic Le Pen, who lost an eye in a
brawl years ago and seems on the verge of throwing a punch most of
the time, reacted with trademark defiance. Speaking at his
headquarters on a hill in suburban St. Cloud just west of Paris, he
blamed mainstream politicians, the media and the left.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a harsh defeat of French hope," Le Pen said.
"Nonetheless, we are above our numbers in the first round. The
victory of Jacques Chirac is a misleading victory acquired with a
Soviet method using the ensemble of all the social, political,
economic [and] media forces."</TE>
<TE>   The first-round bombshell by the National Front shook up one of
the blandest presidential races in memory. The French had assumed
that April 21 would produce a showdown between Chirac and Jospin,
aging warhorses whose policies did not differ markedly. According to
pollster Pierre Giacometti, it looked to be a personality duel
between leaders representing two iconic sides of the French
character: Jospin, the stern and cerebral "Cartesian"; and Chirac,
the gregarious and roguish "Latin."</TE>
<TE>   But Le Pen trampled past the Socialists. He became France's first
far-right contender in a presidential runoff partly by moderating his
famously thuggish style. He played down his shoving matches with
rivals and crude comments such as his remark that the Holocaust was a
"minor detail" of history.</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen stood out among the campaign's colorless political lifers
and remote intellectuals who seemed physiologically incapable of
talking bluntly about tough issues. He scored points with
working-class voters worried about 9% unemployment, loss of economic
control to globalizing forces such as the European Union, and the
intertwined threats of rising lawlessness and the society's
difficulties in integrating North African immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac won only 19% of the vote in the first round, the worst
showing in French history by an incumbent. But he responded to the
challenge with the dignity and determination that make him
presidential in the eyes of many voters.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, he reached out to the rivals--Socialists, Trotskyites
and Greens--who helped him win despite their ideological distaste for
him. His words and actions appeared to signal that he realizes the
French have had it with politics-as-usual and want action, not just
slogans.</TE>
<TE>   Braving the cold and rain late Sunday, Chirac and his wife,
Bernadette, made an unusual crowd-pleasing appearance in the Place de
la Republique in front of soggy but jubilant partisans. Chirac's
second speech of the night was a kind of national pep talk. His
breath steaming in the night, he congratulated the French for
refusing "to cede to the temptation of intolerance and demagoguery."</TE>

<LD>A delegation of U.S. lawmakers met Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri on Sunday to rally support for a proposed international
conference aimed at bringing Israel and the Palestinians to the
negotiating table.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said last week that
Washington was preparing for a Middle East peace conference this
summer, although the White House later said the forum would probably
not propose a final settlement.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a good extended discussion about the secretary of State's
initiative and our country's efforts to bring about a stop in
violence in the Middle East and a resumption of negotiations toward a
fair and lasting settlement," Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.) said after
meeting Hariri.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has welcomed the
idea but says he wants to consult Arab leaders before accepting.
Israel said it was seeking more details from the United States.

Suu Kyi will be permitted to travel the country and resume political
activities.</DH>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest by
Myanmar's military rulers for much of the last decade, was freed
today and left her home without restrictions for the first time in 19
months.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving at midday at the Yangon headquarters of her party, the
National League for Democracy, the 56-year-old pro-democracy leader
was greeted by more than 1,000 supporters chanting, "long live Suu
Kyi."</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Suu Kyi, who has long opposed military rule, would
be permitted to travel freely and resume speaking out on political
matters. "As of today, she is at liberty to carry out all activities,
including her party's," a government spokesman told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Suu Kyi's supporters had insisted that she be released without any
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The government also said it would continue releasing some of an
estimated 1,800 political prisoners it is holding, many of whom are
members of Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We shall recommit ourselves to allowing all of our citizens to
participate freely in the life of our political process, while giving
priority to national unity, peace and stability of the country as
well as the region," the military government said in a statement
released in both Yangon and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement, following months of negotiations with military
rulers and Suu Kyi by United Nations envoy Razali Ismail, signals the
regime's desire to end the country's isolation and persuade the
international community to lift economic sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   The country, formerly known as Burma, has been under strong
pressure from Washington to release Suu Kyi and other political
prisoners. The United States and other nations have imposed economic
sanctions on Myanmar that have left the dictatorship largely isolated
from the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Western critics say the impoverished country's rulers have
survived in large part by relying on the illegal opium trade.</TE>
<TE>   A former British colony, Myanmar has been run by the military
since 1962. In 1988, the regime put down a pro-democracy uprising by
killing hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   The government called parliamentary elections in 1990, but after
the National League for Democracy won in a landslide, the military
refused to let Suu Kyi take power. Arrested in 1989, the charismatic
daughter of independence leader Aung San was held under house arrest
until 1995. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   She was placed under house arrest again in September 2000 after
she twice attempted to travel outside Yangon, the capital city
formerly known as Rangoon, and has been held for the last 19 months.</TE>
<TE>   Although no official announcement of her release was made, word
spread quickly and a throng of supporters gathered at her party
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   She arrived in a white Toyota and was mobbed by the cheering
crowd. Some of her supporters linked arms to hold the crowd back and
form an aisle so she could enter the building.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials and party leaders had hinted for days that
she would be released. The government statement does not mention her
by name but says the country will celebrate "a day of national unity"
by taking "a series of steps."</TE>
<TE>   "We have released nearly 600 detainees in recent months and shall
continue to release those who will cause no harm to the community,
nor threaten the existing peace, stability and unity of the nation,"
the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy advocates said earlier that the government had released
about 200 of an estimated 2,000 political prisoners in recent months.
The government's higher figure might include the release of detainees
not considered to be political prisoners by the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats say the regime was compelled to seek
international assistance because it has run the country into the
ground during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Universities have been closed more often than they have been open,
and libraries have been shut. Health care has sharply deteriorated,
and doctors have little contact with medical advances in the West.
The banking system is near collapse, diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   While the families of the military rulers drive expensive foreign
cars, the public transportation system is so near collapse that
rickety buses crammed to capacity carry loads of passengers sitting
on top as well as inside.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens are denied access to the Internet. Cellular phones are
virtually unheard of.</TE>
<TE>   The government's statement indicates that the military rulers are
ready to seek help from the outside world. It said it would join
other nations to combat terrorism and AIDS, and fight for the "total
eradication of narcotic drugs which are threatening mankind."</TE>
<TE>   "Today marks a new page for the people of Myanmar and the
international community," the statement said. "As we look forward to
a better future, we will work toward greater international stability
and improving the welfare of our diverse people."</TE>

<HD>Dossier on Arafat Is Sharon's Ammunition</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In U.S. visit, the Israeli prime minister plans to
use documents linking his archfoe to terrorism to argue that the
Palestinian is no partner for peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will make the rounds in
Washington today, embarking on another quest to eliminate Yasser
Arafat from the Israeli-Palestinian equation.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with a 103-page dossier that Israel says links Arafat to
terrorism, Sharon will argue in meetings today with Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld and Tuesday with President Bush that Arafat cannot
be a partner to any peace agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon also plans to outline to Bush his own peace plan. Details
that have leaked out indicate that it repeats positions that the
Palestinians--and, in some cases, the Americans--have already
rejected as nonstarters, including Sharon's desire to keep intact
most, if not all, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   But the focus of Sharon's fifth meeting with Bush will be Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Having failed to oust the Palestinian Authority president with a
massive military offensive and 34-day siege of his West Bank
headquarters, Sharon is now mounting a political campaign that he
hopes will galvanize world opinion, or at least Washington opinion,
against Arafat. Sharon may no longer be able to deport Arafat, as he
had hoped, but he still wants to completely sideline the Palestinian
leader.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Israeli officials, with great fanfare, on Sunday
publicized the report compiled by Sharon's government and
intelligence services. It contains numerous invoices, memos and other
documents that Israeli officials say the army seized in raids on
Arafat's offices and those of his top aides.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the documents, whose authenticity has not been
independently verified, have already been reported on widely. The
difference now is that they've been gathered together in a single
dossier--with a red-lettered cover page and pictures of a defiant
Arafat. Israeli officials assert that the booklet is damning evidence
of Arafat's complicity in fatal attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope we will be able to convince the United States of
America and the European countries that the main problem, the main
stumbling block on the way to peace, is Yasser Arafat," Cabinet
Minister Danny Naveh said in presenting the report to a room full of
Israeli and foreign journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Translations from Arabic to English provided by Israeli officials
appeared generally accurate, even if the authenticity of the
documents could not be verified. There has been no way to follow the
chain of custody of the material, which Naveh said came primarily
from computer disks and hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials dismissed the Israeli campaign as pure
propaganda and charged that much, if not all, of the material was
fabricated.</TE>
<TE>   The documents appear to show payments authorized by Arafat to
activists in his Fatah movement and to militants in the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Fatah. One document dated Sept.
19, 2001, appears to indicate that Arafat authorized a $600 payment
to Raed Karmi, who boasted of killing Israelis, including two Tel
Aviv restaurateurs, before Israel killed him in January, and a
payment in the same amount to Ziad Mohammed Daas, a lieutenant to
Karmi whom Israel accuses of orchestrating a shooting attack on a bat
mitzvah a few days after Karmi's death.</TE>
<TE>   Another paper allegedly shows the authorization of $350 payments
to each of 12 Fatah activists who Israel said were involved in lethal
attacks on Israelis in the Tulkarm area of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   In each of the documents, Arafat appears to be responding to a
request for money from top Fatah officials, including Marwan
Barghouti, a key aide captured by Israel on April 15; the Palestinian
leader usually allotted a sum considerably smaller than the request.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli report acknowledges that Arafat paid money to hundreds
of Fatah members, only some of them implicated in terrorism. Further,
no document links Arafat to a specific act of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The dossier also includes inventories of weapons purportedly in
the Palestinian Authority's possession in violation of peace accords.
These include rocket-propelled antitank missiles and heavy-caliber
machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   Naveh, a minister without portfolio, said the Palestinian
Authority used money from European donor states to finance its budget
and "indirectly" pay for terrorist acts. He said two of Arafat's
closest associates, general intelligence chief Tawfiq Tirawi and top
financial officer Fuad Shubaki, were involved in arming Palestinian
militias.</TE>
<TE>   Naveh accused Iraq, Iran and Syria of supplying money to militias
and facilitating the smuggling of weapons. He noted that Saudi Arabia
has paid large amounts of money to the families of Palestinian
fighters killed by Israel, as well as to families of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The material, Naveh said, constitutes "clear-cut, hard evidence
that the Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat is supporting,
encouraging and is an actively operating body of terror."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet member Saeb Erekat responded angrily to the
Israeli allegations, saying the documents were forged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of a series of forgeries and lies to discredit
Arafat and the Palestinian Authority," Erekat said. "It seems that
the [Israeli] endgame is to destroy the Palestinian Authority and
Arafat and the peace process, and then say they don't have a
partner."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they had not yet examined Sharon's material. A
Western diplomat said it was to be expected that Israel would step up
the campaign to discredit Arafat in connection with Sharon's
Washington trip.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no guarantee that Sharon's strategy will work.</TE>
<TE>   There is no love lost for Arafat in the Bush administration--the
president has yet to invite the Palestinian Authority leader to the
White House--but U.S. officials have concluded that, at least for
now, Arafat is the chosen leader of the Palestinian people, the
"address" for Palestinian negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, he is riding an especially high wave of popularity,
having survived Sharon's siege and emerged like an aged phoenix from
the ruins of his Ramallah compound. Far from Arafat being made
irrelevant, as Sharon said was his goal, the Palestinian leader
became a cause celebre, and, for now, an important symbol of defiance
for both Palestinians and the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being told that he has to deal with Arafat, Sharon
might come under U.S. pressure to entertain political discussions
with the Palestinians, something the prime minister has adamantly
opposed while violence continues.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans want to revive the recommendations of a blue-ribbon
panel headed by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine). The panel's
report last year proposed a series of confidence-building measures,
such as a freeze on Jewish settlements, as important steps to reduce
violence and move toward a permanent resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Such issues are problematic for Sharon at home. He faces a central
committee meeting of his right-wing Likud Party about a week after he
returns from Washington. The committee is expected to vote against
the establishment of a Palestinian state, thereby tying Sharon's
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sharon's get-rid-of-Arafat viewpoint appeared to get a
boost Sunday from Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be very clear that the Palestinian leadership
that is there now, the Authority, is not the kind of leadership that
can lead to the kind of Palestinian state that we need," Rice said on
"Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leadership "has got to reform, it has got to make
changes in the security apparatus, in the constitution, in the way
that it leads," she said.</TE>

<HD>Azusa Puts Residents in Development Driver's Seat</HD>
<DH>Planning: They work with the city to oversee design of
housing, roads and parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Azusa long might have epitomized those aging blue-collar cities that
surround Los Angeles--acres and acres of tired, cookie-cutter homes
springing from onetime orange groves and honeybee farms. If some
force besides consumer demand modulated development, it was hard to
discern.</LD>
<LD>   But officials in the San Gabriel Valley suburb today are not only
taking community planning seriously, they are engaging residents in
ways previously employed only in tonier locales like Santa Monica and
Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   In a town best known for its historic drive-in theater and rock
quarries, average residents mix with city planners and urban
designers to determine the future look of their town. No longer
relegated to three-minute pleas before a City Council that would make
all the decisions, Azusans now help design roadways, parks, housing
and schools. And in a few months they will cast the crucial vote on
plans that will govern the city's development for decades.</LD>
<TE>   The approach is in marked contrast to planning in most cities,
where procedure calls for elected officials and bureaucrats to be
left mostly to their own devices in drawing up development plans.
Residents typically are summoned only to participate when the
guidelines are all but set in stone.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa is reforming the process, using as its laboratory the
development of Monrovia Nursery, a 500-acre hillside tract in
northeast Azusa and the largest undeveloped parcel in the San Gabriel
Valley, besides the rock quarries that dot the area.</TE>
<TE>   If the final plan for the nursery property is approved by voters
in November, it will become a template for a general plan for the
entire city.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is unknown if the planning process will produce
complete consensus among residents, city officials and land-use
experts said the effort shows that it is not only more upscale
communities that are capable of letting residents make planning
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're doing is not innovative if you're talking about the
usual litany of upscale cities," said William Fulton, a land-use
expert and author of books about Southern California urbanization.
"But it's unusual to see a city like Azusa aggressively creating a
sophisticated political environment where innovative ideas about
growth can go down market to older suburbs."</TE>
<TE>   Others said Azusa's planning ambitions show that the "new
urbanism," also known as "smart growth," can spread beyond those
affluent communities and newer, master-planned enclaves. Those terms
are generally used to describe the trend toward communities that
blend homes, shops, public spaces and mass transit--encouraging
residents to walk and interact.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an older town reinventing itself," said Azusa City Manager
Rick Cole. "We're not the best of the richest. We're the best of the
communities that look more like the majority of Southern California.
But we're benchmarking ourselves against the richest cities. We're
not going to be considered the armpit anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "New urbanism isn't about Starbucks, boutiques and artist lofts,"
Cole continued, "but an alternative to these towns turning into what
[author and Los Angeles social critic] Mike Davis warned would be
'crabgrass slums.'"</TE>
<TE>   Azusa's challenge is to preserve its most ambitious plans in a
situation where other middle-class suburbs have failed, Fulton said.
Older suburbs often bend to the pressure of developers and swelling
populations as they run out of open land, filling space with row upon
row of nearly identical homes rather than consulting residents about
what is most appropriate to shape their city's character.</TE>
<TE>   However, a more community-centered approach doesn't come cheap.
The city--which has the lowest median income of the seven Foothill
communities from Sierra Madre to Glendora--persuaded the nursery
owners to pay the bulk of the $500,000 cost of the extended planning
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the price is high, it is a fraction of what the developer
spent two years ago to push a 1,600-home development on the same
parcel that voters rejected in a special election.</TE>
<TE>   "The nursery spent $3 million to bludgeon the community into
accepting its plan, and that crashed and burned," Cole said. "The
$500,000 is cheap by comparison."</TE>
<TE>   The nursery's chief executive, Miles Rosedale, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried the more conventional method," Rosedale said, "but
this way we'll be sure that our plan is one that the citizens of
Azusa will be pleased with."</TE>
<TE>   The assurance is not ironclad, however. No matter how many
residents vote to approve the nursery plans, there is no guarantee
that some individual or faction won't decide later to fight the
development with a lawsuit or another city referendum.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending the community sessions, most recently in mid-April
at a senior center, seemed generally pleased with the progress. From
75% to 85% of the 200 residents present at the session agreed that
the design was staying on a course they prescribed at an earlier
meeting--including details such as creating an extensive network of
hiking trails and echoing historical architecture in home designs.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents said they were skeptical that their input would be
incorporated into the project, but they soon realized that their
fingerprints were all over the revised designs.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when residents protested a preliminary version of the
plan that had only three points of entry to the project, designers
added four more to spread the traffic so that no one neighborhood
would be impacted as heavily.</TE>
<TE>   And designers realigned the streets after residents protested a
major bulldozing of hillside terrain for the largest homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than being a developer-driven plan, I feel the city is
making a genuine attempt to listen to the community and
systematically address people's concerns," said resident activist
Marianne Miasnik. "When you're putting a brand-new community into a
100-year-old one, you have to be careful not to upset the balance."</TE>
<TE>   A map of the current development illustrates two neighborhoods:
the Promenade, which centers on a strolling retail area and includes
a 5.5-acre park and elementary school; and the Park, hillside homes
anchored by a ''village core'' of retail stores and a recreation
area.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller green splotches of pocket parks dot the streets of the
hillside development. The streets are aligned like haphazardly linked
sausages, rather than the rigid waffle grids that dominate much of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Although the design calls for only about 100 fewer units than the
plan voters shot down two years ago, designers said the difference
between the two plans is deeper than that number would imply.</TE>
<TE>   The houses will have more distinctive architecture to reduce the
mass-produced look of the region's other developments, said Steve
Kellenberg, a planner with the Irvine-based design firm EDAW.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike typical suburban tracts, which might provide 10 design
options for every 100 homes, the Azusa nursery plan envisions about
36 distinct designs of architectural and floor plans per 100 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Planners expect the project to generate about 4,400 new residents
in an anticipated 1,500 units, which include houses and apartments of
various sizes and prices.</TE>
<TE>   Those plans for diverse housing make some residents, even Mayor
Cristina Cruz Madrid, wary of approving the project too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Saying that anything other than single-family houses isn't needed,
she said, "We have more than our fair share of affordable housing for
the county."</TE>
<TE>   Cole knows that he will struggle to persuade residents of the need
for a variety of housing.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is not sure exactly how many apartment buildings
eventually will be built, he said the prices will be "much steeper"
than people are used to paying in Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a 45% jump in home prices over the last three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1998, homes seldom sold for more than $200,000, according to
a real estate database.</TE>
<TE>   But now prospective buyers have signed up to pay more than
$400,000 for homes in the city's newest tract.</TE>

<HD>Where Baseball Is Still a Game</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Former prep and minor-league stars try it again
in an L.A. hardball league.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To return to baseball Sunday, Mike Gutierrez bought cleats, a new
glove and stretch pants large enough to accommodate a waist that has
expanded since he pitched for San Fernando High in the late '80s. No
need for a new bat, though. Gutierrez, 30, brought his old "Black
Magic" to the Pacoima White Sox season opener.</LD>
<LD>   The aluminum Easton bat was a gift from his parents during his
days as a Little League slugger. Gutierrez's parents were rooting him
on once again Sunday. So was Mike's grandfather, and his grandmother,
who once bought a tiny Dodgers uniform at a rummage sale that Mike
insisted on sleeping in night after night.</LD>
<LD>   Running around the stands at the dusty ball field in Encino was
Gutierrez's 6-year-old son, Brandon. He is the reason the computer
analyst decided to suit up after nine years.</LD>
<TE>   "I figured if I started coming out, he'd get away from the
computer screen and the Game Boy and want to play," Gutierrez said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was opening day for the Los Angeles Department of
Recreation and Parks' adult baseball league. The city's softball
league has more than 500 teams, but for hardball, only 27.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the baseball players spent time on minor-league teams,
but most threw out their dreams of playing professionally along with
their baseball cards and pinstripe pajamas. They play for the
camaraderie. They like clicking around in cleats and saying
everything twice: "Hurry up, hurry up. Hustle, hustle. Get a helmet,
get a helmet."</TE>
<TE>   For these working men, amateur baseball is a way to have fun and
"forget about their problems at home," said umpire Encarnacion
Arellano, officiating city league games since 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacoima White Sox and their Sunday opponent, the Glendale
Reds, had dismal records last season. They made a few lineup changes,
brought in some guys in their early 20s and are hoping for the best.
Whatever happens during the 12-game season, they'll get a little
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Since a practice game last weekend, Gutierrez had been slathering
balm onto his sore muscles. His wife complained that its odor gave
her a headache.</TE>
<TE>   In his more limber days in high school, Gutierrez was fast enough
to be his team's leadoff batter. They could count on him to get a hit
and make it to first base.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I still get on base, but it just takes a lot longer to get
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Limping back to his team after scoring a run, Gutierrez said, "I'm
glad I type for a living."</TE>
<TE>   By the eighth inning Sunday, play had gotten sloppy with enough
errors to keep the wives laughing. Fly balls came dangerously close
to denting cars. The pitchers were walking one batter after another,
players were calling their buddies to check on the score of the
Lakers game and others were itching to get their families to Dodger
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Arellano called the game when it had reached its time limit
of 2 hours and 45 minutes. The White Sox won 18-8. Gutierrez scored
twice, launching his return to baseball with a perfect batting
average.</TE>
<TE>   Said George Reyes, his brother-in-law and the team coach, "How
'bout them White Sox?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The hills above Brea where Nuevo Energy Corp. wants to plant 914
houses hardly seem like a luxury destination. There is seeping tar,
leaking methane gas, an earthquake fault and soil tainted with
hazardous chemicals--not to mention hundreds of oil wells churning
around the clock, a gas plant, ubiquitous pipelines and two tank
farms processing crude.</LD>
<LD>   But convincing prospective buyers that the place can be cleaned up
for houses is not Nuevo's biggest hurdle. Oil companies have done
that many times before.</LD>
<LD>   No, the hard sell will be their neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   Nuevo and other oil giants are looking to build thousands of homes
on northern Orange County and southern Los Angeles County oil fields
that will eventually dry up. They're trying hard to assure nearby
residents that flattening and building on the hills won't drastically
alter their communities. Aera Energy LLCwants to build 3,600 homes,
mostly in L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Nuevo is girding for a particularly rough
battle. It had already angered preservationists by spending $205,000
against a November 2000 ballot measure that would have required Brea
voters' approval for most hillside developments.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on the eve of the failed referendum, the company withdrew
its development plan from the city. It later submitted its proposal
to the county instead.</TE>
<TE>   A company representative said Nuevo opted to file its development
plans with the county because it was the "more appropriate" agency,
given that the land is in an unincorporated area. Now Brea has no
power over what gets built on land that will ultimately be part of
the city, leaving some locals blaming the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe we hurt ourselves," said City Councilman Roy Moore.</TE>
<TE>   The city has tried to wield some influence by submitting its own
proposal for the property to the county. It included a couple of key
requests: that the project not disturb a ridgeline that locals are
particularly fond of, and that it not include a road that could
interfere with a vital wildlife link stretching from the Cleveland
National Forest to Whittier.</TE>
<TE>   Those suggestions were largely dismissed in the project's
environmental impact report, submitted late last month; it was
written by an independent consultant but reflects substantial input
from Nuevo.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of money to do this, and it appears to have fallen
on deaf ears," said Moore, who helped draft the Brea proposal. "We
may be getting development that is wrong for our community."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental report said the city's proposal would conflict
with oil and gas production, put homes too close to tar seeps and
require so much additional dirt to be moved that the cost for that
alone would sink the project.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo officials defend their own plan as a model of environmental
sensitivity. They say the ridgeline the city wants saved is actually
not a ridgeline but merely a hilltop with limited aesthetic value.
The controversial road the company hopes to build, they said, will be
specially designed to increase the mobility of animals through the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a conservation-minded plan," said Bob Odle, a real estate
consultant for Nuevo. "It provides for 65% of the land to remain as
open space."</TE>
<TE>   It's open space that doubles as an active oil field.</TE>
<TE>   Under its plan, the company will continue oil production on the
514 acres to be preserved as open space. There are 292 working oil
wells on that land, Odle said, and they will continue to pump for 30
to 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say that definition of open space is outlandish.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new one to me, calling active oil wells open space,"
said Claire Schlotterbeck, a founder of the Brea-based conservation
group Hills for Everyone. She says the project would be disastrous
for endangered gnatcatchers and other wildlife, despite company
assurances to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is this company's arrogance," she said. "They took an
end-run around the city to file their project with a county
government that has never seen a development proposal it doesn't
like."</TE>
<TE>   County officials say it is too early in the process to comment.
Hearings on the project will be held in mid-June. The environmental
report that was filed is only a starting point, they say, and they
need time to evaluate its merits.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Brea, meanwhile, remain conflicted about the lasting
effects of the hillside initiative of 2000. "These were
good-intentioned people who got people's minds focused on our
hillsides," Moore said of activists who drafted the ballot measure.
"But sometimes things go awry."</TE>

<HD>Hand-Burning Fine Is Just, Say Public Defenders</HD>
<DH>Courts: The attorneys support a judge for his reduced
charge against a man who punished his son, 5. The sentencing had
infuriated many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Orange County public defender's office have risen to
the defense of a judge who reduced charges against a father accused
of burning his 5-year-old son's hand over a gas flame.</LD>
<LD>   Several attorneys said Orange County Superior Court Judge James O.
Perez has been unfairly criticized for reducing the charges against
the father from a felony that could have brought six years in prison
to a misdemeanor resulting in no jail time and a $100 fine.</LD>
<LD>   The father, a Guatemalan immigrant, said he burned his son's hand
after discovering that the boy stole a pack of gum. The father said
his mother had disciplined him the same way during his childhood in
Guatemala.</LD>
<TE>   Over the stern objections of a prosecutor, Perez decided to reduce
the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. He argued that "customs
and habits" reflecting cultural differences played a role in his
decision, along with the fact that the father was making an earnest
effort to discipline his son.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was criticized for his decision by the prosecutor as well as
child abuse experts. But members of the public defender's office said
this week that Perez made the proper decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this is a case where the judge thought the father was
not sadistic but someone who disciplined a child in a way we all
thought was inappropriate," said Assistant Public Defender Denise
Gragg.</TE>
<TE>   The case has provided fodder for radio talk show hosts in recent
days, prompting public defenders to speak out in favor of the judge's
decision. Deputy Public Defender Jamalyn Ollinger said the important
issue is that the father is remorseful and cooperating with social
workers, who suggested that he attend parenting classes. He will also
receive counseling as part of probation, Ollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a social worker and probation officer that are monitoring
him.... It's not like he gets a $100 fine and he's gone," the
attorney said. "This will ensure he never harms another child. I
personally am certain he will never reoffend. He really does
understand his behavior was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Schatzle, the prosecutor in the case,
said that once the judge reduced the charge to a misdemeanor she
requested a probation sentence because she was certain he would not
impose jail time. "That case resolved exactly how the judge
intended," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Schatzle had argued against reducing the charge to a misdemeanor,
asking the judge, "At what point does a burning of a child's hand
become a felony?"</TE>
<TE>   Wellington Soto, 36, was arrested in January after he admitted to
Anaheim police that he burned his son's hand on a gas stove after he
caught him shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said he believed the father had good intentions, teaching
his child a lesson, but went about it the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   "We find ourselves in the crosscurrent of customs and habits," the
judge said during the April 23 sentencing hearing in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The decision outraged child abuse prevention advocates, who
contended that courts are often more lenient on violence committed
against family members than violence against strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "By the judge making that determination, he really sided with the
father and left this child even more of a victim," said Chris Monaco,
director of the Childhelp USA national child abuse hotline. "So, what
has this child learned? 'My dad can do this to me and get away with
it.'"</TE>

<HD>Controversy Brews Over 'Mexican St. Patrick's Day'</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Some hope to reverse the trend of associating
Cinco de Mayo with drinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Javier Rico, cocktail in hand, scoffed at the feathered Aztec dancers
who brushed by his barstool Sunday afternoon at a restaurant in
Universal CityWalk.</LD>
<LD>   ''What does that have to do with Cinco de Mayo?" the Pasadena
resident said. "This isn't authentic. In Mexico City, where I'm from,
it's not a big deal. Here, they make a big deal out of it."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, Cinco de Mayo was a big deal all over Southern California
and nationwide, where the Mexican holiday has caught on like, well,
margaritas.</LD>
<TE>   And that's just the problem, say an increasing number of Mexican
Americans, who worry that their fiesta's American translation gives
lip service to history amid gulps of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's become a commercial event that's totally devoid of
its political meaning," said Guillermo Hernandez, the director of
UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center. "It's just another excuse to
party. It's no different than going to Ensenada and having a beer. I
don't celebrate it in that way, because it doesn't mean anything to
me in that way."</TE>
<TE>   Julio Estrada knows how Cinco de Mayo is celebrated. He's from
Puebla, where outgunned Mexican troops beat the invading French on
May 5, 1862--burnishing the date on the Mexican calendar. "The most
important thing is the fireworks," he said of his hometown's
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   On this May 5, however, Estrada was washing cars at Studio City
Hand Car Wash, where Iranian owner Ben Forat was offering a free
scrub for every fifth car--just as he does for everyone who wears
green on St. Patrick's Day.</TE>
<TE>   There is no easy answer to why Cinco de Mayo appears headed the
way of St. Patrick's Day in the U.S., according to experts. It has
become the top "Mexican" holiday north of the border, usurping
Mexican Independence Day, Sept. 16, which is the prime patriotic
holiday in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   At heart, experts say, the holiday tugs at Mexican Americans'
nostalgia for an underdog victory amid centuries of conquest. The
battle of Puebla came just 15 years after Mexico lost a third of its
territory to the U.S., Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia may explain some of the popularity, but to San Fernando
Valley activist Albert Melena, alcohol explains the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of tragic that Cinco de Mayo is becoming another St.
Patrick's Day," said Melena, chairman of Los Angeles County's branch
of Latino Leadership United for Healthy Communities. "Look at the
ads. What's funny now is they are using Spanglish: 'drinko de Cinco.'
I'm not saying I'm a prohibitionist. If you want a drink, that's
fine. I'm just saying, don't co-opt our holiday."</TE>
<TE>   Like the Irish Americans wearying of the alliance of alcohol with
what once was a religious holiday, Melena wants Mexican Americans to
reconsider the fate of their fiesta before it's too late.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Problem in the Community</TE>
<TE>   The "drinko de Cinco" Melena talks about is this one: Health
experts say downing more than five drinks per sitting at least five
times a month makes you a problem drinker. A federal study in 1998
found that Mexican Americans topped every other ethnic group by that
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Melena's group is a minority within a minority so far. But it is
part of a nascent national movement, "Cinco de Mayo con Orgullo"
(Cinco de Mayo with Pride) that promoted alcohol-free celebrations
this year in Los Angeles, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area,
several Texas cities and Chicago. Since its founding in 1997, the
coalition has tried to rally crowds around the message that "This
culture is not for sale."</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been easy. When a San Diego group began organizing
Saturday's Cinco de Mayo festival in Barrio Logan, it was offered a
$10,000 sponsorship from a brewery, according to organizer Jovita
Hurtado. She declined to name the would-be benefactor, whose offer
was flatly rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'You're going to need the money; let us help,'"
Hurtado said. "They didn't think we could raise the money on our
own."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Southern California offered a mix of festivals, from
the sober to the slick. The alcohol-free fete on Olvera Street in
downtown Los Angeles was jammed with families, some of whom could
name the general who fought the Battle of Puebla (Ignacio Zaragoza),
and some of whom knew only that it fell on May 5.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Fabian, 26, who said she was half Mexican, said Cinco de
Mayo was Independence Day--until her Mexican-born husband, Francisco,
27, corrected her. "He wants the children to be proud of who they
are," she said, pointing to four youngsters, each of whom had a
Mexican flag painted on one cheek.</TE>
<TE>   At Whittier Narrows Park, Melena and a video-camera crew pointed
out the nearly empty Budweiser beer tents, the only area, he said,
where the county permitted alcohol consumption. Melena didn't take
that as a good sign.</TE>
<TE>   "The beer gardens are empty and people are out drinking among the
kids," he said. "It's kind of a free-for-all."</TE>
<TE>   Beer purveyors on both sides of the border say they are being
scapegoated for the American phenomenon of forgetting the purpose
behind most holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a day to celebrate the battles and the independence of our
country," said Jose Pares, director of communications for Grupo
Modelo in Mexico City, Mexico's largest brewer. "Sometimes that is
confused in the U.S.A. and people use it as a day of partying."</TE>
<TE>   Pares could not quantify how much May 5 weekend sales contribute
to the revenues of the $3.5-billion-a-year company. But its Corona
brand is the top-selling Mexican beer in the U.S. market, and its
other labels, Modelo Especial and Pacifico, sell briskly.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is nothing wrong with having a Mexican drink to
celebrate the day," Pares said. "It is the individual's choice to
drink, not ours."</TE>
<TE>   Like any other beer maker, Pares would like his company to be the
choice among those who "drinko for Cinco." This year, one Corona
radio spot features an appeal to make Cinco de Mayo an American
national holiday. Heineken, on the other hand, has played off Corona
by counseling imbibers to drink a beer that doesn't need a lime.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have Heineken advertising, you know there's money in
it," Melena said.</TE>
<TE>   The alcohol and beer industry sees no problem with another chance
to market its product.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Compared With St. Patrick's Day</TE>
<TE>   "Cinco de Mayo, like St. Patrick's Day, is a day associated with
going out with family and friends," said Beth Davies, spokeswoman for
the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. "We have actually
noticed responsible consumption of spirits during this holiday."</TE>
<TE>   Melena, who works on substance-abuse issues, however, says studies
of data from Los Angeles County show Latino males with higher rates
of DUI arrests and cirrhosis of the liver than other population
groups. One Los Angeles hospital study showed cirrhosis mortality
rates were twice as high for Latino men as for non-Latino whites.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol is a factor in the top four means of death for Latinos:
suicide, homicide, unintentional injuries and car accidents," Melena
said.</TE>
<TE>   While the cause of those trends may be as multiple as for any
social ill, Melena thinks the mainstreaming of Cinco de Mayo doesn't
help. Cultural pride, he noted, used to be a good defense against
substance abuse. Now, he said, the media are saturated with the mixed
message that drinking is part of Mexican cultural pride.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to try to remember the true meaning, because every year
that goes by, it gets worse and worse," Melena said.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Budget Phases Out Jail Doctors</HD>
<DH>Finance: Proposed cut could endanger inmates' health, LAPD
officials, other critics warn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's budget proposes phasing doctors out
of the city's three main jails and instead relying on nurses to cut
spending, a move that proponents say is needed to balance the budget
but that LAPD officials and others warn could endanger the health of
inmates and end up costing the city more money than it saves.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, 12 physicians and 24 nurses provide round-the-clock
care to an average of 370 arrestees in the city's large jails, which
house inmates while they are awaiting transfer to county lockups. The
proposal, backed by the city's Personnel Department, would phase out
the physicians through attrition. This year's budget cuts one
position at a savings of $138,816.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal calls for prisoners to be served by 28 nurses and
four part-time doctors, who would make rounds and be on call for
telephone consultation. Fully implementing the proposal would take
years and eventually save the city $1.4 million annually, said Tom
Coultas, assistant general manager of the Personnel Department.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook, a Hahn spokesman, said prisoners
who need greater medical care than the nurses can provide would be
taken to a hospital--something that already happens now with doctors
in the jails.</TE>
<TE>   "They would receive the same level of care they currently have,"
he said. "It's more cost-efficient to have nurses on duty."</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles Police Department officials and other critics
of the proposal say taking doctors out of the jails could expose the
city to lawsuits and take police officers off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Any savings accrued by phasing out 24-hour physician staffing at
the three Jail Division infirmaries could be wiped out by a single
lawsuit resulting from inadequate care," outgoing Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks wrote in a letter to the City Council's Budget
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   One union leader echoed Parks' concern. "All this is going to do
is cause delays, perhaps failure to treat arrestees in need of care,
and greatly increase the liability of the city of Los Angeles," said
Cheryl Parisi, executive director of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees Council 36, which represents
the jail doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Mark Burton acknowledged that a prisoner
could sue the city under state and federal law for failing to provide
appropriate medical care.</TE>
<TE>   "Potentially, there's significant liability," he said. "There is a
duty to provide adequate medical care [while] they're in our custody
and control."</TE>
<TE>   Burton said, however, that the city has been sued on the grounds
of jail physicians providing poor medical care.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the city paid a $40,000 settlement to a prisoner who said
his Van Nuys jail physician failed to give him proper medication. An
active case alleges that a prisoner taken to Van Nuys jail suffered
brain damage as the result of inadequate medical care, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said in his letter that nurses refer about 80% of arrestees
brought to the jails to the physicians on duty. He said he worries
that many of those prisoners would have to be taken to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Each time a prisoner needs treatment that nurses can't provide,
two officers would have to ferry him to the hospital, stay with him
for hours there, and then return him to jail, said Peter DiCarlo,
civilian commanding officer of the LAPD's jail division. "That pulls
more officers out of street patrol."</TE>
<TE>   Parks wrote that each hospital visit would cost $186 in salary,
plus more than $1,000 in transfer, maintenance and other hospital
costs.</TE>
<TE>   The Personnel Department's Coultas conceded that there are matters
that need to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We have serious issues to address with the Police Department in
terms of making this proposal work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ellen Goudlock has worked at the jails in Van Nuys and Parker
Center since 1987. Some days she sees 60 arrestees, other days she
sees none.</TE>
<TE>   She said the idea of having nurses phone on-call doctors for
advice won't work, because physicians are precluded by their licenses
from giving medical orders for a patient they have not seen.</TE>
<TE>   And registered nurses are not trained to provide the care that she
offers, Goudlock said</TE>
<TE>   "The nurses went to school for nursing. They did not go to school
to practice medicine," she said. "The nurses do things at the order
given by the doctors. They cannot do things on their own."</TE>

<HD>Opening in Sight for School Vision Clinic</HD>
<DH>Education: Students at Cesar Chavez elementary in Oxnard
will get free eye exams starting May 22. Program is funded by a tax
on tobacco.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of bureaucratic delays, the Oxnard Elementary School
District is set to unveil a no-cost clinic aimed at catching and
correcting vision problems before they can frustrate school
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Starting May 22, the eye clinic will be held once a week at Cesar
Chavez School in Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood. If successful, the
clinic could be replicated at schools across Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   It will be open to kindergarten and preschool students in the
Oxnard district, funded with money generated by a 1998 statewide
initiative that levies a cigarette tax of 50 cents per pack for child
development programs.</LD>
<TE>   The clinic had been scheduled to open earlier this year, but the
launch was postponed by a series of bureaucratic steps needed to free
the tobacco tax money.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with summer vacation fast approaching, school officials say
there is an urgent need to get the program up and running before this
year's crop of kindergartners moves on to the first grade.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting for the money to come down and in the process
missing a lot of children," said Linda Butcher, the district's
coordinator for health and nursing services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are teaching children to read earlier and earlier," Butcher
said. "And as we push that developmental envelope, we want to make
sure we've done all we can to make sure children are truly ready to
read."</TE>
<TE>   The project received a $105,000 grant last year from the group
charged with distributing money within the Oxnard school district
that is generated by Proposition 10, the tobacco tax initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The money will support the clinic for three years, during which
time a trio of optometrists plan to provide comprehensive eye exams
to hundreds of youngsters for a range of vision problems that could
affect their performance in school.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters with vision problems are often unaware the troubles
exist, even as they struggle to keep pace with peers, school
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   And those problems can generate reluctance on the part of students
to do the simplest of tasks, such as tracking words across a page.</TE>
<TE>   The vision clinic will test students for everything from depth
perception to color discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Clinic staff will help students, parents and teachers learn how to
correct or compensate for vision problems. And a referral network
will be in place for youngsters who need follow-up care, such as that
provided by the Lions Club, a service organization dedicated to
better vision for the disadvantaged that sponsors programs to provide
free and low-cost glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Kindergarten and preschool students in the Oxnard district
currently undergo a vision screening, but it's nothing like what will
take place at Cesar Chavez, said 82-year-old Oxnard optometrist
Albert Forbes, who is helping to launch the program as part of his
mission to establish free eye clinics for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the first year to check at least 500 kids," said Forbes,
who will staff the clinic with fellow optometrists Thomas L. Wolf and
Adolfo Murillo. "And if we get more financing, then we will try to
expand it."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $12 million a year flows to the county in Proposition 10
tax revenues. Of the total, $1.6 million a year is funneled to the
Oxnard Neighborhoods for Learning Collaborative, a collection of
school, community and faith-based agencies responsible for
distributing the money within the Oxnard Elementary School District
boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   School district Supt. Richard Duarte, who helps decide how the
money is handed out, said the group has doled out about $700,000 for
everything from immunization clinics to parenting programs.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes said it was particularly important to him to create the
vision clinic in the low-income La Colonia neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Children of all economic levels suffer from eye problems that can
hinder school performance, he said. But parents who are better off
financially often have the resources to catch those problems early
and get help.</TE>
<TE>   "This helps even the playing field," said Forbes, an eye doctor
for more than half a century who has long studied the link between
good vision and learning. "It doesn't mean we'll solve the entire
problem, but hopefully we'll be a spark in the dark."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Sign Caught in Secession Tug of War</HD>
<DH>Identity: If cityhood plan goes to a vote, landmark
ownership will be an issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It started life as a real estate ad and became a world-famous
landmark.</LD>
<LD>   It has fallen down and been fixed up. It has been scrawled with
hearts that say so-and-so loves so-and-so forever.</LD>
<LD>   Pranksters have draped it in sheets to read HOLLYWEED (for dope),
HOLYWOOD (for the pope), RAFFEYSOD (for the Raffeys, an obscure rock
band).</LD>
<TE>   Now, the Hollywood sign has been transformed again--into a symbol
used by both sides of the city's secession debate.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say the sign is the quintessential emblem of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a monument to this great city and to the entertainment
industry," said City Councilman Tom LaBonge, whose district includes
the sign and who is leading the city's charge to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want Hollywood to break away from Los Angeles say the
sign is really an emblem of the city's neglect and the ultimate
argument for secession. They insist that the sign belong to a city of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you seen what the sign looked like 20 years ago? It was a
disgrace. It broke your heart to look up there and to know that your
city didn't care enough to do anything," said nightclub owner Gene
LaPietra, leader of the Hollywood secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The nine giant letters perched on Mt. Lee now sit on city
property, within the more than 4,000-acre Griffith Park. Built in
1923 for $21,000, the sign read HOLLYWOODLAND and was owned by the
developer of a new subdivision in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   Jury-rigged out of canvas, plywood and telephone poles, it still
caught your eye--and no wonder. It blazed with 4,000 lightbulbs.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the neighborhood filled up. There was no more call for the
caretaker, who once lived in a shack beside the sign, to clamber up
ladders to change bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   The lights eventually went out.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1940s, the developer dumped a 455-acre property,
including the sign, on the city to get out from under a mountain of
back taxes. The city wanted the property to expand Griffith Park. As
for the sign, it let it quietly crumble.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1940s, the sign had lost its H and was tilting
precariously. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce stepped in, restored
the missing letter and took off the last four letters.</TE>
<TE>   "The city didn't really want to take care of it. The sign started
falling down the hill. It became sort of an embarrassment," said
Leron Gubler, president of the chamber, which hasn't taken a stand on
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The sign has always had to depend on the kindness of private
groups and citizens, said Gubler. The chamber has trademarked the
sign's image, and gives some of the proceeds to the nonprofit
Hollywood Sign Trust, which maintains the sign.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the 1970s, when the city didn't make repairs, the chamber
stepped in to make quick fixes, Gubler said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was one of those things you do with baling wire. By the
mid-1970s, it was in terrible disrepair. The first O's top third was
missing. The last O was completely missing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shards of the original sign littered the hillside. Bits and pieces
had been tumbling down for years.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Cooper began raising money for the sign in 1978. He lived in
the Hollywood Hills and played on a softball team called the
Hollywood Vampires. The shabby sign looked like the neighborhood, he
said in an interview from his home in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought that's the way it looked, that's the way it
probably should look--dilapidated and run-down, like Hollywood, like
Gloria Swanson," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But when the chamber asked him to sign T-shirts to raise cash for
the sign, he found the idea typically Hollywood flaky. He suggested a
faster and more lucrative approach. For about $28,000, anyone could
claim a letter.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference at Carlos 'n Charlie's on Sunset Boulevard,
Cooper--wearing a shirt with his name in iron-on letters--ripped off
one of the Os , declared himself Alice "Coper" and said he was giving
his O to the sign, which was missing one.</TE>
<TE>   The chamber gave the Y to Hugh Hefner, who raised thousands for
the sign at a Playboy Mansion bash. Gene Autry bought the second L.
Andy Williams bought the W.</TE>
<TE>   The flimsy sign was replaced with a much sturdier one--complete
with 194 tons of concrete, sheet metal and steel beams sunk into the
earth. The letters are five stories high. The whole thing weighs
480,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   In the secession battle, no one has suggested moving the sign an
inch. No one contemplates adding or subtracting letters. The fight is
over nothing more than bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission will decide next month
whether to place Hollywood secession on the November ballot. Which
city would get the sign will be part of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Hefner calls the sign "the closest thing that Los Angeles has--and
Hollywood has--to the Eiffel Tower." Like Cooper, he has no opinion
on secession, but believes the sign should go to the city that would
care for it best.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a sin what was going on there--or wasn't going on there
[before the 1978 renovation]. The city hasn't cared a great deal
about the sign. That's why we had to establish an independent fund to
rebuild the sign," he said. "If the city really cared about it, I
think they would not only keep it in top shape, but also light it....
I want the sign to wind up in the hands of a custodian that's really
going to take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   In the streets of the Hollywood Hills, the city posts yellow signs
declaring NO ACCESS TO THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN to discourage tourists from
blocking traffic or taking steep, illegal treks to get close. An
elaborate alarm system booms out warnings to intrepid hikers.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, Starline Tours trolley driver John Flechas takes
visitors up Beachwood Drive, where they pose with the sign as a
backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "People have seen it in movies. They've seen it so often," said
the retired city bus driver. "Last year, a gentleman came here from
the Netherlands who was so awestruck about just being near the sign,
he had tears coming down his cheeks."</TE>
<TE>   LaPietra said an independent Hollywood would welcome the sign's
fans, even those from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not proposing to put up the Berlin Wall or anything," he
said. "The rest of the city can feel free to look up at our sign
anytime they want."</TE>

<HD>Octane the Key to Engine 'Knocking'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: What is octane?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Octane is a measure of how much compression gasoline can
be subjected to before it spontaneously ignites. When gasoline
ignites in the cylinder before it is ignited by the spark plug, it
produces "knocking," which can damage the engine. The higher the
compression ratio of the engine, the higher the octane required.</LD>
<LD>   When petroleum is refined into gasoline, it yields hydrocarbon
molecules of various lengths, especially molecules with either seven
or eight carbon atoms--called heptane and octane, respectively.
Heptane ignites easily when compressed, but octane does not. A
mixture of 87% octane and 13% heptane is said to have an octane of
87. The 87-octane gasoline you buy at the pump will have a different
mixture of components, but will perform the same as that
octane/heptane blend.</LD>
<TE>   Octane can be increased easily by adding small quantities of
tetraethyl lead, but the lead clogs catalytic converters and is a
severe pollutant. Piston-engine airplanes are still permitted to use
leaded gasoline.</TE>

<HD>Netanyahu Calls for Expulsion of Arafat</HD>
<DH>Mideast: In L.A. appearance, Israel's former leader builds
support for Jewish state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew thunderous
applause Sunday when he told an audience of more than 2,000 Jewish
donors that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat should be
expelled from the Holy Land.</LD>
<LD>   "He should be thrown out," said Netanyahu, who spoke at the
Century Plaza Hotel as part of a multinational tour to drum up
support for the Jewish state. "That is what we should do."</LD>
<LD>   Netanyahu's words were a welcome call to action for many in the
audience, who said the media and the U.S. government have been overly
sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. They say President Bush should
be more supportive of Israel, the only democratically elected
government in the region.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to let Israel do what it needs to do," said Eric Klein,
42, a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles. "We can't well fight terrorism
in one part of the world and ignore terrorism in another part."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu spoke as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made his
way to Washington for meetings this week with Bush about the Mideast
peace process. Bush supports an Arab initiative to recognize Israel
in exchange for territorial concessions and the creation of a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials have opposed the idea of exiling
Arafat, arguing that regardless of his record, Israel will be unable
to make peace with the Palestinians without dealing with him. Sharon
has personally favored the idea of exiling Arafat, but has held off
at U.S. urging--one of several actions that have opened him to
criticism from political figures on the right, most notably
Netanyahu.</TE>
<TE>   The speech, sponsored by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los
Angeles, was the public kickoff of a $10-million fund-raising drive
to aid victims of terror in Israel. The federation said it will use
the funds to upgrade medical facilities, provide security at schools
and synagogues, counsel terror victims and enhance mobile clinics.</TE>
<TE>   The event also served as a somber remembrance of Jewish victims of
suicide bombs. Photographs of the victims were projected onto the
walls of the hotel's grand ballroom, and each table had a fact sheet
with personal information about those victims.</TE>
<TE>   Among the speakers was Alan Hayman, whose daughter died in a
suicide bombing at a Jerusalem pizzeria in August.</TE>
<TE>   "There can be no doubt about where responsibility for the violence
in the region lies," said Hayman, a retired engineer.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Shoshana Greenbaum, grew up in an Orthodox community
in Los Angeles and had taught at Emek Hebrew Academy in Sherman Oaks.
A student at Yeshiva University, she had been completing a study trip
to Israel and was five months pregnant with her first child.</TE>
<TE>   Audience members paid at least $50 to hear Netanyahu speak, and
they were solicited for additional contributions. The former prime
minister also spoke at a dinner Saturday night, which raised nearly
$2million. And earlier Sunday, he privately briefed the federation's
largest donors, who give more than $25,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very gratifying, but these are very tough times," said
Herbert Gelfand, chairman of the federation's Jews in Crisis
campaign, which began last month.</TE>
<TE>   Citing an increase in anti-Semitism throughout Europe and rewards
given by Iraq to the families of suicide bombers, Gelfand said Jews
see the current Mideast crisis as a "call to arms."</TE>
<TE>   "The Jews of the world will never forget the Holocaust," Gelfand
said, adding that many Jews failed to act as Nazis slaughtered their
brethren. "This is going to be different."</TE>
<TE>   In April alone, Jews nationwide raised $100 million for Israel,
according to H. Glenn Rosenkrantz, director of media affairs for
United Jewish Communities. The organization has taken in $5 million
daily for its Israel Emergency Campaign since April 8.</TE>
<TE>   Many synagogues are participating in the Jews in Crisis campaign.
Rabbi David Wolpe of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles said his
congregation raised more than $1.5 million in humanitarian aid last
month. Members of the synagogue will soon travel to Israel to visit
victims of terror in the hospital and get a firsthand look at the
physical damage and economic fallout from the Mideast crisis.</TE>
<TE>   At Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, Wolpe said, bomb victims
require costly injections because nails in some suicide bombs are
tipped with rat poison. "We can make sure they are never in short
supply" of treatment, Wolpe said.</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu said it is wrongheaded for the Bush administration to
continue dealing with Arafat on the theory that he is the
democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Adolf Hitler, he noted, was also democratically elected by the
people of Germany before World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't deal with these people," he said. "We throw them out."</TE>
<TE>   Netanyahu has taken his message about Arafat to the Capitol in
Washington and to numerous television programs. Last week, he
criticized Sharon's decision to allow Arafat to leave his compound in
Ramallah after a month in confinement.</TE>

<HD>Study of Use of Land Urged</HD>
<DH>Property: Supervisors are advised to analyze costs before
developing 11 acres near Camarillo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County government chief Johnny Johnston says supervisors
should put off any decisions about what to build on county-owned
property near Camarillo until an analysis of the site is complete.</LD>
<LD>   County staff members need more time to determine how much it would
cost to bring water and sewer lines to the site, and whether the
county should set aside a portion of the property for future office
space. An initial estimate shows the county could save as much as 60%
on rental costs if it builds its own office buildings.</LD>
<LD>   "First things first," said Johnston, the county's executive
officer. "You have to assess what you've got in terms of development
potential before you start making real commitments."</LD>
<TE>   Rival proposals on how the property should be used have been
debated since 1998, when the state deeded the 58 acres to the county.</TE>
<TE>   The property on Lewis Road south of Camarillo is already home to
54 mentally ill residents in two apartment buildings. The county's
RAIN homeless shelter and Casa Pacifica, a shelter for abused and
neglected children, is also there.</TE>
<TE>   Debate is centered on what to do with 11 acres of land still up
for grabs.Advocates for the mentally ill contend the property was
intended to compensate for the closure of Camarillo State Hospital
and should be used to build additional housing for the mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   "When the hospital closed, we were promised that services and
housing would be provided in the community," said Carol Luppino,
whose son is schizophrenic.</TE>
<TE>   Several other proposals have been offered. One suggested building
apartments for foster care youths transitioning out of the system.
Another called for a center to provide shelter and services for
homeless veterans.</TE>
<TE>   County Behavioral Health Department officials last year pitched
building a complex of apartments and townhomes for more than 200
mentally ill people. So far, however, supervisors have given
tentative approval only to 51 beds for the mentally ill and expansion
of the nearby homeless shelter.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston recommends that his staff conduct detailed studies on
water and sewer issues before any decisions are made about future
development. There is no potable water on the undeveloped property
and there are restrictions on how much will be available in the
future, Johnston said in the report.</TE>
<TE>   Drainage problems and zoning changes also need to be addressed, he
said. County officials have estimated the cost of installing
infrastructure at $8.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said a complete analysis will take at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long said Johnston's report is "right on target."</TE>
<TE>   "Right after we got the property from the state, we started making
proposals on what should go on it," Long said. "We jumped ahead of
the process."This gives us the chance to do the due diligence that is
needed. We need to move very cautiously in deciding what will go
there."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo, who pushed a plan that would allow a
developer to operate a social services hub for veterans and others,
said he is willing to give staff members more time.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in government moves very fast," Schillo said. "And this
is a big project, so we should make sure we cross all the ts and dot
all the i's."</TE>

<DH>Education: Measure to ban team names deemed offensive could
affect hundreds of schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To John O'Brien, principal of Torrance High, his school has "a
harmless nickname": the Tartars.</LD>
<LD>   The name, chosen almost 80 years ago, mostly for its alliteration
quotient, refers to the Turkic and Mongolian peoples who invaded
Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages. The fact that Tartars are a people
long gone, O'Brien said, is an added bonus. "It doesn't create big
issues."</LD>
<LD>   At least, not yet.</LD>
<TE>   If Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg has her way, there might be no
Tartars--or, for that matter, Vikings, Romans or Moors--left in
California.</TE>
<TE>   A bill sponsored by Goldberg--prompted by a long-standing debate
about team names and mascots associated with Native Americans--would
allow the State Board of Education or the California Postsecondary
Education Commission to ban any public school team name, mascot or
nickname they deem derogatory or discriminatory against a race,
ethnicity, nationality or tribal group.</TE>
<TE>   And though it may be unlikely that the board would toss out the
Tartars, news of the bill last week took many a Norman and Saxon by
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Geez," said Robert Hinojosa, principal of Huntington Park High
School, about the possibility that his Normans might have to go the
way of, well, the Normans. "I'm an ethnic minority, and I would not
want to slur or slander people. But at some point, where do we draw
our lines?"</TE>
<TE>   Michael Leininger, principal of La Canada High School, said the
only problem he's ever heard concerning the school's team name is
that some people don't know what a Spartan is.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a warrior," he said. "But it was also ... just like
Californians: people who lived in a certain state in ancient times."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Sparta, the Greek city-state renowned for its militaristic
might, reached the height of its power in the 6th century BC and
disappeared a few hundred years later.</TE>
<TE>   Today, examples abound of cultures that vanished long ago, only to
be resurrected in the 20th century as logos on school stationery and
football helmets. At the high school level alone, there are the
Alhambra Moors, the Beverly Hills Normans, the Loara Saxons in
Anaheim--and too many Spartans and Vikings to count.</TE>
<TE>   But if Goldberg, a Los Angeles Democrat, had her choice in the
matter, there would be no human mascots whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   "My own personal view is that there are too many animals, symbols
and colors that won't offend anybody," she said. "I would always err
on the side of caution."</TE>
<TE>   Under the provisions of the bill, anyone finding the mascot of a
California public school offensive may complain to one of two state
boards. Those boards may add the name to a list of banned mascots or
let it be if, for example, they decide that a Gaucho is not offensive
and its portrayal not demeaning.</TE>
<TE>   The boards, Goldberg said, "are sensitive to a multicultural and
multiethnic society. If they felt [a team name] rose to the level of
degradation, I would imagine they would add them to the list."</TE>
<TE>   Schools with team names that allude to Native Americans have long
struggled to balance school tradition with cultural sensitivity. Many
principals say they have watched colleagues debate the merits of
names such as Braves and Redskins, retool cartoonish or fierce logos
and sometimes rename their teams altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Those principals felt a small measure of relief that their own
team names escaped dispute. But yet, there are hundreds of elementary
schools, high schools and colleges that may soon confront the kind of
controversy more associated with the Sioux than the Scots.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Principal O'Brien said the names of ancient cultures used
to be a "safe bet. In our district, we have the South High Spartans
and the North High Saxons. Nowadays, no matter what name you pick,
it's very challenging."</TE>
<TE>   The worst slur against the Tartars, he observed, is not even a
racial one. Fish jokes are common as opponents threaten to "make
Tartar sauce."</TE>
<TE>   Though many team names are chosen for obvious reasons--consider
the Sultana Sultans or the John F. Kennedy High School Fighting
Irish--often, the historical or geographical reasons for team names
have become obscured by the passage of time and shifting Southland
demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Coachella Valley High School picked the Arabs because the area is
rich with date trees imported from the Middle East. The Hollywood
High School Sheiks were named in homage to the 1921 Rudolph Valentino
movie. And Rim of the World High School in Lake Arrowhead chose the
"Fighting Scots" because the school, on the edge of Highway 18, feels
as if it's perched in the Scottish Highlands.</TE>
<TE>   "Highlanders seemed a natural thing to be," said Principal Walt
Harris, who has worked at the school for many years. "But there were
already several Highlanders as mascots. So they went to the Fighting
Scots. The Fighting Scots were tribesmen, they were brave.... I
frankly look at people who object to that, and I think they are
missing the point."</TE>
<TE>   Names chosen because of the warrior-like images they conjure
up--the Moors, after all, invaded Spain in the 8th century--are
criticized for the warrior-like images they conjure up.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Sonoma State University replaced its team name,
the Cossacks, with the less militaristic Seawolves after students and
community leaders complained that the first name honored a Russian
ethnic group famed for mercenary work on behalf of the czars."The
Cossacks no longer serve as a unifying symbol," Sonoma State
President Ruben Arminana said in a press release at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Shehadeh, West Coast regional director of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, agrees that mascots can reinforce
negative stereotypes. "When you dehumanize people as images or
characters, it becomes OK to hurt them."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg echoed that concern. "If you want to honor a people, find
a famous Scotsman and name the school after him. Or pick an important
leader in the Cherokee or Apache nation. Making [a tribe] a mascot is
not an honor."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's bill, AB 2115, has passed the Assembly Education and
Higher Education committees, but it must still clear the Assembly and
Senate before reaching the desk of Gov. Gray Davis, who has taken no
position on the measure. Opposition to the bill so far has been
meager, in part because of the power, or perceived power, of North
American tribes and Native American activists backing it.</TE>
<TE>   And although turning Saxons into Sharks might be seen as a
pragmatic move in some circles, even the most innocuous names can
have unexpected implications.</TE>
<TE>   The Sonoma Seawolves were intended to allude to Jack London's
classic novel. However, seawolf can have a militaristic meaning too,
as several letters to a local newspaper suggested. It was the
nickname for a Nazi U-Boat commander.</TE>

<HD>Hearing Set on Oracle Deal</HD>
<DH>Government: State lawmakers begin probe of controversial
$95-million software agreement, even as officials try to rescind it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- State lawmakers will delve into the details of
California's controversial computer contract with Oracle Corp. today,
hoping to learn more about a $95-million deal that gave the state
more software licenses than there are state employees and that is
turning into a major embarrassment for the Davis administration.</LD>
<LD>   State officials are already moving to undo the contract after a
scathing audit last month that concluded that there was little demand
for the software, and that the deal would actually cost California
taxpayers up to $41 million, a far cry from the $111 million in
savings promised by a state consultant.</LD>
<LD>   But lawmakers--particularly Republicans--want to know more, in
light of subsequent revelations of document shredding at the
technology department at the center of the probe, and an admission by
Gov. Gray Davis' e-government czar that he accepted a $25,000 check
for Davis' reelection from an Oracle lobbyist while the deal was
being negotiated.</LD>
<TE>   The tenor and scope of the hearings remain uncertain; Assembly
Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and Minority Leader Dave Cox
(R-Fair Oaks) are scheduled to discuss the issue today in hope of
reaching a bipartisan consensus.</TE>
<TE>   But already, the Oracle flap has put the Democratic governor on
the defensive and provided new fodder for his Republican opponent in
November, businessman Bill Simon Jr., who has continually accused
Davis of mixing fund-raising with the business of government.</TE>
<TE>   It has also placed Sacramento's Democrats in a precarious
position, requiring them to react forcefully or face Republican
criticism that they are protecting the governor. GOP lawmakers have
already asked the federal government to conduct its own Oracle
investigation, arguing that Democratic Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whom
Davis asked to investigate the matter, cannot be impartial because he
accepted $50,000 from the software maker in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has tried to distance himself from the Oracle deal, saying
last week that he knew nothing of it before it was consummated, was
moving swiftly to ferret out the bad actors, and that he was as "mad
as anyone" about it.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who spent the last few weeks deflecting criticism over his
refusal to publicize his tax returns, has in turn questioned Davis'
claims of ignorance and remarked that the "scent of scandal
surrounding the administration is growing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Audit Finds Little Scrutiny of Deal</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle deal--which has already led to the resignation or
suspension of three top Davis administration officials--took place
last year with little legal scrutiny and no competitive bidding,
according to the state audit released last month. Its roots go back
to 2000, when the Department of Information Technology, a new agency
created in response to the state's costly computer boondoggles of the
early 1990s, hired a consultant to explore better ways of buying
software.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon Inc. advised state officials that by agreeing to purchase
computer software en masse through long-term contracts, the state
could capitalize on economies of scale and supply thousands of state
employees at far lower rates than departments could individually
obtain. The so-called enterprise licensing agreements provide large
packages of software, technical support and maintenance at a bulk
rate, which can result in significant savings for large companies or
governments with many computer users. Logicon, a reseller of such
software, put together a draft "white paper" for the state on how to
enter into the arrangements, which the state had never done before,
without overpaying.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of 127 state entities found that only five were
potentially interested in banding together to purchase more Oracle
software. Nonetheless, officials approved a contract for 270,000
software licenses last May--more than the state's 234,000
employees--in part because of a Logicon projection that the state
would save as much as $111 million over time.</TE>
<TE>   The six-year contract was endorsed by Finance Director Tim Gage
and General Services Director Barry Keene before it was approved in
the governor's office by Davis Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy, on
May 31. A memorandum from the governor's office that same day stated
the deal had to be approved immediately because Oracle had to report
fiscal year profits as of May 31, "and was therefore motivated for a
limited time to offer the aggressive pricing," which "would save the
state an estimated $111 million, conservatively."</TE>
<TE>   The contract allows all state departments and employees to use
Oracle's database software, which can store, update and analyze
complex reams of raw information. It also allows state and local
government officials to purchase other Oracle products at a 50%
discount through 2006. And it includes complimentary maintenance and
technical support, which the state can opt to extend for four
additional years.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon's savings estimate was never independently verified by the
state, however, despite red flags thrown up by a unit of the Finance
Department, and the audit concluded that rather than saving money,
the deal would cost taxpayers as much as $41 million. A subsequent
state survey determined that several large agencies, including the
Justice Department, already had separate computer contracts with
Oracle, and many, if not most, state employees will never use the new
software.</TE>
<TE>   "Without knowing the true costs and benefits of the contract, the
state committed millions of taxpayer dollars to a questionable
technology purchase," state Auditor Elaine Howle concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, under a side deal with Oracle, Logicon stands to make
$28million from the contract, something state officials apparently
did not know before signing it, the audit concluded. As a result,
Lockyer charged Friday that the company may have violated state law
by "serving two masters" in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Logicon, which now goes by the name of its
parent Northrop Grumman, dispute that contention, saying some state
officials understood the company's role well.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Logicon consulting contract was not formally canceled
until November, well after the Oracle deal was made, company
representatives say the firm had stopped doing work for the state
much earlier. Logicon never completed its original duties and was
never paid for the work.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle representatives, meanwhile, defended the contract last week
as a good one for the state, even as they offered to rescind it. To
support their position, the firm hired former state Auditor Kurt
Sjoberg, who maintains that his successor's audit is wrong and that
the state would in fact save up to $110million over time as a result
of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Howle stands by her figures.</TE>
<TE>   "We are willing and able to rescind the offer from our
perspective," Oracle spokesman Jim Flinn said.</TE>
<TE>   "However, we continue to believe it is a good deal for the state,
but others are going to have to make a judgment about that."</TE>
<TE>   "If we sell that software on an annual basis or if we wrap it up
in an enterprise license agreement, we just want to do what makes
sense for our partner, the state of California," added Ken Glueck,
Oracle's vice president of government affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' reelection campaign reported receiving a $25,000 donation
from Oracle on June 5, days after the contract was finalized. But
Arun Baheti, the governor's director of e-government, told top Davis
aides that he accepted the $25,000 check from an Oracle lobbyist
before the negotiations were complete and mailed it to the campaign.
The check had a March date.</TE>
<TE>   Glueck, who is responsible for all political contributions made by
Oracle, said the company had agreed to give Davis the money as part
of an April technology event hosted by Davis that was attended by
roughly 30 companies. Delivery of the check was apparently delayed,
he said, and was unrelated to the state contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I simply had no knowledge that an enterprise license agreement
was pending in any form or shape whatsoever," Glueck said. "The fact
is that we're a major employer in the state, we're the largest
software company in the state, we have an interest in the political
process and we participate, and it's our right to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "With 20/20 hindsight, could the timing have been better?
Perhaps," he added. "In hindsight, I understand how this could be
interpreted."</TE>
<TE>   Baheti, a former Democratic Party official who worked on Davis'
1998 election campaign, was forced to resign last week. His
resignation followed that of Keene, the General Services director who
was faulted for signing off on the deal without more careful review.</TE>
<TE>   Elias Cortez, the embattled Information Technology director who is
widely seen as the biggest booster of the Oracle pact, has been
indefinitely suspended. And the Legislature is considering abolishing
his department over the very type of computer fiasco it was created
to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol rushed to department headquarters
last week amid reports of document shredding in Cortez's office, and
authorities confirmed some shredding had taken place, though a
spokesman for the department called it a routine disposal. Justice
Department officials, who had already seized trash and computer files
at the offices, plan to interview technology officials today about
the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   Not a single state employee has used the Oracle software to date,
largely because the state has not developed procedures to bill
departments for doing so. By the time it does in June, the audit
concluded, the state will have racked up $17 million in costs and
interest related to the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing is just astounding," said Sen. Debra Bowen
(D-Marina del Rey), a leading critic of the technology department.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen is pushing a bill to ensure technology purchases go through
the same conflict-of-interest checks as other state contracts. Davis
and former Gov. Pete Wilson previously vetoed similar bills by Sen.
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon).</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to believe more in the incompetence theory than the
conspiracy theory," Bowen said, "but at some point you've got to
wonder just how incompetent a state agency can be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point of Hearing May Soon Be Moot</TE>
<TE>   The hearing today by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee is
expected to attract hordes of reporters, but its ultimate purpose is
now in question.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), the head of the panel
composed of lawmakers from both houses, says his goal has always been
"to build a foundation for the unwinding of this contract." That,
however, is already underway.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and Logicon have both expressed a willingness to rescind
the deal in light of overwhelming negative publicity, and the Davis
administration is pressing to do so, which may soon make the actual
contract a moot point.</TE>
<TE>   Florez said he also wants to review the "mistakes that were made"
to avoid repeating them.</TE>
<TE>   Among the witnesses summoned to testify are Cortez--though Florez
indicated late last week that he may no longer appear--and Debbie
Leibrock, the finance official who raised objections to the deal.
Florez also wants Oracle and Logicon officials to testify at some
time in the future.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans want to carry the inquiry much further--to
assess possible criminality and ties to the governor's office. They
want to hear testimony from top Davis administration officials,
including Kennedy, the Cabinet secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he wants to see Garry South, the governor's campaign
manager, on the witness stand regarding the timing of the $25,000
contribution, an idea Florez quickly dismissed as ridiculous and
politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   "If they pursue this with the same vigor they pursued [former
Insurance Commissioner Chuck] Quackenbush, I think we could
compliment them and say they did good work," Sen. Ray Haynes
(R-Riverside) said of the Democrats. "If they don't, then we go
through a partisan drill that is nothing more than window dressing.
That's going to be the test."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President George Bush blew into the Golden State last week, visiting
South-Central Los Angeles 10 years after his father did on the heels
of the city's riots, and raising $4.5 million for Bill Simon.</LD>
<LD>   (East Coast news media name alert: The day after the primary, USA
Today called him "Paul Simon," and last week, the Washington Post
called him "Bob Simon." Here's a helpful mnemonic device: His father
was Treasury secretary, in charge of the agency that prints the
bills. Bills, get it?)</LD>
<LD>   Simon, who flew from Albuquerque to LAX with Bush aboard Air Force
One, descended the steps behind Bush's chief political strategist,
Karl Rove. The motorcade to First AME Church, scheduled for 25
minutes (that's what they always say in L.A.), took 35, and at one
point, on the Harbor Freeway near USC, the tail end of gridlock was
only a few car-lengths ahead of the First Limo.</LD>
<TE>   Sighted in deep conversation with Rove and Gerald Parsky, Bush's
No. 1 GOP guy in California: deeply Democratic L.A. Mayor Jim Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Sighted in deep crowds at the fund-raiser later that day: a cast
of Hollywood characters, among them law-and-order-role actors Chuck
Norris and Robert Stack, Roseanne Barr/Arnold/Thomas, Connie Stevens,
Lee Majors and Rick Schroder.</TE>

<TE>   China's Hu Dances to His Own Tune</TE>
<TE>   The title of "whip" is a noun, not a verb, but last week, San
Francisco's Nancy Pelosi, who holds that leadership job among
Democrats in the House of Representatives, took the opportunity to
try to deliver policy-lashing letters to China's vice president and
heir-apparent leader on his visit to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, for years a critic of Beijing's Communist regime, had
petitions from the Connecticut and New Jersey delegations asking for
the release of a U.S. citizen and a U.S. permanent resident, both
jailed in China and both ailing. She and Virginia Republican Rep.
Frank R. Wolf wrote a letter about political prisoners in Tibet, and
Pelosi penned her own missive about three political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with Hu Jintao, Pelosi brought up human rights and
laid the letters on a table. Hu, who reportedly loves to dance,
nimbly did a two-step: He and his entourage literally refused to
touch the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Pelosi declared herself to be "extremely disappointed
that the vice president refused to accept these letters. I had been
hopeful that we could at least talk about human rights issues in
China and Tibet, but Mr. Hu's refusal demonstrates how serious the
problem remains."</TE>

<TE>   Words of Wisdom From the Sage of Wyoming</TE>
<TE>   Alan Simpson, the former Wyoming GOP senator whose Veg-O-Matic
tongue took political hams and turned them into chopped liver, hasn't
lost the touch. At the bipartisan Orange County Forum in Irvine,
Simpson sliced and diced his way across the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   On 24-hour news: "Life isn't 24/7, so how distorted is that?
They're not in the news business, they're in the competition
business."</TE>
<TE>   On Republicans: "They give each other the saliva test of purity.
... You show me a one-hundred-percenter and I'll show you someone I
want to stay away from."</TE>
<TE>   On life: "If you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, then

<TE>   Deep Throat? They're Still Talking</TE>
<TE>   The identity of Deep Throat--the super-secret Watergate scandal
source christened with the name of a porn movie--has titillated
Beltway gossips for a quarter-century, and it's doing so again.</TE>
<TE>   A new book argues that Deep Throat is alive and thriving in
California.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI," investigative
reporter Ronald Kessler suggests that Deep Throat is an 80-something
ex-FBI man named Mark Felt, living in Santa Rosa with his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Felt's name has been in the Deep Throat mix before, as a
second-tier possible, because as a top-ranking G-man, he was miffed
at Richard Nixon after being passed over for the FBI chief's job.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's new evidence: Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward was
visiting Felt in California at a time when Woodward was working on a
Watergate book. Kessler writes that according to Felt's daughter,
Woodward's limo parked about 10 blocks from Felt's home, then the
writer/editor came in for a martini and an amiable chat.</TE>
<TE>   Felt has denied being D.T., and the visit doesn't prove otherwise,
Kessler said, "but it adds to the lore," and in D.C., they love the
lure of lore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking Legislation</TE>
<TE>   Before term limits, a lot of public servants' careers weren't
buried until they were, and the state used to pony up all of $600 for
their last rites.</TE>
<TE>   Now Assembly Bill 2688 would raise the burial benefit for
legislators and their spouses to $7,500. The author is Santa Clara
Democratic Assembly member Elaine Alquist. Her husband, former state
Sen. Alfred Alquist, is 94.</TE>

<TE>   The Fleeting Nature of Fame</TE>
<TE>   The grand reopening of L.A.'s strikingly remodeled City Hall,
illuminated by fireworks and enlivened by white-chocolate models of

that by now was supposed to be the last terrace of a gardened
greensward descending from the Music Center but which is still just
the parking lot for the Criminal Courts building.</TE>
<TE>   Inside that building, of course, is where the world-watched O.J.
Simpson double-murder trial was held, presided over by Judge Lance
Ito. Ito and his wife, Margaret York, the top-ranking woman at the
LAPD, were guests at the grand reopening, waiting in line to enter,
and in the transitory nature of fame, a young receptionist checking
names asked Ito, "And you are ... ?" (It's a good bet that no one
puts that question to the ex-defendant, now Florida's most famous
amateur golfer.)</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Responds to Complaints of Racial Profiling</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Panel of police officers and residents is
seeking ways to improve department's relationship with groups in the
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to complaints of racial profiling, a committee of Oxnard
police officers and residents is putting together a wish list for
improving law enforcement's relationship with the community.</LD>
<LD>   Suggestions by the Subcommittee on Racial Profiling range from
having a diversity expert lecture police to asking religious leaders
to speak to residents about their relationships with officers. The
panel is an offshoot of Police Chief Art Lopez's 3-year-old Community
Advisory Council.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez asked the eight-member subcommittee to design a cultural
diversity class that will be required for all department employees,
possibly as early as late summer.</LD>
<TE>   "We brought the issue before the community council as something we
need to work on collectively and come up with solutions," Lopez said
Thursday, a day after the group met at the main Oxnard Library.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee was formed in February after several residents
complained to state and federal officials that officers were singling
out possible suspects based solely on race or ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   While no claims of profiling have been substantiated against the
police force, a lawsuit is pending in federal court over the death of
Robert Jones, a 23-year-old black man killed by police last August.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who had complained of profiling by Oxnard police, was shot
to death inside his home after his mother called police to help get
her knife-wielding, distraught son to a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   A decision by the Ventura County district attorney on whether the
police shooting was justified is due by the end of the month, Lopez
said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief has denied that profiling occurs but said that he
strongly believes his officers need more training about what
constitutes racial profiling, as well as cultural diversity and
sensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there enough training?" Lopez asked. "There's probably never
enough."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of profiling complaints against police agencies across
the state, the Commission on Police Officer Standards recently
finished designing a four-hour racial training program.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's cultural diversity course would be offered in
conjunction with the state commission's profiling class. Both will be
mandatory for officers and run a total of eight hours.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, guest speaker Erylene Piper-Mandy said racism must
be addressed by both residents and police. She is a diversity expert
from Compton who is expected to help design the curriculum and teach
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have to keep talking to each other and looking at the
issue from both perspectives or we will continue to misinterpret each
other," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Piper-Mandy cited a study that asked several racial groups what
they most wanted from police. White respondents, she said, answered
"law and order" while blacks and Latinos said "fairness and respect."</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is an important message to share with officers, and
that is that many members of minority groups don't feel as if they
get what most of white America seems to get--and that is respect,"
said Sgt. Marty Meyer, a subcommittee member.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Cortez, a civilian telecommunications manager for the Navy,
said he agreed with Piper-Mandy's suggestions but also wants the
committee to find a way to educate residents and children on how to
get along with police.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever we can do is going to help because we need some damage
control and need it in a hurry," said Cortez, also a subcommittee
member.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the city has a clergy council that he hopes can help
the subcommittee draft ideas on how to teach and preach to the
community about forging better relationships with police officers.</TE>
<TE>   He is also considering talking about the issue with elementary and
junior high students who have been attending a series of symposiums
to discuss safety issues in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to reach out to educators, clergy--anybody that has a
podium to talk to people about this," said Manuel Munoz, publisher of
the bilingual weekly newspaper Vida, who attended the meeting.</TE>

<HD>Smuggling by Airline Guards Feared</HD>
<DH>Safety: Hired to oversee travelers without visas, some are
suspected of allowing illegal entry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL, RICH CONNELL and GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spurred by concerns about terrorism, federal authorities are
investigating whether private guards hired by major airlines at LAX
have smuggled international passengers from the Middle East and
elsewhere into the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators with the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service suspect security escorts may have helped systematically
spirit away travelers en route between foreign countries under the
little-known federal Transit Without Visa program, which permits
foreigners to stop briefly in the U.S. without visas.</LD>
<LD>   Federal authorities have expressed concerns for years about
weakness in the program.</LD>
<TE>   In the last three years, airlines have been cited by the INS for
nearly 6,000 violations nationally in which the carriers could not
document that program participants left the U.S. in a timely manner.
Federal officials could not say how many of those passengers remained
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Sporadic evidence of smuggling has cropped up before. Criminal
charges were filed in recent years in New York and Los Angeles
against security guards accused of helping transit passengers slip
out of airports, records show.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the Justice Department inspector general after the
Sept. 11 attacks warned of continuing gaps in the transit program and
concluded that the agency "must take immediate action ... to enhance
national security."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law enforcement sources say their inquiry at Los Angeles
International Airport has yet to turn up evidence that violent
extremists have gotten into the country via the transit program. "We
are not far enough into the investigation to know if it has been
exploited by terrorists," one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Agents, however, are aggressively tracking down hundreds of
clients--most of them Middle Eastern--of a phony-document ring that
may be linked to the suspected airport-smuggling scam. Investigators
suspect some of those who bought bogus Social Security cards from the
ring arrived at LAX as transit passengers and remained in the country
illegally. A former LAX transit guard from Jordan--who obtained an
INS stamp--is among those who pleaded guilty in the false-document
ring.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines vigorously defend the decades-old Transit Without Visa
program as both safe and economically vital. But leading INS
officials say the threat of terrorism demands a reexamination.</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent, this comes down to us taking a new and different
look at everything we do after Sept. 11," said Thomas J. Schiltgen,
INS district director in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The INS suspended much of the program immediately after last
September's attacks, and agency officials considered eliminating it.
However, the program was revived in November after some changes,
including a new requirement that all transit passengers undergo
immigration inspection, which includes a check against federal
databases that flag suspected criminals and potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The INS is expected to propose a broader overhaul soon. Among
other changes, the agency is considering a ban on multiple stops for
transit passengers and adding several Middle Eastern and African
countries to a list of more than 20 nations whose citizens are barred
from passing through U.S. airports without visas.</TE>
<TE>   The Transit Without Visa program is an important marketing tool
abroad for the highly competitive airline industry. In the three most
recent fiscal years, more than 5 million airline travelers--almost 5%
of all foreign nationals entering the United States via
airports--arrived as visaless transit passengers, destined for
connecting flights overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The program allows carriers to route many of their most lucrative
customers through LAX and other major hubs in the U.S., while
offering fliers a means to avoid the inconvenience of obtaining
visas, including time-consuming State Department background checks.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the United States, transit passengers typically remain in
the airport for several hours. More than 1 million a year are
directed to secured lounges. But those lounges are sometimes poorly
guarded, according to the post-Sept. 11 critique by the Justice
Department's inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   Some Without Visas</TE>
<TE>   Leave Airports</TE>
<TE>   An additional 200,000 passengers a year, escorted by private
guards, are allowed to mingle with the general airport population,
transfer to other terminals or even leave the airport. Some visit
restaurants, hospitals or consulates, or stay overnight in hotels
while waiting for their connecting flights.</TE>
<TE>   Air carriers, under contract with the INS, are responsible for
providing the escorts and ensuring that the travelers depart within
eight hours or on the next available flight. LAX is the nation's
leading port of entry for the escort program, with 56,000 travelers
served in fiscal 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Federal studies dating back almost a decade have warned that the
program is outdated and vulnerable to abuse. Moreover, according to
records and interviews, the INS cannot verify that all the foreign
travelers actually leave--largely because inspectors at airports do
not confirm each departure at the time of boarding, but rely on an
archaic paperwork system that takes weeks to enter into INS
computers.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials acknowledge gaps in the system. In one LAX case two
years ago, two employees of a security firm pleaded guilty to federal
charges for trying to smuggle in three Thai women who arrived as
transit passengers on a Korean Air flight from Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme, foiled by the employees' supervisor, involved swapping
the women--allegedly destined for employment at a massage
parlor--with three impostors who were to take their outbound seats.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say the current federal investigation of the program at
LAX involves a review of airport operations, a hunt for transit
passengers who may have slipped into the country in recent years and
an effort to identify corrupt airport workers who may have aided
them.</TE>
<TE>   Directing the investigation, officials said, is an anti-terrorism
task force--including representatives from the FBI, INS, Federal
Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration--that is
focusing on long-term national security issues such as immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The LAX investigation stems in part from the prosecution of the
phony-document ring, which generated nearly 1,000 fraudulent Social
Security numbers, mostly for Middle Easterners. The operation was
broken up in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, federal agents
stepped up efforts to find the cardholders, who have scattered across
the country and overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Among the three ring members who pleaded guilty in the case was
Firas Rteimeh, a 32-year-old Jordanian who worked as a transit escort
at LAX from 1996 until shortly before his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh was employed by Aviation Safeguards, the largest of about
half a dozen providers of transit passenger security services at LAX.
The company, under contract with various airlines, escorts 50 to 60
transit passengers a day at LAX, according to interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh, who recently completed his 18-month sentence and is free
pending an appeal that could affect INS efforts to deport him, helped
line up customers for the fake Social Security cards, court records
show. Agents found more than $100,000 in cash and the INS stamp
during a search of his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Rteimeh and his attorney did not respond to interview requests. In
a brief conversation in March, Rteimeh said he was not aware of a
continuing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Safeguards has not been advised of a federal probe of the
transit program, said Sunny Williams, the company's Los Angeles
general manager. "If they are investigating our employees, I don't
know," Williams said in an interview. "[But] we handle quite a few of
these types of escorts, [so] I wouldn't be surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Workers Disciplined if</TE>
<TE>   Departures Not Proved</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Safeguards, a division of Command Security Corp. of New
York, is a major nationwide airport security provider. Two years ago,
a branch of the company in Florida was placed on two years' probation
and ordered to pay more than $100,000 in fines and restitution after
a former general manager allowed more than 20 employees to work in
secure airport areas without required background checks.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, Williams said, Aviation Safeguards assisted with the
Social Security fraud investigation, adding, "We will cooperate in
the fullest" with the current inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The executive said he had no suspicions about Rteimeh but he
acknowledged he has had to discipline or terminate workers in recent
years because airlines could not document that escorted passengers
actually departed.</TE>
<TE>   "Has it happened to our company? Yes," Williams said.
"Occasionally, we've had people who are bad apples and we got rid of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Any [transit security company] who says the contrary is lying."</TE>
<TE>   Several federal officials say Rteimeh was investigated more than
two years ago, while still working as a guard, by the INS on
suspicion of smuggling in fellow Jordanians via the transit program.
He was never charged in that case.</TE>
<TE>   The Transit Without Visa program was launched after World War II
to help resettle refugees, many of whom lacked identity and travel
documents.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials have argued that the program is obsolete and
represents too great a security risk. But drawn-out legal and policy
battles between the INS and the airline industry have delayed some
efforts to bolster controls.</TE>
<TE>   Airline representatives, struggling to recover from the travel
slump after Sept. 11, say they will lose millions of dollars in
revenue and about 40% of international passengers transiting through
U.S. airports if visas are required for all such travelers. Likely to
be especially hard hit, industry officials say, would be giant U.S.
carriers such as American and Continental, with extensive routings
between the U.S. and Asia, Europe and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in the INS who feel that the Transit Without
Visa program has been nothing but an open invitation for people to
enter the United States illegally," said Robert Davidson, assistant
director of facilitation services for the International Air Transport
Assn. "The numbers, I don't believe, support that. But, for some, if
you lose one person, that's too many."</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general's report issued in December found that
security concerns identified nine years ago in the transit passenger
program "for the most part ... still exist today."</TE>
<TE>   Although it does not identify airports or airlines, the report
found that security standards for transit passengers vary nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In some airports, INS managers reported, transit passengers have
been allowed to move unaccompanied. Passenger-to-guard ratios vary,
with as many as 20 travelers per escort. In addition, INS managers
told federal investigators, some airlines are willing to absorb a
$500 fee for each passenger they cannot prove exited the country on

than beefing up security.</TE>
<TE>   "The onus is on the airlines, and that makes it in some cases
problematic," said Peter Gordon, the INS' assistant regional director
for inspections in the Western states. "But it's a very important
privilege for these airlines. It's an important source of profit. So
they guard it jealously."</TE>

<HD>Railroad Tunnel Is a Shaky Idea for Some in San Juan
Capistrano</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The depot's neighbors fear construction
would hurt tourism and trains' vibrations would damage mission's
walls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of an ambitious plan to move more trains at faster speeds
along the Southern California coast, Caltrans is considering a
two-mile tunnel that would add two sets of tracks near San Juan
Capistrano's historic downtown district.</LD>
<LD>   The added tracks would involve the demolition of a downtown
parking structure. The tunnel, one of several considerations for
handling trains along the Los Angeles-to-San Diego corridor, is part
of a $10-billion proposal for improving rail transportation
statewide.</LD>
<LD>   The rail plan, which has encountered opposition in other cities,
is doing so in San Juan Capistrano as well. Residents there not only
are protective of the town's historic district but also fear the
construction would chill business and tourism. Some worry the
vibration from the added tracks would be disruptive and damage the
town's old structures, such as its 226-year-old mission.</LD>
<TE>   "The peasants will revolt," said Dave Busk, who owns a large
retail plaza and theater next to the parking structure. "They are not
going to have their ambience and their whole economic viability
destroyed because the tunnel is the cheapest alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Mission officials also are skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "If the trains got any closer, there'd be a whole lot of shaking
going down," said Sandy Wheeler, a mission spokeswoman. "I don't know
if the ruins or the adobe walls could handle that. We've survived
pollution and numerous earthquakes. But I think that would be the
ultimate earthquake to this area."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, still in its tentative stages, builds on Amtrak's
20-year improvement program for the state that would expand service,
increase capacity and shorten trips. Projects include curve
realignments, traffic-control upgrades, underpasses and overpasses,
parking and connections with buses and other mass transit.</TE>
<TE>   Ridership on the Pacific Surfliner, between San Luis Obispo and
San Diego, keeps growing, Amtrak officials said, and the Los
Angeles-to-San Diego run is Amtrak's second-busiest, after the one
from Washington, D.C., to Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak shares rights of way with commuter and freight trains. But
because it doesn't own the tracks, Amtrak usually must yield--causing
delays of up to 30 minutes per trip. With double tracks, the trains
could speed by one another without having to stop anywhere but
stations.</TE>
<TE>   The tunnel and other alternatives for moving train traffic around
San Juan Capistrano have not been formally presented to city
officials. Still, a Caltrans consultant said the idea would be to
carve out a two-mile-long trench for the added tracks and then cover
it, creating a tunnel that would run from a parking lot north of the
existing depot to south of Del Obispo Street near the San Juan Creek
crossing.</TE>
<TE>   It would contain two tracks and possibly a platform. Caltrans
officials said it would be up to Amtrak whether trains would continue
to stop at the existing depot. San Juan Capistrano has had a rail
station since the 1880s.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schibuola, project manager for the technical study, said the
parking structure next to the depot would have to be demolished and
rebuilt. Schibuola said he is aware that the tunnel would move trains
closer to the mission's fragile walls.</TE>
<TE>   "Our vibration specialist will be looking at that," Schibuola
said. "We don't have a lot of room to work with on that alternative.
It's like threading a needle through there."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is also considering an alternative plan for building a
three-mile tunnel under Interstate 5. Schibuola said that tunnel
would begin 1 1/2 miles north of downtown San Juan Capistrano, south
of Junipero Serra Road and continue under the freeway. Another
six-mile tunnel under Interstate 5 in San Clemente is also being
studied.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said tunnels cost anywhere from $80 million to
$200 million a mile.</TE>
<TE>   Other alternatives in San Juan Capistrano include staying with the
existing single tracks or exploring an inland route. Caltrans had
considered adding a second rail through the colorful Los Rios
district, one of the state's oldest neighborhoods. But California
High-Speed Rail Authority officials, who are working with Caltrans on
the project, said that option is no longer being considered.</TE>
<TE>   "With Los Rios on the one side of the tracks and the historic
district on the other, there is not enough room," said Dan Leavitt,
deputy director of the authority.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just barely enough room for one track now."</TE>
<TE>   John Gelff, a San Juan Capistrano councilman, said city leaders
may have relaxed prematurely when they learned that the line from
Irvine to San Diego was no longer being considered as a corridor for
high-speed rail service.</TE>
<TE>   Gelff said that when the high-speed rail proposal was dumped, city
officials concentrated on other issues--such as the controversial
356-home Whispering Hills development and the proposal for a Home
Depot on the edge of town.</TE>
<TE>   "The gravity of this issue is so much bigger than Home Depot
because it would basically destroy their town," said Stephanie Dorey,
a San Clemente councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Gelff favors the inland route but doesn't believe Caltrans is
seriously considering it.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the need for improving the service," said Gelff, who
is pushing for a Caltrans public hearing in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   "But at what cost? Would it be worth it if the walls fell down at
the mission because of the vibration?"</TE>

<LD>A 19-year-old man was arrested in connection with a carjacking in
Oxnard after allegedly leading police on a chase through the city
early Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Lino Felipe Hernandez, 19, was booked on suspicion of carjacking
and armed robbery, said Oxnard police Sgt. Steven Moore. Police are
searching for two other suspects, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez allegedly flagged down a motorist on La Canada Avenue
about 2:45 a.m. Sunday, Moore said. When the driver of the Hyundai
stopped, the two other suspects emerged from hiding, one holding a
shotgun, Moore said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver was robbed of $1,600 and jewelry and he and a passenger
were ordered out of the car at gunpoint, Moore said. The suspects
drove off in the car with Hernandez behind the wheel, he said. An
officer chased the car for four miles before it crashed into a parked
vehicle and the occupants fled.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was captured as he hid on a garage roof at a residence
in the 2000 block of Norma Street, Moore said. Police recovered the
shotgun and $800.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Until a month ago, President Bush held the maddening complexities of
the Arab- Israeli conflict mostly at arms' length. But since he
decided to plunge into Middle East peacemaking, Bush has immersed
himself in the details of diplomacy to a degree that has surprised
even some of his aides.</LD>
<LD>   When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was in the region trying
to achieve a cease-fire, Bush was on the telephone to him at least
once a day--and checked in with his national security advisor,
Condoleezza Rice, as often as 12 times daily. When Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah visited recently, Bush spent five hours with
him and struck a deal on a joint U.S.-Saudi effort to arrange peace
talks. And when a deal was in sight to withdraw Israeli troops from
the Ramallah headquarters of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Bush
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to make it happen.</LD>
<LD>   "He's been engaged directly and intensively," a senior aide said.
"The notion that he wasn't has always been mistaken."</LD>
<TE>   Bush's newfound command of an issue where his experience was
skimpy may appear to conflict with his well-earned reputation as a
man allergic to details and nuance.</TE>
<TE>   But the president's learning curve on the Arab-Israeli conflict
follows a pattern that has become evident on an array of thorny
issues, such as nuclear weapon strategy, tariffs on steel imports and
funding for stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   According to aides and others, Bush sometimes resists wading into
a new subject but eventually demands briefings from his staff,
listens to debates among Cabinet members and ends up knowing more
than some detractors might imagine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the president's active engagement in most of these issues
is a result of the reality of the responsibility of governance," said
Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), who criticized Bush last year for being
insufficiently engaged in policy details.</TE>
<TE>   Overcoming Lack</TE>
<TE>   of Background</TE>
<TE>   During his six years as governor of Texas, Bush succeeded largely
by sticking to a few broad themes and saw little need to bone up on
foreign policy. And that showed during his presidential campaign,
when a reporter ambushed him with a pop quiz and Bush was unable to
name the then-obscure leader of Pakistan. Bush knows Gen. Pervez
Musharraf now.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what he's being forced to address as president are
issues with which he has had no substantive background, knowledge or
experience," said Texas state Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a longtime Bush
watcher and (as a Democrat) a sometime critic.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Bush appears to have learned his foreign policy one
issue at a time, as each forced its way to the front burner.</TE>
<TE>   He boned up on nuclear strategy during the 2000 campaign, when he
decided that making detailed proposals on missile defense would make
him a more credible candidate for commander in chief. He learned
China policy during the crisis caused by Beijing's seizure of a
damaged U.S. surveillance plane in April 2001. He studied Russia when
he saw that only personal diplomacy would persuade Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin to accept U.S. deployment of anti-missile systems.
And he took a crash course in Islamic terrorism and Central Asian
politics after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, learning not only the
name of Musharraf but also those of a dozen wanted Al Qaeda figures
whose profiles he kept on a "scorecard" in his desk.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his current focus on the Middle East, Bush will host
Sharon for talks Tuesday. The next day, Jordan's King Abdullah II
will visit the White House in what will be Bush's 13th meeting with
an Arab head of state.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's forays into foreign policy have not been error-free. During
the China crisis, his initial instinct was to slam the Chinese
publicly, a reaction he--or at least his aides--later regretted. His
efforts to win Arab support for U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East
weren't helped by his public endorsement of Sharon as "a man of
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's approach to new and complex issues appears to follow a
rough pattern. After overcoming whatever reluctance he might have
had, he focuses on the matter with growing intensity, and eventually
immerses himself.</TE>
<TE>   He typically emerges with a stark, black-and-white position,
fitting his own preference for clear, "plain-spoken" views. "My job
isn't to try to nuance," he said last month.</TE>
<TE>   But if his initial, uncomplicated position hits a brick wall, he
often bends. Last month, for example, Bush began his Middle East
diplomacy with a blunt declaration that Arafat was no longer worth
dealing with; he ended up reluctantly rescuing Arafat from the siege
of his Ramallah headquarters and renewing U.S. recognition of the
guerrilla chief as leader of the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   His Instincts Clash</TE>
<TE>   With His Advisors</TE>
<TE>   The resulting picture of Bush is that of a president torn between
his conservative gut instincts and the more moderate counsel of his
advisors. And, more often than not, he opts for the more moderate
path.</TE>
<TE>   Hagel believes that Bush has found a good balance between his
heart and his head.</TE>
<TE>   "The presidency represents a gigantic daily conflict of interests
that pulls a president from his own passions and beliefs and values
on the one hand, and then the reality of an imperfect world on the
other that forces a president to make accommodations in order to
fulfill the larger and maybe more important objectives," Hagel said.
"I think he has found his center of gravity on a lot of this."</TE>
<TE>   Only a year ago, as Democrats took control of the Senate--after
Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont left the GOP to become an
independent--Bush was harshly criticized by some Republicans for
being disengaged.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have to understand issues better, more deeply, get
himself immersed," Hagel said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bush had begun doing just that, as he considered whether
taxpayers should fund embryonic stem cell research. Because of the
question's moral weight for Republican social conservatives, the
decision--at the time--loomed as the most politically sensitive of
his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   In a flurry of self-education, Bush reached out to scientists,
ethicists, physicians and clergy. Even in meetings on other topics,
Bush began soliciting opinions on stem cells--including during a
birthday party for an employee of the White House medical unit.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, his decision this spring to impose tariffs on
foreign steel provided another window into his decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   Given Bush's fierce support for unfettered world trade, the
outcome seemed preordained--but domestic politics complicated
matters. The stakes were enormous for steelworkers in West Virginia
and Pennsylvania, two key battleground states in the 2000
election--and probably in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   With his closest advisors deeply divided, Bush consulted
extensively and even staged a debate in a White House conference room
pitting several of his aides against each other.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he chose a middle-ground position, imposing three-year
tariffs of up to 30% on most imported steel--"temporary safeguards"
that he said would give the industry a chance to "restructure."</TE>
<TE>   Free-trade advocates howled. Bush's decision threatened to erode
his moral authority in pushing other countries to open their markets.
But that did not deter him from doing just that three weeks later in
Mexico, Peru and El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   At least some Democrats like the new, more nuanced Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a surprise to me," Naishtat said, "but a pleasant surprise.
I'd guess a lot of it has to do with him growing and maturing as
president and realizing that he's got to get more immersed in these
issues."</TE>

<HD>E. Coast Fishermen Protest New Guidelines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GLOUCESTER, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of fishermen from New Jersey to Maine gathered Sunday at
this historic port to protest court-ordered restrictions they fear
will destroy commercial fishing in New England's coastal waters.</LD>
<LD>   Cheering and holding signs near 100 fishing boats floating
offshore, the 500 protesters demanded an overhaul of regulations that
close off more areas and slash their annual days at sea from a
maximum of 88 to 70.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to kill it, wipe it out," Myron Lapine, 40, a
fish cutter from Gloucester said about the effect the regulations
would have on the town's future.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm all for conservation but you've got to let these guys fish.
That's all they know. . . . These guys are going to get crushed."</TE>
<TE>   The protest was prompted by an April 26 ruling by U.S. District
Judge Gladys Kessler. The decision came after a coalition of
environmental groups won a federal suit claiming the government
ignored mandates to stop overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations determine fishing days at sea by the average
number of days a fisherman used from 1996 to 2001, less 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen say the rule severely cuts or eliminates fishing for
those who turned away from stocks of ground fish--such as haddock,
cod and flounder--from 1996 to 2001, as the government wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me sick to my stomach," said John O'Leary, 45, a
fishermen from Port Judith, R.I., who will get no days at sea this
year under the new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen have until Tuesday to file a motion asking Kessler to
reconsider her order and until May 26 to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This harbor has seen fishing for 400 years and we're not going to
let it stop now," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group Conservation Law Foundation said the
measures were necessary to save overfished ground fish stocks and
help fishermen in the long run.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>As anti-gun groups across the nation offer everything from cash to
free pizzas to people willing to turn in their firearms, a joyfully
antagonistic pro-gun rights group is giving away handguns to
residents in Chicago, where merely possessing one is a felony.</LD>
<LD>   The first winner is expected to pick up his Kel-Tec .32-caliber
semiautomatic this week. A Hasidic Jew who says his traditional black
hat and long black coat make him feel like a target for anti-Semites,
the man plans to pick up the gun, worth $300, out in the suburbs and
break the law when he crosses back into the city.</LD>

the U.S. with 666 homicides, has, along with Washington, D.C., the
nation's strictest gun control laws. And the city's most powerful and
vocal gun control proponent is Mayor Richard M. Daley.</LD>
<TE>   All of which makes the goal of Concealed Carry Inc. and its
president and chief provocateur, John Birch, all the more delicious.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to pick people who Mayor Daley will have a lot of fun
going up against," Birch said. "I'm going to all his support groups:
gays, women, blacks, Jews, the disabled."</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the first contest--who, since he plans to commit a
felony in the very near future, asked that his name not be used--was
not the group's first choice.</TE>
<TE>   The first man who was set to take the gun, until the media started
poking around, according to Birch: another Jew, who suffered three
bullet wounds in 1999 when white supremacist Benjamin Smith drove
through Illinois and Indiana, shooting blacks, Asians and Jews,
killing two and wounding nine.</TE>
<TE>   The front-runner for the second giveaway: an HIV-positive gay man
who lives in a neighborhood not known for its acceptance of
alternative lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   The handout program, the latest in a series of attempts by Birch
to poke holes in Chicago and Illinois gun laws, began in April with a
posting on Concealed Carry's Web site inviting residents of the
nation's third-largest city to write an essay explaining why they
need handguns to protect themselves.</TE>
<TE>   They had to be 21 or older, able to pass a federal background
check and had to possess an Illinois Firearm Owners Identification
Card--a requirement for all state gun owners and yet another law that
irks gun rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   Extra points were given to women, the disabled and applicants
deemed by the group likely to face a physical threat, being it
working the night shift at a convenience store, having a restraining
order against a former spouse or wearing Hasidic clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Birch, 48, a retired Army reservist who is no relation to the
namesake of the conservative John Birch Society, lives in the suburb
of Oak Brook, where possessing a registered handgun is legal, but
carrying it concealed beneath a jacket or in a pocket is not. He
spends much of his time trying to overturn the state's law against
concealed-carry--Illinois being one of six states to have such a
law--as well as Chicago's ordinance forbidding handgun possession.</TE>
<TE>   Since founding Concealed Carry in 1998, Birch has done much to
keep both topics on the political table.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say I'm surprised that Mr. Birch has come up with another
stunt to draw attention to himself and this issue," said Thomas
Mannard, executive director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun
Violence. "Basically, what Mr. Birch is doing here is hoping that one
of these individuals brings the gun into Chicago, gets arrested and
brings the city's gun ban to court. If he wants that, why doesn't he
do it himself?"</TE>
<TE>   While in no hurry to get arrested, the soon-to-be owner of the new
Kel-Tec says he's thrilled to be joining Birch in his efforts, since
he shares Birch's views.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like I'm being used at all," the man said. "I feel
like maybe I'm using him. I get a free gun. And I definitely feel
like a target."</TE>
<TE>   The winner and Birch agree, however, that they are itching to see
Chicago's ordinance tested in court. Another of Concealed Carry's
1,200 members filed suit last month, asking that some Illinois and
Chicago gun laws be overturned on the grounds that they are
unconstitutional and conflict with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Morley, who is disabled and walks with a cane, says he
decided to sue after being mugged for the fourth time in the last few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Birch, whose sensational methods do not always earn him the
support of other state gun-rights groups, made his public debut in
1999, during a growing debate in the Illinois Legislature over the
concealed-carry law.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing lawmakers were not likely to reduce the charge for
carrying a concealed weapon from a felony to a misdemeanor, he
proposed that they at least exempt from prosecution anyone who
completed a 40-hour firearm training course and passed a criminal
background check.</TE>
<TE>   That idea sank, but Birch soon rose with a new one.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, to legally transport a handgun, the gun must be
unloaded and in a closed case or other container. Many holster makers
produce fanny packs specifically for carrying handguns, and Birch
suggested such packs were legitimate firearm containers.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Birch urged gun owners to take their fanny packs to
one of the city's most crowded events, the annual Taste of Chicago,
where about 3 million people converge on downtown's Grant Park over a
week and a half to sample local food and hear music.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was outraged. The police chief promised to arrest anyone
who tried such a thing. The Cook County state's attorney promised to
prosecute. Local newspapers lambasted the idea as silly and
potentially disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Birch, and five other gun groups that had joined the call, backed
down. Instead, they encouraged like-minded gun owners to carry a
water pistol in the fanny pack, or an unloaded magazine--something to
demonstrate that the owners felt their 2nd Amendment right to bear
arms was being violated.</TE>
<TE>   Now the gun giveaway.</TE>
<TE>   A federally licensed gun dealer, Birch can buy the small
Kel-Tec--often used by police officers as a backup weapon--from a
distributor for just $189.</TE>
<TE>   "At that price, I can keep doing this forever," Birch said. "This
should be fun."</TE>

<LD>In its latest effort to woo Latino voters, the Republican Party is
taking to the Spanish-language airwaves with a 30-minute infomercial
set to run in six cities nationwide, including Fresno.</LD>
<LD>   The project, dubbed Abriendo Caminos, or Forging New Paths, will
contain a mix of news headlines and issue-oriented discussion
produced at Republican national headquarters in Washington. The
monthly program will air as paid advertising on the Telemundo and
Univision networks.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last few years, Latinos have become an increasingly
fought-over segment of the electorate as their population grows in
number and expands beyond a handful of states. President Bush has
been particularly aggressive, hoping to improve upon the 38% of the
Latino vote he won in 2000.</LD>

<HD>Vote Rejects Hemings Claim</HD>
<DH>Genealogy: A group of Jefferson's descendants say DNA
tests, historic evidence are not enough to admit relatives of the
ex-president's slave as bona fide club members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Thomas Jefferson's descendants decided Sunday that DNA
tests and historic evidence are not enough to admit relatives of
Sally Hemings, a Jefferson slave, as bona fide members of their
organization.</LD>
<LD>   The Monticello Assn., whose 700 members are descended from
Jefferson and his daughters, Martha and Maria, opted not to welcome
the Hemings family into the organization. The decision also makes
them ineligible for burial in the family graveyard at Monticello,
Jefferson's estate near Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm terribly disappointed," said Julia Jefferson Westerinen, 67,
Hemings' great-great-great-granddaughter. "It does point out the fact
that the civil rights struggle is not over."</LD>
<TE>   Westerinen had hoped that the Jefferson family would take this
opportunity to make a powerful statement for racial equality and
harmony by embracing Hemings' descendants.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me; it only disappoints me," said Westerinen,
who traces her lineage to Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest son. "I
pity them. I feel they're locked in the cages of their own
prejudice."</TE>
<TE>   But her cousin, Shay Banks-Young, 57, was less resigned.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't lost anything," said Banks-Young, of Columbus, Ohio,
whose ancestor is another Hemings son. "We don't have to prove
anything. It's a fact. Us not being part of this association does not
remove us from the family. That can't be done."</TE>
<TE>   The 74-6 vote showed how determined many of the descendants of
Jefferson's white daughters are to reject what most scholars now
consider historical truth: They share their link to Jefferson with
descendants of a black slave.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of a relationship between the third president and Hemings
have been part of the Hemings family lore for generations and even
were mentioned in newspaper articles during Jefferson's presidency.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, scientists determined through DNA analysis that a male
member of the Jefferson family had fathered Hemings' son Eston. Two
years later, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns Monticello,
studied the DNA results and historical data and announced its
conclusion that Jefferson himself had probably fathered Eston and
possibly fathered all of Hemings' six children.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of the Monticello Assn., which owns the family
graveyard, also was studying the issue. That committee presented its
24-page report over the weekend at the association's annual meeting
in Charlottesville, arguing that there was "not sufficient evidence"
to admit Hemings' descendants.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a racial issue; this is an issue about science and
history," said Nathaniel Abeles of Washington, a project manager for
a software company and the new president of the Monticello Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's merely a decision based on whether the Hemingses have
provided persuasive evidence that they are related to Jefferson,"
added John Works, a past president of the group. "They haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Abeles said the vote brings closure, at least for now, to the
controversy that has shone a spotlight on the annual Jefferson family
meeting for four years. There were 117 Jefferson descendants at this
year's meeting and 120 guests, including 44 members of the Hemings
family.</TE>
<TE>   The association's leadership has tried to downplay the racial
issue, but even during the weekend's meetings, racial tensions
flared.</TE>
<TE>   Lucian Truscott IV, a writer from Los Angeles and the association
member who has led the drive to include the Hemingses, shared an
e-mail he received from Works showing the face of a black man with a
zipper in place of a mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Works said the image was meant to humorously make the point that
Truscott should not talk to the press until after the vote and was
not intended to make a racial statement.</TE>
<TE>   Works said the brouhaha over the e-mail showed how "sensitive" the
issue has become, and he publicly apologized to the association and
the Hemingses.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hemings contingent was clearly offended by the image.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that racism is alive and well in Virginia," Westerinen
said.</TE>
<TE>   Truscott said he was very unhappy about the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "This family, above and beyond all others, should have stood up
and embraced all of its members, but they didn't do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Association members said that if DNA technology improves or if new
historical evidence is uncovered, they may reopen the issue.</TE>
<TE>   But the man who started the controversy by studying the DNA,
retired pathologist Eugene Foster, suggested that there would always
be limits to DNA testing.</TE>
<TE>   "DNA technology may come to the point where the thing may be
settled to satisfy scientists," Foster said. "It probably never will
be settled to the satisfaction of people who don't want to believe
it."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Gives Israel a Vote of Confluence</HD>
<DH>Parade: Marchers in an annual event show solidarity in the
Middle East conflict. But, unlike other such U.S. events, they
decline to criticize Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Solidarity with Israel was on parade Sunday as tens of thousands of
supporters marched up Fifth Avenue in the annual "Salute to Israel"
parade.</LD>
<LD>   Security was tight as religious leaders, politicians and groups
from schools and organizations throughout the region marched through
midtown.</LD>
<LD>   Sidewalks were packed with spectators basking in the sun along the
one-mile route. Organizers expected as many as 1 million viewers, but
that number was unconfirmed.</LD>
<TE>   A few hundred pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered on a street
next to the parade, but no incidents were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many of the rallies seen in New York and around the country
over the last few months, marchers stressed solidarity with Israel
rather than deriding the Palestinian Authority and accusing its
leader, Yasser Arafat, of being a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   However, politicians were quick to put support for Israel in the
context of the current strife in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "Showing solidarity with Israel today is showing solidarity with
America's war on terrorism," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat
from New York who marched with his teenage daughter Jessica.</TE>
<TE>   Before beginning the march, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told
reporters: "Between last year's parade and this year's parade, we had
the terrible tragedy of 9/11, and if New Yorkers don't stand up
today, I don't know when you would."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Zvi Ziegler, assistant principal of Westchester Day School,
said a large turnout sent an important message.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only the marchers should be here but the spectators, this
year more than ever. Everyone should show solidarity with Israel," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Prelate Criticized for Ending Deal in Boston Cases</HD>
<DH>Church: Cardinal Law says too many additional victims came
forward. A local parish priest calls decision to back out of the pact
'tremendously insensitive.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Too many victims were coming forward, Cardinal Bernard Law said
Sunday to explain why the Archdiocese of Boston suddenly withdrew
from a settlement with 86 alleged sexual abuse victims.</LD>
<LD>   At a nearby parish, however, that account rang hollow. And the
lawyer for the 86 victims said the church's retreat from its
agreement was tantamount to revictimization.</LD>
<LD>   "Up until a month ago, we thought there were about 30 more
outstanding claims, beyond those 86," the cardinal said at Mass at
Holy Cross Cathedral here. "In recent weeks however, that number of
30 has grown to an excess of 150 additional claims."</LD>
<TE>   Law told parishioners that the archdiocese's financial council,
which is made up of lay advisors from Boston's business community,
overruled him late Friday by abruptly backing out of the deal that
was nearly a year in the making.</TE>
<TE>   "It was their judgment that the dramatic increase in the number of
cases has substantially altered the situation," Law said. "Their
concern, and I think it is a laudable concern, is that justice and
equity would not be served by agreeing to this settlement for 86
persons, which would thereby negatively affect the response the
archdiocese can later make to the other victims."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, at a parish where the families of at least three
alleged clerical sexual abuse victims are members, Law's words were
greeted with skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "To lay the blame on a lay board is just beyond the pale," said
Father Walter Cuenin, pastor at Our Lady Help of Christians Catholic
Church in Newton, Mass., outside Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "We teach our children that if you say yes to something, you've
got to stay with it. What kind of a message does this send, other
than giving an impression of being tremendously insensitive?"</TE>
<TE>   The settlement, estimated at $15 million to $30 million, would
have established a mediation system to determine individual awards
for alleged victims of former priest John J. Geoghan, who served in
the Boston archdiocese for more than 30 years. Geoghan, convicted in
January of a single count of child molestation, is serving a nine-
to-10 year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Mitchell Garabedian said in an interview Saturday that
church officials here repeatedly assured him during 11 1/2 months of
negotiations that the archdiocese was financially capable of honoring
the proposed settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me they had the money," Garabedian said. His original
group of 86 Geoghan claimants has grown to more than 140 alleged
victims and family members, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Accusing the church of using the agreement as a stalling tactic so
the church could avoid paying victims, Garabedian targeted his ire at
the man who has headed the nation's fourth largest archdiocese since
1984.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinal is a despicable person," Garabedian said. "He has
allowed children to be raped."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer said he will be in court this morning to schedule a
deposition of Law.</TE>
<TE>   After Mass at Our Lady Help of Christians, parishioner Margaret
Hannah said she was "sickened" by the reversal of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Hannah, a 50-year-old mother of three, said her parish council
hand-delivered a letter to Law last week, inviting him to visit the
church to discuss clerical sexual abuse. Law did not respond, Hannah
said.</TE>
<TE>   With 2,700 families in the congregation, the church was at
standing-room capacity Sunday. Many parishioners came to support
three families whose children allegedly were abused by Father Paul
Shanley, arrested Thursday in San Diego on suspicion of child rape.
Shanley waived extradition to Massachusetts and will be arraigned
here this week.</TE>
<TE>   Hannah said many in the congregation also welcomed the leadership
of Cuenin, a priest who Sunday made a point of not mentioning the
cardinal's annual fund-raiser. Cuenin used the morning Mass to
describe how "we in the priesthood feel broken, saddened, shamed and
angered" by the sexual abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Cuenin estimated that about 75% of his congregation wants Law to
step down.</TE>

<LD>Fights over the federal courts are nothing new in American politics.
Thomas Jefferson was incensed in 1801 when his predecessor, John
Adams, stuffed the federal courts with loyal members of his
Federalist Party until his final hours in office. "Mr. A crowded
[them] in with whip and spur," Jefferson complained.</LD>
<LD>   Later, Jefferson quietly prompted his congressional allies to
repeal the law that established the new judgeships Adams filled. And
still--as James F. Simon recounts in his riveting new book, "What
Kind of Nation"--Jefferson fumed over the lingering Federalist
influence in the courts.</LD>
<LD>   For all the animus back then, there's probably never been as much
sustained political conflict over the courts as in the last 15
years--roughly the period since a Democratic Senate rejected
President Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.</LD>
<TE>   Tensions are again rising. On Friday, President Bush lashed the
Democratic Senate for not moving more quickly to confirm his
appointees. He's planning to bang that gong again Thursday, the
one-year anniversary of his first 11 nominations for the powerful
Circuit Courts of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a trivial dispute. The federal district and appellate
courts, not the Supreme Court, resolve most legal battles over civil
rights, environmental regulation and social issues. Both major
political parties understand that control of the courts can shape
domestic policy as much as control of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Are the Democrats being unfair? Like lawyers with dueling expert
witnesses, each side in this conflict has reams of statistics to back
its case. Democrats note that they have confirmed 52 district and
circuit court judges since they took control of the Senate last
summer. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Judiciary Committee
chairman, calculates that's more than the Republican Senate confirmed
under President Clinton in 2000, 1999, 1997 or 1996.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides say those comparisons mislead because Bush has
nominated more judges (100) more quickly than any president before
him. They complain that the Senate has approved a smaller share of
Bush nominees (just more than half) than it accepted during Clinton's
first months (60%).</TE>
<TE>   Amid the competing numbers, the bottom line seems to be that the
Senate is approving nominees for the federal district courts at a
pace even the White House considers reasonable. But the spigot is
still clogged for Bush's choices to the more influential circuit
courts.</TE>
<TE>   He has nominated 30 Circuit Court judges; the Senate has confirmed
just nine. The Judiciary Committee voted down one, Mississippi
federal judge Charles Pickering; 20 more (including eight of Bush's
original 11) are awaiting action. And given the opposition they have
provoked from liberal groups, some could wait for a very long time.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Middle East, bitterness over yesterday's atrocities
complicates today's disputes. When Republicans held the Senate, they
engaged in what Democrats saw as a deliberate strategy of blocking
Clinton's nominees to the circuit courts. From 1995 through 2000, the
Republican Senate refused to confirm more than 35% of Clinton's
appellate court nominees. That was significantly more than the 25% of
nominees the Democratic Senate rejected from 1986 through 1992 under
Reagan and the earlier President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, the Republican majority never provided a public vote
(as Democrats did with Pickering) for any of the 24 Clinton Circuit
Court nominees it rejected; the nominations were simply left to
expire without action, largely because individual senators blocked
consideration. (Under Senate tradition in both parties, the Judiciary
Committee won't consider nominees until their home-state senators
sign off.)</TE>
<TE>   Of the 24, only two even received a hearing. None of Clinton's
nominees to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ever received a hearing.
One of them, Michigan state Judge Helene White, waited more than
1,500 days without a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Clinton left office, the number of Circuit Court
vacancies had more than doubled, from 16 to 33. Those openings have
created the opportunity for Bush to nominate many judges, but also
dimmed his prospects of winning their confirmations. Democrats and
their allies argue that to allow Bush to tilt the circuit courts to
the right would reward him for the unprecedented Republican
obstruction of Clinton's choices.</TE>
<TE>   That general principle is translating into hard-nosed negotiating
over specific nominations. Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl
Levin and Debbie Stabenow, are blocking several of Bush's nominees to
the 6th Circuit, arguing that he should also resubmit some of the
rejected Clinton choices. Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) is doing the
same thing in the 4th Circuit, where every Clinton nominee was
blocked by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).</TE>
<TE>   The White House response has been succinct: no deals. The
administration seems to be hunkering down until November, when it is
hoping voters will deliver it a Republican Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Each side has an argument here. The White House says Bush
shouldn't be penalized for what Senate Republicans did before he
arrived; Democrats say he shouldn't benefit from it, either. Lost in
the partisan standoff is the broader national interest in filling the
vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a lasting solution, it probably can be found in a
two-step compromise. Step one would try to break the existing logjam
through an old-fashioned horse trade: Senate Democrats could agree to
accept more of Bush's picks in return for the White House nominating
a smaller number of judges the Democrats prefer (including former
Clinton choices). Step two would try to prevent another crisis by
writing into Senate or Judiciary Committee rules a guarantee that all
future judicial nominees would receive a hearing and a public vote by
the panel.</TE>
<TE>   In a nation whose political allegiances are divided in half, any
president will inevitably face resistance to his most ideological
judicial nominees; some of Bush's edgier choices are unlikely to be
approved as long as Democrats hold the Senate majority. But the
Senate clearly needs new rules of the road that will put more bodies
on the bench, require senators to cast a recorded vote to block a
president's selection and assure more equitable treatment for the
nominees themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Even judges should be guaranteed their day in court.</TE>

<HD>Officials Warn Postal Bomber May Head West</HD>
<DH>Crime: The dozen-plus devices left in rural Midwest
mailboxes are the work of the same person, authorities believe. More
strikes are thought to be likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Postal authorities, bracing for the prospect of more pipe bombings,
warned its managers in Midwest and Western states Sunday that whoever
left more than a dozen explosives in mailboxes in Illinois, Iowa and
Nebraska last week could be heading their way.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities now believe that the bombs left in rural mailboxes in
the three states are all the work of the same person.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI is trying to determine why none of the six pipe bombs
found in Nebraska mailboxes Saturday exploded, even after several
were handled by unwitting residents. One theory, investigators said,
is that unlike the bombs found in Iowa and Illinois on Friday, the
Nebraska explosives were not designed to go off on contact. Six
people were injured in Friday's incidents.</LD>
<TE>   One more pipe bomb was found in a Nebraska mailbox Sunday
night--in Albion. It didn't explode and police had not determined
whether it was linked to other incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that it is very possible, if not likely, that
the pipe-bomber will strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working as quickly as we can to determine what kind of
pattern we're seeing, and the historical profiles are telling us that
it's unlikely this individual is going to suddenly stop" leaving pipe
bombs, said Richard Watkins, a postal official in Des Moines.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials held a teleconference Sunday afternoon with top
district managers from the Midwest and Mountain states, including
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Kansas and
Missouri, to alert them to the possibility that the pipe bomber could
be heading their way, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "Or he may make a circle and head back" toward the East, Watkins
said. "We don't know. That's the danger in trying to get too far
ahead of ourselves. We have to take what we know and head from
there."</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials plan to resume mail delivery today in the
affected areas of Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska, with carriers urged to
take extra safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   The pipe bombs left in Iowa and Illinois included copies of a note
angrily railing against vague government abuses and saying that the
explosives were "attention getters" to force change. Authorities
believe that most or all of the six Nebraska bombs also included
notes, but several were destroyed when authorities detonated the
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Terri Teuber, a spokeswoman for the Nebraska State Patrol, said
that "we have every reason to believe that these incidents were
connected to those in the other states. The devices are similar and
there were notes that were similar."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators would not characterize the contents of the notes
found Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Nebraska explosives all came in Ziploc-type plastic bags, said
FBI agent Peter Sakaris in Omaha. Like the explosives found in Iowa
and Illinois, the bombs were made of metal pipe about 6 inches long
and were battery-powered, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Sakaris said investigators were anxious to determine why none of
the Nebraska bombs exploded, even after several residents handled
them. According to neighbors, one homeowner threw one device into a
ditch after noticing that it looked suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think that [handling] would activate it, but it's hard
to speculate on why it didn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One possibility is that whoever left the second batch of bombs
intended only to scare people--and "grab" more attention--rather than
inflict more damage. But officials at the FBI, which is investigating
the bombings as acts of "domestic terrorism," cautioned that it was
too early to draw any conclusions about who is responsible or what
the motive might be.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still investigating the case. There are no breakthroughs,"
Sakaris said.</TE>
<TE>   Postal officials have inspected thousands of rural boxes in the
areas where the bombs were found, and Watkins said inspectors also
have begun searching Postal Service files for any threatening
anti-government letters sent to the post office that might produce
leads.</TE>
<TE>   Monday is the busiest mail day of the week, and postal officials
were working Sunday to come up with stepped-up safety precautions for
letter carriers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa, postal officials announced new guidelines Sunday, saying
letter carriers will only make deliveries to rural roadside mailboxes
that are left open. Customers are asked to tape or tie open the lids
of the boxes so carriers can determine they are safe.</TE>
<TE>   For rural carriers in Iowa and Illinois, where routes were
suspended Friday for about 400,000 addresses, "obviously there's
going to be a great deal of anxiety, one would have to assume, but
they want to get back out to work," Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously concerned with the safety of our employees, and
we want to determine what's the safest way to get the mail
delivered," he said.</TE>

<LD>   The ancestor of all the grains, fruits and blossoms of the modern
world may have been a fragile water plant that lived in a Chinese
lake 125 million years ago. The plant, called Archaefructus sinensis
for "ancient fruit from China," is of a species never before seen and
carries the clear characteristics of the most primitive of flowering
plants, said David Dilcher of the University of Florida.</LD>
<LD>   "It is like the mother of all flowering plants," said Dilcher,
co-author of a study appearing in the May 3 issue of Science. "It
changes our whole impression of what is the oldest of all flowering
plants." Botanists had long considered a woody plant from New
Caledonia as the most ancient of flowering plants. The discovery also
suggests that flowering plants got their start as herbs growing in
shallow pools and were able to reproduce quickly, a distinct
advantage for survival, said Dilcher.</LD>

<LD>   Pregnant mice deprived of vitamin C give birth to infants that die
almost immediately from bleeding in the brain and respiratory
distress, researchers from the National Human Genome Research
Institute reported in the May issue of Nature Medicine. In humans,
brain hemorrhages, lung complications and respiratory failure
frequently cause death in premature infants, and vitamin C
deficiencies may play a role there as well, said Dr. Robert Nussbaum,
the lead researcher.</LD>
<LD>   The only documented role for vitamin C is the prevention of
scurvy, which is characterized by bleeding gums, anemia, skin
hemorrhages and death. The new research indicates that it is also
crucial for producing collagen, the structural matrix that holds
tissues together.</LD>

<LD>   For more than 2,000 years, healers in India have used a tree resin
as a folk medicine to treat a variety of ailments. Modern researchers
now find it effective in controlling high cholesterol.</LD>
<LD>   The tree is known in India as guggul. Its sap contains a compound
that blocks the action of a cell receptor, called FXR, which helps
regulate a body's cholesterol level, said David D. Moore, a molecular
biologist at the Baylor School of Medicine in Houston. He is
co-author of a study that appeared Friday in Science Express, the
electronic version of the journal Science.</LD>
<TE>   "Our results suggest that other compounds that could affect FXR
could also control cholesterol," Moore said. "This mechanism is
completely different from the action of statin drugs," which are
taken by millions to control cholesterol.</TE>

<HD>An Empire's Epidemic</HD>
<DH>Scientists Use DNA in Search for Answers to 6th Century
Plague</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By the middle of the 6th century, the Emperor Justinian had spread
his Byzantine Empire around the rim of the Mediterranean and
throughout Europe, laying the groundwork for what he hoped would be a
long-lived dynasty.</LD>
<LD>   His dreams were shattered when disease-bearing mice from lower
Egypt reached the harbor town of Pelusium in AD 540. From there, the
devastating disease spread to Alexandria and, by ship, to
Constantinople, Justinian's capital, before surging throughout his
empire.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Justinian's plague had run its course in AD 590, it
had killed as many as 100 million people--half the population of
Europe--brought trade to a near halt, destroyed an empire and,
perhaps, brought on the Dark Ages. Some historians think that the
carnage may also have sounded the death knell for slavery as the high
demand for labor freed serfs from their chains.</LD>
<TE>   Justinian's plague was a "major cataclysm," says historian Lester
K. Little, director of the American Academy in Rome, "but the amount
of research that has been done by historians is really minimal."</TE>
<TE>   Little is hoping to do something about that. In December, he
brought the world's plague experts together in Rome to lay the
groundwork for an ambitious research program on the pandemic. A book
resulting from the meeting will be published this year.</TE>
<TE>   Modern techniques for studying DNA have begun answering
long-standing questions about the evolution of the plague bacillus,
how it infects humans and what can be done to counteract it.</TE>
<TE>   While a 6th century plague might seem an esoteric subject, Little
and others think that it has great relevance in a modern world that
is continually threatened by emerging diseases. A second pandemic of
plague struck Europe in the Middle Ages--the so-called Black
Death--killing 25 million people and once more producing widespread
social disruption.</TE>
<TE>   A third pandemic began in China in the late 19th century and
spread to North America, where a large reservoir of the disease
remains active in animals throughout the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   An outbreak occurred in Los Angeles in 1924-25, but was contained.</TE>
<TE>   Plague could become a tool of bioterrorists. Russian experts have
long argued that plague is a much more frightening prospect than
anthrax. As part of their germ war efforts during the Cold War,
Soviet scientists developed strains of plague resistant to
antibiotics used to cure infections. Unleashing such organisms could
potentially have a devastating effect on modern society.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding Justinian's plague could also lead to insights into
other types of disasters, man-made and natural, adds UCLA historian
Michael Morony.</TE>
<TE>   "People were dying faster than they could be buried," he said. "I
find myself wondering how society survived. That's a relevant
question to try to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Plague is caused by a bacillus called Yersinia pestis, identified
in 1894 by the Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin. The bacterium
once killed more than half the people it infected but is now
routinely controlled by such antibiotics as streptomycin, gentamicin
or tetracycline.</TE>
<TE>   Plague Still Kills</TE>
<TE>   2,000 People a Year</TE>
<TE>   About 2,000 deaths from plague are still reported worldwide every
year, a handful of them in the United States. Naturally occurring
strains resistant to antibiotics have been observed recently,
however, and scientists fear that their spread could lead to large
outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   Y. pestis is carried by rats and other animals. It can be
transmitted to humans by direct exposure to an infected animal. Most
often, however, it is carried by fleas that bite the infected
animals, then bite humans.</TE>
<TE>   People bitten by such fleas develop agonizingly painful, egg-sized
swellings of the lymph nodes--called buboes--in the neck, armpit and
groin. Hence the name bubonic plague.</TE>
<TE>   Some authorities recognize two other forms of plague, one called
pulmonary or pneumonic, in which the lungs are affected, and one
called septicemic, in which the organism invades the bloodstream, but
all are the same disease, Little said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its possible use in bioterrorism, researchers have been
actively studying the plague organism. In October, a British team
from the Sanger Center in Cambridge reported that they had decoded
the complete DNA sequence of Y. pestis, a feat that could help to
control outbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   "The genome sequence we have produced contains every possible drug
or vaccine target for the organism," said Dr. Julian Parkhill, the
team's leader.</TE>
<TE>   Genetics shows that the closest relative of Y. pestis is a gut
bacterium called Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which is transmitted
through food and water and which causes diarrhea, gastroenteritis and
other intestinal problems, but is rarely fatal. Y. pseudotuberculosis
may be the immediate ancestor of Y. pestis, but it is not transmitted
by fleas. Last month, researchers apparently discovered why.</TE>
<TE>   Bacteriologist B. Joseph Hinnebusch and his colleagues at the
National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in
Montana reported that the key is a gene called PDL, which is carried
by the plague bacterium, but not by the one that causes diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   Although they do not yet know how it works, PDL allows Y. pestis
to survive in the gut of the rat flea. Artificially produced strains
of the bacterium without the gene are destroyed in the flea's gut and
thus cannot be transmitted to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Hinnebusch and his colleagues believe the bacterium acquired the
gene from other soil bacteria by a process called horizontal
transfer, somewhat akin to a form of bacterial sex. The transfer
probably took place 1,500 to 20,000 years ago, they said, setting the
stage for full-scale epidemics of plague. "Our research illustrates
how a single genetic change can profoundly affect the evolution of
disease," Hinnebusch said.</TE>
<TE>   Some scholars have argued that Y. pestis was not the cause of the
Black Death and, by implication, of Justinian's plague as well. Jean
Durliat, a French expert on the Byzantine Empire, argued in the 1980s
that contemporary literary accounts of Justinian's plague were
overblown and exaggerated, and not supported by archeological
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, British historians Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan
published "Biology of Plagues," arguing that death spread through
Europe much too rapidly in the 14th century to be caused by Y.
pestis.</TE>
<TE>   They believe that the Black Death must have spread through
human-to-human contact and argue that it might have been caused by
the Ebola virus or something similar.</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologist James Wood of Pennsylvania State University made a
similar argument last month at a meeting in Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "This disease appears to spread too rapidly among humans to be
something that must first be established in wild rodent populations,
like bubonic plague," Wood said. "An analysis of monthly mortality
rates [among priests] during the epidemic shows a 45-fold greater
risk of death than during normal times, far higher than usually
associated with bubonic plague."</TE>
<TE>   But molecular biology may be on the brink of answering questions
that history cannot. One unique feature of the plague virus is that
it accumulates inside the teeth of its victims, where its DNA can be
protected for centuries, or perhaps even longer.</TE>
<TE>   Molecular biologists Michel Drancourt and Olivier Dutour of the
University of the Mediterranean in Marseilles, France, reported in
1998 that they had identified Y. pestis DNA in human remains dating
from 1590 and 1722. Two years later, they reported a similar finding
in remains dating from 1348.</TE>
<TE>   That evidence is "pretty impressive," said Little, and indicates
that Y. pestis at the very least played a role in the Black Death.</TE>
<TE>   The Marseilles team is continuing to study other remains from the
period to document how widespread the infections were. Meanwhile,
archeologists are searching for plague cemeteries from the time of
Justinian to perform similar studies.</TE>
<TE>   Mass Graves Found</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza to Be Studied</TE>
<TE>   Archeologist Michael McCormick of Harvard University has already
identified eight mass graves in the Gaza Strip, Turkey and Italy
where he expects to find human remains dating from the 6th to the 8th
centuries. Remains have yet to be exhumed, however.</TE>
<TE>   Some researchers speculate that a particularly virulent form of Y.
pestis was responsible for Justinian's plague or the Black Death,
just as an unusually pathogenic form of the influenza virus caused
the worldwide flu pandemic in the early 20th century. Analysis of
human remains could yield clues.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, McCormick said, if DNA is found in the remains, it
could be possible to grow the organisms in the laboratory and see if
it is, in fact, more virulent.</TE>
<TE>   One of the "major social issues" arising from the great mortality
of the plague "is that it tends to raise the value of labor," Little
said. "There are not enough workers around anymore. You can't find
servants and, when you do find someone, they tend to charge
outrageous amounts."</TE>
<TE>   Little and others believe that this increased premium on labor was
the final blow to slavery during the Justinian plague and that it
similarly brought an end to serfdom during the Black Death.</TE>
<TE>   Historians obviously still have a lot to learn about these
pandemics, but valuable first steps have been taken, Little said.
With the increasing assistance of molecular biologists, he added, the
final pieces of the puzzle may now fall into place.</TE>

<HD>Scientists Describe New Form of Life as 'Weird Bug'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have discovered an entirely new type of creature--one that
does not fit into any previous category of life--lurking in an
undersea vent north of Iceland.</LD>
<LD>   The creatures are small spheres attached to other organisms and
are so genetically strange and so tiny--smaller than a grain of sand
and about the width of four human hairs--that they were invisible to
traditional ecological survey methods.</LD>
<LD>   "Even the ultimate molecular ecology methods could not detect our
new microbes because they are so different from everything known so
far," said Karl Stetter, a professor of microbiology at the
University of Regensburg in Germany who led the discovery team.</LD>
<TE>   Stetter and his colleagues detected the creatures only after
growing them in hot, oxygen-free and high-pressure conditions to
simulate their natural hostile environs.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp eyes and a nifty lab tool called optical tweezers--which let
scientists manipulate tiny and fragile objects with a laser beam
focused through a microscope--allowed Stetter's team to separate the
organisms from their hosts. But they could not survive separately,
suggesting they are symbionts.</TE>
<TE>   Molecular ecologists use existing DNA probes to hunt for new
organisms. Because this creature is such a "weird bug," said
evolutionary biologist W. Ford Doolittle of Dalhousie University in
Nova Scotia, the German scientists needed to create customized
genetic tools to detect it.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA of the "nano-sized hyperthermophilic archaeon" is
interesting because it is so minimal. Containing just 500 kilobases,
the genome is among the smallest known. (Compare it to 6 million
kilobases for humans and 9 million for corn.)</TE>
<TE>   The genome is smaller than some viruses and in the range of the
smallest living organisms known--mycoplasma, or bacterial parasites.</TE>
<TE>   In an article accompanying the new research in the current issue
of the journal Nature, Doolittle called it "a genome begging to be
sequenced." Stetter, who is also a faculty member at UCLA, said it
provides "insights into the minimum equipment of a living cell."</TE>
<TE>   The new creatures, formally named Nanoarchaeum equitans, may
represent an entirely new grouping with the Archaea, the most
mysterious of life's three domains. (The others are
eukaryotes--organisms with nucleated cells like people, plants and
fungi--and bacteria.)</TE>
<TE>   And even stranger discoveries could lie ahead. "There is a very
good chance," Stetter said, "that still-undiscovered continents of
microbial life do exist on our planet."</TE>

<HD>Vote on a City Before You Elect Its Mayor</HD>
<DH>Concurrent elections would muddy the secession issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF DAAR</AU>
<BD>Jeff Daar, a lawyer, is a co-chair and steering
committee member of One Los Angeles, the Valley-based anti-secession
group.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles will be embarking on a roller-coaster ride if
San Fernando Valley secession is placed on the November ballot.
Adding insult to injury, the executive officer of the entity that
decides whether the city votes on secession has recommended a
concurrent vote in the Valley for a mayor and city council.</LD>
<LD>   Voters throughout the city already would have a lot to consider in
deciding whether the 1.4 million people in the Valley should secede
and form what would be the sixth-largest city in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   An extra Valley election would require candidates to run for
positions that might never be needed. Some ambitious politicians
might spend millions of dollars to be elected mayor, while other
deserving candidates probably would be deterred from running for
offices that didn't exist yet.</LD>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission's recommendation also is for
a Valley mayor and city council to be elected by the greatest number
of votes, even if the figure represents only 15%. There would not be
a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   All of this extra politicking in the Valley would confuse and
distract voters. Candidates for Valley mayor and council could spend
millions of dollars. This additional campaigning would unfairly
promote secession in the Valley and would improperly skew the
citywide vote. Further, it would be a waste of taxpayer dollars to
hold an election in the Valley for positions that might not be needed
if secession was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   If secession passes, a separate election for Valley leaders could
take place in March 2003, when Los Angeles (including the Valley) is
scheduled to have a regular election. No valid reason exists that can
justify having the Valley elect a new mayor and council without a
runoff and before the voters first decide if they want to form a new
city.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who signed the petition that asked for a vote on Valley
secession never asked for the bizarre election being recommended on
their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   We must insist that LAFCO require a separate election. If it does
not, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors and the state Legislature
must show leadership and require a fair election. As a last resort,
the courts must be asked to prevent the election on secession from
being skewed by the circus that would result from a concurrent
election in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The key decision of whether to break up the city of Los Angeles
should be based on one citywide vote that is not eclipsed in the
Valley by a secondary election for nonexistent Valley offices.</TE>

<HD>Devastation Only Feeds Resistance to Israeli Rule</HD>
<DH>The question now is whether Sharon can be stopped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUSSEIN IBISH</AU>
<BD>Hussein Ibish is communications director for the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only has Israel been allowed to prevent a United Nations
investigation into serious allegations of war crimes in Jenin by
Israeli troops, it has placed Yasser Arafat in a daunting position.
He is now seen to have benefited, personally and politically, from
the exchange of his freedom for the truth.</LD>
<LD>   In a deal that shocks the conscience, the United States reportedly
agreed to shield Israel from action by the U.N. Security Council to
enforce its resolution to send a fact-finding team to discover the
truth about what happened in the devastated Jenin camp. This was in
exchange for lifting the siege on Arafat's compound in Ramallah. Both
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have just issued reports
accusing Israeli forces of committing serious war crimes in Jenin.
These partial and preliminary findings may be the last serious
attempts to discover the facts.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, it would seem, is once again to be the exception, shielded
by the United States from the enforcement of international law and
norms of conduct, allowed to defy any number of U.N. Security Council
resolutions with impunity.</LD>
<TE>   Since Arafat has become implicated in this exchange as a direct
beneficiary, some of the public outrage will inevitably rest on his
shoulders. Preferring to change the subject, some official
Palestinian rhetoric already has shifted from the "massacre at Jenin"
to the "heroic resistance at Jenin."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority also agreed to place six Palestinians,
wanted by Israel for an assassination and weapons purchases, in a
Palestinian jail under U.S. and British monitors. This only
underscored the impression that Arafat paid a humiliating and costly
price for his temporary and limited freedom. The Israeli demands for
these prisoners were particularly galling coming from a state that
routinely had been assassinating its Palestinian political rivals,
killing more than 60 of them in the past 18 months along with many of
their wives and children, as well as bystanders. All this offers very
little benefit to the Palestinian people, who remain under Israeli
military lock-down.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat at last emerged from his besieged compound into a wasteland
devastated by the Israeli army, but he has not received the hero's
welcome he may have expected--although some cast his mere physical
and political survival as a "victory."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that Israel's attacks have destroyed the ability of
the Palestinian Authority to function as a government and law
enforcement entity among Palestinians in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have systematically destroyed all aspects of the
nascent Palestinian state, including school, land and property
records and the files of human-rights groups and other
nongovernmental organizations, independent media and medical
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of these outrages, the U.S. Congress continues to pass
resolutions, as it did last week, of uncritical support for Israel
that reflect no understanding or concern about the plight of the
Palestinians or the fact that millions of them live under Israeli
military occupation.</TE>
<TE>   One has to wonder what for many in Congress, short of the physical
extermination of the entire Palestinian population, would be seen as
unacceptable Israeli conduct.</TE>
<TE>   House Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey's repeated calls on
MSNBC for the removal of all Palestinians from the West Bank simply
takes the general attitude on Capitol Hill to its grim but logical
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Israeli offensive, Arafat's standing is greatly
weakened, the Palestinian people seethe with rage, Israel is further
isolated, American credibility is damaged and the authority of the
U.N. is undermined. Viewing the wreckage with evident pride, Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has declared that "peace is at hand."</TE>
<TE>   The irony is, of course, that this devastation will only increase,
not break, the will of the Palestinians to resist Israeli rule. There
is every reason to expect that coming months will see an
intensification of the conflict, especially since there are no
political negotiations in place to substitute for the violence of
recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The only question left is whether any limits will be placed on how
far Israel is allowed to go in enforcing its occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has run over a refugee camp with tanks and then stopped the
international community's investigation of its action. How long will
it be before it expels the populations of entire towns and regions,
while the U.S. Congress passes resolutions of uncritical support and
President Bush describes Sharon as a "man of peace"?</TE>

<HD>Arafat's Failure May Offer Seeds of Hope</HD>
<DH>Perhaps his people can at last be freed from the obsession
to destroy Israel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL PIPES</AU>
<BD>Daniel Pipes is director of the Philadelphia-based
Middle East Forum.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat's decision to place six Palestinians under the control
of American and British jailers in return for his personal release
from captivity is getting mixed reviews on the Palestinian "street."</LD>
<LD>   But the Palestinian Authority's main mistake reaches deeper than
tactical missteps of this sort. Far more serious, it is pursuing a
failed strategy against Israel. Nor does it seem to realize the
damage it is doing to its goals. This strategic error eventually will
cost the Palestinians their fight against Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The current round of fighting--what I call the Palestinian-Israeli
war--began in September 2000, four months after Arafat and his
colleagues witnessed how steady violence against Israeli troops in
Lebanon had demoralized the Israeli body politic and led to a sudden
and total evacuation of Israeli forces from Lebanon.</LD>
<TE>   Impressed by what the Lebanese had achieved, Arafat began a
copycat effort aimed at destroying Israel by demoralizing its
population, causing the Jews to flee the country, plead for terms and
eventually capitulate.</TE>
<TE>   This strategy initially worked. On Oct. 7, 2000, the Israelis
retreated from Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish holy site in Nablus, after
their forces came under fire from a street rabble. On capturing the
site, Palestinians desecrated Hebrew texts. They felt understandably
exultant, for they had defeated the mighty Israel Defense Forces.</TE>
<TE>   Although it certainly looked like Israel was sliding into defeat,
a remarkable thing happened: a profound change in mood. Israelis came
to realize that they were fighting for their survival. Lebanon was
just a means to defend Israel and could be given up, but Israel
itself had to be fought for.</TE>
<TE>   A people who just months before had insisted on ending the
conflict now accepted the need to fight on. A divided people became
united. A dispirited population became mobilized. They overwhelmingly
voted for a new and tougher government led by Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, however, did not see this change. Unaware of the
effect of their hammering away at Israelis, they kept up an assault
of suicide bombers and snipers. In a mood of exuberance, the
Palestinians barely noticed what damage they were doing to their
cause. The killing of Israel's tourism minister last October, for
example, caused Sharon to harden his position against Arafat and not
accept him as a negotiating partner.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the "Passover massacre"--the March suicide murder of 29
Israelis as they celebrated the Jewish holiday--did not benefit the
Palestinians but led to the virtual dismantling of the Palestinian
Authority, the death of many of its combatants and the arrest of
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Palestinians have not recognized that continued
violence against Israel is not working, their many steps backward in
recent weeks seem to have waked at least some of them to the
magnitude of their mistake.</TE>
<TE>   I predict that this round of the Palestinian war on Israel, now 19
months long, will collapse fairly soon--probably well before the end
of this year. I also predict that the Palestinians will at that time
find themselves adrift, with a strategy proven wrong, an economy near
collapse and a sundered leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, this time of darkness and misery, if understood
properly by a new Palestinian leadership and handled correctly by the
outside world, could have very positive implications.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, only Palestinian acceptance of the existence of Israel
will resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. This means that if the
Palestinians can learn the right lesson from their failure, they will
give up on their half-century dream of eliminating Israel and instead
deploy their considerable talents at building a better life for
themselves. They will realize that liberating themselves from their
obsession with destroying Israel must precede any progress on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   If they do, then this terrible moment will one day be seen as
having within it the seeds of a better future.</TE>

<HD>The Top Priority: Community Policing</HD>
<DH>L.A.'s next chief must foster police-resident relations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WELLFORD W. WILMS, WARREN H. SCHMIDT and ALEX J. NORMAN</AU>
<BD>Wellford W. Wilms, a UCLA professor of education and
policy studies; Warren H. Schmidt, USC professor emeritus of policy
and planning, and Alex J. Norman, UCLA professor emeritus of policy
and social research, conducted a study of LAPD community policing
between 1995 and 2001. Their report will be released in June.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the upheaval over former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks is over, what qualities are important in his successor?</LD>
<LD>   We have studied the LAPD for the past six years, and we believe
that the answer is a commitment to community policing.</LD>
<LD>   After the Rodney G. King beating in 1991, the Christopher
Commission said replacing the LAPD's "command and control" culture
with one that supported community policing was essential. If police
and residents could work together around common interests,
misperceptions and misunderstandings would break down and crime
problems could be solved before they became statistics.</LD>
<TE>   Community policing is not a quick fix, because it requires
fundamental changes in police culture. In Baltimore, Birmingham,
Ala., Houston, Newark, N.J., and Oakland, it has shown results. Fear
of crime and actual crime rates have fallen.</TE>
<TE>   But in Los Angeles, a decade and two police chiefs later,
community policing is mostly just rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parks' predecessor, Willie Williams, attracted
considerable support for the idea of community policing from city
leaders and citizens, he failed to win support within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   When Parks took over, he launched a blizzard of new initiatives,
which took away from the goal of community policing. The captains who
commanded the LAPD's 18 geographic areas were buried under an
avalanche of new orders. To accommodate the workload, Parks
reassigned the 168 senior lead officers--the very officers who were
on the front line of community policing--back to the field.</TE>
<TE>   Parks also developed a strict new citizen complaint system that
investigated even the most trivial offenses by officers.
Investigations took up to a year to complete--during which time
accused officers could not be promoted or transferred--depressing
officer morale and further reducing any fledgling community policing
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   We conducted three officer surveys, in 1996-1997, 1998 and
1999-2000. Not surprisingly, our latest survey showed that beginning
in 1998, a year after Parks took over, officers' job satisfaction
declined dramatically. Nearly 80% said they feared being punished for
making an honest mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Officers' increasingly negative feelings translated into the
highest rates of attrition in the department's history. In such a
climate and absent leadership from Parks, the commitment to community
policing withered.</TE>
<TE>   We believe that there is something to be learned by comparing
Parks' authoritarian style, which produced fear throughout the ranks
and diminished officers' willingness to become involved with
citizens, and Williams' lack of control, which inadvertently produced
some localized division experiments with community policing.</TE>
<TE>   "Williams was asleep at the switch," one commander said, "but it
allowed us to get things done."</TE>
<TE>   Connie Dial, captain at the Hollywood Division between 1996 and
when she retired in 1999, decided to implement community policing.
"The first thing we did was to get our officers working with citizens
who were worried about crime," she said. "The officers quickly
learned that they had a supportive community and the residents saw
that the police didn't fit their stereotypes."</TE>
<TE>   Dial said neighbors worried about burglaries and business owners
about drug addicts hanging around their stores. "Two officers
volunteered to work on it for a month, and with the help of residents
they figured out it was the 'hypes' who were committing the
burglaries. We beefed up the operation, got support from the city
attorney's office and started making a huge number of arrests."</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, Dial said, Hollywood was making more arrests than nearly
any other division. In the same period, Dial said, Hollywood
robberies declined 31% and burglaries 17%. "Community policing
doesn't mean being soft on crime," she said. "You just have to know
the root of the problem before you can target the resources. Everyone
was part of the solution and it didn't cost a single extra officer or
car."</TE>
<TE>   And when officers' job satisfaction ratings began to plunge in
other divisions, Hollywood's officers' satisfaction and morale rose.
Eighty-three percent said they felt they were part of a team. More
than two-thirds said they were encouraged to try new ideas; 91% rated
their captains as good leaders. But when Parks removed the senior
lead officers, Dial said, "The impact was devastating. It was a real
blow to community policing."</TE>
<TE>   Our research makes clear that LAPD officers, like Angelenos in
general, are waiting for new leadership. Surveys show that most
officers say they are in police work to make the community safer and
to help people. And most support community policing.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few months, the Los Angeles Police Commission will
forward three names to Mayor James Hahn, from which he will choose a
new chief of police. For the commission and for Hahn, the past 10
years should be their guide.</TE>

<HD>Head Off New Water Wars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of the ugly battles of past droughts. Farmers pitted against
cities, with the media showing pictures of flooded rice fields at a
time when town and suburban lawns went unwatered and toilets
unflushed. Cities vying for dwindling water supplies, north scorning
south. The salmon losing out altogether.</LD>
<LD>   The idea of regressing to this state of affairs is repellent, but
an extraordinary seven-year effort to end California's long, bitter
water warfare is on the verge of collapse. The state's elected
officials in Sacramento and Washington need to rally their forces to
prevent a return to water chaos that would threaten the reliability
of Southern California's supply and further risk the environment of
two major rivers and the state's biggest estuary.</LD>
<LD>   Congress urgently needs to pass legislation to renew authorization
of Cal-Fed, the $8.5-billion cooperative state-federal program to
revitalize the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The delta is the nexus
of water systems that serve 22 million Californians, including all of
coastal Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   The state and federal governments are partners in Cal-Fed because
they both have giant water projects drawing from the delta for
shipment south. The massive sucking of the pumps has caused much of
the environmental degradation of the delta, including alarming
declines in fish populations.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-Fed brought together the big users of this water--farmers and
urban water agencies such as the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California--and the environmental community. They battled
through thousands of hours of meetings to achieve a plan to restore
the delta and upstream watershed, revive salmon runs, stabilize water
supplies and improve the quality of the water exported to the south,
now heavily laden with salt.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is unraveling largely because farmers believe too
much money and water is going to the environment and not enough to
their fields. They are asking Congress to give them what they
couldn't get through Cal-Fed, including costly new reservoirs.
Environmentalists are appropriately skeptical about the need. Without
Cal-Fed, the state's water future would be management by lawsuit and
politics.</TE>
<TE>   The divisions are reflected in competing bills in Congress, SB
1768 by Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-Calif.) and
HR 3208 by Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   The preferable Feinstein-Boxer measure is a simple reauthorization
that ratifies a Cal-Fed agreement of August 2000. Calvert's bill
undercuts the plan by guaranteeing supplies to some farmers and
authorizing reservoir expansion before feasibility studies are
completed--a political power play reminiscent of the old water war
years.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a costly water measure through Congress will require solid
backing from the state's delegation. Some compromise may be needed,
but the bones of the Feinstein-Boxer bill should survive. The state's
farmers should be treated fairly, but their needs should not be put
ahead of others'. Cal-Fed is about wisely using the plenty in wet
years and sharing shortages in dry. That's the way it should stay.</TE>

<HD>Saving the Education Ladder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College has been the essential ladder of economic opportunity in
America since Congress passed the G.I. Bill after World War II,
opening the doors of higher education to farmers and mechanics.</LD>
<LD>   As a study released last week by the nonprofit National Center for
Public Policy and Higher Education shows, however, many rungs on the
ladder have broken. "Only the wealthiest families have seen their
incomes keep pace with tuition," the study concluded, and "the
lowest-income families have lost the most ground."</LD>
<LD>   Last week, White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.
floated a proposal that might have made the ladder even more rickety.
Daniels suggested that Congress trim about $1.3 billion from the
$70-billion "loan consolidation program" that Washington began in
1986. That loan program allows college graduates to lock in their
loans for up to 30 years at a fixed, federally subsidized rate of
8.5% a year.</LD>
<TE>   Bush administration officials quickly retreated from Daniels'
proposal after Democrats hammered it as amounting to "more tax cuts
for Enron paid for by effectively raising taxes on middle-class
students and their families."</TE>
<TE>   Although Democratic leaders are right to stress that federal
leaders, in today's recession, should be doing more to help families
afford college, they also were too quick to dismiss Daniels'
underlying point. He had suggested trimming the loan program, after
all, not to help Enron but rather to make up for a $1.3-billion
shortfall in the Pell grant program. Unlike the loan consolidation
program, the grants are targeted sharply at low-income Americans, and
Pell underfunding is as much the fault of Democrats as Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), the chairman of the
House Education and the Workforce Committee, sensibly asked the
General Accounting Office to begin studying which Americans are
benefiting the most from the loan consolidation program: the needy
ones whom the center's study found to be losing ground or Stanford
Law graduates making more than $100,000 a year. It's a fair question
that Daniels was right to raise.</TE>
<TE>   Until that study comes in, however, Congress should be careful to
protect a loan program that encourages Americans to seek higher
education. Such government foresight was critical after World War II.
Today, when a highly skilled work force has become the key to helping
lift the United States out of recession, low-interest student loans
have become essential.</TE>

<LD>Should a candidate for judge be allowed to tell voters which
political party he or she belongs to? Do we want would-be judges to
promise voters, for example, that they will invoke the death penalty
every chance they get? The U.S. Supreme Court soon will decide what
many legal experts see as a knotty case with big implications for
ensuring fair trials.</LD>
<LD>   The specific dispute centers on the constitutionality of
Minnesota's "announce" rule, a part of that state's canons of
judicial ethics that bars a candidate from commenting on cases,
issues or controversies that could come before him or her as a judge.
This rule is intended to prevent a would-be judge from committing to
an ideological position before even hearing any testimony.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Wersal, a lawyer who lost a 1998 bid for the Minnesota
Supreme Court, brought this challenge. Wersal wanted voters to know
he would decide cases based on a literal interpretation of the state
constitution and sought the endorsement of the Minnesota Republican
Party.</LD>
<TE>   The Minnesota state bar's ethics rules prohibit party endorsements
and statements by a candidate as to how he would decide on specific
issues. Minnesota's rule is similar to ethical canons that limit the
behavior of judicial candidates in the 30 states, including
California, where voters elect all or most of their judges.
Candidates can generally tout their qualifications for the bench and
past accomplishments, but little else.</TE>
<TE>   When the justices heard arguments in the Minnesota case in March,
several seemed inclined to loosen the muzzle these canons placed on
judges. But if they do, a cornerstone of the court system will be
compromised and campaigns for the bench could well turn into ugly
contests over which candidate promises to throw the most criminals in
the slammer. Judges have a unique role in our democracy. We don't
elect them to be advocates for an issue or position; that's the role
of officials such as legislators, governors and the president.
Rather, we select judges specifically not to be beholden to any
particular viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly many judges do their work harboring their own biases,
just like the rest of us. But we expect judges to set aside those
views and consider only the facts and the law in each case.</TE>
<TE>   When a judge announces on the campaign trail that he will throw
the book at every accused rapist or drunk driver, what is the
likelihood that people accused of those crimes in his courtroom will
get a fair trial?</TE>
<TE>   It is jarring to think of an election campaign in which the
candidates cannot tell voters much about what they think. The only
thing worse would be judicial candidates who told us how they would
rule on every issue. That would be more than jarring--that would be a
frightening blow to judicial independence.</TE>

<LD>Re "Clinton Said to Want TV Talk Show," May 2: Bill Clinton as an
NBC-TV talk show host? I think it's a great idea, but I just hope
reports that Clinton is looking for $50 million are wrong. As great
as his political skills are, he is an amateur as the next David Frost
or Larry King, and he should be happy to get such an opportunity at a
bargain rate.</LD>
<LD>   I'd love to see "Bubba" go toe to toe with the likes of
conservative pundits like Rush Limbaugh, Matt Drudge and all the
Fox-TV motor-mouth nitwits. He can't help but drive them up the wall
with his liberal philosophy, his racial sensitivity and his
compassionate (if somewhat hypocritical) view of less-fortunate
Americans who struggle just to survive.</LD>
<LD>   Words of advice for the would-be Charlie Rose: Get serious and
don't fudge the truth. If you can't do this, you shouldn't consider a
career in TV.</LD>

No, the template should be the old Dean Martin Show, complete with
Gold Diggers (think sexy interns) and boozy old cronies chatting it
up between ribald sketches. Only in 2002, they'll talk politics, not

as much as $15 million a year" and in the quote describing Clinton's

<LD>You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand the problems of
communities south of the Ventura Boulevard corridor ("Residents Fight
a Flood of Commuters," April 28). Paving the five unpaved miles of
Mulholland Drive above Encino that prevent commuters from traveling a
more direct route to their destinations would eliminate the vast
majority of the undesirable neighborhood traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the right of way is now part of the Santa Monica
Mountains parkland, we should be able to have a beautiful scenic
drive, available to all, to help eliminate the congestion problem.
This would create better access for all of us to the Santa Monica
Mountains and be a great additional family-outing destination.</LD>

<LD>While we should certainly worry about any racist making it to the
second round of a national election ("Far-Rightist Le Pen Is Mighty
in France," April 22), we should at least commend the French for
holding their runoff two weeks after the primary. In California, we
have to wait an insufferable eight months for the Bill Simon-Gray

<LD>Re "Can Gays Be Good Priests?" Commentary, May 2: Could Douglas Kmiec
actually believe that homosexuality within the priesthood is a larger
issue than child sexual abuse? If that's the prevailing view, then no
wonder the church has been shaken to its core. It has been estimated
that the priesthood may be up to 40% gay, but no one has suggested
that 40% are child molesters. As for whether gays can be good
priests, ask the firemen who carried Father Mychal Judge's body from
the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The only issue larger than child sexual abuse is the church's
inability to understand that when it comes to human sexuality, a
celibate priesthood, having removed itself from the practice of human
sexuality, has no business handing out the rules. In doing so, it
continues to leave a trail of psychologically wrecked followers
behind.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Greenfield</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Can gays be good priests?" Of course they can. God loves all his
children regardless of their sexual orientation. I think the correct
question would be, can priests be good human beings? Not all
homosexual priests would molest a child or commit a sexual act with
another person. Not all heterosexual priests would molest a child or
commit a sexual act with another person. Homosexuals are just like
heterosexuals. The Catholic Church requires priests to refrain from
sexual activity for God. So any priest, whether homosexual or
heterosexual, would be restrained from that.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Cardinals Look Out for No. 1 in Scandal," by Steve Lopez, May
3: Mr. Lopez, you purport to be in the Catholic family, or have been.
Were you absent when they taught the creed of faith? (Take your pick:
the Apostles' Creed for children, Athanasian/Neapolitan or the
Nicene.) In none of them is an article of faith to be found that
says: "I believe in the cardinal . . . I believe in the bishop . . .
I believe in the priests." To this black Catholic, the church is
us--the people, not those stewards wearing the red and scarlet hats.
Thus, the faith still stands. There is no crisis in what we know or
profess to believe, and everyone remains accountable for all they do.
There was a class called "sin." Did you miss it? So if it appears
that clergy are getting away, they aren't.</TE>

<HD>'Moral Violence' Is an Oxymoron</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I hope the barbarity of Dennis Prager's paean to violence will shock
future generations less inclined to consider the intentional killing
of human beings a "moral good" (Commentary, May 2). In the meantime,
I can only remind readers that those pacifists whom Prager calls
liars and who he says "cannot be taken seriously on a moral basis"
include Gandhi, King, Einstein, Jesus and Buddha.</LD>
<LD>   It is Prager who loses his moral compass while celebrating the
short-term, pyrrhic victories of warfare. Rather than chastise those
parents who discourage young boys from indulging their appetites for
violence on TV, Prager would do well to consider carefully the words
of someone who thought long and hard about the morality of war: "I
object to violence," Gandhi wrote, "because when it appears to do
good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent."</LD>

James Pinkerton, in his economic evaluation of George the younger,
casually ignores the recently forecasted doubling of the debt in this

the disastrous economic policy of George the elder that left us mired

<LD>These days I feel like Rip Van Winkle rousing from a long sleep to
find a completely unfamiliar country. The newspapers speak of the
president not only threatening war but actually--with the assistance
of the American military--plotting the best way of destroying a
regime (Iraq) that he doesn't like. I remember a country that was
supposedly peace-loving, a country where only the Congress could
declare war, where the president's fits of pique were modified and
mollified by more rational individuals. Today the voices of dissent
are still.</LD>
<LD>   Where are the so-called liberals who once, in the past, would have
railed against this usurpation of congressional power and
prerogative? Where are the young protesters, the ones who will make
up the army (and the dead) of the 100,000 to 200,000 the military
estimates it will need for its Iraqi invasion? Have the lessons of
Vietnam escaped them? Where are the prayerful who are always asking
for divine assistance? Have they given up on even praying for peace?
Where will it all end?</LD>
<LD>   After Iraq there's still Libya and Moammar Kadafi. How about
Somalia? When we finish with the easy ones, how about Pakistan?
(There are more Islamic militants in Pakistan than anywhere.) Will we
eventually get around to those "reds" in China? I think I'll go back
to sleep. Perhaps while I'm sleeping some of those liberals will
develop backbones.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The photo of angry demonstrators seeking (demanding) rights for
illegal immigrants is next to "Major Cuts in County Health Care
Foreseen" (May 2), on the L.A. County health-care system having to
slash $688 million over three years. L.A. County's health department
acknowledges that up to 3 million uninsured people already rely on
free county care, and Kathryn Barger, the chief of staff for
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, stated, regarding the budget cut, that
"we have to make sure it's not compromising the quality . . . of
care."</LD>
<LD>   Wouldn't one way to cut costs without cutting care be to treat
fewer patients? If (when) these illegal aliens get their "rights,"
who is going to pay for their health care? If they contribute "so
much to the economy," as immigrant activists claim, certainly their
employers will pay for their health care or they will purchase it
themselves, right?</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Konschuh</LD>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why should tax dollars be appropriated for illegal rights? This is
a major concern overlooked by labor leaders, community activists and
thousands of people. When immigrants are documented legally, as
required by the law, rights are included.</TE>
<TE>   Frances Williams</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, but certainly perplexing, The Times decided to
devote prominent space in the newspaper on protests over
anti-immigrant French presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen in
Paris ("1 Million Marchers Take to Streets of France to Protest
Against Le Pen," May 2) yet barely covered a similar protest against
immigrant bashing here in Los Angeles that actually marched right by
The Times' building on Spring Street.</TE>
<TE>   Is it because the editors would rather speak to the concerns and
issues across the Atlantic rather than a story about the clamor for
justice happening just outside its door? Wake up and realize that

<TE>   Re "Suspect Named in Slaying of Sheriff's Deputy" and "Kidnap
Suspect Fled to Mexico, Authorities Say," May 2: So The Times reports
on just one day that a cop killer and a kidnapper have both escaped
to Mexico. How many times a year does this happen? We know that our
political leadership is much too busy pandering to the Latino vote to
make an issue of this travesty.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I understand that Gov. Gray Davis may not have the time
to address the matter of illegals slinking back across the border to
avoid justice because he is too busy trying to get them a California
driver's license so they can legally drive to jobs that it is illegal
for them to have. But at least now, when they race back home after
committing crimes in California, they can do so as safe, licensed
drivers.</TE>

<HD>Hugo Banzer, 75; Bolivian Dictator Turned President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hugo Banzer Suarez, the general who ruled Bolivia as an ironfisted
dictator in the 1970s and returned from exile and ignominy a
generation later to become the democratically elected president, died
of a heart attack Sunday. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time ruler died surrounded by his family in Santa Cruz, a
tropical city in eastern Bolivia, hours after waking up in pain
around midnight, said his doctor, Freddy Terrazas.</LD>
<LD>   Banzer had long suffered from lung cancer, an illness that forced
him to step down as president in August. In his emotional resignation
speech, he offered words of apology and reconciliation to the victims
of his dictatorship.</LD>
<TE>   "To my political adversaries, those from before and those from
today, who believe they were hurt, and to those I may have injured
without meaning to, I offer my extended hand," Banzer said in Sucre,
one of the nation's two capitals.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the number of people who disappeared, were tortured
or killed during the seven years Banzer ruled Bolivia in the 1970s
range from 200 to 1,000. Tens of thousands of Bolivians were exiled
during that time, which saw a boom in the Andean nation's cocaine
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer's political ascendancy was intertwined with the drama and
farce of Bolivian politics during one of its worst periods of
instability, an era when a succession of coups and counter-coups
brought military men to power.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the generals ruled for months, weeks or hours. Banzer
proved more resilient than most, though his early reign marked the
beginning of the end of military control of the government.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a well-off family of German descent--his grandfather,
Georg Banzer, immigrated to Bolivia at the end of the 19th
century--Banzer was born May 10, 1926, in Concepcion, a northeastern
town in the tropical lowlands.</TE>
<TE>   After being accepted to military school at age 14 and receiving
several military scholarships, Banzer rose quickly through the ranks
of the Bolivian army. He trained with the U.S. armed forces at Ft.
Hood, Texas, and in the Panama Canal Zone. He became a colonel at 35.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Banzer held a number of high posts, including
minister of education, in the regime of Air Force Gen. Rene
Barrientos, a childhood friend who ruled Bolivia from 1964 until his
death in a helicopter crash in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1970, Banzer was a member of a military junta that took
power for just six hours before being ousted in a counter-coup by a
leftist general, Juan Jose Torres. Banzer remained in the army and
led another coup just three months later. It failed. He then went
into exile, fleeing to Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months later, Banzer slipped back into Bolivia and seized
power in another coup; the country has seen some 190 in its history.
Dozens of people were killed in the violent uprising.</TE>
<TE>   As president, Banzer moved quickly to suppress opposition,
ordering the detention of labor and peasant leaders and suspending
civil rights. "Those who were deprived of their freedom or life were
not saints, they were not little angels," Banzer said several years
later. "They tried to alter the established order."</TE>
<TE>   Banzer's coup allegedly was backed by the nation's cocaine barons,
then growing in power and influence. During his dictatorship,
high-ranking members of the Bolivian armed forces reputedly grew rich
off the cocaine trade.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, his rule saw a period of unprecedented growth in
the Bolivian economy, fueled by the rise in world mineral prices and
the expansion of economic infrastructure and social programs.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer drew Bolivia closer to dictatorships in neighboring
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay, though he would later deny
being part of "Operation Condor," a shadowy alliance of right-wing
intelligence agencies that sought to eliminate leftists in South
America.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, under pressure from President Carter, Banzer announced
that Bolivia would hold elections the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer's handpicked candidate, Gen. Juan Pereda Asbun, won amid
widespread allegations of electoral fraud. With opposition parties
demanding new elections, Banzer resigned before his term ended. More
coups, counter-coups and caretaker governments followed.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer would dedicate most of his remaining political career to
returning to power through legal means, founding the Nationalist
Democratic Action party in 1979. That year he ran for president,
finishing third with just 13% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   As Bolivia slipped further into political chaos, Banzer remained a
powerful figure. He was a symbol of past stability as the nation was
ravaged by a five-figure inflation rate and a seemingly unending
series of strikes and demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Exiled by a military regime in 1981, he returned to Bolivia the
following year, when the country returned to democratic rule.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Banzer won 28% of the vote, a narrow plurality, in the
presidential election. But he lost out when the election fell to
Congress, where a center-left coalition brought Victor Paz Estenssoro
to power.</TE>
<TE>   After two more failed attempts, Banzer finally won election in
1997, thanks to an unlikely "mega-coalition" with leftist and
populist parties. Banzer recast himself as a centrist reformer. He
created a post of human rights ombudsman and revised criminal
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   His crackdown on coca, the crop used in cocaine production, won
support from the U.S. government and some Bolivians, but also led to
widespread unrest in rural Bolivia.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said his stated commitment to take Bolivia out of the
South American cocaine circuit by this year would damage the economy
and foster human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   But despite whatever reforms he offered, Banzer could not escape
his past. An Argentine judge sought his extradition on charges that,
during his 1970s dictatorship, the Bolivian government had conspired
with other South American military regimes to eliminate political
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer denied the charges and his attorney general rejected the
extradition request in January.</TE>
<TE>   Although Banzer, a cigarette smoker, had undergone chemotherapy
treatments last year at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington, D.C., his family feared he would be extradited if he
traveled to the United States for additional cancer treatment this
year.</TE>
<TE>   With his lung cancer having spread to his brain, Banzer announced
in February that he would spend his last days in Santa Cruz, near his
birthplace.</TE>
<TE>   Banzer's funeral is scheduled today in Santa Cruz.</TE>

<HD>Public Defenders Say Judge in Sentencing Furor Justified</HD>
<DH>Courts: Attorneys call $100 fine and probation proper for
Orange County man who burned 5-year-old son's hand as punishment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Orange County public defender's office have risen to
the defense of a judge who reduced charges against a father accused
of burning his 5-year-old son's hand over a gas flame.</LD>
<LD>   Several attorneys said Orange County Superior Court Judge James O.
Perez has been unfairly criticized for reducing the charges against
the father from a felony that could have brought six years in prison
to a misdemeanor resulting in no jail time and a $100 fine.</LD>
<LD>   The father, a Guatemalan immigrant, said he burned his son's hand
after discovering that the boy stole a pack of gum. The father said
his mother had disciplined him the same way during his childhood in
Guatemala.</LD>
<TE>   Over the stern objections of a prosecutor, Perez decided to reduce
the charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. He argued that "customs
and habits" reflecting cultural differences played a role in his
decision, along with the fact that the father was making an earnest
effort to discipline his son.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was criticized for his decision by the prosecutor as well as
child abuse experts. But members of the public defender's office said
this week that Perez made the proper decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this is a case where the judge thought the father was
not sadistic but someone who disciplined a child in a way we all
thought was inappropriate," said Assistant Public Defender Denise
Gragg.</TE>
<TE>   The case has provided fodder for radio talk show hosts in recent
days, prompting public defenders to speak out in favor of the judge's
decision. Deputy Public Defender Jamalyn Ollinger said the important
issue is that the father is remorseful and cooperating with social
workers, who suggested that he attend parenting classes. He will also
receive counseling as part of probation, Ollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a social worker and probation officer that are monitoring
him.... It's not like he gets a $100 fine and he's gone," the
attorney said. "This will ensure he never harms another child. I
personally am certain he will never reoffend. He really does
understand his behavior was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Schatzle, the prosecutor in the case,
said that once the judge reduced the charge to a misdemeanor she
requested a probation sentence because she was certain he would not
impose jail time. "That case resolved exactly how the judge
intended," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Schatzle had argued against reducing the charge to a misdemeanor,
asking the judge, "At what point does a burning of a child's hand
become a felony?"</TE>
<TE>   Wellington Soto, 36, was arrested in January after he admitted to
Anaheim police that he burned his son's hand on a gas stove after he
caught him shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said he believed the father had good intentions, teaching
his child a lesson, but went about it the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   "We find ourselves in the crosscurrent of customs and habits," the
judge said during the April 23 sentencing hearing in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The decision outraged child abuse prevention advocates, who
contended that courts are often more lenient on violence committed
against family members than violence against strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "By the judge making that determination, he really sided with the
father and left this child even more of a victim," said Chris Monaco,
director of the Childhelp USA national child abuse hotline. "So, what
has this child learned? 'My dad can do this to me and get away with
it.'"</TE>

<HD>The Oracle Debacle Coulda, Shoulda Been Prevented</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Coulda, shoulda: If Gov. Gray Davis' Cabinet minions had heeded
his incessant lecturing, they would have avoided the state's
embarrassing software scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' lecture goes like this: When somebody says you must act
now, that's when you freeze.</LD>
<TE>   Beware. Be skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy puts it: "If somebody comes
to you and says, 'I need something and it has to be right now,' the
answer is 'No.'</TE>
<TE>   "Where I failed was, I broke the cardinal rule."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy added the final, crucial signature on a "governor's action
request" (GAR) that gave the green light for the apparently
overpriced software contract with Oracle Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Also signing the go-ahead document were the secretary of the
Consumer Services Agency and the directors of Planning and Research,
Finance, General Services and Information Technology.</TE>
<TE>   The GAR was presented to Kennedy last May 31. The other officials
already had signed, all that day. The first paragraph should have set
off alarm bells for any Davis appointee. It read:</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunity described below expires May 31, 2001. The offer
is contingent upon receipt of an order prior to Oracle's May 31
fiscal year-end. Oracle must report fiscal year profits to
shareholders ... and is therefore motivated for a very limited time
to offer the aggressive pricing . . . which would save the state an
estimated $111million conservatively over the next 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   The three-page memo concluded with the same tone of urgency,
emphasizing "the short window of opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Act now, this offer expires at midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The state fell for it and immediately signed the six-year,
$95-million contract. Kennedy says she assumed all the advertised
benefits had been checked out--or would be--by the other GAR
signatories. They weren't.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it turns out, Logicon Inc. helped write the GAR memo.
The company is a reseller of Oracle software--packaging it in
computer systems--and worked both sides on this deal. Maybe
illegally, says state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who is investigating.
"Seems on its face to be a conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Logicon was hired by the state as a consultant on software
purchases and wound up pitching the Oracle contract. Later, the state
learned Logicon stood to make $28million on the deal because of a
side agreement with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Oracle and Logicon have offered to tear up the
state contract. Davis has asked Lockyer to work out details. That
might let taxpayers off the hook, but not Davis entirely. He's still
tarnished by his underlings' screw-up.</TE>
<TE>   Based on volume-discount buying, Oracle-Logicon projected six-year
savings of $16 million for the state; $111 million if it bought an
optional four-year extension. Not even close, contends state Auditor
Elaine M. Howle. She pegged state losses at $41 million for six years
and $6 million for 10.</TE>
<TE>   The seller's rosy projections don't hold up, Howle says, because
there's very little market in the bureaucracy for new software. The
Department of Information Technology, which promoted the deal,
couldn't find much interest. But DOIT Director Elias Cortez
apparently hid this fact from other Davis decision-makers. The state
overbought and overpaid.</TE>
<TE>   In her report ripping the contract last month, Howle asserted that
the state's naive negotiators were no match for Oracle's "high
pressure sales tactics." They didn't understand, she said, that
Oracle is well-known for just this pitch: "Prices are going up; it's
the fourth quarter and we are ready to deal."</TE>
<TE>   Coulda, shoulda--did: The governor has rolled heads in the last 10
days.</TE>
<TE>   He suspended Director Cortez after suspicious shredding was
reported at DOIT. He sacked General Services Director Barry Keene,
the overseer of state contracts.</TE>
<TE>   He dumped eGovernment Director Arun Baheti after learning that the
former Democratic operative had delivered a $25,000 campaign check
from Oracle around the time of the contract signing. That violated
Davis' rule against state employees dabbling in his fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   So Davis gets points for moving quickly after this stink bomb
exploded, but his overall image still takes another beating.</TE>
<TE>   Shoulda--didn't: What happened to the nagging nit-picker, the
micro-manager, the governor who wouldn't delegate?</TE>
<TE>   "I micro-manage what's on my plate," Davis replied Friday. "There
are transactions every day....They don't require my personal
knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   But what good is a nit-picking governor if a $95-million, no-bid
contract isn't even on his plate? Gray Davis could have avoided this
scandal by being more like, well, Gray Davis.</TE>

<HD>Lawns Become a Growing Concern</HD>
<DH>Planning: San Jose expects to pass a law requiring that
yards be landscaped and RVs be hidden, sparking a property-rights
debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Kathy Allen is trying to sell her million-dollar home here. But she
is so worried that her neighbor's overgrown yards will scare off
potential buyers, she is paying a gardener to care for two of the
properties.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders feel her pain, and are poised to pass a sweeping
public nuisance ordinance that would require property owners in San
Jose to landscape their yards and keep recreational vehicles mostly
hidden from sight--or face fines of up to $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   Allen says such enforcement is exactly what her city needs. But
the proposed rules, expected to pass on second reading May 28, have
sparked a lively debate about property rights and the definition of
blight.</LD>
<TE>   "The real estate agent told me it's an eyesore," said Allen, who
spoke on the condition that her neighborhood not be identified.
"We're trying to sell our home for $1.2 million, but if they see five
homes in a row on this block that aren't mowed, no one is going to
pay a million anything."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed guidelines, owners of single-family homes would
have to landscape frontyards and sideyards that are visible from a
street or public right of way, using either live plants or decorative
material such as rocks, bark or gravel. Bare dirt would be
unacceptable, and so would weeds. Recreational vehicles, boats,
campers and trailers could not be parked "in an area visible from any
street" for longer than 72 consecutive hours.</TE>
<TE>   City workers would not comb the streets looking for weedy lawns or
motor homes parked in driveways, but if neighbors complained, the
city would respond.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make it possible for people to live in great
neighborhoods in San Jose," said Mayor Ron Gonzales. "I don't know
that we're going to reach a conclusion that makes everyone happy, but
I know it's important to the people."</TE>
<TE>   Residents who can't afford to meet the minimum landscaping
requirements or who are physically unable to do so can get help from
city programs and neighborhood associations.</TE>
<TE>   City planners met with about 50 neighborhood associations to
develop the new guidelines, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed landscaping regulations drew little public outcry at
a recent City Council meeting where they were discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Recreational vehicle owners, however, said the rules about where
they can park their boats and campers infringe on their property
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a small RV, and I have it parked in my driveway," said
retiree Glen Sutherlin, who has kept such vehicles since 1971 without
incident. "It does not stick out on the sidewalk, and it does not
bother anybody. My neighbors have not complained."</TE>
<TE>   Sutherlin said his RV simply will not fit in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "I own this piece of property, and I should be able to do what I
want to on that property. If I'm not impeding the foot traffic in
front of my house, it's not my problem," Sutherlin said.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled a similar attempt to legislate RV parking on private
property about 20 years ago in San Jose. That effort fell flat. "They
had such a crowd at the City Council that they could not even get
everyone in the room, and the plan got shelved," Sutherlin said. He
hopes for the same result this time around.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose Councilman Chuck Reed cast the only dissenting vote last
week, but said he would support the new rules if they are made more
specific. The way the ordinance is written now, he said, "if you had
a little rowboat in your driveway, that would be prohibited. But if
you had a 20-foot [sport utility vehicle] that was rusted out and
looked like hell, that would be allowed," Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   The rules would not be unique to San Jose. Many towns regulate RV
parking and some require a measure of landscaping in the frontyard.
But the specific definitions of landscaping make the proposed
regulations in San Jose more stringent than most on the books.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange County city of Brea, for example, there are rules
requiring frontyards to be maintained and kept free and clear of
trash, inoperable vehicles and debris. But it's left up to the
individual to determine what kind of ground cover is appropriate,
said Brea city planner David Crabtree.</TE>
<TE>   That city takes a tiered approach to controlling RV parking: If
possible, the code states, it's preferable for the vehicles to be
stored in a garage or backyard, out of view. If there is no room,
they can be stored in the side or rear yard, 25 feet behind the
property line. If that fails, an RV may be parked in the driveway as
long as it doesn't extend onto the sidewalk or obstruct the view of
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The world's largest RV owners club, the Good Sam Club, has helped
RV owners in dozens of communities resist attempts to outlaw the
storage of such vehicles on private property--with measured success.</TE>
<TE>   "These laws are so complicated," said Bob Livingston, associate
publisher of Trailer Life and Motor Home magazines, which are
affiliated with the Good Sam Club. "We don't feel there's any problem
parking an RV on your own property."</TE>
<TE>   An example, said Livingston, is the city of Ventura, where his
magazines are published. "In this city, you can't have an RV parked
on the street between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., but you can have it
out there on the weekends.... We try to fight the laws that don't make
any sense. Unfortunately, we lost this one," he said.</TE>

<HD>Lou Thesz, 86; Former World Champion Wrestler</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What you see on TV today is not ... wrestling. That is choreographed
tumbling. That is not wrestling. It's not even related to wrestling."</LD>
<LD>   --Lou Thesz</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Lou Thesz, a professional wrestler who actually wrestled and was a
champion at it for more than three decades, has died. He was 86.</TE>
<TE>   Thesz died April 28 in Winter Park, Fla., of complications from
open heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Professional wrestling in the late 1940s and '50s was a big draw
and became a staple of early television. There was a good bit of show
business in the sport--the horror movie star Bela Lugosi, a fellow
Hungarian, was once a celebrity corner man for Thesz--and many of the
wrestlers wore gorgeous, or gaudy, robes and monocles, had flowing
hair and created stage personas that emulated European nobility.</TE>
<TE>   But not Thesz, described in a Times article in 1952 as "a rarity
in the ranks" and the "prophet of straight wrestling."</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't braid his hair, throw arsenic to the customers, grind
his teeth on a buzz saw, train on celery stalks and tear gas, or wear
purple trunks scalloped with dollar signs," the article stated.</TE>
<TE>   A rock-solid 6 feet, 2 inches and 220 pounds, Thesz stayed in
spectacular shape well into his 70s through a regimen of
weightlifting, swimming and skiing. In a 55-year career, he held the
world-champion title six different times.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the wrestlers of Thesz's heyday had backgrounds as
amateurs and knew how to execute basic moves and holds. Thesz became
a master of "hooks," a collection of submissive holds that could
temporarily cripple his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "Hookers in wrestling means we inflicted pain," he told the
Seattle Times some years ago. "We could twist arms and wrists enough
to break them. When I was learning to wrestle, my trainer told me
that if I didn't hurt my opponent, they wouldn't remember my name."</TE>
<TE>   The arm twisting and leg bending would send opponents to the mat,
where Thesz would pin them. Matches were usually the best-of-three
falls for a win.</TE>
<TE>   "When Lou Thesz wrestled in the '40s, you needed to know how to
wrestle, and you needed enough charisma to draw crowds. Lou had
both," said Mike Chapman, the executive director of the International
Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   In major cities across the country, top attractions such as Thesz
would draw as many as 10,000 fans for an event. At the height of his
career, Thesz would be in 200 to 250 matches a year.</TE>
<TE>   According to press accounts at the time, Thesz was one of the
top-paid athletes in the early 1950s, making as much as $250,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   One of his biggest matches came in Los Angeles in May 1952, when
he was pitted against Baron Michele Leone of Venice Beach for the
World Heavyweight Title.</TE>
<TE>   The event, at an outdoor venue called Gilmore Field at Fairfax
Avenue and Beverly Boulevard, drew 25,000 spectators, turned away
thousands more and grossed $103,000.</TE>
<TE>   Thesz took the match in two out of three falls and was the toast
of the town.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next three decades, Thesz made a steady living on the
mat. He was a favorite in Japan, making 30 trips there over the years
to compete and to teach wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   Born Aloysius Martin Lou Thesz, he grew up in St. Louis and
learned Greco-Roman wrestling from his father, who was an amateur
champion in his native Hungary.</TE>
<TE>   Thesz dropped out of school at 14 to work in his father's shoe
shop and to concentrate on wrestling. At 16, he made his debut in
East St. Louis, Ill. He lost the match, but within two years he
competed for the Midwest Wrestling Assn. world crown, defeating
Everett Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Thesz's last match took place in Japan in 1990. He was 74 and
weighed 215 pounds. His opponent was 27 and weighed 260. Thesz lost
the match when his artificial hip buckled.</TE>
<TE>   "I was old enough to know not to do it," Thesz told the
Virginian-Pilot newspaper, "but I did it anyway."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mariana Yampolsky, 76, a photographer known for her pictures of
Mexico's Indian population, died Friday in Mexico City of an internal
hemorrhage caused by a cancerous tumor.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Chicago to a Russian father and German mother, she earned
a bachelor's degree in arts and humanities from the University of
Chicago. In 1944, she moved to Mexico to study at the La Esmeralda
school of painting and sculpture.</LD>
<LD>   Yampolsky became interested in photography while working as an
engraver at the Graphica Popular studio, founded in Mexico in the
1940s by artists who produced for the masses.</LD>
<TE>   Her photos, found in museums around the world, often featured the
daily life of Mexico's Indians. She dismissed criticism for not
expanding into other themes, and often said: "If you love a people, a
country, you also love everything about being human."</TE>

<HD>Livingston Biddle, 83; Wrote Bill Creating U.S. Arts
Agency, Later Led It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Livingston L. Biddle Jr., 83, who helped write legislation creating
the National Endowment for the Arts and was named by President Jimmy
Carter to head the agency from 1977 to 1981, died Friday at Sibley
Hospital in Washington, D.C. He had been in ill health for some time,
but no cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., Biddle came from a long line of wealthy
and influential ancestors. His great-great-grandfather, Nicholas
Biddle, founded the Second Bank of the United States. Another
relative, Francis Biddle, was attorney general under President
Franklin D. Roosevelt and was chief judge at the Nuremberg Nazi
trials.</LD>
<LD>   As an aide to Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), Biddle drafted the
legislation that in 1965 established the National Endowment for the
Humanities and the National Council on the Arts. Biddle was a
lifelong advocate of excellence in the arts and of government funding
to make the arts accessible to the population at large in small towns
and rural areas, as well as in urban art centers.</LD>
<TE>   Biddle often lamented the threat posed to the agency after
congressional conservatives discovered in 1989 that endowment funds
were used to support an exhibition by the late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and
pictures of nude children.</TE>

<HD>Ivy Browne, 87; Famed for 1934 Swim Across San Francisco
Bay</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ivy Browne, 87, who gained national attention in 1934 for swimming
from San Francisco to Oakland, died Tuesday in Reno, Nev., of
leukemia.</LD>
<LD>   Browne was 19 when she swam across San Francisco Bay on a dare.
The swim made headlines, and her photo was published in Life
magazine. Her record of 2 hours, 6 minutes stood for 46 years.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed the Unsinkable Ivy Browne by San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen, she swam in open water competitive events off
Hawaii, New Zealand and Santa Cruz, Calif. She held a world record of
4 hours, 19 minutes in the 10-kilometer races.</LD>
<TE>   Browne abandoned swimming for 40 years after moving to Lake Tahoe
in 1942 to look after the homes of wealthy summer residents. But at
age 65, she moved to Reno and renewed her interest in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   She won countless medals in the Senior Olympics in recent years,
and in 1995 and 1996 was national open-water swimming champion in the
80-to-84 age group. At 82, she became the first woman to swim across
Lake Mead.</TE>

<HD>Antoine Riboud, 83; Founded Firm Making Dannon, Evian
Products</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antoine Riboud, 83, the founder of Groupe Danone SA who transformed a
small glassworks operation into the world's biggest maker of dairy
products and bottled water, died Sunday in Paris of unstated causes.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Lyons, France, Riboud began his career in 1942 with a
maker of glass bottles and jars, Verreries Souchon-Neuvesel, which
owned 25% of the Evian mineral-water company. In 1966, he merged
Verreries and Boussois, a maker of window glass, but he failed two
years later in France's first hostile takeover bid for another
competitor, Cie Saint-Gobain SA.</LD>
<LD>   Focusing on content rather than containers, Riboud in 1970
acquired two breweries and gained control of Evian and its baby-food
subsidiaries. In 1973, he merged with Gervais Danone, France's
largest food company specializing in cream cheese, yogurt and
desserts. He went on to add Dannon United States in 1981, Europe's
Generale Biscuit in 1986 and the European units of Nabisco in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   The company changed its name to Danone in 1994, and Riboud
resigned as chairman in 1996, turning over control to his son, Franck
Riboud. Last year, the company boasted some 100,000 employees in more
than 120 countries and sales of $13.3 billion.</TE>

<HD>Offbeat Issues Fill the Bills in Senate</HD>
<DH>Capitol: Measures deal with yuletide tree, UC parking
ticket quotas and Pledge of Allegiance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Californians, here is a taste of what the state Senate did for you
last week:</LD>
<LD>   * Voted to decree that the state's official tree of the Christmas
season be known as the "Capitol Christmas Tree" instead of the
"holiday tree." Sen. William "Pete" Knight (R-Palmdale) said calling
it the holiday tree "dishonors a beloved Christian symbol in the name
of inclusiveness."</LD>
<LD>   * Unanimously passed a bill that prohibits the University of
California from denying promotions to parking enforcement employees
if they fail to write a minimum quota of parking tickets. Such
punitive practices are against the law for city and state parking
workers, but a loophole allows them at UC.</LD>
<TE>   * Approved a bill requiring public school children to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance as part of daily patriotic exercises. Students
or school employees who object could remain seated and not be subject
to "discipline, retaliation or ostracism."</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who wrote the Pledge bill, SB 1248, as well as the
Christmas tree legislation, said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11
left Americans "desperate to express their patriotic feelings." He
said his bill would help fill the void, especially for children who
had never learned the Pledge. On a 24-4 vote, the bill was approved
and forwarded to the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Knight said he had complained several times to Gov. Gray Davis
about the practice in government publications of citing the
traditional Capitol Park yuletide tree as the holiday tree. The
governor ignored his complaints, Knight said. But he found plenty of
support in the Senate, which unanimously approved the bill, SB 1577,
and sent it to the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) said his bill for
meter readers and other parking enforcers at UC campuses was aimed at
putting an end to the practice of UC officials who, he said, pressure
employees to write "50 to 60 tickets a day."</TE>
<TE>   Burton noted that ticket quotas long have been illegal for state
and local law enforcement departments, as is denying a promotion to a
worker who fails to issue a certain number of tickets.</TE>
<TE>   His bill, SB 2069, sponsored by the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, also would discourage parking
enforcers from issuing unnecessary citations, proponents said. It
went to the Assembly on a 32-0 vote without debate.</TE>

<LD>A Navy helicopter based at Coronado crashed and sank in the Pacific
Ocean about 87 miles off San Diego during a training exercise, but
all three personnel were rescued, officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred as the SH-60 helicopter from North Island
Naval Air Station was attempting to land on the guided-missile
destroyer Paul Hamilton at 9:38 p.m. Saturday. The Hamilton is part
of the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group now training for
deployment to the Arabian Sea.</LD>
<LD>   The three crew members were rescued by sailors from the Hamilton.
An investigation into the crash is underway, officials said.</LD>

<HD>Shards of Glass Found at Mission Viejo Park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County sheriff's deputies found pieces of broken glass near a
playground slide at a Mission Viejo park Sunday, the fourth time in
the last 10 days that someone has targeted a local park with sharp,
hazardous objects. No one was injured, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears [the glass] was intentionally placed at the bottom of
a slide and on the steps," said Lt. Tom Gallivan of the Sheriff's
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Crucero Park is in the middle of a residential area off Marguerite
Parkway several blocks north of Lake Mission Viejo.</LD>
<TE>   The shards were found about 1:50 p.m. by a reserve deputy
searching the area.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, park crews and deputies equipped with metal detectors
swept through dozens of playgrounds in the area as a safety
precaution. The investigation also has led authorities to hardware
stores and home-improvement centers, where officers suspect the razor
blades and nails found buried in playgrounds at various public parks
were purchased.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of razor blade incidents occurred a year ago at six
parks in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. Police never caught the
culprit and the discoveries ended in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday morning, Laguna Beach police received an anonymous
call from a young woman warning that some friends were going to do
something at Main Beach to "hurt people." Authorities later found 17
razor blades partially buried in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a man, who was with his 18-month-old daughter,
discovered razors and nails at a small park in the Marina Hills
community of Laguna Niguel. Landscaping crews discovered 17
construction nails hidden around a park in Mission Viejo on Friday.</TE>

<LD>Maybe it has all been a fib. The arthritic big toe and the organ
damage caused by the pills he takes to deal with it. The injury he
suffered playing Spider-Man with the kids. The cut finger that sent
him to the trainer's room for what seemed like half of Game 1 of the
Western Conference semifinals, and the phone call he says he received
from his father that caused him to head back out to the court. What's
truth and what's fiction?</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to Shaquille O'Neal, believe what you see for
yourself. On Sunday what you saw was example No. 8,453 of why O'Neal
is the biggest, baddest, most dominant force in basketball.</LD>
<LD>   The toe that threatened to trip the Lakers' season hasn't been an
issue lately. In these playoffs the Toe That Consumed L.A. has proven
to be stronger than David Robinson's back and Jamal Mashburn's
stomach.</LD>
<TE>   And when the Lakers needed O'Neal most--with Kobe Bryant hurting
because of a bruised knee and shots clanging off the rim from all
over the place--he was there, scoring 13 points in the final nine
minutes as they finally caught and passed the San Antonio Spurs in
this basketball equivalent of a low-speed chase.</TE>
<TE>   He did it with four stitches in his left forearm from an accident
he had Sunday morning. Laker Coach Phil Jackson said it was the
result of "the gremlin in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he saw the movie "Spider-Man" on Friday night and he
was trying to imitate Peter Parker's wall-crawling ways while
climbing above the bathroom sink. O'Neal, who normally casts himself
as Superman, slipped and cut himself on some glass.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happens when you cross superheroes," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   At least he got the whole saving-the-day part right later on.</TE>
<TE>   First he cut his finger on the rim while blocking a Tim Duncan
shot about three minutes into the third quarter. He went back into
the trainer's room, where doctors numbed his hand and gave him three
stitches. He was there for the rest of the third quarter and wasn't
seen again until one minute into the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not know what they were doing, whether they were amputating
his finger or what was going on in the locker room," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he got the impetus to return when his father called
the phone line in the Lakers' training room.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to get my [butt] back out there," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the same thing over and over again, to every reporter with
a notepad and television microphone that came his way. At least he
was consistent with his story, even if it didn't quite check out.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Laker trainer Gary Vitti if he heard the phone ring back
there, and a quizzical look crossed his face. Then I explained Shaq's
story to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds good to me," Vitti said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been known to embellish a story, to toss the media an
anecdote too good to pass up. Usually he means it all in fun, but
there might have been an early Father's Day tribute behind this tale.
Even if Philip Harrison didn't actually call, O'Neal surely could
hear his voice telling him to get back, and he has had reason to
appreciate everything Harrison did for him.</TE>
<TE>   "My condolences go out to Tim Duncan, who just lost his father
[last week]," O'Neal said. "I know how important it is for a father.
Me and my father are real close."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal talked briefly with Duncan before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him sorry," O'Neal said. "I'm sure it's hard for him. It
just shows you what type of man his father was, [because] Tim Duncan
has always been a class act. I was just telling him how well he was
raised by good people."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe sympathy kept O'Neal from inflicting more damage on Duncan
early on, but that all changed when he returned in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal missed his first couple of shots, then made a turnaround
jumper. He took off after a missed shot, caught a Rick Fox pass ahead
of the pack and threw down a two-handed dunk.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed offensive rebounds. He even made five of six free
throws in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to my guys, 'Just get me the ball and let me go for what I
know,'" O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys weren't really hitting their shots that well. I just wanted
to get it and take the high-percentage shots."</TE>
<TE>   And he was so fired up that he almost obliterated Mark Madsen with
a chest-bump as he came to the bench for a Spur timeout after he made
a basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I'm alive after that chest-bump," said Madsen, who
simply wanted to give O'Neal a high-five. "That was more than just a
chest-bump. That was like me trying to stand in front of a locomotive
going 35 miles an hour."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's explanation of his hyperactivity was: "I had to do
something else, because I couldn't feel my finger. I just had to take
my mind off playing with nine fingers."</TE>
<TE>   Madsen, having survived his brush with O'Neal, was filled with
admiration.</TE>
<TE>   "He had stitches on top of his finger, right where the ball sits,
where he shoots it off of," Madsen said. "He still wanted the ball
inside, he was still making his free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one Shaq. That's what makes him special. I don't
care if he could barely walk. He'd be out there, calling for the
ball, making plays, involving his teammates."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal finished with 23 points, 17 rebounds and four blocked
shots. There has been a lot of talk about Duncan versus Jason Kidd
for the NBA most-valuable-player award. You'd have a hard time
convincing the Lakers that anybody could be more valuable than O'Neal
was in the fourth quarter of this 86-80 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exactly what we needed at that point in the game," guard
Brian Shaw said. "We were playing real flat and sluggish, and he
infused us with some energy when he came back in the arena."</TE>
<TE>   It was on his way out of the arena that O'Neal finally came close
to 'fessing up. When asked one more time if the training-room call
really happened, he winked and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Marketing, baby," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I knew that story was a little too good. In all honesty, so was
Shaq.</TE>

<LD>There wasn't a raucous celebration in Seattle's clubhouse Sunday at
Yankee Stadium as players milled around the lunch table while the
music remained at a normal decibel level.</LD>
<LD>   That's not the usual reaction from a visiting team that has just
swept the New York Yankees. Then again, the Mariners know that
nothing counts in this rivalry until October.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a message," reliever Jeff Nelson said after the 10-6
victory. "This is the regular season. The postseason is different."</LD>
<TE>   The sweep gave the Mariners their 11th victory in their last 12
regular-season games at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   But New York ended Seattle's last two seasons in the American
League championship series. The Mariners won't come back this season
unless the teams meet in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We beat them up pretty good in the regular season last year, and
they got us back in the postseason," second baseman Bret Boone said.
"We're not putting too much into this. To get to where we want to be,
which is the World Series, we will have to beat these guys."</TE>
<TE>   They did that Sunday with Ruben Sierra homering and driving in
four runs and Joel Pineiro shutting down the Yankees for six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Williams homered twice for the Yankees, who were swept for
the first time this season. They fell 41/2 games behind Boston in the
American League East, New York's largest deficit since September
1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still early," Williams said. "We've got to start winning
some games obviously, but we can't be worried about what other teams
are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro (2-0) gave up two runs and five hits in six innings to get
his first win as a starter this season. Ichiro Suzuki scored three
runs and Jeff Cirillo went three for four with two RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners jumped on David Wells (4-1) early and kept up their
amazing play away from Safeco Field.</TE>
<TE>   They are 14-2 on the road this season and 73-24 since the start of
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a work in progress. The guys just go about their
business and win games," said Cirillo, who joined Seattle in the
off-season. "We just swept the Yankees in Yankee Stadium and there
wasn't jubilation."</TE>
<TE>   One day after rallying from a 5-0 deficit to win, the Mariners
played from ahead most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Suzuki led off with an infield single and went to third when Boone
hit a drive to deep center that glanced off Williams' glove for a
double.</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud's groundout made it 1-0--the only first-inning run
yielded by Wells in seven starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 2, Tampa Bay 0--The Red Sox won for the fifth time in a row
and improved their record to 20-7, the best in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo gave up three hits in eight innings and Jose
Offerman hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Offerman's sacrifice fly off Steve Kent drove in Trot Nixon, who
doubled off Ryan Rupe (3-3). Nomar Garciaparra added a solo homer off
Esteban Yan in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays have lost 10 in a row, their longest streak since
Sept. 9-20, 2000, and one short of the club record set from June
30-July 13, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Rupe, 0-4 in five starts against Boston last season, had limited
the Red Sox to two singles by Johnny Damon through seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   He retired 13 in a row after hitting Shea Hillenbrand with a pitch
that loaded the bases with two outs in the first.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Minnesota 6--Jeff Weaver won in the Metrodome for the
first time as the Tigers ended the Twins' 10-game home winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Fick and Wendell Magee each hit two-run homers during a
five-run fifth inning that gave Detroit a 7-1 lead. The Tigers
survived a late rally to record only the second victory in their last
15 games at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver (2-4) gave up four runs and six hits in six-plus innings to
beat the Twins for only the third time in 10 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver was 0-2 with a 9.54 earned-run average in three previous
Metrodome starts and 2-6, 6.66 lifetime against the Twins. Juan
Acevedo got the final five outs for his second save, working around a
double by Corey Koskie in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 3, Chicago 2--Barry Zito combined with Jim Mecir and Billy
Koch on a six-hitter at Comiskey Park and the Athletics avoided being
swept in the three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox, who were swept in three games by Oakland last
weekend, outscored the Athletics, 18-6, in this series after being
outscored, 32-5, at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (2-2), who gave up six runs and six hits in four innings at
New York in his last start, yielded two runs and six hits in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Texas 2--Omar Vizquel had five hits in five at-bats
and drove in two runs and C.C. Sabathia won for the first time in
four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Ranger starter Kenny Rogers (3-1), who entered with the AL's
second-lowest ERA, gave up 10 hits and six runs in four innings in
the loss at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Vizquel singled in his first two at-bats and doubled in his next
three for the Indians, who got a season-high 16 hits and won for the
fourth time in 19 games. It was Vizquel's second five-hit game, his
first since July 18, 1991, when he was with Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 3, Kansas City 2--The Orioles, who trailed, 2-0, before
rallying in the sixth inning, had never swept a four-game series at
home against the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore finished 7-0 against Kansas City this season, outscoring
the Royals, 55-16.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Conine homered and Mike Bordick added a run-scoring single
during a three-run sixth. Michael Tucker homered for Kansas City, 0-6
since interim Manager John Mizerock replaced Tony Muser on Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Ortiz Takes Command as Angels Win Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>As a young pitcher --well, OK, a not-so-young pitcher --Ramon Ortiz
appears blissfully unaware of the Angels' postseason history. For the
last 15 years, after all, the Angels have no postseason history.</LD>
<LD>   However, should the Angels advance to the playoffs, Ortiz is
making his case to start Game 1. He utterly dominated the Toronto
Blue Jays in an 8-2 victory Sunday, pitching a five-hitter and tying
a career high with 10 strikeouts.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to pitch in the playoffs in Anaheim," he said. "I want to
pitch in the World Series one day in Anaheim. I want to feel like
Pedro and Clemens.</LD>
<TE>   "This year? You never know."</TE>
<TE>   For the ninth time in 10 games, the Angels won. They scored in
each of the first five innings, with David Eckstein and Darin Erstad
driving in two runs apiece, then sat back and applauded as Ortiz
carried his shutout into the ninth inning. He got the first two out,
then gave up consecutive home runs to Jose Cruz Jr. and Carlos
Delgado.</TE>
<TE>   "With two outs, I said, oh my gosh, a shutout," Ortiz said. "But
you never know in baseball. Two pitches, two home runs. It's OK. I'm
happy. Two runs, nine innings, a complete game? I'm very happy."</TE>
<TE>   The day was his, from the first inning to the last. He retired 19
of 20 from the third inning into the ninth. He walked none.</TE>
<TE>   His earned-run average of 2.44 ranks fourth in the American
League, and opponents are batting .219 against him. In his last three
starts, he has given up three runs. But he deflected any talk of a
potential All-Star game invitation toward team goals, another
indication of maturity evident to all in the Angel clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   A couple years ago, he was "Little Pedro," the young Dominican
fireballer who once beat his idol, Pedro Martinez. But the
"potential" card had worn thin, especially after government visa
checks this year revealed him to be 29, not 26.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing," Jarrod Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "He got a little older, and he got a little better.</TE>
<TE>   "All the age jokes aside, he's definitely gotten older and wiser.
He's always had great stuff, but he's definitely figuring out how to
use it. He's done it.</TE>
<TE>   "The comparisons to Pedro? He's finally starting to show he's
worthy of those comparisons."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed all of half an hour to end any suspense about
which team would win, knocking out former Dodger prospect Luke
Prokopec in the second inning. But Ortiz's quest for a shutout
remained alive, and with it plenty of suspense.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz led off the seventh inning with a triple. The Blue Jays had
three outs at their disposal, with Cruz 90 feet away from touching
home plate to end the shutout.</TE>
<TE>   He never got there. Ortiz kicked it into overdrive, mixing 94-mph
fastballs and 86-mph curves and striking out Delgado, Raul Mondesi
and Darrin Fletcher in order.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single pitch, he made it good," catcher Bengie Molina said.
"I don't remember him missing a pitch or missing a location there."</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, after Cruz went deep to end the shutout and Delgado
went deep too, Molina visited the mound to remind Ortiz to settle
down.</TE>
<TE>   Molina is justifiably proud of his years of work with Ortiz,
encouraging his friend not to get rattled during a game, not to let
one error get him down or let one hit turn into three. Molina has
done that job so well that he, not Ortiz, was the one visibly
aggravated about the loss of the shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted it so bad," he told one of the Angel coaches in the
clubhouse after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "With two outs in the ninth, of course you want to get the
shutout," Molina said later. "One more pitch, and you get the
shutout. It's too bad he didn't get it. I feel bad."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz did not, perhaps the best sign of the day for the Angels. He
has pitched the Angels' last four complete games, two this year and
two last year. His first shutout will come someday, and he is not
anxious about it.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so calm out there now," Molina said, "he calms me down
sometimes."</TE>

<HD>Team Turns Into the Go-Go Angels</HD>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>It's a little too soon for the Edison Field souvenir store to start
selling T-shirts commemorating the Go-Go Angels, but the Angels are
running wild in running to victory. The Angels did not hit a home run
in Sunday's victory, but they stole two bases. They rank third in the
American League in stolen bases and third-to-last in home runs, yet
no one on the roster has stolen 30 bases in a season.</LD>
<LD>   "We're definitely going to push the envelope," Manager Mike
Scioscia said, "and steal as many bases as we can without running
into mindless outs."</LD>
<LD>   When the Angels start hitting home runs, Scioscia might back off.
In his first year as manager, they had nearly three times as many
homers as steals.</LD>
<TE>   For now, Scioscia preaches stolen bases, hit-and-run plays and
taking the extra base, and not just among the usual suspects: Catcher
Bengie Molina is the slowest runner on the team, but he was on first
base when Scioscia called a hit-and-run. The batter grounded out, but
the Angels avoided the double play, and Molina later scored.</TE>
<TE>   No one has an absolute green light to run, Scioscia said, but
seven players have stolen at least one base. Designated hitter Brad
Fullmer, who stole five bases for Toronto last season, stole his
fourth of the season Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time I've really had a chance to get stolen
bases," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it. If you're aggressive on the bases, it puts a little
more pressure on the defense. And the pitchers can't just throw junk
up there. They have to throw more fastballs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The streets of Toronto were abuzz late Saturday night, with
drivers honking car horns and pedestrians waving team flags in
celebration of the Maple Leafs' triple-overtime victory in the
Stanley Cup playoffs. Several Angel players attended the game, with
pitchers Jarrod Washburn and Lou Pote staying until the thrilling
end.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my first playoff hockey game, and in Canada," Washburn
said. "It was a great atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's memories will not be quite as fond. He got stuck in an
elevator at the team hotel for two hours in the early evening, in
part because the repairman was caught in downtown traffic headed for
the hockey game.</TE>
<TE>   "We were rationing breathing because we didn't know how much air
was left," Scioscia joked.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Terry Smith and bullpen catcher Orlando Mercado were
among the nine people stranded in the elevator, including tourists
from the Canadian province of Newfoundland who were so nice Scioscia
left them tickets for Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Molina had three hits, raising his batting average to .327. Brian
Downing set the franchise record for batting average by a catcher,
hitting .326 for the 1979 division champions.... The Angels won five
of six games on their trip. Their 9-6 road record is third-best in
the league, trailing only the Seattle Mariners (14-2) and Boston Red
Sox (12-2).</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Lance Berkman doesn't feel comfortable at the plate, not that anyone
can tell.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes the swing is there. Sometimes it's not," he said Sunday
after homering twice to tie Sammy Sosa for the major league lead at
13 and help the Houston Astros defeat the New York Mets, 12-1.</LD>
<LD>   Berkman, who hit .331 last year, went three for five with five
RBIs, moving his average above .300 for the first time this season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's kind of frustrating," he said. "It's just been peaks and
valleys this year. I just want to be consistent, and that hasn't been
the case. I'm tinkering with my stance and swing all the time. I went
up there with five different approaches today and I only felt
comfortable twice."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman hit a run-scoring double in the first inning, then had a
solo homer off Satoru Komiyama in the sixth and a three-run homer off
Scott Strickland in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman had his second multihomer game this season and the ninth
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Check with me in September and we'll see who's still up there,"
he said. "I'm not anything like [Barry] Bonds or Sosa."</TE>
<TE>   He batted .435 (10 for 23) on the homestand. "He's a great
hitter," Al Leiter said. "And he's going to get better. It's not a
surprise. We stop on his name and talk about him extensively when
we're going through the scouting report."</TE>
<TE>   Leiter (3-2)--in the worst of his seven starts this season--gave
up five runs (four earned), five hits, two walks and a hit batter in
four innings. His earned-run average rose from 0.92 to 1.67. Leiter
dropped to 2-6 with a 5.37 ERA against the Astros, 0-4 since Sept.
15, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Houston starter Roy Oswalt, hitless in 13 at-bats this season
entering the game, doubled to lead off the third inning and hit a
three-run single in the fifth--a bases-loaded blooper that bounced
off the glove of second baseman Joe McEwing into the face of center
fielder Jay Payton, then rolled away.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody called for it," McEwing said. "I had a good bead on it and
should have caught it. It hit the top of my glove."</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (4-1) combined with Nelson Cruz and Brandon Puffer on a
four-hitter. After a shaky first two innings, Oswalt settled down and
retired 16 of the next 17 hitters before being lifted for a
pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. He didn't give up an earned run
while striking out seven and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros scored the most runs against the Mets this season.</TE>

<HD>Reese Returns to Second for Pirates</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pittsburgh Pirates activated second baseman Pokey Reese from the
15-day disabled list Sunday and scratched left-hander Dave Williams
from his scheduled start against the San Diego Padres.</LD>
<LD>   Reese, who went 0 for 3, had been sidelined since April 20 because
of a strained right hamstring. To make room on the roster, the
Pirates put right-hander Josias Manzanillo, who has a bone chip in
his right elbow, on the 15-day disabled list. Manzanillo had made one
appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Reliever Sean Lowe made the start--his first this season--in place
of Williams, who was hit on the right shin by a batted ball in his
last start, a 10-0 loss at Colorado on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who gave up seven hits and eight runs in 31/3 innings at
Colorado, is expected to be sidelined for only one start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Juan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers, sidelined since
April 11 because of torn muscle fibers between the thumb and index
finger of his right hand, will see hand specialist Dr. Bobby Wroten
today at Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who has played in only seven games, still can't swing a
bat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Diamondbacks purchased the contract of right-hander
Erik Sabel from Tucson, their triple-A affilliate in the Pacific
Coast League, and assigned infielder Danny Klassen to Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   The move was made to bolster a bullpen depleted by extensive use
in recent games. The Diamondbacks used all six relievers in a 6-5,
11-inning victory over Montreal on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives us another serviceable arm," Manager Bob Brenly said.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Jose Parra, recalled from Tucson early last week,
pitched in his fifth consecutive game without giving up a run
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Byung-Hyun has pitched in five consecutive games, the first
time he has done it in his major league career.</TE>
<TE>   Klassen was activated from the 15-day disabled list Friday and
cleared waivers that day. He had a pinch-hit single Saturday night in
the only at-bat of his brief stint.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee starter Jamey Wright, who has been on the disabled list
since April 11 because of tendinitis in his right shoulder, will go
to triple-A Indianapolis of the International League for a
rehabilitation assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Wright's first outing will be Thursday against Pawtucket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland outfielder Brady Anderson was scratched from the
starting lineup for Sunday's game against Texas because of lower-back
spasms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Jason Marquis of the Atlanta Braves gave up two runs
in five innings in a rehabilitation start Saturday night for triple-A
Richmond of the International League, with six strikeouts and one
walk.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis is expected to rejoin the rotation Saturday at Atlanta.</TE>

<HD>No Love Lost for Barrera, Morales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestled in opposite corners of a crowded room, where fans,
photographers, members of the media, assorted hangers-on and
strolling mariachis all angled for position, Marco Antonio Barrera
and Erik Morales glared at each other whenever possible.</LD>
<LD>   The two featherweight fighters were assembled at a Mexican
restaurant in Industry on Sunday to promote their June 22 rematch in
Las Vegas before heading to the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area to
address an estimated crowd of 70,000 celebrating Cinco de Mayo.</LD>
<LD>   They purposely were kept apart, lest they reenact the blows they
threw at each other the last time they shared the dais, during their
winter press tour. After Morales was awarded a split decision on Feb.
19, 2000, the two engaged in a nasty war of words that was fueled by
Barrera pulling out of the originally scheduled rematch March 2
because of a rib injury.</LD>
<TE>   Barrera (54-3, 39 knockouts), a law school-educated son of Mexico
City, referred to Morales as dumb and uneducated. Morales (41-0, 31
KOs), from the border town of Tijuana, used a slang term to question
Barrera's manhood.</TE>
<TE>   And while the rhetoric was a bit toned down Sunday, the animosity
between the two was evident. After all, the fight has many cultural
implications in their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   "Something's wrong with him," Barrera said of Morales. "Maybe he's
got bad advice. The way he talks, the way he expresses himself, it's
like he studies what he says, like he's told what to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people don't respect him because he talks too much. He
talks out of character and doesn't give his opponents respect. Before
fighting me, he called out my mother a bunch of times. That's a lack
of respect."</TE>
<TE>   It was a reverse of field for Barrera from last week, though, when
he praised Morales' ring skills in the Mexican press. The seemingly
contrived adoration only served to upset Morales.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need him to tell me what I already know--that I have a
great heart, that I can do all these great things," said Morales, the
World Boxing Council champion. "Everybody already knows these things
and I'll show it again in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "He's finally seeing the reality of it and he knows I'm not an
easy fight. He knows I'm not going to be a day at the park."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An announcement is expected to be made this week that Staples
Center will be the site of the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Jose Luis
Castillo rematch Aug. 10. In the April 20 fight that many believed
Castillo won, Mayweather was awarded a unanimous decision in Las
Vegas.</TE>

<HD>A Ming Dynasty at Point for Warriors?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Quandary: The Warriors
say they need a true point guard but they're fascinated by 7-foot-5
Yao Ming. His post play is suspect, but he can handle.</LD>
<LD>   "If the Warriors get the No. 1 pick, which way to go? Solution:
Draft Yao, play him at the point."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Ostler: "The most exciting moment of the Yao workout run by
P.J. Carlesimo came afterward, when Ming was eating lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "Carlesimo overheard Ming say that his hot dog was too bland. So
P.J. suggested, 'Put some mustard on it,' and Ming choked him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the Laker single-game leader in playoff
field-goal percentage?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bitter: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "The list of
[Warrior owner] Chris Cohan's failings would fill this column, but
failing to get Jerry West is the topper.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big Chris Mullin fan, but as Garry St. Jean and Dave
Twardzik have proved, this isn't a job for a first-timer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a deal! The New York Knicks, who failed to reach the playoffs
for the first time in 15 seasons, decided not to raise ticket prices
after raising them every year since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Director Spike Lee, who paid $131,000 for two courtside seats at
Madison Square Garden this season, told the New York Daily News:
"That's great. Now I can send my kid to college."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thankful even now: Bob Molinaro of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot
asked former major league pitcher Chuck Stobbs, 73, about the titanic
homer Mickey Mantle hit off him, which sailed over the roof at
Washington's old Griffith Stadium in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   The 565-foot shot was one of the longest home runs recorded. Said
Stobbs: "I'm just glad he didn't hit it back at me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Road worrier: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Mike Hampton had
a nice outing the other day [at Coors Field] against the Pirates, but
we'll let you know when he's out of the woods. Fact: In three starts
on the road, he has allowed opposing hitters a .424 average. To put
that number in perspective, Rogers Hornsby hit .424 in 1924, the
highest batting average in baseball history."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Hampton allowed six runs and eight hits in six
innings Sunday in a 7-4 loss at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He flunks history: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News:
"After his Hawaii training camp, the scholar [Mike] Tyson lectured
reporters on Niccolo Machiavelli, no less: 'He's way ahead of his
time. I think he's the most sophisticated writer since Shakespeare.'</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon, Prof. Tyson, but Mr. Machiavelli preceded Mr.
Shakespeare. But only by a century."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1940, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the
first National League team to travel by air, flying in two planes
from St. Louis to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain, 1.000 (nine for nine), against
Atlanta on April 17, 1969.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rick Morrissey in the Chicago Tribune: "Yao Ming is
going to be a force in the NBA. And the Bulls should choose him if
the lottery balls bounce their way.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Cartwright can teach Yao the Tao of the paint, and Jerry
Krause, international man of mystery, can take credit for Yao's very
existence."</TE>

<HD>Capistrano Valley Is No Sure Thing</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After back-to-back Southern Section Division I
championships, eight new starters make for tougher bid this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rites of spring in Southern California: smog levels surge, surfers
take to the beach and the Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley High
Cougars win a baseball title.</LD>
<LD>   At least that's the way it has been the last two years, when
Capistrano Valley went undefeated after spring break to win
back-to-back Southern Section Division I baseball championships at
Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Cougars could go on to win a third consecutive title this
season, but they will have taken a vastly different path to get
there. An group of transfers and junior varsity players has struggled
to replace eight starters, four of whom went on to the Division I
college level.</LD>
<TE>   "They've been loaded the last two years, and those players
definitely did what they were supposed to do," Mission Viejo Coach
Chris Ashbach said of his South Coast League rival. "These new kids
are all young and they're coming from different places."</TE>
<TE>   After going a combined 24-0 after spring break in 2000 and 2001,
Capistrano Valley has won only four of eight games after spring break
this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars needed a two-game sweep of Lake Forest El Toro last
week just to get back into the playoff race. With two games to go,
Capistrano Valley (14-10 overall and 7-6 in the South Coast League)
is tied with Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills for third place, one game
behind Mission Viejo and two games behind league leader Dana Point
Dana Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars, who finish the regular season this week with two
games against Dana Hills, could finish anywhere from first in league
to fourth and out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're in line to do what we did the last couple of
years," said Capistrano Valley Coach Bob Zamora, always the optimist.
"We're starting to round into form. If we could put together a six-
or seven-game wining streak, we'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   That will be tough for a team whose longest winning streak this
season has been four. The Cougars have gone 5-6 in one-run games,
including three one-run losses to Mission Viejo. "That's the mark of
a young club," Zamora said. "A veteran club wins those games."</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were high for Capistrano Valley this season even
though the team lost key players such as left-hander Frank
McLaughlin, who accomplished an exceptional feat by winning
back-to-back starts in section championship games.</TE>
<TE>   The only returning stars were hard-throwing closer Jason Corder
and smooth-fielding shortstop Adam Sorgi. Corder was moved to the
starting rotation and has excelled with a 5-3 record, 2.29 earned-run
average and 72 strikeouts and 58 innings. The sophomore right-hander
has been even more impressive at the plate, where he has hit .487
with six home runs and 23 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Sorgi hasn't been as productive after jamming his right shoulder
while diving into first base before the season. He is hitting .225.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries have been a constant nuisance for the Cougars, as more
than three-quarters of the starting lineup has been sidelined by an
assortment of sprained ankles and broken fingers. Capistrano Valley
blended its returning players with six transfers--four from Rancho
Santa Margarita--and a host of junior varsity players. Two transfers,
pitcher Gavin Fabian and third baseman Gary Gattis, have been
reunited with three Cougars they played with on the South Mission
Viejo team that reached the Little League World Series in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really comfortable playing with them," Sorgi said. "I know
their moves."</TE>
<TE>   Among the transfers, outfielder Jeremy Burchett has led the way by
hitting .329 with four home runs and 16 RBIs. Gattis has shown
glimpses of power, though he has played in only the last 10 games
because of a back injury. And Fabian is batting .328 with several
clutch hits.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [the lack of consistency] has been a matter of us
not gelling together, we just need to get some breaks," Fabian said.
"The whole team hasn't been hot as a whole. It's the last team that
gets hot that wins. We're going to get hot last."</TE>

<HD>Battle Could Be Brewing Over War Emblem</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: First owner of Kentucky Derby winner is
seeking a larger share of $1-million bonus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Russell Reineman, the original owner of War Emblem, suggested Sunday
that he might be entitled to more than a 10% share of the $1-million
bonus that the colt earned after winning Saturday's Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Although Reineman was left with only 10% of War Emblem after he
sold the rest of the horse to Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia for
$900,000 on April 11, he was the sole owner of the colt when he won
the Illinois Derby at Sportsman's Park five days before. The bonus,
which will be paid by an insurance policy taken out by Sportsman's
Park, was offered to any horse that could win the Illinois Derby and
only one of the Triple Crown races--the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness
and the Belmont Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know that the new owner should get [$900,000 of the
bonus]," Reineman said from his home in Oak Brook, Ill. "I'm going to
talk with him. War Emblem won the first race [of the bonus] for me,
and he couldn't have gotten the bonus without doing that. I don't
know what the rules are, but I'd like to find out."</LD>
<TE>   Terry Hart, vice president of horse racing operations at
Sportsman's Park, said that the bonus rules do not address the
ownership question.</TE>
<TE>   "All the rules say," Hart said, "is that the horse earns the bonus
if he wins both races."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bob Baffert, who saddled War Emblem for the first time to
win his third Derby and seventh Triple Crown race out of the last 17
run, said after the race that he would be splitting his 10% of the
bonus with Frank "Bobby" Springer, who trained the colt for four
victories in seven starts before Reineman sold him. Springer probably
would receive $55,000--$45,000 from Baffert and $10,000 as his 10%
share of Reineman's $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "That guy told me everything about the horse," Baffert said.
"Which is not always the case when a guy loses a horse to another
trainer. The horse has a nasty personality. He likes his space and
you can't mess with him. It was easy to take over training him after
what [Springer] told me."</TE>
<TE>   Reineman said that there was no presale agreement regarding the
bonus. Baffert said that Reineman, who didn't attend the Derby, has
been invited to the Preakness at Pimlico on May 18, when War Emblem
will try to win the second leg of the Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to Mr. Reineman," Baffert said. "The bonus won't be
an issue. The split [90% for Salman, 10% for Reineman] was
straightened out when the horse was sold."</TE>
<TE>   Different jockeys also accounted for the victories in the bonus
races, Larry Sterling riding in the Illinois Derby and Victor
Espinoza on Saturday. Sterling sought to ride War Emblem in the
Kentucky Derby, but Baffert preferred Espinoza, a rising star in
Southern California, even though Baffert replaced him with Jerry
Bailey aboard Congaree for last year's Preakness after a third-place
finish in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   A jockey also is supposed to receive 10% of a bonus--the same
share as the regular race purse--although historically that's not
always guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Risen Star, winner of the Preakness and the Belmont,
earned a $1-million Triple Crown bonus for accruing the most points
through high finishes in the series. Louie Roussel, co-owner and
trainer of Risen Star, said his jockey, Eddie Delahoussaye, was
entitled to 10% of the race purses and not a piece of the bonus.
Delahoussaye persisted, and with support from the Jockeys' Guild, was
finally paid his $100,000 share of the bonus.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Spend A Buck earned a $2-million Garden State Park bonus
by winning four races, three at Garden State and the Kentucky Derby.
Angel Cordero rode Spend A Buck in the first three races, including
the Kentucky Derby, but because of a conflict at Belmont Park was
unable to ride the colt in the final race, the Jersey Derby. Laffit
Pincay rode in the Jersey Derby and was paid $200,000 for the jockey
share of the bonus. Cordero believed that Dennis Diaz, the owner of
Spend A Buck, or Pincay should reward him for his contributions, but
he received nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman's name was not listed in Saturday's Churchill Downs
program as the minority owner of War Emblem. Only Salman's name and
the name of his racing stable, Thoroughbred Corp., were listed.</TE>
<TE>   "That was part of the agreement when the horse was sold, that he
run in [Thoroughbred Corp.'s] name," Reineman said.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 17 other starters in the Derby were listed with
multiple owners. Bernie Hettel, the chief Kentucky state steward,
could not be reached for comment regarding the omission of Reineman's
name.</TE>
<TE>   Reineman, 84, said Sunday that he sold War Emblem because he
needed the money to stay in racing. He has owned Crown Steel Sales in
Chicago since buying out his brother's interest in 1955, and has
raced horses since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   "The steel business has been terrible lately," Reineman said.
"We've had two bad years. And the racing stable hasn't done much in
those two years, either. We've been losing money. I might have had to
get out of the game if I hadn't sold this horse."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, who ran the ninth fastest Derby time, 2:01 for 11/4
miles, would not have run in the Derby if he hadn't been sold.
Baffert liked the colt because he had beaten Repent, a leading Derby
contender, in the Illinois Derby. Reineman and Springer liked the
idea of having more time between races, and before Salman's offer
were pointing for the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got mixed emotions about the horse winning the Derby," said
Reineman, whose only Derby starter, Wise Times, ran ninth in 1986.
"It would have been nice to have owned him myself. But I don't know
that he beat much. I never saw a worse bunch of horses."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Wayne Lukas, who finished second with Proud Citizen in the
Kentucky Derby, said that a stablemate, Table Limit, would join that
colt in the Preakness against War Emblem. Few from the Derby are
expected to move on to Pimlico, but a capacity field of 14 is still
possible. Other possible Derby participants for the Preakness are
Medaglia d'Oro (fourth Saturday) and Harlan's Holiday (seventh).
Others who could run are Booklet, Sunday Break, U S S Tinosa, Crimson
Hero, Straight Gin, Equality, Magic Weisner, Marasca and Stephentown,
who won the race after the Derby.... Saarland, 10th in the Derby, was
to have surgery Sunday to remove a chip in his left front ankle.</TE>

<HD>Offense Sputters in 3-0 Dodger Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have enough trouble scoring runs when they do string
together hits, as evidenced by a four-game stretch from Wednesday
through Saturday in which they had 41 hits but scratched out only
nine runs.</LD>
<LD>   When they're not hitting, the Dodgers have virtually no chance, as
evidenced by their 3-0 loss to the Chicago Cubs on Sunday night, when
the Dodgers managed four measly singles before a sellout crowd of
52,758 in Dodger Stadium and lost for the fourth time in six games on
the homestand.</LD>
<LD>   Five Cub pitchers, including starter Matt Clement, combined to
hand the Dodgers their major league-leading sixth shutout.</LD>
<TE>   Only one Dodger reached second base, when Shawn Green's
fourth-inning grounder went under first baseman Fred McGriff's legs
for a two-base error.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers began the game with a league-leading .265 average, but
that mark fell to .260 Sunday night. They rank 11th in runs, 15th in
home runs, 15th in walks, and first in double plays grounded into.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan was hitless in 20 at-bats before his
sixth-inning single Sunday and is batting .248. Shortstop Cesar
Izturis has five hits in 32 at-bats, his average dropping from .284
to .250 in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Green had six hits in his previous three games but went 0 for 4
Sunday. The cleanup batter is hitting .246 with three homers and 18
runs batted in, which his far off his 2001 pace, when he had 49 home
runs and 125 RBIs. The Dodgers have three home runs in their last 12
games.</TE>
<TE>   But Manager Jim Tracy refuses to panic.</TE>
<TE>   "To start thinking about overhauling the lineup, that's the wrong
thing to do," Tracy said. "If it was one specific guy, maybe I'd
juggle things here or there. But I don't know that that's a very good
message to send to a group of guys who have a history of getting it
done offensively.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no need to beat a dead horse or point fingers. We know
the element that we have to add to our game to be productive.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot more we can do, but right now, the offense is not
there."</TE>
<TE>   The defense, which ranks second in the league in fielding
percentage, and the pitching--the Dodgers have the league's
second-lowest earned-run average (3.00)--have been there all season,
and they were again Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers played errorless ball, and right-hander Kevin Brown
gave them a strong start, giving up three runs and six hits in seven
innings, striking out four and walking one in his second game back
from the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had good life on his fastball, good sink on his
split-fingered pitch, and his rhythm was good. His fortune, however,
was not.</TE>
<TE>   The first run Brown gave up came on a sharp-breaking, knee-high,
split-fingered fastball, which Mark Bellhorn belted over the wall in
right-center in the fourth inning. The second two runs came on
Bellhorn's broken-bat flare that fell in front of Green in right
field in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a horseshoe.... so from that standpoint, it didn't
go well," Brown (1-3) said. "That's about what it takes to get a win,
it looks like. The fact of the matter is, the pitches I gave up runs
on were good pitches. If luck is in your corner, you make those
pitches and get outs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have luck in your corner, you make those pitches and
give up hits and runs."</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-inning rally started when Brown's tailing fastball hit
Clement in the right biceps with two out. Delino DeShields singled
Clement to third, and DeShields stole second.</TE>
<TE>   Brown shattered Bellhorn's bat with a pitch, but Bellhorn got
enough of it to loop it into shallow right to score Clement and
DeShields for a 3-0 lead. The rally proved costly, though. Clement,
who did not give up a hit through four innings, departed because of a
nasty bruise on his biceps after throwing several warm-up pitches
before the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Clement was so upset he hurled his glove into the dugout wall and
knocked over a water cooler. Left-hander Ron Mahay took over to start
the fifth, and the bullpen baton was passed to Joe Borowski, Jeff
Fassero and Antonio Alfonseca, who went 11/3 innings for his fifth
save.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to leave a game when you feel so good--that's why I was
so upset," said Clement, who may miss his next start.</TE>
<TE>   "I let it out real quick, and I was fine. I'm just glad we won the
game and I'm OK."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Whatever Happened to Ishii-Mania?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six Kazuhisa Ishii starts have produced six victories but not much of
a buzz in Dodger Stadium. There was talk of Ishii-mania from the time
the Dodgers signed the Japanese left-hander on Feb. 8, but the first
five weeks of the season have produced more Ishii than mania.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Fernando-mania, when Fernando Valenzuela fueled a fan
fervor with his 8-0 start in 1981, and Nomo-mania, when fans unfurled
large Japanese banners and snapped up Nomo merchandise as quick as it
hit the shelves during Hideo Nomo's phenomenal rookie season in 1995,
Ishii has not created much of a stir.</LD>
<LD>   He has made only two starts in Dodger Stadium, including Saturday
night's 3-2 victory over the Cubs, and neither was a sellout. There
hasn't been an excessive demand for Ishii merchandise, and he hasn't
sparked the kind of passion among fans that Valenzuela and Nomo did.</LD>
<TE>   "But look at the other two guys who did that," first baseman Eric
Karros said. "One was a 20-year-old from Mexico in an area with a
huge Latin community, with that windup where he looked up to the sky,
and it just took off. Nomo was the first [Japanese player] to come to
the U.S., so there was interest all over.</TE>
<TE>   "There really isn't any novelty [to what Ishii is doing]. The guy
has had a great start, he's been a big part of the first month of the
season, but you can't compare him to Fernando and Nomo."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers weren't expecting those comparisons. At least, not
this soon.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been careful not to force-feed Ishii-mania to keep the
pressure off him," said Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' senior vice
president of communications. "But now that he's shown he can handle
the pressure, you'll see more of a marketing effort in terms of
merchandise, ticket and radio/television promotions."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii is drawing plenty of media attention. Sports Illustrated is
planning an Ishii piece, possibly a cover story, and Ishii was the
lead story on several television newscasts Saturday night, "even over
the Kentucky Derby," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a few home starts for Fernando-mania to catch on, and
even for Ichiro [Suzuki, Seattle Mariner star], it took a little time
for people to realize he was something special," Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I feel like we're at the beginning of it."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii has heard of Valenzuela, "but the extent of my knowledge of
him is seeing his picture on the outfield wall," he said through an
interpreter. "I really don't know too much about Fernando-mania."</TE>
<TE>   Could there be an Ishii-mania to rival Fernando-mania and
Nomo-mania?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so, because that's not something I can determine,"
Ishii said. "At the same time, we are just at the start of the
season. If it happens, that is something that will happen from this
point forward."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts' recent success--he is 13 for 29 with
a .568 on-base percentage in his last 10 games--pushed his on-base
percentage to .398, tops among National League leadoff batters.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger leadoff batters have combined for a .370 on-base
percentage, second in the NL behind Philadelphia, and a .292 batting
average. Dodger leadoff batters hit .268 with a .306 on-base
percentage, second worst in the league, in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   With opposing third basemen moving in to defend against the bunt,
Roberts has begun to slap more hits into left field. Shortstops have
shaded Roberts toward the hole, and pitchers have used slide-step
moves to home in hopes of slowing Roberts on the basepath.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to continue to put pressure on the defense and not let
them take away from my game," Roberts said. "If they play in, I still
have to bunt. If they slide step, I still have to run. I have to push
the envelope a little bit."</TE>

<KH>SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>And on the Seventh Day, the Lakers Played Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mad-cap recap of current events or, as it is has often been
hyperbolized, "the most exciting two minutes in sports [writing]."</LD>
<LD>   News item: Lakers finally resume play after a one-week layoff
between playoff games.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Not to suggest seven days is a long time between
center jumps, but we offer three events that were completed in less
time:</LD>
<TE>   Six-Day War (1967). Started June 5 and ended June 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Battle of Gettysburg.</TE>
<TE>   Fastest Pacific Ocean crossing. In 1973, the container ship
"Sea-Land Commerce" crossed the Pacific in 6 days 1 hour 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   What about the Moon launch? Sorry, it just missed the cut. The
Apollo 11 Mission in 1969, blast off to splash down, took 8 days 3
hours 18 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   News item: War Emblem wins Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I never tire of heart-tugging yarns about
down-on-their-luck Saudi Arabian princes who overcome adversity by
purchasing the winning horse for $900,000 three weeks before the big
race.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Kentucky Derby dubbed "the most exciting two minutes in
sports."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Not true. A recent Gallup Poll determined the most
exciting two minutes are (1) NBA analyst Bill Walton trying to
explain what he just said on the air, (2) Anna Kournikova walking off
a tennis court after a loss, (3) Dodger fans racing to their cars
after the seventh-inning stretch.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Jerry West leaves Lakers to become president of Memphis
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Do they now add claws and big ears to the NBA
logo? At $5 million a year, should West now be known as "Mr.
Clutch[bag]"?</TE>
<TE>   No joke, this is a gut-punch to middle-age men who came of
sporting age in Los Angeles. For those of us weaned before nightly
ESPN highlights and before Laker home games were televised, West was
almost a mythical figure.</TE>
<TE>   He was part player, part basketball god, part ace bandage, and
part creation of Chick Hearn's vivid radio descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   To a 12-year-old kid in 1970, West came alive on a black box
radio, with a large white, rotary tuner dial. I didn't see his
60-foot shot in Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals, but I still hear it. I
remember dancing in my parents' kitchen in the incomprehensible
moment Chick shrieked West had swished the shot; remember more the
sinking feeling that followed after New York had the gall to win the
game in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't see West finally lead the Lakers to the NBA title in
1972, but I recall flying out the front door moments after the
long-awaited victory and blaring the horn of our family station wagon
for what seemed like five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Clutch has some nerve leaving our clutches after, what, 42
years?</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who recently turned Jerry West's number, 44, all
we can do now is cling to memories.</TE>
<TE>   News item: High school squad in Florida wins national cheerleading
competition with help from nonstudent ringer from out of state.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Up the alley, down the street, who's the toughest
team to beat? The squad with that 30-year-dude from Texas, named
Pete.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mike Tyson trains in Maui for June 8 fight with Lennox
Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Highlights from recent press junket to island
include Tyson telling woman he doesn't grant interviews to female
reporters unless he has slept with them, Tyson telling reporters he'd
like to stomp on their children, Tyson admitting he bit Lewis in leg
during that news conference fracas.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Elvis has a better chance of showing up in Memphis
than this fight coming off as scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Chargers sign kick returner Tamarick Vanover, who spent
two months in jail for his role in a stolen-car case.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Vanover tells team there's no need to pick him up
at the airport. He'll find his own transportation.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Washington Redskins sign quarterback Shane Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Second item: That makes five former Florida Gators on the roster,
all part of Coach Steve Spurrier's five-point rebuilding plan that
includes trying to get Citadel on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Chinese basketball star Yao Ming jumps through hoops
for NBA scouts at Chicago workout.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: If Ming leaves his home team, the Shanghai Sharks,
will he have to turn in his little red (play) book?</TE>
<TE>   More on Ming: The Chinese government reportedly will garnish half
of Ming's NBA salary, while the Sharks also will get a significant
share.</TE>
<TE>   Also, and we're not quite sure how this happened, Don King gets a
25% cut.</TE>
<TE>   News item: ESPN wants to follow Ray Lewis with around-the-clock
camera coverage for look at the life of the Baltimore Raven All-Pro
linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Too bad ESPN didn't have cameras rolling the night
of that post-Super Bowl party in Atlanta when Lewis and associates
were "innocent" bystanders to a street brawl that left two men dead.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tony-award-winning actor Brian Dennehy phones Bob
Knight to apologize for his poor portrayal of the coach in "A Season
On The Brink."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This really happened, according to a gossip item
in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. It got us wondering about a few
other portrayals that warranted apologies.</TE>
<TE>   William Bendix to Babe Ruth ("The Babe Ruth Story").</TE>
<TE>   Tony Perkins to Jimmy Piersall ("Fear Strikes Out").</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad Ali to Muhammad Ali ("The Greatest").</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Robinson to Jackie Robinson ("The Jackie Robinson Story").</TE>
<TE>   News item: NCAA certifies three more bowl games for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: That brings the total to 28 and makes three more
bowls UCLA can turn down next year.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Notre Dame football bars cameras from filming spring
workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Any chance of extending that policy to
regular-season games?</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SAN ANTONIO VS. LAKERS GAME 1 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER:</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Considering the grim predictions that the Spurs
would prove to be nothing more than a speed bump on the Lakers'
victory parade route, Sunday's first quarter was a highlight reel for
San Antonio. When forward Bruce Bowen made a jump shot off a Tim
Duncan miss, it gave the Spurs a 10-point lead, 17-7, equaling their
biggest margin of the quarter. The only real response by the
lethargic Lakers was three Shaquille O'Neal dunks. And one of those
dunks required three tries when O'Neal missed awkwardly on the first
two.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The number of empty seats at Staples Center
at tipoff. The crowd arrived fashionably late. The lack of energy in
the stands seemed to spread to the Lakers on the court.</LD>
<TE>   Winning number: Duncan may have been dismal from the field,
missing all 10 of his attempts, but he was dazzling under the boards,
pulling in 12 of his team's 18 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Duncan was not alone in the shooting department.
Neither team could crack 30%, San Antonio making 28% of its
field-goal attempts, the Lakers even worse at 26.3%</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 6, Samaki Walker 4; Spurs--Bowen
7, Tony Parker 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Walker 5; Spurs--Duncan 12.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER:</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Just when it appeared the Lakers might slumber
through the entire first half, Bryant, a quiet 0 for 2 in the first
quarter, awoke with one of his patented moves down the lane. He
dribbled around Malik Rose only to encounter Duncan at the basket,
but never hesitated, slamming the ball home. The first roar of the
afternoon erupted from the crowd. For the Lakers, the game had
finally begun.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: It was a replay of a scene Laker fans have
been savoring for a week. Bryant drives down the lane, Robert Horry
sets himself in the right corner, Bryant spots Horry out of the
corner of his eyes, Bryant shovels off a smooth pass, Horry sets
himself behind the line, Horry shoots and ... misses. Horry's failure
to match last Sunday's series-clinching shot against the Portland
Trail Blazers was a telling comparison of how far the Lakers were
from their peak form of a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: After going 0 for 10 in the first quarter, Duncan
made five of seven in the second period to lead all scorers with 10
points.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Zero, the number of fast-break points the
out-of-sync Lakers scored.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 6, O'Neal and Devean George 4;
Spurs--Duncan 10, Steve Smith 8.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 6; Spurs--Rose 4.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER:</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Walker, suffering from a bone bruise on his left
knee, wasn't sure how much he could play Sunday. But when O'Neal
couldn't play for much of the third quarter after suffering a deep
gash in his right index finger, Walker proved a worthy substitute.
Walker began his highlight sequence with a layup before O'Neal's
exit. Then Duncan drove, only to have his shot blocked by O'Neal,
causing the gash. Duncan got the ball back and Walker blocked his
shot. Walker then accounted for the next four Laker points with two
free throws and a follow-up dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: While the Lakers and Spurs ran up and down
the floor for most of the quarter, the focal point was the tunnel
through which O'Neal had disappeared after injuring his finger. The
Lakers' biggest nightmare has been that their center's ailing toe
might act up, costing them his services in the postseason. Would it
be his finger instead? Would he come back down that tunnel? All eyes
were on it.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Three, the number of stitches it took to close
O'Neal's cut.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Also three, the number of minutes O'Neal was able to
play in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 8, Walker and Horry 6;
Spurs--Duncan, 9 Rose 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Walker and Derek Fisher 3;
Spurs--Duncan 5.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER:</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Upon O'Neal's return, Bryant went out after
getting kicked in the knee by Bowen. Bryant's return was announced as
questionable. But there was Bryant, running back into the game with
4:36 to play. And there was Bryant in his favorite spot in the
closing minute, ball in his hand, game on the line. With the Lakers
clinging to a three-point lead, Bryant dribbled into the lane with
Bowen all over him. Bryant faked a pass to his left, turned right
and, with 24.6 seconds to play, sank the turnaround jumper that
effectively put the game out of the Spurs' reach.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: It was the most dramatic moment of the game.
With 10:50 to play, O'Neal returned to the floor after getting the
gash on his finger closed. And as he trotted in to the cheers of the
crowd, he passed Bryant, hunched over on the sideline with trainer
Gary Vitti, in obvious pain from the bruise on his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: 13, the number of points O'Neal scored after
missing most of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: One, the number of rebounds Duncan was able to bring
down in a quarter in which his team totaled only eight.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 13, Bryant and Fisher 5;
Spurs--Duncan, 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Rick Fox 4; Spurs--Rose and
Antonio Daniels 2.</TE>

<DH>Owning Up to Fan Concerns, Some Try Extending Hand to Upper
Deck</DH>
<SE>FUTURE OF PRO SPORTS Second in a three-part series: A new
breed of owner is fighting the reputation of modern sports palaces as
giant billboards for sponsors and extensions of the corporate meeting
room by paying attention to the fans in the cheap seats.</SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The rookie owner of the Seattle SuperSonics spent an hour greeting
fans at the turnstiles and handing out vouchers for free hot dogs. He
signed autographs. He walked up to half a dozen ticket-holders and
surprised them with better seats.</LD>
<LD>   Howard Schultz did all of this in a casual manner, resting his
hand on their shoulders, speaking with a hint of a Brooklyn accent. A
man of the people in French cuffs.</LD>
<LD>   But as game time approached, he wanted to finish his rounds
through KeyArena and get down to courtside because, as he often says,
he's really just a fan who bought the team. The only thing standing
in his way were a father and son headed the opposite direction,
climbing toward the upper deck.</LD>
<TE>   "I love what you're doing," the father said. Then, a little
brazenly, "Can we sit with you?"</TE>
<TE>   All the tickets had been given out. Schultz was finished with
customer service for the day. Yet this scenario--a man and boy
trudging upstairs--struck at why he acquired the SuperSonics a year
ago. It also spoke to the way he became wealthy enough to do so,
taking a few coffee bars and making them feel cozy, multiplying that
formula into the omnipresent Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Holding out his hand, he said, "Let me see where you're at."</TE>
<TE>   By tipoff, Schultz was cheering from his seat while father and son
were moved to within a dozen or so rows of the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Although people in this business don't want to admit it, in most
cases professional sports have left the fan behind," Schultz said.
"So you have to look for ways to surprise people. It's just these
little things, but we're looking to touch their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Similar efforts are being made across the nation by a cadre of
owners and team executives, many of them new like Schultz and all
equally determined to refurbish sport's tarnished image.</TE>
<TE>   The industry is battling a drop in television ratings and a slip
in popularity among young fans distracted by everything from video
games to DVDs. When it comes to sluggish attendance at arenas and
stadiums, ticket prices are only part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Modern sports palaces are viewed as little more than elaborate
sound stages--the game has to be televised from somewhere. They are
seen as giant billboards for sponsors and extensions of the corporate
meeting room, filled with luxury suites where businessmen entertain
clients. The new breed of owner is fighting this reputation by paying
attention to the cheap seats.</TE>
<TE>   Every few weeks Schultz makes his rounds. In Dallas, Jerry Jones
wants to build a stadium with so-called poor man's luxury boxes.
Washington Capital owner Ted Leonsis publicizes his e-mail address
and asks fans to tell him "all the reasons you don't love this team."</TE>
<TE>   Their strategies differ, but the goal is similar: Luring people
like that father and son back to the game.</TE>
<TE>   An Abysmal Effort</TE>
<TE>   When the Sport Management Research Institute in Florida conducts
surveys at arenas and stadiums nationwide, the most common complaint
is cost.</TE>
<TE>   After years of sharp increase, the average ticket price has
recently stabilized--baseball prices rose 3.8% this season and the
NBA saw a slight decrease. Teams now set aside blocks of
less-expensive seats and offer periodic discounts. Some have sliding
scales, charging less for weeknight games against less-desirable
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Team Marketing Report, a family of four still
spends an average of $145 to $300 at a game. Staples Center President
Tim Leiweke knows his industry has not done enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just cater to the 5% that happens to have a high
discretionary income," he said. "Our ticket prices are getting to the
point where we're limiting our audience."</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, owners have done poorly--one industry
consultant called their efforts "abysmal"--when it comes to making
fans feel important.</TE>
<TE>   Consider an exchange at a recent industry conference in New York
City where Bob Tisch, the wealthy chairman of the New York Giants,
was asked about season-ticket holders forced to pay for unwanted
exhibition games. Tisch said his organization must generate revenue
to be competitive and, besides, he was only following the lead of
other teams.</TE>
<TE>   While other industries have pursued customers by offering more for
the dollar, critics believe sports have gone the opposite direction.
Spectators are treated like small fish despite spending billions each
year on tickets and parking and sodas.</TE>
<TE>   "If [teams] are chasing people out of the arena and onto their
couches, it doesn't matter as long as those people are watching
sports on television," said David Carter of the Sports Business
Group, a Los Angeles consulting firm. "Television is where corporate
America makes its money."</TE>
<TE>   So why are some league and team executives talking about
reinventing the live experience?</TE>
<TE>   First, they have come to realize what network producers knew all
along: A compelling broadcast requires not only a close score but
also a raucous stadium. "The backdrop of the game assumes a throng of
people, and you need to get that feeling on television," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   More significantly, they fear a grass-roots backlash.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen of the 30 Major League Baseball teams suffered a
decrease in attendance in the early weeks of this season. NBA crowds
have declined from a peak of 17,252 in 1995-96 and even the mighty
NFL dipped last fall. Only hockey has managed to boost attendance.</TE>
<TE>   This trend could have a ripple effect. Although more people watch
sports on television than ever before, ratings are diluted across
numerous channels and some executives worry that fans who stop going
to games might eventually turn off their sets.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have fans in the seats, we're on a collision course,"
Schultz said. "It will come back to erode the very engine that drives
our business."</TE>
<TE>   Squeegees and Windex</TE>
<TE>   Jones expresses a similar concern with a personal anecdote.</TE>
<TE>   No one could have been more confident than the Arkansas oilman
when he paid almost $200 million to buy the Cowboys and lease Texas
Stadium in 1989. This was the man, after all, who fired legendary
coach Tom Landry.</TE>
<TE>   So Jones did not hesitate to assume that because he had a stadium,
he might as well get into the business of concert promotion. Sign a
top-name performer, advertise, how hard could it be? But on the night
of his first show, thousands of seats went unfilled.</TE>
<TE>   A friend told him: "When they ain't comin', there's no stopping
'em."</TE>
<TE>   Now Jones takes the job of selling tickets more seriously. He
wants to build a stadium that, while featuring suites and premium
seats, will be designed with the masses in mind.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed $600-million-to-$700-million facility would be
open-ended with standing-room areas behind each end zone. As many as
30,000 fans could pay a less-expensive admission to mill about these
"poor man's luxury boxes," eating and drinking at booths, pushing
forward to see the field or watching on digital monitors.</TE>
<TE>   The designers of Staples Center had something similar in mind when
they included such upper-deck amenities as a terrace with a view of
downtown. Fox Sports President Ed Goren predicts more such
innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see stadiums change," he said. "The stadium
experience has to be something special."</TE>
<TE>   Architecture goes only so far. Two of the newest stadiums in the
nation, PNC Park in Pittsburgh and Miller Park in Milwaukee, have
seen ticket sales decline significantly in their second seasons. And
owners can't always count on a winning team to attract crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the renewed emphasis on customer service. The change has been
gradual, measured in part by teams such as the Florida Panthers and
Cleveland Browns that paid the Sport Management Research Institute to
survey ticket-holders and send workers posing as fans into their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about showing respect," said Kathleen Davis, the
institute's executive director. "For a while, no one was listening to
the fan."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban has won them over with his common
touch, wearing a T-shirt and jeans to games, cheering wildly in the
stands. Leonsis has called upon lessons he learned while helping turn
AOL into a new kind of electronic community.</TE>
<TE>   Since publicizing his e-mail address three years ago, the Capital
owner has answered 22,000 messages, many of them complaints. Prompted
to vent, fans submitted more than 100 kinds of grievances that ranged
well beyond ticket prices.</TE>
<TE>   The protective glass around the ice was dirty, they said. The
cotton-candy vendor didn't come around during the third period. The
smell of garlic fries from the snack bar was overwhelming. Leonsis
published the list online and went about solving many of the
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, you know who gets the biggest cheer every night?" he asked.
"The guys with squeegees and Windex."</TE>
<TE>   They scramble out between periods in dark blue overalls and caps,
looking for all the world like gas-station attendants from the 1950s,
hurrying around to wipe down the glass. Kids mimic their hand motions
from the other side. Older fans point out spots they missed.</TE>
<TE>   It also helped that the Capitals traded for superstar Jaromir
Jagr. But they set a team attendance record this season while failing
to reach the playoffs, and the owner believes the list deserves much
of the credit.</TE>
<TE>   Some fan suggestions remain unaddressed. Management has yet to
provide an in-arena hotline that goes directly to the owner's box or
a live Web cam from the team plane. Leonsis is nonetheless confident
enough in the progress he has made to flash a giant picture of
himself--the bright eyes and smile, the goatee--across the scoreboard
at games.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't do that for ego," he said. "If they clap, we're doing a
good job. If they boo, we've got more work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Thank-You Cards</TE>
<TE>   Do the little things make a difference? Carter, the consultant,
responds to that question with another: "How can you expect people to
keep lining your pockets if you keep alienating them at every turn?"</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, the answer takes shape in small crowds that press
close to the court before games, evidence of changes Schultz enacted
when he and his investor group bought a team that was struggling to
win games and sell tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably came to this very differently than the traditional
sports owner because I've been a season-ticket holder for 19 years,"
he said. "I saw the roller-coaster relationship that existed between
the fans and the Sonics, and I knew we were acquiring the team at one
of the low points."</TE>
<TE>   While pro sports are very much a business, and Schultz has
employed Starbucks-like marketing, he considers it important for the
city to care about its team. Wanting to shorten the distance between
players and the common fan, making his cavernous arena a little more
like one of his street-corner cafes, he began opening the doors early
and letting anyone with a ticket sit courtside to watch the teams
warm up.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hundred fans showed up at first. Now a thousand or more
come, many of them parents with kids. "I can see how big the players
really are," said 12-year-old Eric Boman, who usually sits in the
upper deck with his mother, Janice.</TE>
<TE>   At the owner's urging, SuperSonic players rank among the league
leaders in community appearances and recently sat down to write
thank-you cards to every season-ticket holder. When a longtime fan
decided not to renew his seats, Schultz called twice asking him to
come back and a third time to thank him when he did.</TE>
<TE>   "This team has been given back to the community," said Benny
Bridges Sr., who attends games with his 11-year-old son, Benny Jr.
"The fans need to know they are important."</TE>
<TE>   It helps that Schultz is the king of coffee in a city known for
its beans. Fans recognize his combed-back hair and smile, gathering
near when he walks through the arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I've met him a couple of times," said Josh Roque, a 21-year-old
retail salesman. "Usually someone in his position wouldn't be so open
to the public."</TE>
<TE>   To put all of this in perspective, imagine Los Angeles fans lining
up for Donald Sterling's autograph. Would they even recognize Philip
Anschutz, the intensely private billionaire who is majority owner of
the Kings, Galaxy and Staples Center?</TE>
<TE>   The push to make KeyArena "fan friendly" has yet to show results
in an important category--the SuperSonics averaged 15,388 fans this
season, roughly the same as last season. But NBA Commissioner David
Stern was impressed enough to bring his management team for a closer
look in March. And Davis said her research suggests that customer
service, while no quick fix, eventually translates into ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz is likewise convinced that he and a few others in the
industry are on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a new breed of owners who recognize that this is not a
zero-sum game and we have to take care of the people," Schultz said.
"I hope the rest of them get it."</TE>

<HD>It's Never Too Early for Choi</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was 4 a.m. in South Korea when K.J. Choi began the final round of
the Compaq Classic at New Orleans. The hour didn't stop his fans from
watching on television.</LD>
<LD>   "People will miss work to watch," said Hie-Man Hwang, a South
Korean journalist who flew in for Sunday's round. "He can make
history, it's a very big thing in Korea."</LD>
<LD>   Choi did not disappoint the fans back home, becoming the first
South Korean winner in PGA Tour history, closing with a
five-under-par 67 for a four-stroke victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe it will influence a generation of Korean golfers to
come to the U.S. and try out for the PGA," Choi said through an
interpreter. "In that sense, the win is very special."</TE>
<TE>   Choi earned the $810,000 winner's check with a 17-under 271 total,
holding off a number of challengers in ideal scoring conditions at on
the English Turn course.</TE>
<TE>   Geoff Ogilvy and Dudley Hart came the closest, each finishing with
a 68 to tie for second at 13-under 275. John Cook (66), Chris DiMarco
(68), Mike Sposa (68) and Dan Forsman (70) were 13 under.</TE>
<TE>   "The greens kept getting harder and faster and browner and
slippery, as I like to say," Hart said. "It was very slick and,
actually, hard to read sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Choi, who took the lead in the second round, was tied but never
trailed after that. He took it slow and steady in the 91-degree heat
as the field surged toward him.</TE>
<TE>   "This win is very special to me because when I first came to the
U.S. I had a 10-year plan laid out," Choi said. "It's earlier than I
though it would happen, but it's part of the plan."</TE>
<TE>   Choi had two birdies on the front nine for a one-stroke lead at
the turn, and made a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 11 to go to 15
under--two shots ahead of three players. He increased his lead with a
birdie on No. 13. His second shot on the 16th rolled to the lip of
the cup and sat there, a breath away from an eagle and a five-shot
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Choi described that as the turning point in the round. He said he
knew it was a good shot, but did not think it was an eagle.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had gone in the crowd would have gone wild," the
interpreter said. "He didn't think the crowd went wild enough."</TE>
<TE>   Choi chipped in for his final birdie on No. 17--a 35-footer from
out of the rough. By the time he bogeyed No. 18, he had nothing to
worry about.</TE>

<TE>   Juli Inkster overcame an extended layoff to win the rain-plagued
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship at Stockbridge, Ga., shooting a
six-under 66 for a two-stroke victory.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster returned to the course for the first time since Friday
afternoon, having waited through two days of incessant rain that
forced the tournament to be reduced from 54 to 36 holes.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA Hall of Famer overcame a two-shot deficit at the start of
the round to earn the 27th victory of her career with a 12-under 132
total.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been out here forever," the 41-year-old Inkster said. "I
should know how to handle it."</TE>
<TE>   The muddy course was bathed in bright sunshine at the end, and
Inkster finished in style with an eagle at No. 18. She hit her second
shot to within six feet of the hole, then pumped her fist and waved
her visor when the putt dropped in.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Robbins, who led by two strokes after the first round,
struggled much of the day but finished birdie-birdie-eagle to take
second with a 70 for the round and 134 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Defending tournament champion Annika Sorenstam shot a 69 in the
first round but couldn't cope with the water-logged course at Eagles
Landing Country Club. She soared to a 75--only the second time in 20
rounds this year that she's been over par.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Rachels was busy worrying about his playing partners in the
Bruno's Memorial Classic at Hoover, Ala. Dana Quigley just sneaked up
on him.</TE>
<TE>   Rachels made a 10-foot birdie putt on the second hole of a playoff
with Quigley, earning $210,000 for his first victory of the season
and third on the Senior PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know about Dana until I was on the 17th hole. I
looked over there and said, 'Where'd he come from?'" Rachels said.</TE>
<TE>   Rachels closed with a five-under 67 to match Quigley at 15-under
201, outdistancing more high-profile playing partners Hale Irwin and
Larry Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   Rachels made the winning putt on the 17th hole after Quigley
missed an 18-footer and tapped in for par. Both players birdied the
18th hole to begin the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Kresge made a 45-foot eagle chip on the second hole of a
playoff with Arron Oberholser to win the Buy.com Tour's Virginia
Beach Open at Virginia Beach, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "When it got close to the hole, I instinctively put my arms in the
air thinking it might go in," Kresge said. "Even if it wouldn't have
gone in, I had executed the shot the way I wanted and it was going to
be pretty close for birdie."</TE>
<TE>   Kresge, who earned $76,500 for his first Buy.com Tour title,
closed with a one-under 71 to match Oberholser (70) at 11-under 277.</TE>

<LD>Although the stage and the stakes were a lot smaller and the margin
of victory was a lot closer, jockey Victor Espinoza struck again with
a front-running longshot in his return to California.</LD>
<LD>   A day after his wire-to-wire shocker aboard War Emblem in the
Kentucky Derby, the red-hot rider and Night Patrol, an 8-1 outsider,
led all the way in winning the $109,700 Inglewood Handicap on Sunday
at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Nick Canani for owner-breeder Everest Stables, Night
Patrol--a 6-year-old Storm Boot gelding--bravely held off 7-5
favorite Redattore by half a length to win in a rapid 1:39 1/5 for
the 1 1/16 miles on turf.</LD>
<TE>   Fourth in last month's Arcadia Handicap at Santa Anita after
pressing a quick pace at nine furlongs, the fifth choice in the field
of eight was able to coast from his inside post through a 24-second
opening quarter and maintained an advantage of half a length over the
runner-up the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   This was the second victory in as many starts on the Hollywood
Park turf for Night Patrol, who has won eight of 41 in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like Saturday, I definitely wanted to be on the lead," said
Espinoza, who, after the first two weeks of the Hollywood Park meet,
leads the rider standings with 12 victories, four in stakes. "When I
rode him last time, I think I waited a little too much.</TE>
<TE>   "He was dragging me all the way around. I fought him too much
trying to take him back. It was a little bit of a mistake. Today, I
decided just to let him go. When he took the lead, he was very
relaxed and really slowed it down. He finished pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since winning the San Antonio Handicap on
the main track at Santa Anita on Feb. 3, Redattore finished two
lengths in front of 3-1 second-choice Seinne, then came Sumitas,
Gallant, Kerrygold and El Gran Papa.</TE>
<TE>   Seinne, who had won the Arcadia at nearly 13-1 odds with a strong
late run, was victimized by the lack of pace. He made up some ground
in the final furlong but the first two were still running strong,
covering the final sixteenth in six seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "[Trainer] Ron McAnally wanted me back and they went too slow up
front," said Eddie Delahoussaye, the replacement rider on Seinne. "He
came running, but the two in front of me kept going."</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye inherited the mount on Seinne because Chris McCarron,
who had won the Arcadia with the 5-year-old, decided to stay in
Kentucky for another day because of an ear infection.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron had finished sixth with Came Home in the Derby a day
after his upset victory aboard Farda Amiga in the Kentucky Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a successful 2002 debut in the $113,200 Beaugay Handicap at
Aqueduct, Voodoo Dancer could be headed to California.</TE>
<TE>   After the 4-year-old Kingmambo filly won the Grade III by nearly
three lengths as the 11-10 favorite under jockey Jerry Bailey,
trainer Christophe Clement said she could run in the $500,000 Gamely
Breeders' Cup Handicap on May 27.</TE>
<TE>   Making her first start since finishing seventh as the 17-10
favorite in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup on Oct. 13 at Keeneland,
Voodoo Dancer won for the seventh time in 11 tries on the final day
of the Aqueduct meet. She ran the 11/16 miles on turf in 1:43 and has
won each of her four races at the distance.</TE>

<LD>That's four pretty average playoff games in four tries for the
Lakers, which got Brian Shaw to thinking about what Portland Trail
Blazer guard Steve Kerr said last week.</LD>
<LD>   "Last year, they didn't look beatable," Shaw recited from memory.
"This year they do."</LD>
<LD>   He shrugged. They've gotten this far on poor shooting and a
rhythm-less offense, he said, which leaves plenty of opportunity for
improvement. Still, Shaw felt it necessary to dispute Kerr's
assessment.</LD>
<TE>   "That's fine," he said. "We don't think we are. We have a lot
better games in us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, before Shaquille O'Neal had narrowed it down to a
"Spider-Man" incident, a Laker official said O'Neal had suffered
"some kind of household accident."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal required four stitches low on his left forearm after his
arm crashed into a bathroom glass, apparently while pretending to
climb a wall. He attended "Spider-Man" Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 was there for O'Neal and Kobe Bryant at the end in part
because of what Samaki Walker did in the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Ineffective in the first round against Portland, Walker played
gamely against San Antonio's Tim Duncan, and in 25 minutes had 12
points and nine rebounds. He made five of six shots, two in the third
quarter after taking offensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the third quarter, with the Spurs leading, 40-39, Walker
and Duncan each had 10 points and Walker never got in foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the game, the Lakers doubled hard at Duncan, often
forcing him to find open shooters on the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim is a great player," Walker said. "There's no one player who
can stop him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox hopes to spend his summer involved in two acting
projects, he said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   He is considering parts in two movies-- "Holes" and "August and
Everything After."</TE>
<TE>   Fox had to ease off a regular gig on the HBO series "Oz" because
it often was shot during basketball season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pregame Phil Jackson, on whether he prepared as though David
Robinson would play Sunday: "Did he travel with the team?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he dressed in uniform?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   "OK then. That's why you plan."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson did not play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored 32 points in the first half, their season
low.... Bryant missed six of 10 free-throw attempts.</TE>

<DH>Game 1: O'Neal gets stitches in forearm and finger, Bryant
suffers knee injury, and Lakers grimace and bear up to take 1-0 lead
in conference semifinals.</DH>

<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First Shaquille O'Neal bled on the floor and then Kobe Bryant was
carried off it. Afterward, when they had returned one by one, Derek
Fisher said, "Fortunately for us, our monster is two-headed."</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have won four of four playoff games while playing just
well enough to keep a league moderately convinced of their
superiority, which will do for now.</LD>
<LD>   They're not functioning particularly Laker-like, a corner they
play themselves into and out of a couple times a week, though often
enough now to sweep the Portland Trail Blazers and to take a
first-strike lead on the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<TE>   They did it all again Sunday afternoon at Staples Center, this
time with the added variables of injuries to O'Neal and Bryant and
routine second-half deficits. They beat the Spurs, 86-80, in the
first game of the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals,
despite all that happened to them, and because of late and brilliant
plays made by O'Neal and Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a great day," O'Neal admitted on his way home.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 23 points, 13 in a fourth quarter when the Lakers
scored 29, and 17 rebounds. Bryant scored 20 points. Samaki Walker,
who played 25 minutes, most of them against Tim Duncan, had 12 points
and took nine rebounds. Duncan, who had 26 points and 21 rebounds,
missed his first 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   It was good enough, but just so, because little went as planned,
other than the final quarter, and then only once they had all of
their players on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting all year to get to this point," Bryant said.
"If you can walk, you belong out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers sent their two best players to their cars stitched and
limping, one unable to feel his right hand and the other all too able
to feel his knee.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Gary Vitti, who has done this for 18 years, said he didn't
believe O'Neal would play after tearing open the forefinger on his
shooting hand in the third quarter. Doctors numbed it and put three
stitches in it, and then O'Neal--his left forearm already sliced and
stitched after a morning accident suffered, he said, while pretending
to be Spider-Man in his home--was on the receiving end of a Robert
Horry alley-oop in what became the game-winning points. O'Neal said
he thought he had been cut on the rim early in the third quarter, but
wasn't sure. By then, he didn't much care.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through every situation imaginable in basketball,"
O'Neal said. "We know what it takes to win games. It was one of those
days for us, and we still mustered up enough energy to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he said, "It felt like I had four fingers."</TE>
<TE>   And Vitti didn't believe Bryant would return after a "tennis
ball-sized lump"--the trainer's description--rose up on Bryant's
right knee in the fourth quarter. Vitti said he'd never seen anything
like the thing on Bryant's knee, a pooling of blood so large and
angry and limiting. Vitti iced it and bullied the swelling out, then
watched Bryant slide off the table, return to the floor and make the
biggest shot of the game, a seven-foot,
stop-spin-and-watch-Bruce-Bowen-fly-by baby floater that gave the
Lakers an 83-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm exhausted," Vitti said and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's injury is considered more serious. He left with several
rolls of tape in his hand, a gait that favored his right side and a
promise to know more today, when the warmth of the game and the cool
of the ice are gone. Bryant was kicked inadvertently by Bowen early
in the fourth quarter, came out as a freshly bandaged O'Neal came in,
and returned with 4:36 left.</TE>
<TE>   "I was listening," Brian Shaw said of his concern for O'Neal, "for
the Superman music to come on."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's shot, four minutes later, all but finished the Spurs, who
were forced to foul after that. On the shot, Bryant screeched to a
stop on his right leg. When the shot fell, he punched the air and
shouted, then fell into a chair on the bench and grimaced.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any choice," he said. "It was such a big play in
the game. I wanted to flip the ball to Robert [Horry], but they
closed the lane off. So, I didn't have any choice. It was going to be
that or turn the ball over."</TE>
<TE>   Though all else was frantic and borderline poor basketball--the
Spurs, anchored by Duncan's nine for 30, shot 31.8% from the floor,
and the Lakers shot 39%--the Lakers clung to O'Neal and hugged
Bryant. So they have won 20 of their last 21 postseason games, and
five of five against the Spurs, including last year's sweep in the
conference finals. They have won 18 consecutive games at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside of them," the Spurs' Antonio Daniels said of O'Neal and
Bryant, "we let an opportunity get away."</TE>
<TE>   Just them, was all.</TE>
<TE>   "We never felt out of control of the game," Fisher said. "We never
felt like we couldn't win."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Patience paid off for Tony Stewart in the wreck-filled Pontiac
Excitement 400.</LD>
<LD>   Steering clear of a record-tying number of accidents, Stewart
pulled away from rookie Ryan Newman on a restart with 17 laps to go
Sunday in the rain-delayed race.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart led the last 27 laps at Richmond (Va.) International
Raceway, where he's won two straight spring races and three times in
seven career starts. The victory was his 14th in 115 NASCAR Winston
Cup events.</LD>
<TE>   He also moved from 10th place to eighth in the points race,
putting behind him the disappointment of consecutive 29th-place runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably ran one of the most patient races I've ever run, and
it wasn't because I wanted to, but because I had to," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   There were a track record-tying 14 caution periods and a record
103 laps run under the yellow flag.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of guys that were being very courteous, a lot of
give and take going on out there," Stewart said. "And then there were
a lot of guys that were in a big hurry, and it seemed like the guys
that got in a hurry, sure enough, as time went on they were dropping
out like flies."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart qualified third but started 41st when the race began
Saturday night because he'd changed his engine. He was 27th when the
race resumed for the final 334 laps after what amounted to a 14-hour
rain delay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terry Cook broke an 88-race NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series victory
drought, winning the Dodge Ram Tough 200 at Madison, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Cook brought his Ford F-150 from the eighth starting position to
the lead by the 91st of 160 laps.</TE>
<TE>   He lost the lead on the 106th lap in making his final of two pit
stops. Cook took over for good when leader Jason Leffler pitted his
Dodge 11 laps later.</TE>
<TE>   Cook held a 7.5-second lead over Leffler after the pit-stop cycle,
a margin that grew to 8.564 seconds at the checkered flag. He
averaged 109.323 mph for 200 miles and earned $52,160 for his first
victory since 1998. Pole-winner Mike Bliss finished third in a
Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon raced to his fifth top-fuel victory of the season,
beating Doug Herbert in the final of the NHRA Southern Nationals at
Commerce, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon had a quarter-mile run of 4.637 seconds at 318.09 mph.
Herbert finished in 5.039 at 231.87.</TE>
<TE>   Whit Bazemore and Allen Johnson also won their divisions. Bazemore
beat funny car points leader John Force with a run of 4.963 at
310.41. Johnson edged Greg Anderson in pro stock. Johnson had a run
of 6.907 at 200.92.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The new "soft" walls at Indianapolis Motor Speedway have passed
their first real test.</TE>
<TE>   Robbie McGehee became the first driver to crash into the walls and
suffered only a cut on his left leg after crashing in Turn 3 during
the first Indy 500 practice session.</TE>
<TE>   McGehee hit the wall going 218-219 mph with the back end going
almost straight into the wall at a 90-degree angle.</TE>

<HD>Beating Hornets Is Kidd Stuff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Jason Kidd won the point-guard showdown with Baron Davis somewhat by
default.</LD>
<LD>   With the game on the line, Kidd stepped up for the New Jersey Nets
and Davis was not much of a factor for the Charlotte Hornets.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd made a go-ahead jumper and scored six of the Nets' final
eight points to lead New Jersey to a 99-93 victory over the
undermanned Hornets in the opening game of the Eastern Conference
best-of-seven semifinal series on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I had to be aggressive," Kidd said after finishing with 21 points
to lead seven Nets in double figures. "I was riding my teammates for
a while. They got us that far, so I knew I had to do something.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have gotten a box of popcorn because I was watching
everyone else play for so long. I was very lucky that those shots
went down."</TE>
<TE>   While Kidd was taking the big shots, Davis was passing the ball to
open teammates during crunch time, and they weren't making any.</TE>
<TE>   David Wesley and Stacey Augmon each threw up an airball with the
Hornets trailing, 95-91, in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make plays," Davis said, who scored 23 points but did
not take a shot in the final 5:45.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a little disappointed in myself in that I didn't make as
many plays as I should have on the offensive end. On the other hand,
we got some open shots that we usually make and missed them."</TE>
<TE>   Elden Campbell had 22 points for Charlotte, which played without
Jamal Mashburn (viral illness) and Jamaal Magliore (suspension).</TE>
<TE>   Campbell tied the score, 91-91, making one of two free throws with
3:04 left. After that it was all Kidd, who surprisingly only had one
rebound and two assists in the final three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after a timeout, Kidd dribbled around a screen by
Aaron Williams and made a jumper to give the Nets a 93-91 lead with
2:53 left. Campbell missed a jumper and Kidd made a jumper in the
lane for a 95-91 lead with 2:21 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason was being Jason," Net Coach Byron Scott said. "When the
game is on the line and the score is tied, I am calling his number."</TE>

<HD>Clijsters Upsets Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Clijsters rallied from a loss in the first set to defeat
top-ranked and defending champion Venus Williams, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, in
the final of the $585,000 Betty Barclay Cup Sunday at Hamburg,
Germany.</LD>
<LD>   "Venus played so well in the first set. She didn't make any
mistakes," Clijsters said. "I just had to fight back and I got
better."</LD>
<LD>   The 18-year-old Clijsters, ranked No. 3, used powerful
groundstrokes on the slow clay court in the second and third sets to
keep Williams on the defensive and win her seventh title.</LD>
<TE>   Williams, who beat Martina Hingis to reach the title match and
retain the No. 1 ranking for at least another week, capitalized on 12
unforced errors by Clijsters to easily win the first set.</TE>
<TE>   The Belgian teenager ended the match when she drove Williams deep
into the corner and forced a two-handed backhand that missed the
line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was having to hit second serves. I think that was a lot of what
did me in today," Williams said. "But I definitely think she played
great tennis. She served well and moved well and was determined. I
guess that's what counts in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters lost in straight sets at the U.S. Open in her only other
match against Williams. She advanced to the Hamburg final when Jelena
Dokic withdrew in the semifinal round because of injury while
leading, 6-4, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she definitely played better than last time," Williams
said. "She's made a lot of great improvements, but she has a great
base to build on. I think she's a very good player. She's only 18,
when I was 18, I was having fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gaston Gaudio of Argentina defeated Jarkko Nieminen of Finland,
6-2, 6-3, to win the $381,000 Mallorca Open at Palma de Mallorca,
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy with this new triumph in Spain," said the
eighth-seeded Gaudio. "The truth is, I feel at home. Everyone has
treated me well, especially the public, to whom I am very grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Gaudio took a 3-1 lead in the first set and Nieminen looked ready
to come back when he made it 3-2. But Gaudio won the final three
games of the set. The second set was a repeat with Gaudio breaking
serve to take a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aasa Svensson  of Sweden defeated Croatia's Iva Majoli, 6-3, 4-6,
6-1, in her first appearance in the final of the Croatian Bol Ladies
Open at Bol, Croatia. The server won only half of the 26 games in the
1-hour 49-minute match. Svensson played better at the net and served
more accurately. She made fewer errors than Majoli.... Younes El
Aynaoui of Morocco beat Rainer Schuettler of Germany, 6-4, 6-4, in
the final of the BMW Open at Munich.</TE>

<TE>   Derek Plante scored midway through the third period and rallied

the Pittsburgh Penguins scored the winning goal to lead the
three-time defending champion Czech Republic to a 5-1 victory over
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   In Goteborg, Thomas Rhodin scored the winner and had an assist to
lift Sweden to a 4-2 victory over archrival Finland. All six teams
had already wrapped up berths in the quarterfinals, which start
Tuesday.</TE>

<DH>NHL playoffs: Goaltender stops 45 shots and Montreal
defeats Carolina, 4-1, to even series at 1-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Jose Theodore will be seeing pucks in his sleep.</LD>
<LD>   The Montreal goaltender stopped 45 shots and Saku Koivu had a goal
and an assist, and the Canadiens held off the Carolina Hurricanes,
4-1, Sunday night to even the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinals at one game apiece.</LD>
<LD>   "It'll be a good day [Monday] to relax and rest up," said
Theodore, who has faced 84 shots in two games.</LD>
<TE>   The victory by Montreal ended Carolina's home playoff winning
streak at four and was in sharp contrast to its 2-0 opening loss. In
Game 1, the Hurricanes were more scrappy and outhit the Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal was still outshot, 46-16, Sunday, but the Canadiens were
able to get to goalie Kevin Weekes for two first-period goals--one on
a great hustle play by Koivu--to get a jump on Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens then rode Theodore the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we needed 56 shots," a frustrated Sami Kapanen said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Lindsay sealed it with an empty-net goal with 1 minute 11
seconds left, firing the puck nearly the length of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot easier to play with the lead," said Theodore, who
faced 38 shots in Game 1. "But the Hurricanes made a statement that
they're going to be ready to play every night. They played even
better than the first night."</TE>
<TE>   Weekes had two consecutive shutouts and a goals-against average of
0.90 in the playoffs before Sunday, but couldn't come up big for a
fourth consecutive game since taking over for Arturs Irbe in the New
Jersey series.</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 will be played Tuesday night in the Molson Centre at
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team feels comfortable, especially on the road, where we've
had a lot of success," Carolina captain Ron Francis said. "Nothing is
easy this time of year, but we'll regroup and get ready for our best
game in Game 3."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Gilmour's 60th career playoff goal on the power play 1:03
into the second period gave the Canadiens a three-goal lead before
Rod Brind'Amour's goal with 6.8 seconds left in the period drew the
Hurricanes within 3-1 on a two-man advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Cole poked the puck past Theodore 1:33 into the third, but it
clearly came after the whistle and was waved off by referee Mick
McGeough.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina had several good scoring chances minutes later, but Kevyn
Adams missed an open net short-handed try and Theodore shut down
Carolina's power play.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very well prepared to play seven games in our first
series [against New Jersey] and we're very well prepared to play
seven games again," Carolina Coach Paul Maurice said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big shock by any means in the room that Montreal won a
game."</TE>

undermine Evgeni Nabokov's confidence, Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley is
trying to do his part as well.</LD>
<LD>   The San Jose Sharks returned home Sunday after two tough Western
Conference semifinal games in Denver. They emerged with one victory
and dozens of questions about their ability to compete with the
defending Stanley Cup champions, as well the toughness of Nabokov,
their talented young goalie.</LD>
<LD>   Game 3 is tonight in San Jose, where the Sharks will attempt to
recapture the confidence they gained in a 6-3 Game 1 victory--and
then lacked in an 8-2 loss Saturday that snapped a four-game winning
streak and forced Coach Darryl Sutter to pull Nabokov in the third
period.</LD>
<TE>   Hartley stirred the pot by suggesting that Sutter might start
backup Miikka Kiprusoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Darryl has all day to make up his mind," Hartley said. "It will
be interesting to see how Nabokov will react if he gets the start.
It's always tough for any goalie to come back after a bad
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing that a young goalie wants to have is a bad game,
especially in the playoffs where they are going home. It could be an
interesting start."</TE>
<TE>   Sutter wouldn't respond directly to Hartley's statements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great that their coaching staff is now making some
of our decisions," Sutter said. "That takes some work off of me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Jyrki Lumme is out of the playoffs indefinitely because of
a concussion, depleting the Toronto Maple Leafs' defense.</TE>
<TE>   Maple Leaf Coach Pat Quinn also said that Lumme has an injury to
his upper body, but wouldn't specify further. Lumme sat out four
games late in the regular season with a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   Lumme was hurt when he was checked hard into the boards by
Ottawa's Chris Neil in the first period of Game 2 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Santiago Saves Day for the Giants in 10th</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ahead in the count, 2-and-0, Benito Santiago knew what was coming.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants and Cincinnati Reds were tied, 5-5, in
the bottom of the 10th inning Sunday at Pacific Bell Park, and Luis
Pineda had just walked J.T. Snow and Reggie Sanders.</LD>
<LD>   "I figured he was going to come right down the center of the
plate," Santiago said. "And he did."</LD>
<TE>   Santiago singled home the winning run, giving the Giants a 6-5
victory and a three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, who trailed, 5-3, going into the eighth inning, have
won four in a row and six of seven after losing a season-high four in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, half a game behind first-place Arizona in the National
League West, head to New York for a three-game series with the Mets
starting Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Snow pulled the Giants within 5-4 with a single in the eighth
inning against Danny Graves, who had converted nine consecutive save
chances.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the ninth, Ramon Martinez, pinch-hitter Rich
Aurilia and David Bell hit consecutive singles to tie the score.
Graves struck out Marvin Benard, then loaded the bases with an
intentional walk to Barry Bonds, who had homered earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent grounded out, sending the game into extra innings. It
was the third blown save for Graves in 13 chances.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Montreal 2--Luis Gonzalez homered and Junior Spivey
drove in three runs, and the Diamondbacks completed a three-game
sweep at Phoenix. The Expos, swept for the first time this season,
lost the last four of their six-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, St. Louis 2--Greg Maddux pitched six shutout innings
and Andruw Jones homered at St. Louis. The Braves won two of three in
the series despite scoring only eight runs. The Cardinals have lost
14 of 20 and have scored six runs in the last 34 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 6, Pittsburgh 5--Catcher Tom Lampkin, batting only .138
before the game, hit a two-run triple to center field at San Diego to
help the Padres, who won two of three in the series and have won
eight of 11.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Milwaukee 4--Marlin starter A.J. Burnett doubled twice
for his first two hits this season to help gain the victory at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett (5-2) gave up four runs and six hits in seven innings and
won for the fourth time in five starts. He was hitless in 14 at-bats
before hitting a run-scoring double in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Colorado 4--Reserves Tomas Perez and Jason
Michaels each had three hits at Philadelphia, and the Phillies won
for their first three-game winning streak this season.</TE>

<HD>Pistons Just Point to the Defense</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Detroit also converts a team playoff-record
12 three-point shots to stop Celtics, 96-84.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Pistons tried their best to deflect attention from the
obvious reasons they took a 1-0 lead in their series against the
Boston Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, they were pleased to make a team playoff-record 12
three-point shots and were glad to remain undefeated when Cliff
Robinson and Jerry Stackhouse each score at least 20 points.</LD>
<LD>   But they insisted it was all about their defense.</LD>
<TE>   Robinson scored 30 points, and Stackhouse had 26 points and set
career playoff highs with 11 rebounds and eight assists Sunday as
Detroit beat the Celtics, 96-84, to win Game 1 in the Eastern
Conference best-of-seven semifinal series.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons held Boston to 37.5% shooting--Antoine Walker and Paul
Pierce combined to make only 14 of 39 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Walker scored 20 points and Pierce was limited to 17, one game
after he scored 46 in Game 5 of the Celtics' first-round series
against Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always about our defense when we win," said Robinson, who
was the lead defender against Walker and was two points shy of his
best postseason performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not be able to continue shooting and scoring like this,
but we have to stick with this defensive effort because defense is
our staple."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Curry scored a career playoff-high 15 points. He made only
seven three-point shots during the regular season, but made all three
of his attempts against the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite what we did offensively, I don't want anybody to overlook
what we did defensively," said Curry, who played a season-high 40
minutes, often matched against Pierce. "That's going to be the key
for us if we're going to win this series."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce said his scoring was down not because of what the Pistons
did, but because his aggressive teammates took some shots away.</TE>
<TE>   He was seven for 17, and teammates Kenny Anderson, who scored 17,
and Rodney Rogers, who scored eight, took a combined 27 shots, making
33.3%.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't have the number of opportunities that I've had,"
said Pierce, who averaged four more shots against the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons were 11-0 during the regular season when Robinson and
Stackhouse each scored at least 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   The two did it for the first time in the playoffs Sunday to extend
the streak.</TE>

<HD>For Now It Works, Even if It's a Pain</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When pricked, they bleed. When slapped, they bruise.</LD>
<LD>   When out of position, they brick, and when out of rhythm, they
stink.</LD>
<LD>   This will come as a shock to the shocked San Antonio Spurs, but
the Lakers' 86-80 victory in Game 1 of the Western Conference
semifinals Sunday wasn't only about the champions' superpowers.</LD>
<TE>   It was also about their vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only about the raucous standing ovation in the final
minute, but also about the scattering of boos in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   We've heard those cheers. The boos were new.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't only about Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant coming to
the rescue, but also about the struggling veterans who have required
such a rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Superman and Wonderboy, we've seen. But Rick Fox, Derek Fisher and
Brian Shaw combining to go four for 23, that's new.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers walked away from Sunday's mosh pit of a victory with
visible smiles of relief.</TE>
<TE>   But for the third time in four playoff games, they were only
moments from regret.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant bit his lip and spun on his painful knee and made a
seven-footer to save them Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry struck gold with a rainbow last weekend to save them
in the clincher in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant grabbed a late rebound, and Fox and Fisher each sank free
throws to save them from a Trail Blazer rally in Game 2 against
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   This time last year, eight of their first 11 playoff victories
were double-digit strength.</TE>
<TE>   This year, it has been all savvy.</TE>
<TE>   The giant O'Neal's tiny bleeding finger injury Sunday was not
serious, but symbolic.</TE>
<TE>   The valiant Bryant's swollen right knee, strong enough to allow
him to return to the game, was less about the mishap than the
metaphor.</TE>
<TE>   This spring is not last spring. This will not be as easy. This
will not be as pretty.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers keep leaping moats and scaling turrets and staying
one step ahead of the dragon, this spring could ultimately be more
fun.</TE>
<TE>   But it also could ultimately be a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Think the news has reached Sacramento that the Lakers have
scratched for four victories against the dysfunctional Trail Blazers
and David Robinson-less Spurs?</TE>
<TE>   The bad thing isn't that Laker fans are booing. It's that everyone
else in the playoffs is watching.</TE>
<TE>   "We are as vulnerable as we were last year," said Bryant, but he
agreed there was a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "I think last year, it just got to the point where teams were
intimidated by us," he said. "When teams are intimidated by you, they
cannot see your vulnerabilities and weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   This year, that aura of intimidation is slowly dissipating.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, they have won 20 of their last 21 playoff games, a record
postseason stretch for any team in any of the four major sports.</TE>
<TE>   And, surely, it seems unfair to complain that they aren't winning
by enough.</TE>
<TE>   But something is missing. Something big enough that it cannot be
swallowed by the emotion of an Horry-to-O'Neal alley-oop. Something
that cannot be blamed on the television-caused playoff inactivity
that didn't seem to bother the Lakers last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's struggles also cannot be attributed entirely to the two
injuries to the league's two best players.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and O'Neal played together until 8:46 remained in the third
quarter. At that point, the Lakers trailed by one.</TE>
<TE>   The next time they both played together, with 4:36 remaining in
the game, the Lakers led by one.</TE>
<TE>   Thus describes the unevenness of the Lakers' effort. Until the
final minutes, the team played better with just one of their stars.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we haven't played our quote-unquote perfect game yet,"
Fisher said. "But in the back of our minds, I don't think that's a
concern. We only care about winning our third straight championship,
and we don't care what form or fashion we use in doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Fox smiled and said he warned us.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're gonna win," he said. "But before the playoffs, I
said that I didn't know how aesthetically pleasing that would be."</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetically, so far, they look like this:</TE>
<TE>   A team cruising through games with the calm of one who knows he
can hit the gas at the last minute and still win.</TE>
<TE>   A team cruising toward a memorable spot in NBA history.</TE>
<TE>   Or a team cruising for a bruising.</TE>

<LD>The L.A. Track Nuts have signed to become co-hosts of the all-comers
track meets this summer with the Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>

somewhere in East Los Angeles to the June 25-July 30 schedule, which
includes Tuesday meets at San Pedro High, Wednesday meets at Van Nuys
Birmingham High and Thursday meets at the new site.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Track Nuts, a nonprofit organization, will look to
provide funding for more venues as well as to provide busing for
inner city youths to the schools in outlying areas.</LD>
<TE>   Each all-comers meet includes competition for elementary and
middle-school participants at 6 p.m., followed by high school and
adult competition beginning at 8 p.m. There are no entry fees for
competitors.</TE>

<LD>Thousands of fans took to the streets of Amsterdam; Turin, Italy, and
Valencia, Spain, Sunday, just as their fellow fans had done in
Dortmund, Germany, and Lyon, France, the day before.</LD>
<LD>   They were celebrating championship victories by teams that waited
until the waning days of the season to clinch their titles.</LD>
<LD>   In Amsterdam, Ajax, featuring U.S. World Cup team midfielder John
O'Brien, won its 28th Dutch championship and its first since 1998.
Celebrations got so boisterous that police had to use tear gas and
water cannons to clear some downtown streets. It was Ajax's first
championship under Coach Ronald Koeman, a former defender on the
Dutch national team.</LD>
<TE>   In Turin, black- and white-clad Juventus supporters celebrated the
club's improbable success in a season that had seemed to be going
entirely Inter Milan's way. But Inter, which could have clinched its
first Serie A title since 1989, crashed to a 4-2 defeat against Lazio
in Rome, while Juventus, which had started the day two points behind,
shut out Udinese, 2-0, to win the "Scudetto" by a single point over
last year's winner, AS Roma. Inter finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, Juventus was coached to its 26th championship by Marcello
Lippi, who was fired by Inter at the beginning of last season. Inter
Milan's Argentine Coach Hector Cuper was left dazed by the setback,
which once again deprived Brazil's Ronaldo of a coveted Serie A
title.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrible," Cuper said. "We had the opportunity to bring
joy to Inter fans. I am very, very sorry."</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, Valencia got goals from Argentina's Roberto Ayala and
Brazil's Fabio Aurelio Sunday to defeat Malaga, 2-0, for its first
Spanish championship since 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, which desperately wanted the title in its centenary
year, was knocked out of contention when it was held to a scoreless
tie at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, whose south stands were left
deserted when the radical Ultra Sur fans, who have a reputation for
hooliganism, abandoned the stadium in protest of the arrest or four
of their number.</TE>
<TE>   There was trouble too at Villareal, where Real Zaragoza players
had to flee to the locker room as irate fans invaded the field after
the team lost, thus assuring itself of demotion to the second
division for the first time in 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund clinched the Bundesliga title with
a victory on the final day of the German season to finish just ahead
of Bayer Leverkusen, which has never won the championship but has
been runner-up in four of the last six seasons. German national team
midfielder Michael Ballack did finish as the Bundesliga's top goal
scorer for Leverkusen, which still has two chances to salvage
something. It plays Schalke 04 in the German Cup final on Saturday
and Real Madrid in the European Champions League final on May 15 in
Glasgow, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Dortmund Coach Matthias Sammer also is chasing a double. Borussia
will play Feyenoord of the Netherlands in the UEFA Cup final on
Wednesday in Rotterdam.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in history, the French championship came down
to the final day of the season with the last two contenders for the
title--Olympique Lyon and RC Lens--facing each other. Lyon prevailed,
3-1, Saturday to end a 52-year quest for the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Arsenal shut out Chelsea, 2-0, on goals by Ray
Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg to win the English F.A. Cup for the
eighth time. In Scotland, Rangers rode two goals by Peter
Lovenkrands, including one in the last minute, to edge Celtic, 3-2,
and win the Scottish Cup.</TE>

<KH>SPUR NOTES</KH>
<HD>Robinson's Back Against Wall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Robinson has heard the whispers throughout his career, that
he's not tough enough, not inspired enough, not gritty enough.</LD>
<LD>   And now comes another round of questions, as he watches again from
the bench in street clothes while his teammates struggle to make up
for his absence.</LD>
<LD>   Robinson has a nerve problem in his lower back from a herniated
disk that limited him to seven minutes in the Spurs' previous playoff
series against Seattle.</LD>
<TE>   The pain has spread all the way down to his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "The ankle feels a little better," Robinson said. "I guess the
doctors are worried about me flipping my ankle and tearing it up, but
it's starting to get stronger."</TE>
<TE>   So much so that Robinson had a flicker of hope Saturday that he
would be able to play in Sunday's series opener against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   But that hope quickly flickered out.</TE>
<TE>   "One minute I feel like I'm ready," Robinson said, "the next
minute, no way."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was on the court shooting jumpers nearly two hours before
game time, but it had already been determined that he wouldn't play.
So he sits on the bench and waits.</TE>
<TE>   Spur Coach Gregg Popovich said there's nothing doctors can do
about Robinson's health. "Playing with pain is no problem for this
guy, the leg is just not working," Popovich said. "The nerve is going
to heal on its own time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Malik Rose figured it was a reasonable question. The first time,
the second and maybe even the third.</TE>
<TE>   But after awhile, he began to roll his eyes as interviewer after
interviewer asked the same thing: With Shaquille O'Neal and then Kobe
Bryant out for a stretch with injuries, did he feel the Spurs let an
opportunity slip away?</TE>
<TE>   "Deja vu," Rose finally responded when asked the question again.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, he told a television reporter who innocently tried
the same angle, "This is the last time I will answer that question."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but it is a question the Spurs probably were asking
themselves long into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Even Rose had to admit that the Spurs missed a chance. Especially
after the Lakers shot only 39% from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we did," he said. "They're not going to shoot that bad
[in Game 2] Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Duncan's 12 rebounds in the first quarter were a franchise
postseason record. The old mark was 10 by Robinson in the first
quarter of a 1996 playoff game against the Phoenix Suns.</TE>

<HD>4 Relatives Found Dead in Arson</HD>
<DH>Fire: It is not known whether members of the Hollywood
Hills family were killed before the blaze broke out. No one has been
arrested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bodies of four family members were found in a Hollywood Hills
home damaged by a fire that authorities said Sunday was intentionally
set.</LD>
<LD>   It was not known whether the four people--a 43-year-old woman, her
16-year-old daughter, 18-year-old son and her mother-in-law--died in
the fire or were previously killed, said Los Angeles Police
Robbery-Homicide Capt. Jim Tatreau.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have any suspects," Tatreau said Sunday evening. "No one
has been eliminated at this point."</LD>
<TE>   Harish "Harry" Kumar, the woman's husband, reported the blaze to
the Los Angeles Fire Department at 11:16 p.m. Saturday and was being
interviewed by authorities at the Hollywood police station most of
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Kumar, 47, who owns three motels in the Los Angeles area, was
standing on his front lawn screaming for help, saying his family was
inside, when firefighters arrived three minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire has been listed as incendiary, which means it was
intentionally set," said Jim Wells, Los Angeles City Fire Department
spokesman. Investigators found more than one point of origin for the
blaze, which took 30 minutes to put out, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Arson investigators, county coroner's investigators and
robbery-homicide detectives spent Sunday sifting the debris for
evidence, even retaining samples of the water used to quash the fire
at the one-story, three-bedroom home in the 2900 block of Lakeridge
Drive. A dog trained to smell fire accelerants was brought to the
scene. Investigators also hauled away Kumar's silver minivan on a
flatbed truck.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives identified the dead as Gita Kumar, 43, Tulsi
Kumar, 16, Paras Kumar, 18, and Sitaben Patel, 63.</TE>
<TE>   "To lose everybody like that," said Govind Patel, Gita Kumar's
brother. "That's really something. If only his son or daughter had
survived, to help him get through this. But there's nobody."</TE>
<TE>   Patel said the coroner's office told him the bodies were so badly
burned that official identification will require dental records.</TE>
<TE>   Harish Kumar had been out Saturday night with friends, according
to relatives. They said he was eager to get home because his son
Paras had come home from UC San Diego to spend the weekend with his
family, as he had every weekend since starting college last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Chantu Patel, another relative, said he and three other men had
driven with Harish Kumar on Saturday to a volleyball tournament in
Bakersfield. He said Kumar dropped him off at Universal City Inn, a
motel the family owned, about 10:30 p.m. and then dropped off one
other man nearby before heading home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of minutes before the fire was reported," Chantu
Patel said. Detectives on Sunday questioned the man Kumar dropped off
last, Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and relatives said the family was close and enjoyed
spending time together. They accumulated considerable wealth and had
just remodeled their Hollywood Hills home.</TE>
<TE>   "They were as good as gold," Chantu Patel said. "They had no
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Govind Patel said the family moved to the United States from India
about 23 years ago. Harish and Gita Kumar started out with jobs in a
hotel in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   They saved money, moved to California in 1990 and bought the first
of three motels, Universal City Inn in Studio City. They later opened
the Royal Inn Motel in Los Angeles and the Hollywood Stars Inn on
Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel employees described the couple as hard-working and friendly.
They were dedicated to their business, even living at the Universal
City Inn for several years. It allowed them to stay on top of
business and save money for the home they always wanted.</TE>
<TE>   They bought that house two years ago for $475,000, in an exclusive
hillside neighborhood with million-dollar homes. Hotel employees said
the Kumars were excited about their first home in America, coming
more than 15 years after they were sworn in as U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Govind Patel described his sister as a dedicated mother and a
sharp businesswoman. Gita often brought her children to the motels,
sometimes allowing them to do odd jobs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted them to know how to operate the business someday,"
Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   People also knew Gita for her cooking skills, especially her
talent for spicy curry chicken, Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   She had gone home to India recently to visit family, but returned
on Friday and went to the Universal motel to show off building
expansion plans to employees.</TE>
<TE>   He said he spoke to his sister Saturday and she seemed in high
spirits. "She was just so good-hearted," Patel said.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said Paras Kumar was a college freshman studying
business and doing well at it. His sister, Tulsi Kumar, attended
Reseda High School.</TE>
<TE>   Isaac Akironde, 16, a classmate, came by the Kumar home on Sunday
with another friend, Jimmy Castillejo, who sobbed as he sat nearby on
a curb.</TE>
<TE>   They recalled a girl who put others before herself at every
opportunity. "She'd always be there [for you]," Akironde said.</TE>

displaying documents that they said would formalize their secession
bid, in support of President Didier Ratsiraka.</LD>
<TE>   Marc Ravalomanana, mayor of the capital, Antananarivo, was
declared president by a court last Monday, but provincial governors
loyal to veteran leader Ratsiraka have not accepted the ruling.</TE>

<HD>Imprisoned Political Activist Freed in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Rights: He says he was not tortured, but the cells 'are
places for animals and not people.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Vladimiro Roca, a well-known Cuban political prisoner, was freed
early Sunday about two months short of completing his five-year
sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Back home in Havana, Roca told reporters, "I will continue my
political activism. I am not thinking about abandoning the struggle."</LD>
<LD>   Roca likened the government's long-term ideological campaign,
aimed at engaging citizens in current affairs through rallies and
political talk shows, to the "bread and circus" tactics of Roman
rulers.</LD>
<TE>   "When there was no bread, they had to give them more circus," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Roca, 59, had been serving a five-year sedition sentence in Ariza,
in the central province of Cienfuegos, that was scheduled to end July
16.</TE>
<TE>   Roca said he suffered no physical torture during his imprisonment
but that the cells he was held in "are places for animals and not
people."</TE>
<TE>   The son of the late Communist Party leader Blas Roca, Vladimiro
Roca is a former fighter pilot who broke from Cuba's socialist system
a decade ago and began calling for a Western-style democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Roca and three other activists were arrested in July 1997 for
publishing a document that criticized Cuba's Communist Party and
Fidel Castro's government. When they were sentenced in 1999, Roca
received the longest sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The other three activists--engineer Felix Bonne Carcasses,
attorney Rene Gomez Manzano and economist Marta Beatriz Roque--were
released in May 2000 after serving about half their terms.</TE>
<TE>   Roca's release comes one week before former President Carter
arrives in Cuba for a five-day visit.</TE>
<TE>   Some saw the move as a goodwill gesture by Cuba's Communist
government toward Carter, who has emphasized the importance of human
rights during his life of public service.</TE>
<TE>   Spain, Canada, the Vatican and others in past years have asked the
Cuban government to release Roca.</TE>

<HD>This Hungarian Horror House Is All Too Real</HD>
<DH>History: New museum, which was once an interrogation and
torture center, shows the brutality of pro-Nazi and Communist
regimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Nothing she learned in school prepared university student Aniko
Istvan for the experience of visiting a new museum here called the
House of Terror, dedicated primarily to recounting the brutality of
Communist rule.</LD>
<LD>   "Many people think about whether it's good to recall this horrible
period, but I think yes," Istvan, 23, said after touring the elegant
mansion that was used as an interrogation and torture center, first
by the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party and then by Communist secret police
in this former Soviet bloc country.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I can step forward in my life if I know what happened in
the past 50 years," she said. "I think this house describes that
period more accurately than what I learned at the university."</LD>
<TE>   Despite its blunt name--which to some might sound like an
amusement park "horror house" or imply a relentlessly heavy-handed
approach to displays--the feeling upon entering the building is that
of a somber memorial. Funereal music plays, candles are set out in
memory of victims, and a softly crying man on a video screen
declares, "We can forgive them, but we can't forget it."</TE>
<TE>   The central hall displays a Soviet tank, with the walls beside it
covered by 3,600 photographs of victims who suffered or died under
Nazi or Communist terror, not necessarily in this building.</TE>
<TE>   Basement Cells Have</TE>
<TE>   the Greatest Impact</TE>
<TE>   For many visitors, the highest-impact part of the museum is the
basement, where various types of cells have been reconstructed,
including one so small that the prisoner couldn't even lie down, and
another with water on the floor, so the prisoner was always wet. On a
desk in one room are simple electric tools for torture by shocking or
burning.</TE>
<TE>   In some other parts of the museum, there was no need for
reconstruction. One room, which has fearsome-looking clubs hanging on
the wall, is a "real place where people were tortured," said Bertalan
Havasi, a museum spokesman. "Sometimes victims remember, 'This was my
cell.'"</TE>
<TE>   Much of the power of the museum comes from the fact that so much
suffering took place within its walls.</TE>
<TE>   Ferenc Barbicz, 78, looked somber yet fully composed after
finishing a tour. But when asked his reaction to the displays, tears
welled in his eyes, he held up three fingers and struggled to speak.
"Three of my friends suffered here," he finally said. "Under
communism. I'm looking for names, from 1947 and 1948."</TE>
<TE>   An elderly woman declined to say anything after her tour except,
"I'm so shocked, I wouldn't like to talk now."</TE>
<TE>   "Some members of her family were here," her husband explained
after she walked away.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, everything became public that was forbidden to think
about before," said another visitor, Lukits Bela, 80. "All the
sufferings and problems of the country are concentrated in one place
now. I saw most of it myself. We mustn't forget, because it's a part
of history, and everything that belongs to Hungarian history
shouldn't be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Large sections of the museum take a strongly historical approach,
often using old films.</TE>
<TE>   The first exhibits examine the brutal 1944-45 period of Nazi
occupation and puppet rule by the Arrow Cross Party. Hungary was an
ally of Germany from the start of World War II but maintained some
independence until 1944, when direct Nazi control brought a sharp
increase in terror and the deportation to death camps of most
Hungarian Jews.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet Red Army forced the Nazis out of Hungary in 1945. With
Soviet support, Hungarian Communists gradually seized dictatorial
power over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Key to that effort was Communist control of the state security
police under Peter Gabor, who had his office in what is now the
museum.</TE>
<TE>   Walls Stir Memories</TE>
<TE>   of Prisoner Rail Cars</TE>
<TE>   One long, narrow exhibition hall has wood-slat walls meant to
recall the railway cars used to ship prisoners to forced labor in the
Soviet Union. Another room shows a Communist propaganda film on the
trial of Imre Nagy and other leaders of Hungary's 1956 democratic
revolution, which was crushed by Soviet forces.</TE>
<TE>   There also are displays of colorful propaganda posters depicting
both political themes and consumer goods, while another room shows
equipment used for wiretapping.</TE>
<TE>   The museum employs a film crew, a psychologist, 11 full-time
historians and 25 outside historians. A key part of their work is to
conduct filmed interviews with victims, to be added to the archives,
said research director Gabor Kiszely.</TE>
<TE>   "The museum tries to make an obstacle in the way of recurrence of
the two most horrible dictatorships that occurred here," Kiszely
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the facility is controlled by a public foundation, the
creation and running of the museum have been funded by the
center-right government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Some suspect
that Orban's interest was motivated in part by a desire to discredit
the rival Hungarian Socialist Party. That party, which led a
center-left coalition to victory in recent parliamentary elections,
was formed in late 1989 out of the old Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   One exhibit plays a video of Orban's speech at the museum's
opening. In it, he declares, "We have to tell our children that both
dictatorships were systems forced on us by foreign armies."</TE>
<TE>   Museum Gives</TE>
<TE>   'Objective Background'</TE>
<TE>   Kiszely said the museum has no political overtones but rather
gives "objective background and information." He, however,
acknowledged some concern that the incoming Socialist-led government
might try to cut off funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very good international connections all over Europe,"
Kiszely said. "Similar institutions aren't closed down. If such a
thing were to happen, that the Socialist Party wants to close down
our museum, then I think that our good friends and colleagues abroad
would raise their voices."</TE>
<TE>   Gyorgy Temesszentandrasi, 30, a physician, said after touring the
exhibits that he "was kind of crying all the way."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect such emotions," he said. "We stepped into a place
where in reality all these things happened." One gets the feeling
that you "can smell ... the blood on the wall," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After her tour, university student Istvan spent time using a
museum computer to look at additional information but said she still
felt shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shivering," she said. "When I go outside, I'll be happy the
sun is shining on me and I can breathe the clean air."</TE>

<HD>Jet Crash Death Toll Rises to 148</HD>
<DH>Nigeria: Workers remove bodies from the wreckage. Four
people survived the impact.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KANO, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Exhausted rescuers dragged the remains of at least 148 people from
the smoldering wreckage of an airliner that slammed into a crowded
city suburb in northern Nigeria, the local Red Cross said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   President Olusegun Obasanjo declared two days of national mourning
Sunday, a day after the twin-engine jet struck a poor suburb of Kano
after takeoff.</LD>
<LD>   Three passengers and one crew member survived the crash, carrier
EAS Airlines said.</LD>
<TE>   A chief nurse at a main city hospital said one of those aboard the
plane was only lightly injured. The other three were in serious
condition, she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The Nigerian Red Cross said the death toll of those killed on the
plane and on the ground was at least 148 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "As of this afternoon, 104 bodies were evacuated to the Murtala
Muhammed Hospital, 42 to the Kano State Specialist Hospital and two
to the army specialist hospital," Red Cross spokesman Patrick Bawa
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Nigeria's worst air disaster in more than five years.</TE>
<TE>   The dead included dozens of residents killed when the plane
crashed into about 10 buildings, including a school and at least one
mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-one passengers and eight crew members were on board the
aircraft, which was flying from the city of Jos to the commercial
capital, Lagos, via Kano, EAS said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said the jet "wobbled" soon after takeoff from Kano's
airport Saturday afternoon, bound for Lagos, about 500 miles

<HD>Venezuelan President Shakes Up His Cabinet</HD>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>President Hugo Chavez replaced four Cabinet members Sunday in a
shake-up aimed at yielding to opposition demands and restoring
stability after a failed coup.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez sacked Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, whose leftist
policies were largely blamed for eroding confidence in Venezuela's
oil-dependent economy. Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin,
whose reported ties with Colombian Marxist rebels had upset the armed
forces, also was fired.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez, ousted April 12 and back in power two days later, made his
decisions as part of an effort to subdue growing civilian and
military opposition to his rule.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez replaced Giordani with leftist economist Felipe Perez and
named another leftist economist, Tobias Nobrega, as finance minister,
the sixth person to hold the post since Chavez's 1998 election.</TE>
<TE>   Perez and Nobrega are considered more moderate than Giordani. Last
week, investment banking house Bear Stearns said Perez's appointment
would "send a positive signal to the markets."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez replaced Rodriguez with Diosdado Cabello, currently vice
president. Chavez announced last week that Jose Vicente Rangel would
be shifted from defense minister to vice president. The new defense
minister, Chavez announced, is army Gen. Lucas Romero Rincon,
Venezuela's highest-ranking military officer.</TE>
<TE>   The general's appointment comes despite his role in the failed
coup. Romero, who is inspector general of the armed forces, joined
other top generals in pressuring Chavez to resign after a bloody
anti-government demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   After Chavez's return to power, the general explained that he had
urged the president to give in to rebellious military officers to
avoid sparking a civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said he has accepted the explanation.</TE>

<HD>A Longer Workday Is Price of Peace</HD>
<DH>Economy: Afghans return to 8-4 schedule with a 55-cent
lunch stipend and a sense of patriotic duty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>If there is one capitalist reality that Afghans have learned in these
days of peace after more than two decades of communism and chaos,
it's that there is no such thing as a free lunch.</LD>
<LD>   That's why there was little grousing Sunday when the government
summarily extended the official workday from five hours to eight. The
longer day includes a paid lunch hour, putting more money in every
employee's pocket.</LD>
<LD>   With workloads increasing daily as the wheels of state creak back
into motion, the 600,000 Afghans restored to the government payroll
since December appear to be taking in stride what constitutes a 40%
increase in their working hours for a 55-cent daily wage hike.</LD>
<TE>   For workers whose monthly earnings average about $33, the extra 55
cents will be a princely sum.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy about the extra pay, so if it means I have to work
longer, so be it," said Gul Jan, a 35-year-old clerk at Kabul's city
government headquarters whose monthly income is jumping from $29 to
$46.</TE>
<TE>   The lengthened workday was decreed just Thursday, the last day of
the workweek in Islamic countries, catching many government employees
by surprise. Only those with access to television or radio learned
over the weekend that the day now runs from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., instead
of 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear to the whole world that we have a lot to do to lift
ourselves out of this mess," said Fazil Ahmed Zakeri, deputy minister
for social affairs. "By restoring a normal workday, we should be able
to boost productivity and get on with the business of rebuilding the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Although such an edict might foment a labor revolution in many
parts of the world, Afghans who work for the state remain conscious
of the disorder and poverty still afflicting much of their homeland.
Most regard the new workday as an economic necessity and a patriotic
duty.</TE>
<TE>   "We were way behind in our record-keeping after the Taliban
destroyed everything, and we weren't able to get everything done in
just five hours a day," said Abdul Saboor, manager of the payroll
accounting department for the Kabul municipal government. "We were
always hurrying in our work, which led to mistakes, so now that we
have afternoons as well, we should be able to work more efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of his colleagues, Saboor considers the extra 55 cents,
technically called a lunch stipend, poor recompense for having to
stay in the office until 4p.m. He pointed out that the extra income
will be nullified by higher costs for commuting home at rush hour,
when taxis and private buses charge steeper fares. But he views the
extension as a burden that each worker must shoulder without
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The interim government would pay us more if it had the money, but
it doesn't," Saboor said. "We all have to do our part."</TE>
<TE>   Afghan government and office workers used to put in an 8-to-4 day
in the relatively stable years when Mohammad Zaher Shah reigned, and
even after the 1979 Soviet invasion, when a free workplace lunch was
added by Moscow's central planners.</TE>
<TE>   That practice persisted through 1992, when the moujahedeen
government ousted communist President Najibullah and the bloody
infighting that eventually allowed the Taliban to seize power began
taking its toll on finances as well as stability. The workday was cut
to five hours so the government could reduce costs by sending workers
home in time for the midday meal.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, no one here has had any experience with
brown-bagging.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll fetch something from the bazaar today, but from now on, I
guess we'll bring something from home," said Fauzia Nuri, a typist in
the city accounting department who relies on her $37 monthly salary
to provide for herself, her unemployed husband and eight children. At
lunchtime Sunday, she and half a dozen colleagues chipped in about 25
cents each and sent someone for paprika-coated french fries and
flatbread.</TE>
<TE>   Ruhullah Wahadi, a 26-year-old ticketing agent for the state-owned
Ariana Airlines, said he wouldn't be caught dead carrying a lunch
box.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing and undignified," insisted the bachelor, who
supports his widowed mother and 15-year-old sister. "I'll go hungry
if they don't open a cafeteria here."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the larger state ministries and offices are pondering
restoring in-house cafeterias, both to create more jobs and to offer
convenient and more hygienic alternatives to the greasy fare peddled
from dingy pushcarts usually parked over open sewers.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's new lunch rush was a boon for food vendors such as Abdul
Khaleq, who parked his charcoal-fired hot plate outside the main city
administration building to serve hungry office workers a calzone-like
dish called bulani. He calculated that he would more than double his
usual daily earnings of about $2.</TE>
<TE>   The hardship of a longer workday will fall disproportionately on
employed women, who continue to shoulder the entire domestic load in
this patriarchal society.</TE>
<TE>   Most married female office workers must clean the house and cook
the evening meal once they get home, even if their husbands are
jobless.</TE>
<TE>   Those with working spouses also face complications.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband works in security and doesn't get home until 10 p.m.,
so there is no one who can watch our three children after school,"
said Freba Seconderi, a department head at the National Bank of
Afghanistan. "The extra money is nice, but it's not such a big
increase if you consider what we have to spend for lunch and
rush-hour transportation."</TE>
<TE>   The 55-cent wage hikes will cost the government $350,000 a day,
but the added labor should more than compensate for the expenditure,
said Deputy Finance Minister Gholan Nabi Farahi.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people know how much has to be done to get the economy
moving, and they are willing to do more," he said, adding that the
longer workday is unlikely to be the last sacrifice asked of Afghans.</TE>
