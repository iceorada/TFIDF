<LD>To those who have wondered whatever became of David Lehrer, I bring
good news. He's back.</LD>
<LD>   I am speaking metaphorically here. Lehrer actually never left
town, but was booted unceremoniously from his position as West Coast
regional director of the Anti-Defamation League.</LD>
<LD>   When I say he's back, it is in a somewhat different form, but with
the same altruistic aim. He wants us all to get along.</LD>
<TE>   The booting was done three months ago by national ADL director
Abraham Foxman, or "Abominable Abe," as he is known in certain
Southern California circles.</TE>
<TE>   Lehrer had been regional director of the Los Angeles-based unit
for 16 years and one of its executives for 27. His knowledge of
racist activities and organizations was phenomenal, and he didn't
hesitate to speak out against them.</TE>
<TE>   In dismissing him, Foxman, whose office is in New York, offered
the kind of vague language television executives employ in firing a
person they fear, something about strengthening the unit over which
the fired person held sway. Efforts to reach Foxman and ask him to be
more specific about his motivations failed. He is well-protected by
his staff. I believe the real reason for the dismissal was Foxman's
oversized ego and Lehrer's willingness to challenge his policies. The
truth is, the ADL unit here didn't need strengthening.</TE>
<TE>   To say that many of the 600,000 members of the L.A.-area Jewish
community were stunned and angered by the firing is to belittle a
rage that caused buildings to sway from Beverly Hills to Miami. Had
Abominable Abe set foot in the city during the outpouring of fury,
tarring and feathering might have made a notable comeback.</TE>
<TE>   I've known Lehrer since the mid-1970s, when I was assigned to
monitor the activities of racist organizations across the U.S., among
them the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and all of their vile
little brothers in malice.</TE>
<TE>   He knew who their leaders were and how to find them. He knew of
the rise of the sweet-talking "new" Klansman David Duke before anyone
else, the danger of demented neo-Nazis like Chicago's Frank Collin
and the bellowing demagoguery of old-time, freewheeling white
supremacists like San Diego's Tom Metzger.</TE>
<TE>   When the Internet became available, Lehrer was quick to warn of
its use by hate groups and the influence these groups were exerting
over the young, encouraging the racist violence of skinheads and
others of a similar bent.</TE>
<TE>   I relied on Lehrer's knowledge as I crossed the country
interviewing hatred's leaders. I stopped at the ADL's headquarters in
New York and quickly discovered how disorganized their hate-tracking
efforts were compared with the Lehrer-led L.A. unit.</TE>
<TE>   I was as surprised as everyone else when Foxman fired Lehrer. His
importance to multiethnic, racial and religious understanding cannot
be overstated.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, among his differences with Foxman were his 1998
efforts to forge a more civilized debate between Muslims and Jews in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts like that should be celebrated, not challenged, and should
never constitute a reason for punishment.</TE>
<TE>   But Lehrer isn't the kind of guy to cry into his pillow. He's
already busy creating a nonprofit institute geared toward making L.A.
a better place to live. He was born and raised here, and at 53, he's
lost none of his love for the city and none of the fire that
characterized his tenure with the ADL.</TE>
<TE>   Only the approach is different. Rather than tracking white
supremacists, he will attempt to fashion a common notion of
citizenship in L.A. He calls it "a creative sense of community, an
institute for common ground."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll deal with issues of tolerance," he said the other day over
bagels and coffee. "Our board will cut across racial, ethnic and
religious lines. Unlike New York, we don't walk on the streets
together. We're too big, too spread out. We need to develop a common
ground of a different kind."</TE>
<TE>   Chief among his aims, Lehrer said, is to enhance the idea of not
being hesitant to visit any community in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people at the ADL fearful of even driving through East
L.A. or South-Central. They thought they'd be carjacked at the next
corner. The truth is, crime is down and now is the time to see the
city, to go outside of one's own comfort zone."</TE>
<TE>   Basically, Lehrer envisions a town composed of people who are not
afraid of each other, with trust fostered through understanding. He
aims to accomplish this through training programs, seminars,
leadership workshops and use of the media, including radio and
television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take positions on issues and not be afraid to speak up," he
said, in what was probably a veiled reference to his dispute with
Foxman, who apparently disliked any opposition to his policies.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of the last century, the big push was to make tolerance
the mantra of America. Now we have to sublimate particular concerns
for the larger group."</TE>
<TE>   Bringing together diverse cultures into a single unit while
respecting their traditions won't be easy. L.A. has always resisted,
as Lehrer puts it, "walking together." He'll face heated debates
along the way and no small army of detractors, but if anyone can help
us see beyond the cultural barriers that divide us, Lehrer can.</TE>
<TE>   Without knowing it, old Abominable Abe, in feathering his own
throne, may have done us all a huge favor.</TE>

<LD>Behind her, drivers reach speeds close to 220 mph. The noise is
deafening but Elaine Irwin-Mellencamp doesn't seem to mind as she
dodges other race cars being dragged out to the track.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a real American landscape," says Irwin-Mellencamp about
race-car driving. "It's beautiful. Intoxicating."</LD>
<LD>   On a recent afternoon, Irwin-Mellencamp has come to California
Speedway in Fontana to watch drivers go through qualifying laps
before the next day's race. As she talks about her fascination with
the sport and the milieu of auto racing, Irwin-Mellencamp, a Ralph
Lauren and Victoria's Secret model, pauses to greet team members,
drivers and mechanics, offering each a straight look and a strong
handshake.</LD>
<TE>   As a spokeswoman for the Indy Racing League, Irwin-Mellencamp's
mission is to puncture the myth that Indy racing runs on
testosterone. For one thing, she points out, many women are involved
in the sport as drivers, mechanics and other support functions.
Drivers are not brash daredevils but rather focused athletes who
occasionally "cry before the event because it's so exciting," she
says. And, she stresses, pointing to a portable on-site kindergarten,
it's a family sport.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin-Mellencamp grew up with the sport, attending dirt-track
events with her father while growing up in Pennsylvania. Today, she
lives in Indiana, home of the Indianapolis 500, with her husband,
rock musician John Mellencamp, and their two children.</TE>
<TE>   After watching Janet Guthrie, Lyn St. James and Sarah Fisher, the
first women to compete in the famous race, Irwin-Mellencamp developed
a fascination with the sport. She became a spokeswoman for the league
last year, went through the Championship Auto Mechanics School and
rode in a pace car that reached 170 mph.</TE>
<TE>   But not in the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   Once she realized how much athleticism and concentration it takes
to drive the cars, "any dream of being a driver was dashed right
there," she says. "But I'm a great passenger."</TE>
<TE>   The Indy racing cars, which have about 650 horsepower and cost
close to $400,000 (a top-of-the-line Mercedes has between 350 and 400
horsepower and costs about $125,000), come within five inches of each
other as they fly around the track.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hair-raising," she says, flashing her model's smile.</TE>

<TE>   J.Lo Works Some Restaurant Mojo</TE>
<TE>   Actress-pop singer Jennifer Lopez has added yet another descriptor
to her name: restaurateur. About three months ago, she quietly leased
a space in Pasadena owned by Los Angeles chef and restaurateur
Joachim Splichal and his wife, Christine. The new eatery has been
christened Mojo.</TE>
<TE>   Splichal said he didn't seek out celebrity interest in his vacant
space. "It just happened that we had a few offers and the final
person was Jennifer Lopez," he said. "It's a long lease."</TE>
<TE>   The fashionable Granite Drive location has been shuttered for
about four years and used only for photo and movie shoots, Splichal
said. It is well-known as the former home to the Chronicle, an
old-style mahogany place with bar-and-leather booths that attracted
Pasadena's more affluent residents and thrived for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Splichal, who owns the Patina restaurants in Northern and Southern
California and Nevada, bought the spot in the mid-1990s and opened a
martini lounge there called Pinot at the Chronicle, but the bar
closed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Lopez's venture was granted a liquor license and City
Council approval. Arya Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based construction
company, is handling the restaurant renovations, and work is expected
to be completed in April. The bar and restaurant, which seats about
170, is poised for success, says Splichal: "It has a good identity,
good parking [and] it's close to an affluent neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   Publishing mogul Si Newhouse runs his Conde Nast magazines like a
movie studio, says GQ editor-in-chief Arthur Cooper in the April
issue of Earth Times magazine. "Think MGM in the 1930s, with Si as
Louis B. Mayer and the editors in chief as a galaxy of temperamental,
indulged, high-strung stars. You have [Vogue's] Anna Wintour as
Vivien Leigh, [Vanity Fair's] Graydon Carter as Mickey Rooney, and
me, well, as Clark Gable."</TE>

<LD>CHASING THE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE</LD>
<LD>   A Journey in Tocqueville's Footsteps Through Contemporary America</LD>
<LD>   By David Cohen</LD>
<TE>   Picador USA</TE>
<TE>   312 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   When French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville traveled through the
United States in 1831, he emerged with his classic work "Democracy in
America," in which he portrayed the young country as a society shaped
by its "equality of conditions." Now, in a book written 170 years
later, "Chasing the Red, White, and Blue: A Journey in Tocqueville's
Footsteps Through Contemporary America," journalist David Cohen
challenges some of his conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, an inquisitive foreign observer of the United States--he's
British and South African--was curious: How would Tocqueville's
observations stand up at the turn of a new millennium? He decided to
trace Tocqueville's route: to New York, the Midwest, the South and
Washington, D.C., but also added a stop in trendsetting California,
not part of the country in Tocqueville's day.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's book is a lively, easy-to-read piece of analytical
journalism, packed with anecdotes and statistics as well as
quotations from "Democracy in America" and Tocqueville's other
writings.</TE>
<TE>   In each chapter, he takes up a theme raised by
Tocqueville--religious observance, materialism, opportunity--and ties
it to the region he's visiting. Throughout, he hammers away at the
theme of social inequity, arguing that the United States is a country
with a growing gulf between its haves and have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   "But what if inequality of conditions--and not equality of
conditions--has become the defining 'creative element' of
contemporary American society?" Cohen asks, citing statistics that
show increasing wealth among the country's rich and increasing
difficulties for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen also set out to determine whether Americans still have the
compassion that Tocqueville found in his travels. He found it, but
only after reaching the country's nooks and crannies. "Maybe the
compassionate heart and egalitarian society that Tocqueville
described is alive and well, but you have to travel to the individual
cities and states--to the micro-nation--to find it," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen illustrates his quest with stories about the people he meets
along the way--from the New York prison guard who encounters many old
neighbors among his wards, to the cancer-stricken woman from Texas
who relies on her religious faith to keep going, to the philosophical
owner of a supermarket chain in the Ohio River Valley who puzzles
over the nature of American compassion. These interactions are cast
against the backdrop of the 2000 presidential campaign, featuring
George W. Bush's pitch for "compassionate conservatism."</TE>
<TE>   Multiculturalism is one of Cohen's dominant themes, and he ties it
in to his overall search. He stresses how diverse the American
population is today compared with its 1830s counterpart. In fact, on
arrival in the United States, he finds his portable radio tuned to
the thumping beat of a Latino station in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In the chapter on California, he discusses Latino immigrant
families and their roles in the state's economy--from migrant workers
to high-tech millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   And a topic through much of the book is the legacy of slavery--a
subject that clashes sharply with Tocqueville's 19th century concept
of an egalitarian society--and its impact today on African Americans
and the country as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Cohen, two of his chapters, on New York City and
Silicon Valley, have been overtaken by events since his visits,
rendering them historical rather than contemporary descriptions.
Cohen describes a New York humming with the vitality of moneymaking,
almost bursting with excitement as the market booms.</TE>
<TE>   And Cohen's California sojourn focuses in large part on Silicon
Valley, which he paints as the new American frontier, also spiraling
upward in an almost uncontrollable frenzy as its inhabitants seek
dotcom fortunes. In addition, his chapter on Washington, D.C., which
focuses on lobbyists, refers to the federal budget surplus, now
melted away.</TE>
<TE>   These portrayals seem almost poignant in the wake of Sept. 11,
with the downturn in the economy and the troubles facing the
technology industry. But Cohen succeeds in capturing the ethos of the
country as it sped into the new century.</TE>
<TE>   And what of his quest to search for the country's compassionate
heart? In the end, Cohen seems to find a mixed picture. He sees a
shift away from Tocqueville's egalitarian society. "It has become
harder and harder to grasp that if you win big, but those around you
lose big, you ultimately lose too," Cohen writes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he ends on a note of hope, discussing the American Dream with
a toll collector at New York's George Washington Bridge--a man
nicknamed "First Class," who thinks his own American Dream is "just
around the corner"--a fitting conclusion for a book that blends
exuberance with a cautionary note.</TE>

<HD>Devotion to a Car Goes the Distance</HD>
<DH>Some 20 years after production stopped, the durable
Checker's charm lasts for collectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS RUBIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if somebody made a car that was virtually indestructible, one
that could survive the mean streets of New York (and the potholes and
other dangers in all the major cities of the U.S.), the
less-than-perfect driving of cabbies from around the globe, and heavy
loads of passengers and luggage?</LD>
<LD>   Somebody did: Checker.</LD>
<LD>   From the first day of production in 1922 until the assembly line
in Kalamazoo, Mich., shut down in 1982, Checker created some of the
longest-running, most reliable cars ever manufactured in the United
States.</LD>
<TE>   Now, even 20 years after the last one was made, Joe Pollard has a
hard time containing his enthusiasm for the vehicles. "Checkers are
good for 1 million miles, with just a little maintenance," he says.
"They're incredibly durable--they'll run forever."</TE>
<TE>   And Pollard, 58, should know. Among collectors, he's known as "the
Checker King." He owns about 120 of the cars, with a dozen or more,
in various states of renovation, encircling his Chatsworth home. When
you see a Checker in the movies--and the movies love Checkers--often
as not, it's one of Pollard's.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for their bulbous, oversized taxi cabs, the company
also manufactured other models, including the massive Aerobus (an
eight-door airport shuttle model), a somewhat smaller four-door wagon
and the Marathon--the civilian version of the taxi, which debuted in
1960.</TE>
<TE>   Only 3,000 or so Checkers are still around, Pollard estimates, and
most are owned by collectors--very few are still in use as taxis. In
all of Southern California, there are only about 100 of the cars on
the road.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard's first contact with his beloved vehicle came on a trip to
the Bay Area in 1974. He was working as a session drummer at the
time, playing with the Beach Boys, Wilson Pickett and others, and was
met at the San Francisco airport by a musician friend driving a
Checker. When they went to load up gear, Pollard was impressed that
three passengers, a full drum kit and a Hammond organ all fit quite
comfortably. "Amazing," he says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The friend who owned the Checker referred Pollard to a Bay Area
dealer. There was a waiting list five years long, though, as the
dealer was only allotted two new cars each year. Pollard put his name
down, eventually purchasing a new Checker, in 1978, after another guy
on the list died while waiting.</TE>
<TE>   He sold the car in 1984. "I was driving on the 405 to meet a
friend," Pollard remembers, "when a guy waves me over and tells me he
wants to buy the car. I asked for a lot of money, and he said, 'OK.'"</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, who knew little about cars at the time, got double what
he had paid for the Checker, and figured he had just made a great
deal. "I thought I'd just get a new one," Pollard says a bit
wistfully. But it wasn't going to be that simple. "I found out the
factory had stopped making them."</TE>
<TE>   Checker rolled its last car off the assembly line in 1982. The
design of the classic Checker, which resembles a '55 Chevy, didn't
change significantly from 1960 to 1982. Even experts have to look
closely to figure out when one of these cars was made.</TE>
<TE>   New, the cars sold for $2,600 in 1960 and, by 1982, about $11,000.
Today, a fully restored vintage Checker brings from $25,000 to
$75,000.</TE>
<TE>   Why did Checker stop manufacturing such a classic car? "We
couldn't carry on," says Rod Walton, assistant to the president at
Checker Motors Corp. "It was no longer profitable to build the car.
[Environmental Protection Agency] and safety standards were difficult
for small manufacturers to meet, and the country was in a deep
recession, which hurt our sales." And the company found a better
niche: sheet metal stamping and sub-assembly for other car
makers--the business that continues today.</TE>
<TE>   Even if there would be no new Checkers, Pollard was virtually
addicted to the car for its reliability and spaciousness and he set
out to find another. A friend found a Checker wagon in a wrecking
yard in Duarte. The owner, tired of hunting for parts, was happy to
sell.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard drove out to see it, and left with it for $100. "I put in
a battery and gas, and it ran and ran." Which came as no surprise to
Pollard. "The cars originally came with a 250,000-mile warranty," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Later he would find and buy vehicle No. 1,982 out of a total run
of 2,000 from the final year of Checker production. A factory propane
model, it's very rare, and Pollard believes it is the last car off
the Checker line that's still around.</TE>
<TE>   It's also one of his daily driving vehicles--the other a Checker
wagon. (His wife drives a Saturn--the only other car besides that
long-ago Checker that Pollard ever bought new.)</TE>
<TE>   While Checker engines may last forever, many other parts don't. At
first, Pollard purchased another Checker to cannibalize for parts,
but that wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   A tinkerer by nature, Pollard started to make his own parts--like
windshield gaskets. It wasn't that much of a stretch, as he had
previously developed products in the world of music--drumheads and
sticks, cases used to haul instruments and gear, and electronic
drums.</TE>
<TE>   He began to offer Checker parts for sale on a word-of-mouth basis.
"I didn't yet know about the Checker Club of America," Pollard says
of the nationwide club of Checker enthusiasts. "I found the local
club and began to sell parts through it, and soon connected to the
national club."</TE>
<TE>   And once connected, he made an impression.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe has one of the largest collections in the country," says Bob
Welsh, president of Checker Car Club of America, Inc. "He's on the
board of directors [of the national club] and he's one of the leading
parts vendors on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard is the man people come to when they catch the Checker bug.
When John Baer, 45, a technical writer from Santa Cruz, wanted to
replace his 1956 panel truck, he searched the Internet--and ended up
at Pollard's door. "I wanted a utility vehicle," says Baer, a car
enthusiast who also owns a Volvo 850 for daily driving, "but not a
suburban utility vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   After finding Pollard on the Internet, Baer flew down and
purchased a Checker wagon, then drove it back to Santa Cruz the
following day.</TE>
<TE>   The exterior of the car was already restored, and Baer has been
working on the interior since he took it home. "Everyone on the
street loves it. People turn their heads. My girlfriend, though, is a
little sick of hearing me talk about it," Baer admits. "She has
declared her room a Checker-free zone. But, to me, Checkers rule!"</TE>
<TE>   Despite his considerable investment of time and money in the cars,
Pollard doesn't count on them for income. "Checkers are a hobby," he
says, "not a living."</TE>
<TE>   Pollard has owned a couple of hundred Checkers over the years. His
current collection of 120 sits mostly in the Mojave Desert, a
rust-free environment where airlines store their out-of-service
craft. While many of the cars are used for parts, about two dozen are
reserved for movie rentals.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard owns one of the cars featured in "Taxi Driver," Martin
Scorsese's 1976 film starring Robert De Niro. He purchased it from
Sylvester Stallone, who owned it when it was used in another film,
1984's "Rhinestone." Pollard's cars also appeared in the 2000 movie
"Almost Famous" and will be in Steven Spielberg's upcoming "Catch Me
If You Can."</TE>
<TE>   Angelenos who want to see a Checker up close can visit the
California Checker Club's show, held annually at the Los Angeles
County Arboretum in Arcadia on the last Sunday of July.</TE>
<TE>   Show organizer Kathryn Bassett, a former Checker cab driver for
San Gabriel Valley Cab, is loyal to the cars, even though her powder
blue Checker, nicknamed "Sherman," caught fire on the Foothill
Freeway years ago and has not yet been restored.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked on restoring it slowly for a few years, but it's not in
working order," Bassett says. "I will keep it forever, and I hope to
get it running again someday."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe with a little help from the Checker King.</TE>

<HD>Why Not Plant Some Blooming Azaleas?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spring bedding plants should be full flower, but you can fill any
vacancies in the garden with plants already in bloom at the nursery.
Or get an early start on summer bedding plants.</LD>
<LD>   Camellias and azaleas are in full bloom, so it's a good time to
shop and plant. Amend the soil with organic matter, and plant so the
top of the root ball is an inch higher than the surrounding ground.
Fertilize existing camellias now.</LD>
<LD>   As space opens up in the vegetable garden, you can plant a wide
variety of cool-season and warm-season crops. Select from beet,
cabbage, carrot, chayote, corn, endive, kale, leaf lettuce (and
European salad greens such as arugula and the mix called mesclun),
New Zealand spinach, onion, pea, potato, radish, sunflower, Swiss
chard and the early varieties of tomato, such as 'Early Girl'. Wait
until April or even May to plant main-crop varieties of tomatoes.</LD>
<TE>   Carefully guard new plantings from snails, which become more
active as weather warms. Don't wait a day to put down bait or
deterrents around tender new plantings. And be ready for "rose
slugs," actually the slug-shaped larvae of sawflies, which pepper
rose leaves with tiny holes. Caught early in the year, they are
easily controlled with a spray of light horticultural oil (such as
SunSpray).</TE>
<TE>   Cymbidiums seldom need dividing and seem to do best when crowded
into their pots, but if they didn't do well this winter, now is the
time to divide and repot them.</TE>

<LD>Do your parents wear a wedding ring or a high school or college ring?
These sentimental rings often have gemstones. A gemstone is any
precious or semiprecious mineral that is hard enough to be worn as
jewelry.</LD>
<LD>   Because of their beauty and rareness, many cultures believed
gemstones held supernatural powers and made them the subjects of
legendary myths and folklore. The ancient Greeks believed gemstones
were pieces of stars that had fallen to Earth. They also believed
they were the tears of the gods.</LD>
<LD>   Many ancient cultures believed garnets had the ability to increase
fire and illuminate the dark sky. In addition, various Native
American and South American tribes have used garnets to heal those
sick from fever, jaundice and even nightmares.</LD>
<TE>   Amethyst is a purple stone the Greeks believed had healing powers.
They also thought the stone protected them from the intoxicating
effects of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Emeralds are another stone cherished for their healing powers, in
particular for restoring poor eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient Roman scholar Pliny believed emeralds helped his tired
eyes, and the Roman Emperor Nero was said to wear emerald sunglasses
while watching gladiator fights.</TE>
<TE>   Today, people attribute a variety of qualities to diamonds:
strength, wealth, beauty, purity and love. The word "diamond" comes
from the Greek word "adamas," which translates into "unconquerable."</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about gemstones in the exhibit "Gems! The Art and
Nature of Precious Stones," on display at the Bowers Museum through
Sept. 1. For more information, call (714) 567-3600 or visit

<HD>Waking Up to Luxury</HD>
<DH>Americans have developed a taste for upscale bed linens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creating a luxury bed used to mean buying some designer percale
sheets, a fluffy comforter, a few pillows, and calling it a night.
Only royalty and the super-rich could afford to sleep between the
finest cotton satiny sheets.</LD>
<LD>   No more. An increasing desire for special and different bed linens
has spawned new levels of top-quality sheets in a range of prices.
Choices have greatly expanded for those with lofty budgets, with fine
linen companies offering more collections and hiring designers to
produce new looks in bold colors and contemporary prints.</LD>
<LD>   The surge in popularity of luxury bed linens started about a
decade ago, in step with an intensified interest in home furnishings.
According to Jerri Koplowitz, luxury linen buyer for Macy's West, the
category has expanded to include higher thread counts and jacquards
that create a tone-on-tone pattern via the weave. Extravagant,
imported textiles have fostered a whole new lexicon for American
shoppers who want to indulge themselves while they sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Long-established European brands such as Pratesi, Yves Delorme,
Porthault and Frette that once catered mostly to royals and the
extremely wealthy now make their wares available in boutiques
worldwide, and terms such as "thread count," "sateen weave" and
"double hemstitch" trip off the tongues of people who once never
thought beyond flat and fitted.</TE>
<TE>   Interior designer Charles Allem describes his nightly dip into
Pratesi this way: "I jump onto those pillows and hear the crackle of
the starch, and it's the most wonderful feeling after a tortuous day
at the office. I feel like a prince."</TE>
<TE>   For those with bottomless bank accounts, there are sets that
retail for more than $1,000. The 111-year-old Italian linen company
Sferra Bros.' Mellissimo line boasts 1,020-thread-count cotton
sheets. One queen flat sheet retails for about $500, a king for $560.</TE>
<TE>   Frette, a 150-year-old company headquartered in Milan, now has a
Hotel line of 200-count, Egyptian cotton sheets that sells via the
Chambers bed and bath catalog, with queen sets going for $255 and
kings for $285. Macy's Charter Club label's hotel hemstitch
500-thread count, 100% cotton sheets sell for $140 for a queen flat
sheet and $175 for a king flat.</TE>
<TE>   Linens can also be customized. Most of the top French and Italian
companies are happy to work with individuals or interior designers to
create the perfect color or pattern to match wallpaper, a company
logo, or, in the case of a certain legendary actress, lavender eyes.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to sheets, cotton is the preferred fiber--Egyptian
cotton, to be precise, with longer filaments that produce softer
fabrics. Some collections also offer imported linen and silk. And
then there are the accessories--cashmere throws, duvets, fake fur
coverlets, down-filled pillows, all of which can extend the price tag
into the tens of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   A number of factors have converged to raise the bar on quality and
cost.</TE>
<TE>   "The bedroom has a much more important place in the home," says
Brooke Stoddard, style editor of House &amp; Garden magazine. "It's a
place of retreat, and with the hectic lifestyles that people lead,
we're turning beds into mini-retreats. Decorators are using the best
new luxury linens to decorate the room, as well as finding the right
lighting and the best beside table."</TE>
<TE>   Stoddard also credits designers such as Ralph Lauren in the late
'80s and Calvin Klein in the mid-'90s for bringing attention to the
bed with their fashionable collections. They "woke people up to the
idea of bed wardrobes when they saw what beautiful linens were
available. People realized that they could change their bed and have
fun with it and build a collection over time."</TE>
<TE>   Globe-trotting lifestyles have brought more people into fine
hotels, where they often have their first exposure to high-quality
linens. It used to be de rigueur for royals and old-money types to
bring along their favorite linens when they traveled, and there's a
small percentage who still do. But today, since most great hotels use
the finest linens, it's visitors who want to take those home.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a lot of success from our hospitality division," says
Filippo Arnaboldi, director of marketing for Frette, which has
supplied sheets to the Vatican. "People sleep in the sheets, and then
they really want this kind of product. This is the most important way
we're getting recognition in this country and all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Top hotels routinely get requests from clients to buy sheets like
those in which they've slept--sometimes along with the rest of the
bed, including the mattress, pillows and comforter. Some, such as the
Ritz Carlton Pasadena, sell sheet sets in their gift shops.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely believe that hotels play a part in educating the
public in terms of what's available in high-quality linens," says
Mary Shriver, director of public relations for the Four Seasons Hotel
in Los Angeles, where Frette sheets are used in its three most
exclusive suites. "It's one of the things that gives that dream
quality to staying at a luxury hotel."</TE>
<TE>   At the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, executive assistant
manager Ellis O'Connor says, "an awful lot of emphasis is placed on
the bed, and there's a lot of research that goes into creating a
complete bed set that's going to give someone an unbelievable night's
sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The hotel used to use Frette sheets in all its rooms until it
decided to have custom sheets made elsewhere, to offer something more
exclusive: "We wanted to have control over what the guest was
sleeping on," O'Connor says, "something that they couldn't get
anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Most sheet buyers will, at some point, deal with thread count,
which has become probably the single biggest boost to high-end
sheets. To fire up interest in bedding and give certain brands a more
exclusive cachet, some companies began boasting about their thread
count--literally, how many threads per inch of fabric. Consumers were
taught that higher thread counts denoted better quality, with a
250-count better than a 180-count sheet. But in Europe, thread counts
aren't even discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "What has ended up happening is that the consumer has become
locked into the thread-count thing," says Jo Ann Piccininni, director
of product development for Sferra Bros. In the final analysis, it's
also about the fineness of the yarn and where it comes from. It all
sounds minute, but it does make a difference. The problem is those
things are technical issues that don't translate to the customer very
well."</TE>
<TE>   Sferra hasn't been immune to the fascination with counting
threads. Last year, the company introduced its sateen weave
1,020-thread-count cotton sheets "because we found one of the mills
could make this fabrication, and the American market is looking for
the next best thing in terms of thread count," Piccininni says. "This
is the pinnacle of what luxury is all about. For us it was the icing
on the cake, and it gave us a lot of notoriety."</TE>
<TE>   At the luxury-linens level there is no shortage of snob appeal,
which is one reason they're so sought after.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful for people personally, and also for their egos,"
Allem says. "We live in an ego- and sexually driven society, so
people want to be in the most beautiful linens. It sounds
materialistic, but that's the market, that's the story. People like
to know they have beautiful things around them."</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Gale, manager of the Beverly Hills Frette store, says
"special installations" for their linens are not uncommon. "We'll
work with an interior designer, and when a bed is installed in a home
we'll go with our ironing board and iron the sheets. People want the
ultimate."</TE>
<TE>   The ironing factor may keep some potential buyers away from luxury
linens, although those able to pay such high prices probably won't be
doing the pressing themselves. Luxury sheet care shouldn't be
intimidating, say the experts, and ironing isn't required, although
to obtain the crispness fine linens are known for, it is recommended.
"The bed is no longer a separate entity in the room; it's a part of
it," Stoddard says. "If you like the soft palette on the walls, you
can have it in your sheets, too. The glamour boudoir look is very big
right now, and everyone is turning toward that lovely 1940s Hollywood
glamour and wanting a sexy bedroom. So we're seeing silks and
luscious satins, crystal lamps and mirrored furniture, a return of
elegance. I think people want to wake up feeling like a movie star.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like a good night's sleep in your own bed," she
says. "When you get home and crawl into your bed, that's the way you
know you're home. The importance of that will never change."</TE>

<HD>Ironing Linens Makes a Cotton Field of Dreams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've always believed a clear conscience and a good pillow constitute
the best formula for achieving quality relaxation. After a week of
listening to people tout the benefits of the Egyptian cotton and
smooth-as-silk weaves, I had to try them for myself.</LD>
<LD>   But I had miles to go before I slept. Expensive ironed sheets are
supposed to be the ultimate experience, so I took a queen set of
Frette Royal Collection ivory cotton sheets (sent by the
manufacturer, but which retail for a cool $480) and headed for the
washing machine. They went through a delicate cycle with Woolite and
a trip through the dryer on low heat.</LD>
<LD>   Most good linens can tolerate washing machines on delicate
settings with a mild soap such as Woolite--but companies suggest
avoiding detergents or bleach. Machine drying is fine for some types
of sheets, but they should not be allowed to get really crispy, since
overdrying can damage the fibers. Jerri Koplowitz, luxury bed linen
buyer for Macy's West, suggests removing sheets from the dryer when
they're between "fingertip damp and bone dry." They should be shaken
out, and, if not ironed, should be smoothed by hand before folding.</LD>
<TE>   "Cotton blooms when it's washed and dried," she adds, meaning that
the fibers expand over time, which softens the sheets and reduces
wrinkling. Of course, the sheets can be professionally laundered, but
that can get pricey.</TE>
<TE>   The ironing didn't daunt me, having grown up helping my mother
iron our family's all-cotton sheets, a task that sounds somewhat
Dickensian but was actually a pleasant ritual we shared on weekend
afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   Although I still use cotton sheets, I don't spend my weekends
ironing them anymore. But in the interest of journalistic inquiry, I
made an exception.</TE>
<TE>   I began with the flat sheet, an enormous, endless piece of fabric.
I started with one corner and began pressing ... and pressing, and
pressing. I finally reached the other end, turned the sheet around
and went back the other way. When I lifted it off the ironing board
there was a huge wrinkled mess in the middle that I hadn't even
touched. How I wished I had a mangle, that machine that hotels use to
press linens.</TE>
<TE>   I did my best to iron the rest of it, then attacked the pillow
shams. After half an hour and a sore back, I decided I could live
with an unironed fitted sheet.</TE>
<TE>   With great anticipation, I finally slipped into bed. The sheets
felt cool and crisp, the words I heard again and again to describe
freshly pressed cotton linens. Although they were not as hefty as the
cotton sheets I was used to sleeping in, their delicateness made them
softer and more luxurious. I slept extremely well.</TE>
<TE>   I'm definitely hooked, although I'm not quite in the league of
Sally Aminoff, a Beverly Hills real estate agent and Frette devotee
who describes her conversion this way: "It's the difference between
lumpfish and caviar. I've always been drawn to beautiful linens, the
sensuality of them. I love luxe. And luxury doesn't have to be
fattening if you have beautiful sheets."</TE>
<TE>   So, does she now consider them a luxury--or a necessity?</TE>
<TE>   "Necessity. They're definitely a necessity."</TE>

<HD>'Beauty Is in the Bulb'</HD>
<DH>Alison Berger takes inspiration from historical concepts to
re-create the soft glow of candlelight in contemporary fixtures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For someone whose raison d'etre is light, West Hollywood resident
Alison Berger's 1920s apartment/studio is apt, since it functions
almost as a prism. Floor-to-ceiling windows reflect and refract the
morning sunlight as naturally as the transparent crystal works she
designs. These include lighting fixtures as well as tableware; one of
her hanging fixtures is suspended in front of a floor-to-ceiling
window, its soft light a welcoming beacon, much like a candle burning
centuries ago for returning voyagers.</LD>
<LD>   "The medium I work with is light, and the materiality is glass,"
says Berger, 39. "I create objects that may have a historical basis.
For example, I look at 4th century Greek urns and synthesize them
down to their essence. It's almost like memory where you select
certain details from your own perception because that's what you like
to remember."</LD>
<LD>   Berger begins by asking herself how she can contain electric
candlelight. "In the Jewish religion, there's something called an
everlasting light. My lighting is really based on that notion, that
the lights are on all the time, that they're like candlelight. They
create tone and atmosphere, and while they can be turned up to be
quite bright and functional, they're really about something being at
home waiting for you, imparting feelings of calmness and serenity,"
says Berger.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Dallas, Berger has been intrigued by light since she was
very young, and has blown glass since she was 15. She has a bachelor
of fine arts degree from the Rhode Island School of Design and
trained as an architect at Columbia University School of
Architecture. She has worked with architect Frank Gehry as well as at
Bausman-Gill Associates, where as project designer she collaborated
on the award-winning corporate headquarters for Warner Bros. Records
in New York's Rockefeller Center.</TE>
<TE>   She's designed glass objects in the studio of artist Dale Chihuly,
for an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art and for Steuben
Glass, and has works in the Corning Museum's 20th century design
collection. She moved to Los Angeles 10 years ago to track the light
here and for the ease of using local craftsmen to manufacture her
designs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, no matter what Berger is doing, she is always looking at
light. "I ask, how is it contained, how is it held, how is it
reflected and refracted? There's a very illusionary, ephemeral
quality to glass," she says. And so her bell-jar-like glass shades
frame the lightbulb and become part of it.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who's taken the time to watch light rays color and
illuminate glass will understand her deceptively simple light
fixtures. All are blown freehand, and no two are completely alike.</TE>
<TE>   "The form is contained; it's stripped down to its essence. There's
not a big story because, to me, light is light. The beauty is in the
bulb and the subtlety of the light. It's very meditative," she says.
She has a line of five hanging lights and one floor lamp, all of
which take 60-watt bulbs, and can be dimmed as low as five watts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real struggle in what I do, in that I show the
indigenous quality of the material used, like the cords and bubbles
in the glass, which is what you see in old glass. I'm not
romanticizing the process and trying to re-create the past, but I'm
trying to do pieces that are about the material," Berger says. A
whimsical inspiration for her lights are the fireflies she used to
catch in glass jars when she was a child.</TE>
<TE>   The crystals in Berger's fixtures undulate and change as the light
hits them. The material is substantial and not perfect. "It wasn't
until machines made glass that it became thin like our drinking
glasses," she says. "I'm going back to the idea of glass being
special, which is why the aristocracy owned it, because it embodied
the rituals and culture of the times."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her lighting fixtures, Berger is working on a new
series of crystal tableware for Hermes, and she's in the process of
reinventing timepieces. "I'm working on a series of clocks that
project time, perhaps having a lens that would actually move to show
time passing. I'm working on a vessel where the watch face is
recessed inside the glass so on elevation you can't see it. The time
within it is reduced in scale so it's caught, almost like a fly in a
glass Victorian flycatcher."</TE>
<TE>   She laughingly calls it a therapy clock for people who want to
sneak peeks at the time without being seen.</TE>
<TE>   So Berger continues to experiment with light, glass and, now,
time. "How much do we have at home that has that contemplative,
home-waiting-for-you feeling?" she asks. "That's what I'm trying to
create."</TE>
<TE>   Berger's lighting fixtures are represented locally at Plug, 8017
Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. Prices range from $800 to more than
$8,000, depending on size.</TE>

<LD>Lightning again flashed and thunder rumbled. A huge cloud seemed to
burst open, and it emptied so much rain all at once that it went
right through Brownie's puffed-up feathers. Her chicks' baby feathers
were too new to shed the water and were getting wet. Poor Brownie was
terribly upset.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah's mother held her big umbrella over Brownie and said, "Now
everything is going to be all right. Sarah is here to help you."</LD>
<LD>   At first, Brownie didn't like Sarah taking her chicks away and
clucked loudly at her. "Please don't be mad at me," Sarah said.
"You'll get them back as soon as the rain stops."</LD>
<TE>   Because Brownie knew that Sarah was the little girl who lived in
the farmhouse and took care of the chickens every morning, she
stopped acting angry and raised herself up so that Sarah could take
the chicks from under her and put them into the basket. Then she
fluttered over the garden fence to a low bush where she could find
shelter until after the storm.</TE>
<TE>   Tucking the towel over the basket, Sarah and her mother started
back to the kitchen, watching out for slippery puddles on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah's mother put her umbrella by the kitchen door. "Let's put
the chicks in front of the fireplace to get warm," she said. So they
lifted the frightened little chicks out of the Easter basket and put
them down on the soft rug. They just huddled together. They didn't
even peep!</TE>
<TE>   Sarah sat watching as the chicks dried out and became fluffy and
yellow again. Pretty soon, they flapped their tiny wings and began
hopping around on the rug going "peep, peep, peep."</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden the room brightened. Sarah looked up and the sun
was shining through the kitchen window.</TE>

<LD>Last month's Grammy victories pushed the traditional bluegrass and
country sounds of the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack to the
top of the nation's album chart, but contemporary pop-rock acts have
recaptured the commercial momentum.</LD>
<LD>   The ninth volume of the "Now That's What I Call Music" series
entered the chart at No. 1 on Wednesday after selling 419,000 copies
in its first week in stores.</LD>
<LD>   The collection of recent hit singles by acts such as U2, Mary J.
Blige and Pink is a joint project of Universal Music Group, the EMI
Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Zomba Music. The eight earlier
volumes have sold more than 28 million copies combined since the
series was introduced four years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Among the hit singles featured on the ninth album: U2's "Stuck in
a Moment You Can't Get Out Of," Blige's "Family Affair," Pink's "Get
the Party Started" and Destiny's Child's "Emotion."</TE>
<TE>   "O Brother," which sold 132,000 copies last week, fell to No. 3 on
the chart, also trailing "The Best of Both Worlds," the Jay-Z/R.
Kelly collaboration that sold 223,000 its first week in stores.</TE>
<TE>   Two other albums also debuted in the top 10: R&amp;B singer Glenn
Lewis' "World Outside My Window" and Jimmy Buffett's "Far Side of the
World" finished No. 4 and No. 5, respectively. The latter was
released and distributed by Buffett's own Mailboat Records--a rare
top 10 collection that isn't distributed by one of the industry
conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the top 10 were claimed, in order, by
Alan Jackson, Linkin Park, Alanis Morissette, Ludacris and Pink. The
nation's best-selling single is 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>

<HD>What Was So Great About Dad Anyway?</HD>
<DH>A daughter of architect Glen Howard Small, whose ego hurt
his career, puts together the pieces of her estranged father's life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE BATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bad attitude has derailed many careers. Take the case of odd Los
Angeles architect Glen Howard Small, the subject of an award-winning
documentary, "My Father, the Genius."</LD>
<LD>   The film has no distributor or commercial release date in L.A.,
but it will screen tonight as part of the American Cinematheque's
Independent Film Showcase. Small was a young lion of Southern
California architecture in the early 1970s, influencing culture as
dynamically as Spielberg and Lucas did with their films. Small was
one of the seven founders of the Southern California Institute of
Architecture, or SCI-Arc, in 1972. His architectural visions were, in
keeping with that time, sweeping, abstract and ecologically friendly.</LD>
<LD>   His Biomorphic Biosphere Megastructure, Green Machine and Turf
Town concepts enthralled a generation of architecture students caught
up in burgeoning eco-activism movements. But while other founders Ray
Kappe and Thom Mayne went on to figure prominently in Los Angeles and
world architecture, Small's ego and questionable social communication
turned his career into a scrapbook of lost promise and his family
into strangers.</LD>
<TE>   Filmmaker Lucia Small is one of those strangers. Her relationship
with her career-obsessed father was distant at best when he
approached her more than a decade ago with the idea of writing his
biography. Small had left Lucia's mother for a younger woman in the
late 1960s when Lucia and her two sisters were very young. Her
memories of her father were of a weekends-only dad, and there was
admittedly some bitterness at his cavalier dumping of one family to
raise another one with his new wife. (Small eventually left that wife
too for another woman.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, the thought of learning more about the career of a father
who had always referred to himself as a genius intrigued Lucia Small.
Having racked up some production credits on PBS programs and
directing credits on video shorts, she told her father she would make
him the subject of her first feature documentary instead of writing a
biography.</TE>
<TE>   The idea apparently appealed to Small and "My Father the Genius"
was born. To Lucia Small's credit, the film is neither a fluff piece
for the architect or a bitter account of a wayward father. Instead,
she has used animation, archival footage, and extensive interviews
with family, friends, clients and former students to craft a
humorously disconcerting film that could be about anyone's father who
is more interested in fixing the world than connecting with his
family.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which has won awards at Slamdance and the New England
Film and Video Festival, is definitely not the biographical film Glen
Howard Small envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   "He likes it, I think," she said in a recent phone interview.
"He's proud that people are receiving it well. But he says there's
another film yet to be made about his career." For all his ups and
downs, Small retains his unbridled ego.</TE>
<TE>   The career that started so promisingly when Glen Small left an
assistant professor position at Cal Poly Pomona to help start SCI-Arc
wound up riddled with controversy. Lucia found former students who
spoke glowingly in the film about the young professor's zeal and
inspiration in those early years. Footage of Small and his students
erecting huge tent-like structures and riding around Los Angeles on
bicycles to show off their architectural art projects portray a
whimsy and freedom of spirit that permeated the late '60s and early
'70s. While many of Small's architectural projects were noble in
intent, they proved impossible to build. Beautiful, soaring drawings
look great on paper, but viability wasn't Small's specialty. Many
look like they belong in the Museum of Jurassic Technology.</TE>
<TE>   Interspersed with career footage are home movie clips showing
Small and his first wife and little daughters, sometimes building
makeshift structures at the beach using driftwood.</TE>
<TE>   "My father wasn't an ogre," Lucia Small said. "He did have a
family side to him. But my mother had been sold this bill of goods
that she would have this perfect marriage and family. Her American
dream was shattered"--by a husband who seems to have more than a
little difficulty with women.</TE>
<TE>   Lucia gets good comments from two ex-wives and an ex-girlfriend,
who speak mostly with more sad affection than malice. Ex-girlfriend
Jan Mardian laughs as she tells the camera that Glen's idea of a
perfect working situation would be a long worktable with a pretty
girl waiting at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Small, on the other hand, refers to women as "controlling and
yappy." Women seem to exist just to help him realize his artistic
vision. If this sounds like a Picasso or a Howard Roark (in Ayn
Rand's "The Fountainhead"), well, Small probably wouldn't disagree.</TE>
<TE>   By 1976, Small's self-absorption was becoming a problem. For one
thing, his peers did not always appreciate his sarcastic sense of
humor. In an amazing archival film clip, Small moderates a panel that
included some of current L.A.'s iconic architects. Small
systematically introduces members with snide comments, referring to
the now renowned Frank Gehry as "a hustler and opportunist." Small
thought he was being funny, but he was alienating his contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   As years went by, Small stepped on his families and contemporaries
in his quest to be himself. Like most egomaniacs, he was certain his
problems were always caused by others. "Face it, Glen," L.A. artist
John Harris says to Small in a scene in an L.A. bar. "You don't get
along with people. People just don't like you." Small laughs and
shakes his head.</TE>
<TE>   Small's career took the biggest hit when he was asked to leave
SCI-Arc in 1990. The founders had been guaranteed a position there
for life, so this came as a devastating shock. He has completed only
a few projects since then, including the Nelson house in Los Angeles,
an art gallery on the Oregon coast and a residence in Oregon. He has
lost his architectural clout, becoming an eccentric stop on the
Venice Art Walk. At 61, he was so broke he sent form letters to
friends and acquaintances to ask for funds to build the Oregon
residence with the intention of selling it, but after it was
completed, he moved into it himself.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 years that Lucia took to make the film, her feelings
evolved. As an adult, she is more forgiving of an artist whose
visions rarely made it beyond the drawing stage. "Architects are
practical artists, but they're also shaping cities," Lucia says, as
if to say practicality and vision make strange brain fellows. Her
father has achieved full-fledged curmudgeon status, but ironically,
he may get some recognition through his daughter's documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hard feelings about his behavior, Lucia and her
sisters seem to have turned out all right. Lucia has proved an adept
documentary filmmaker by exposing the underbelly of the architect.</TE>
<TE>   As for Glen Small, he kind of grows on you by the end of the film.
His uncompromising nature cost him a lot, but you also feel he hasn't
given up on that other film--the one about his career.</TE>
<TE>   "My Father, the Genius" (with two animated shorts) today, 7:30
p.m., Egyptian Theater, 6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. Admission:
$8; students and seniors, $7. Glen Howard Small will give a lecture
on Friday at 6 p.m. in the library at SCI-Arc, 960 E. 3rd St., Los
Angeles. It's sponsored by Cal Poly Pomona's graduate department.

<LD>   Want to second-guess the academy's choices for the short films?
See which of the nominated shorts you think deserved the Oscar during
screenings of the Academy Award Nominated Animated and Live-Action
Shorts. Apollo Cinema presents two separate programs--one for each
category--for three more weekends at Laemmle's Monica in Santa
Monica. In the animated category are the Irish films "Fifty Percent
Grey," by Ruairi Robinson and Seamus Byrne, and "Give Up Yer Aul
Sins," by Cathal Gaffney and Darragh O'Connell, as well as Ralph
Eggleston's Academy Award-winning "For the Birds" and Joseph E.
Meredith's "Stubble Trouble" from the U.S. and Cordell Baker's
"Strange Invaders" from Canada. The live-action program includes the
U.S. films "the accountant," for which Ray McKinnon and Lisa Blount
took home the Oscar, and Kalman Apple and Shameela Bakhsh's "Speed
for Thespians"; Virgil Widrich's "Copy Shop" from Austria; Johannes
Kiefer's "Gregor's Greatest Invention" from Germany; and "A Man
Thing" (Meska Sprawa), by Slawomir Fabicki and Bogumil Godfrejow of
Poland.</LD>

<TE>   You want eclectic? Just check the latest album from desert
denizens Giant Sand. On its CD "Cover Magazine," the veteran Tucson
band (with such guests as PJ Harvey and Kevin Salem) digs into a pile
of songs by artists ranging from Marty Robbins to Black Sabbath, X to
Sonny &amp; Cher. In addition to the Knitting Factory show, serious
Sand-maniacs also want to be on hand for frontman Howe Gelb's 2 p.m.
solo set at Amoeba Music in Hollywood.</TE>

<TE>   Even if Steven Spielberg and George Lucas excise all of the
objectionable parts (whips, guns, snakes, Nazis?) for the inevitable
DVD release, we will always have midnight movie screenings to enjoy
the original cut of the 1981 adventure "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The
action extravaganza--featuring comic-book-style hero Indiana Jones
(Harrison Ford)--combines the whiplash pace and wild cliffhangers of
Saturday-afternoon serials with the bigger-is-better blockbuster
mentality. Karen Allen plays Jones' feisty love interest, and Denholm
Elliott appears as a fussy academic. Spielberg directed and Lucas
produced, from a script by Lawrence Kasdan. And, of course, John
Williams provided the stirring title theme.</TE>

<TE>   While some Catholics celebrate the Blessing of the Animals in
October, during the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, at El Pueblo de
Los Angeles, the holiday used to be recognized on Jan. 17, the day
patron saint of the animal kingdom San Antonio de Abad died in AD
356. But bad weather--and who wants to take Fido out in a storm?--led
organizers to move the blessing to Holy Saturday, the day before
Easter. So put a leash on Fluffy and get in line behind the Holstein
cow to be blessed by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. The blessing is at 2
p.m., but the free family fun lasts all afternoon.</TE>

Small (See story, Page 38). The jury prize for short animation went
to "Better Life," director Atsuko Kubota's mix of watercolor, 3-D
computer space, models and animation. Tom Gibbons' adaptation of
Kafka's "The Hunger Artist," the winner of the audience award for
best short, uses stop-motion animation in bringing to life the story
of a man who takes fasting to the level of art.</TE>

<LD>The Camaro Club at the Viper Room continues to rock. On Monday,
veteran rocker Meat Loaf surprised everyone by jumping on stage with
Metal Shop and belting out Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name." Hot
dog! Squawked by the Copro Nason Gallery in Culver City on Saturday
for the closing of its colorful Paul Frank exhibit. Among the art
lovers in the house were Copro owner Greg Escalante, L.A.'s patron
saint of underground art....</LD>
<LD>   Man, everyone's still talking about the Toilet Boys performance at
the Key Club last week. For devotees of the New York band, it's like
seeing KISS in its prime. Smooch smooch.</LD>
<LD>   The Key Club tells me it's hosting the Warped Tour kickoff party
April 11 and the Vans Records launch party April 18, with a
performance by Too Rude--the new label's debut artist. (Too Rude also
plays the Roxy this Saturday).... Attention, savvy promoters: the
singer of the Deviates, Brian Barbara, says there are no venues for
bands to play in the South Bay, despite the strong music scene there.
He says bands and fans always have to schlep to Hollywood. Hmmm.
Sounds like opportunity knocking.... Save the date: On May 4, Frank
Black and the Catholics are coming to Hollywood's Knitting Factory,
which is happily becoming quite the home of super surprise shows.
Beck recently rocked the house.... Soul lovers can check out singer
Martin Luther on Saturday at Temple Bar in Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   This just in: Ima Robot rescheduled its Troubadour date to April 4
(the L.A. buzz band was originally scheduled for April 1).... Scene
fave the White Trash Debutantes are playing at the Coconut Teaszer on
Saturday....</TE>

<HD>Svrcek Answers Demands of 'Piano Study 3'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world premiere of Hyo-shin Na's "Piano Study 3" was a highlight
of Susan Svrcek's latest recital in the Piano Spheres series Tuesday
at Neighborhood Church in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   A commission by the enterprising organization, it is a technically
demanding piece for the instrumentalist, an intriguing one for the
listener. It lives in the treble regions of the instrument, visiting
the lower octaves seldom. It tinkles; it simulates Korean
instruments; it assumes a walking gait; it specializes in the
pentatonic mode, and it is repetitive--but both the mode and the
repetitions are charming rather than irritating, for the piece lasts
only eight minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The composer was present; she shared bows with the pianist.</LD>
<TE>   Another living composer, this one 35 years older than Na, was also
in the commodious sanctuary of the neo-Craftsman church. Benjamin
Lees wrote the two works, "Odyssey I" and "Odyssey II," that
constituted most of the first half of this recital.</TE>
<TE>   They are ballad-like pieces of considerable impact that contrast
gentle and warlike moods, rhapsodic and epic passages, and present a
succession of shared and urgent feelings. The musical narrative in
both is ongoing but not chaotic, and thoroughly compelling.</TE>
<TE>   These attractive pieces surrounded the quiet pairing of John
Cage's suave, entirely diatonic "Dream" (1948) and Debussy's final
solo piano piece, the meditative "Elegie" (1915). Svrcek played both
exquisitely, making at least one pianist in this audience of pianists
want to find these scores and play them--now.</TE>
<TE>   The program ended with two pieces of political reference by Yuji
Takahashi, "Kwangju, (May 1980)," a memorial to victims of the
Kwangju massacre, accompanied by projections of artwork by Taeko
Tomiyama, and "Chained Hands in Prayer" (1976), a set of variations
on a hymn attributed to Korean poet Ji-ha Kim, who was held prisoner
in the 1970s. Svrcek gave the entire program the title "Personal
Journeys."</TE>

<DH>In West Hollywood, this 'dive's dive' has quickly become a
haven for diverse scenesters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, there's nothing like a dive. The kind of spot where you
come as you are, the jukebox plays all your favorite songs and the
guy at the bar's seen better days. Sheryl Crow sang about it so
perfectly in that boozy gem "All I Wanna Do."</LD>
<LD>   The Parlour Club, a new joint on Santa Monica Boulevard, was
created out of the ashes of an old hustler bar called the Pub, a
sketchy dive in West Hollywood that had surely seen better days. But
Lenny Young, a film producer turned barkeep, saw potential in the
place and doggedly pursued its owner to sell the bar to him.</LD>
<LD>   With the 3-month-old Parlour, Young created a "dive's" dive--a
bordello-red bar with lo-fi whimsy that's a new hit on the stretch of
Santa Monica that already includes such happening spots as the
Lounge, Belly and Sky Sushi. Young, whose producing credits include
"Chicken Run," "James and the Giant Peach" and "Snow in August," had
lucked out in San Francisco with a bar called the Attic, a Mission
District underperformer he transformed into a community staple by
making it a forum for spoken-word and neighborhood events.</LD>
<TE>   He's working the same angle at the Parlour, and it's already
having an impact. In just two months, the Parlour has evolved into an
art house of sorts. As befits the neighborhood, the Parlour is a
haven for spoken word, rock 'n' roll, gay, fetish and mod scenes. And
its one of the few WeHo bars that's attracting Eastsiders--no small
feat.</TE>
<TE>   Its wide appeal has a lot to do with its comfort factor. The
Parlour is roomy and long, with a backroom stuffed with cushy
furniture and cool images. Artist Dame Darcy painted surreal
portraits on the red walls, and battered chandeliers hang from the
ceiling. A cozy nook to the left of the entrance is shrouded by
velvet curtains, a good touch in any club.</TE>
<TE>   Its jukebox, however, is pure genius. It's rare to find everything
from ABBA to Black Sabbath on a jukebox, but the Parlour Club
provides it all. On a recent night, it produced everything from
Johnny Cash to Hole, with doses of the Runaways and Screamin' Jay
Hawkins for good measure. Closer scrutiny revealed cuts by Billie
Holliday and the Pixies.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday nights, the bar transforms into Miss Kitty's Parlour, a
fetish-rock club. On Saturdays, DJ Oscar provides a night of "electro
deviant punk pop," and the Parlour fills up with an interesting crowd
of Hollywood and Silver Lake hipsters. Beginning next Thursday, the
Parlour is launching a lesbian night with the debut of "U-Haul,"
which is hosted by DJ Big Mama Freak spinning rock, funk and oldies.</TE>
<TE>   One of its quickest successes has been on Sundays between 6 and 9
p.m., when performance artist Lydia Lunch and promoter Andrew Gould
host the "Unhappy Hour," a spoken word series that's created a big
underground buzz. Regulars include author Clint Catalyst, whose
"Cottonmouth Kisses" topped Amazon's bestseller list for Gay &amp;
Lesbian books. (This Sunday, singer Jake LaBotz is the featured
guest.) The spoken-word forum has been a key draw for many musicians
and artists, who pack the place each Sunday to speak their mind or
hear others speak theirs. Afterward, the Parlour Club becomes Dada, a
new-wave cabaret hosted by a variety of scene queens and filled out
by DJ Philippe Kane.</TE>
<TE>   So like the song says, if all you wanna do is have some fun until
the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard, the Parlour's bound to
be your kind of place.</TE>

<HD>In Torrance, a Door to Japan</HD>
<DH>I-naba's spare, stylish decor includes bamboo shades and
dainty flowers; add cuisine of sashimi and tempura to evoke the land
of its inspiration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The minute I cross the threshold at I-naba, I'm overcome by deja vu.
In a Torrance mini-mall, I feel as if I've walked into a restaurant
in a small Japanese town.</LD>
<LD>   It's a stylish place of dainty flower arrangements, slanted
mirrors and mustard-yellow tablecloths. Delicate bamboo shades shield
the windows. All you hear is hushed conversation and faint music--at
least when the sizzling deep fryer momentarily falls silent.</LD>
<LD>   This spare dining room is not the only place to eat here, though.
Hidden by curtains is a private tempura bar for customers who
advance-order lavish yorokobi-an dinners.</LD>
<TE>   Slightly worn blue curtains hang above the main kitchen, but not
so low as to hide what the chefs are doing. Mostly, they are frying.</TE>
<TE>   I-naba serves a wide range of hot and cold Japanese dishes as well
as the obligatory sashimi first course for those with more to spend.
But crisp, clean-tasting tempura is the main event here. It comes in
elegant, complex set menus; you're supposed to work your way into
tempura gradually (rarely, if ever, will you see a Japanese diner
plunging directly into a fried food course).</TE>
<TE>   Tempura gozen ($30) starts with perfectly cut sashimi of tuna,
yellowtail, white fish, geoduck and octopus, followed by a green
salad tossed with a ginger vinaigrette. You also get a bowl of miso
soup and a dish of chawan-mushi (a custard stocked with ginkgo nuts,
shiitake, shrimp and fish).</TE>
<TE>   Then, and only then, comes some of the best tempura anywhere
outside Japan. First, three long shrimp, tails pointing skyward,
flanked by two pieces of boned sole. These are followed by a plate of
batter-fried green beans, eggplant, onion, pumpkin and a hot pepper
stuffed with a little ground beef.</TE>
<TE>   On the side, there is a dipping sauce laced with grated white
radish. Steamed short-grain Japanese rice is served in a covered
bowl. There are also salty homemade pickles (tsukemono) cured in rice
wine with rock salt and basil. Expect to find tiny slices of
cucumber, yellow radish and, if you're lucky, purple basil.</TE>
<TE>   There are options. Shrimp tempura gozen ($22) gets you some of the
sashimi, no custard and fewer pieces of tempura. An assorted tempura
course ($40), the largest of the tempura set menus, adds a second
wave of tempura, cold soba noodles and an unexpected dessert, such as
New York cheesecake.</TE>
<TE>   Still, tempura isn't all I-naba serves. One entire page of the
menu is devoted to fried buckwheat noodles (soba) with toppings, cold
with dipping sauce or hot in dashi, the familiar Japanese broth of
dried bonito. There are bento dinner boxes, pressed sushi dinners and
a variety of wonderful appetizers, a few of which have surprising
touches.</TE>
<TE>   I-naba is proud that it makes its soba by hand. My favorite way to
eat it here is ten-seiro ($9.50), for which the noodles are served
cold on a wickerwork bamboo plate alongside a bowl of hot broth
crowned with kaki-age, a deep-fried patty of chopped seafood and
vegetables in tempura batter.</TE>
<TE>   The appetizer menu deserves notice. Washu-gyu is a clone of the
incomparably tender Kobe beef raised in Oregon. It's cut into
bite-sized chunks, broiled and served with dipping sauce. Oddly, it
comes with a big scoop of American tuna salad, made with plenty of
mayo. Perhaps the chef is attempting a Japanese take on vitello
tonnato.</TE>
<TE>   Another appetizer is saikyoyaki, miso-marinated sea bass broiled
in the oven. This is one of the best fish ideas anywhere, buttery and
sweet with notes of caramel and smoke in every bite.</TE>
<TE>   If you feel adventurous, call a day in advance and order one of
those yorokobi-an dinners (basically, Japanese tea ceremony food plus
tempura dishes), which range in price from $40 to $70. As in any
Japanese restaurant that serves tea ceremony food, it's impossible to
predict what ingredients will appear in the meal, only that you can
expect everything to be extremely fresh.</TE>
<TE>   And that tempura, in all its deep fried glory, will be the
featured player in your dinner.</TE>
<TE>   I-naba, 20920 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance. (310) 371-6675. Lunch
11:30 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; dinner 5:30 to
9:45 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 5 to 8:45 p.m. Sundays. Closed
Mondays. Beer and wine. Parking lot. All major cards. Dinner for two,
$28 to $90.</TE>
<TE>   What to get: sea bass saikyoyaki, ten-seiro, shrimp tempura gozen,
tempura gozen.</TE>

<DH>Sometimes, the nosebleed section is just as good as the
front row. Our intrepid reporter checks out the sight lines and
sounds in town.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In L.A., big theaters and entertainment mega-venues are microcosms of
our metropolis. They have their Beverly Hills sections, conspicuously
high-priced real estate for those who can afford "the best" and don't
mind others knowing it. They have their Silver Lakes and Echo Parks,
bohemian enclaves popular with people who fancy themselves true
connoisseurs--the balletomanes and opera queens who'll bend your ear
for hours about "sweet spots" in the mezzanine at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   And they have their Tarzanas, block after block of sensible,
unpretentious seats that offer pretty good contact with the
performers at prices that won't land you in Bankruptcy Court. Of
course, having an obscenely large disposable income never hurts if
you're trying to score a pair of courtside tickets to the Lakers
playoff game or a sixth-row, center-aisle pass to "The Lion King" at
the Pantages.</LD>
<TE>   But for some discriminating Angelenos, picking the right seat for
a hot Broadway show or a must-see dance troupe isn't only a question
of cost. It's also a matter of taste, habit, snob appeal,
reverse-snob appeal, gut instinct and dozens of other subjective
factors you won't find listed on any ticket stub. While every culture
hound has his or her price and aesthetic preferences, some people of
means would simply rather hang out with the bleacher bums in the
upper balcony, while others will settle for nothing less than a box
seat fit for the Queen Mum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all personal," says David Barber, chief publicist for the
Los Angeles Philharmonic. "There are people who love [sitting near]
the wall; there are people who love the ceiling....These things are
so mysterious. Part of it is anthropology and archeology."</TE>
<TE>   I decided to play Margaret Mead and explore the seating options at
some of the city's larger theater and concert venues. What interested
me, specifically, was how to get the best value for money, the
biggest bang for the buck, at a venue large enough to offer a variety
of seating prices and locations.</TE>
<TE>   This sounds simpler than it is. Shopping for a cost-effective,
prime spot in a 3,000-seat theater or 20,000-seat basketball arena is
like shopping for a house: You have to do your homework, and you've
got to know the neighborhood. Here, then, is one man's highly
selective account of trying to maximize his cultural horizons while
minimizing his frustration level and credit card balance.</TE>
<TE>   My quest began on a chilly December night at the new Kodak Theatre
in Hollywood, for the American Ballet Theatre's production of "The
Nutcracker." The 3,300-seat theater, which anchors the west end of
the elephantine TrizecHahn retail complex at Hollywood Boulevard and
Highland Avenue, had its coming-out party Sunday as the long-term
home of the Oscar telecast. The rest of the year it will host events
ranging from Barry Manilow concerts to Broadway shows.</TE>
<TE>   My seat, G-47, in the upper balcony, was practically as far as you
can get from the stage and still be in Los Angeles County. The
familiar strains of Tchaikovsky's ballet, rising from the orchestra
pit, sounded slightly muffled, as if they were coming through a layer
of gauze. But the sight lines were clear, there was enough legroom
for anyone short of Shaquille O'Neal, and the stage, though steeply
inclined, was close enough that I could make out the Sugar Plum
Fairies' expressions as they twirled across the floor. Not bad for a
$30 ticket in a venue of such epic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Kodak opened in the fall, several critics have lamented
its deliberately muted acoustics, a concession to Oscar night's need
for pure, modulated sound. Others have issued warnings about the
seats in the raised loge area, to the rear of the orchestra and under
the first mezzanine--a sonic dead zone in many live theaters. In his
review of "The Nutcracker," Times dance critic Lewis Segal wrote that
the "rake," or incline, of the Kodak's floor in those sections "from
row to row isn't always generous enough to keep the head in front of
you from blocking your view," unless that head belongs to, say, a
kindergartner.</TE>
<TE>   Plunking myself down in various seating sections after the show, I
saw Segal's point: From the rear orchestra and loge areas, the
Kodak's wide, deep proscenium stage--a boon for flying in scenery or
spreading out actors and dancers--could pose a neck-craning challenge
to spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Later, I met with Ed Murphy, the Kodak's managing director and
previously director of event services at Staples Center. "I'm an
arena guy, so I'm very partial to the 'nosebleeds,'" he said,
invoking the vernacular term for upper-tier seating. The design of
modern arenas and performance venues tends to be very "cost-driven,"
Murphy said. That's why so many new sports arenas attach so much
importance to building skyboxes and luxury suites. It's also why
otherwise state-of-the-art theaters like the Kodak include
old-fashioned opera boxes that can be sold off for thousands of
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   This new corporate imperative in entertainment venue design can be
a mixed blessing, as I've discovered during numerous Staples Center
outings for concerts and Clippers games. Like the Kodak, Staples is
stacked high and tight, affording good views even to upper-tier
spectators. Its acoustics are no worse--and, alas, no better--than at
other new sports arenas. But with today's sophisticated sound
systems, Imax-size video screens and in-your-face scoreboard
pyrotechnics, you don't have to be sitting in the front row to get a
sense of what's happening on stage or on court. Like it or not,
you're paying for flash and spectacle, not intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   My problem with Staples Center is more a philosophical one: the
venue's obsessive concern with keeping the hoi polloi quarantined
from the limousine crowd by means of separate entrances, concessions
areas, even bathrooms. This hierarchy is enforced by humorless
security personnel constantly on the lookout for scofflaws trying to
switch to better seats, even if the home team is losing by 20 points
and the arena is barely half full. Unless you're in one of the
corporate suites or your name is Jack Nicholson, Staples can make you
feel like a steerage passenger on the Titanic who's accidentally
strayed into first class.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere seemed funkier and less Big Brother-ish at the
Forum, where my wife and I took in the Aerosmith concert in early
January. Though our $40 seats were up in "the gods," as the British
call them, and only half the overhead lights appeared to be working,
we didn't miss a moment of Joe Perry's ear-splitting blues licks or
Steve Tyler's runway preening. All we avoided by not sitting further
down was being crushed by the heavy-metal mob. For head-banging
entertainment, give me the Forum's blue-collar, industrial-strength
aura over Staples' sanitized fussiness any day.</TE>
<TE>   Few venue operators have given more thought to creating an
environment for customers of all aesthetic tastes and income levels
than Claire Rothman. A former president and general manager of the
Forum for 21 years, Rothman also has worked at the Spectrum in
Philadelphia. She was chair of the Music Center Operating Company in
Los Angeles and is now vice chair of the Music Center. She spent
several more years as a Ticketmaster executive.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, Rothman says, just like 747s, big performance venues have
different seats to accommodate different budgets. But what do most
tourists remember about their trip to Paris--the Eiffel Tower or the
airline in-flight meal?</TE>
<TE>   "If you give the person a good-quality piece of entertainment and
they can see and they can hear, even if they're far away, they get
caught up in it," Rothman says. "It's the act they come to see, not
the venue. Nobody comes to an empty house to say, 'What beautiful
covering on these seats!'"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, I thought, there are no truly bad seats, only bad shows.
Both were available at a holiday matinee of the Disney musical "Aida"
at the Ahmanson Theatre. "Did you bring any extra oxygen?" a woman
behind me asked her male companion as she took her seat in the upper
balcony. Nearby, a father jokingly warned his young son not to jump.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Ahmanson's balcony appears more compact than the
Kodak's, its perspective seems more pinched, its sound quality
erratic. Directly in front of me, Marla Gam-Hudson was voicing
displeasure with her $20 seats several rows from the front of the
balcony, where she said a salesperson told her the seats would be.
Gam-Hudson, who teaches theater at Cal State Northridge and also
directs plays at theaters around town, had organized a group of about
40 friends and students to see "Aida" that afternoon. "It's
definitely not as clear up here. I'd rather be down there," she said,
indicating the orchestra level.</TE>
<TE>   I had no such problems watching "Fiddler on the Roof" from an
equally high altitude at the Wilshire Theatre, the faded but elegant
Art Deco monument on the border of Beverly Hills. Seated in the front
row of the "back," or upper, balcony, I had a fine view of Anatevka
and could catch Theodore Bikel's droll inflections on "If I Were a
Rich Man."</TE>
<TE>   The Wilshire is in some ways a strange space, and its rear
orchestra seats are to be avoided. The sight lines are OK, but voices
there sometimes get flattened into a distant drone, as happened
during last fall's production of "Copenhagen." But the theater does
fine by an old warhorse like "Fiddler," where half the audience
probably walks in knowing the score.</TE>
<TE>   Another of L.A.'s vintage venues, the Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood looks and sounds better than ever. After an extensive
buffing-up, the Pantages has been packing in the masses for Disney's
blockbuster musical "The Lion King" since September 2000, and the
show is booked through the year. The $12 mezzanine seats for "The
Lion King" are among the best large-theater bargains in town, which
explains why they're snapped up practically the moment they go on
sale. Other "Lion King" ticket prices range from $32 to a whopping
$127.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful that spending those extra bucks will get you a
better panorama of this sprawling production, with its mesmerizing
puppets and frenetic dance numbers. "The Lion King" offers another
good value: The "horseshoe" of $32 seats at the rear of the
orchestra, some of which are just a row or two behind the $47
section.</TE>
<TE>   The night I attended, Aval Johnson and her daughter Alean Bridges
were savoring the view from their $12 mezzanine seats. They'd
economized even more by bringing their own refreshments. "[My] sister
came last month, and she told us to bring some snacks," Bridges said.
"So we've got ginger snaps, wheat crackers and bottled water." A
longtime patron of the Ahmanson and the Shubert, Johnson, who is 4
feet 8, told me she always sits in the mezzanine, "otherwise I'm
always looking at someone's head." Pondering her advice, I flashed
back 20 years to an expensive box seat at the Shubert Theatre in New
York, so far to the side that I missed half the chorus in "A Chorus
Line."</TE>
<TE>   It was time to take the L.A. audiophile's acid test: the Los
Angeles Philharmonic at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Yes, you can
compromise on sound and visual quality when it's only Aerosmith in a
basketball arena. But what subtleties of seat selection might I learn
from classical music lovers, those people with ears as finely
balanced as a Stradivarius?</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Phil's Feb. 21 program looked promisingly strenuous:
Bach, Tchaikovsky's "Pathetique" and the Los Angeles premiere of
"Offertorium," a raucously defiant orchestral work by contemporary
Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina. Conventional wisdom holds that
the front eight or 10 rows of the balcony are the best place to hear
classical music because sound rises. Other connoisseurs swear by the
first few rows behind the conductor or opposite a favorite section,
such as the brass.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Edelist, a 72-year-old Encino resident raised in Cologne,
Germany, is among the higher-is-better believers. A piano player, he
favors the balcony not only for its superior sound, he says, but also
so that he can watch the pianist's hands at work. "The auditory
aspect is important," he says, "but the visual aspect is very
important too."</TE>
<TE>   Another longtime L.A. Phil subscriber, Richard Engdahl, is a
habitue of the first eight rows of the balcony, center section. "And
I'd say the least cost-effective would be the orchestra ring, the
back of the orchestra, because I think you're paying more for those
seats than many other places in the hall, and the sound is not that
good."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many of the Chandler's symphonic pluses and minuses may
be passe by the fall of 2003, when the L.A. Phil moves across the
street to the new 2,273-seat Walt Disney Concert Hall, leaving Los
Angeles Opera as the Chandler's principal tenant. In the new Frank
Gehry-designed hall, patrons will surround the orchestra on all
sides, doing away with antiquated proscenium arches and boxes.
Theoretically, there shouldn't be a bad seat in the house.</TE>
<TE>   So does that mean only millionaires and chuckleheads will be
shelling out for front-row perches? Ah, so many performances, so many
decisions ... so little time. Culture-saturated and beer in hand, it
was time to repair to my back porch to contemplate the sublime white
noise of the distant Hollywood Freeway.</TE>

<LD>Trying to generalize about seating in places as different as the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson and the new Kodak Theatre can
seem like a fool's errand. But here are a few all-purpose guidelines
for scoping out L.A.'s larger entertainment venues:</LD>
<LD>   * In houses of 1,000 seats and more, be wary of rear orchestra
seating and areas under the mezzanines and balconies, where sound can
be muffled and distant.</LD>
<LD>   * Don't order tickets without consulting a seating chart. Many
venues now post floor plans on their Web sites. And don't accept
telephone salespersons' claims that they can't describe where your
seats are located; at large venues, such information should be
readily available.</LD>
<TE>   * If you're leaning toward a less expensive seat, ask the
salesperson to put you in the part of the inexpensive section that's
closest to the pricier seats.</TE>
<TE>   * If you're in the nosebleed areas at an opera or a play, spend
the extra $5 to $10 for binoculars. They're not the perfect solution,
but they can make the difference between a good experience and a
forgettable one.</TE>
<TE>   * For long-running shows, if you can't find a decent seat at a
price you like, don't be stampeded by promoters' warnings to "hurry
up and buy now." If a show is very popular and able to extend its
run, more good seats at reasonable prices eventually will be put on
sale.</TE>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody keeps asking me what the name of the new Italian restaurant
is on Little Santa Monica Boulevard not far from the Museum of
Television &amp; Radio. Pamily? Pommolly? Polima? Nobody can remember
which way it goes. One person in the know kindly thought it would
help to relate that Pammolli is what you get if you combine the names
of the owner's two daughters--Pam and Molly. Wrong. Chef-owner
Massimo Ormani may or may not have two such daughters. Pammolli, in
fact, is his mother's maiden name.</LD>
<LD>   After cooking at Locanda Veneta for the past 11 years, Ormani has
moved north a few blocks and opened his own restaurant. Mandarette
tried out this space for a while but couldn't make a go of it. Before
that, it was a somewhat shabby Hungarian restaurant where I used to
see women eating at sidewalk tables with their poodles in tow. Now
it's a vision of romantic Italy with Venetian red walls, beeswax
candles and faux frescoes. According to our waiter, everything on the
menu is "awesome." I'm thinking maybe he should learn a little
Italian, at least enough to pronounce the food fantastico or
meraviglioso, if he feels compelled to give an opinion.</LD>
<TE>   First courses are promising, particularly since many of them are
dishes you don't see at every Italian restaurant in town. There's a
very pretty endive salad made with red and white varieties, fanned
slices of ripe avocado and rosy, barely cooked shrimp. Warm seafood
casserole perfumed with lemon makes another good starter. Although
penne with Bolognese sauce is a bit dry, the sauce has a lovely
subtle taste. Ribollito comes in a lidded porcelain bowl, which seems
a strange choice for the Tuscan peasant soup thickened with bread.</TE>
<TE>   Main courses seem as if they come from another kitchen entirely.
Braised veal shank arrives with the bone sticking straight up, quite
the macho presentation, which doesn't disguise its ordinariness.
Lobster in the pricey pasta dish is so tough it turns eating it into
a wrestling match. The lobster wins. Pheasant breast isn't exactly
tender either. The best main course we tried was the special of the
night, tagliolini with asparagus and porcini mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Someone in the kitchen has a thing with the vertical. A narrow
wedge of hazelnut torte with a seam of chocolate teeters on the
plate. Too bad its warm, nutty character is held in check by its icy
cold temperature--straight from the frigo. The ricotta cheesecake
comes lying down, the better for attempting to cut through its hard,
resistant crust. It's too much work. Nobody finishes it.</TE>
<TE>   I'm hoping these are just temporary glitches. L.A. never flags in
its enthusiasm for Italian restaurants. If Pammolli can find its
center and deliver authentic Italian fare in this charming
neighborhood setting, it just may succeed where modern Chinese
didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Pammolli, 9513 Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310) 273-7588.
Appetizers $8 to $14; pasta and risotto dishes, $14 to $28; main
courses $15 to $28. Open for lunch and dinner Monday through
Saturday. Valet parking.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here in Southern California, year-round gardening can take root in
any backyard, apartment balcony or local community garden plot. From
coffee cans to elaborate raised beds, gardens come in all shapes and
sizes.</LD>
<LD>   For kids, gardens can be a learning experience, a science
experiment, an art project, a family activity or a way to contribute
to the dinner table.</LD>
<LD>   And while it may be tough for some kids to exchange video games
and the Internet for a shovel and a sack of fertilizer, parents can
cultivate in their children a lifelong love of the plant kingdom.</LD>
<TE>   "The key thing is to give children--of any age--a sense of
ownership. This is their garden, they have to take care of it," says
Amy Gifford, gardening associate at the National Gardening Assn.
"Parents can nurture that sense of pride, design [the garden] with
them, play with them in it, make it fun and exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Garden designer Tony Kienitz agrees that a successful gardener
comes from a successful garden. The Pasadena-based Kienitz has
designed many children's gardens for clients. He advises matching a
child's developmental needs and interests  to the garden, separating
their interest into three age groups.</TE>
<TE>   "From toddlers to 5-years-olds, it's all about seeds. They love to
see the seeds go in the ground, and of course there's the 'digging in
the dirt' factor," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Five- to 10-year-olds, on the other hand, are fascinated with
food and growing something to eat. That's when you create those pizza
or spaghetti gardens--planting tomatoes, basil, onions, etc."</TE>
<TE>   For older kids, Kienitz suggests getting them involved by letting
them design the garden, piecing the plant shapes, sizes and the
colors together like a game or puzzle. "At some point, let the kid
teach you," he says. "Tell them that in the garden they are the boss,
and see what happens then. You might learn something."</TE>
<TE>   To foster a quick sense of accomplishment among the youngest set,
Kienitz admits to a few sly tricks. After planting seeds with them,
he has secretly returned a few days later with small starter plants
and waited for the squeals of delight. But isn't that cheating?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make kids feel like they have succeeded, that is the
No. 1 rule," argues Kienitz. "You hear adults say they have black
thumbs, and I am sure it's because they tried once or twice and
failed. You have got to make kids think they can do this."</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Goldstein of Northridge admits that she doesn't know that
much about gardening, but that doesn't stop her and her 6-year-old
son, Dylan, from experimenting in their backyard garden. "It's very
satisfying to Dylan to see how things grow, learning that big, circle
of life stuff. What he doesn't like is the maintenance, the weeding,"
she says with a sigh and a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The Goldsteins have been attending monthly gardening classes
sponsored by the Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia. (The
Fullerton Arboretum also offers gardening classes for children.)
Dylan and other kids in the Garden Sprouts program play nature games,
do garden crafts and then spend some time in the Arboretum's Roots
and Shoots garden tending their plants.</TE>
<TE>   Keep Kids Involved</TE>
<TE>   by Working With Them</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Beach, education specialist at the L.A. Arboretum, says that
to keep kids in the garden, parents need to set a good example--get
in the garden with them to plant, weed and rejoice when a seedling
takes hold. "Nature projects are also good ways to keep their
interest," she adds, such as creating homemade stepping stones,
birdfeeders, birdbaths and scarecrows.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to tackle a garden alone, get inspired at a
nearby community garden that showcases a wide variety of gardening
styles and gardeners. With more than 60 locations around Los Angeles
County, community gardens offer more than just a physical space, but
an engaging environment for kids to learn, says Yvonne Savio, manager
of the Common Ground Garden Program, a division of the University of
California Cooperative Extension.</TE>
<TE>   "Many community gardens are intergenerational, intercultural, with
all types of people coming together to do the same thing," explains
Savio. "Kids get to work with their neighbors and share with others.
They learn that the world is contained in every garden and in every
gardener."</TE>

<LD>For first-time gardeners, experts suggest trying brightly colored
flowers or vegetables in unusual colors such as purple potatoes or
yellow pear tomatoes. Big seeds--such as corn, beans and
sunflowers--are easier for little hands to hold and examine. Bulbs
are great container plants that require little maintenance once in
the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some other easy-to-grow suggestions:</LD>
<LD>   Flowers: marigolds, zinnias, sages (red, purple, etc.), cosmos,
snapdragons, daisies, sweet peas, nasturtiums, scarlet runner beans.</LD>
<TE>   Vegetables: peas, radishes, purple bean bushes, alfalfa sprouts,
rainbow chards, beets (white, orange, red, pink), giant or miniature
pumpkins (especially white), squashes, Malabar spinach, orange cherry
tomatoes.</TE>

<LD>* The actress who plays Lauren Davis on Fox's "Boston Public" also
appeared in "The Horse Whisperer."</LD>
<LD>   Homework Panic: I started taking a writing course in the UCLA
extension, "Flash Fiction." I like the fear the night before class
that I haven't written my short story, but you have to have something
to hand in. It's also amazing to hear what the other students have
written. There can just be this guy in the corner of the classroom
who hasn't spoken the entire course, and then he reads his short
story and you're like, "Whoa! What's going on in that guy's head?"</LD>
<LD>   Dinner In: Just about every weekend, I get together with some
friends of mine, and it's my house this weekend, and everyone will
come over and bring a bottle of wine. I will make a pasta dish or
maybe a barbecue, now that I have a front porch. And we just eat,
catch up on our weeks and play parlor games like charades and
celebrity.</LD>
<TE>   Off Leash: I go to a canyon just about every morning, usually with
two friends and their two dogs, and we let the three dogs run off and
get in trouble. There aren't many places where you can take your dog
off-leash and I don't like to go to Runyon Canyon, because my dog
does have an appetite for little dogs, so we try to take them to more
secluded canyons. When we do run into a ranger, what we do is we
feign an injury, so someone will fall and pretend they have some sort
of knee collapse. Then we all get very concerned. It's worked for us
twice.</TE>
<TE>   Extra Cheese, Please: I like really bad Mexican food, like lots of
cheese. So we'll go somewhere like El Coyote and get margaritas. I
like the cheese enchiladas, which is basically cheese, covered with
cheese with maybe a little more cheese.</TE>
<TE>   I Hate Mondays: Ever since I was a kid, Sunday meant Monday was
coming and the weekend was over. So my friend Courtney and I go down
to the beach and play volleyball in a big group. I don't like to be
home on Sunday nights either, so I'll meet a friend for sushi or go
to the gym and go spinning. I usually have to be at work on Monday by
5:30 in the morning, so I try to be in bed by 11 and then I just lie
there thinking, "Monday is coming, Monday is coming."</TE>

<LD>The journey from innocence to experience is a grueling progression.</LD>
<LD>   For a young person of ambivalent sexuality, the trip can be
particularly perilous.</LD>
<LD>   Set in 1962, Larry Maraviglia's "Little Secrets" at the Space
Theatre explores the vulnerability and potential cruelty of
adolescents and young adults.</LD>
<TE>   Don (Will Heermance) is a sheltered scholarship student just
arriving at Northern Florida University in Orlando for his freshman
term. As ill luck would have it, Don's new roommate is Jarrett
Sinclair (Al Sol), a manic, mannered upperclassman with a host of
affectations and a sadistic streak.</TE>
<TE>   The intellectually supercilious Jarrett presents himself as a
wealthy and dissolute young man about town. The truth is far more sad
and prosaic, but when Jarrett bullies Don into admitting an early
homosexual affair, Jarrett uses Don's fear of exposure to make Don
his unwilling slave.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds kinky, it is. It's no coincidence that film buff
Jarrett adores "Strangers on a Train." The plot of Maraviglia's taut
psychological drama echoes that of the film. Jarrett, the malevolent
stranger, himself of dubious sexuality, blackmails Don and seizes
control of his life.</TE>
<TE>   But Maraviglia is playing for larger stakes than mere suspense.</TE>
<TE>   There's a deeper, malevolent layer to Jarrett's sick game, the
sense that, particularly for young men of Jarrett and Don's
pre-Stonewall generation, homosexuality carried with it heavy
freight: suicide, scandal, shame and madness.</TE>
<TE>   The performers, including Mike Winiarski as Don's jock pal Tim,
are engaging, if a bit overblown.</TE>
<TE>   The less than stellar staging, by Sol and Lance W. Lane, tends
toward the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   A little underplaying would do wonders here, not to mention
trimming a few blatant anachronisms.</TE>
<TE>   References to mushroom burgers, cappuccino and panic attacks seem
out of place in this otherwise deft period piece.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Secrets," Space Theatre, 665 N. Heliotrope, Hollywood.
Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends April 7. $12. (323) 414-5440. Running

<DH>Singer-songwriter John Mayer takes the low-key route to
success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My life in the last two years has been a series of trading fantasies
for the reality," says singer-songwriter John Mayer.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting on a sofa in his publicist's office at Columbia Records'
headquarters in Santa Monica, the lanky Atlanta resident doesn't have
to go to great lengths to give examples. His major-label debut album,
"Room for Squares," is steadily growing in sales, reaching nearly
250,000 with very little radio play since its release last year.</LD>
<LD>   His touring success has grown even more quickly, with sellouts of
theaters in the 1,500-capacity range routine in the Southeast, where
he established himself as a solo performer on the college-town
circuit in the last few years. Even in L.A., he's grown from two
small club dates in October to sold-out nights at the West Hollywood
House of Blues on Wednesday and next Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Among his fans is no less than Elton John, who was his host at
dinner recently and heaped praise and admiration on the young
musician in a lengthy conversation between the two that was published
recently in Interview magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and Mayer, 24, has just learned that he and his band have been
invited to a Hollywood party with an adult entertainment company as
host.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the reality is more fantasy than the fantasy was," he
says with a sly grin. "Which is great."</TE>
<TE>   Confident without being cocky, Mayer comes off as someone who
believes he's destined for big things but still has a boyish,
gee-whiz joy and appreciation for the trappings. The gesture from
John, he says, was beyond anything he could have hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's someone who has the master bedroom of the pop music
house," Mayer says. "When he sticks his neck out and says, 'Welcome,'
that's big."</TE>
<TE>   But if life in the music world is revealing itself as more than
he'd expected, the Connecticut-raised Mayer is doing the same about
his own talents. The album, released first on Chicago's Aware Records
and then through a deal the company has with Columbia Records (the
same path taken by Train and Five for Fighting), presents Mayer as a
fairly straightforward singer-songwriter. His low-key style, subtly
sophisticated musical structures and lyrics both observational and
romantic--his "Your Body Is a Wonderland" seems destined to accompany
countless awkward dorm seductions--pegged him as a youthful version
of Dave Matthews or David Gray.</TE>
<TE>   Those who saw him live in the solo performances that won him the
record deal in the first place knew him as an engaging, confident
presence with an almost Sting-like appeal. The biggest surprise to
fans, though, came about six months ago when he first started playing
live with a full band.</TE>
<TE>   Strapping on an electric guitar and stepping to the front of the
stage mid-show, he'd unleash flurries of notes drawn straight from
the Stevie Ray Vaughan school of guitar heroics.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother says, 'John, why don't you jam out more?'" says Mayer,
surmising that he's reluctant to show off too much after being
surrounded by flash-over-substance noodlers in a year he spent at
Boston's Berklee School of Music. "I can. And the next record will
have more guitar playing. But I like that I haven't shown people my
variables."</TE>
<TE>   But he also knows that he's benefited thus far from largely flying
under the pop culture radar.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad at the time when I signed it came down to just making
music. I took the low-expectations route. I'm glad I didn't have a
deal with so much money that every move is scrutinized. With Aware, I
had just enough money to pay off my debt. I was in the studio working
on the album the second day after signing the deal."</TE>
<TE>   It probably won't be that way with his next album. Expectations
have risen dramatically, and from now on he won't be flying under the
radar.</TE>
<TE>   But he hopes to be able to go about his next career move the same
way he has up to this point.</TE>
<TE>   "So many things in my life appear to be noble, but in reality
they're circumstantial," he says. "What I do know is I made a record
that wasn't watched by a lot of people, and it seems to have turned
out fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hold it up and say, 'Look what happens when I make records
this way.'" Mayer also holds up examples of other artists he feels
have succeeded doing things their way. Among his current obsessions,
he cites late English folk singer Nick Drake and current artists
Rufus Wainwright and D'Angelo, as well as new jazz-pop sensation
Norah Jones, whom he picked as the opening act for his upcoming
shows.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it comes down to vision, really," he says. "Bands like
U2, artists like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have unflagging
vision--not the Madonna I-want-to-rule-the-world kind of thing, but
vision of the next song. If you're not constantly holding up that
template of what you want to do, you won't move forward."</TE>

<LD>   "Bradbury X 2"--At 81, Ray Bradbury's reverence for the limitless
imagination of childhood hasn't dimmed, and that signature theme
unites the one-acts paired in "Bradbury X 2" at Theatre West. Adapted
by Bradbury from two of his short stories from the 1960s, the pieces
showcase different facets of the author's complex personality. And
while they don't entirely shed their literary DNA in this translation
to the floorboards, handsome staging by Charles Rome Smith
successfully illuminates the ageless appeal of Bradbury's expansive
spirit.</LD>
<LD>   "To the Chicago Abyss," the shorter, opening piece, is also the
more theatrically accomplished--an eerie sojourn with Bradbury in his
futurist nightmare mood....The second piece, "Any Friend of Nicholas
Nickleby's Is a Friend of Mine," pays affectionate homage to the
retro Americana of Bradbury's youth, reminiscent in tone of
Bradbury's "Dandelion Wine."</LD>

at the Rubicon Theatre Company at the Laurel, 1006 E. Main St.,
Ventura, (805) 667-2900.</TE>
<TE>   "Destronelli"--Dennis Miles' intriguing but sometimes overwrought
drama, about a gay man's relationship with an elderly woman and a
flirtation with a stalker, has a fine cast and keen direction. It
ends Saturday at Theatre of NOTE, 1517 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood,
(323) 856-8611.</TE>
<TE>   "A Hatful of Rain"--Vivid performances bring alive Michael Gazzo's
cautionary tale about addiction, infidelity and the hungry machines
of war and commerce. It ends Sunday at the Actors Forum Theatre,
10655 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, (818) 506-0600.</TE>

<LD>   Winky Dink and You! Volume 1. Vanguard Kids. $15. 45 minutes. Ages
3 and up. (888) 205-8778.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of a kind: "Winky Dink and You!," which began airing in
1953 and had a long life in syndication, was the first interactive TV
show.</LD>
<TE>   Corny and simplistic as all get-out, it was a huge hit. Kids
eagerly mailed in 50 cents for a square of clear, clingy plastic (the
"magic screen"), crayons and an erasing cloth.</TE>
<TE>   Children tuned in the show, smoothed the piece of plastic on the
screen and waited for their cue to draw as directed in order to help
Winky Dink and his dog pal foil the very mildly nefarious schemes of
portly villain Harem Scarem.</TE>
<TE>   In this first video release of the show--the video kit includes
screen, crayons and cloth--viewers complete a staircase and draw a
ship, musical instruments and other simple shapes.</TE>
<TE>   The lines to trace are shown on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Laughably low-tech as it is, kids can still get a kick out of
seeing Winky gliding along in the crayon ship they drew, or Harem
Scarem pounding on a crayon drum.</TE>
<TE>   The downside: When kids draw on the plastic, they're nose to nose
with the screen.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's that brain-sticking little theme song: "Winky
Dink and you, Winky Dink and me.... "</TE>
<TE>   Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring. Warner Home Video. 62 minutes. VHS:
$15; DVD: $20.</TE>
<TE>   This unfunny hour starring eternal foes Tom the cat and Jerry the
mouse in a new adventure involving endless head bashings, body slams
and chases won't afford even nostalgic fans much pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   The plot: Tom must safeguard a wizard's ring and Jerry gets it
stuck on his head and runs away to the city, attracting the attention
of other cats, other cartoon characters and humans.</TE>
<TE>   This affords many opportunities for punches, bites, the
application of blunt instruments, heavy object-dropping and wreckage
in general.</TE>
<TE>   Almost wordless, the cartoon characters express themselves ad
nauseam with shrill gasps and screams, eyeballs popping out of
sockets and tongues out of mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Only composer J. Eric Schmidt's music--classical and jazz themes
and punctuation--come out a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   Beethoven's Wig: Sing Along Symphonies. Rounder Records. CD: $13.
Ages 7 to 12. (800) ROUNDER;  www.rounder.com</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a short Beethoven piano piece/He wrote this piece just for
Elise/It's all about a fellow named Maurice/Who came from Greece with
a valise.... "</TE>
<TE>   Oh, my. Purists beware: Classical cutup Richard Perlmutter has
taken an irreverent, witty approach to music appreciation, adding
lyrics to certain works by famous composers to come up with a
laugh-out-loud album that pretty much guarantees listeners will
forevermore recognize them.</TE>
<TE>   Beethoven's "Fur Elise" is a tale of theft and retribution, as
Maurice purloins the piece from Elise, and the Fifth Symphony
occasions a wide-eyed rumination on the composer's "gigantic and
titanic" wig. Haydn's "Surprise" Symphony hilariously points out the
surprise ("Did that outburst startle you?/Well, that's what it was
meant to do").</TE>
<TE>   Perlmutter, who also sings the lead vocals, isn't being silly for
silliness' sake.</TE>
<TE>   In this lively, carefully constructed introduction to classical
music, the pieces are beautifully performed by legitimate orchestras
and ensembles, with each selection repeated as instrumental tracks;
the CD book includes serious trivia questions and a thoughtful list
of related activities.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph's World: At the Bottom of the Sea. Mini Fresh. Ages 3 to 8.
CD: $13. www.minifresh.com</TE>
<TE>   An effortless mix of various musical styles, standout instrumental
performances and Ralph Covert's versatile vocals, this stellar mix of
imagination and humor is Covert's terrific, family-friendly follow-up
to his highly praised debut album, "Ralph's World."</TE>
<TE>   From the bluesy "Clean My Room" and the title tune ("where the
dog-fish woof, glub; and the catfish meow, blub") to a dead-on,
"Beach Boys"-style "Surfin' in My Imagination" and the vivid and
unexpectedly touching "Harry's Halloween Circus," ("Have you seen the
ghosts of circus past reach out from haunted circus tents? So
tragic"), Covert offers listeners--parents too--a treat for the ears.</TE>

<HD>A Dogged Pursuit of Symbolism</HD>
<DH>'And Still the Dogs' makes sweeping political statements
without subtlety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A person can be hit over the head with only so much symbolism before
wanting to hit back.</LD>
<LD>   That exasperation level doesn't take long to reach while sitting
through "And Still the Dogs."</LD>
<LD>   Every character is an archetype, every line a political statement
in first-time playwright Brian Cousins' cautionary tale about an
American businessman tangled in a dangerous liaison with an Eastern
European beauty.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a sort of Eastern European "M. Butterfly," but
without any of that play's subtlety and without an identity shift
anywhere near so clever.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Los Angeles branch of New York's Ensemble Studio
Theatre approaches the material with such courage and commitment that
it becomes a chilling descent into darkness.</TE>
<TE>   The action unfolds in an unspecified country still shell-shocked
from the revolution that overthrew Communism.</TE>
<TE>   Decrepitude hangs over Jason Adams' set.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every surface is covered by plywood, corrugated metal or
plastic sheeting--the sorts of unsightly barriers erected while
renovations are being made to old buildings.</TE>
<TE>   In a burst of overoptimistic capitalism, advertising posters have
multiplied like weeds across these temporary surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Two American businessmen--one known only as the Man (Garrett M.
Brown), the other named Roger (Colin Mitchell)--visit the country in
hopes of sealing a deal to distribute their products through
intermediaries.</TE>
<TE>   The Man--who is married, with children--encounters Emilia
(Jacqueline Wright), a native of the country, at a disco and
recklessly launches into an affair.</TE>
<TE>   Things get off to a passionate start, but the big, boisterous,
self-satisfied Man begins to wear on Emilia's nerves.</TE>
<TE>   And then her past comes back to threaten them both.</TE>
<TE>   (Separate casts perform Thursdays-Fridays and Saturdays-Sundays,
except for Brown, who handles the central role every day but Sundays,
when Cousins takes over. The actors reviewed are from the
Thursday-Friday cast.)</TE>
<TE>   Dan Bonnell's direction doesn't always zip the action along, but
Brown helps to keep the show on track with his portrait of American
arrogance and obliviousness.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell is a nice contrast as his conscience-stricken partner,
but Wright gets hung up in the odd, strangled poetry that Cousins
concocts as Emilia's lines.</TE>
<TE>   The solid acting carries the play for a while, but the killing
that begins and ends the show is just plain stomach-turning.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, "And Still the Dogs" does itself in with heavy-handed
symbolism and numbingly self-evident observations.</TE>
<TE>   "And Still the Dogs," Ensemble Studio Theatre--The L.A. Project at
the Lillian Theater, 1076 N. Lillian Way, Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends April 14. $22-$25.
(213) 368-9552. Running time: 2 hours.</TE>

<LD>Something about this comfort food makes everyone nostalgic.</LD>
<LD>   Mastro's: Creamed corn is on the long list of a la carte
vegetables at this new Beverly Hills steakhouse. It's fresh corn,
briefly blanched and thrown into bechamel sauce. Then it's lightly
seasoned with salt and pepper and garnished with parsley. The dish is
large enough for two to three people to split. (Creamed corn, $8.95.)
Mastro's, 246 N. Canon Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 888-8782.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe El Cholo: This hopping Orange County spot uses creamed corn
as the sauce on a vegetarian enchilada filled with spinach, tomatoes,
peppers, mushrooms and Jack cheese. It comes with a side of sumptuous
black beans. (Vegetarian enchilada, $8.75.) Cafe El Cholo, 840 E.
Whittier Blvd., La Habra, (562) 691-4618.</LD>
<TE>   Tam O'Shanter Inn: This Los Angeles landmark is 80 years old this
month. Its creamed corn is a classic: in roux with a little sugar and
white pepper. Simple, but something about it makes you come back for
more. (Creamed corn, $2.95.) Tam O'Shanter Inn, 2980 Los Feliz Blvd.,
Los Angeles, (323) 664-0228.</TE>
<TE>   Lawry's: One of the most popular dishes at this venerable prime
rib place is corn so sweet and creamy you'll have to get more than
one serving. The corn is combined with whipping cream, butter, sugar
and salt, but what makes it exceptional is that it's sprinkled with
Parmesan and browned under the broiler before serving. (Creamed corn,
$3.95.) Lawry's, 100 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, (310)
652-2827.</TE>
<TE>   Sonora Cafe: At this elegant Tex-Mex establishment, your table
gets a complimentary plate of creamed corn with the entrees. The corn
is cooked briefly in a sauce of cream and milk seasoned with salt,
pepper, sugar and a dash of hot sauce. Its subtle sweetness is a fine
accompaniment to spicy entrees. (Creamed corn, complimentary with
entree.) Sonora Cafe, 180 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, (323)
857-1800.</TE>
<TE>   Reign: Chef Michael Rosen not only uses a little half and half to
give his creamed corn its rich flavor, he also adds the milk of the
corn straight off the cob. The sugary sweetness comes from using the
freshest corn possible along with a little butter, a touch of flour
and just enough salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. It's perfect
to split. (Creamed corn, $5.95,) Reign, 180 N. Robertson Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, (310) 273-4463.</TE>

<LD>   'Very Satisfied' With Kodak, President Says</LD>
<LD>   Frank Pierson, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, gives a mixed-to-positive review to the Kodak Theatre--the
Oscars' new home.</LD>
<TE>   The place "just doesn't sound right," he told The Times, citing
areas in which dialogue is muffled (some audience members couldn't
hear Tom Cruise's opening remarks) and speakers that need to be
moved.</TE>
<TE>   Still, media reports that the academy may pull up stakes and head
elsewhere next year are off-base, Pierson says.</TE>
<TE>   "Acoustical problems also occurred when the Hollywood Bowl was
created, and will be solved, I'm sure," he says.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to ambience, Pierson notes, the venue deserves high
marks. "There's an intimacy, a closeness with what's going on
onstage. Performers up there feel they're at a party with the
audience. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the house."</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   De Niro-Queen Musical Headed for London</TE>
<TE>   Two of the surviving members of the rock group Queen are
collaborating with Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions on a
futuristic musical featuring some of their hits, including "Crazy
Little Thing Called Love" and "Bohemian Rhapsody."</TE>
<TE>   "We Will Rock You," produced by Brian May and Roger Taylor--the
former guitarist and drummer for the band--is due to open on May 14
at London's Dominion Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The musical will be a sci-fi fantasy about a world overtaken by
globalization where everyone listens to the same computerized music
and instruments are banned, MTV News reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Queen's music is uniquely theatrical," said the project's author,
Ben Elton.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this vision where 'The Matrix' meets the Arthurian legend
meets 'Terminator 2.'" If all goes well, the producers plan to stage
the $10.7-million musical in North America, Australia, Scandinavia,
Italy and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   'FolkScene' Music Show to Return to KPFK-FM</TE>
<TE>   "FolkScene," the long-running folk and roots-music radio show that
left the local airwaves in 2000 after more than 30 years, will return
to its former home at Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM (90.7) on April
7.</TE>
<TE>   Producers Roz and Howard Larman were taken off the air after a
dispute with management over commercial use of material recorded in
or with KPFK facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Control of the station recently changed hands; the new management
resolved outstanding differences.</TE>
<TE>   The Larmans' first program will feature an interview with
singer-songwriter-actor Loudon Wainwright III, who also will give a
live performance.</TE>
<TE>   The Larmans had continued doing "FolkScene" as an Internet show,
available at www.kpig.com.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline's" five-part series on gay life in America, postponed
after the Sept. 11 attacks, will run Monday through Friday next
week....CBS has given a go-ahead to a fifth season of "Survivor,"
which will premiere in the fall. Producer Mark Burnett is scouting
locations in Central America, South America and Asia....</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, 12 semifinalists were selected in Pasadena's first
Rachmaninoff Piano Competition--only one of them from the U.S. The
contestants will play one-hour recitals tonight, Friday and Saturday
at the Norton Simon Museum, with a prize of $30,000 awaiting the
winner.</TE>

<LD>* New This Week: Director Irwin Winkler, writer Mark Andrus and a
starry cast bring winning conviction to "Life as a House," their
heart-tugging story of a sour middle-aged man (Kevin Kline) who has
one last chance to fulfill a dream and to win the love of his
troubled teenage son (Hayden Christensen). This kind of
emotion-charged material can easily seem hokey and contrived, and it
takes the combination of Andrus' easy sense of humor and deft gift of
characterization as well as Winkler's belief in the values that his
film espouses and his ability to inspire convincing portrayals all
around to make "Life as a House" work as a heartwarming, involving
experience. Kristin Scott Thomas is Kline's warm, lovely ex-wife, and
Mary Steenburgen is Kline's neighbor and ex-flame, a single mother
with an uninhibited teenage daughter (Jena Malone). Completing the
world is Dennis Washington's crucially expressive production design
and Mark Isham's always enhancing, never intrusive score.</LD>

<HD>Instruments of Change</HD>
<DH>Music* Craftswoman Carleen Hutchins revives a Renaissance
ideal by creating sets of strings with matching sounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We call violins, violas, cellos and basses a "family" of strings, but
they're more like fraternal than identical twins. Each has a distinct
timbre that comes through whenever they play as a group.</LD>
<LD>   Creating a family that sounds like one instrument across the whole
range, from soprano to bass, was a goal of instrument builders during
the Renaissance when the harmonious sounds of vocal music were the
ideal. Luthiers (the term for makers of stringed instruments) built
"chests of viols"--sets of stringed instruments matched in design and
sound to achieve blend and balance.</LD>
<LD>   But with the rise of virtuoso playing during the Baroque and
Classical periods, there was a move away from homogeneity and toward
individuality; each instrument in a set of strings began to have its
own characteristic tone "colors." Enter Carleen Hutchins who has
returned to ideals of the Renaissance by working out the complicated
engineering and physics needed to design and build sets of violins
that blend and balance.</LD>
<TE>   An ensemble dedicated to her work, the Hutchins Consort, a
Southern California-based octet founded in 1999 by contrabass
violinist Joe McNalley, will play tonight at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   It took Hutchins more than 40 years to come up with her acoustic
formula. "I was just having fun on an experiment," said Hutchins, 90,
from her home in Montclair, N.J. "[Composer] Henry Brant called me.
He was looking for a violin maker crazy enough to work on the idea,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   An amateur string player, she had degrees in education and
biology, but learned acoustics from F. A. Saunders, a Harvard
University physics professor with whom she began working in 1947. She
learned carpentry from friends, and her work as a luthier started as
a hobby.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchins took instruments apart, made changes and then reglued the
pieces. She and Saunders founded a society that enlisted help from
instrument builders, musicians and acousticians.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried everything. We tried making instruments deep and
shallow. We were making instruments that we could play."</TE>
<TE>   Was it frustrating? "You believe it," said Hutchins.</TE>
<TE>   A Guarnerius owned by Jascha Heifetz served as a prototype in
other forms of analysis. It ultimately revealed to Hutchins the key
secret of what makes a violin sound like a violin. Violins have two
resonant spots, she said. "We found them in very different places in
a viola and a cello."</TE>
<TE>   Calibrating the</TE>
<TE>   Acoustic Formula</TE>
<TE>   After figuring out mathematical ratios for the resonances, she
began to project them onto violins of different sizes. Her instrument
building took off like a shot. "We have seven full sets going now,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   A set of Hutchins violins has a range of seven and a half octaves,
from an octave below a standard string bass to an octave and a half
higher than a standard violin. The Hutchins mezzo violin has the same
tuning as a standard violin. The Hutchins alto has the same tuning as
a standard viola. The Hutchins baritone parallels a cello. The
Hutchins contrabass is closest in tuning to a string bass, but the
Hutchins bass is closest in size to that instrument.</TE>
<TE>   The other Hutchins violins (treble, soprano and small bass) allow
for a wide distribution of parts that helps the octet reproduce the
full range of orchestral music.</TE>
<TE>   McNalley, 37, heard one of the sets on loan to UC San Diego, where
he studied string bass, from 1983 to 1987. He loved the sound.</TE>
<TE>   "I started designing [a bass violin] in the late '80s. I had
gotten most of the basics down, but I couldn't figure out one of the
physics problems. After years of scratching my head, I got Carleen's
number and called her up. We started talking about my physics
problem, which was no problem for her."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchins asked McNalley if he could get a group together that
would play on one of the full octets of instruments she had built.
"Two months later, I ended up on plane to New Jersey. This was in
1999. I brought them back to California," McNalley said.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't been easy.</TE>
<TE>   First, the musicians had to learn to play the Hutchins violins.
"Fingering is obviously different from a conventional instrument,"
McNalley said. "The body lengths and the string lengths are
different."</TE>
<TE>   Hutchins likes to demonstrate the differences in sound by
juxtaposing one of her instruments with a traditional one. "That
really sets people on edge," she said. "The sound is so much better,
clearer, more powerful; there's more dynamic range. They just outplay
all the normal instruments."</TE>
<TE>   The Hutchins Consort faces the same challenges as traditional
groups--raising funds and finding an audience. It also has to build a
unique repertory--classical works aren't written for these
instruments; they must be transcribed. In some cases, the Hutchins
Consort has commissioned new works for the ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all the problems of a chamber orchestra and all the
problems of a small chamber music group," McNalley said. "We operate
on a shoestring budget. The submitted budget is about $100,000 more
than the actual money we've raised. So certain artistic directors are
not getting paid. It's an uphill battle. But it's a battle we think
we're doing very well at."</TE>
<TE>   His group will be in residence at the Leeds Center in Kentucky in
April and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in May.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are big breaks for us," he said. "We've got a lot of coals
in the fire."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hutchins is looking to the future. "We have full-scale
designs of each instrument that we're working to get computerized so
people can get a design off their computers and a set of instructions
about how to tune the plates and handle the wood.... "This is a
bootstrap operation, trying to create a demand for something where
there's been nothing. We've been working in a vacuum but gradually
we're filling it in. It's long and slow."</TE>

<HD>ABC, NPR Garner Peabody Awards for 9/11 Coverage</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting* Other honorees include 'Nightline' and HBO,
which was praised for five projects.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATHENS, Ga.</DL>
<LD>ABC News and National Public Radio won Peabody Awards on Wednesday
for their coverage of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and ABC's
embattled "Nightline" also was honored with one of the annual awards
for broadcast excellence.</LD>
<LD>   "The Bernie Mac Show," a Fox series about a man's adventures
raising his sister's three children, also won for transcending "race
and class while lifting viewers with laughter, compassion--and cool,"
the judges wrote.</LD>
<LD>   HBO was honored for five projects, including the 10-part World War
II miniseries "Band of Brothers"; "Wit," the film adaptation of
Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a woman facing
cancer; and "The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg," a documentary
about the baseball Hall of Famer that was shown on the HBO-owned
Cinemax.</LD>
<TE>   The annual awards are given by the University of Georgia's Henry
W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication to honor
broadcast excellence.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four winners were selected this year from more than 1,100
entries.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News and NPR won for their coverage of the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Cable News Network won for its
"Beneath the Veil" and "Unholy War" documentaries that looked at the
terror and violence under the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   NPR won a second Peabody for its "Jazz Profiles" program.</TE>
<TE>   Judges honored "Nightline" as "a truly remarkable television
institution demonstrating the medium's capacity to serve a vital
social function."</TE>
<TE>   ABC officials recently considered dumping the program as they
tried to lure David Letterman from CBS. Letterman signed a new
contract with CBS, but the future of "Nightline"--which attracts a
mostly older audience--is still uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Nickelodeon won two awards, for "Little Bill" and "Blue's Clues."
Judges said "Little Bill" demonstrates that "television can be quiet,
gentle and caring at every moment, with any subject, for all people."</TE>
<TE>   WGBH-TV in Boston won a Peabody as "an example of the best in
public television."</TE>

<HD>LACMA Series to Honor Films of Satyajit Ray</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LACMA is presenting "Out of India: The Films of Satyajit Ray," a
long-overdue retrospective, surely the most comprehensive presented
locally, of the work of one of the major figures in world cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Ray was a Calcutta advertising agency art director and book
illustrator whose life was transformed when he began creating
drawings for the novel "Pather Panchali" (Song of the Open Road), an
epic tale of the rural childhood and subsequent urban officer worker
existence of Apu. He was eventually able to turn this coming-of-age
story of a Bengali Everyman into a classic film trilogy, which
established his international renown when the first part was shown at
Cannes in 1956.</LD>
<LD>   Ray would range far in his depiction of life in India, and a
decade after his death, he remains by far the most famous Indian
filmmaker. His every picture is a rewarding and notable
accomplishment.</LD>
<TE>   The series begins tonight at 7:30 in Bing Theater with "The Chess
Players" (1977), in which two games are going on simultaneously. On
the one hand a pair of indolent, foolish aristocrats (Sanjeev Kumar,
Saeed Jaffrey) are so consumed with their nonstop chess matches they
don't see the larger struggle brewing all around them in Lucknow in
1856. The British East India Co., represented by Gen. Outram (Richard
Attenborough), is about to take control of Lucknow, as it has nine
other Indian states, from Lucknow's leader (Amjac Khan), an
indifferent ruler but a gifted poet and musician.</TE>
<TE>   While Kumar and Jaffrey play chess as if it were war, Khan parries
ineffectually with Attenborough, his passivity further enraging the
colonial general, making it easier for him to rationalize the drastic
step he is about to take. More interested in revealing character and
culture than in passing judgment, Ray evokes a vanished way of life
in this exquisite period film and in doing so suggests ever so deftly
that it is not Khan but the world that is out of joint.</TE>
<TE>   "Pather Panchali" (1955) screens Friday at 7:30 p.m., followed by
the intimate "Two Daughters" (1961), and Saturday brings at 7:30 p.m.
"Charulata" (The Lonely Wife, 1964) and "Kanchenjungha" (1962).</TE>
<TE>   In "Charulata" Ray takes us into the languorous world of the
Indian aristocracy in the late 19th century. Beautiful Madhabi
Mukherjee stars as the childless wife of a wealthy, well-educated
Bengali, whose determination not to be one of the idle rich has
tragic consequences. The film is a highly cinematic, evocative study
in mood and character and is concerned with women's liberation--and
by extension India's own need for self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Although the remarkable "Kanchenjungha" deals with a familiar Ray
theme, the painful emergence of modern India, it stands largely apart
from the rest of the director's work. Set in the British-founded
mountain resort of Darjeeling, which reflects the film's cosmopolitan
character, the story takes place in the town's beautiful park,
Observatory Hill.</TE>
<TE>   On the last afternoon of its stay, the large family of a powerful
Bengali financier takes a stroll that leads to a series of encounters
for its members, each of whom comes face to face with himself or
herself, especially the tyrannical patriarch who finds his implacable
authority challenged. The film takes its name from the snowy peak
that overlooks Darjeeling and can serve as a symbol of the
aspirations of India's younger generation. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' "Documentary Days" continues Saturday and
Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5 with Wieland Speck and Andrea
Weiss' illuminating "Escape to Life: The Erika and Klaus Mann Story."
The film combines brief dramatized sequences and well-researched
documentary materials to chart the tumultuous and entangled lives of
Thomas Mann's two eldest children. Both of them were apparently gay,
as well as talented and courageous in their effort not to be
intimidated by their father's stature and in their determination to
combat rising fascism. The vivacious, attractive Erika established an
anti-Nazi cabaret before being forced into exile--but not before
taking her show on tour across Europe. Klaus launched several
important literary journals, and both became tireless journalists and
lecturers, especially after coming to the U.S. in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   Though Erika flourished until her death in Switzerland in 1969,
Klaus, who had served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II,
eventually gave into despair, intensified by drug addiction, and
committed suicide in 1949. Erika, driven from the U.S. with the
advent of the McCarthy era witch hunts, thereupon devoted her efforts
to seeing her brother's work published, including his novel
"Mephisto," inspired by the life and career of Erika's first husband,
celebrated actor Gustaf Grundgens, who flourished during the Third
Reich. (W.H. Auden subsequently married Erika so that she could
establish British citizenship.)</TE>
<TE>   "Escape to Life" suggests that despite the adversities and
uncertainties of their times and their own mercurial temperaments,
Erika and Klaus managed to lead lives of substantial accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles: (323) 848-3500. The film
will screen April 6 and 7 at 11 a.m. at the Monica 4-Plex, 1332 2nd
St., Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; April 13 and 14 at the Playhouse
7, 673 Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and April 27 and 28
at the Lido, 3459 Via Lido, Newport Beach ,(949) 673-8350.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Documental," the documentary and experimental film and video
series at the Midnight Special Bookstore, 1318 Third Street
Promenade, Santa Monica, will present two programs Saturday at 7 and
9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Screening in the second program is Marjorie Chodorov's engaging
"El Rey de Rock 'n' Roll," about Robert Lopez, a Mexican American who
grew up not in a barrio but as a surfer dude in a San Diego suburb
and subsequently became the venturesome curator of the La Luz de
Jesus Gallery when it was on Melrose.</TE>
<TE>   When an Elvis impersonator he hired for a gallery opening proved
inept, Lopez thought he could do it himself. He also saw in the
possibility of a Latino Elvis a way of celebrating Mexican popular
culture and making political and social commentary--he freely revised
lyrics of the Presley standards--while putting on a dazzling, amusing
high-energy show, backed by his Elvette chorus girls and accompanied
by his Memphis Mariachis.</TE>
<TE>   A reflective, low-key man off stage, Lopez becomes a dynamo on
stage. Far from being yet another Elvis impersonator, Lopez sees
himself as a translator and his El Vez as a symbol of possibilities
for Mexican Americans. (310) 393-2923.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When visionary architect Glen Howard Small asked his daughter to
write a book about his work if he failed to do it himself before he
died, she proposed to make a documentary about him instead (see
story, Page 38). The revealing result, "My Father, the Genius," which
the American Cinematheque screens tonight at 7:30 at the Egyptian, is
at once a portrait of a visionary whose arrogance resulted in
professional and personal alienation. Small, one of the founders of
the Southern California Institute of Architecture, struggles to
survive in semi-obscurity.</TE>
<TE>   While Small, now in his early 60s, welcomes the chance to expound
upon his design theories, his daughter, one of three he virtually
deserted when they were infants, has an another agenda. She explores
his errant personal life, which is marked by an inability to have an
enduring relationship with anything but his work. Small is a crusty
individualist but not without humor, and "My Father, the Genius"
arrives at a place that surprises father and daughter alike.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Side Streets and Back Alleys," the American Cinematheque's fourth
annual "Festival of Film Noir," opens Friday, running through April
14. One of the Cinematheque's most popular offerings, featuring many
personal appearances by stars and filmmakers, begins at 7 p.m. with
"The Naked City" (1948), a classic police procedural thriller, set in
Manhattan and directed by Jules Dassin and written by Malvin Wald.
Barry Fitzgerald and Howard Duff star; Wald will appear after the
screening.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 there will be a Robert Siodmak double feature, "Phantom
Lady" (1944), starring Ella Raines as a plucky young woman searching
for a missing woman who can save her boss from execution. Based on a
Cornell Woolrich novel, It holds up better than "Christmas Holiday"
(1945), based on a Somerset Maugham story and of greatest interest
for casting two musical stars against type. Lovely, naive Deanna
Durbin falls for Gene Kelly, charming but dangerous scion of an old
New Orleans family, destroyed by the high expectations of his
ultra-possessive mother (Gale Sondergaard, way over the top). It's a
creaky '40s psychological drama at heart, but Siodmak gets good
straight dramatic performances from Durbin and Kelly. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<HD>It's the 'Experience'</HD>
<DH>Percussionist Evelyn Glennie, profoundly deaf since 11,
finds music to be tactile. She's sharing what she knows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to some musicians, hearing is actually a form of touch.
Both senses rely on vibrations--the rumbling of a floor during an
earthquake, the trembling of an eardrum as a cymbal crashes.</LD>
<LD>   That's how Grammy-winning classical percussionist Evelyn Glennie,
profoundly deaf since age 11, experiences music during concerts.
Those tactile cues, along with a percussionist's dance-like
movements, are a more complete package--a way to appreciate music
that encompasses multiple senses.</LD>
<LD>   When Glennie performs Saturday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as
part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.'s annual Toyota Symphonies
for Youth, that's exactly what she plans to give her audience of
parents and elementary school kids: a total package.</LD>
<TE>   "Music is a medicine, really," Glennie says. "I use the word
'experience' music, as opposed to hearing."</TE>
<TE>   Concert attendees aren't likely to find out much more about
Glennie's disability, at least, not from organizers at the
philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   To Glennie and Llewellyn Crain, the philharmonic's director of
educational initiatives, the musician's hearing condition is simply
not relevant, no matter how impressive her accomplishment in the face
of that disability. They'd rather have people judge her on the
quality of her performances, which, during the course of her 17-year
professional career, has earned her scores of critical accolades.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not an issue," Crain says of Glennie's hearing. "It has no
bearing to me as an audience member."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Glennie and Crain describe the show as a journey through
the world of rhythm. It's a crash course in percussion, titled, aptly
enough, "BAM!"</TE>
<TE>   Before the concert, kids and their families will be invited to
hang out in the lobby, where they can touch and try out various
instruments, watch dancers and listen to storytellers. Later, during
the orchestra performance, Glennie will play an array of percussion
instruments. The water gong, vibraphone, snare drum and a clanging
instrument called an Almglocken each will be left to the mercies of
what she calls her specific "attack."</TE>
<TE>   "You can stroke the instrument, or bite at the instrument, or fall
into it--whatever," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   Between songs, she and conductor Miguel Harth-Bedoya will take
questions from the children and parents in the audience.</TE>
<TE>   This planned spectacle of sight, sound and interaction contrasts
sharply with Glennie's own childhood, which, for a long time, was
practically devoid of music.</TE>
<TE>   "I was brought up in the northeast of Scotland, where music did
not play a huge part at all in my family life," Glennie remembers. "I
was brought up in a farming community. We didn't go to concerts.</TE>
<TE>   "Music was not played in the house. My father didn't know anything
about classical music or anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   A pair of events changed her outlook forever.</TE>
<TE>   A mysterious illness--no one is sure exactly what--left Glennie
with nerve damage so drastic that she became largely deaf. She could
still hear some human speech and other sounds. A ringing telephone,
for example, registered as a kind of crackle, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, she met a music teacher who introduced her to
percussion, and Glennie fell in love with it. She quickly learned the
basic mechanics of playing, but the teacher pushed her further,
showing her how to create with her instrument--how to improvise, how
to write a piece of music. "He saw us as musicians first and
instrumentalists second," Glennie says.</TE>
<TE>   She learned to read lips and pay attention to vibrations. While
her percussion teacher played notes on the timpani, she would press
her hands against the classroom wall to feel the difference in pitch
and volume.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Glennie managed to distinguish rough tones by
associating a pitch with where on her body she felt the vibrations.
Low sounds she feels in her legs and feet; the high sounds might
register on her face, neck and chest. Music became as much a physical
and emotional experience as an aural one, hence the birth of her
musical philosophy--that sound is "experienced," not just heard.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Glennie has gone on to collaborate with some of
music's most creative forces, including singer Bjork.</TE>
<TE>   As for her show on Saturday, she has no doubt that every listener
will hear--and feel, and see--something different.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all experience a particular concert from our own, tiny
little space," Glennie says. "We all hear quite differently. You
might get 10 [people] lined up, and their hearing ranges are going to
be so varied that sometimes even the very moods they are in will
change how they hear."</TE>

Saturday, 11 a.m., at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand
Ave., downtown L.A. $10-$12. She also performs with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic today and Saturday at 8 p.m. $12-$78. (213) 365-3500.</TE>

<DH>TV's 'All in the Family' and 'Star Trek TNG' are on DVD.</DH>

<LD>A classic comedy series, two popular syndicated fantasy series and
several plays adapted for the small screen arrive this week on DVD
and VHS.</LD>
<LD>   Columbia TriStar is releasing the first complete season of Norman
Lear's groundbreaking sitcom "All in the Family," on a three-disc DVD
set ($25) chronicling the antics of the late Carroll O'Connor as the
outspoken Archie Bunker; Jean Stapleton as his sweet wife, Edith;
Sally Struthers as their daughter, Gloria; and Rob Reiner as their
son-in-law, Mike, known as Meathead.</LD>
<LD>   The good news is that the series is just as funny and perceptive
today as when it premiered on CBS in 1971. The bad news: There are no
extras, save for English and Spanish subtitles and episode
selections. This set cries out for commentary from Lear and the three
surviving stars or even a documentary catching up with the creative
team today.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paramount is on a one-year mission to release the entire "Star
Trek: The Next Generation" series on DVD. The first season landed in
stores this week as a seven-disc collector's set (no suggested retail
price), containing all 26 episodes from the 1987-88 premiere season,
plus four informative documentaries created for the DVD. Paramount
will release subsequent seasons every other month.</TE>
<TE>   The new documentaries featured on the collector's set:</TE>
<TE>   * "The Beginning," which looks at the challenges of creating the
new series. Included are vintage interviews with creator Gene
Roddenberry (who discusses the genesis of the project and why he did
the show for syndication instead of for network TV), stars Patrick
Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn
and Denise Crosby.</TE>
<TE>   * "Selected Crew Analysis" features interviews with the cast, both
during the first season and after the series ended.</TE>
<TE>   * "The Making of the Legend" focuses on the production staff
members, including Michael Westmore (makeup), Herman Zimmerman
(production designer), Mike Okuda (scenic artist) and Dan Curry
(visual effects).</TE>
<TE>   "Memorable Missions" features the reminiscences of cast and crew
regarding specific episodes from the first season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like "The Next Generation," "Xena: Warrior Princess" also found
great success in syndication. During its seven-season run, the
adventures of the fearless warrior princess (Lucy Lawless) and her
sidekick Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor) were seen in more than 115
countries. USA is offering the two-hour finale, "A Friend in Need,"
on video ($15) and DVD ($25).</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a photo gallery, a rather ho-hum
behind-the-scenes featurette and passable commentary from executive
producer-director Rob Tapert, Lawless (who is married to Tapert) and
O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kultur Video has partnered with the Broadway Theatre Archives to
present 20 titles from the archives' series of vintage plays produced
for television ($25 for DVD and VHS).</TE>
<TE>   Included in the first five titles being released this week is
"Awake and Sing!," a 1972 PBS adaptation of Clifford Odets' seminal
1935 Broadway play about a Jewish family living in a tenement in the
Bronx during the Depression. Staged by Norman Lloyd, the drama stars
a superb Walter Matthau as a cynical boarder who lost his leg in
World War I. Ruth Storey, Felicia Farr, Ron Rifkin, Robert Lipton,
Martin Ritt and Milton Seltzer also star.</TE>
<TE>   From 1966 is "The Human Voice," an ABC adaptation of Jean
Cocteau's searing one-character drama about a middle-aged woman
trying to win back her ex-lover during a phone conversation. Ingrid
Bergman is a revelation as the woman who discovers her ex is calling
from his young fiancee's home.</TE>
<TE>   Also from 1966 is the PBS production of "Journey of the Fifth
Horse," by Ronald Ribman. A pre-"The Graduate" Dustin Hoffman
re-creates his award-winning off-Broadway role as a nebbish worker in
a publishing house. Charlotte Rae, Michael Tolan and Susan Anspach
are also in the cast.</TE>
<TE>   The other two releases are CBS' Emmy Award-winning production of
"Death of a Salesman," with Lee J. Cobb and the musical "June Moon"
with Jack Cassidy, featuring a cameo by composer Stephen Sondheim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The box cover of the digital edition of "Conspiracy" (HBO, $25)
advertises that the disc includes audio commentary from director
Frank Pierson. However, there is no commentary to be found on the DVD
of the award-winning fact-based drama about the 1942 clandestine
meeting about the Nazi high command that finalized the plans for
Adolf Hitler's "final solution." The disc does include two short but
interesting mini-documentaries featuring interviews with stars
Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth and director Pierson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Universal may have made an error releasing "Slap Shot 2: Breaking
the Ice" ($27 for DVD; VHS priced for rental) the same week as "Slap
Shot: The 25th Anniversary Special Edition" ($27). Written by Nancy
Dowd and directed by George Roy Hill, 1977's "Slap Shot" is a rude,
crude and very funny sports comedy starring Paul Newman as the aging
player-coach of a dreadful hockey team. "Slap Shot 2," which stars
Stephen Baldwin and Gary Busey, is rude, crude and witless.</TE>
<TE>   The only things the two have in common are the Hanson Brothers
(Steve Carlson, Jeff Carlson and David Hanson), who play the
down-and-dirty bespectacled hockey brothers. Unfortunately, they
appear only intermittently in "Slap Shot 2."</TE>
<TE>   The DVD of "Slap Shot" features classic scenes with the Hansons,
an interview with the Hansons and commentary by the Hansons. Let's
just say the disc is a bit too Hanson-heavy. The digital edition of
"Slap Shot 2" includes a standard making-of mini-documentary,
production notes and even more interviews with the Hansons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new from Universal is the digital edition of the fantasy
drama "K-Pax" ($27), starring Kevin Spacey as a mental patient who
claims he's from a distant planet and Jeff Bridges as his
understanding shrink. The serviceable digital edition includes
several deleted scenes (mostly featuring Bridges), a passable
behind-the-scenes documentary, atmospheric black-and-white photos
that Bridges shot during production and decent commentary from the
film's soft-spoken director, the aptly named Iain Softley.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MGM is releasing on DVD both the R-rated theatrical version and
the unrated director's cut of the overheated melodrama "Original Sin"
($27), starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. This tale of
love, lust and murder is based on a Cornell Woolrich novel and was
filmed before as "The Mississippi Mermaid" by Francois Truffaut.</TE>
<TE>   The unrated version contains the very steamy love scene between
Banderas and Jolie that had been trimmed significantly from the
released version to get an R rating. In his audio commentary,
writer-director Michael Cristofer goes into detail on how the nude
love scene was filmed and how "brave" the actors were in doing such
an intimate scene on camera.</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition of the unrated version includes a photo
gallery, trailer and a music video by Gloria Estefan. The R-rated DVD
does not include audio commentary.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every now and then, I roll the dice and follow the recommendations of
readers who've written to tout their favorite restaurants. This is
hardly high-stakes gambling, though, and I've yet to be disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes you find great food in unlikely locations. A case in
point: Maria's Restaurante Tacuba in the Target Center in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   It's mostly a carry-out operation--you order at the counter, and
the dining area is spartan. (And sorry, no margaritas.)</LD>
<TE>   While there's nothing much on the menu in the way of exotic
regional specialties, the food has a refreshing, home-cooked quality
and tastes as if it's made from recipes that have been handed down
for a few generations.</TE>
<TE>   Carne asada, for example, is not exactly an endangered culinary
species in these parts, but Tacuba's grilled beef is the best I've
had in a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Part of what distinguishes it is the quality of the meat. Rather
than the usual (and usually leathery) skirt steak, this is a high
grade of flank steak carved into long, ropy strands, grilled to
perfection, with just the right amount of char. The meat is
pleasingly chewy, but not tough, and packed with flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The carnitas are endowed with similar virtues. These gorgeous
hunks of pork are beautifully roasted to give them a sturdy sheath of
caramelized crust that gives way to tender, juicy meat within. Biting
into them, I had the feeling their preparers had tapped into the
ancestral culinary memory of abuelas from time immemorial. Also good
is the adobado, cubed pork in a piquant red sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a prank, I ordered the spiced goat, thinking I'd test
the limits of my party's gastronomic boundaries. Wrong. These tender
chunks of mild-tasting goat meat, which swim in a soupy red chile
sauce hinting of cloves and thyme, disappeared like crazy. The
grilled snapper was overdone and over-salted, but the shrimp tacos,
doused with a fiery sauce of creme fraiche and chipotle peppers, were
wonderful. All in all, this struck me as simple Mexican home cooking
at its best.</TE>
<TE>   Maria's Restaurante Tacuba is inexpensive. Tacos are $1.75,
burritos $4.50 and combination plates $4.20 to $7.50.</TE>
<TE>   Maria's Restaurante Tacuba, Target Center, 3314 S. Bristol St.,
Santa Ana, (714) 241-1297. Open 1 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, I was ready to indulge in the more garish
pleasures of Tex-Mex food in all its glorious excess. Bring on the
melted cheese and pass the Lipitor, amigos! The Chili Pepper in
Orange had been recommended by several transplanted Texans for its
Tex-Mex food, which it delivers in fine form, along with a good deal
more.</TE>
<TE>   With its cutesy but certainly cheerful decor--whitewashed faux
adobe, colorful murals, hanging plants--the Chili Pepper might seem
like just another bathtub margarita place, but it's not. The menu is
sprawling and the place does high-volume business, but the kitchen
isn't cooking by the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   I'm thinking particularly of a simple dish announced as "jalapeno
soup," which I'm going to try to re-create in my kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The waiter told me the recipe is a secret, but my unscientific
analysis is that it's basically potato soup laced with roasted,
pureed jalapenos. At any rate, it's thick and silky, and carries a
screaming high note of chile.</TE>
<TE>   On another visit, the soup was a rich pozole heavily dosed with a
flavorful but sinus-clearing chile de arbol sauce.</TE>
<TE>   I found one of the best chimichangas I've ever tasted here, a
husky specimen that delivered all the right guilty pleasures: crunchy
shell, gooey cheese topping, savory carne asada filling.</TE>
<TE>   However, the other offerings in this category were uneven. The
carnitas are good, but the beef enchiladas and chiles rellenos are
humdrum, and the best you can say for the margaritas is that they're
big.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I like the chicken a la diabla, chunks of chicken breast
doused with a sharp red chile sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The chicken Jalapa--chunks of chicken again but this time in
slightly tangy tomatillo sauce served on a bed of rice--is pure
comfort food.</TE>
<TE>   The Chili Pepper also distinguishes itself with a wide selection
of fish. On one visit, I had perfectly grilled mahi mahi, tender and
flaky, which needed only a squeeze of lemon juice to make it
complete. It came with especially good refried black beans, creamy
and pleasingly smoky.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, I had dry, overdone grilled yellowtail but a
lovely dish of shrimp baked in foil along with a red chile sauce
that, because it tastes like it's based in a brown roux, reminds me
of a Mexican cousin to shrimp Creole, though it's not served on rice.</TE>
<TE>   So while the Chili Pepper is a good place to satisfy your
yearnings for Tex-Mex food, it's more than that. This menu roves into
inventive and sometimes surprising territory.</TE>
<TE>   The Chili Pepper is inexpensive. Appetizers run $4.55 to $6.95,
entrees and combinations $4.95 to $9.95.</TE>
<TE>   The Chili Pepper, 167 S. Main St., Orange, (714) 639-2840. Open
10:30 a.m.- 9 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturdays-Sundays.</TE>

<HD>Disappointing Prospects From 'Young Man'</HD>
<DH>Review* Despite a good cast, questions linger in this
production of the Horton Foote play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK CHALON SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Horton Foote's dramas, seldom seen in these parts, get an unveiling
this month with two premieres.</LD>
<LD>   There's the world premiere of "Getting Frankie Married--and
Afterwards" at South Coast Repertory this weekend, and last Friday
the Newport Theatre Arts Center staged "The Young Man From Atlanta"
in Orange County for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope "Getting Frankie Married" leaves a bigger Foote-print.
"Young Man From Atlanta," despite winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1995,
is disappointing.</LD>
<TE>   Some critics have wondered how this only mildly interesting play
could have hauled in such a major award, and this Arts Center
production, which lasts through April 21, does nothing to ease the
head-scratching.</TE>
<TE>   Foote, probably best known as the screenwriter of "To Kill a
Mockingbird" and "Tender Mercies," sets "The Young Man From Atlanta"
in his favorite milieu, the South of the go-go '50s, when every big
city dreamed of being bigger. But this blustery optimism is spoiled
for one family. Will Kidder (Jack Messenger) busies himself with
plans for a new home and a fancy car for his wife, Lily Dale (Harriet
Whitmyer), until he's fired from his executive job. Hanging over this
is the far greater loss of his son, who recently drowned.</TE>
<TE>   There are whispers of suicide and fretful references to the
character of the title, the son's roommate who persistently tries to
connect with the Kidders. Is he out for money or does his devotion
hint that he was more than just good friends with the son? Will, who
has heart trouble on top of all this, isn't eager to find out. Since
the Young Man is only talked about mysteriously and never does
appear, we have to do our own guesswork.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it's time for the Kidders to learn what's really
important in life and Foote goes about showing them, in fits and
starts. The inspiration is obviously Arthur Miller's "Death of a
Salesman," but "The Young Man From Atlanta" lacks the lyricism or
passion to breathe fire into this familiar tale of the soured
American Dream. It feels commonplace, and our attention drifts away.</TE>
<TE>   Director Phyllis Gitlin also has trouble with tone at the Arts
Center. At times the drama has the gravity it needs but too often
there's the forced conviviality of an "Ozzie and Harriet" episode.
That's overstating it, of course, but when Messenger casts a peeved
look at the cowed Whitmyer and huffs around as if she just served him
burnt toast for breakfast, it feels trivial and awkward against the
serious events unfolding around them.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, Gitlin is faced with balancing the play's deeper
message (which is, I think, to pick yourself up, dust yourself off
and get on with it, no matter how bad things seem) against the
occasional humor. You laugh when the sweet and silly Lily Dale goes
on about national conspiracies concocted by Eleanor Roosevelt, but it
doesn't blend with the whole.</TE>
<TE>   The cast is capable but was patchy during Friday's opening night.
Whitmyer was the most watchable, especially when she had the
opportunity to reveal something of the pain and confusion under Lily
Dale's gay surface. There was also some solid work in this un-solid
environment from supporting actors Patricia Newman (as the live-in
help, Clara), Seymour Schwartz (Lily Dale's stepfather) and Simon
Panczyk (Carson, a visiting relative).</TE>
<TE>   "The Young Man From Atlanta," Newport Theatre Arts Center, 2501
Cliff Drive, Newport Beach. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays,
2:30 p.m. $13. Ends April 21. (949) 631-0288.</TE>

<HD>Double Dose of Humor Ideal for Opera Skeptics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a healthy way, the recent musical doubleheader at Ventura College
was ideal for those who don't like--or are at least skeptical
of--opera. The Ventura College Opera Workshop wisely chose a path of
operatic levity, putting on Mozart's frothily satirical piece "The
Impresario," and PDQ Bach's frequently hilarious "Oedipus Tex."
Although distinct in musical language and era, with roughly 200 years
separating the two, each is a short and smart bit of opera theater,
dipping into humor both broad and refined.</LD>
<LD>   Director Dean Lundquist coyly localized "The Impresario," with
references to the budget woes of this opera company and the
impresario Mr. Scruples (Robert E. "Doc" Reynolds) making references
to an impending retirement in Ojai. But its sendup of the dubious
machinations of art and commerce need no update and are probably more
timely now than in the 18th century.</LD>
<LD>   Its plot swirls around ego-clashing, dueling would-be divas,
wonderfully sung by Patricia Lathrop-McPherson as Madame Goldentrill
and Jill Walker-Guth as the aspiring Miss Silverpeal. In the
periphery is the young reluctant impresario-to-be, Mr. Bluff (Steven
Cox), and the patron with loin-level ulterior motives, Mr. Angel.
That role was sung by David Hodgson, who also returned as the
swaggering, drawling protagonist of "Oedipus Tex."</LD>
<TE>   The work of PDQ Bach (a.k.a. Peter Schickele) effectively mixes
high culture and comic high jinks in his revisited Oedipal tale.
Incestuous trouble arises when Tex falls for Billie Jo Casta (sung
with great garish glee by extra-lipsticked Suzannah Underwood).</TE>
<TE>   High-minded campiness rules, as the gloomily clad Greek chorus
sings fervently, and relentlessly, about "tragedy," and the
principals do their work amid chaps, hats and spring-loaded eyeballs.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, the chorus sings "The Eyes of Texas" while the
orchestra (conducted by Marc D. Williams) plays "Jesu, Joy of Man's
Desiring."</TE>
<TE>   With luck, this wonderful show chipped away at the prejudices of
resident opera-phobes, boding well for the future of opera in these
parts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Close-Up Theater: Opening this weekend in the inimitable and
intimate Theater 150 in Ojai is writer-performer Chris Wells'
"Liberty," an irreverent romp through New York and that other place
attached to it, America. Bridget Carpenter is the director and Fred
Cassidy the composer.</TE>
<TE>   * "Liberty," opening Friday, Theater 150, 918 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai.
Friday and Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 7 p.m. Ends April 7. $15. (805)
646-4300.</TE>

<TE>   Ojai Alert: The Ojai Festival, always a highlight of Ventura
County's cultural calendar, has officially announced its program.
While the festival is departing from tradition in the sense of not
having a resident orchestra this year--partly a budgetary
decision--the menu of chamber music should be enticing enough to
bring the usual music-loving hordes to Ojai from May 29 to June 2.</TE>
<TE>   The stars of this year's festival will be the esteemed Emerson
String Quartet, performing the last quartets of Beethoven and
Shostakovich over two separate concerts, as well as noted vocalist
Ute Lemper, guitarist Eliot Fisk, and--from the up-and-comer's
corner--the critically acclaimed young Italian pianist Mario
Formenti. It all opens with a marathon concert, from 6 p.m. to
midnight May 29 at the Ojai Center for the Arts, and continues
through the weekend at the Libbey Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   A heads-up: the Los Angeles Philharmonic will return to the
festival in 2003, led by the great maestro Pierre Boulez, whose
several visits to Ojai have resulted in some of the memorable
programs there.</TE>

<HD>A Report Puts Testing in Schools to the Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sides in the sometimes hysterical debate over testing in our
nation's public schools are well-established.</LD>
<LD>   Many educators, and some parents, protest that judging schools by
their test scores undermines learning as well as teaching,
substituting memorization and drilling. Supporters, including
President Bush and some key Democrats, contend that tests are an
accountability tool that forces schools to analyze their practices to
improve on their shortcomings.</LD>
<LD>   But as John Merrow's uneven "Frontline" documentary that airs on
PBS tonight makes plain, the issue is too complex for those pro or
con formulations. The hourlong report, "Testing Our Schools," is
keyed to the recent passage of the federal education reform
legislation advocated by the Bush administration. The centerpiece of
that law is testing of students in reading and math in the third
through eighth grades and the attachment of consequences for
sustained poor performance.</LD>
<TE>   Merrow, as usual, does his homework in raising pertinent questions
about the strategy. Are tests accurate enough? Are some types of
tests better than others? Do they cover the right topics? Do tests
measure the effectiveness of teaching or the relative affluence of
the students who take them? What's the connection between students'
motivation and their scores?</TE>
<TE>   The answers he offers are, necessarily, still tentative. But even
as he raises the issues, Merrow provides fodder for the backers of
testing. He shows us two schools in Virginia where the efforts of
educators devoted to teaching students the state standards are paying
off in dramatic fashion. And in interviews with teachers in Richmond,
where few students pass state exams, he showcases what President Bush
calls the "bigotry of low expectations."</TE>
<TE>   A high school teacher says it's "ridiculous" to think that poor
children could learn the same material as their better-off peers. And
a kindergarten teacher says she resents "the pressure and the stress"
that's put on educators to raise test scores "when everybody knows
children do not learn the same way or at the same rate."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA education professor emeritus James Popham concludes that
testing, if done properly, "can be a powerful force ... for getting
kids to learn what they ought to learn." That, he says, will ensure
public education's survival. Done badly, however, an overemphasis on
testing is a recipe for "absolute failure."</TE>
<TE>   "Testing Our Schools" airs at 9 tonight on "Frontline" on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Phil Names Jazz Leader</HD>
<DH>Music* As the orchestra unveils its Hollywood Bowl
schedule, it announces singer Dianne Reeves' new two-year post.</DH>

<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic announced Wednesday that jazz singer
Dianne Reeves has been appointed to the newly created post of
creative chair for jazz. In addition, the orchestra unveiled the
schedule for the Hollywood Bowl season beginning June 28, which marks
the start of Reeves' tenure with the orchestra In an interview,
Philharmonic executive vice president and managing director Deborah
Borda said that Reeves, who lives in Denver, is the first in what the
orchestra hopes will be a series of jazz artists who will serve as
"visiting professors" for two-year periods, to advise the orchestra
on jazz programming. Reeves, a Detroit native who launched her
singing career in L.A , performed at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in
Salt Lake City. These artists, Borda said, "will work with us
year-round, as we move toward Walt Disney Concert Hall, as well as
for the Bowl, [as] we assemble a truly cohesive jazz program with a
point of viewThis approach represents a departure from the
Philharmonic's previous arrangement with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz
Orchestra, which was brought in as the Bowl's resident jazz group by
former Philharmonic executive director Willem Wijnbergen in 1998. The
orchestra's contract expired at the end of 2001 Bowl season. Reeves'
programming input will not be felt this summer because the 2002 Bowl
season was designed in advance of her appointment. But Bowl audiences
will get the chance to hear her sing as one of the artists in the
Wednesday Jazz at the Bowl series on July 17. That concert, a salute
to Billie Holiday, will also feature Oleta Adams and Tom Wopat,
accompanied by the Terence Blanchard Quintet. Other jazz series
concerts include performances by Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole, Chick
Corea, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band and a
one-time appearance by the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. The
season kicks off in June with the annual Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame
gala with fireworks, in a program featuring the L.A. Philharmonic
conducted by music director Esa-Pekka Salonen. The concert supports
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.'s education program, Music
Matters. This year's classical music concerts include performances by
the Philharmonic, with Salonen conducting four concerts in August,
the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the
Russian National Orchestra. Guest soloists include baritone Thomas
Quasthoff, flutist James Galway, pianist Emanual Ax, classical
guitarist Christopher Parkening, soprano Susan Graham, and violinists
Jaime Laredo, Leila Josefowicz and Gil Shaham. Among this year's
concerts are three performances celebrating the Fourth of July, with
John Williams conducting the Philharmonic and a guest appearance by
James Taylor; the annual "Big Picture" movie night, this year
honoring the 75th anniversary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences; and the Bowl debut of Mexican singer and film star Pepe
Aguilar. The Bowl's Weekend Spectaculars series include a Celtic
Celebration with the Chieftains; vocalist Audra McDonald in a
Gershwin tribute; and the Canadian Cirque Eloize, combining circus,
dance and classical music. Offerings from the Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra, conducted by John Mauceri, include a staged adaptation of
Meredith Willson's "The Music Man" starring Eric McCormack and
Kristin Chenoweth; a concert performance of Puccini's "La Boheme"; a
tribute concert for the city of New York; and movie music concerts
with works by Elmer Bernstein, Alex North and "Lord of the Rings"
Oscar winner Howard Shore. KCRW's Sunday World Festival series
continues this summer, featuring Erykah Badu with Zap Mama, Keali'i
Reichel, Les Grands Ballets de Tahiti, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, Burning
Spear, Ozomatli, Hugh Masekela and Eddie Palmieri, Lauryn Hill, Steel
Pulse, Gal Costa, Dori Caymmi and others. For a schedule, call (323)

his idol to sign.</LD>

<TE>   The rocker, Violent J from the metal-rap band Insane Clown Posse,

pugnacious pundit Bill O'Reilly was far from amused.</TE>
<TE>   As host of Fox News Channel's nightly political slugfest "The
O'Reilly Factor," he has sat across from plenty of clowns in his
time, but it's the threat, O'Reilly says, is posed by acts like ICP

tonight's disturbing special, "The Corruption of the American Child"
(9 p.m., Fox).</TE>
<TE>   "Never before have so many corrupting influences descended upon
young people at one time," says O'Reilly, who goes on to build a
strong case with filmed segments and face-to-face confrontations with
such notables as rap mogul Russell Simmons, Jack Valenti of the
Motion Picture Assn. of America and Linda McMahon, chief executive of
the World Wrestling Federation.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly says up front that preteens should find something else to
do for the next hour, but it's a program their parents can't afford
to miss.</TE>

<KH>SURROUNDINGS / COLMA</KH>
<HD>Where Neighbors Are Very, Very Quiet</HD>
<DH>Founded after San Francisco banned interments and
graveyards, town is home to 17 burial grounds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The town of Colma is packed with 1.5 million people, but you'd hardly
know it, since only 1,190 of them are living. The rest are what they
refer to here as "the silent majority," the permanent residents in a
city made up almost entirely of graveyards.</LD>
<LD>   Quiet? Colma is ... pick your punch line: It's like a tomb. It's
downright dead. It's the only town in America--the world,
probably--where cemeteries outnumber supermarkets 17 to none. There
are no public schools, no hotels and no libraries. There's not a
single soccer or baseball field.</LD>
<LD>   The only bar is Historical Old Molloy's, a wood-sided,
120-year-old saloon that stands next door to a headstone retailer and
faces a hillside full of graves. Yellowed newspaper pages decorate
the tavern's walls. One details a growth spurt some years back that
bumped the ambulatory population from 580 to 1,000.</LD>
<TE>   "Colma Comes to Life," the headline says. The reporter wrote at
length of the town's resurrection.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, this tiny suburb south of San Francisco--2.2 square
miles--will never be noted for anything but a final resting place.
Monument stores dot the two main thoroughfares, El Camino Real and
Old Mission Road, like so many burger joints. There's practically a
flower shop on every corner.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everybody lives within a block or two of a cemetery," said
Mayor Helen Fisicaro, who lives across the street from one. Vice
Mayor Frossanna "Fro" Vallerga goes her one better: She lives in a
cemetery. Her husband, Larry, is the superintendent at a place called
Eternal Home. All the Vallergas need to do to see the headstones is
look out the dining room window.</TE>
<TE>   Colma is so utterly steeped in death that residents have no choice
but to live with it. They crack jokes. They talk about the wonderful
green space and an eerie sort of beauty you can't find anywhere else.
The carved angels and stars and crosses and obelisks and statues of
Christ that stretch in rows across the sloping lawns are like
Renaissance museum pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Older sections of cemeteries are crowded with personal vaults and
family mausoleums dating to the early 1900s. Elaborate structures,
with marble columns and granite pediments, they resemble federal
buildings shrunk to the size of single-car garages. You couldn't
build them today--they would cost more than $1 million apiece.</TE>
<TE>   In the Catacombs at Cypress Lawn, immense stained-glass ceilings
cast a jade light over long aisles stacked six high with bodies. Some
of the corpses are embalmed and hidden by square bronze nameplates.
Others, cremated, are kept behind glass in metal urns that have the
look of yachting trophies--cups with graceful handles and tapered
necks. The engraved names evoke the impression of long-ago champions.</TE>
<TE>   "The only ghost story I ever heard was about [the Catacombs],"
said Patricia Hatfield, president of the Colma Historical Society. An
alarm went off and the guard found a door ajar. Then he heard the
sound of a baby crying. Then more babies--a chorus of them, from the
area where dead children are buried--and he reacted the way you would
expect him to react: He frantically locked up and left.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'My hair stood right up on end,'" Hatfield recalled.</TE>
<TE>   A resident of Colma for half a century, Hatfield is the
acknowledged authority on the town. A tourism poster hangs over her
desk: "The flowers are in bloom! It's time to visit your loved ones
in Colma." Not only does Hatfield know where the bodies are buried,
she will take the time to show you.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball great Joe DiMaggio lies in a black granite vault at Holy
Cross Catholic Cemetery. Fans have left scuffed baseballs, a plastic
bat and a framed obituary.</TE>
<TE>   Dodge City lawman Wyatt Earp rests next to his wife at Hills of
Eternity, under his third headstone. The first two, Hatfield said,
were stolen, although one was later recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Imposing classical columns grace a family mausoleum at Cypress
Lawn that is unmarked by any name. Inside are members of the Hearst
clan, including famed publisher William Randolph.</TE>
<TE>   "I call us the United Nations of cemeteries," Hatfield said. "We
have Italian and Greek and Serbian and Japanese and Chinese
cemeteries. We have Catholic, we have Jewish, we have
nondenominational. We have a cemetery for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Even the animals have one. Pets' Rest, run by a man named Phil
C'de Baca, who lives on the premises, looks much like any other
except the graves are three feet long and marked by wooden dog
biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   Dogs and cats fill most of the 13,000 plots, but there are also
six kinds of monkeys, several wolves, a cheetah, exotic birds, snakes
and iguanas. C'de Baca remembers one family that reserved the
cemetery chapel to hold services for a dark, foot-long fish, somberly
buried in a pine box. "They burnt some incense and said some
prayers," he said. Some delay a burial for days and stop by to visit
a beloved pet, C'de Baca said. "They'll come and pick it up and walk
around with it. Some people have a real difficult time letting go."</TE>
<TE>   Colma was incorporated in 1924 to serve as a necropolis for San
Francisco after two city laws made the town necessary. One law banned
new burials inside San Francisco's boundaries. The other outlawed
existing graveyards. The court battle lasted 20 years, Hatfield said.
But in the end, thousands of bodies were dug up and hauled to Colma.</TE>
<TE>   Urban growth has pushed into Colma in recent years. There's now an
auto mall, a card club and a Cineplex. A Kmart remains open. There
are two Home Depots.</TE>
<TE>   But you're still as likely to be stopped by a funeral procession
as by a traffic light. These are the newcomers arriving. They fill
mausoleums, not apartment houses. Dozens every day take up residence
in tiny parcels on newly developed hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Each plot has its own history. Near sundown, the mausoleum at Holy
Cross is gloomy and dank, with miles of stacked bodies. Your echoing
footsteps are the only sound as you navigate the forbidding labyrinth
to find the crypt occupied coffee heiress Abigail Folger, murdered in
1969 by followers of Charles Manson.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, assassinated in his office in
1978, is not far away. Levi Strauss, the blue jeans king, is one of
the luminaries of Colma. So is Claus Spreckles, the sugar mogul, and
Harry "the Horse" Flambouris, a member of the Hells Angels, killed
execution-style and buried along with his Harley-Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't tell anybody where," Hatfield said, "because they're
worried somebody will dig up the Harley."</TE>

<HD>Church of the People, Not of the Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD L. BECK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Roman Catholic Church gathers to celebrate the holiest week
of its year, it isn't looking too holy. As a priest, I have read the
news of sexual scandals involving priests and bishops with sadness
and dismay. I don't recognize the church depicted in the media as the
one in which I minister or one I even know.</LD>
<LD>   I've wondered if I, too, have been duped these 17 years that I
have presided at the holy altar. Is there some subterranean church of
pederasts and conspirators that has managed to elude my theologically
honed ecclesiastical radar? Who are these demonic predators described
in newspapers? Where is the church of justice and rectitude to which
I have given my life, the church whose initiation by Jesus we
commemorate during these high holy days?</LD>
<LD>   The church is where it has always been: in the people of God, not
in the trappings of hierarchical mendacity and excess.</LD>
<TE>   The priests and bishops and hierarchy exist only for the purpose
of serving the faithful and helping to facilitate their way to God.
When they fail to do that, the people of God have the imperative to
rise up and demand accountability and reform. That is exactly what
they have begun to do.</TE>
<TE>   It is about time. And it is about grace.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the current ecclesiastical morass may well be a time of
blessing and growth for a church mired in centuries of outdated
governance and accumulated arrogance. Conservative Catholic
newspapers have questioned the relevance of priestly celibacy when
some priests themselves no longer seem convinced of its value.
Talking heads have debated the wisdom of an obviously flawed all-male
priesthood when qualified women wait in the wings to help relieve a
vocational crisis sure to be exacerbated by this scandal.</TE>
<TE>   But there are even more important changes possible as the cracks
in the Rock of Peter become glaringly obvious. The faithful might
finally begin to take back ownership of their church.</TE>
<TE>   Priests and bishops may at last be held accountable to those whom
they serve or risk the defection of people and money to places of
safe harbor and true spiritual comfort. The possibility of a new age
dawns if it is not eclipsed by continued arrogance and unwarranted
moral superiority.</TE>
<TE>   As a priest, I have been blessed with immersion in the church of
the people rather than the one of the princes. I don't personally
know any pedophile priests, and I believe, as most reports indicate,
that they are a minority, equivalent in number to that of the general
population. Given their positions of trust and moral authority,
however, the errant priests' despicable actions inflame more virulent
ire than do the crimes of the common pedophile. So they should. More
is expected of those to whom more has been given.</TE>
<TE>   We know that pedophile priests exist and that they have caused
unspeakable harm and inconsolable heartache. The innocent victims
must be compensated and helped in dealing with the lifelong scars
inflicted. And justice must be served.</TE>
<TE>   But might the sin of the perpetrators also be an opportunity of
grace for those of us who believe that reform and rebirth are
possible from failure? Haven't each of us known the beckoning balm of
renewal in the midst of our own sin and shortcomings?</TE>
<TE>   As churches gather today, Holy Thursday, to commemorate Christ's
Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist and the priesthood,
may they be encouraged by the recent debacle to celebrate another
kind of priesthood, the priesthood of all the faithful, with the hope
that its long overdue institution might lead the way out of scandal
to Easter resurrection and new life.</TE>

<HD>Turn the Spotlight on Land Mines</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has looked to Hollywood for
help in burnishing the United States' image around the world.
Remember roving ambassador Karl Rove taking a meeting in Beverly
Hills with the entertainment industry's heaviest hitters back in
November? As so often happens in the film business, the initial pitch
generated a lot of buzz, then "Untitled White House Project" found
itself languishing in development hell.</LD>
<LD>   This week, however, Tinsel Town has turned the spotlight on the
importance of banning land mines--a move that would help the United
States win foreign friends and influence the widespread perception of
us as unfeeling bullies.</LD>
<LD>   First, on Oscar night, Bosnia's "No Man's Land" was the surprise
winner of the best foreign-language film award. A withering antiwar
satire, the film centers on the travails of a wounded Bosnian soldier
who finds himself, in a postmodern dilemma worthy of Samuel Beckett,
lying on a land mine booby-trapped to explode if he gets up.</LD>
<TE>   Then, this week's "The West Wing" featured a plot line in which
the newly named U.S. poet laureate chastises the White House for not
signing the international treaty banning land mines. Her conviction
stems from a searing personal experience, watching a father and son
fishing in Bosnia. "The kid hooked a piece of garbage," she tells
communications director Toby Ziegler, "and when he tried to take it
off the line, it blew him up. Right in front of his father. And right
in front of me."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's creative convergence on this issue comes at a time
when the real West Wing is reviewing U.S. land mine policy. The U.S.
has refused to join the 142 nations that have signed the 1997 treaty
forbidding the use, stockpiling and production of antipersonnel land
mines--a devastating weapon that has proved far more effective at
killing and maiming innocent civilians than enemy troops. Since 1975,
land mines have killed more than 1 million people, far outstripping
the deaths caused by those well-publicized bugaboos, nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons. The buried bomblets claim 24,000
casualties a year, 95% of them civilians. Even more horrifying, 30%
are kids.</TE>
<TE>   What makes land mines so repugnant is their lethal and long-lived
promiscuity. Once sown in earth, they hold their grudges long after
the soldiers who planted them have left. Their bloody harvest can
sprout days, months, even decades after they have been laid. And
mines are an equal opportunity killer; they can't tell to which side
the soldier stepping on them belongs or if the footstep setting them
off is that of a child.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 80 million unexploded land mines buried across the
globe, and removing them is such a painstaking (and often deadly)
task that experts estimate it will take decades to get rid of them
all.</TE>
<TE>   For Danis Tanovic, who spent two years documenting real war
atrocities as a cameraman in Bosnia before writing and directing "No
Man's Land," making the public aware of such carnage is the only way
to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   "Bosnia was saved, thanks to journalists," he says. "People were
seeing what was happening; people were embarrassed by what they were
seeing."</TE>
<TE>   I had a similar reaction when I met with Jerry White, executive
director of Landmine Survivors Network, who gave me a simple but
powerful lesson. First he handed me a small, round bright-green
object, an actual land mine. Then, without warning, he showed me what
that innocent-looking device can do by unscrewing his prosthesis and
revealing the remains of what used to be his right leg. He lost it
when, as a student on a hiking trip in Israel, he stepped on a mine
that had been buried by Syrian soldiers 17 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The stories told by White, "No Man's Land" and this week's "West
Wing" should inspire us to do all we can to embarrass the president
into action: He should sign the land mine treaty now.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Easy to Bring Down a Dictator</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>YANGON, Myanmar</DL>
<LD>How encouraged we felt after watching the documentary, "Bringing Down
a Dictator," about the end of Slobodan Milosevic's rule. It was
previewed at a conference held in Virginia by the United States
Institute of Peace and the International Center on Nonviolent
Conflict (and will premiere on PBS on Sunday).</LD>
<LD>   That meeting gathered practitioners of nonviolence, some who had
already brought down their dictators--from nations such as Chile,
South Africa and my native Poland--and some from nations that have
yet to do it, such as Belarus, Iraq and Burma, renamed Myanmar by its
military rulers. By the end of the conference I felt like a walking
encyclopedia of nonviolent ideas, strategies and tactics.</LD>
<LD>   Then I traveled to Burma. As a precaution I left behind the
materials from the conference and my precious copy of "Bringing Down
a Dictator." This was a wise move. Wise, too, is to leave behind all
those ideas about how nonviolence and civil society can easily bring
down a dictatorship. If every rule has an exception to confirm it,
then Burma is the ultimate exception to the rule about the immense
"power of the powerless," to paraphrase Vaclav Havel.</LD>
<TE>   The Burmese are kind and gentle people, so it is hard to watch
them so thoroughly subdued by the military regime. Although
dissenting ideas are easily found here, strong civil society is not.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, students inspired a general nonviolent revolt here, but
the generals clamped down. Two years later in the parliamentary
elections, 82% of the seats went to the opposition National League
for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, but the ruling junta
prevented the victors from taking office. Thus the Burmese believe
that even if they stand up to the regime, they may be crushed.
Meanwhile, the junta learned to nip in the bud whatever the civil
society may be planning. (Or the military brass: Witness the recent
sacking of three high-ranking officials suspected of being coup
plotters.) One way to do it is to impose extremely harsh punishments
for the slightest show of dissent (two actor brothers from Mandalay
got seven years behind bars for a joke, and a man got a 25-year
sentence for possessing an unregistered fax machine).</TE>
<TE>   Having a strong and unquestioned leader in Suu Kyi is a mixed
blessing, because she eclipses others in the movement. Civil society
in Burma is not sufficiently unified, organized, focused or powerful
enough to bring down a dictatorship or even diminish its power.</TE>
<TE>   So if there were any chance of this regime leaving the stage in a
peaceful way, it would not happen because of inside pressure. But it
may happen from a mixture of outside pressure and inside
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Since October 2000, this has been the reason for hope among the
Burmese and Burma-watchers. During 14 months of talks between the
generals and Suu Kyi, it has been them versus her, a far cry from the
round table of negotiators that spelled the end of communist rule in
Poland, but talk they do.</TE>
<TE>   The Burmese talks are negotiated by United Nations special envoy
Razali Ismail, but there's no word about progress other than it's
"going well." This is frustrating for the Burmese. Those inside the
country, more docile, cannot affect the outcome. Those outside call
for transparency, but that's doubtful. It is equally doubtful that if
any result is obtained, it will satisfy the Burmese or the regime,
for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   In Poland, where before the round-table process began, secret
talks were held between recently released political prisoners and the
hated generals who put them behind bars. The result was a less than
satisfactory agreement, but it was the only one on the table. It led
to unfree and unfair elections, but that ultimately proved to be a
more than satisfactory beginning to the peaceful end of communist
military dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   We can hope for the same in Burma. There are many ways to bring
down a dictator.</TE>

<LD>Law enforcement agencies must reconsider how they deal with fleeing
vehicles. The last two weeks have witnessed pursuits involving the
LAPD, the California Highway Patrol and the L.A. County Sheriff's
Department that have seriously injured an elderly couple out for a
walk, killed an 18-year-old girl and killed a fleeing suspect.</LD>
<LD>   All these agencies have pursuit policies that put safety first.
Yet these policies did not protect the latest victims and their
families from tragedy. Something more is needed: putting police
pursuits on the same level as police shootings, i.e., something used
only in the most extreme situations.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever someone is killed or injured in a pursuit, a question is
raised as to whether officers obeyed policy. In fact, officers
generally do obey their agencies' "safety first" policies. They just
don't interpret these policies in the same way as most of us do
because of the police culture in which they operate.</LD>
<TE>   This culture usually works in the public's favor by encouraging
officers to downplay danger and to take on the sometimes
life-threatening tasks they must to protect us. But the culture just
doesn't work as well when it comes to pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get one thing straight: When a fleeing vehicle crashes, the
driver is primarily to blame for any damage or injuries.
Officers--even officers pursuing a vehicle--do not force people to
drive dangerously. All the suspects have to do is stop.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality is that a pursuing police patrol often encourages
a fleeing driver to drive more dangerously. This poses a threat not
only to the suspect but to police officers, pedestrians and other
drivers. More than 60% of drivers who flee police in California have
committed nothing more serious than a misdemeanor, according to the
CHP. Yet these are among thousands of pursuits that contributed to a
toll that included 143 fatalities from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuit policies that fail to take account of police culture will
not maximize safety. Good policy--such as that used in most law
enforcement agencies regarding shootings--must leave no room for
misinterpretation: Pursuit must not be used with nonthreatening or
nonserious offenders. It is unacceptable to endanger life except in
the most extreme situations.</TE>
<TE>   This would mean that some less serious offenders would get away.
But it also would mean that fewer people would suffer the kinds of
tragedies that we have witnessed in recent days.</TE>

<LD>On a recent walk through my neighborhood, I came across an impromptu
art installation of the sort you see a lot of in New York's Greenwich
Village, the sort you suspect must be expressing a widely held local
view, because after several days, it hasn't been demolished or
defaced. It was a large pile of dog dung with a tiny American flag
stuck in it, fluttering ingloriously in the breeze.</LD>
<LD>   This is the general bohemian view, the one you hear most often
expressed in my corner of the world, which, granted, may be among the
most lefty in this country. Even the wealthy are mostly staunch
liberals; only Hollywood could compete, dollars for Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   And then, of course, there's the cultural elite, the intellectuals
and the artists, rich and poor. Many reside here and, as one
character in Edward Albee's new Broadway play "The Goat" put it, many
consider themselves to be more democratic than the Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   They do not consider themselves patriots. They wouldn't be caught
dead waving flags. Their views can be typified by the Nation
columnist Katha Pollit, who reported that she had told her daughter
that "the flag stands for jingoism and vengeance and war," and
novelist Barbara Kingsolver, who feels "alienated" by the flag
because she associates it primarily with war.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not everyone in my neighborhood feels this way. There
is the other extreme, and it is extreme. Even six months after the
Sept. 11 attacks, the curio shops are brimming with American flag
T-shirts, bandannas, napkins, ski hats, even oversized GI Joe dolls
that dance while singing "God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing all this, you'd almost think, along with the left elites,
that the American flag stands for nothing more than capitalism, that
patriotism equals consumerism.</TE>
<TE>   But is this what the flag stands for?</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't have to, any more than it has to stand for war and
jingoism and bigotry. If you go into the third- or fourth-generation
immigrant urban neighborhoods like the Rockaways in New York or South
Boston or the Hamtramck section of Detroit, you'll see an altogether
different kind of patriotism on display, one closer to the ideal than
either the ironic or the quick-buck versions, one that you'll also
find in small towns and suburbs across America.</TE>
<TE>   It's not ostentatious. It's not angry. It's not commercial. It's
just there; an unobtrusive, often weather-torn and faded flag,
perched over the porch or pasted in the smudged window, saying
something quite simple, not clever or hotheaded.</TE>
<TE>   When you talk to the shop owners and families who live and work in
these places, many will tell you the same thing: Their relationship
to their country is not unlike their relationship to their spouses or
family members. It's a love that persists through the ugly times and
encompasses the faults and failures of a government that is far from
perfect. It's a love that criticizes and fights against the human
mistakes that threaten our Bill of Rights.</TE>
<TE>   But it's also a love that imbues the flag with fair symbolism, a
balanced view of the good and the bad that might not prompt them to
wave it but could never induce them to burn it or stick it in a pile
of dog dung.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Mahony Should Name Abusers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mahony Won't Name Abusers," March 26: Since when did being a
member of the clergy entitle you to diplomatic immunity? Correct me
if I'm wrong, but when our founding fathers established a "separation
of church and state" it was to prevent the church from interfering in
the business of government. Never did they intend it to mean that
clergymen were above the law of the land.</LD>
<LD>   Today, if someone is guilty of sexual abuse involving children,
his/her name, address and likeness is published for all to see in the
interest of public safety. Am I to believe the public's safety is not
at risk because, in this case, these offenders were men of God? I
know the Bible teaches "Judge not, lest ye be judged," but by the
church's own admission, these men are guilty of sexually abusing
children. Is it up to Cardinal Roger Mahony or the state of
California to determine their punishment?</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Hull</LD>
<TE>   Chino Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, Mahony thinks it's all right to hide criminals. He knows of
several "older" retired priests who allegedly abused children, but
since it's so long ago and they are now (in his opinion) no longer a
threat to children, it's all right to just forgive and forget.</TE>
<TE>   I believe there is a term in the law for this action: abetting and
harboring a criminal.</TE>
<TE>   It's time the district attorney's office does its job. Mahony
should either hand over the names of these men or suffer the
consequences. A pedophile is a pedophile--whether a clergyman, truck
driver, schoolteacher or judge. And no pedophile, or anyone who
harbors him (or her--yes, women can be pedophiles) should be above
the law.</TE>

<TE>   I was deeply saddened by "Priest Fired as Head of School" (March
23), concerning the Rev. Dominic Savino and Crespi Carmelite High
School. Most important, the name of a great institution of learning
was tarnished. Having had two sons graduate from Crespi, I can attest
to the fine college-prep education they received. They also developed
strong moral ethics, a sense of fair play and a deep respect for
their teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The faculty of Crespi consists of committed men and women
dedicated to the religious, social and educational development of
their students. I credit this commitment for not only guiding my sons
from boys to men but also making them the gentlemen and scholars they
are today. I have every confidence that Crespi will carry on in this
tradition, today and in the years to come.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Sex Abuse by Clerics--a Crisis of Many Faiths," March 25:
Thank you for enlightening the public that child sexual abuse is not
solely a phenomenon of the Catholic clergy but is found in all
denominations. It happens among the married as well as the unmarried.
The most pitiful victims are those who suffer this abuse on a regular
basis in their own homes. Over 50% of all prosecuted cases are ones
that take place in the home.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for America to wake up to the fact that sexual abuse of
children is rampant in our society.</TE>

<LD>Re the March 26 letter by Deborah Nakamoto, on combining Veterans Day
and Memorial Day into one holiday: It is a very bad idea. They do not
both honor the same veterans, as she suggests. On Veterans Day we
honor all the men and women who served our country in the armed
forces. Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those brave men and
women who fought for our country but did not return home alive.</LD>
<LD>   We need to keep these two days separate, for each is equally
important to the history of our nation. I would go further and say
that having only two days of remembrance is not nearly enough for the
price paid by those we honor on each of these days.</LD>

<LD>Many thanks to Frank del Olmo for his wonderfully clean explanation
of what happened in the Reality Based Learning California contretemps
("Romer Beats Back an Ambush," Commentary, March 24). Not only Supt.
Roy Romer but many Angelenos struggle to find direct lines in the
politics surrounding every decision to be well hidden.</LD>
<LD>   As Del Olmo writes, " . . . met privately. . . ." Doesn't that
clarify the entire imbroglio? Such foolishness needs exposure.</LD>

<LD>Hollywood would surely approve of Richard Carmona and Elias Zerhouni,
whom President Bush nominated Tuesday to be surgeon general and
director of the National Institutes of Health, respectively. The two
doctors seem straight out of Central Casting.</LD>
<LD>   Carmona, 52, describes himself as "a high-school dropout, poor
Hispanic kid,'' who rose to become a Green Beret, an Arizona trauma
surgeon and a SWAT team tactician/doctor. He grabbed headlines in
1992 when he rappelled from a helicopter to rescue a person stranded
on a cliff and again in 1999 when, in a shootout at a Tucson
intersection, he killed a murderer holding a woman hostage. However,
he had a rocky time as a medical center administrator and was pushed
out as chief of a debt-plagued county health department.</LD>
<LD>   Zerhouni, 50, immigrated from Algeria to the United States at age
24 with, as Bush said, only "$300 and a dream," then went on to earn
respect as a radiologist and biomedical engineer. While Zerhouni's
radiology research is not as impressive as that of his predecessor,
Harold Varmus, the cancer researcher and Nobel Prize winner, he is
recognized as a politically savvy administrator at Johns Hopkins
University. That is a key skill for anyone who attempts to run the
gargantuan NIH, whose budget has grown from $2 billion in 1975 to
nearly $27 billion.</LD>
<TE>   If the democratic process works as it should, both Carmona and
Zerhouni will soon find themselves sitting in Senate confirmation
hearings far from Tinsel Town, offering up their professional lives
for examination.</TE>
<TE>   One objection raised so far against Carmona--that he fatally
wounded a civilian--is ridiculous, considering the defensive
circumstances and Carmona's well-reported attempt to save the man's
life after he shot him. More important might be whether he has the
temperament to focus on public health, for instance as Dr. C. Everett
Koop did on tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns raised about where Zerhouni stands on cloning and stem
cell research are to the point. At Johns Hopkins, Zerhouni played a
key role in developing such research, arguing that it should be "as
unimpeded as possible, because it may have a huge potential for all
mankind." However, the Bush administration has suggested recently
that Zerhouni would support constraints favored by the far right,
specifically a bill by Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) that would
criminalize even the cloning of a person's own cells to treat
illnesses such as Parkinson's.</TE>
<TE>   At the Senate hearings, Zerhouni and Carmona will have the
opportunity to speak for themselves. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who will chair the confirmation hearings, should hold them
as soon as possible, consistent with the time needed to check the
backgrounds of both nominees.</TE>
<TE>   The posts of surgeon general and NIH chief have long been
important, and the 9/11 crisis certainly added to their significance.
Having a new NIH head in place, for instance, might have made the
government's response to the anthrax contaminations more assured and
competent.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona and Zerhouni both appear to be appealing, brave,
up-from-nowhere nominees. But the pictures of their lives need to be
filled in.</TE>

<LD>Squeaking in under a midnight deadline Monday, the Energy Department
stopped stonewalling and released 11,000 pages of documents relating
to policy meetings. Federal judges had ordered the material handed
over after a number of organizations, including The Times, asked to
see it under the Freedom of Information Act.</LD>
<LD>   The pages offer two major revelations: that Energy buys its
Wite-Out by the gallon and that the Bush administration remains its
own worst enemy.</LD>
<LD>   The documents suggest that the Energy Department underestimated
the number of meetings that Secretary Spencer Abraham had with
industry groups. Department spokesmen had put the number at 30; it
turns out to be at least 50.</LD>
<TE>   There is nothing improper about Abraham tapping the expertise of
oil, coal, nuclear and gas interests. And, despite environmentalists'
understandable rage at being snubbed, it would have been surprising
had the documents shown that this administration, with its old school
energy leanings, had given them equal time. But a little candor early
on could have deflated critics' uneasiness, if only by bringing into
the open what most people already knew. Instead, the administration
has offered foot-dragging and Wite-Out.</TE>
<TE>   The administration can begin to repair its image--and the
democratic process--by releasing the records of Vice President Dick
Cheney's energy task force meetings. The General Accounting Office is
suing to obtain them. This time the White House shouldn't wait for a
court order; it should clear the air ahead of time.</TE>

<HD>Pragmatism Wins in Serbia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deadline and tens of millions of dollars can wonderfully
concentrate the mind, as the pragmatic rulers of Serbia are proving.
Again.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday Serbia handed over 145 ethnic Albanians it had held
since the 1998-99 war in the Serbian province of Kosovo. On Wednesday
the government agreed to clear the way for suspected war criminals to
be extradited from Serbia to the U.N. court at The Hague, where
former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is already on trial for
atrocities that his forces committed in Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia.</LD>
<LD>   It was at the end of March a year ago that Serbia arrested
Milosevic. Then as now it faced a deadline from the U.S. Congress to
act or forfeit money desperately needed in a country shattered by
war.</LD>
<TE>   Yugoslavia, now down to the provinces of Serbia and Montenegro, is
run by President Vojislav Kostunica, but Serbia is the bigger and its
prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, increasingly is at odds with
Kostunica. The Yugoslav president opposed extraditing alleged
criminals to The Hague until some vague future time when Yugoslavia
adopted a special law on such handovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Yugoslavian court formed to decide constitutional questions,
which is dominated by Serbian nationalists, also chimed in, saying
the U.N. statute establishing the war crimes tribunal could not be
applied in Serbia. Djindjic's government ignored that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Its next step should be arresting the war crimes suspects and
shipping them off to The Hague. The most prominent of the accused
believed to still be in Serbia is Ratko Mladic, the general indicted
by the U.N. tribunal for the siege of Sarajevo and a 1995 massacre of
thousands of Muslim men and boys in Srebenica. This month NATO-led
peacekeepers conducted an unsuccessful search for Mladic's boss,
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   The West was far too slow to step in and end the violence that
ravaged the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s, and it must not be
too quick to leave (a lesson that applies equally in Afghanistan).
But this week's events demonstrated the wisdom of Congress' demands
that Yugoslavia cooperate with the U.N. tribunal and that it release
the Albanian prisoners if it wanted more funds.</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic has been in power little over a year, but he has shown he
understands what must be done to help his nation recover. That has
certainly not always been the case with Yugoslav leaders.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fierce Fight in Afghan Valley Tests U.S. Soldiers and Strategy,"
March 24: Let's see if I have this right. On one side there's the
only superpower in the world facing off with the Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces consisting of a Third World, ragtag armed mob. One side has
"fast mobile ground forces using flexible tactics, sophisticated
battlefield electronics and close-in air power"; the other side has
light infantry weapons, some dating back to World War I.</LD>
<LD>   Operation Anaconda was designed to squeeze the enemies and prevent
them from escaping that local area. Golly, they stood and fought
against jet fighters, AC-130 gunships and attack helicopters for 18
hours; during that time they ambushed a convoy and pushed the
Americans out of Sher Khan Khel, a village; they then retreated to
the east to escape to fight another day.</LD>
<LD>   Our generals called it a great victory and blamed the Afghan
contingent for withdrawing and allowing the Taliban/Al Qaeda forces
to escape. What's wrong with this picture? As a former Marine, I was
on my way to Southeast Asia when we heard the news of the first fight
Americans had at Ia Drang in 1965, with the same results, and things
got worse as time passed on.</LD>

<TE>   Your article was well researched and well written. It gave readers
a good look at the infantryman in Afghanistan. I know things have
changed over the years, but as I read the article I got that "been
there and done that" feeling.</TE>
<TE>   I earned my Combat Infantry Badge during World War II and, as a
result, I really can't stand to read the stories and watch the movies
about the bravado of war. But my wife recommended that I read this
story. It really presents ground warfare from an infantryman's point
of view, pretty much as I remember it from Europe. Congratulations
for a job well done.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "U.S. Will Interview More Foreigners in Fight on Terrorism," March
21: Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's quote that Arabs and Muslims "might,
either wittingly or unwittingly, be in the same circles, communities
or social groups as those engaged in terrorist activities" is nothing
more than guilt by association. I take issue with Ashcroft, as the
Muslims in my "same circles" include doctors, lawyers, teachers,
defense engineers, members of our military, advertising executives,
entrepreneurs, even a Nobel Prize winner.</LD>
<LD>   As a patriot, I realize that I have a responsibility to do
whatever I can to help rid my country of terrorism. However,
Ashcroft's remarks only publicly humiliate our circles and, to top it
off, his tactics have done nothing but to further isolate and
alienate law-abiding Muslims at a time when law enforcement should
seek our cooperation.</LD>
<LD>   While it is grossly unfair, Muslim masses face the same dilemma as
the workers at Andersen and Enron--the whole being blamed for the
actions of a few. Unlike those companies, however, American Muslims
still have the opportunity to defend and define themselves.</LD>

<LD>"A Day Fit for a Queen and King" (March 20) addressed the very
serious issue of poverty among women in developing countries. While I
admire the king and queen of Jordan for supporting the Global
Endowment for the Poor, I was dismayed to read the third paragraph of
the story. During the event to unveil the program, King Abdullah II
"found himself commiserating with Sharon Stone over the difficulties
of getting their children into private school."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Woman Killed in Crash With CHP Car Mourned" (March 25) reported on
another senseless death caused by a high-speed police chase. This
time the innocent victim was Jessica Ann Mohorko, an 18-year-old
Hueneme High School senior who ironically was planning a career in
law enforcement only to have her life taken away when the car in
which she was a passenger was broadsided by a highway patrol car in
pursuit of a motorist for "driving erratically." Shouldn't we as
citizens be able to drive to a restaurant, as was Mohorko, without
fear that our lives will be taken from us? Is that too much to ask of
our law enforcement system?</LD>
<LD>   When will we as citizens call upon our state Legislature to repeal
the statutes that have created a virtual immunity for law enforcement
agencies when they are in pursuit of a criminal, even without
balancing all the factors that should be taken into consideration
before initiating a high-speed chase? The National Assn. of Police
Chiefs in Washington has developed an excellent set of guidelines for
officers to consider before initiating a chase. The high mortality
rate of innocent citizens in California bears witness to the fact
that these carefully developed guidelines have been put in the
police-car glove compartment, unread.</LD>

<TE>   Police chases on city streets must stop! There were three
instances of the death of innocent people in just the last couple of
weeks. Catching a thief cannot be important enough to risk the lives
of others. My own car was hit broadside by a speeding car being
chased by the police 19 years ago, and my passenger was killed
instantly.</TE>
<TE>   I am still outraged at the loss and the senselessness of this
horrible occurrence. Shortly after, I read that the police reported

<LD>Regarding the upcoming increase in postage (yet again) and the U.S.
Postal Service's continuing debt ("Stamp Price to Rise, but Post
Office Still Sinking," March 23), my high school history teacher had
the answer more than 20 years ago. How about soliciting corporate
sponsorship for postage stamps?</LD>
<LD>   Let Toyota or Heinz or Kellogg design and pay for the stamp. The
consumer can pay a small percentage of the cost, while the corporate
sponsor can pay the bulk of it and use the stamp for advertising. I
would suffer Tony the Tiger on my stamp for a 10-cent rate. And as
for the philatelists out there, we can have "vanity stamps" that can
be purchased at the full price, so that we still have the option of
purchasing the more aesthetic stamps (though I am sure Toyota,
Listerine or whoever could come up with some snazzy designs).</LD>

<LD>If The Times is going to write about the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, please don't waste precious manpower and newsprint on
another puff piece like "California Operations Put a Face on Minority
Gains at DEA" (March 23).</LD>
<LD>   There are many pressing issues to write about; e.g., the DEA's
ungodly $19.2-billion budget and its ideology-inspired crusade
against medical marijuana. And besides, we already know why the DEA
is hiring minorities: It makes it easier to bust minorities and
continue filling our prisons with nonviolent drug offenders.</LD>

<HD>Thomas Kelly, 72; Head of NASA's Lunar Module Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Kelly, director of the engineering team that designed and
built the lunar module that ferried astronauts Neil Armstrong and
Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr. to and from the lunar surface during their
historic 1969 flight to the moon, has died.</LD>
<LD>   He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, dubbed "the father of the lunar module" by NASA, died
Saturday of pulmonary fibrosis at his home in Cutchogue, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   On July 20, 1969, the lunar module carrying Armstrong and Aldrin
touched down on the powdery surface of the moon. "Houston,
Tranquillity Base here," Armstrong radioed. "The Eagle has landed."</TE>
<TE>   In the Spacecraft Analysis Room next to Mission Control at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Center in Houston,
Kelly had been troubleshooting problems throughout the flight.</TE>
<TE>   But his thrill at the lunar module's successful landing quickly
turned to concern as control monitors signaled a significant problem:
Ice had formed in a fuel line and become stuck; residual heat from
the engine was moving up toward the frozen fuel.</TE>
<TE>   If the fuel got hot enough, it could detonate.</TE>
<TE>   "We were on the verge of taking action when the problem corrected
itself," Kelly said. "So after that I was able to relax and say,
'Wow, we did it!'"</TE>
<TE>   For Kelly, "we" meant the 3,000 engineers and 4,000 technicians
and mechanics at Grumman Aerospace Corp. in Bethpage, N.Y., who spent
seven years designing and building the lunar module under Kelly's
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Kelly was a major force in our nation's space race," said
Joshua Stoff, curator of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden
City, N.Y., home to one of three remaining lunar modules.</TE>
<TE>   "He designed one of the most historic vehicles ever built," Stoff
said Monday. "It's the only vehicle that ever took human beings from
one world to another, and nothing else before or since has ever been
like [it]."</TE>
<TE>   Resembling a bizarre insect, the lunar module had four spindly
legs and a lumpy body.</TE>
<TE>   It was covered with a thin skin of gold-aluminized Mylar. It
weighed 12,000 pounds empty and about 30,000 pounds with fuel. And it
measured 29 feet across from footpad to footpad and was about as
tall.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it was only working in space it didn't need to have any
aerodynamic qualities whatsoever, so its shape and form are perfectly
functional," Stoff said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's a very oddly shaped vehicle with things sticking
out all over it: legs and antennas, fuel tanks--all sorts of things."</TE>
<TE>   Stoff said Kelly was instrumental in conceiving the idea that only
part of the spacecraft that blasted off from Earth would make the
final step of the journey back from the moon's surface.</TE>
<TE>   The lunar module consisted of two stages: When lifting off from
the moon, the bottom half served as the launch pad and the astronauts
rode the top half back to the orbiting command module.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen lunar modules were built, carrying Apollo astronauts from
their command module to the moon's surface six times between 1969 and
1972.</TE>
<TE>   Stoff, who became friends with Kelly after interviewing him for
Stoff's 1985 book on the lunar module program, "Chariots for Apollo,"
described Kelly as "a small man and very much an engineer in the way
he talked--straightforward and very quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brooklyn and raised in Merrick on Long Island, Kelly
became fascinated with engineering in high school.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated as valedictorian with a four-year Grumman engineering
scholarship to study at Cornell University and work summers at
Grumman.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Cornell in 1951 with a degree in
mathematical engineering and an ROTC commission in the Air Force
Reserve, Kelly joined Grumman full time.</TE>
<TE>   He worked on advanced missile and aircraft programs until he was
called to active duty in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the Russians launched Sputnik, the first satellite.
"At that moment," Kelly once said, "I became interested in space."</TE>
<TE>   After being discharged from the Air Force in 1958, he worked
briefly for Lockheed before Grumman lured him back to Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me that they were going to set up a design group to
look for business in space, and they wanted me to help them," he told
the New York Times in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time, we were only in a 'what if' stage, and I was one of
only two men working on a lunar project to explore the technical
issues of getting to the moon."</TE>
<TE>   The space race heated up even more in 1961, when the Soviet Union
put the first man into orbit and President Kennedy declared that the
nation should commit itself to "landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to Earth" by the end of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "He picked the most ambitious project possible," Kelly said. "His
commitment changed the ballgame for everyone in the industry, and
companies began to jockey for position to compete in building
spacecraft."</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, Grumman won a $2-billion government contract to build the
lunar module.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, the lunar project dominated Kelly's life.
Twelve-hour days were typical.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody at Grumman who worked on the [lunar module] will ever
forget it," Kelly said in 1998. "From the sweeper to the chief
engineer, we all knew we were part of a majestic venture. We were
making history."</TE>
<TE>   After he retired, Kelly wrote a book about his Apollo experiences,
"Moon Lander: How We Developed the Apollo Lunar Module," published
last year by Smithsonian Institution Press.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is survived by his wife Joan; six children and 10
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Patricia Reif, 72; Ex-Nun Founded Studies in Feminist
Spirituality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patricia Reif, an activist, former nun and pioneering educator who
founded the master's program in feminist spirituality at Immaculate
Heart College Center, died of pancreatic cancer Sunday at her home in
Claremont. She was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Reif, who taught philosophy and theology, also played an integral
role in the historic discussions in 1970 that led a majority of nuns
in the order of Immaculate Heart of Mary to renounce their vows and
establish an experimental lay community.</LD>
<LD>   In the tumult over modernization of the Roman Catholic Church in
the late 1960s, the sisters of Immaculate Heart of Mary abandoned
their habits, gave up scheduled prayers and took up a broad agenda of
public service. After the Vatican ordered the nuns to abandon most of
their reforms, about 300 left to form a lay community and became the
only Catholic order of nuns to renounce their vows.</LD>
<TE>   "Pat Reif was one of the visionaries," said Susan Maloney, a
visiting scholar in women's studies at Cal State Northridge. "She was
at the forefront of writing the philosophical foundation of the new
community."</TE>
<TE>   Known for her invigorating intellect and commitment to social
justice, Reif founded the nation's first graduate degree program in
feminist spirituality in 1984. It attracted several hundred women,
who were leaders in their fields and from a diverse range of faith
traditions, to courses that examined the Bible, women's experiences
and religious thinking from a feminist perspective. Lecturers
included the country's leading women theologians, including Rosemary
Radford Reuther and Mary Hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "It made a lasting impact on the field," said Hunt, founder of
Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual. "I dare say the
professors learned a great deal from Pat, too, about adult education
models and respectful co-learning."</TE>
<TE>   Reif had spent much of the 1960s and '70s demonstrating in the
antinuclear movement. In the mid-1970s she focused on the problem of
hunger and helped found the Interfaith Hunger Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   After she finished her work with the hunger group in the early
1980s, she began to read feminist theology and became so excited
about it that she wanted to share the discovery with others.</TE>
<TE>   She believed, and others at Immaculate Heart College Center in Los
Angeles agreed, that it fit perfectly into the center's liberal
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexism certainly is a justice issue," Reif said in 1984. "Sexism
is a sin."</TE>
<TE>   The program eventually included courses not only in theology and
ethics but on female poets and other topics related to women's
experiences. One year the classes ranged from "Christology: Can a
Male Savior Save Women?" to "The Apocalyptic Vision of Flannery
O'Connor."</TE>
<TE>   Community engagement was a requirement, forcing students out of
the classroom into projects that benefited others. One student, for
example, went on to run a model program that helps women leave
prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very important to Pat to combine [academic study] with
acting as a social change agent," said Maloney, who succeeded Reif as
head of the program. "She did that in her own life. It was not by any
means just theoretical."</TE>
<TE>   The courses were offered for 16 years until financial difficulties
led the college center to close the program two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reif's work for the hunger coalition included helping to develop
campaigns against the promotion of infant formula over breastfeeding
in Third World countries. She also helped shape a publication, now in
its 25th year, called "The People's Guide to Welfare, Health and
Other Services," which is printed in 10 languages and distributed
throughout Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "One thinks of a philosopher as being more esoteric and less
involved with mailing lists and rallies and leaflets," said the Rev.
Gene Boutilier, who was executive director of the Southern California
Ecumenical Council when it launched the hunger project. "Pat was an
interesting combination of the very practical and the philosophical.
Her deep social-justice orientation had to do with fixing things
step, by step, by step."</TE>
<TE>   Reif's down-to-earth practicality showed even as she neared death,
Boutilier said. She had written a checklist of tasks to be done
before she died. One job was to contact a local airline to arrange
for her frequent flier miles to be transferred to a sister who could
use them to fly across the country to her funeral. "She called the
airline and said 'I'm dying and I would like to do this.' It
absolutely freaked out the person on the other end of the phone,"
Boutilier said. "Pat wasn't looking for sympathy; she was just trying
to check off an item of business. She got it done."</TE>
<TE>   The longtime activist also was a founding member of the Southern
California Interfaith Task Force on Central America. She served on
the board of Uncommon Ground, a project of the Inner-City Law Center,
and was as an early head of the Women's Ordination Conference, which
sought to bring recognition of the priestly role of women in the
Roman Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles native, she earned her bachelor's degree from
Immaculate Heart in 1953 and a doctorate in philosophy from St. Louis
University in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   She retired in 1993 and moved to Pilgrim Place, a retirement
community in Claremont. True to her commitment to ecumenism, she was
one of the first Catholics to join Pilgrim Place Residence in
Claremont, founded more than 80 years ago as a retirement home for
former Christian workers, most of them Protestants.</TE>
<TE>   Reif is survived by sisters Marian Pullara of Colorado Springs,
Colo., Jean Robinson of Knoxville, Tenn., and Carol Resco of
Portland, Ore.; a brother, David, of Tulsa, Okla., and several nieces
and nephews.</TE>
<TE>   Two services will be held on April 6. The first is scheduled for
10 a.m. at Mother of Good Counsel Catholic Church in Los Angeles. The
second service will be held at 4 p.m. at Pilgrim Place Residence in
Claremont.</TE>

<HD>Dudley Moore, 66; Comic Actor, Musician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS and SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dudley Moore, the elfin, Oxford-educated comic actor who used biting
wit, physical pratfalls and on-screen vulnerability to tap into the
good-natured debauchery of the times in hit films such as "10" and
"Arthur," died Wednesday at his home in Plainfield, N.J., after a
long, debilitating illness. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-foot, 21/2-inch, British-born funny man died of pneumonia as
a complication of progressive supranuclear palsy, according to his
publicist in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Moore had been diagnosed with the degenerative, Parkinson's-like
disease in 1997. The rare brain disorder causes severe problems with
walking and balance, and is triggered by the death of cells in a
small area of the brain stem. Although the disease is not fatal,
sufferers such as Moore are predisposed to develop illnesses such as
pneumonia.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, Moore, a composer and accomplished pianist who
early in his career found fame on stage by teaming with the late
Peter Cook for a comedy revue called "Beyond the Fringe," had trouble
communicating.</TE>
<TE>   His last public appearance was in November at London's Buckingham
Palace as Queen Elizabeth conferred upon him one of the United
Kingdom's highest honors for entertainment, the insignia of Commander
of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.</TE>
<TE>   But while his mind was ever alert, Moore's body had been robbed of
its vitality.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a very debilitating disease," said his friend Tony Bill,
who had directed the actor in one of his rare dramas, "Six Weeks,"
and the comedy "Crazy People." Bill said Moore's "mental powers had
not been affected," but he was forced to watch himself "wasting
away."</TE>
<TE>   "That was the tough thing," said Lou Pitt, Moore's agent of more
than 25 years. "He could receive all the information ... but couldn't
express it."</TE>
<TE>   Divorced four times, Moore had been living with his friends
pianist Rena Fruchter and her husband, Brian Dallow.</TE>
<TE>   During his heyday in the early 1980s, Moore commanded $2 million a
picture, an impressive fee in those days. But by 1999, he was forced
to sell his beloved house in Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   With his shaggy mane, sly grin and even a pixieish twinkle in his
eyes, Moore became an unlikely movie sex symbol.</TE>
<TE>   "He was physically funny and adorable and kind of sexy," said Rita
Rudner, who co-wrote and starred with Moore in his last movie,
"Weekend in the Country" in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   It was Blake Edwards who turned Moore into a comic giant by
casting him in the hit 1979 film "10." Moore played a successful
composer suffering a midlife crisis who, driving through Beverly
Hills one day, spots a perfect vision of beauty on her way to her
wedding. He then follows the blond-braided beauty played by Bo Derek
to Mexico on her honeymoon.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Derek said, "He was wonderful to work with, and when
he wasn't making you laugh with his comedy, he was making you cry
with his music," she said. The last time she saw him was at a tribute
concert to him last April at Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued by Edwards and his wife and Moore's "10"
co-star Julie Andrews, they expressed sadness over the passing of the
comedian, who they described as a "rare human being who brought
warmth and joy to all who knew him."</TE>
<TE>   Two years after he found international stardom in "10," Moore
received his first and only Oscar nomination for best actor in the
blockbuster comedy "Arthur." He played a rich, lovable lush opposite
Liza Minnelli's stable but poor Italian waitress and Sir John Gielgud
in his Oscar-winning role for best supporting actor as his faithful
manservant.</TE>
<TE>   Minnelli said in a statement Wednesday that she was deeply
saddened by her co-star's death. "He was a unique individual who was
multitalented," she said. "He could make the world laugh and brought
joy to millions."</TE>
<TE>   But Moore was unable to sustain his box office appeal because of a
series of misfires, including "Unfaithfully Yours" and "Blame it on
the Bellboy." And in the early 1990s, he made two unsuccessful
attempts at his own TV series, with "Dudley" in 1993 and "Daddy's
Girl" in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his film and TV work, however, he never abandoned his
musical career, performing as a guest artist with several symphonies,
including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and developing and co-hosting
with conductor Sir Georg Solti the Showtime series "Orchestra!" He
even issued a CD of his music titled "Dudley Moore--Live from an
Airplane Hangar" in 2000 to raise money for research on his
debilitating disease.</TE>
<TE>   Dudley Stuart John Moore was born April 19, 1935, in less than
affluence in Dagenham, Essex, England, to a railway engineer father
and a Christian Scientist typist mother. Born with a club foot and
withered right leg, Moore eventually underwent a series of corrective
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt said he doubted Moore ever got over his childhood feelings of
inadequacy over his early physical woes, saying they lingered with
him like an "albatross" that he kept private for years.</TE>
<TE>   Music freed him, however. At the age of 6, Moore began studying
piano and later the violin, harpsichord and organ. After graduating
from Dagaenham County High School, he attended Guidhall School of
Music and Drama in London and then vaulted over his lowly station by
gaining entrance to Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in
Oxford, England, on an organ scholarship. By the time he left in
1958, he was a composer for local cabarets.</TE>
<TE>   He also was an excellent jazz pianist and recorded an album with
the great jazz singer Cleo Laine. In his later years, Moore performed
at the Hollywood Bowl, appearing in groups with top jazz players such
as bassist Ray Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Fame came in 1961, when Moore teamed on the London stage with
three other Oxford graduates--Cook, Jonathan Miller and Alan
Bennett--in the antic but sophisticated musical and comedy revue
"Beyond the Fringe."</TE>
<TE>   The show was an instant hit, playing for four years, first in
London and then on Broadway. Afterward, Moore and Cook became a
popular team doing a TV series and five movies, including their
outrageous 1967 spin on the Faust legend, "Bedazzled," which featured
Raquel Welch as Lust (and remade in 2000 with Brendan Fraser and
Elizabeth Hurley).</TE>
<TE>   They returned to the Broadway stage in the mid-'70s with their
award-winning comedy revue "Good Evening," which featured the famous
sketch about an eatery that only served frogs and peaches.</TE>
<TE>   Moore recalled his relationship with Cook as "stormy."</TE>
<TE>   "We always got along well together when we were alone, but
sometimes when other people were around, there was competition,"
Moore said in a 1983 interview. "He was bored with my desire to
please, and I scorned his relentless and perverse cynicism."</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, they parted company and Moore headed west to Hollywood to
star in the Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase comedy "Foul Play," in which he
played a randy opera conductor.</TE>
<TE>   Moore's private life was a turbulent series of broken
relationships and marriages. His former wives included British
actress and model Suzy Kendall, American film star Tuesday Weld,
Brogan Lane and Nicole Rothschild.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Moore was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse after
Rothschild claimed that he struck her. He was investigated but
charges were never lodged and they married a month later. They
separated in May 1986, reconciled briefly, then in 1997 separated
again and eventually divorced.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Moore began to suffer severe memory lapses and
was fired from Barbra Streisand's film "The Mirror Has Two Faces."</TE>
<TE>   In his last film, "Weekend in the Country," Rudner said she knew
there was something terribly wrong with Moore. "He had problems
remembering things and we used to go through scenes over and over."</TE>
<TE>   On a concert tour of Australia in 1996, Moore was criticized in
the media for appearing drunk, staggering and speaking incoherently.
The next year, he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic for neurological
tests, but while there the doctors found a hole in his heart that
required surgery. The doctors then diagnosed him with PSP.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally mysterious the way this illness attacks and eats you
up and spits you out," Moore said in a December 2000 interview. "I
did get angry, but there's not much point in being angry. There's
always a feeling, 'Why did it hit me?' And I can't make peace with it
because I know I'm going to die from it."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Hiller, who directed Moore in the 1983 film "Romantic
Comedy," recalled the last time he saw his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a year or two ago that he came out here [to L.A.] to close
things up, and Lou Pitt, his agent, had a Sunday afternoon
get-together," Hiller said. "There were about 40 or 50 of us and we
were just saying hi and goodbye. We were happy to see him, but it was
so sad to see this warm and talented ... person having difficulty
even communicating."</TE>
<TE>   Moore is survived by two sons, Patrick, by Weld, and Nicholas, by
Rothschild; and his sister, Barbara Stevens. Funeral and memorial
services were pending.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in Moore's memory can be made to Music for All Seasons
and the Dudley Moore Research Fund for PSP.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Must Prove Intent in Case Against Company</HD>
<DH>Court: Executive meetings preceding Enron-related shredding
are key in proving obstruction of justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Oct. 23, senior executives in Andersen's Houston offices that
handled the firm's audit of a faltering client, Enron Corp., attended
a meeting, one of a series they would hold that day. The topics of
discussion, according to a typed agenda, included "SEC
probe/shareholder lawsuits" and "soft and hard copy file review."</LD>
<LD>   The day before, Enron had disclosed a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry involving its off-the-books partnerships. The Oct.
23 meetings in Houston were followed by three days of document
shredding, in which Andersen staffers destroyed at least 26 trunks
and 24 additional boxes filled with records related to Enron--leading
to a Justice Department indictment of Andersen on an obstruction of
justice charge.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the fate of the 89-year-old accounting giant turns largely on
what Andersen executives were thinking Oct. 23, as a conviction could
force the company out of business.  The intent of these executives,
particularly former partner David Duncan, is expected to become the
fulcrum of the legal battle unfolding between Andersen and federal
prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen disclosed in January that company employees "disposed of
a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper
documents and correspondence" related to Enron. Four days later it
announced the firing of Duncan and the suspension of three other
partners in Houston in connection with the shredding.</TE>
<TE>   But destroying the Enron-related papers isn't necessarily a crime.
Instead, the key to proving a violation of the obstruction law,
legal experts said, is showing that a defendant "corruptly persuaded"
others to act.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the senior executives told employees that the shredding
was needed to comply with legitimate company policy, Andersen could
be convicted if prosecutors show the executives' real intention was
to keep records away from an official investigation, experts said.
But there are varying legal definitions of "corrupt," potentially
giving a jury great leeway in determining the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The loose legal standards mean prosecutors could vastly improve
their case by finding an Andersen executive who is willing to testify
about their intentions, perhaps under an immunity agreement. Duncan,
the lead partner on the Enron account, met with prosecutors last
week, but it is unclear if such a deal will emerge. Prosecutors also
may seek deals with other executives familiar with Andersen's October
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Under law, the firm may be held liable for the actions of its
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Justice Department unsealed its indictment March 14,
Andersen has toned down its condemnation of Duncan. In announcing
Duncan's dismissal in January, Andersen said "it should be perfectly
clear that Andersen will not tolerate unethical behavior, gross
errors in judgment or willful violation of our policies."</TE>
<TE>   But lately, Andersen lawyers have been saying that Duncan merely
made a mistake amid confusion over what the firm now describes as its
flawed document-retention policy, and that he didn't break any laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Duncan did what he thought was right," said Rusty Hardin,
a lawyer for Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Andersen is expected to argue that in a rush to comply
with the firm's policy--which essentially called for destroying any
drafts, notes, e-mail or other documents not needed to back up an
auditor's conclusions--Andersen executives violated it.</TE>
<TE>   In an internal report, Andersen criticized the policy for its
"lack of clarity," according to excerpts the company released.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the Justice Department obtains witness testimony from
Andersen officials, the accounting firm may be able to draw out
evidence to show there were many competing motives behind the
shredding.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time you get to trial, 98% of the who, what and where is
known to both sides and the whole fight is over the why," said Peter
Romatowski, a defense lawyer in Washington and a former federal
prosecutor. "There's going to be room to argue both sides of that,
even if there are witnesses who tell it the government's way."</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors are unable to persuade any Andersen executives to
testify, they probably will try to prove their case by using other
evidence in a bid to shed light on their intent. A huge quantity of
internal documents and correspondence about the shredding effort has
been turned over to federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's report said that by the time of the Oct. 23 meetings,
Duncan and other partners handling the Enron account knew that the
Securities and Exchange Commission had made an informal request to
Enron for information related to partnerships headed by its former
chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan and another partner, Debra Cash, had met with Enron
executives the day before and learned that Enron was expecting a
second SEC letter asking for accounting-related information and that
Enron had hired a new law firm to examine the Fastow partnerships,
according to the Andersen report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said one person's notes from an Oct. 23 meeting
include the directive "clean up--documentation" followed by "SEC
voluntary request/two suits filed, more on way." But the report said
staffers who cleaned up their files after the Oct. 23 meetings
"apparently did so openly, with no sense that they were doing
anything wrong or illegal."</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 9 e-mail, Duncan's assistant told others to stop
shredding because the firm had received an SEC subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   But Hardin said, "If you've got a conspiracy to destroy documents,
why do you send an in-the-open e-mail Nov. 9, saying 'Stop it'?"</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also are expected to prove intent by contending that
the document destruction far exceeded typical levels. Andersen
acknowledged in its report that "the timing and scale of the
destruction activity that occurred do not appear to have been
normal," but said the records were "non-work papers" that routinely
would have been purged.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's internal report said communications between the Houston
office and Andersen officials in Oregon and London resulted in
additional document destruction in those offices, but that the
shredding in Chicago "does not appear to have been coordinated" with
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors are expected to emphasize the scale of document
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecution effort will always be to show something greater
than the bare minimum," Romatowski said. "The defense will be
attempting to minimize the scope of the activity horizontally and
vertically. The question for the jury will be to find the degree of
the activity. You can't X-ray people's heads to find out their
intent."</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Hit by Off-Sheet Debt Report</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Cable firm's stock falls 18% on the $2.3-billion
disclosure. The company also posts a sizable loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. took investors by surprise Wednesday
when the nation's sixth-largest cable operator acknowledged that it
has $2.3 billion in debt not included on its balance sheet.</LD>
<LD>   The company also reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter
loss as a result of a $1.5-billion write-down on the value of a
former telephone venture, Adelphia Business Solutions, which filed
for bankruptcy protection Wednesday. Adelphia spun off its 79% stake
in the phone venture to the public in January to reduce the debt of
its cable company by $1.7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Investors drove down Adelphia shares Wednesday by $3.69, or 18%,
to $16.70 in Nasdaq trading. Wall Street has been wary of any company
using off-balance-sheet financing practices after the December
bankruptcy filing of Enron Corp., which used private partnerships to
shift debt off its books.</LD>
<TE>   In the case of Adelphia, the controlling Rigas family has been
borrowing money through a privately held partnership it controls. The
family in effect shifted debt from Adelphia Communications to the
off-balance-sheet partnership, called Highland Holdings, whose loans
were guaranteed by the public company.</TE>
<TE>   Though analysts say the practice is not illegal, investors say it
is inappropriate and undermines the company's credibility on Wall
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it may cut Adelphia's BB- credit
rating if the company does not have sufficient assets to support a
higher debt level. "We have to evaluate the situation," said Richard
Siderman, an analyst at the credit-rating firm.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the disclosure Wednesday, Adelphia was among the most
leveraged of the major cable companies, with debt of $14.7 billion.
As part of an industrywide consolidation, Adelphia bought several
cable rivals in recent years, including Century Communications Corp.,
the leading cable operator in the city of Los Angeles, where the
Rigas family now serves more than 500,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Adelphia, like other cable companies, has invested
heavily over the last five years to upgrade its facilities with
digital technologies, enabling it to sell Internet access and
interactive TV services.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its reliance on debt, Adelphia financially has had
close calls throughout its 40-year history. The company has a
reputation on Wall Street for using complex financial instruments
that have made its structure difficult to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, which is based in Coudersport, Pa., said the $2.3
billion in debt is part of a "co-borrowing" arrangement with
affiliates. In a conference call with investors Wednesday, Adelphia
Chief Financial Officer Timothy Rigas said there are substantial
assets to back up the debt in those affiliated companies, which are
controlled by the Rigas family, but he would not be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas indicated through a company official late Wednesday that the
off-balance-sheet financing was previously and appropriately
disclosed to investors. Yet many investors said they heard about the
off-balance-sheet debt for the first time Wednesday, when Rigas
mentioned it in the earnings call.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors worry that the assets in these private ventures may
not be enough to cover the debt.</TE>
<TE>   "The value may well fall short of the debt, which means their
overall credit rating could be affected," analyst Siderman said.</TE>
<TE>   One investor with knowledge of the family-controlled Highland
Holdings, said the partnership holds 60 million Adelphia shares and
owns cable systems that service 300,000 customers. At current market
prices, the cable systems could be worth $1 billion or more. At
Wednesday's closing price, the 60 million Adelphia shares are worth
$1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The investor said the company may be forced to sell the cable
systems in the partnerships to cover the debt. The most valuable of
those systems serve about 50,000 subscribers in San Diego, according
to one investor.</TE>
<TE>   In the conference call Wednesday, Rigas would not say how much
money Adelphia would lose because of the bankruptcy filing of its
phone venture.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia was more aggressive than any other cable company its size
in pursuing the phone business. Despite a wary Wall Street, the
company, through a separate, publicly traded entity, invested
billions of dollars building a fiber-optic network across the country
to handle telephone and high-speed Internet traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But the glut of "bandwidth" that contributed to the collapse of
companies such as Global Crossing also hurt Adelphia's phone venture.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications said its net loss for the fourth quarter
quadrupled to $1.3 billion, or $6.95 a share, from a net loss of $255
million, or $1.73, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue increased to $950 million from $804.6 million in the

<HD>Andersen Auditors OK Volcker Plan</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Anticipating layoffs, firm's partners scramble
to make deals and name a new CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of Andersen's U.S. auditing practice have told former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker that they will accept his
restructuring plan, potentially a key step in Andersen's scramble to
keep at least some portion of the firm intact, sources said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But with the company's troubles mounting, Andersen is expected to
announce layoffs as early as next week, a source said.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Andersen is in advancing talks to sell its U.S. tax
practice to another Big Five accounting firm, with Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu appearing to be the most likely buyer, according to a source
close to the matter.</LD>
<TE>   In an ambitious reform plan unveiled Friday, Volcker proposed
revamping Andersen by, among other things, splitting its auditing and
consulting businesses and overhauling its top management. But the
former Fed chairman said his proposal depended on the consent of
Andersen partners and an agreement by the Justice Department to
dismiss or suspend its prosecution of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Andersen labeled the proposal "positive and
constructive," but Volcker and others have asked for a more
definitive response. In recent days, Volcker, who was appointed last
month to head a special Andersen oversight board, indicated that he
would abandon the plan if partners did not embrace his idea.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker could not be reached for comment Wednesday, and Andersen
spokesman Charlie Leonard would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said they did not have details on layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "No final decisions on reductions in U.S. personnel have been
made. Given the decision by the Justice Department to indict the
entire 28,000-person firm, it is inevitable that some reductions in
work force will have to be made in the coming months," the company
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   All U.S. partners are scheduled to participate in a lengthy
teleconference today to help chart the firm's immediate future</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, top audit partners plan to meet to officially
affirm their support, and to begin implementing Volcker's proposed
changes, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker wants the Justice Department to dismiss or suspend
criminal prosecution on an obstruction of justice charge for
Andersen's shredding of documents related to its work for Enron Corp.
Andersen has acknowledged destroying documents after Enron disclosed
that the Securities and Exchange Commission was examining its
off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen denies criminal wrongdoing and is scheduled to go to
trial May 6 in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that some experts interpreted as an initial sign of
acquiescence toward Volcker's plan, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph
F. Berardino resigned Tuesday. Andersen's 18-member board of partners
will meet Tuesday in London to consider a possible successor, Leonard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's proposal has stirred considerable controversy within
Andersen, with different sets of partners adopting widely divergent
stances depending on how it affects them, sources have said.</TE>
<TE>   Some audit partners have latched on to the plan as the best way to
salvage the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan is a great idea," said John Oliver, an audit partner at
Andersen's Vienna, Va., office. "It would be the best opportunity to
retain jobs at Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   However, many tax and consulting partners oppose Volcker's
proposal, saying it could cripple their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make any sense. It puts me out of my job and my
career," said a tax partner who specializes in international tax
work. If the tax group were broken off into an independent unit, as
the Volcker plan seems to envision, it would be deprived of access to
foreign offices, thus preventing global tax experts from doing their
job, the partner said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 60 major clients since December.</TE>

<HD>TV Movie in Planning on Watkins' Enron Saga</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film and television studio Artisan Entertainment Inc. said it bought
rights to the life story of Enron Corp. Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins and the upcoming book "Power Failure" to turn into a
television movie.</LD>
<LD>   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Artisan is best known for releasing the hit independent film "The
Blair Witch Project" in 1999. Its recently formed Artisan Television
wing is a supplier of made-for-TV movies.</LD>
<TE>   Since Enron's bankruptcy filing in December, Hollywood has been
scrambling to develop TV movies based on its accounting scandals and
downward spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Artisan recently hired former "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman
as a consultant for an Enron TV movie it is developing with FX cable
TV channel.</TE>
<TE>   At "60 Minutes," Bergman was instrumental in gaining national
exposure for tobacco company whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand. Bergman's
and Wigand's story formed the center of 1999's Oscar-nominated movie
"The Insider."</TE>
<TE>   The book about Watkins, written by journalist Mimi Swartz, was
sold recently to Doubleday for $500,000. It examines the Enron crisis
through the eyes of its leading female executive, who found herself
at odds with the company's male-dominated upper echelon.</TE>

<HD>Produce Industry Balks at Food Security Guidelines</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Firms say FDA proposals to protect against
bioterrorism are ineffective and costly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the rush to adopt new protections against bioterrorism, at least
one part of the food industry is trying to put on the brakes.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh-produce shippers have in recent weeks lobbied the Food and
Drug Administration to specifically exclude them from its new
guidelines urging tamper-resistant packaging and other security
measures. The produce industry fears burdensome regulation if
Congress adopts these guidelines as part of food security legislation
later this year.</LD>
<LD>   The preemptive strike illustrates a behind-the-scenes battle over
food security regulations that many in the industry believe are
unnecessary, ineffective and costly, ultimately driving up prices for
consumers.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not because we don't care about food security," said Kathy
Means, a vice president of the Produce Marketing Assn. "Companies
marketing fresh produce are acutely aware of the need to protect the
food supply, and many have already taken appropriate measures."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's guidelines are now the only road map for the
$1.3-trillion food chain to protect against bioterrorism. The
Department of Agriculture still is working on its own guidelines,
Neither is imposing mandatory restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's advisory deals with everything from screening employees
and suppliers to conducting recalls. The agency also is considering
urging tamper-resistant packaging on all items, including fruits and
vegetables in the produce aisle, a move that prompted objections.</TE>
<TE>   The Produce Marketing Assn. says requiring tamper-resistant wrap
or boxes would be devastating for fruit and vegetable shippers. It
wouldn't allow produce to "breathe" and would raise temperatures and
encourage rot, costing millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd dramatically drive up the cost of fruits and vegetables
doing that," said Tim Shaheen, chief executive of Bakersfield-based
Sun World International, a large fruit marketer. "You have to weigh
the benefits and risks of doing something like this."</TE>
<TE>   Produce, he said, still could be tampered with in the field, with
contaminants sealed into packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Produce groups also are opposing measures urging bar-code stickers
or other means of tracing individual pieces of produce to the field
where they were grown.</TE>
<TE>   Such a system doesn't exist now and would be expensive and
difficult to develop and administrate, Means said. And ultimately,
industry officials say, if a sick consumer disposes of the sticker
before eating the fruit, it would be useless as a tool in containing
illness.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA released its food security guidelines for manufacturers,
suppliers and retailers in January. The guidelines were developed in
cooperation with the food industry--mostly the packaged food segment.
According to one FDA official, the guidelines are just a laundry
list, not necessarily "applicable to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   However, because the guidelines could be used by Congress in
drafting food security regulations, all sectors of the food industry
have weighed in to protect their own economic interests.</TE>
<TE>   Most food safety advocates say the guidelines do not effectively
protect consumers from intentional tampering.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA's guidelines are a very weak shield against the risk of
bioterrorism," said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group. "Whether or not
consumers are protected is up to the people supplying the food."</TE>
<TE>   And though more producers and manufacturers have a heightened
sense of concern, there is no hard evidence that the guidelines are
being adopted by companies of all sizes, Smith DeWaal says.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely in its history has the food industry had to grapple with
security issues. Analysts say food firms and trade groups have
struggled since Sept. 11 to come up with universal guidelines to help
protect consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Farm interests have faced a more difficult challenge than their
food-processing counterparts. How do you protect miles of open farm
land, dairy pastures and ranches and open produce bins in supermarket
aisles?</TE>
<TE>   There are many different issues for each food sector, from plants
to animals, said Linda Harris, a professor of food science at UC
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Until better methods of securing cropland and protecting produce
can be developed, monitoring is better left up to the agriculture
industry, Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-regulation or monitoring is as effective or more effective
than having the government mandate something that is equally vague,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Great strides, she said, have been made in the last five years in
the industry's ability to trace boxes of produce back to producers
and individual lots taken off farms. And more can be done to speed
the process.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the FDA's guidelines were derived from precautions that
large processed-food companies already were taking to protect
themselves and their very visible brand names, said Peter Cleary of
the Grocery Manufacturers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, firms also have begun exploring the security of their
packaging, he said, determining whether they need to make it easier
for consumers to tell if packaging has been tampered with, much as
over-the-counter drug companies did in the 1980s after containers of
Tylenol were laced with cyanide.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarkets say they are doing their part to prevent bioterrorism
by conducting additional food security training, restricting access
in loading areas and, in some cases, even closing vulnerable areas
such as open salad bars.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, food safety experts say, there are no regimens in place that
could give consumers an absolute assurance of safety.</TE>
<TE>   And all of this additional security could come with a higher price
tag for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't put fences around everything," Sun World's Shaheen
said. "That would just double the cost and not necessarily solve the
problem."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>News Corp. acknowledged Wednesday that it will take a noncash charge
of about $2billion against third-quarter earnings on its investment
in Gemstar-TV Guide International.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar last week took a $5 billion write-off because of new
accounting rules governing goodwill, which is the difference between
the price paid for an asset and the current value. News Corp.
officials said the $2-billion write-off corresponds with the
company's 42.6% ownership stake in Gemstar, which publishes print and
electronic television guides.</LD>

<HD>Stock Mutual Funds Again Are Gaining Favor</HD>
<DH>Investing: Strong cash inflows this month follow drop in
February. Bond fund purchases may be waning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors appear to have regained their appetite for stock mutual
funds this month, after a lull in February.</LD>
<LD>   Major fund companies said their stock funds have seen strong cash
inflows this month as economic signals have increasingly pointed to
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, purchases of bond funds may be waning as interest rates
rise, depressing the value of bond fund shares.</LD>
<TE>   Industrywide data for February, reported Wednesday by the
Investment Company Institute, showed stock funds' net cash inflow
totaled $4.7 billion in the month, down sharply from $20billion in
January.</TE>
<TE>   But demand has revived. Vanguard Group said purchases of its stock
funds this month reached the highest level in almost three years. The
firm expects net cash flow of $3.8 billion into its stock funds this
month, the strongest since April 1999, spokesman John Demming said.</TE>
<TE>   Net cash inflow measures new fund purchases minus redemptions and
exchanges. Fund flows are watched as a key indicator of small
investors' interest in the markets.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Investments, the largest U.S. mutual fund company, is
seeing "very strong" purchases of equity funds this month, ahead of
January's pace that brought in $2.5 billion of new money, spokeswoman
Anne Crowley said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are following the trend of the stock market: After
rallying early in January, stocks slumped in February, then resurged
early this month.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for bond funds also is following market trends.
High-quality bond funds, such as those that own government bonds and
blue-chip corporate bonds, saw hefty cash inflows last year as market
interest rates tumbled, driving up the value of older bonds paying
higher yields.</TE>
<TE>   The buying continued in January and February. Bond funds had net
cash inflows of $10.5 billion in January and $10.7 billion in
February, the Investment Company Institute said.</TE>
<TE>   But yields on government bonds have soared this month amid
surprisingly robust economic data. That has depressed the share
prices of many bond funds, scaring some investors away.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard estimates that bond fund purchases slid to $1.2 billion
this month from $2.5 billion in February, Demming said. Fidelity said
its bond and money market funds have had modest cash outflows this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Industrywide, money market funds had a net cash outflow of $5.45
billion in February, compared with an inflow of $14 billion in
January, the Investment Company Institute said.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional investors, rather than small investors, were
responsible for last month's outflow: Money funds offered primarily
to institutions had an outflow of $10.1 billion, while funds offered
primarily to individuals had an inflow of $4.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Total assets of money funds stood at $2.3 trillion at the end of
February, compared with $962 billion in bond funds and $3.3 trillion
in stock funds.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts believe that record-low yields on money funds may
encourage more investors to shift cash from those funds to stocks as
the economy rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   The average seven-day annualized yield on taxable money funds
stood at 1.36% as of Tuesday, according to money fund tracker
IMoneyNet.com. Until the Federal Reserve begins to raise its
benchmark short-term rate, money fund yields aren't likely to
increase significantly, analysts noted.</TE>

<TE>   Instinet May Post Loss Over Trading-Fee Cuts</TE>
<TE>   Weak stock market volume has triggered a heated battle for
business among once-vaunted electronic trading networks.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet Group Inc. said Wednesday that it may post a
first-quarter operating loss because the electronic stock-trading
network has cut trading fees to lure more institutional customers.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Instinet said it will reduce annual operating costs
by $120 million, double its previous estimate of $60 million. The
company also expects restructuring charges of $55 million in the
first half, more than double its original forecast of $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock has fallen 35% this year as competition
prompted a price war between Instinet and rival trading network
Island ECN Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet and Island are private networks that allow big investors
to trade directly with each other at lower cost than on established
stock exchanges and the Nasdaq market.</TE>
<TE>   Island handled about 11.2% of all Nasdaq-listed shares that traded
in February, while Instinet traded about 10%, according to estimates
from J.P. Morgan Chase.</TE>
<TE>   "Even with the price cuts they've introduced, Instinet is still
having to defend what was once the leadership position," said Richard
Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet's most recent price change amounted to a 60% drop in fees
for brokers, who account for 70% of the firm's electronic trading
business, according to J.P. Morgan Chase estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Instinet shares (ticker symbol: INET) plunged as low as $5.66 on
Wednesday on Nasdaq before recovering to close up 8 cents at $6.49.
The company went public in May, and the stock reached a peak of
$21.75 in June.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Turns Over Papers to House Committee</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The three boxes were 'a little light,' says
spokesman for panel probing accounting practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>House investigators Wednesday began reviewing three boxes' worth of
internal documents from Global Crossing Ltd., the ailing
telecommunications firm accused of using suspect accounting to mask
the company's deteriorating finances.</LD>
<LD>   The documents were delivered late Tuesday to the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, which has said alleged misdeeds at the company
warrant greater scrutiny. It's unclear whether Global Crossing
delivered all the information requested by the committee this month.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks a little light, but we'll know more after we go through
it all," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for committee Chairman W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). "We're not going to be satisfied until we get
everything that we requested."</LD>
<TE>   A team of committee investigators has begun examining the
documents, a process that could take up to 10 days, Johnson said. The
committee expects to interview key people within and outside the
company and may hold hearings on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Artin, a spokeswoman for Bermuda-based Global Crossing,
declined to discuss details of the document delivery, saying only
that it is "part of the company's response to the committee's letter
requesting documents."</TE>
<TE>   The company spent billions of dollars building a worldwide
fiber-optic communications network but never came close to making a
profit.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 28, the company filed the nation's fourth-largest
bankruptcy. The company and its executives, now based mostly in
Madison, N.J., have been battered by controversy ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 12 letter to company Chief Executive John Legere,
Tauzin's committee requested an exhaustive list of information about
the firm's accounting methods, network deals with other carriers,
board meetings, allegations made by a former employee, and executive
compensation, stock options and stock sales.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Olofson, a former vice president of finance at Global
Crossing, in August sent a letter to the company's top attorney that
outlined a string of questionable accounting practices at the firm.
Olofson, who left the company late last year, has sued Global
Crossing over his firing.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson's accounting allegations and others have touched off
investigations and reviews by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the FBI, several congressional committees and the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., the quasi-governmental agency that monitors and
insures pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing
at which Legere and Global Crossing Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs
testified about industry accounting methods and fielded sometimes
hostile questions about executive compensation and capacity "swaps"
between firms.</TE>
<TE>   If Tauzin's committee holds hearings, it probably will hear
testimony from Olofson and other Global Crossing critics.</TE>

<HD>Gold Futures' Gain Is Biggest in 7 Weeks</HD>
<DH>Metals: Rush to security in Japan helps boost U.S. prices
to $302.20 an ounce. But analysts have seen such rallies before.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gold market is trying to prove that its latest rally isn't a
flash in the pan.</LD>
<LD>   Gold futures prices scored their biggest gain in seven weeks
Wednesday, boosted by strong buying of the metal in Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese savers, facing a cap on government insurance for bank
deposits starting Monday, have been turning to gold as a safe-haven
investment, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo, Japan's largest seller of gold bullion,
said its sales rose ninefold in February from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Given the country's troubled banking system and the threat of more
bank failures, Japanese investors are "quite scared" by the new
insurance limits, said Leonard Kaplan, head of Prospector Asset
Management in Evanston, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the April gold futures contract jumped $5.40, or
1.8%, to $302.20 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   Gold briefly traded above $300 in early February, then pulled back
modestly. The near-term futures price is up 8.3% year-to-date.</TE>
<TE>   Gold has rallied periodically in recent years, but most of the
rallies have quickly died out. Major central banks around the world
have been heavy sellers of gold reserves in the last decade,
preferring to hold interest-paying bonds instead.</TE>
<TE>   Many gold analysts remain skeptical that the metal can rebound to
its levels of the mid-1990s anytime soon, barring a major shock to
the world financial system or a sustained uptrend in inflation.</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't stopped investors from bidding shares of
gold-mining companies sharply higher this year. A gold-stock index
tracked by the Chicago Board Options Exchange surged 6.3% Wednesday
to its highest level since October 1999. The index is up 36% since
Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Among major gold stocks, Barrick Gold (ticker symbol: ABX) rose 76
cents to $18.86 on Wednesday, Placer Dome (PDG) surged 73 cents to
$12.50, Newmont Mining (NEM) jumped $1.79 to $28.24 and Harmony Gold
(HGMCY) was up 76 cents to $11.69.</TE>
<TE>   Silver prices rallied with gold Wednesday. Near-term silver
futures in New York jumped 9.5 cents to $4.67 an ounce. But silver is
up just 2.2% this year.</TE>

<HD>New-Home Sales Fall Short of Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Housing: Increase of 5.3% in February is seen as a sign
that the real estate boom is slowing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. builders sold fewer homes than expected in February, indicating
the housing boom that helped sustain the economy through the
recession is tapering off.</LD>
<LD>   The 5.3% increase brought the annual sales rate to 875,000 new
single-family homes from 831,000 in January, the Commerce Department
said. That compares with a record 907,000 new homes sold in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "Home buying remains solid but it's no longer steadily
increasing," said Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen
Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. "This will limit housing's effect on
boosting the economic recovery."</LD>
<TE>   The interest rate on 30-year mortgage loans rose to 7.14% this
week, the highest since the first week of January, and that may
dampen sales in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Still, KB Home and other builders are faced with a growing backlog
of homes sold and not yet started. That's likely to keep construction
companies busy for much of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had expected February sales to rise 8.1% from January's
pace. New homes account for 15% of all houses sold.</TE>
<TE>   Housing and related services account for about 14% of gross
domestic product, according to the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   The backlog of houses sold and not yet under construction rose to
27,000 last month, the highest since June 2001, from 22,000 in
January. Builders in February also were working on and completing
about the same number of homes that they were 12 months ago, the
government's statistics showed.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.-based KB Home, the third-largest U.S. builder by homes sold,
had two quarters' worth of orders awaiting construction.</TE>
<TE>   Prices may head higher as builders are faced with higher costs for
raw materials. The price of lumber reached a six-month high this
month as the U.S. prepared to set duties averaging 29% on Canadian
imports. Opponents of the tariffs say the tax will add about $1,500
to the cost of a new home.</TE>

<HD>Dow Gains as End of Quarter Nears</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Bargain hunters and institutional investors
filling out their portfolios propel blue chips. The Nasdaq index sees
only a slight lift. Trading is light.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue chips enjoyed a solid advance Wednesday--the second in a row--as
investors continued their search for bargains and big institutions
bought stocks to dress up their portfolios as the end of the first
quarter approached.</LD>
<LD>   But tech shares, which many market analysts predict will be the
last to recover from recession, rose only slightly after struggling
to stay in positive ground.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 73.55 points, or 0.7%,
at 10,426.91. That followed the Dow's 71-point advance Tuesday, which
broke a four-session losing streak that began after the Federal
Reserve indicated it might raise interest rates this year to keep
economic growth steady.</LD>
<TE>   That stretch of declines made the blue chips much more attractive
to investors Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The market's broader indicators had a more modest advance. The
Nasdaq composite index inched up 2.58 points, or 0.1%, to 1,826.75,
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 6.09 points, or 0.5%, to
1,144.58.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by a 2-1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange
and by about 4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was light, as it has been all
week as traders prepared to celebrate Passover, which began
Wednesday. Also, the market will be closed in observance of Good
Friday, making today's session the last of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed some of the market's upturn to what's known as
window dressing, an end-of-the-quarter practice in which
institutional investors, including mutual fund managers, buy shares
that have performed well recently, to make their portfolios look more
impressive in reports to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market was helped by relative calm in the bond market,
where yields were little changed.</TE>
<TE>   Financial stocks gained after a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst
said banks' profits probably will benefit from higher margins as
revenue from lending increases while losses from bad loans stop
growing.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, the biggest financial-services company and parent of
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney, gained 85 cents to $50.
American Express climbed 59 cents to $41.19.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for recovery boosted shares of many manufacturers and
commodity companies. Heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar gained $1.24
to $57.49.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector was mixed. IBM rose 49 cents to $103.39. But
optical networker Ciena fell 33 cents to $8.07, a day after saying it
was cutting 22% of its work force.</TE>
<TE>   Gold shares continued their recent climb as the precious metal
rose $5.40 to $302.20 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's next big challenge will be first-quarter corporate
earnings reports. Though the results will be better than the previous
quarter and even slightly above expectations, they won't be robust,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of defense contractors rose after a trade publication
reported that the Department of Defense might allow them to earn
greater profits on contracts. Lockheed Martin, the largest defense
firm, advanced 92 cents to $58.15. Northrop Grumman climbed $4 to
$111.50. Boeing, the largest aerospace company, rose $1.54 to $47.33
and United Technologies, which makes Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines,
rose $1.75 to $73.75.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers defending Microsoft Corp. in a landmark antitrust case tried
to show Wednesday that Novell Inc. and other Microsoft critics are
backing the government's antitrust case to advance their own
commercial interests.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft lawyer Michael Laco vara introduced an e-mail written by
Novell Chief Technology Officer Carl S. Ledbetter that suggested the
Orem, Utah, software company could use the antitrust litigation to
get more of its software bundled with copies of Microsoft's flagship
Windows product, which runs more than 90% of personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   "If what we are doing in the states' antitrust case creates a
crack in [Microsoft's] resistance, we may have a way to renew the
offer," Ledbetter wrote in a Dec. 7 e-mail to Novell Chairman Jack L.
Messman.</LD>
<TE>   "We need to infiltrate the Microsoft strategy; after we get in, we
can then proliferate," Ledbetter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Novell and other rivals have contended that Microsoft should be
compelled to disclose more of the technical underpinnings of Windows
so that other developers can make their products more
Windows-compatible.</TE>
<TE>   Novell is backing the nine states and the District of Columbia
suing Microsoft to force the software giant to create a modular
version of Windows that would allow computer makers and consumers to
substitute products such as Web browsers and multimedia software.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft attorneys introduced Novell product literature and news
releases that declared that many flagship Novell products work fine
with Windows.</TE>
<TE>   After showing a Novell document that proclaimed that the company's
DirXML Web server "provides cross-platform support" and "out of the
box connectivity" to a variety of PC operating systems, Lacovara
asked Ledbetter if the statements were true.</TE>
<TE>   "They are accurate" to a point, Ledbetter responded.</TE>
<TE>   He added that Novell's software will perform as advertised but
lacked certain features when used with Windows because of
compatibility issues Novell has been unable to resolve with
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The trial in U.S. District Court was ordered by a federal appeals
panel last year after it ruled Microsoft violated U.S. antitrust
laws. The proceedings are expected to last until the end of May.</TE>

<HD>Morton's Restaurant Group to Be Sold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morton's Restaurant Group Inc., a struggling high-end steakhouse
operator, said Wednesday that it has agreed to be acquired by New
York investment firm Castle Harlan Inc. for $53 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Morton's and many other upscale steakhouses have fallen on tough
times as business travel has plummeted and corporate expense accounts
have been slashed, especially after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The New Hyde Park, N.Y., operator of 61 Morton's of Chicago
steakhouses and four Bertolini's Authentic Trattorias eked out a
profit of $990,000 last year, but that was a 90% drop from the
previous year. Sales last year fell 9% to $237.1 million.</LD>
<TE>   Under the terms of the deal, Morton's stockholders would receive
$12.60 for each share, a 9.1% premium over Tuesday's closing price of
$11.55 and more than a 26% premium over the average price for the
last 20 trading days, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Morton's stock jumped $1.23, nearly 11%, on news of the sale
Wednesday, to close at $12.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. The
deal is expected to be completed by early summer.</TE>
<TE>   During the sluggish economy of the last year, the upscale
steakhouse sector has been among the hardest hit in the restaurant
industry. Smith &amp; Wollensky Restaurant Group, based in New York,
posted a $4.3-million loss on sales of $73 million last year,
although it reported a tiny profit in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana-based Ruth's Chris Steak House Inc., the nation's
largest high-end steakhouse with 82 restaurants, said sales were off
nearly 4% last year, to $316 million. Ruth's Chris was taken private
by an equity firm in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless you've got an expense account, you can't afford places
like Morton's and Ruth's Chris," said Hal Sieling, a Carlsbad,
Calif., restaurant consultant. "They're too darn expensive."</TE>
<TE>   The average check at Morton's is $72 per person.</TE>

<HD>Napster Dispute Puts Bid on Hold</HD>
<DH>Internet: Bertelsmann halts talks as the service's
investors fight over how to divide money from a sale, shareholders
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German media giant Bertelsmann has been negotiating to buy Napster
Inc. for $15 million to $30million, but the talks are on hold because
of infighting among Napster's other investors, shareholders in the
closely held firm said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute focuses on how much the song-sharing service is worth
and how that money should be divided among Napster's several classes
of shareholders, investors said. The fight surfaced this week when
founder John Fanning sued to have two members of the Silicon Valley
firm of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners removed from Napster's board.</LD>
<LD>   Hummer Winblad invested $13.5million in Napster two years ago, and
Fanning's lawsuit aims to prevent the venture capital firm from
keeping most of the money from a purchase. Under the terms of its
investment, Hummer Winblad could cash out before other shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   Fanning and other investors want to convert Hummer Winblad's
preferred shares to common, meaning more shareholders would see money
from a sale. But Hummer partners John Hummer and Hank Barry say the
conversion is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Fanning's suit says Hummer and Barry are disputing a move by a
majority of shareholders to have them replaced as Napster directors.
It asks the court to resolve the crisis quickly, citing an
unspecified offer to purchase the company.</TE>
<TE>   Several investors said the offer was from Bertelsmann, which wants
the conflict ended before it renews its bid. Bertelsmann declined to
comment, but sources close to the company said it had not committed
to buying Napster.</TE>
<TE>   Napster Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers called the suit "legally
groundless." Fanning, Hummer and Barry all declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy in the legal case is complex, and the underlying
agreements have not been made public.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began after word spread among Napster shareholders
that Napster's board was considering the buyout from Bertelsmann,
which has loaned the Redwood City, Calif., firm more than $60 million
and has the right to take a large equity stake in it.</TE>
<TE>   Napster's board consists of Fanning, who incorporated the firm in
1999, Hilbers, Hummer and Barry, who served as CEO before Hilbers
joined the company last year. Fanning's nephew Shawn Fanning, who won
world fame for writing the software that attracted more than 50
million users seeking free music, still works at Napster but is not a
director.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the possibility of Hummer Winblad keeping most of the
money from a purchase, Fanning and his allies activated clauses in
shareowner agreements that they say permit them to convert all of the
classes of preferred shares into common stock. Among other things,
that move gave the investors greater voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   The group, armed with a claimed majority of common stock, then
voted to remove Hummer and Barry from the board and replace them with
Martin Kay, who works at Fanning's Internet-company incubator, and
Yosi Amram, a Napster investor and former director.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, Hummer and Barry refused to recognize
the stock conversion as legitimate. As a result, the suit says,
Fanning expects them not to accept the election of the new directors
either.</TE>
<TE>   Although Napster and the Hummer Winblad team declined to outline
their defenses, a person close to the company said Fanning's side did
not have the right to convert the preferred shares to common.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Fanning's allies against Hummer Winblad, speaking on
condition they not be named, said they hoped for a negotiated
settlement that would allow the Bertelsmann talks to resume.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase price would be far less than the market value once
predicted for Napster, which became the fastest-growing Internet
application in history. But the service was shut down by an
injunction after it was sued for alleged copyright infringement by
the major record labels. Napster is developing a service that would
pay copyright holders and is trying to reach a settlement with the
labels. "It's important to get more financing for Napster,
Bertelsmann has been a great partner, and it would be a shame if ...
greed got in the way," a person close to Napster said.</TE>

<HD>FCC to Return Wireless Deposits</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Carriers who bid for repossessed licenses will get
back $2.8billion, but agency warns case is pending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY PELOFSKY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless Inc. and other major mobile telephone carriers will
get back $2.8 billion, or 85%, of down payments they made to the
government for disputed wireless licenses, the Federal Communications
Commission said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen carriers who bid for the licenses last year wanted the
down payments back because they were not able to acquire and use the
airwaves, have lost millions in interest and could use the money to
expand and improve services.</LD>
<LD>   "This action will give the bidders access to the bulk of their
money while at the same time preserving the results and integrity" of
the 2001 sale, the FCC said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Although it agreed to return the funds, the FCC warned that if it
wins a pending court case over whom the licenses belong to, the
mobile telephone companies will be responsible for the down payments
and the entire amount bid for the various licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The carriers made $3.3 billion in down payments for licenses the
FCC tried to repossess from NextWave Telecom Inc. and UrbanComm-North
Carolina Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC sold the various wireless licenses from the two carriers
to the others for about $16.3 billion in January 2001, but that sale
was thrown into jeopardy when an appeals court ruled that the agency
could not repossess the licenses from NextWave because it had not
paid for them on time.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court has agreed to review the dispute, with a
decision expected next year, but in the meantime, the agency
acquiesced to a request by the carriers to get back most of their
down payments, offering them 85% of the amount they deposited with
the government.</TE>
<TE>   The 13 carriers, including Verizon, VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and
partners of AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and Cingular Wireless, asked
for the money back so it could be used to expand and improve
services.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC will keep 3% of the total amount bid by the carriers,
which is the penalty assessed if all the carriers were to withdraw
their winning bids.</TE>

<LD>Esther Horn earned her wings.</LD>
<LD>   The Dana Point resident, who didn't start flying until she was 29,
marked a milestone Wednesday night when she became the first female
pilot at American Airlines to leave the cockpit because of the
mandatory retirement age of 60.</LD>
<LD>   A captain on American's 757 and 767 jetliners, Horn ended her
career by touching down at John Wayne Airport in Orange County after
a flight that originated in Las Vegas and stopped at the Dallas-Fort
Worth home of American, a unit of AMR Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Federal regulations require commercial pilots to retire when they
turn 60.</TE>
<TE>   Horn always had dreamed of flying. But as a single mother in her
late 20s, she was working as a manicurist when she took her first
flying lesson for fun. She made her first solo flight from Torrance
Airport in 1971, received her private pilot's license the next year
and joined now-defunct Western Airlines in 1979. She then went to
AirCal, which was bought in 1987 by American, now the world's largest
carrier.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first kidney dialysis system that can be used at home was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to Aksys
Ltd., which makes the machine.</LD>
<LD>   The company's Personal Hemodialysis System will allow people with
chronic kidney disease to perform short daily dialysis at home--say
for an hour or an hour and a half, four or five times a week--instead
of traveling three times a week to a dialysis clinic, where the
process takes about five hours.</LD>
<LD>   Aksys Chief Executive William Dow said about 70% of chronic kidney
failure patients in the U.S. could use the at-home system.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Lincolnshire, Ill.-based Aksys, which rose 12 cents to
close at $4.56 on Nasdaq before the regulatory clearance was
announced, soared 59% to $7.25 in after-hours trading on Instinet.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies diapers, pledged not to
violate securities laws in settling a Securities and Exchange
Commission case over the company's 1999 earnings restatement.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark said in an SEC filing it agreed to
settle the case without paying a fine and without admitting or
denying it broke securities laws and SEC rules. John Donehower, chief
financial officer at the company, settled a case brought against him
personally on the same terms.</LD>
<LD>   Kimberly-Clark restated five years of income statements in 1999
after an SEC review found improper accounting for its 1995 purchase
of Scott Paper Co. as well as related job cuts and plant closings. At
the time, the company reduced write-offs taken in 1995 and 1997 while
lowering income in 1996, 1998 and the first quarter of 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Kimberly-Clark shares rose 15 cents to $64.13 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said a German, Rolf Eckrodt, will be its new
chief executive--a move seen as boosting partner DaimlerChrysler's
influence at the ailing Japanese auto maker.</LD>
<LD>   With Eckrodt's promotion, Mitsubishi becomes the third Japanese
auto maker to install a foreigner at its helm as the weaker firms
seek overseas help amid rapid consolidation in the global auto
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Eckrodt, who was brought in from DaimlerChrysler in 2001, also
will oversee the truck and bus operations, suggesting faster
restructuring there.</LD>
<TE>   The 59-year-old's appointment will take effect June 25 with
outgoing President Takashi Sonobe becoming chairman.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continental Airlines Inc. broke off a ticket-selling alliance with
America West Airlines after the smaller company cut fares to draw
last-minute travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Continental decided to end the seven-year code-sharing agreement,
which allows the partners to book tickets on each other's flights, on
May 1 because revenue from it "was approaching zero," a spokesman
said. An accord on frequent-flier benefits and airport clubs will end
Sept.24.</LD>
<LD>   America West on Monday cut fares as much as 70% on tickets bought
shortly before travel and dropped a required Saturday night stay to
lure more last-minute passengers--a main source of airline revenue.</LD>
<TE>   Continental called that evening to say the alliance would end,
said Scott Kirby, the smaller carrier's executive vice president for
sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix-based America West Holdings Corp.'s shares rose 20 cents
to $5.55 on the NYSE. Houston-based Continental fell 2 cents to
$27.85, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>A federal judge granted the Securities and Exchange Commission an
emergency order to shut down a scheme that allegedly bilked investors
out of $98million and targeted their retirement money.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC has charged that Resources Development International of
Tacoma, Wash., and almost a dozen other people and corporations stole
from more than 1,300 people. The commission said they were duped into
investing in fake European financial instruments.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer in Dallas ordered RDI's

return the millions of dollars they sent to offshore accounts,

pursued under former Chief Executive Jacques Nasser.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the settlement in the case--one of several recent

second-largest auto maker behind General Motors Corp.--were not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   In his suit, filed in June in Wayne County Circuit Court in
Detroit, John Kovacs alleged that he was passed over repeatedly for
promotion because of Ford's diversity initiative.</LD>

<HD>Toyota Vows to Roll Back Oldometer With New Line</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Against a backdrop of pop music unfamiliar to just about anyone older
than 25, Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday introduced its new Scion
line of vehicles, the latest effort by Japan's top auto maker to
reconnect with younger buyers.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota, whose average customer is older than those of Ford, Honda,
Nissan or Mitsubishi, is worried that it has lost touch with the
segment of the population that will be the biggest group of car
shoppers 20 years from now. Hoping to bridge that gap, company
executives displayed a pair of compact, toylike concept cars at the
New York International Auto Show, to the tunes of bands such as the
Rurals, Fauna Flash and Schooly D.</LD>
<LD>   It was a bold announcement on the order of the birth of Lexus or
Infiniti, the luxury brands of Toyota and Nissan Motor Co., and the
first introduction of an all-new car brand to the American market
since General Motors Corp. launched Saturn in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   The Scion launch will be aimed squarely at California, the
trend-setting auto market in which Toyota established its U.S.
foothold more than 30 years ago. The cars will be sold only in
California for the first eight months, starting in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new group growing up in our world that we don't know
much about," said Jim Press, executive vice president of
Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales USA. "Today, Toyota is taking a
major proactive step to reach out and connect with them."</TE>
<TE>   To make the point that those who run and write about the auto
business are out of touch with today's youth, Press challenged the
several hundred auto executives and journalists present to identify
the music, saying, "If you're like me, you didn't have a clue. But my
12-year-old daughter did, and your kids probably do too."</TE>
<TE>   The Scion vehicles Toyota showed at the auto show were a compact,
boxy car similar to a mail delivery truck called the bbX, and a
sporty coupe called the ccX.</TE>
<TE>   The bbX, on sale in Japan for two years as the bB, has high
headroom and a rear seat with ample legroom. A single round dial
above the center of the dashboard holds the speedometer, tachometer
and fuel gauge.</TE>
<TE>   The ccX has neoprene seats and a mostly aluminum interior, as well
as features including a large ice chest that plugs into the car's
power source. It is still a concept car, and Press would not say
whether it would join the Scion lineup, but a Toyota source said it
is expected to go into production in about a year.</TE>
<TE>   A third Scion will go on sale within 12 months after the brand
hits Toyota showrooms. Unlike Toyota's Lexus division, Scion will not
have its own dealerships.</TE>
<TE>   Recent efforts with new brands in the U.S. have generally failed.</TE>
<TE>   GM's German Opel brand made a short-lived appearance in the 1960s.
Ford Motor Co.'s experiment with its Merkur brand was a disaster. GM
flagship Chevrolet tried to court the youth market with Geo; its
vehicles were made at GM's joint-venture factory with Toyota, but
many consumers just bought the Toyota versions instead and Geo
withered away. The same fate met Chrysler's Eagle brand.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Toyota itself has already faced a tough road in
reconnecting with America's youth. In 1998 it set up the Genesis
group to figure out how to bring younger buyers to a brand that baby
boomers revered for its reliability but the Net generation considered
out of style.</TE>
<TE>   Three vehicles--the Echo, Celica and MR2--were marketed
aggressively to the youth market by the Genesis group but failed to
gain momentum. Celica sales were down 32% last year, and Echo and MR2
sales declined 13% each.</TE>
<TE>   Rival auto makers were puzzled by Scion and said they failed to
see the need for an entire new brand to reach out to young buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got a well-respected brand, why not take advantage of
it?" said Dick Szamborski, vice president of national sales at
American Honda. "I look at Scion and say, why do it? We don't need to
spend marketing money on a new line--we have Honda."</TE>
<TE>   Jed Connolly, general manager of the Nissan division, said: "If I
go into a Sony shop, and they try to sell me a television by ABC, I
wonder why? I want the Sony."</TE>
<TE>   Saturn, which introduced its own car Wednesday--the ION--to court
the youth market, says it too can handle Gen-X and Gen-Y on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to create a whole brand to attract a segment of the
market that's already well aware of us," said Jill Lajdziak, Saturn's
vice president for marketing.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts said Toyota's scheme might work. After all, its
Lexus division took only a decade to race past every other luxury
brand to become the best-selling premium marque in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at Toyota over the last 20 years, they've been the
most successful auto company around. I find it tough to argue with
any route they go," said Michael Ward, Salomon Smith Barney's chief
auto analyst. "I don't see how anybody could bet against them."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone could do it, "it would be Toyota," Nissan's Connolly
said. "They have a lot of models and complexity, and maybe they see
the opportunity to subdivide."</TE>
<TE>   Toyota says it sees the opportunity to tap into Gen-Xers, ages 23
to about 36, and the 7- to 22-year-olds of Gen-Y. Last year, those of
Gen-Y age bought 400,000 vehicles in the U.S., but as more members of
that group reach car-buying age, that number will balloon to 4
million in 2010 and 6.5 million in 2020, said Scion Vice President
Jim Lentz, 46, who will spearhead the brand.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota has been working on Scion for about three years, said Yoshi
Inaba, president of Toyota Motor Sales and the one Press credited as
the driving force behind Scion.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt we were losing out in attracting trendsetters. That was
our weak point," Inaba said.</TE>
<TE>   The Echo, which was intended to bring down the age of previous
Tercel buyers, actually raised it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Scion's strategy is different as it targets even younger
buyers. Scion customers will come from among people who don't even
have driver's licenses yet, Inaba said, adding that he expected the
cars' demographics to be close to those of Volkswagen's popular
Jetta.</TE>
<TE>   That would be just what Toyota needs. Owners of VW's Jetta, Golf
and GTI are 37 or younger on average, but the only Toyota vehicle
that has an average buyer age of under 40 is the Celica, at 38,
according to J.D. Power &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Scions, which will be built in Japan and shipped to the port of
Long Beach, will be sold only in California Toyota dealerships until
February 2004, when sales will expand nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   By 2005, the first full year nationwide, Toyota expects to sell
about 100,000 Scions.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. District Court in Los Angeles named California State
Teachers' Retirement System lead plaintiff in nearly 20 consolidated
lawsuits against Westlake Village-based Homestore.com and several
former executives.</LD>
<LD>   CalSTRS, the nation's third-largest public pension fund, said it
lost an estimated $9 million on more than 431,000 Homestore shares
from May 4, 2000, to Dec. 21, 2001. The stock collapsed after the
online home-listings company warned that its results would fall short
of expectations. The market value of the company has fallen from $4
billion in July to about $297.2 million today.</LD>
<LD>   The suits allege Homestore falsified financial statements and
engaged in accounting irregularities.</LD>
<TE>   As lead plaintiff, CalSTRS would receive no payment beyond the
prorated share of any recovery given to all members in the lawsuit,
as well as reimbursement for court-approved expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Also named in the lawsuits are Stuart H. Wolff, Homestore's former
chief executive who resigned Jan. 7; Peter B. Tafeen, former chief
operations officer, and Joseph J. Shew, former chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore shares rose 42 cents to $2.53 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. energy regulators unveiled a new measure to prevent another
California power shortage by allowing Sempra Energy to import more
electricity from Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the boost in imports
could save San Diego residents $3 million per year and California
ratepayers $10 million annually, once upgrades are completed.</LD>
<LD>   The FERC approved an order that allows Sempra subsidiary San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric Co. to recover from ratepayers the cost of upgrading
its Miguel-Mission and Imperial Valley lines stretching across
Southern California and into Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Sempra closed up 15 cents at $24.79 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Staples Settles Lawsuit on Customer Overcharges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staples Inc., a national office supply retailer, has agreed to pay
$375,000 to settle a lawsuit filed against it for allegedly
overcharging California customers with checkout scanners.</LD>
<LD>   The Framingham, Mass.-based company Tuesday agreed to pay a civil
penalty of $343,200 and $31,800 in investigative expenses for the 19
counties and the state agency involved.</LD>
<LD>   The civil suit alleged Staples engaged in unfair business
practices when checkout scanners in its California stores rang up
higher prices than advertised for some products.</LD>
<TE>   "There clearly was no intention to overcharge or to try to
overcharge our customers," Staples spokeswoman Jennifer Rosenberg
said. "This had occurred as a result of a system error and some other
factors."</TE>
<TE>   The retailer also agreed to establish safeguards, which include
designating an employee at each California store to become a "price
auditor." The duties include conducting regular audits and correcting
pricing errors.</TE>
<TE>   Staples also will post a sign at each store telling customers that
if an item scans at a higher price than listed on the shelf or on the
product, it will fix the error and deduct $3 from the product's
price, court documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Staples fell 3 cents to $20.08 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>EU Erects Own Steel Barriers</HD>
<DH>Trade: U.S. officials threaten to go to WTO after
commission imposes tariffs on American imports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Union's head office formally adopted tariffs of up to
26% on steel Wednesday to prevent a feared flood of cheap imports
from countries hit by U.S. protective measures.</LD>
<LD>   Labeling the U.S. tariffs, which took effect last week,
"unfounded, unnecessary and unfair," EU officials said they were
forced to respond in kind to safeguard Europe's own shaky steel
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Warning against "over-dramatization," however, they also appealed
for a truce to avert a transatlantic war.</LD>
<TE>   "The EU is not seeking confrontation," European Commission
President Romano Prodi said. "We are quite simply defending, as we
have to do, our ... interests."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Bush administration said it would ask for
consultations with the EU over the higher tariffs, the first step in
bringing a case against the EU at the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the EU demonstrate injury under the WTO rules when the
United States hasn't even started collecting the new tariffs and
there hasn't been time for an import surge?" asked Richard Mills, a
spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick.</TE>
<TE>   The United States exports more than $1 billion in steel products
to Europe on an annual basis.</TE>
<TE>   Trade commissioner Pascal Lamy insisted the EU was acting "in
strict respect" for World Trade Organization rules, which allow
countries facing a potentially harmful increase in imports to protect
their own industry temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   EU steel imports have gone up 18% since 1998, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The EU charges that the U.S. tariffs, which range up to 30%, are
unjustified because U.S. imports have declined by 33% during the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, however, looked at imports of 10 steel products
between 1996 and 2000, the last year for which full-year data were
available.</TE>
<TE>   It showed imports were at their highest levels for seven of those
products in 2000, and at their second-highest levels for the other
three, a U.S. trade official said.</TE>
<TE>   The EU measures are to take effect next week and last for at least
six months--unless President Bush changes U.S. policy before that.</TE>
<TE>   "These measures won't last a day longer than the American
measures," Lamy said.</TE>

<LD>The California Supreme Court agreed to review an appeals court
decision that said a fired Intel Corp. worker was guilty of
trespassing when he inundated the company with critical e-mails.</LD>
<LD>   Five of the seven justices agreed to set aside the lower court's
December ruling in a case testing whether free-speech protections
extend to business e-mail systems.</LD>
<LD>   The case concerns former Intel engineer Kourosh Kenneth Hamidi,
who inundated the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company's computer
servers with e-mails after he was fired in 1995. The e-mails went to
as many as 30,000 workers.</LD>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Carly Fiorina said most shares in
employee stock programs were voted for the Compaq Computer Corp.
acquisition, contradicting claims of widespread worker opposition by
dissident director Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   In a memo to employees, Fiorina and Compaq CEO Michael Capellas
said they were gratified that according to a preliminary tally of
last week's shareholder vote, the $19-billion deal won support of a
majority of shares held in HP's employee stock-purchase plans.</LD>
<LD>   A proxy firm in Delaware is expected to release the official
results in the next few weeks.</LD>

<HD>Ticketmaster to Buy Soulmates</HD>
<DH>Online: The Australian Internet dating service is expected
to help expand its Match.com.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ticketmaster, the world's largest retailer of tickets for concerts
and sports events, said it agreed to buy Australian Internet dating
service Soulmates Technology for $23 million in new stock to help its
Match.com service expand worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Ticketmaster expects closely held Soulmates to add revenue of $5
million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of $2 million a year, said Chief Executive John
Pleasants.</LD>
<LD>   Soulmates delivers personal ads in 30 countries in 18 languages,
he said. Its technology also is used to distribute personal ads on
Microsoft Corp.'s Microsoft Network.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe that the online matchmaking business is a very
explosive one," Pleasants said. "This purchase positions us strongly
and the challenge is ours now to maintain our leadership position."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster shares rose 36 cents to $28.58 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney-based Soulmates had a loss before interest taxes,
depreciation and amortization of $80,000 last year, Pleasants said.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction is expected to close next month, Pleasants said.
Soulmates has 2 million registered users, Ticketmaster spokeswoman
Kandus Kane said.</TE>

<LD>Eight days after Santa Anita had its first 2-year-old race of 2002,
Golden Gate Fields will get into the act this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the horses in these two-furlong races will probably be
nothing more than memories a year from now, but the quarter-mile dash
will be part of the day's pick six, which, like Santa Anita, has a
carryover. The much larger one is local with $125,839 awaiting
players.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old race is the fourth on the card.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Daily Racing Form, trainer Jeff Bonde has won
with 24% of his last 103 2-year-old starters and he is hitting at 18%
with his last 49 first-time starters.</TE>
<TE>   A winner with 27 of his first 99 runners at the current Golden
Gate Fields meet, Bonde will be represented by Bella Bimba, a
daughter of Siphon.</TE>
<TE>   From the rail out, the rest of the field includes Always Remember,
a son of Open Forum, who is in turn a son of Deputy Minister; Bang, a
Ballistic Billy colt; the B. Hoedown colt B. Lucky; Cash Creek, a
Makaleha gelding; B. Good Hero, who is a Sea Hero colt; Bank On Slew,
a daughter of Slewdledo; Souvenir's Lad, a son of Souvenir Copy who
had a debut winner at Santa Anita last week; Dr. Batonnier, a gelded
son of, surprise, Batonnier; and the filly Ama Ray, a daughter of
Xray.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Johar will try to remain unbeaten on the grass in
today's seventh at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Mellow Fellow, who won his fifth in a row for trainer
Bill Morey Jr. when he took the Danville Handicap on Sunday at Golden
Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Trainers Harry Nelson, Robert Sides, Danny Velasquez,
Scott Craigmyle and Juan Cervantes, who are 0 for 65. Each has a
starter in today's first at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Bold Mind and Cobra Son in
the fifth, singling La Bandera in the sixth, using Johar, Western
Stranger and Saphir Indien in the seventh and using Ship Ahoy, No
Toro, Crestbrook and Evil Rumors in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/185. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $8/$1,094.20. Total money bet: $1,132.</TE>

Pet Peeves. Between them, the two veterans, who are a combined 19
years old, have won 33 of 150.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-2 morning line favorite is Mystical Sign, a 5-year-old
gelding trained by Paul Jones. He's facing lesser competition after
checking in fifth as the 6-5 favorite on Feb. 24.</TE>
<TE>   In the opener, the first of the thoroughbred races, Zipolator will
be looking for his third win in his last four starts at Los Alamitos.
In his first race of the year for trainer Chuck Treece, the
6-year-old gelding went wire-to-wire as the 9-10 favorite and should
be tough to catch again.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Zipolator. 2. Live Withit Willie. 3. Mean Gene. 4.
Riggin Lady. 5. Murr Key Blurr. 6. Just A Berry. 7. No Pet Peeves. 8.
Lotta Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Four! The pick four has become one of the most popular exotic bets
offered in California, and Los Alamitos is where it originated. Each
night, we'll suggest a pick four where the investment will never
total more than $36. This evening, single Zipolator in the first, use
Live Withit Willie, Royal Juno Bug and Mr. Ney in the second, Mean
Gene and Eraser Reb in the third and Riggin Lady, Watch Tower and
Crystal 'N Reign in the fourth. Total cost: $18.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: A pair of longshots to look at are
Synthingaboutmerry (8-1 on the morning line) in the sixth and Jolinos
Dasher (6-1) in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 7:15 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Edward Dorado of La Puente was channel surfing when an image of a
startling newspaper headline suddenly appeared on his TV screen:
"Sheriff Baca Resigns." If you haven't heard the news, it's because
the headline had nothing to do with the L.A. County sheriff. Rather,
Dorado had tuned into a 1950s Disney series that starred Robert
Loggia as a Western lawman named Elfego Baca.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Make your reservations early: How feverishly are overseas
destinations working to lure back American travelers? Writer Norm
Sklarewitz of Hollywood received a news release touting a tour of the
public restrooms of Seoul, South Korea. Cost is $24 for the
two-plus-hour walking expedition, says the Korean National Tourism
Organization.</LD>
<TE>   Highlights include the opportunity to enjoy the "best night view
[of Seoul] from a restroom," a restroom that offers "unique
paintings" and a third where guests may sample "Turkish Hakka
cigarettes."</TE>
<TE>   Quipped Sklarewitz: "Why can't the L.A. Convention and Visitors
Bureau come up with ideas like that?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Places to go (cont.): Actually, several months ago I did find a
private Web site that gave out tips on noteworthy restrooms in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Among those lauded were the facilities of the Hotel W in Westwood,
which were described this way: "The black marble is exquisite and the
porcelain could not be whiter. The most impressive thing, however, is
the fine quality of the disposable towels."</TE>
<TE>   Alas, the Web site address seems to be defunct. I guess it went
the way of a lot of other Internet businesses--down the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of unusual tourist stops: Norm Laufe of Laguna Woods was
traveling through Canon City, Colo., when he chanced upon a business
operated by a husband and wife (see photo). "She has a beauty salon,"
Laufe said, "and he details cars and is a taxidermist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You think Beverly Hills stylists are expensive ... Maxine Young of
Rancho Palos Verdes noticed a salon in Torrance with some
eyebrow-raising rates (see accompanying).Wonder if the workers expect
tips, as well?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Trojan reported that officers of the Student Senate "were bewildered

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Molina Floats Idea of Catching All Ortiz Starts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Ramon Ortiz, the Angels' highly talented and highly excitable
pitcher, sometimes needs a friend to calm him down during games.
Bengie Molina, who has caught Ortiz in the major and minor leagues
for the past five years, would like to be that man.</LD>
<LD>   Molina said he does not believe it is his place to ask Manager
Mike Scioscia to catch each of Ortiz's starts. That said, he believes
the Angels ought to consider it.</LD>
<LD>   "I know how to handle him a little better," Molina said. "I think
it would help the team, not taking anything away from anybody."</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz heartily endorses that idea, though he says he also likes
pitching to backup catchers Jorge Fabregas and Jose Molina, Bengie's
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, Bengie's the best catcher," Ortiz said. "Fabregas is very
good. Bengie's brother is very good. But Bengie, oh my gosh. He's a
great catcher."</TE>
<TE>   As the first-string catcher, Molina will catch the majority of
Ortiz's starts. Scioscia said he believes pitchers should be able to
work with all catchers and said he does not want to assign Molina as
the personal catcher for Ortiz in case the Angels want Fabregas'
left-handed bat in the lineup on a day Ortiz starts.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz made his final exhibition start in Wednesday's 8-6 loss to
the Colorado Rockies. Once the regular season starts, Molina promises
to be a big brother to Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, he is listening to everybody. Once the games start, we
have to try to get him focused on the game instead of listening to
everybody," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want anybody to be yelling at him during the games. I
don't want him to be thinking that much. I want to keep things simple
for him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Al Levine, Lou Pote, Ben Weber and Donne Wall assured of
joining closer Troy Percival in the bullpen, the finalists for the
last relief spot are left-hander Mark Lukasiewicz and right-handers
Matt Wise and Brendan Donnelly. Lukasiewicz would be the lone
left-hander in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, 30, could make his major league debut after playing for
14 minor league teams, including two independent teams, during the
last 10 seasons and passing million-dollar busts along the way. He
was signed as a 27th-round draft pick, for $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   "After taxes, $3,500," he said. "I got my wife an engagement ring
and I got myself this chain around my neck, and that was it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio and Troy Glaus, suspended for their roles in the
March 9 brawls against the San Diego Padres, had their appeals heard
here Wednesday by Bob DuPuy, president of Major League Baseball. The
results are expected to be announced by Friday, DuPuy said. The
suspensions, six games for Spiezio and two for Glaus, could be
reduced but will not be overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio said he was "optimistic" his penalty would be lightened
and said he would be disappointed but resigned if it were not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I can appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's off-season commitment to the Angels, evident in the
retention of Percival and Darin Erstad and the addition of Kevin
Appier, Brad Fullmer and Aaron Sele, has not translated into an
overwhelming opening-night response. As of Wednesday, the Angels have
sold 36,000 tickets for Sunday's opener, 9,000 short of a sellout.</TE>
<TE>   In 41 previous seasons, the Angels have sold out their home opener
only twice, both times against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The pregame ceremonies, honoring American heroes, will include
appearances by Olympic gold-medal speedskater Derek Parra and Apollo
11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin.</TE>

<HD>Canseco Released by Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jose Canseco was given his release by the Montreal Expos on Wednesday
after being told he would not be an everyday player.</LD>
<LD>   Canseco, 37, hit .200 with three home runs and five runs batted in
in 14 spring training games.</LD>
<LD>   The former American League MVP has 462 home runs, putting him 22nd
on the career list. But Manager Frank Robinson plans to use other
young players in the outfield.</LD>
<TE>   "We had sat down together last week--Jose and I--and he had shared
with me his feelings about what he felt like he could do for this
ballclub, and under what conditions he could do that," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Jose today that he would not be an everyday player here.
And he had indicated that he didn't think he could be as productive
for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said the Expos offered to let him play as a regular at
Triple-A, but Canseco declined.</TE>
<TE>   "He took it very well, and he took it like a real pro. He
understood and certainly made it a little easier for me," Robinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're dealing with the veteran players, it may be the end
of their careers, you never know, when they don't make it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco signed a minor league contract with Montreal last month,
and new Expo General Manager Omar Minaya hoped he had found a power
hitter for the middle of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Canseco said he felt healthy enough to play a full
season in the outfield. An AL player his entire career, he has been
in the field only 13 times in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   As a designated hitter last year, he hit .258 with 16 homers and
49 RBIs in 256 at-bats for the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs, desperate for a closer after Tom Gordon was
injured, acquired Antonio Alfonseca and pitcher Matt Clement from the
Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   Florida got pitcher Julian Tavarez and three minor
leaguers--pitchers Jose Cueto and Dontrelle Willis and catcher Ryan
Jorgensen.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonseca, who will make $3.55 million this season, led the majors
with 45 saves in 2000. He had 28 saves and a career-best 3.06
earned-run average last season despite pitching with back pain much
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Randy Wolf, who was to be the Philadelphia Phillies' No. 2
starter, will open the season on the 15-day disabled list because of
tendinitis in his elbow. The Phillies put reliever Turk Wendell on
the 60-day disabled list because of tendinitis in his right elbow,
and released pitcher Pete Schourek.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens will pitch the New York Yankees' regular-season
opener in Baltimore on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The six-time AL Cy Young Award winner will be making his 12th
opening-day start, the most since Jack Morris made the last of his 14
season-opening appearances in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   David Wells and Mike Mussina also are scheduled to start in the
three-game series against the Orioles. Andy Pettitte will start the
Yankees' home opener April 5 against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jose Rosado returned to the Kansas City Royals,
agreeing to a minor league contract.</TE>
<TE>   Rosado, a two-time AL All-Star selection, was put on waivers March
10 by the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Rosado has not pitched in the majors since April 30, 2000, and has
had two shoulder surgeries since then.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Karim Garcia, who batted over .300 in five weeks with
Cleveland last season but couldn't win a job during training camp,
was waived by the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 26, was hitting .323 with two homers and 10 RBIs this
spring with the Indians. He no longer has any minor league options
and will become a free agent once he clears waivers.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here trying to win a job, but I understand there's not
much room for me," said Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets claimed two players off waivers, getting
outfielder Chris Latham from the Toronto Blue Jays and first baseman
Andy Tracy from the Montreal Expos.</TE>

<HD>Washington Talks to Romar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saint Louis University confirmed Wednesday that Washington Athletic
Director Barbara Hedges has had an initial conversation with Billiken
Coach Lorenzo Romar about the Huskies' vacant men's basketball job.</LD>
<LD>   "They have spoken briefly by phone," Saint Louis sports
information director Doug McIlhagga said.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Romar nor the school's athletic director, Doug Woolard,
was available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Hedges asked nine-year coach Bob Bender for his resignation last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Romar, a starting guard for Washington from 1978-80, could be the
most logical person to replace Bender, and perhaps the most
interested. Romar, 43, would know what he's getting into, having
played there and having coached against the Huskies while working as
an assistant at UCLA from 1992-96.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The five finalists for the John R. Wooden Award, which will be
presented on April 7, were announced. They are: Gonzaga's Dan Dickau,
Maryland's Juan Dixon, Kansas' Drew Gooden, Cincinnati's Steve Logan
and Duke's Jason Williams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico has permission to talk with Oregon State Coach Ritchie
McKay about the Lobos' vacant job, Oregon State Athletic Director
Mitch Barnhart said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Graham, an assistant coach at Oregon, was hired as head coach
at Boise State.... Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski underwent hip
replacement surgery and was in good condition after the two-hour
operation. The 55-year-old coach had his right hip replaced....
Oregon defeated Houston, 54-52, in Eugene to win the women's NIT
championship.</TE>

player at its annual Rockne athletic banquet next month. Instead, the
club's athlete of the year award will go to Ruth Riley, who led the
Irish women to the NCAA basketball title last year.</LD>
<LD>   "And to think there are those who don't believe Bob Davie's tenure
at Notre Dame left no lasting legacy."</LD>

<LD>Losses in three consecutive games have taken a toll on the Clippers'
fragile psyches. The playoff chase suddenly has turned into a sour
experience for the NBA's youngest team (average age: 24.8 at season's
start).</LD>
<LD>   "I don't blame anybody out there but ourselves," said Darius
Miles, 20, the youngest Clipper. "We're playing bad when it's
counting. We're all beat up. We're just trying our best just to fight
through it. We want to make the playoffs so bad, and we're trying. We
just need to play from the start to the finish.</LD>
<LD>   "Every game we lose, it's not because of the refs, it's not
because of the coaches, it's because of the players out there."</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers' latest loss was a dispiriting 107-90 defeat Tuesday
against the Kings at Sacramento. Several times during the game,
teammates could be seen barking at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi, unhappy after picking up his fourth foul,
booted the ball the length of the court and received a technical
foul.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, coupled with Utah's victory over the Houston Rockets,
left the ninth-place Clippers 31/2 games behind the eighth-place Jazz
in the battle for the final Western Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are running out of time. There are only 10 games
remaining, starting Friday against the Suns at Phoenix. They have two
games remaining against the Jazz, including Saturday at Staples
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't handle adversity very well [Tuesday]," point guard Jeff
McInnis said. "Every time things went wrong, we argued among
ourselves. We just weren't together. Our motto all season has been,
'Stick Together.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand's three-point performance Tuesday against the Kings
tied his season low, set Feb. 14 against the San Antonio Spurs. He
sat out the fourth quarter because of flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to make excuses," said Brand, averaging team-leading
totals of 18.2 points and 11.8 rebounds.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Lo Duca to Bat Third, With Karros Seventh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JUPITER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy has finally settled on a lineup, one with
two mild surprises: Paul Lo Duca will bat third, behind Dave Roberts
and Cesar Izturis, and Eric Karros, who has been a heart-of-the-order
hitter for most of his career but is coming off a career-worst
season, will bat seventh.</LD>
<LD>   Lo Duca will be followed by Shawn Green, Brian Jordan, Adrian
Beltre, Karros and Mark Grudzielanek, an alignment Tracy used in
Wednesday's 8-4 exhibition loss to Montreal and probably will employ
Tuesday against San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "Eric Karros is coming off a tough season, and I want to give him
an opportunity to get himself started and not have people criticizing
him," Tracy said. "And it's time for Beltre to step up a bit. Plus,
there are six guys who can run at the top of the order. If an
outfielder misses a cutoff man, we're going to take a base. You make
a mistake, we're going to grab hold of you."</LD>
<TE>   Tracy believes Lo Duca will help the Dodgers manufacture runs. If
Roberts, for instance, leads off with a walk, steals second and is
advanced to third by Izturis, Lo Duca makes the kind of consistent
contact required to score a runner from third with less than two out.
Lo Duca struck out only 30 times in 460 at-bats last season.</TE>
<TE>   "A run early in the game is very important, and I don't want Shawn
Green to feel compelled to change his approach [to score a runner
from third]," Tracy said. "He'll have several more run-producing
opportunities because of the guys in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little more athletic, a little faster than we were a year
ago. I read a lot of articles about how bad our on-base percentage
was at the top of the order. When you see something that's not
working, you have to do something to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, who hit .235 with 15 home runs and 63 runs batted in last
season but played with a lower-back injury, did not consider the
demotion a blow to his ego.</TE>
<TE>   "My pride went out the window last year; that's not an issue,"
said Karros, who is hitting .153 with no homers and three RBIs this
spring. "I have no argument. If I was managing this team, my lineup
would be the same as it was [Wednesday]. My job right now is to be
the best No. 7 hitter in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Most teams place their best hitter in the No. 3 spot, but Lo Duca,
who hit .320 with 25 homers and 90 RBIs during a breakthrough 2001
season, won't change his approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't put that kind of pressure on myself, because I'd
struggle," said Lo Duca, who homered Wednesday. "I'm just going to go
about my business the way I have. If I have to bunt a guy to third,
I'll do it. Whatever the situation calls for, I'll do it. I'm not
going to try to shoulder the whole team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans had a lengthy conversation Wednesday
with the agent for pitcher Omar Daal, who requested a trade after
being told he would start the season in the bullpen. Evans' message
to Peter Greenberg: Daal isn't going anywhere, unless the Dodgers get
a quality starting pitcher in return.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained to him that it's not in the best interest of the
Dodgers to move him right now unless the situation is right," Evans
said. "It's inevitable that he'll pitch for us this year. We think he
has value, particularly with two starters [Kevin Brown and Andy
Ashby] coming off elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not actively moving Omar Daal. That wasn't the answer
[Greenberg] wanted to hear ... but without a starter ready to come up
from the minor leagues right now, it's imperative for us to protect
our starting pitching depth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Matt Herges has recovered from the shock of Saturday's
trade that sent him from the Dodgers to the Expos. But much like a
visit from his cancer-surviving brother helped him cope with the
frustration of his failed contract negotiations with the Dodgers
earlier this spring, it took another life-altering event for Herges
to come to grips with the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out the other day that my wife [Jane] is pregnant,"
Herges said. "I was talking to her before a game and she said she got
something for me. I opened the bag, and it was a little baby shirt. I
lost it. I felt like an idiot because I was hugging and bawling with
my wife in front of all these fans. Once again, it put things in
perspective. The world is caving in on you, you go to a new team in a
new country, and then this happened."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora, who lost his job to Izturis but will make the team as a
utility infielder, continued to impress the Dodgers with his defense,
ranging deep into the hole at short to field Chris Truby's
fourth-inning grounder Wednesday and making a long, accurate throw to
first.... Hiram Bocachica had two hits, including a home run, and
appears to be the leading candidate over Mike Kinkade, Tom Goodwin
and McKay Christensen for the final roster spot.... Reliever
Guillermo Mota, acquired from Montreal in the Herges trade, gave up
six runs and four hits in the sixth inning.</TE>

<HD>Tverdovsky's Streak Ends at 363 Games</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky was not in the lineup
Wednesday against the Phoenix Coyotes, ending his consecutive-game
streak at 363 games.</LD>
<LD>   Tverdovsky was scratched because of a strained groin in his left
leg, suffered in Friday's game against St. Louis. He played 20
minutes 3 seconds against Dallas on Sunday but was downcast after the
morning skate Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Some things you just can't overcome," Tverdovsky said.</LD>
<TE>   The streak began Dec. 27, 1997, against the Kings and was the
second-longest active one in the NHL. Chicago's Tony Amonte played in
his 401st consecutive game Wednesday. Tverdovsky, who began the
streak while playing for Phoenix, had appeared in 237 consecutive
games with the Ducks, a team record.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second longevity streak to end for a Duck player this
season. Defenseman Keith Carney had a 262-game streak end after
suffering a broken bone in his right hand against Calgary on Nov. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been lucky because I didn't have serious injuries,"
Tverdovsky said. "This is the worst time I ever had. It's different."</TE>

<HD>Coyotes Head Up, Ducks Slide Down</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Phoenix, which missed the playoffs last season,
beats Anaheim to solidify hold on postseason berth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep down, the Mighty Ducks had to be envious.</LD>
<LD>   Their hopes and dreams are being lived by the Phoenix Coyotes.
Both teams missed the playoffs a year ago. Both teams made moves to
change that. The disparity in results was never more apparent than
after the Coyotes' 4-2 victory over the Ducks on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The victory solidified the Coyotes' spot in the playoff race. The
Ducks' postseason hopes  were dashed several months ago. What is left
for them is a final run to get out of the expansion heap and finish
ahead of Minnesota, Nashville and Columbus.</LD>
<TE>   An announced 11,297 at the Arrowhead Pond saw a game of unusual
occurrences. Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky was a no-go because of a
strained groin, ending a 363 consecutive-game streak. Also rare was
German Titov's power-play goal, his second in two seasons with the
Ducks, who rank last in the NHL on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   Titov smacked home a rebound to give the Ducks a 2-1 lead 13
minutes into the second period. It didn't last.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes, who have surged from a .500 team to playoff
contention, rallied on goals by Todd Simpson, Daniel Briere and
Branko Radivojevic to improve their record to 12-3-2-1 in their last
18 games. They are sixth in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes weren't expected to make the playoffs.  They reeked of
a fire smell during the off-season, but things have heated up in the
desert the last two months</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes sent packing Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick, Keith
Carney and Nikolai Khabibulin, among others, since last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They made a lot of changes and no one expected much from them
this season," Carney said. "But they kept good players, Sean Burke,
Claude Lemieux, and some of their younger players have stepped up,
like Daniel Briere."</TE>
<TE>   Those three figured prominently Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Burke wasn't exceptional, but he did stop 25 of 27 shots. He
reacted quickly to block Jeff Friesen's redirect attempt in the first
period. He stoned Mike Leclerc, who burst in uncontested on a
first-period try. He stopped Andy McDonald's point-blank shot in the
third period.</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux broke a scoreless tie by capitalizing on a Duck defensive
gaffe in the first period. Krystofer Kolanos led a rush into the Duck
zone and defensemen Jason York and Vitaly Vishnevski converged on
him. Kolanos passed to  Lemieux, who smoked a shot past goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere three minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Briere gave the Coyotes a 3-2 lead with a power-play goal 26
seconds into the third period when his shot went off Carney's stick.
He also had an assist, giving him 29 goals and 52 points on the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a lot more fun coaching a team like Phoenix this
year than maybe it was in the past," Duck Coach Bryan Murray said.
"You had to worry about certain stars on your hockey team and now you
don't. They have stars, but they are stars-in-the-making type of
thing."</TE>
<TE>   And there are stars that have aligned right for the Coyotes as
well. They got one shot on goal in the second period, and it wasn't
even a real shot. But, it resulted in a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Ladislav Nagy fired a shot toward the net that struck teammate
Todd Simpson in the midsection and went in for a goal, tying the
score, 2-2, 15 minutes into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Duck luck was a bit different.</TE>
<TE>   They had to do without Tverdovsky, who missed his first game since
Dec. 26, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Not that it matters. The Ducks were officially eliminated from the
playoff race after Edmonton defeated Columbus on Tuesday night, which
gave the Oilers 82 points in the eighth and final playoff spot. The
Ducks, who have eight games left, are 20 points back.</TE>

<LD>Forward: Oklahoma loves to get down and dirty in the paint and few
can match the tenacity of the Sooners' 6-foot-8, 250-pound senior
power forward Aaron McGhee, a left-handed version of USC's Sam
Clancy. The Sooners go after loose balls and rebounds like sharks at
feeding time and it all begins down low for them. The Hoosiers, on
the other hand, rely on the fluid game of 6-9, 220-pound small
forward Jared Jeffries. The silky-smooth Jeffries is a matchup
nightmare in the post because if he gets double-teamed, that opens up
the Hoosiers' dangerous perimeter game.</LD>
<LD>   Center: Oklahoma sophomore center Jabahri Brown might get lonely
in the middle because Indiana employs a three-guard, two-forward
lineup. That's fine with the Hoosiers, as the emotional 6-10,
210-pound transfer is averaging more fouls (4.0) than points (3.3)
and rebounds (2.3) in the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Guard: While Indiana's backcourt is the quintessential
stop-and-pop outfit, the Sooners' guards will drive to the basket
just as soon as they'd launch a three-pointer. But when the Hoosier
guards are on--witness the 15 three-pointers they made against Kent
State in the South Regional final--they're tough to beat. Oklahoma
junior shooting guard Hollis Price is the heart and soul of the team.</LD>
<TE>   Coaching: Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson, in his 19th season of
coaching, and Indiana's Mike Davis, in his second, are dealing with
personal issues. Sampson's father fell ill in San Jose at the West
Regional and underwent emergency brain surgery. Davis is still trying
to exorcise Bob Knight's ghost in Bloomington, despite taking the
Hoosiers to the Final Four for the first time since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Final Analysis: Oklahoma, which is riding a 12-game winning
streak, is too relentless, too physical and too talented for Indiana,
especially if Hoosier guard Tom Coverdale is out because of a
sprained left ankle. The Hoosiers are apt to get rattled by physical
play, and that plays right into the Sooners' hands. Just look at what
they did to Arizona in the Sweet 16.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>LPGA's Votaw Stays the Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>Ty Votaw is right about a lot of things, but especially this: The
LPGA Tour is stronger than ever. When 25 of the 31 official events
have prize money of at least $1million and there were only 12 two
years ago, those are good numbers. So is the average tournament purse
that is now $1.19 million.</LD>
<LD>   The LPGA commissioner is only 39 and looks even younger, but
chances are he's going to age a lot faster than he would prefer in
the next five years, which is the length of his ambitious five-year
strategic plan for the 52-year-old LPGA.</LD>
<LD>   Basically, the plan works if the LPGA improves its niche in the
sports entertainment arena, not as "the gender alternative" to the
PGA Tour, as Votaw said.</LD>
<TE>   He had a telling response when asked if the PGA Tour shared the
same concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Said Votaw: "I would think [Tim] Finchem would have some of the
same issues that I'm addressing if Tiger Woods was not on the tour."</TE>
<TE>   There are numerous facets to the plan that would make the LPGA
more "fan friendly." One of them is to call for the top 90 players to
play every event on the tour at least once every four years. Votaw
isn't sure what the penalty would be for noncompliance, but he said
he has four years to work it out.</TE>
<TE>   Votaw emphasized that the LPGA's competition is with every entity
that looks for the entertainment dollar. He says a good way to
increase the LPGA's portion of that dollar is through research.</TE>
<TE>   "What are the reasons why people are watching us and what can we
do better?" he said. "And why are people not watching us?"</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, television represents a major part of the strategic
plan and Votaw wants to increase viewership 10% each year of the
five-year plan. He admitted that broadcast viewership was flat last
year over 2000, but he said that cable telecasts on ESPN were up 28%
overall.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of television, nine hours of the Kraft Nabisco
Championship are being broadcast this week, more than ever, but there
is a catch: Because ABC is carrying the Shell Houston Open, only one
hour will be on ABC (as opposed to three hours last year) and the
other eight hours on cable.</TE>
<TE>   It just goes to show what kind of unusual roadblocks the LPGA
faces in its progressive plan. It finally sheds its conflicting dates
with the Players Championship and it still finds its television
schedule dictated by what the PGA Tour is doing. Not only that, but
it ran into its own broadcast partner, ABC.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy out there, no matter how good the product is, and
the LPGA has never been better. As Votaw said, it's not enough just
to be a great golfer anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "That won't move the needle in terms of fan interest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And five years from now, the strategic plan would prove itself
correct. Votaw says it's the only way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not rocket science," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It might be easier if it were.</TE>
<TE>   In This Corner</TE>
<TE>   News item: Nick Faldo, Nancy Lopez and Peter Jacobsen sign up to
do shows on the Golf Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Better idea--get them to do "Celebrity Boxing II."</TE>
<TE>   No, Thank You</TE>
<TE>   Does anyone find it ironic that Faldo is now officially a member
of the media? This is a turn of events that is borderline hysterical
because Faldo has enjoyed a long-running feud with the media. In his
victory speech after winning the 1990 British Open, Faldo thanked the
media "from the heart of my bottom."</TE>
<TE>   This Just In</TE>
<TE>   The Golf Course Superintendents Assn. of America polled nearly 800
members on the course changes at Augusta National. The results: 41%
said moving the tees back would have the greatest impact, 25% said
adding more trees would most seriously impact play and 12% said
moving the tees laterally would be the most significant change.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Woods finishes last at the Players Championship in
putting, averaging 33.25 a round and 36 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Bogus statistic. Woods putted more because he led the
field (tied with Bob Estes) for most greens in regulation, 77.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie, who vowed not to play in the U.S. again because
of heckling and then changed his mind, had only two minor incidents
at the Players Championship. If you're keeping score at home, that's
pretty low on the MontyMeter.</TE>
<TE>   At the 17th on Saturday, one heckler yelled, "Doubtfire, Mrs.
Doubtfire," when Montgomerie walked past.</TE>
<TE>   And at the 18th, another spectator shouted at the Scotsman, "Hey,
Monty, you've got no majors, you're a loser, go back to your own
country."</TE>
<TE>   Two security guards confronted the second heckler, who said no
more.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie would not answer anything except golf questions
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment News</TE>
<TE>   By the way, it was a big week for TaylorMade at the TPC at
Sawgrass, where surprise winner Craig Perks used a TaylorMade 320 Ti
driver as well as the manufacturer's three-wood and irons.</TE>
<TE>   One for the Books</TE>
<TE>   How you know you're having a really bad year: Arthur Andersen was
dropped this week as Callaway's independent auditor after one year on
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the Concept</TE>
<TE>   From the newspaper Scotland on Sunday, on the proposed Major
Champions Tour: "Although the golf on [the tour] essentially still
would be meaningless, it is a concept that has a lot going for it."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how does that work?</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   The Office Depot Championship's junior clinic will be held 4-6
p.m. Tuesday at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Amateurs
invited to play in the Office Depot are Krystal Shearer of
Northridge, a sophomore at UCLA, and 15-year-old Paula Creamer of
Pleasanton, a 2001 AJGA first-team All American.</TE>
<TE>   The Desert Healthcare Foundation in Palm Springs changed the name
of its free breast cancer screening program to the Suzanne Jackson
Breast Cancer Screening Fund. The change is in memory of Suzanne
Jackson, former LPGA director of operations, who died of breast
cancer in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   JoAnne Carner, Judy Rankin, Sophie Gustafson, Pat Hurst, Carin
Koch, Michelle McGann, Nancy Scranton and Sherri Steinhauer will play
in the 12th Betty Ford Invitational Monday at Morningside Country
Club in Rancho Mirage. The event benefits the Betty Ford Center.</TE>

<HD>Sunday Break Survives Scrutiny and Wins Prep Race for Wood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though Sunday Break gave his supporters, his jockey and his
trainer some anxious moments Wednesday at Aqueduct, the 3-year-old
son of Forty Niner got the job done.</LD>
<LD>   Making his New York debut after winning two in a row at Santa
Anita, the prohibitive 1-5 favorite prepped for the $750,000 Wood
Memorial with a one-length victory over four opponents in a $50,000
allowance race.</LD>
<LD>   Before the victory was official, Sunday Break had to withstand a
stewards' inquiry and a claim of foul by jockey Richard Migliore, who
was aboard runner-up Tomahawk Lane.</LD>
<TE>   After being content to track the slow pace set by Tomahawk Lane,
Sunday Break took over early in the stretch under jockey Gary
Stevens, but then drifted in twice. Stevens was able to keep him from
making contact with his opponents and he asserted his superiority in
the final yards.</TE>
<TE>   After a few minutes, the stewards let the result stand.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break completed the 11/8 miles in 1:512/5.</TE>
<TE>   "This race was a good experience," winning trainer Neil Drysdale
said. "He got to playing around in the stretch. Gary said he was just
too relaxed on the front end. I'm still thinking the Wood [on April
13] for him."</TE>
<TE>   Stopping in New York on his way home after a successful Saturday
in Dubai, Stevens remains optimistic about Sunday Break, who was bred
in Japan and is owned by Koji Maeda.</TE>
<TE>   "We got by [Tomahawk Lane] and my horse started looking around at
the grandstand," he said. "He ducked in and I nearly fell off. This
is a good horse. He galloped out an eighth of a mile after the finish
impressively.</TE>
<TE>   "I normally would want to put blinkers on a horse like this, but
this horse is too keen."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, who is sending Medaglia d'Oro east for the
Wood, may have a starter in the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby on April 6
after all.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel said Wednesday that Royal Gem, who is unbeaten in two
races on the turf, could make his main track debut in the Derby. "We
just want to see if he can run on dirt," Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Royal Gem, others being considered for the local Derby are
likely favorite Came Home, Danthebluegrassman, Lusty Latin, Easy
Grades, Fonz's, Jack's Silver, U S S Tinosa, Tracemark and
Mayakovsky.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie"</LD>
<LD>   Where: FX, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   There have been some bad made-for-TV sports movies recently.
ESPN's "Season on the Brink" was pretty much universally panned.
TNT's "Monday Night Mayhem" missed the mark. But this movie about the
point-shaving scandal involving two players on the 1994 Arizona State
basketball team is very good.</TE>
<TE>   Although the message it delivers is poignant and serious, "Big
Shot" has its light moments and is overall very entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   David Krumholtz is excellent as Benny Silman, the central figure
in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Dickerson directed this movie as well as "Monday Night
Mayhem." Here he has the benefit of a better cast, although the job
John Turtorro did playing Howard Cosell and brother Nick Turtorro did
as Chet Forte almost saved "Monday Night Mayhem." Nick Turtorro is in
"Big Shot" and is very believable as Joe Jr., the gambler who led
Silman astray.</TE>
<TE>   Tory Kittles as Stevin "Hedake" Smith, Jennifer Morrison as
Silman's girlfriend Callie, Keith Joseph Lineker as bad guy "Big Red"
and Alex Rocco as big-time gambler Domonic all fit their roles very
well.</TE>

<KH>GIRLS' WATER POLO PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Hayes, Foothill Sure Bets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Great teams traditionally feature more than one exceptional player.
The girls' water polo teams at Santa Ana Foothill High have been no
exception.</LD>
<LD>   This season, Foothill's roster included two members of the U.S.
junior national team and a member of the U.S. youth team.</LD>
<LD>   Add a handful of players who could have starred for nearly any
other high school team in Southern California and it was easy to see
how the Knights were able to cruise to their third consecutive
Southern Section title.</LD>
<TE>   In the middle of all this talent was junior Brittany Hayes, who
led Foothill with 92 goals, assisted on dozens of others and provided
stiff defense against her two-meter counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   These contributions, only slightly better than those of her
teammates, earned her honors as The Times' girls' water polo player
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes was the architect of a flawless Division I championship game
that capped a successful season for the Knights. As she had done all
season, Hayes created many of the plays and made all the right
decisions in the 8-0 victory over Santa Margarita in February that
clinched the title.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes is the first to credit her teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a team sport," she said. "I depended on the other
players so much. Without them, I would not be the player I am."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said she often found extra motivation by making bets with
her father. As a freshman, she was rewarded with a pager after
Foothill won the Division I championship. Last year, she received a
new car after the Knights defended their title.</TE>
<TE>   When Santa Margarita added two seasoned transfers to an already
talented group, many believed the Eagles were the team to beat this
season. All bets were off.</TE>
<TE>   "[Winning a third title in a row] became a lot more personal,"
Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   Foothill and Santa Margarita met for the first time in early
February in a semifinal of the Irvine Southern California
Invitational. The Knights had one of their worst performances of the
season and the Eagles took advantage to win, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw how they celebrated afterward," Hayes said, "and we knew
they wouldn't be ready to play when we met again. It made us a better
team in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   Another turning point for Foothill actually came a week earlier,
when the Knights had to forfeit a nonleague game against Newport
Harbor because Dan Klatt, who shares coaching duties with Dave
Mikesell, attended the game even though he was suspended at the time
for receiving a red card in the previous game.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Knights' first loss in 38 games, and the players
weren't happy. Neither was Klatt, a member of the U.S. national men's
team, whose offer to resign was refused.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, we realized how much we needed our coaches and how
they counterbalance each other," Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   With many of its top players returning, as well as the anticipated
arrival of a top freshman, Hayes is looking forward to winning a
fourth section title.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be pretty amazing," she said. "I told my parents when
I first started high school that I would win four [section]
championships."</TE>
<TE>   And with Hayes, that might be a safe bet.</TE>

<KH>SPOTLIGHT ON TRACK AND FIELD</KH>
<HD>Fakehinde Is Making Huge Impact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rich Davis, chancellor of Fullerton Eastside Christian Schools, knew
that T.J. Fakehinde was special when he arrived on campus in August
of 2000.</LD>
<LD>   But he didn't know the quick-to-smile sophomore would clear seven
feet in the high jump early in his junior track and field season.</LD>
<LD>   Fakehinde, a Nigerian native who moved to Jamaica when he was 10,
arrived at Eastside Christian after an extensive screening process
determined he was a strong candidate for the school's Operation
Impact program.</LD>
<TE>   The program seeks out Christian youth from impoverished
backgrounds in countries such as Jamaica, Russia and Kazakhstan and
tries to develop personal qualities that will help them become
community leaders when they return home.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Section rules regarding transfer students prohibited
Fakehinde from competing in varsity sports during his first year at
Eastside Christian, but his physical talents were obvious when he
cleared 6-4 in the high jump to win the freshman-sophomore division
of the Orange County championships last year.</TE>
<TE>   That was the only competition of the season, and the sixth of his
life, for Fakehinde. But the 6-foot-3, 190-pound junior has cleared
6-6, 6-8 (twice) and 7-0 in four meets this season after earning
All-Southern Section honors in eight-man football during the winter
and leading the Eagles' basketball team to the quarterfinals of the
Division V-A playoffs last month.</TE>
<TE>   "It surprised me a lot," Fakehinde said of his seven-foot jump in
the Surf City Invitational at Huntington Beach High on Saturday.
"Because I did just 6-8 in the last invitational before that one. I
hoped to improve my best, but I wasn't expecting seven feet."</TE>
<TE>   Fakehinde, the lone athlete on Eastside Christian's first-year
varsity track and field team, is coached by Davis, whose athletic
background is in soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Eastside Christian lacks a track facility, so Fakehinde's training
consists primarily of conditioning drills.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he is one of three athletes to have cleared a
state-leading 7-0 in the high jump this season, and Davis figures
it's only a matter of time before he goes higher.</TE>
<TE>   Back on track: Liza Pasciuto of Murrieta Valley appears to be in
superb shape after a disappointing end to her sophomore cross-country
season.</TE>
<TE>   Pasciuto placed sixth in the 2000 national cross-country
championships as a freshman, but passed out during the Southern
Section Division I final on Nov. 17 and failed to finish the West
region championships two weeks later after injuring a knee when she
was inadvertently tripped by a fellow competitor.</TE>
<TE>   She looked good Saturday in winning the 800 meters in 2 minutes
14.5 seconds and the 3,200 in 10:53.9 in the Meet of Champions
Distance Invitational at Azusa Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking 1,600: Junior Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio Mesa set career
bests of 1:58.4 in the 800 and 4:17.1 in the 1,600 last week, but a
fast time in the 3,200 might not be in the near future for the runner
who placed sixth in the section Division I cross-country final.</TE>
<TE>   "To run a fast time in the 3,200, things have to be just right,"
Reid said. "If you get in too fast a race, it can hurt you.... You've
got to be in the right race at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Reid finished a disappointing 24th in 9:32.12 in the 3,200 in the
Arcadia Invitational last year, but plans to run the 1,600 in this
year's meet to be held April 12-13 at Arcadia High.</TE>
<TE>   Fast return: Sprinter Matt Bruno of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills
didn't waste any time last week upon his return to competition after
sitting out the previous 10 days because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno, who suffered the injury running in a semifinal of the
60-meter dash in the National Scholastic indoor championships on
March 10, ran 10.58 in the 100 in a dual meet against Capistrano
Valley last Thursday. He then won the 100 in a wind-aided 10.45 and
the 200 in 21.46 at the Surf City Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   The 10.58 and 21.46 timings were career bests for the UCLA-bound
Bruno, as well as the fastest times in the state this year.</TE>

<HD>Murray Says Latest Loss Is a Low Point</HD>

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>After a videotape review, a 90-minute flight over the Canadian
Rockies in which to ponder it and a light workout in a different city
Wednesday to forget about it, Coach Andy Murray offered his critique
of the Kings' 4-0 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night:</LD>
<LD>   "Our worst game of the year."</LD>
<LD>   Outscored, 8-0, in the first two games of their four-game trip,
the Kings have lost consecutive games for the first time since
mid-November. They've been shut out in consecutive games for the
first time since February 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The last time they lost consecutive games, they responded with a
four-game unbeaten streak that helped turn their season around.</TE>
<TE>   The last time they were shut out in consecutive games, they
responded with a 13-2-5-2 stretch run that carried them into the
playoffs last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to quit now," Murray said. "If we wanted to quit,
we could have quit in November. There's no reason to panic."</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller, however, said he found it "perplexing"
that the Kings showed such little passion against the determined
Canucks after losing two days earlier to the Phoenix Coyotes by the
same score.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we got too comfortable winning [six] games in a row," he
said. "Maybe we started to think we're a little better than we are."</TE>
<TE>   Said defenseman Mattias Norstrom: "We know what a tight race it's
been, and what a tight race it's going to be right down until the
very last game. I don't think we needed a wake-up call, but it is a
wake-up call [to remind us] that we need to bring that little bit
extra every night if we want to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings fell to second in the league in power-play conversion
and penalty-killing percentage after failing to score in six
man-advantage opportunities and giving up three power-play goals
against the Canucks.... Ian Laperriere, who missed Tuesday's game to
stay home with his wife, Magali, after the Monday night birth of
their son, Tristan, rejoined the Kings on Wednesday night and will
play tonight.</TE>

<HD>Referee's Call Puts O'Neal in a Foul Mood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>As if he needed another motor-skill variable at the free-throw line,
Shaquille O'Neal was called for a lane violation Tuesday night when
he lurched into the lane before his shot reached the rim area.</LD>
<LD>   In case he wasn't annoyed enough--what with the offenses that drag
him out to the three-point arc, the defenses that bracket him, and
the aching big toe he is pretty sure will require surgery--O'Neal has
this, another technicality from a league he already considers
"raggedy," or worse.</LD>
<LD>   And while O'Neal glared at referee Greg Willard for the rest of
the game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, by Wednesday evening he was
mostly over it and the issue did not arise in 15 free-throw attempts
against the Phoenix Suns.</LD>
<TE>   "They can do whatever they want to try to stop me," said O'Neal,
who made four of the 15.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why officials might suddenly choose to enforce a rule they
basically ignored for months, he said, "Because they don't want me to
score 50 a game in this ... league."</TE>
<TE>   Should referees overindulge themselves on O'Neal's habit of
prematurely entering the lane, Phil Jackson said the Lakers would
forward to the league office "miles of footage" of similar violations
by opposing players, "if they want to call something as petty as
that."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Jackson said he was amazed at the "gumption" of the
Cavaliers' complaints, seeing that Andre Miller repeatedly set up
with his toe on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll see what happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As Jackson begins to form his postseason rotation, Mitch Richmond
has lost playing time to the triangle-savvy Brian Shaw.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is this: Richmond can't get into a shooting rhythm
without minutes, and the minutes aren't coming because Richmond has
made only 28.8% of his three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   And it is nearly April, a time when the rotation tightens.</TE>
<TE>   "I still like my decision to come here," Richmond said. "I like
Phil and I like the team. But I don't feel like I've gotten the
opportunity to show I can play. The playoffs come, and you want to be
a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks from the postseason, the Lakers probably will not add
a player, General Manager Mitch Kupchak said. That means no big body
behind O'Neal and no Ron Harper.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't anticipate making any changes at this time," Kupchak
said. "It could change--knock on wood--with an injury or a phone
call. But I don't anticipate that."</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. defense has its second bad night in a
row as Phoenix pulls away for 118-106 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal played a less-than-ordinary game, fielded dumb
questions--his description--about it, and then leaned back on a metal
folding chair, lost his balance and smacked the back of his head on a
locker.</LD>
<LD>   Across the room, Kobe Bryant, who had played 34 phenomenal minutes
and then seven mortal ones, burst into laughter at the sight of his
teammate rubbing the back of his head.</LD>
<LD>   "One of them days, buddy," O'Neal told Bryant. "One of them days.
First Jake gets 19, now this...."</LD>
<TE>   While waiting for the Phoenix Suns to miss, a dreary way to spend
an evening when your defense is layup prone, the Lakers went ahead
and added another ghastly loss, 118-106, Wednesday night at America
West Arena. Committed, they have said, to staying with the Sacramento
Kings, and to getting through the easy ones while readying for the
tough ones, the Lakers were outscored, 24-13, in the last eight
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Tsakalidis, the aforementioned, rode high pick-and-rolls for
his 19 points and then left to a standing ovation, an oddity for a
center on a floor shared with O'Neal. Shawn Marion had 32 points and
18 rebounds, and the Suns, awful for weeks, managed to summon the
strength and stamina to play through the Lakers, spotty for months.</TE>
<TE>   On consecutive nights, the Lakers gave up a combined 234 points,
starting with the second-half near-collapse to the Cleveland
Cavaliers at Staples Center. They hadn't been so burned since
December 1996, when they gave up as many points on consecutive nights
in Chicago (to a Bulls team coached by Phil Jackson) and Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, consecutive Laker opponents made
more than half of their field-goal attempts, and the Lakers have
given up at least 30 points in five of six quarters. As a result, the
Lakers lost for the first time in four games and fell a game behind
the Kings in the Pacific Division and Western Conference standings,
with a long weekend of the Portland Trail Blazers and San Antonio
Spurs ahead.</TE>
<TE>   After a very long postgame wait, Jackson pushed through purple
doors and wondered where the defense went.</TE>
<TE>   "We did just about everything possible to mess it up and not even
have a chance to get back in the ballgame," he said. "So, we're
pretty disappointed in that ballgame as a team. It reflected deeply
on how much we played defense, how attentive we were to that."</TE>
<TE>   After a murky 31/2 quarters, the Lakers trailed only 94-93, thanks
in part to Bryant's 17-point third quarter. He reached the end of the
third with 36 points, then did not play the first 5:25 of the fourth
quarter. After he returned, with the Lakers behind, 98-93, Bryant did
not attempt another shot as the offense seemed intent on having
O'Neal bring it back.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just trying to establish some type of rhythm,
offensively," said Bryant, who made 18 of 20 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson didn't know what caused Bryant's apparent reticence. "I
haven't talked to him about that. We went down to Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed an unlikely place for the Lakers to lose, three days
after their victory in Sacramento, against a real live playoff team.
Then, as they stuffed their duffel bags for the short trip home, they
discovered the wait would be at least an hour longer. Their charter
plane, it seemed, had a cracked windshield, so there was nothing to
do but sit and mull a defeat that stood with their worst of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they've gotten good at explaining these.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not worried," O'Neal said. "It's all about us. We let
another slip away. We made it harder on us."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal described himself as "a little slow."</TE>
<TE>   He drew the line at praise for Tsakalidis, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to help [on defense]," he said, more defensive than he'd
been all night. "It's not like he backed me down and scored on me.
I'm surprised you asked that dumb question. I have to help the
guards."</TE>

<HD>Sorenstam Has Set the Standard</HD>
<DH>Golf: After spectacular 2001 season, which included eight
victories, she's set to defend major title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>Last year, Annika Sorenstam won eight tournaments, made more money
than any female golfer ever had, posted the lowest scoring average of
all time, shot a 59, came from 10 shots back on the last day to win a
tournament, set another record with the lowest score ever in relation
to par and generally dominated the LPGA as no player has in decades.</LD>
<LD>   So what do you say after you do all that?</LD>
<LD>   "I was satisfied last year," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Satisfied? Most players would be pretty close to calling it a
career after producing a year like the 31-year-old Swede did. When
they finally finished adding everything up, Sorenstam either set or
tied 30 records in 2001. It was such a good year that after years of
coming close, Sorenstam won at Mission Hills Country Club for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   So when the $1.5-million Kraft Nabisco Championship begins today
at the layout with the lake, Sorenstam will be the defending champion
with a few different goals that she might be able to crank out of
that laptop she carries almost all the time.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to the question of how you follow up your own act has
an answer: Win more majors.</TE>
<TE>   "I won eight times last year [and] it doesn't mean I have to win
nine to make it a better season," she said. "I think that's putting
too much pressure on myself. But I have set some different goals, and
one of the goals is to perform better in the majors."</TE>
<TE>   In that case, this would be a good place to start. Karrie Webb and
Se Ri Pak, the other parts of the LPGA's Big Three, are on hand to
make sure it doesn't happen. Both players showed last year that they
could win majors just as well as Sorenstam, although they also
managed somehow to get lost in the Sorenstam shuffle. Last year, Webb
won the U.S. Open and the LPGA Championship to bring her total of
major victories to five. Pak not only won five times, she also won
the British Open and has three major titles in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, who has been playing five years longer than Pak and is
seven years older, has the same number of major titles. In fact,
Sorenstam's three-shot victory over Webb, Rachel Teske, Akiko
Fukushima, Janice Moody and Dottie Pepper was her first victory in a
major since 1996, when she won the second of her consecutive U.S.
Open titles.</TE>
<TE>   Since she joined the LPGA Tour in 1994, Sorenstam has missed the
cut only seven times in 160 tournaments, but three of them have been
in majors, including the 1997 U.S. Open. Sorenstam blamed her early
departure on putting too much pressure on herself to play well and
win three in a row. She also missed the cut at the 1997 DuMaurier and
at the 1999 U.S. Open, which was her last missed cut in any
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed that majors define a player's career, and Sorenstam
said she could do better. "Of course I'm a little disappointed I have
not done as well in the majors," she said. "Winning last year here
meant a lot to me, knowing that I can do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my game fits really well for majors. I hit a lot of
fairways, I hit a lot of greens. I just think in the past, in some of
the majors, I get too excited. It's almost like I try too hard, and
that's just something I've had to deal with a little bit. When I tee
up [today], I'm going to think it's Thursday and I'm just going to
hit one shot at a time and not think too much about Saturday and
Sunday, which I have done in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The past doesn't matter, starting today, but it is a relaxed and
confident Sorenstam who defends her title. No one has repeated as
champion since the tournament became a major in 1983, so there is the
matter of history against her.</TE>
<TE>   At least her putting won't be against her. When she lost to Teske
two weeks ago at Phoenix, Sorenstam shot a 76 on Sunday, blew a
four-shot lead and lost in a playoff. Afterward, she worked with her
coach, Henri Reis, and said she corrected the putting problem in
about two minutes. The problem was that her hands were too far back
in her motion. Still, Sorenstam wound up in the Phoenix playoff when
her approach shot on the 72nd hole ran through the green and into a
bunker, not because of a putt.</TE>
<TE>   There is still money and possibly some history to be made, and
Sorenstam seems ready for both. Look at it this way: She is already
in the LPGA Hall of Fame, which she accomplished three years ago, so
where exactly do you go from there?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to play," she said. "The question is, is it there
tomorrow? I'll find out. But I'm ready. I'm looking forward to
playing. This is what I've been waiting for."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonzi Wells scored 24 points and started a late run with a
three-point basket as the Portland Trail Blazers defeated San
Antonio, 98-93, Wednesday night at Portland, ending the Spurs'
13-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   Dale Davis added 19 points for the Trail Blazers, who played the
final three quarters without leading scorer Rasheed Wallace, who left
because of a sore lower back.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Duncan had 34 points and 11 rebounds, his 57th double-double
of the season, and David Robinson added 14 points for the Spurs, who
had the league's longest win streak of the season.</LD>
<TE>   With the loss, San Antonio dropped to fourth in the Western
Conference playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Wells, who was knocked woozy in the third quarter when he fell and
hit his head against Davis' knee, sank a three-pointer to break an
87-87 tie with 3:58 to go. The Spurs never got the lead back. They
were seven of 15 from the free-throw line in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 96, Memphis 82--Gary Payton overcame a severe back strain
to score 32 points, leading the SuperSonics at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Rashard Lewis added 12 points and eight rebounds for the
SuperSonics before leaving early in the third quarter because of a
sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Williams led Memphis with 26 points, but he scored only two
points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 81, Miami 80--Morris Peterson scored 21 points, including
a game-winning layup with 8.4 seconds left at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis added 19 points, and Jerome Williams had 18 for the
Raptors, who have won three in a row since Vince Carter opted to have
knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Strickland had 24 points for the Heat, which has lost four in
a row to fall to 11th place in the East, four games behind Indiana.
Miami has 12 games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 88, Philadelphia 80--Richard Jefferson scored 18 of his
20 points in the second half to lead the Nets at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers slipped to 1-9 this season without Allen Iverson, who
probably will miss the remainder of the regular season with a broken
left hand.</TE>
<TE>   New York 89, Detroit 82--The Knicks' Lavor Postell scored a
career-high 20 points in 22 minutes at Auburn Hills, Mich. New York
was without Allan Houston and Othella Harrington, who were sidelined
with ankle sprains.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 102, Golden State 99--Paul Pierce of the Celtics scored
four points in the last nine seconds at Boston and finished with 33
points.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors are 7-29 on the road this season, including 2-12
against Eastern Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 111, Orlando 104--Jamaal Magloire scored 21 points and
Jamal Mashburn added 20 at Charlotte, N.C., as the Hornets extended
their win streak to seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Magloire, filling in for injured starting center Elden Campbell,
was eight of 11 from the field and finished one point short of his
career high.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics activated guard Earl Watson and put forward Art
Long on the injured list.... Jermaine O'Neal of the Indiana Pacers
was suspended for two games without pay and fined $10,000 by the NBA
for throwing punches, and teammates Jonathan Bender, Primoz Brezec
and Bruno Sundov received one-game bans for leaving the bench in a
game against Detroit on Tuesday.</TE>

<KH>FINAL FOUR REPORT</KH>
<HD>Indiana Is Not on Knight's Watch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The question many raised as Indiana marched to the Final Four has
been answered.</LD>
<LD>   Was Bob Knight watching?</LD>
<LD>   The answer is no, according to the Lubbock (Texas)
Avalanche-Journal.</LD>
<TE>   Knight told the newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that
he has not seen Indiana play this season, and he pointed out he had
predicted success for this team.</TE>
<TE>   "I had high hopes for this team; I felt we could win more than 60
games over the next two years with a real shot at the 2002 NCAA
championship," Knight wrote in his recently published book, "Knight:
My Story."</TE>
<TE>   "That was written a year ago," Knight told the Avalanche-Journal.
"It kind of looks like I was right, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   "That's the major reason I went against basic instincts that told
me I needed to get out of there," said Knight, who has said he should
have left before being fired.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana Coach Mike Davis, Knight's former assistant, said on a
conference call Wednesday he has not heard from Knight since becoming
coach after Knight's September 2000 firing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disappointed," Davis said. "There are a lot of guys I've
been close to that I haven't talked to.... It's no problem if we talk
or not."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said this week he isn't concerned by the debate about whose
team it is. (Most of the players were recruited under Knight.)</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to give Knight credit, fine with me," he said.
"We're in the Final Four, and if we win a national championship, the
banner isn't going to say Coach Knight or Mike Davis. It will just
say Indiana."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The optimism that Indiana guard Tom Coverdale will be able to play
Saturday against Oklahoma seems to be diminishing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's about 50-50 that he plays," Davis said. "As of now,
he's still on crutches. Today is Wednesday, and he only has two days
to recover."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana coaches and players had been confident Coverdale could
play despite the pain of a badly sprained ankle, but the injury might
be too severe.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone can play through injury, it's definitely Dane Fife and
Tom Coverdale," Davis said.</TE>

<TE>   French figure skating judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne has testified
that a prominent International Skating Union official took aggressive
action against her minutes after the controversial Olympic pairs
event ended on Feb. 11, the Chicago Tribune has learned.</TE>
<TE>   At a Feb. 20 hearing before two ISU investigators, Le Gougne
alleged ISU events coordinator Peter Krick of West Germany blocked
her from leaving the judges platform for several minutes and
"aggressed me verbally, saying that it is a scandal I have made the
choice for the Russian couple."</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne was among five members of the nine-judge panel who
placed Russians Elena Bereznaia and Anton Sikharulidze first in the
free skate, making them Olympic champions. Among the four who favored
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier was Krick's wife, Sissy.</TE>
<TE>   In the transcript of the Feb. 20 hearing, which the Tribune has
seen, Le Gougne said she knew before the competition "the German
judge [Sissy Krick] was in favor of the Canadian couple."</TE>

<HD>South Park Rerun for Stadium Site?</HD>
<DH>Football: A look at old plans for downtown venue shows spot
near Staples Center, but there are potential problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least three years have passed since Sheldon Ausman last looked at
the architectural drawings. He retrieved them from storage this week
and unfurled them like scrolls, spreading them across the desk of his
Century City office. Before him lay the forgotten plans for a
state-of-the-art NFL stadium in the South Park area of downtown Los
Angeles, a dream derailed when the city cast its lot with the New
Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "South Park has always been a real opportunity," said Ausman, who
in the early 1990s teamed with Lodwrick M. Cook, former Arco
chairman, to form South Park Sports Inc. in order to create the
stadium proposal. "In conjunction with Staples Center, it could be
the focal point in Los Angeles."</LD>
<LD>   The plans could have new relevance. Denver billionaire Philip
Anschutz, who owns Staples Center, is looking into building a
downtown football stadium that will bring the NFL back to L.A. There
are indications he and his high-powered coalition have turned their
attention to South Park--an underdeveloped neighborhood filled with
parking lots and half-empty warehouses--an area just east of Staples.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition includes Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz
Entertainment Group and Staples Center; Casey Wasserman, owner of
arena football's L.A. Avengers; supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle;
and real estate magnate Ed Roski.</TE>
<TE>   An AEG spokesman said Leiweke left on vacation Wednesday and would
not be available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although sources told The Times the project would require about 55
acres, it is now believed the complex could be constructed on a
smaller plot. As a comparative gauge, the Coliseum and all the land
encircled by the sidewalks that border it encompass 28 acres, and it
is more bowl-shaped and almost 25,000 seats larger than modern NFL
stadiums. The Baltimore Ravens' stadium sits on 36 acres, five more
than the new home of the Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   The average city block in L.A. is 600 feet long and 300 feet wide.
One block represents about five acres.</TE>
<TE>   Parking is paramount. According to the original South Park plan,
there were some 24,000 parking spaces within six blocks of the
property and more than 50,000 spaces in the adjacent downtown area.
In general, the NFL wants a stadium to have at least 17,000 available
parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got your parking, you're home free," said John Moag,
chairman of Moag &amp; Co., a Baltimore-based sports investment banking
firm. "If you've got that taken care of, you don't need a whole lot
more than the footprint of the building."</TE>
<TE>   Ausman has not been approached to join the Anschutz group.
Recently, however, the Anschutz coalition, through an intermediary,
asked for a copy of the promotional video that touted the original
South Park stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That plan called for a three-tiered, 72,000-seat facility on a
35-acre area bordered by Grand, Pico, Flower and 11th streets. That
would include a 700-room hotel and 3,500 premium parking spots.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the proposal said the project would create traffic
snarls by cutting off some high-volume streets.</TE>
<TE>   A potential deal-breaker in South Park is the number of low-income
housing units in the area. Anyone who built a stadium would have to
find a new place for those units with at least a one-for-one
replacement ratio, and the replacement units would have to be ready
before residents were displaced.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a 64-unit residential building of affordable housing
for families was completed on the corner of Olympic and Hope streets
in the fall. A developer could be hard-pressed to convince city
fathers it is reasonable to tear that down in the name of NFL
football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fraught with complications," said City Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas, who represents neighboring District 8, which includes
the Coliseum. "The land assemblage itself is enough to cause someone
to think twice about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ausman, a former managing partner at Arthur Andersen who was
chairman of the committee that brought the Super Bowl to Pasadena in
1993, was convinced of the viability of a stadium in South Park but
reluctantly stepped aside in 1996 when Ridley-Thomas asked him (and
others with stadium proposals) to abandon their projects to support
the Coliseum plans.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, after Robert McNair bowled over NFL owners by
offering a $700-million franchise fee, the league awarded the 32nd
franchise to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very disappointing because we truly believed in that
[South Park] location," Ausman said. "Had we gotten football in Los
Angeles, it would have been an accomplishment. That's all we were
after."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed site was immediately adjacent to Metro Rail's Blue
Line station on Pico, which further enhanced its accessibility and
would have cut down on traffic and parking difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Ausman said everything was in place to privately finance the
stadium by way of a football-only Real Estate Investment Trust
(REIT), a publicly held entity that pays dividends. Fans could earn
the right to buy seats at the 50-yard line by buying a certain number
of shares in the stadium. Those who bought fewer shares might be
entitled to seats on the 20. The group figured it could raise an
additional $100 million by selling personal seat licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The group estimated the cost of constructing the stadium at $350
million, of which $40 million to $50 million would be used for land
acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Some people raised questions about the feasibility of the plan,
whether the REIT would work and enough PSLs could be sold, and no one
imagined McNair would raise the ante so high by paying a franchise
fee of $700 million. (That fee, coupled with the cost of the new
stadium in Houston, means the Houston Texans have run up a bill in
excess of $1 billion.)</TE>
<TE>   Convinced as he is about the prospects of a stadium in South Park,
Ausman has no desire to be involved with any new proposals. However,
he is in favor of any project that brings the NFL back to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas wants that too. But, the way he sees it, South Park
is not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect there will be several competing sites all over again,"
he said. "Let the best site win."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Philadelphia Flyers played like a team tuning up for a playoff
run while the New York Rangers appeared to be thinking about their
golf games.</LD>
<LD>   Flyer goalie Brian Boucher stopped 25 shots and his teammates
played a smothering defensive game in front of him as the Flyers beat
the Rangers, 4-2, Wednesday night at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia moved within two points of Boston for the top spot in
the Eastern Conference. The Flyers have two games in hand on the
Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers remained three points behind Montreal and Washington,
who are tied for the eighth and final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   New York played a listless defensive game in front of rookie
goalie Dan Blackburn, who played well in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of good things in our end," Flyer Coach Bill Barber
said. "You know when your team's in trouble, and we weren't in
trouble all night long. They made some good attacks on rushes, but
they got some lucky breaks too."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead at 9:02 of the first period on Justin
Williams' 16th goal. Williams, standing just to the right of
Blackburn, accepted a pass from behind the net from Marty Murray,
then was stopped on a forehand shot before converting the rebound
with his backhand.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really happy with how I played," Blackburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "Two of the goals came on rebounds. I was feeling really good in
the net."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Nashville 1--Steve Passmore, starting consecutive games
for only the second time this season, made 16 saves for the
Blackhawks at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bell, Phil Housley, Tom Fitzgerald and Tony Amonte scored to
help the Blackhawks take sole possession of fourth place in the
Western Conference. Chicago has won two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Atlanta 2--Andrew Brunette made a triumphant return
to Atlanta with a goal and an assist.</TE>
<TE>   It was his first game at Philips Arena since the Thrashers left
him unprotected in last summer's expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   Brunette set up the first goal with a perfect cross-ice pass and
scored the game-winner after a crafty move on goalie Frederic
Cassivi.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 4, Pittsburgh 3--Bobby Holik and Patrik Elias scored
less than a minute apart to cap a three-goal, third-period comeback
at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   The loss cost the Penguins a chance to move within four points of
the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey is 7-1-0-1 in its last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, New York Islanders 1--Martin Havlat scored two goals and
had an assist and Patrick Lalime stopped 27 shots at Uniondale, N.Y.,
as the Senators won for the first time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   The Senators moved to within two points of fourth-place Toronto in
the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders have beaten Ottawa only once in their last 26
meetings (1-19-6).</TE>

<HD>Calm Camp for Nomo</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In his second stint with Dodgers, the Japanese
right-hander finds the atmosphere is far different from 1995.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Hideo Nomo was known as "the Tornado" when he burst onto the major
league scene with the Dodgers in 1995, but he has been more like a
soft breeze in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The right-hander barely caused a stir in his return to Dodgertown.
He spent quiet time at his locker reading books, no photographers
followed him into the bathroom and he jogged between practice fields
almost unnoticed by the Japanese press corps that suffocated him with
a full-court press seven years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Nomomania, the craze sparked by the pitcher's phenomenal rookie
season in 1995, has faded, the luster of that All-Star debut dulled
by the ignominy of playing for six teams in five seasons.</LD>
<TE>   The Japanese media, once relentless in pursing him, have been
dispersed, the influx of Japanese players such as Dodger left-hander
Kazuhisa Ishii and Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki deflecting the
spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who signed a two-year, $13.25-million contract with the
Dodgers in December, still draws a crowd on the days he pitches, but
he is no longer a 24/7 story in Japan. He is considered old news and
seems more like one of the guys in the Dodger clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   And he couldn't be happier.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of attention, this year compared to 1995, obviously
there's not as many things happening for me," Nomo said through an
interpreter. "At the same time, going through it then, I was somewhat
used to it from Japan. In between the lines, I was able to
concentrate on baseball. Off the field, I would say sometimes it was
disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo went 13-6 with a 2.54 earned-run average and a National
League-leading 236 strikeouts in 1995 and caused a Fernandomania-like
frenzy every time he pitched. Fans unfurled Japanese flags and
banners in stadiums around the country, and television broadcasts of
his games drew huge audiences back home.</TE>
<TE>   Though reliever Masanori Murakami played for the San Francisco
Giants in 1964-65, Nomo was the first Japanese star to play in the
major leagues, and his success electrified two countries. One
Japanese writer said Nomo was "so fantastic, so stunning, so
beautiful ... he's more famous than Sadaharu Oh." Nomo's agent, Don
Nomura, called the pitcher "the Michael Jordan of our country."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo took Dodger Stadium by storm that year ... but it was Nomo
who was under siege.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't leave his house or go to a restaurant without the
Japanese paparazzi in tow. Dodger Senior Vice President Dave Wallace,
who was the team's pitching coach in 1995, remembers photographers
hiding in the third deck of Dodger Stadium just so they could take
pictures of Nomo warming up in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   At the All-Star game in Arlington, Texas, that July, a game Nomo
started against then-Seattle ace Randy Johnson, a camera crew
followed Nomo into a bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I went through Fernandomania [with Fernando Valenzuela in 1981]
and then Nomomania," former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda said. "I think
there were more cameras and press following Nomo than there were
Fernando. I saw them taking pictures of Nomo while he was dressing,
when he went to the restroom. It was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, was how Nomo handled the pressure and attention. Though
he occasionally snapped at Japanese photographers for invading his
privacy, Nomo remained even-keeled, almost stoic, throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knew what to expect," Wallace said. "How he handled it was
most rewarding, because he was a rock through the whole thing. People
talk about guts and courage.... Had he failed, who knows what would
have happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn, who spent four years coaching
in Japan, has a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   "There would have been a lot fewer Japanese players in the game
today," he said. "Without question, Nomo paved the way. You need a
pioneer to prove that it's possible, and it takes a special type of
person to be a pioneer."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo didn't feel like a pioneer. He just wanted to get away from
the Kintetsu Buffaloes, the Japanese team that rejected a multiyear
deal for Nomo after the 1994 season. Nomo was so disenchanted with
Kintetsu that he declared his retirement from Japanese baseball at
age 26 and became a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo signed with the Dodgers, receiving a $2-million bonus, and
his overwhelming success in 1995, when he helped restore baseball's
luster after a work stoppage and the cancellation of the 1994 World
Series, helped clear a path to the U.S. for other Japanese players.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he did it was wrong; he fought against the Kintetsu
Buffaloes," said Seattle reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa, the former
Orix Blue Wave star signed by the Angels in 1997. "But what he did
here was good for all of us. Once he came here, it was a sign that
the best pitchers could pitch here.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a star in Japan, just like Ichiro. Now people look at
Shinjo [Tsuyoshi, San Francisco outfielder] and realize other
Japanese players can play here too. It all changed when Nomo came
here."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who signed a four-year, $12.2-million deal with the Dodgers
in February, said Japanese players used Nomo as a measuring stick.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Nomo coming here, I don't think a lot of Japanese players
would have known major league baseball as the supreme game in the
world," Ishii said through an interpreter. "Without him, we wouldn't
have grasped the level of play here in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo did well for three years, going 43-29 from 1995-97, but he
struggled after being struck by a Scott Rolen line drive in July
1997. He pitched in pain the rest of the season and had elbow surgery
to remove calcium deposits near his elbow that winter.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo returned in 1998, but the split-finger fastball that was so
devastating for three years seemed to desert him. When then-manager
Bill Russell told him he would be demoted to the bullpen after a 2-7,
5.05-ERA start, Nomo asked to be traded.</TE>
<TE>   Off Nomo went to the New York Mets on June 4, 1998, but by the
following spring, the Mets released him. Nomo signed with the Chicago
Cubs but was released in late April 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He caught on with Milwaukee for the rest of that season, spent
2000 in Detroit and 2001 in Boston, where he resurrected his career
with a season-opening no-hitter against Baltimore and a solid 13-10
record, 4.50 ERA and an American League-leading 220 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   He has shown signs of the old Nomo this spring, going 2-1 with a
2.37 ERA in five starts. He has snapped off many impressive
split-finger pitches, and Dodger Manager Jim Tracy believes the
return of that breaking pitch, along with an ability to throw more
first-pitch strikes, will make Nomo effective.</TE>
<TE>   He also seems like the Nomo of old; very reserved, very
workmanlike, showing little or no emotion. Don't let that fool you,
Wallace warns.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not detached at all; that's just his personality," Wallace
said. "He doesn't miss a trick. He knows exactly what's going on with
the team, in the clubhouse and on the field. He and I speak with
facial expressions."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo seems content to play a supporting role--he'll probably be
the No. 2 starter behind Kevin Brown this season--and he seems happy
to have passed the torch bearing the Japanese media's hot glare to
the younger Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be different than 1995, but I'm looking forward to it
in a different way," Nomo said. "In 1995, I was just happy to be on
the mound. This time around, I just want to go out there and win. I'm
not too concerned about what everyone else's expectations are. My
priority is winning, and if I can help the Dodgers get to the World
Series, I will be happy."</TE>

<LD>I have two daughters, one 22 and the other 25. One will be getting
married and pushed across the threshold in a Ralphs shopping cart,
and the other might already be married for all I know, but unwilling
to disclose any information about her personal life for some
ridiculous notion it could appear in the newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   Now I realize when I tell you I have two children age 22 and 25,
you're going to know just how old my wife is. I make this personal
sacrifice, however, to show you that when I'm talking to a
23-year-old Kobe Bryant, I'm looking at a young man and wondering how
my 22- or 25-year-old might fare in the same public arena.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, I can't tell you how many times I've told my 25-year-old,
"I wish you'd hurry up and make millions so I could see how we'd
handle it together."</LD>
<TE>   I don't want to say it's depressing. But the grocery store bagger
is the same age as Kobe, and if he ever makes more than minimum wage,
it will be interesting to see how he reacts.</TE>
<TE>   I TOOK out a loan to go to Staples Center the other night and
spend some time with Kobe. My other choice was to stay home and hear
what has been going on at Ralphs recently.</TE>
<TE>   As I sat there watching Kobe entertain, I got to thinking about
how much time I spend trying to help some of our local sports
figures, who aren't very good, or who think they are better than
everyone else. Just because catcher Chad Kreuter and USC Athletic
Director Mike Garrett don't talk, doesn't mean my job's done.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, though, the athletes who do everything right most of
the time around here sometimes get neglected, and the more I get the
chance to be around Kobe, the more I'm impressed by this well-rounded
young man.</TE>
<TE>   After a recent game, a mob of reporters surrounded him and he gave
every one of them what they wanted, only to find two or three waiting
for more. One wanted a tape for a cancer victim no longer able to be
at the game, and he obliged--with the kind of upbeat creative message
I'd hope my own daughter would deliver if put in the same position.</TE>
<TE>   Then a disc jockey from "Power 106" wanted to know what his
favorite movie might be ("The Godfather"), the city he hates to go to
the most (Salt Lake City) and how many zeros he might have in his
bank account (many), and I thought to myself, "my son, my son and all
those zeros."</TE>
<TE>   We're talking about an L.A. sporting treasure here for so many
years to come, and I don't know how long it took before Chicago
flipped completely for Michael Jordan, but I'm not sure we're there
yet when it comes to Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that has to do with the nitpicking that has taken place
the past few years. He was too selfish, too distant and now this year
too edgy with everyone making a big deal out of the fact he appears
to have changed.</TE>
<TE>   What a revelation that was--a 21-year-old changing as he became
22, married and then 23. I recall two years ago when my older kid
said she wanted to start paying for her own car insurance, and I just
love it when our young ones change.</TE>
<TE>   I told him I hope he continues to change, because "you really are
a terrible three-point shooter."</TE>
<TE>   I say "hello" to Kevin Brown, and I usually have to duck when he
begins throwing things around the Dodger clubhouse, but when I told
Kobe he's a terrible three-point shooter (making 27%), he said right
away, "I'm not a three-point shooter."</TE>
<TE>   I continued to tease him, of course, and said, "My daughter could
shoot better than you from three-point range," and he gave me a huge
smile and said, "Not when it counts."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't tell him my daughter is third all-time in California high
school history making three-pointers and she didn't finish her senior
season when she was on target to set the national mark. I didn't tell
Kobe she has more threes on her resume than he has in his pro career
because I got to thinking about all those zeros, how much Kobe likes
a challenge and how my daughter would just destroy him in a
three-point shootout.</TE>
<TE>   We could make such a shootout for charity--with all the proceeds
being used to pay for the grocery store bagger's wedding.</TE>
<TE>   IN SPORTS Illustrated's baseball preview issue the magazine has an
opposing team's unnamed scout size up each team. I wish I had
remained unnamed when I began writing the Page Two column--then maybe
I could have been critical of some of our local athletes instead of
having to be so delicate in what I write.</TE>
<TE>   "Eric Karros is the most putrid spring training player I've ever
seen," the unnamed scout writes in SI. "He never runs hard, and just
mails in at-bats. Yeah, he puts up OK numbers, but have some fun."</TE>
<TE>   DODGER MANAGER Jim Tracy has announced the team's starting lineup,
placing Karros seventh in the order--two spots higher than I had
projected.</TE>
<TE>   WHO HAS the best chance of rebounding--Omar Daal, Mark
Grudzielanek or Britney Spears?</TE>
<TE>   Daal is unhappy because he's in the bullpen now and he says
General Manager Dan Evans called him the third or fourth best
left-hander in the league, apparently unaware Evans has no idea what
he's saying or doing most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek is angry because he thinks he should be able to make
an out higher in the order rather than waiting until the eighth spot.</TE>
<TE>   Spears, meanwhile, got the boot from Justin Timberlake, which
tells me Timberlake and Evans have a lot in common.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Crumbles on Defense</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Strength turns into a weakness as Germany scores
three times in eight-minute span of a 4-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was only last week that Bruce Arena, coach of the U.S. national
soccer team, was praising the defensive play of the Americans in
giving up only two goals in eight games this year.</LD>
<LD>   "It has been a total team effort," Arena said. "The number of
shutouts we have [six] is a credit to the [entire] team."</LD>
<LD>   The entire team, therefore, must share the blame when the U.S.
defense crumples, as it did spectacularly Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   Germany, exploding the myth of U.S. invincibility on defense,
scored three goals in a devastating eight-minute spell in the second
half en route to a 4-2 victory in front of a sellout crowd of 28,835
at the Osteestadion in the Baltic port city of Rostock, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the key to the game was their physical strength," Arena
said. "We could have defended better and at times shown more
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "They won a lot of the battles, and in the end they were the
better team."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. was missing three potential World Cup starters:
midfielders Claudio Reyna and John O'Brien and forward Brian McBride,
all of whom were nursing injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it was a strong team Arena fielded. Or so it seemed. He
started Kasey Keller in goal; Steve Cherundolo, Eddie Pope, Jeff
Agoos and David Regis in defense; Chris Armas, Landon Donovan, Earnie
Stewart and Eddie Lewis in midfield, and Clint Mathis and Jovan
Kirovski up front.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, it appeared the Americans might give the three-time
world champions all they could handle. Coach Rudi Voeller's team,
missing no fewer than 15 players from its likely World Cup roster,
fell behind in the 17th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis took a pass from Kirovski and unleashed a shot that got
past German goalkeeper Frank Rost but hit the inside of the post.
Mathis was alert enough to pounce on the rebound and drive it into
the empty net.</TE>
<TE>   The goal woke Germany, which tied the score one minute before
halftime on a 30-yard free kick by its captain, Christian Ziege, a
teammate of Keller at Tottenham Hotspur in England.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen Ziege do this in training all the time,'' Keller said
of Ziege's shot, which sneaked into the net just inside the right
post and just beyond Keller's reach.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't cheat against him. If you move a second early, he nails
you to the other post. You basically have to give him the upper
corner. And if he hits it, you shake his hand."</TE>
<TE>   American heads were left shaking when Germany turned up the heat
in the second half. Oliver Neuville started the spree by scoring in
the 61st minute when the U.S. defense failed to clear a Bernd
Schneider corner kick.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes later, Schneider found Oliver Bierhoff with a cross
from the right and Bierhoff hammered home a shot from 10 yards for
his 33rd goal in 61 games for Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Still reeling from that blow, the U.S. gave the ball away again in
the 68th minute. Schneider fed Bierhoff, who passed the ball for
Torsten Frings to net Germany's fourth goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We let the Americans play the way they like to in the first 45
minutes, but after that we stepped up the pace and played really
well," Bierhoff said. "I think it was a pretty good performance
overall."</TE>
<TE>   Arena had sent Joe-Max Moore on in place of Kirovski an hour into
the game and it was Moore who set up Mathis for his second goal in
the 71st minute with a through pass that Mathis took in stride before
firing the ball past Hans Jorg Butt, who had replaced Rost in the
nets for Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Next up for the U.S. is a game in Denver on April 3 against
Mexico, which on Wednesday recalled former Galaxy goalkeeper Jorge
Campos to its squad for that game.</TE>

<HD>Portugal, Poland Among the Losers on a Day of Upsets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might not be much consolation for the United States, but it wasn't
the only World Cup team to be beaten on Wednesday. On a day of
upsets, nine other countries that will take part in the May 31-June
30 world championship also fell in warmup games.</LD>
<LD>   The only good news for the Americans--who lost to Germany 4-2--was
that among the losers were Portugal and Poland, two of the U.S.
teams' first-round opponents in Korea/Japan '02.</LD>
<LD>   Portugal, playing at home in Oporto but without injured midfield
standouts Luis Figo and Rui Costa, gave up three goals in the first
half en route to a lopsided and embarrassing 4-1 loss to Finland.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first home loss in 18 games for injury-plagued
Portugal, which played the last 15 minutes with 10 men because it had
no healthy substitutes left on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. opens World Cup play against Portugal in Suwon, South
Korea, on June 5.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, which will play the U.S. on June 14 in Daejeon, South
Korea, in the final first-round game, also was beaten. The Poles had
no answer for the inspired play of Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi
Nakata, who scored the first goal in a 2-0 victory in Lodz, Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese team was simply better than us," said Poland Coach
Jerzy Engel. "Our first-half performance was the worst by a Polish
team in recent times."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 26 World Cup teams played Wednesday and the most
convincing display was by world champion France, which routed
Scotland, 5-0, at the Stade de France outside Paris to ruin the debut
of Scotland's German coach Berti Vogts.</TE>
<TE>   Two first-half goals by David Trezeguet and one each by Zinedine
Zidane and Thierry Henry were enough to put the outcome beyond doubt
early on.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, which will open the World Cup against France in Seoul on
May 31, gave 50,000 of its own fans something to cheer with a 2-1
victory over Bolivia in Dakar, Senegal.</TE>
<TE>   For others, however, it was a bleak day:</TE>
<TE>   * South Africa, which last month fired Portuguese coach Carlos
Queiroz and replaced him with Jomo Sono, was buried, 4-1, by Georgia
in Tbilisi, Georgia, in a game in which two South African players
were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not too bad to give up four goals as we had to play almost
35 minutes with two men short," Sono said without much conviction.</TE>
<TE>   * Russia crashed to a 2-1 defeat against Estonia in Tallin,
Estonia, where Andres Oper scored twice for the underdog winners.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that with this kind of game we could win a single
match at the World Cup," said Mikhail Gershkovich, Russia's assistant
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Apart for a couple of players, I cannot say anything good about
the others."</TE>
<TE>   * Belgium built a 2-0 lead against Greece in Patras, Greece, only
to yield three goals in the last 31 minutes, including two in the
final 10 minutes, and lose, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   * Spain, one of the favorites to reach at least the quarterfinals
this summer, was beaten, 1-0, by the Netherlands in Rotterdam, where
veteran Frank de Boer headed in the only goal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in games pitting World Cup-bound teams against each
other:</TE>
<TE>   * Three-time world champion Italy came from behind to defeat
England, 2-1, in Leeds, England, on Vincenzo Montella's second goal
of the game off a 90th-minute penalty kick following a foul by
goalkeeper David James.</TE>
<TE>   * Cameroon, which upset then-world champion Argentina in the
opening game of the 1990 World Cup in Italy, remained undefeated
against the South Americans by twice coming from behind to earn a 2-2
tie in Geneva, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   * Saudi Arabia scored three goals in 10 minutes in the first half
and held on to defeat Uruguay, 3-2, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   * Croatia, which finished third at the France '98 World Cup, was
held to a scoreless tie by Slovenia in Zagreb, Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   * Ireland coasted to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Denmark in
Dublin, with Ian Harte, Robbie Keane and Clinton Morrison scoring the
goals.</TE>
<TE>   In other games involving World Cup teams, Sweden managed a 1-1 tie
against Switzerland in Malmo, Sweden, while Tunisia, whose French
coach, Henri Michel, quit on Monday, played to a scoreless tie
against Norway in Tunis.</TE>
<TE>   In a later game Wednesday, Brazil defeated Yugoslavia, 1-0, in
Fortaleza, Brazil, on a headed goal by Luizao in the 72nd minute, but
it was the reappearance of striker Ronaldo on the national team after
an injury-riddled 21/2 years that was the lone positive for an
otherwise dull Brazilian team.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Ecuador and Bulgaria tied, 0-0, at Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>

<HD>Serena Sets Up Sister Semifinal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Little sister takes another crack at Venus Williams today, this time
with lower stakes and less hype but lots of incentive.</LD>
<LD>   Serena Williams, who has beaten her older sister only once in six
meetings, will try again in the semifinals of the Nasdaq-100 Open.</LD>
<LD>   Their most recent showdown came in the U.S. Open in September,
when Venus won the first Grand Slam final between siblings in 117
years. From the New York spotlight the rivalry moves to the Sunshine
State, with Serena eager to beat Venus--but not desperate.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not looking for an unfair advantage," Serena said, laughing.
"We have connecting rooms, but if I see her it's not like I'll try to
bump her, or hit her, or maybe put a pillow over her in the middle of
the night."</TE>
<TE>   Serena, seeded eighth, has been the more impressive Williams en
route to the semifinals. On Wednesday, she routed two-time champion
Martina Hingis, 6-4, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   But Venus, seeded second, has won 22 consecutive matches on Key
Biscayne. She missed the 2000 tournament because of injury but won
titles in 1998, 1999 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Serena's best finish came three years ago, when she was runner-up
to Venus.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, one of us is going to be in the final again," Serena said.
"So that's a guarantee."</TE>
<TE>   Their father and coach, Richard, complained that the tournament
cheated itself by putting Venus and Serena in the same half of the
draw, preventing the sisters from meeting in the final.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Williams also suggested a new name for the WTA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the Williams Tennis Association," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to prove otherwise is No. 1-seeded Jennifer Capriati, who
earned a semifinal berth by beating Tatiana Panova, 6-2, 6-0. Tonight
Capriati will play No. 5 Monica Seles, who advanced by defeating No.
4 Kim Clijsters, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Four-time champion No. 9 Andre Agassi became the first men's
semifinalist, beating No. 20 Nicolas Lapentti, 6-3, 7-5. On Friday,
Agassi will play 1998 champion Marcelo Rios, who swept Juan Ignacio
Chela, 7-6 (0), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt needed only 10 minutes to win three
games and complete a rain-interrupted fourth-round victory over
American James Blake, 6-4, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt's opponent in the quarterfinals today will be No. 6 Marat
Safin, who beat qualifier Fernando Gonzalez, 6-3, 6-3.</TE>

<BD>FORT LAUDERDALE SUN SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>This is the day. This is the place. This is the time for Serena
Williams to stop being the little sister and start being the younger
sister.</LD>
<LD>   You do understand the distinction, don't you?</LD>
<LD>   I really don't care which sister wins this afternoon, as long as
Serena does not betray her considerable talent with another emotional
meltdown.</LD>
<TE>   I want to see her come out swinging as she has throughout the
first eight days of the Nasdaq-100 Open. I want to see her rally back
hard if she loses a set. I don't want to see her spraying balls into
Biscayne Bay down the stretch, when Venus is mentally at her
strongest.</TE>
<TE>   This seventh meeting of the Williams sisters is purely about
tennis ... finally. The carnival atmosphere of the final here in 1999
is a distant memory. Those unsubstantiated stories in the National
Enquirer about the fix being in are dead and buried.</TE>
<TE>   We will this afternoon, unfortunately, still have father Richard
holding up signs in the stands because he thinks this match is more
about him than his daughters. But the sisters can't control that.</TE>
<TE>   Their job is to compete and I think--I hope--that they are ready
to do that now against each other until the final point.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to play your brother or sister with so much at stake
in such a public way, and especially with siblings this close. During
their practices, Richard steadfastly refused to let Venus and Serena
play sets against each other.</TE>
<TE>   That kept them very close, but it also appears to have poorly
prepared Serena for the inevitability of playing her sister with
titles and prestige on the line.</TE>
<TE>   I sense, just watching her this year, that she finally has
overcome that. We'll find out today if she has learned to play the
ball, as they say in this sport, and not the opponent--even when it's
your sister.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you overcome that by being beaten down enough times. You
find out that the will to win is stronger than some misconceived
sense that you're not worthy enough to beat big sister.</TE>
<TE>   The bond between these women is too strong to be broken by a
Serena victory.</TE>
<TE>   Though Venus is the more accomplished player, the talent
difference between them is not so great that it doesn't allow for a
Serena victory.</TE>
<TE>   Venus has the greater understanding of the game and of how to
construct points. Venus hits the ball cleaner and with more
consistent power.</TE>
<TE>   But Serena is the more aggressive and when she's on, as she was
against Martina Hingis on Wednesday in the quarterfinals, she looks
unbeatable.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there has also been Serena's fragile personality against
Venus. In the 1999 Lipton final, she was right there in the third set
when she inexplicably committed a boatload of unforced errors.</TE>
<TE>   Serena came into their 2000 Wimbledon semifinal having lost only
15 games in five matches. She looked intimidated by Venus and went
down, 6-2, 7-6 (3).</TE>
<TE>   There was an important book published this week, an insider's look
at life in the Williams compound by Dave Rineberg, who was a hitting
partner for Venus and Serena from 1992-99.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years, Rineberg said Wednesday, he saw Serena's
adoration of Venus.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time Serena would get injured on court or get hurt, she would
look to Venus for comfort. Venus would put her arm around her.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that all the time. Just going into hotels, Serena would
follow Venus in, watch how she handled herself, what she did."</TE>
<TE>   It's a fascinating character contradiction that Serena, by far the
more muscular and imposing of the sisters, is not as emotionally
strong as Venus.</TE>
<TE>   "Serena always went out of her way to act tougher than she was,"
Rineberg said. "But the truth is that she was a softie. She was the
puppy dog lover."</TE>
<TE>   Rineberg is not picking Serena to win this match, even if she has
found the strength to triumph over her sister. "Venus to win. I've
got no hesitation in saying that," Rineberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the way Venus controls the court. She hits a ball that is
more penetrating. Serena has weapons, but I still think that older
sister thing is going to work."</TE>
<TE>   Even one match point for Serena would send up a flare that a new
day is here.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't just be good for Serena to take command of her
emotions today. It would be awfully good for tennis too.</TE>

<HD>Decision Time at Long Beach</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach State is expected to select a new men's basketball coach
by Friday and it will be either Larry Reynolds or Mike Dunlap, each a
coach of a highly successful Division II program.</LD>
<LD>   A source said a news conference will take place Friday morning.
Long Beach sports information director Steve Janisch said that
information is incorrect.</LD>
<LD>   "The search committee has not made its recommendation to [Athletic
Director] Bill Shumard," Janisch said. "No offer is going to be made
before then."</LD>
<TE>   Reynolds, who is 110-35 in five seasons at Cal State San
Bernardino, interviewed with Shumard on Saturday and Dunlap
interviewed Tuesday and Wednesday for the position vacated by Wayne
Morgan, who resigned in March after six seasons. Dunlap led Metro
State (Colo.) to the Division II title last week.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, 48, led San Bernardino to a 28-2 record this season and
a berth in the Elite Eight tournament. He also interviewed at Boise
State on Monday but said he withdrew his name Wednesday morning.
Boise State hired Oregon assistant Greg Graham later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Long Beach State is a very attractive position and the timing of
the Boise State position was a little conflicting," Reynolds said.
"They wanted to move a little quickly. I owed it to myself to wait a
little."</TE>
<TE>   Shumard has said he would like to hire a coach by the end of this
week or next week after the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt my interview went well," said Reynolds, who said he will
attend the Final Four in Atlanta. "I think Long Beach State offers
the ingredients necessary to be successful in [the Big West]
conference."</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap, 44, has also come up in consideration for openings at
Fresno State and New Mexico. His Metro State team defeated San
Bernardino, 65-48, in the NCAA quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap, a former USC assistant who is 138-28 with two national
titles in five seasons at Metro State, was to return to Denver on
Wednesday night and was unavailable for comment. Metro State Athletic
Director Joan McDermott said she has anticipated losing Dunlap since
he turned down the Loyola Marymount job two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "His dream has always been to be a Division I coach," McDermott
said. "I've always encouraged him to look at those opportunities. I
know that he's very intrigued with Long Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Utah assistant Dick Hunsaker had also expressed interest but was
not interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Forgive Blythe Hartley if she feels a little rundown. The last six
days have been a whirlwind for the USC freshman diver.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley became the first woman in NCAA history to win titles in
the one-meter springboard and platform events in the same
championships. She performed the feats last Thursday and Saturday at
the Jamail Texas Swim Center in Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley wasn't home long. She was honored Tuesday night at the
Canadian Sport Awards in Toronto. She was one of three finalists for
junior female athlete of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really busy," Hartley, a Vancouver native, said Monday
before leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley was nominated for her winning effort at the 2001 World
Diving Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. The 19-year-old won the
one-meter springboard in what she called "a big shock."</TE>
<TE>   Hartley won her first senior national title at 14. She competed
for Canada in the Sydney Olympics, finishing third in the three-meter
synchro event and 10th in the three-meter springboard.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley's transition to collegiate diving is a work in progress.
She has had to deal with a more condensed scheduled, competing in
meets almost weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy and excited because it's been such an adjustment
this year and the fact that I can make that adjustment and be
successful is a good thing," Hartley said.</TE>
<TE>   In a nonconference weekend series that didn't affect the Big West
Conference standings, Cal State Fullerton swept Long Beach State in a
three-game series at Fullerton's Goodwin Field. Fullerton (16-9),
which moved up a spot to No. 14 in the Baseball America poll, shut
out the 18th-ranked 49ers (15-9) for the first time in 15 years as
pitcher Wes Littleton earned a 6-0 victory Friday. Shane Costa's
two-run single helped the Titans come back for a 7-6 victory
Saturday. On Sunday, they dealt Long Beach starter Abe Alvarez his
first loss in seven decisions, 8-7.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the first time this season on its home field didn't
help USC as the Trojans dropped all three games to top-ranked
Stanford. The Trojans (12-13) either played on the road or at Dodger
Stadium while Dedeaux Field was undergoing a $4-million
renovation.... Bill Murphy struck out 14 Oregon State batters and
pitched a complete game to give Cal State Northridge a 4-3 victory
Friday. The Matadors (18-9) took two of three in Corvallis.... UC
Riverside (15-11) is playing in the Hawaii tournament this week....
UC Irvine (17-13) opens Big West play Friday with a three-game
weekend series at Pacific.... Cory Brightwell had a career-high four
hits and five runs batted in in Pepperdine's 11-9 victory Sunday at
St. Mary's. The Waves are 12-16.... Irvine freshman Walailak Satarak
shot a final-round 72 Sunday to win the 36-hole Mountain View
Collegiate tournament at Tucson. Satarak won by two strokes.</TE>

<LD>A final look at the top 10 girls' water polo teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Foothill (27-2, SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   The Knights won their third consecutive Southern Section Division
I title with an 8-0 victory over Santa Margarita, the only team to
defeat Foothill in the pool this season. The Knights' other loss came
via forfeit.</LD>
<TE>   2. Santa Margarita (25-4, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles were at their best in a 7-6 victory over Foothill at
the Irvine Southern California Invitational, but at their worst while
being shut out by the same team in the Division I final.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bell Gardens (33-1, SS-Div. III)</TE>
<TE>   Patty Cardenas and Alex Lopez went 124-2 at Bell Gardens during
their careers, which culminated with a fourth consecutive Division
III title. Their loss this season came against El Toro in a
quarterfinal of the Southern California Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   4. Corona del Mar (25-7, SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Kings won the Division IV title with an 11-6 victory over
Placentia El Dorado. Corona del Mar also reached the final of the
Southern California Invitational, losing to Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   5. Newport Harbor (23-7, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors had to face some tough obstacles this season, losing
to eventual champion Santa Margarita in a quarterfinal of the
Southern California Invitational and to eventual champion Foothill in
a semifinal of the Division I playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   6. Long Beach Wilson (17-10, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins got typically hot in the postseason, knocking off Villa
Park and El Toro before being stopped by Santa Margarita, 8-3, in a
Division I semifinal. Wilson also had a key victory over Santa
Barbara in the Southern California Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   7. Santa Barbara (25-6, SS-Div. II)</TE>
<TE>   The Dons ended their season on a high note, winning their fourth
Division II title in the last five seasons with a strong defensive
effort in a 9-1 victory over Channel League rival Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   8. El Toro (20-9, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers didn't measure up to the expectations placed on them
after U.S. junior national player Lauren Heineck transferred in, but
they did advance to the semifinals of the Southern California
Invitational by upsetting Bell Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   9. Arlington (24-7, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   Arlington won its second consecutive Division V title with an 8-5
victory over Ivy League rival Riverside North. Arlington also won the
consolation championship at the Santa Barbara Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   10. Riverside North (22-7, SS-Div. V)</TE>
<TE>   North played as well as any runner-up at the Southern Section
finals, staying even with Arlington until being outscored, 3-0, in
the third quarter.</TE>

<DH>On a Team of Stars, Maryland Sophomore Chris Wilcox Is
Making Name for Himself</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was cut from his seventh-grade team, didn't join the Maryland
lineup until midway through this season and, in a bar bet, might be
the only Terrapin starter you can't name.</LD>
<LD>   Baxter, Dixon, Blake, Mouton and ... ?</LD>
<LD>   At last weekend's East Regional finals, though, Maryland sophomore
forward Chris Wilcox shared the floor with three or four future NBA
stars and might have more upside than any of them. It took only a few
runs up and down the court to imagine Wilcox running with the
(Chicago) Bulls.</LD>
<TE>   He arrived late to an already great ensemble, like Ringo to the
Beatles, yet Wilcox must continue providing the critical backbeat if
Maryland is to prevail at this weekend's Fab Four convention in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox represents the "kid" component in a Maryland lineup that
features three savvy seniors--Lonny Baxter, Juan Dixon, Byron
Mouton--and a junior guard, Steve Blake, who will be making his 103rd
start Saturday when the Terrapins take on Kansas in the second
national semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox won't be hard to spot; he'll be the guy wearing goose
bumps.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, who averaged only 8.6 minutes a game as a freshman, had
about as much to do with last year's Final Four run as the Terrapin
towel boy.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't a key player," Wilcox said. "Last year, I was like a
last option."</TE>
<TE>   As he sat behind an all-star cast, Wilcox wondered if he made a
mistake when he wandered north out of Whiteville, N.C., to attend
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   After all, aren't incoming star freshmen supposed to call their
own shots?</TE>
<TE>   "I would call home and say, 'Mom, I want to leave,'" Wilcox said.
"I never really meant it, but I always said it. The next day I'd have
a great practice and I'd say, 'nah.'"</TE>
<TE>   Different story this season, as Wilcox inherited the power forward
position from Terence Morris, a much-touted player who never quite
lived up to his hype.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox has exceeded expectations. He has been an adrenaline
injection into a squad that is so well oiled it sometimes takes on
the collective look of a bunch of guys watching clothes dry at a
Laundromat.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, a 6-foot-10 player with silky smooth skills and a flair
for the dramatic, might be the tomahawk-jam jolt needed to push
Maryland to the national title.</TE>
<TE>   "I bring a lot of excitement to the team, a lot of energy," he
said. "I play hard and do the little things. I think that's why my
teammates like me and I earned a starting spot."</TE>
<TE>   The basketball nuts and bolts of it?</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox is such an athletic load at power forward that opposing
defenses cannot simply gang up on center Baxter. Wilcox is one of the
reasons Baxter was able to score 29 points against Connecticut in
last Sunday's East Regional final.</TE>
<TE>   Players who insist on double-teaming Baxter are often left looking
up at Wilcox in a slam-dunk picture pose.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox scored 13 points in 25 minutes in the victory over
Connecticut. For the season, he averages 12 points and seven
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is one of those special people," Maryland Coach Gary
Williams said. "He can do some things. But he really had to learn how
to play basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox has been a quick study, and Williams isn't blowing smoke
when he says his sophomore "got a chance to be one of the best
players to play at Maryland."</TE>
<TE>   This is significant praise when you consider Len Bias, Joe Smith
and Steve Francis were all terrific Terrapins.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox can only laugh when mentioned in this light.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he couldn't crack the starting lineup at Chadbourn Middle
School in Whiteville.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there's probably a lot of players that got cut their first
time, but it was tough," Wilcox said. "The next day, they post your
name up there in school, right there. They post it on the board and
your name ain't on there, and you're like, 'What happened? What
happened?'"</TE>
<TE>   What happened was Cathy Barnett, the Chadbourn coach, didn't deem
Wilcox worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox's mother and godmother tried to buck up the kid through
this mini-crisis. They told Chris the now-famous story of another
player from North Carolina who turned out OK after getting cut from
his high school basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   "My god mom always told me, 'You remember Michael Jordan got cut?'
and I'd say, 'But Mom, I'm not Michael Jordan.'"</TE>
<TE>   It was incredible Wilcox didn't make the team, considering that at
6-2, he was taller than anyone in the student body and most of the
school's administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "I say I wouldn't have cut me," Wilcox joked, "but I don't know. I
was 6-2 at the time but I couldn't jump, I couldn't do a lot of
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from peers was predictable.</TE>
<TE>   "'Oh, he got cut, he's sorry,' that's what people said."</TE>
<TE>   For a lot of uncoordinated kids, this would have been end of
story. For Wilcox, it was the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked on my game every day," he said. "I would leave home
early in the morning and I wouldn't come home until late at night."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox made Barnett's eighth-grade team.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said Barnett died a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish she was still alive so she could see where I'm at now," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It has been quite a ride. Wilcox played his freshman year at West
Columbus High, then transferred to Whiteville for his next two years,
leading the team to the state finals as a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox dreamed of attending North Carolina, but he was struggling
with his grades. While the Tar Heels' interest waned, Maryland and
North Carolina State kept close watch on Wilcox's academic progress.</TE>
<TE>   In part to upgrade his learning environment, Wilcox transferred to
Enloe High in Raleigh for his senior year. His mom, Deborah Brown,
helped her son study for the SAT by making him pick a word out of the
dictionary every day and use it during the day in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Wilcox was summoned to see the assistant principal.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was in trouble," Wilcox said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the news was good. Wilcox had passed his SAT.</TE>
<TE>   "She had tears in her eyes she was so happy for me," Wilcox says.
"That was such a great feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland coaches were on the horn as soon as they heard Wilcox had
made the grade.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox isn't at the top of his game yet, but is climbing fast. It
didn't hurt that he had his "coming-out" game this year against Duke,
finishing with 23 points and 11 rebounds in the Feb. 17 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, not surprisingly, is a hot topic on NBA Internet sites. He
probably would be a first-round pick if he declared for the draft.
NBAdraft.net has projected Wilcox as the No. 7 prospect and remarks,
"it's obvious that he is the most talented player at Maryland."</TE>
<TE>   Matthew J. Mauer of the NBA Draft Report says Wilcox is "a
superstar athlete who is just starting to scratch the surface of his
game. He can rebound, block shots and runs the floor faster than most
guards."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Chicago Tribune survey of NBA scouts and officials
projected Wilcox as the No. 15 pick, sandwiched between Gonzaga guard
Dan Dickau at No. 14 and No. 16 Carlos Boozer of Duke. Times NBA
writer Mark Heisler ranked Wilcox as the 11th best prospect two weeks
ago.</TE>
<TE>   This is all fascinating and flattering. But, as of now, Wilcox
says he is returning for his junior season at Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things I've got to work on," he says.
"Hopefully I can work on them over the summer and prepare myself and
do great next year. I'm not planning on going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Next year, Wilcox would make the leap from support player to
superstar. He would also be able to put to test all he has learned.</TE>
<TE>   "Just playing with Juan Dixon and Lonny Baxter, they did a great
job of helping prepare me," Wilcox says. "They pushed me every day in
practice and made me work harder. I thank them for that."</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>There is a common thread binding the Final Four teams gearing up to
decide the 2002 NCAA champion in women's basketball.</LD>
<LD>   All of the teams--Connecticut, Duke, Oklahoma and Tennessee--are
here because of outstanding guard play.</LD>
<LD>   Mideast Region champion Connecticut (37-0) has a devastating duo
in senior Sue Bird, the national player of the year, and sophomore
Diana Taurasi, who can drive to the basket and shoot the three-point
shot with equal aplomb.</LD>
<TE>   Midwest Region champion Tennessee (29-4) is led by senior captain
Kara Lawson, who is the extension of Coach Pat Summitt's will and
intensity on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   East Region champion Duke (31-3) has its own brilliant sophomore
in Alana Beard, whose combination of speed, vision and athleticism
makes her as much a nightmare to defend as Taurasi.</TE>
<TE>   West Region champion Oklahoma (31-3) has arguably the most
experienced, savvy tandem in seniors Stacey Dales and LaNeishea
Caufield.</TE>
<TE>   So figure that the champion will come from the team whose
backcourt has the best weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut, which plays Tennessee in one semifinal, is the heavy
favorite. Only one team (Virginia Tech) has stayed within nine points
of the Huskies, who overran Oklahoma and Tennessee in the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   The starting lineup of Bird, Taurasi, and forwards Swin Cash,
Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams has led Connecticut to a
school-record for wins and its third consecutive Final Four. Two more
victories and Connecticut will not only tie Tennessee's NCAA standard
of 39 regular-season victories, but lay claim to being the best team
ever.</TE>
<TE>   As dangerous as Taurasi can be, Tennessee must first stop Bird. A
14.4-points-a-game scorer during the regular season, she went wild in
regional wins over Penn State and Old Dominion with 24 and 26 points,
respectively. She also had 11 assists against Old Dominion.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's fitting the Lady Vols have the first opportunity to
stop the Huskies' encroachment on their historical turf. Even though
Tennessee was outclassed by Connecticut in an 86-72 loss on its home
court in January, Summitt--who has six national championships and 780
wins--knows a thing or two about preparing teams for highly
pressurized situations.</TE>
<TE>   Summitt will need Lawson to rediscover her offense. Lawson stirred
Tennessee's defensive effort in wins over Brigham Young and
Vanderbilt. But she had only five points in each game. That's not
enough from someone used to getting 15 points a night.</TE>
<TE>   Duke, whose 22-game winning streak is the second longest in the
nation after Connecticut's, is the youngest team in the tournament
(only one senior).</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies, Lady Vols and Sooners can handle it if their top
guards have an off game, but the Blue Devils cannot afford a bad
night from Beard. So far she hasn't been bad, the 24 points and seven
assists in the regional final against South Carolina being typical of
the kind of tournament she is enjoying.</TE>
<TE>   Caufield and Dales work extremely well together.</TE>
<TE>   Caufield, who scored 18 and 25 in the Sooners' wins over Texas
Tech and Colorado, knows Dales needs just a sliver of space to pass
her the ball for easy scores, either on a fastbreak or in the
halfcourt game.</TE>
<TE>   Caufield has been looking for her shot all tournament; if she
makes a couple of baskets early she becomes a huge defensive problem.
If she misses early she can become discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   Dales, who had 15 and 20 points in the two games, will produce
points if needed and can be a three-point threat.</TE>
<TE>   But Dales is most dangerous when she is directing the offense,
either from the top of the key or inside the lane. Whoever defends
her has to deny Dales the ball as much as possible. That will slow
Oklahoma down to a walk.</TE>

<HD>An American Dream Is Crushed by Violence</HD>
<DH>Kidnapping: Russian businessman fell in love with Los
Angeles and came to make films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the afternoon of Jan. 23, three days after his apparent abduction
by a local kidnapping ring, George Safiev phoned his Beverly
Hills-area estate and told the nanny to put his 4-year-old son,
Denis, on the line.</LD>
<LD>   "They spoke for a long time, as if they both knew they were
talking for the last time to each other," said the nanny, Alina
Prokofyeva. "[Denis] said, 'Daddy, why don't you come home? You have
been away so long. Please come back.'"</LD>
<LD>   Nearly two months later, long after the phone had stopped ringing
and hope had started to fade, the family learned that Safiev, a
Russian banking mogul, would never be coming back. Last week, his
body and those of three other Russian immigrants, including his
partner in a fledgling film company, were pulled from New Melones
Lake in California's gold country. A fifth body had been found in the
same waters in October.</LD>
<TE>   Today, two men are in federal custody on charges of kidnapping
Safiev, 37. They and two others are also charged with kidnapping or
aiding and abetting the abduction of Alexander Umansky, 35. Another
two men are being held on charges of handling ransom payments. All
the suspects have Eastern European roots.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said more charges are likely in the five
deaths, and another suspect is being sought.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests have done little to ease the pain of the victims'
relatives. Their ordeals began with a loved one who did not come home
one night. The families made frantic calls--to friends of the
missing, to co-workers and finally to the police. Nothing. Then, in
some cases, calls came from the missing themselves, reassuring at
first, but desperate in the end.</TE>
<TE>   For the Safievs, things began to go wrong Jan. 20, the night of
the 59th annual Golden Globe Awards. By some accounts, Safiev and
Nick Kharabadze, 29, had planned to hit the post-awards parties.
Instead, the two partners in Matador Media disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Safiev called Prokofyeva, who was watching Denis
while his wife, Svetlana, and 17-year-old daughter, Evgenia,
vacationed in Moscow. He told the nanny not to worry, not to call
anyone, that he and Kharabadze encountered a minor problem. He hinted
that the younger man had been jailed for drunk driving, Prokofyeva
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, Safiev's Mercedes turned up in Burbank. He
called Svetlana and Evgenia four times.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the same thing in all the calls," Svetlana said in a
heavy Russian accent. "'Someone is standing next to me. I can't
talk.... But don't worry please. I'll sort everything out and meet
you on Saturday at the airport.'"</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Svetlana asked her husband whether he was in trouble
with the police.</TE>
<TE>   "I said ... 'Maybe something is wrong with your car,'" she said.
"He said yes, yes--just to make me quiet."</TE>
<TE>   The Safievs have moved back to Moscow, where George Safiev had
bodyguards. Svetlana and her daughter are in California this week to
perform the grim task of identifying Safiev's body.</TE>
<TE>   They don't know what they are going to do about the
multimillion-dollar house on a ridge top above Beverly Hills, where
Denis' swing set sits empty in the backyard. There is also the swank
Santa Monica office of Matador, the desks piled with notes on movies
never made.</TE>
<TE>   "Here ... he believed it was safe," Evgenia said of her father.
"He couldn't believe you would need bodyguards."</TE>
<TE>   "He brought his dreams here," Svetlana added. "And such a disaster
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing stylish clothes but looking tired, they slumped in chairs
in the Colorado Boulevard office, thumbing through pictures of him
that Svetlana carries in her white leather purse. There were shots
from Mexico, Russia and Los Angeles. In each, Safiev wears an impish
grin, his arm around family members or friends.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev's mother lives in Moscow and has cancer. Svetlana kept the
news of his death from her for a week, afraid that it would kill her.</TE>
<TE>   But Svetlana herself is determined to view his body, to see for
herself what had happened to the man she met when both were
teen-agers.</TE>
<TE>   "Before I see it, I won't believe he is dead," Svetlana said. "For
us, he is alive. I feel him every moment."</TE>
<TE>   Last June, the Safievs arrived in Los Angeles in style. They moved
into a gleaming contemporary home in a gated community off Mulholland
Drive, with views from the ocean to the San Fernando Valley. A white
stone lion guards the driveway. Out back, the swimming pool reflects
the palm trees swaying in the breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Children Relish New Life in America</TE>
<TE>   Evgenia and Denis adapted joyfully to this new world. Denis was
his father's constant companion, coasting down Mulholland with him to
the beach, joining him on skiing vacations. Evgenia took a
broadcasting course at a community college.</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana, however, had a different reaction to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt something wrong inside of me," she said as she looked
around the Matador office--at the stacks of paper, and the two
workers wondering what to do with them. "My spirit refused. I don't
know why. All the time, I felt wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Matador had started up only last May. But Safiev and Kharabadze
had spent the last year or so making waves in Tinseltown. Safiev
schmoozed at Sundance, Kharabadze sipped cocktails at Shutters on the
Beach, and both did lunch with established players.</TE>
<TE>   With Safiev as the money guy and winsome Kharabadze as the
Hollywood connection, they planned to produce "Manslaughter," a
psychological thriller with roots in a true story, and "Amphibian
Man," a horror film based on a Soviet-era classic.</TE>
<TE>   For Safiev, Hollywood was a long way from the cold and sometimes
brutal homeland where he amassed his fortune, which authorities say
is in bank accounts around the world. His family says they knew
little about his business dealings, but that he fought for that
fortune with the same fervor that had made him a boxing champion in
his youth.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev had originally dreamed of becoming a pilot, but his
colorblindness disqualified him for a license. He found a new focus
in the free markets emerging from the crumbling Soviet system.</TE>
<TE>   While studying engineering at the University of Kiev, he met
Svetlana at a dance. They were married in 1983. Neither had much
money, Svetlana said. Evgenia was born in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The young father took a variety of odd jobs, from cook to cleaning
man. When the Kremlin loosened its rules on entrepreneurship in the
mid-1980s, he threw his efforts into a small computer start-up. From
there, he went into banking, Svetlana said. She said she could
provide no further details.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a self-made man," she said. "He didn't have any enemies.
He had lots of friends."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter said Safiev "was not only someone who loved life, but
he taught us how to get pleasure from every single moment. Sometimes,
he had so many problems, but he would come home and make his family
feel so loved."</TE>
<TE>   Safiev also loved the movies, she said. Prokofyeva said he had
crafted a film treatment based on the life of Hadji Murad, a famed
19th century Chechen warrior who had been the subject of a Tolstoy
novella.</TE>
<TE>   With his daughter, Safiev flew to Los Angeles for a vacation about
18 months ago, and fell in love again. For a man who spent part of
his youth in the Siberian town of Norilsk--a frozen and polluted
mining center above the Arctic Circle--L.A. was a wonderland.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside, he is very artistic," Svetlana said, a small smile
creeping across her face. "He was tired of all the business [in
Russia]. He loved L.A. and the people here."</TE>
<TE>   He bought in-line skates to ride along Santa Monica Beach. He was
a health nut, doing yoga every day and extolling organic foods to
anyone who would listen.</TE>
<TE>   What might have been the first sign of trouble came Dec. 5, though
the Safievs say they didn't realize it then. That day, Matador's
accountant Rita Pekler disappeared. Pekler only did occasional work
for Matador, so no one in the office knew she was missing until a few
weeks later. When Safiev found out, he didn't think it had anything
to do with him, said Matador office manager Olga Preiss.</TE>
<TE>   Pekler's body was pulled from the lake last week, along with those
of Safiev, Kharabadze and Umansky, a North Hollywood businessman. In
October, Meyer Muscatel, 58, a Sherman Oaks real estate developer,
had been found dead in the lake, with his hands bound and a bag over
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks after Pekler's disappearance, Safiev, Denis and
Prokofyeva spent a Sunday morning at Santa Monica Beach. In the
afternoon, they headed back to Beverly Hills so Prokofyeva could
prepare dinner for Kharabadze and another Safiev friend, Gary
Paronyan.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was a change in plans. Safiev announced that he and
Kharabadze would eat at Paronyan's house. Prokofyeva said she never
saw him again.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the calls from Safiev began. One of them went to
his business manager, instructing him to transfer $1 million from
Moscow to an account in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Victim Assured Family Until the End</TE>
<TE>   Svetlana and Evgenia said they last heard from him on the same day
he had the long talk with Denis.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry please," he said, according to Svetlana. "I'll sort
everything out." And they agreed to meet at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Mother and daughter flew into LAX three days later, but Safiev was
not there to greet them.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two months, Svetlana said, she was in constant contact
with the FBI, despairing at the lack of progress.</TE>
<TE>   Finally there was news from Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "These are horrible people, like animals," Svetlana said. "Even
now, we don't believe it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Troops Sliding Into Mission to Keep Peace</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Escalating armed conflict between Afghan factions is drawing the
U.S. military deeper into the peacekeeping role that the Bush
administration has long vowed to avoid.</LD>
<LD>   From the beginning of the war, President Bush has declared that U.S.
troops were in Afghanistan on a short-term assignment to root out
terrorism and would not act as constables or "nation-builders." But as
factional tensions have sharpened, U.S. troops have intervened repeatedly
to prevent fighting or to halt it once it started.</LD>
<LD>   Air Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said in an interview this week that U.S. Army Special Forces
soldiers had already taken action in more than 10 incidents to "keep
peace within the family."</LD>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether U.S. troops would be inserted into any
major inter-Afghan battles that risked sizable American casualties. Yet
U.S. officials concede that mediating conflicts between rival warlords or
groups is now one of the many roles the troops have taken on to help
ensure security as Afghanistan seeks to end decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll continue to use our Special Forces and civil affairs teams with
local commanders on the ground to try to deal with contentious issues and
to discourage conflict among them," State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of allied countries and private Western groups in
Afghanistan say they believe that, like it or not, the U.S. troops have
become the security force of last resort.</TE>
<TE>   "In effect, they will be the peacekeepers," said a senior Western
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Why not admit it?"</TE>
<TE>   The expansion of the U.S. troops' role raises new questions about how
long they will be tied up in Afghanistan and whether the commitment could
interfere with possible plans for a military campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials intend to turn over the job of ensuring security to the
Afghan army, which the Americans have begun to train. But by the U.S.
military's own estimates, it may be two years before that army is capable
of quelling fights between Afghanistan's quarrelsome factions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. officials say they believe that the presence of about
5,000 heavily armed American troops in Afghanistan is helping to deter
fighting. But in some cases, warlords have taken up arms, and U.S. troops
have had to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the International Crisis
Group, a Brussels-based think tank that has been active in Afghanistan,
said the United States "will be the default security guarantor, at least
in the interim," until a national army is established.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that this period of U.S. obligation "will get longer and
longer," despite Washington's intentions of turning the job over to the
Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   The internal armed conflicts have been concentrated in northern
Afghanistan, near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, and in the east, near
Jalalabad, U.S. officials and private experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Few details of the U.S. military's role in these incidents were
available. But in February, U.S. troops intervened between two rival
forces who were fighting south of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   As an interim government has struggled to extend its authority outside
the capital, Kabul, these tribal leaders and other militia commanders
have tried to maintain their influence over key sections of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Also threatening peace is friction between Pushtuns, the largest
ethnic group in Afghanistan, and other groups. Violence in the north has
been driving Pushtuns toward the southern part of the country, which they
dominate.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. role in keeping the peace has become clearer in recent days,
as allied officials have rejected the idea of broadening the
international peacekeeping force that is now patrolling Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Though some Bush administration officials favored the idea of
expanding the international force to other cities, others feared that the
U.S. obligation to help protect such a force could interfere with the
primary mission of destroying the remnants of Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have committed themselves to helping out the existing
international force if it comes under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his aides have stressed since his 2000 presidential campaign
that they do not believe that U.S. combat troops should be posted to keep
the peace in missions such as the one that the Clinton administration
began in the Balkans in 1995. They have argued that combat troops are
poorly suited for such a role and that local forces, or other countries,
should take on such tasks.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue is especially difficult in Afghanistan, since the United
States does not want to risk another collapse that would allow the
country to become a haven for Islamic militants intent on destroying
America.</TE>
<TE>   Gary J. Schmitt, executive director of the pro-defense group Project
for a New American Century, said he believes that if civil upheaval
threatened the new order in Afghanistan, the Bush administration would
decide that it had to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   Completely pulling out of Afghanistan instead would not only allow the
Al Qaeda terrorist network to reestablish itself, but would also send a
signal that the United States doesn't care about the region's long-term
stability, he said. Such a move would raise doubts among Arab countries
that are being courted as U.S. allies against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein but worry that his ouster would trigger instability beyond Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Attack in Israel Kills 19, Hurts 100</HD>
<DH>Violence: Palestinian suicide bombing, the deadliest in 10 months,
could end efforts for a cease-fire and unleash a new phase in the
conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>On one of Judaism's holiest nights, a Palestinian carrying a
suitcase of explosives blew himself up Wednesday inside a hotel dining
hall packed with families gathering to share the Passover Seder.</LD>
<LD>   At least 19 people were killed, including the bomber, and more than
100 were injured in the attack in the coastal city of Netanya. The
bombing was the deadliest suicide attack in Israel in 10 months and one
that will have far-reaching consequences for Israel's conflict with the
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   The carnage could demolish U.S. efforts to broker a cease-fire and
could unleash a new phase in a conflict that has already claimed more
than 1,500 lives in 18 months. More than military retaliation, Israel is
considering launching another massive campaign of incursions and raids
across the West Bank and Gaza Strip, army officers said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not just terror," Public Security Minister Uzi Landau said.
"This is a massacre."</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead, dying and wounded in Wednesday's Passover bombing were
entire families, Israelis and foreign Jews visiting for the holiday. The
force of the ferocious blast devastated the dining hall, knocked down the
facade of the hotel lobby, shredded the paneled ceiling inside and
crumpled cars parked on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Blood-spattered victims staggered in a daze from the stricken Park
Hotel on Netanya's boardwalk. The dead were lined up in body bags on the
asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals were overwhelmed, setting up triage in their synagogues and
shuffling the less seriously wounded to their cafeterias. As is usually
the case, the bomb contained nails and other metal pieces to boost its
lethal impact.</TE>
<TE>   The radical Islamic organization Hamas claimed responsibility for the
blast. But Israel blamed Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
and said he will pay the price.</TE>
<TE>   Landau said it was time to destroy or disarm all Palestinian security
forces, many of which Israel accuses of engaging in terrorism. "We should
go back into the territories to ensure that the [Israeli army] remains
the only armed force," he said. "Not just go in and out--we must go in
and stay in until the job is done."</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, at his Negev desert ranch for the
holiday, held urgent consultations with his security chiefs and will
"reconsider Israel's overall policy" of relative restraint in recent
weeks, spokesman Raanan Gissin said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat condemned the attack, saying it was aimed at undermining both
the Arab League summit underway in Beirut and the truce-seeking mission
of U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni. Arafat vowed to arrest those
responsible, although his previous promises have gone unfulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Both Arafat and Sharon were reported to have spoken by phone with
Zinni, whose mission was already virtually paralyzed by difficulties in
bringing the two sides any closer to accepting a CIA-drafted truce plan.</TE>
<TE>   After the bombing, President Bush once again called on Arafat to do
all in his power to stop the escalating cycle of bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "This callous, this coldblooded killing must stop. I condemn it in the
strongest terms. I call upon Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do
everything in their power to stop the terrorist killing, because there
are people in the Middle East who would rather kill than have peace,"
Bush said during a stop in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the bloodshed
by extremists hurts the Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   "This sort of activity and the tolerance of this sort of activity will
destroy the very vision that the Palestinian Authority stands for and
Chairman Arafat says he is committed to," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell formally labeled an Arafat-linked militia a terrorist
organization Wednesday. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a branch of Arafat's
Fatah organization, last week claimed responsibility for a suicide
bombing at a Jerusalem shopping mall that killed three Israelis and
injured more than 60.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's bomber, identified by Hamas as Abdel-Basset Odeh, 23, of
the West Bank town of Tulkarm, timed his entry into the hotel lobby to
the hour that about 250 people were arriving from synagogue prayers and
sitting down to the traditional meal that opens the eight-day Passover
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Odeh, wearing a black coat and possibly a wig, quickly aroused the
suspicions of the Landerlok family visiting from Sweden. He entered the
dining hall, the Landerloks told reporters, and pretended to look for a
table in the lower level where the Seder was taking place. He was the
only single man among a sea of families.</TE>
<TE>   "We were about to sit down when my father saw him and told me, 'Come
here, there is something strange about that man over there,' " said Yoel
Landerlok, 20, a yeshiva student who was attending the Seder with his
parents and two younger siblings. "When he was three tables from us,
there was a terrible explosion. Everyone was thrown to the ground. A huge
hole opened in the wall near us."</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed his brother and sister and ran. Only later, in Netanya's
crowded, frantic Laniado Hospital, were the children reunited with their
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Across Israel, families starting their Seder reading of the Haggadah,
about the delivery of the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt to the
Promised Land, were instead tuning in to television news reports,
horrifically familiar in their chaotic detail of blaring sirens, flashing
lights and rescue workers picking up the dead.</TE>
<TE>   For all its military might, Israel has not been able to stop suicide
bombers. Polls show that Palestinians--besieged by Israeli military
blockades and aerial bombardments--give ample support for attacks against
Israelis. Arafat exercises only nominal control over the most extreme
elements of his people, many of whom believe that suicide bombings are
starting to have the desired effect by exacting a painful price on
Israeli society, its economy and its spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Israeli people cannot take this indefinitely," senior
Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh said Wednesday in Gaza. "Anyone reading the
Israeli newspapers can see their suffering. They love life more than any
other people, and they prefer not to die."</TE>
<TE>   Across the West Bank and Gaza Strip this week, street demonstrations
have demanded that Arab leaders meeting in Beirut deliver more weapons,
not peace.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Passover massacre, Sharon--his standing in the polls
at a new low--was being pulled harder to the right, closer to his own
natural instincts, by the hawks and hard-liners who dominate his
government. They are increasingly demanding tougher, more decisive
action--a large-scale military operation that will crush Palestinian
resistance once and for all, and quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon convened his security Cabinet this week to go over the plans
for the next phase of the conflict, which aides said the prime minister
had expected would become necessary because of the likelihood that both
the Arab summit and Palestinian cease-fire negotiations would fail.</TE>
<TE>   Gissin, Sharon's spokesman, said the government had informed
Washington when Zinni arrived this month that "if we face a major attack
like this one, we reserve the right to take military action."</TE>
<TE>   Any future Israeli action is most likely to be a reprise of the
offensive that Israel launched Feb. 28, the largest military operation
staged by the Israeli army in the West Bank and Gaza since capturing
those territories in the 1967 Middle East War. Israel sent 20,000 troops
to invade Palestinian cities, raid refugee camps, round up hundreds of
men and confiscate weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The next reoccupation would probably go deeper and last longer. A
senior security official, speaking earlier this week, said the operations
in the first two weeks of March--which drew U.S. criticism for their
harsh treatment of civilians--succeeded in stopping at least some
Palestinian suicide bombers. For example, the official said, no attacks
originated in Ramallah during Israel's three-day invasion of that West
Bank city; as soon as troops left, the assailants headed again from
Ramallah for Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "Reoccupying Palestinian cities is not the ultimate military solution,
and of course it's not a political solution, but it can be very effective
at reducing attacks," the official said. "Israeli presence has its
advantages."</TE>
<TE>   Netanya, the site of Wednesday's devastation, has been hit by several
attacks in the last year and a half. It sits just six miles west of the
West Bank, and keeping Palestinians out has proved impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Media reports said Odeh, the bomber, had worked in hotels in Netanya
and was on a list of men Israel wanted arrested. A security guard posted
at the front door of the Park Hotel on Wednesday night failed to notice
or stop him. A clerk at the reception desk did notice Odeh and tried to
ask him what he wanted and where he was going.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't answer and instead bolted toward the crowded dining hall.</TE>

<HD>Arab Summit Bogs Down; Palestinians Stage Walkout</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Arafat isn't allowed to give speech via satellite,
prompting delegation's exit. Dispute overshadows Saudi leader's call for
peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>The Palestinians stormed out of the Arab League summit here
Wednesday after their host refused to let Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat address the assembled dignitaries via satellite hookup, and
hopes of forging a unified Arab proposal for Middle East peace slipped
away with them.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute, which Lebanese President Emile Lahoud characterized as a
"misunderstanding," overshadowed the much-anticipated speech of Crown
Prince Abdullah, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The crown prince
laid out a simple, if vague, vision for making peace with Israel, one
that at its core promised "normal relations" with all Arab states in
exchange for Israel's withdrawal from lands occupied since the 1967
Middle East War.</LD>
<LD>   But the minute his speech ended, a conference already marked by
disunity and a long list of no-shows slipped into free fall, prompting
charges of petty rivalries and inspiring several eulogies for the lost
opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   The brouhaha over Arafat's speech--to have been given from confinement
in his West Bank headquarters--appeared to have been settled Wednesday
night, and the Palestinian delegation was expected to return today for
the summit's final day. But the damage was already done. Even if the
Saudi peace plan is adopted today, few here expect it to hold much
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   At the summit, theories abounded as to why Lahoud thwarted the
Palestinian leader's efforts to speak live. Lahoud explained his move by
saying he was afraid that Israel would intercept the satellite signal and
beam Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon into the hall. Others said it
was simply arrogance on the part of the president. And still others said
that because Lahoud owes his position to Syrian support, his actions
probably were taken in behalf of Syria's apparent efforts to torpedo the
Saudi initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is some Arabs who are not pleased with the Saudi
proposal," said Gibran Tueni, editor in chief of Lebanon's largest daily
newspaper, An Nahar. "They are not interested in Arab interests, only in
their own."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout its history, the Arab League has been riven by controversy
and intra-Arab conflicts. But after Sept. 11, and with the intensity of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at an all-time high, it had appeared
that Arab leaders would be willing to set aside their differences to try
to break the cycle of violence while improving the image of the Arab
world.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians entered the conference hopeful that they could return to
Arafat's Ramallah headquarters with the full support of the Arab
community, and the moral authority that would come from extending an
olive branch to Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Those hopes were diminished even before the summit began. More than
half of the heads of state skipped the gathering, including the two most
important moderate voices in the Arab world, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah II.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak first said he wasn't attending because of domestic
obligations, then amended that to say he was sitting out the conference
in solidarity with Arafat. King Abdullah said he was "exhausted" from a
recent working trip abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But even with their seats empty, Saudi Arabia's Abdullah tried to move
his initiative forward.</TE>
<TE>   In his 10-minute speech, the crown prince laid out a bare-bones plan
in which Israel, in addition to returning to pre-1967 borders, would cede
control of East Jerusalem to a new Palestinian state, while also allowing
the return of Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come for Israel to put its trust in peace after it has
gambled on war for decades without success," the Saudi declared in a
portion of the speech that he said was aimed at the Israeli people.
"Israel, and the world, must understand that peace and the retention of
the occupied Arab territories are incompatible and impossible to
reconcile or achieve."</TE>
<TE>   The wording of the speech was changed slightly from a draft resolution
a day earlier, reflecting an effort to satisfy some of the more hard-line
members of the Arab League, primarily Syria.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment Saudi Arabia launched its initiative, Syria has
objected on two counts: It didn't want to promise fully "normalized"
relations with Israel, and it was upset that the plan did not guarantee
the right of return for about 4 million Palestinian refugees.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Abdullah did add the term "return of refugees"--an
ambiguous phrase that is not the same as the "right of return," which
Israel rejects, yet is closer to what Syria had sought.</TE>
<TE>   But the attempt at compromise language didn't appear to work.
Immediately after the crown prince was done, Syrian President Bashar
Assad, while not objecting to the Saudi plan, said that the only way to
achieve peace was to continue to support the Palestinian uprising, and to
have the Arab world sever all political ties with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The latter was a shot at Egypt and Jordan, which have signed peace
treaties with the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time for action to save the Palestinian people from the
massacres, from the new Holocaust, that they are being subjected to,"
Assad said in his 45-minute speech.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the Palestinians didn't get a chance to speak for
themselves. Lahoud had told members of the Palestinian delegation in the
morning that Arafat couldn't speak via satellite because there was no
precedent for such an act. The delegation had objected, and Lahoud had
agreed to allow Arafat to be beamed into the conference room when Assad
was done, Palestinian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, Arafat was all ready to go. He sat patiently, for about
three hours, waiting to read his speech to the gathering. But when Assad
was finished, Lahoud called on someone else to go next.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian delegation rose in a huff and walked out. The Saudi
delegation followed suit. Although the Saudis didn't formally withdraw
from the conference, they told the Palestinians that they would if asked.
Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian Cabinet minister, slammed the Lebanese
president.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way left to express himself to this conference was through
the electronic entrance," Shaath said of Arafat. "He was prevented from
doing that by the president of this conference. Now we are out of the
conference."</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, a disgusted Arafat gave his speech on the pan-Arab
satellite TV network Al Jazeera, which broadcast it throughout the
region.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian leadership confirms that it welcomes the enlightened,
brave initiative launched by . . . Crown Prince Abdullah," Arafat said.
"This initiative, God willing, will turn into an Arab initiative at this
summit for the peace of the brave between us and the Israeli and Jewish
people."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Beirut, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa was trying to
mediate the spat, which threatened to pull the plug on the second day of
the summit. One non-Arab official said the skirmish demonstrated that the
Arab world "never misses a chance to miss a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Sensing the public embarrassment that a complete collapse would mean
for Lebanon, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri agreed to escort the Palestinian
delegation back into the conference as a sort of public mea culpa on
behalf of the president. The Lebanese also agreed to broadcast Arafat's
speech to the gathering, but because it had already appeared around the
world via satellite, there was talk late Wednesday that perhaps they
would just hand it out.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the whole affair proved a serious distraction from the
substantive issues that the conference sought to address.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to sidetracking the Saudi proposal, the Arafat imbroglio
also took attention away from the Iraq-Kuwait dispute. Iraq was quietly
trying to present itself as ready to end its impasse with Kuwait, whose
invasion by Baghdad led to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Iraq said it
recognized Kuwaiti sovereignty and as a show of good faith announced that
it was releasing a Kuwaiti detainee. Kuwait dismissed the Iraqi overtures
as "sweet talk."</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Abdullah bin Zaid al Nahayan, the information minister of the
United Arab Emirates, summed up the day's events: "The summit is heading
toward total chaos."</TE>

<KH>MILTON BERLE 1908-2002</KH>
<HD>Legendary Comedic Trouper Dies</HD>
<DH>Obituary: Career spanned vaudeville, radio and film, but he was
'Mr. Television.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton Berle, whose "anything for a laugh" ethos propelled him
through a career that began in vaudeville, continued on radio, exploded
on television and didn't end until his doctors told him, finally, that he
had to quit it with the jokes onstage, died Wednesday. He was 93.</LD>
<LD>   Berle died in his sleep at his home on Los Angeles' Westside
surrounded by his wife, Lorna, and other family members.</LD>
<LD>   The indefatigable comic had continued to work as he neared his 90th
birthday, though he stayed offstage under doctors' orders after suffering
a mild stroke in December 1998. He was diagnosed with colon cancer last
April and had been in failing health for some time.</LD>
<TE>   Berle was the first of television's great stars and its first and
greatest salesman--of television and TV sets. There were fewer than
500,000 sets in use in America when Berle took to the air on the National
Broadcasting Company's "Texaco Star Theater" in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, there were a million, and by the time the show finished
its run in 1954, more than 26 million homes had television.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times several years ago, Berle still had a
trademark cigar by his side, though on that day it remained unlit. The
stroke had left him "wobbly," he said, but his sense of humor and fiery
attitude--the egomania that friends could abide with a grin and enemies
couldn't forgive--were still sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you want, I'll give you a joke on it. But to give it to you
on the spur of the moment, that's the trick. That means the noggin's
working," he said over an afternoon snack in his condominium, during
which he summoned his butler to retrieve one of his two encyclopedic joke
books, "Milton Berle's Private Joke File" and "More of the Best of Milton
Berle's Private Joke File."</TE>
<TE>   To the end, Berle was a fixture at the Friars Club of California in
Beverly Hills, where he was a regular presence at lunchtime, often with
longtime friend Buddy Arnold, who helped pen the theme to Berle's seminal
TV series "Texaco Star Theater."</TE>
<TE>   Honored at the Friars on his 91st birthday, Berle, the club's abbot
emeritus with roots going back to the original Friars Club in New York,
stood at the end of a long evening of tributes and told the gathering:
"I'll be brief. And if you believe that, you believe there'll be a
Richard Simmons Jr."</TE>
<TE>   Friars Club of California President Irwin Schaeffer said Wednesday
that Berle had been at the club as recently as three weeks ago. Schaeffer
then gave the phone to Buddy Hackett, who remembered how Berle got him to
become a Friar in 1947 and summed up his contribution to comedy this way:
"Whatever you see on television, Milton did it first. We used to have a
lot of variety shows on television. No one knew what they were doing, no
one knew how to do it. He showed them how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Arnold could not be reached at his home in Florida. In a statement
released through his publicist, comedian Don Rickles said, "From the
first days of my career, he was one of my comedic heroes. He was always a
great mentor. His style of comedy will never be replaced."</TE>
<TE>'Holding Court' Just Weeks Ago</TE>
<TE>   Warren Cowan, Berle's publicist for many years, said that he had been
to Berle's condo five weeks ago to celebrate the 10th anniversary of
Berle's marriage to his third wife, Lorna. More than 100 people were
there, Cowan said, and Berle "was holding court and making everyone
laugh, and he looked great. And that's the last time I really saw
Milton."</TE>
<TE>   Today, in an era when few if any comedians are able to cultivate an
enduring image onstage, Berle was a larger-than-life personality whose
voracious comedic appetite not only prompted his notorious joke-stealing
but also his willingness to don a dress. In the process, he became
unforgettable to viewers. It was a persona as memorable as Jack Benny's
skinflint or Bob Hope's confident but ever-rejected lover.</TE>
<TE>   It was essentially "caveman comedy," said longtime comedy writer Larry
Gelbart, whose credits range from TV's "MASH" to the film "Tootsie."
"But, by God, you find yourself laughing at the silliness of it, the
manic-ness."</TE>
<TE>   He was Milton Berlinger by birth. He became Milton Berle so the name
could fit more easily on a marquee. Later, he would be Uncle Miltie and
even "Mr. Television."</TE>
<TE>   Berle became an institution. The comic mania that made him an electric
stage presence translated well to live TV. Restaurant business fell off
sharply at 8 p.m. Tuesdays when the show went on. A graph of water usage
in Detroit showed a peak from 9 to 9:05 p.m., when, after Berle's hour
was up, viewers dashed to the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dresses and crazy antics, Berle, in reality, was something
of a man about town in his prime. His private life, in the 1930s and
1940s, was grist for the gossip columnists.</TE>
<TE>   Berle was born July 12, 1908, in Manhattan, the son of Moses
Berlinger, a paint shop owner, and Sarah Berlinger, a department store
detective who would later change her first name to Sandra and become a
quintessential stage mother, hovering over Berle's professional life for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to be [in show business], but her parents wouldn't allow
her because they thought it was too racy," Berle said. "When I started to
make faces in the mirror at age 5, [my] Uncle Joe would say, 'Get that
damn kid away from the mirror, he's going to turn out to be an idiot.' So
when I started to make money at age 15, 16, she said [to my uncle], 'I
want you to meet the idiot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Because his parents had no money for a Halloween costume, the
5-year-old Milton put on one of his father's suits, rolling up the
sleeves and legs, and grabbed dad's derby. He cut out a piece of his
mother's fur muff and pasted it under his nose. A paper chrysanthemum
from the vase in the parlor went into Milton's lapel--and he became a
midget Charlie Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   Berle won a Chaplin look-alike contest for kids at a local vaudeville
theater, worked for an agency as a model for Buster Brown children's
clothes and within months was playing kid parts in silent movies filmed
in New York. His first bit job was in "The Perils of Pauline," an
adventure serial in which he was the child thrown from the train.</TE>
<TE>   The studios paid his way to Hollywood for more work in "The Mark of
Zorro" with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mack Sennett's "Tillie's Punctured
Romance," starring Chaplin.</TE>
<TE>   He played vaudeville theaters in New York and Philadelphia, appearing
on the same bill with such stars as Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson.</TE>
<TE>   On the road almost constantly in his teenage years, Berle appeared in
a vaudeville act with a child actress, living out of a trunk, always
guided and sheltered by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered dizziness and blackouts at one point, and Sandra Berle, in
a pragmatic bow to the welfare of her son, started to bring girls
backstage to meet her son after the show. He wrote about it later in his
1974 autobiography:</TE>
<TE>   "God knows Mama loved me, and she was scared stiff about the
blackouts. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "I found out that when Mama took her seat for the show, she always
picked it next to an attractive girl, always five or six years older than
myself. She'd strike up a conversation with the girl during the show. If
the girl said anything during or after my act to show she found me
attractive, Mama offered to bring her back to meet me. What happened
after that, Mama never wanted to know."</TE>
<TE>Routines Had Roots in Vaudeville</TE>
<TE>   It was as a vaudeville star that Berle, in the 1920s and early 1930s,
began to develop the jokes, songs and comedy routines that were to serve
him so well 20 years later on television. He also began working as a
master of ceremonies, filling time between acts and the movies which,
more and more, were dominating the shows at the expense of live
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "He always made things seem fresh, no matter how many times he'd done
it in the past," comedian Jan Murray said at Berle's 91st birthday
tribute. "I was amazed at how quick he was on his feet. He completely
fooled me. You'd never know that it was a standard bit of business."</TE>
<TE>   That same night, Steve Allen noted that Berle had been his baby-sitter
while Allen's parents, vaudeville entertainers, were onstage performing.</TE>
<TE>   Berle began to collect the jokes that he would use over the
years--about 50,000 were in his repertoire by the late 1940s. As it
happened, a lot of them belonged to other comedians. When columnist
Walter Winchell labeled Berle "The Thief of Bad Gags," Berle didn't deny
it.</TE>
<TE>   "Like every comedian, if I heard a joke that I thought would work, I
used it," he once said. Still, the penchant for lifting any joke that
came his way prompted Fred Allen to call him "a parrot with skin on."</TE>
<TE>   With his growing success in vaudeville and nightclubs, Berle got other
offers. He made his first radio appearance in 1934, and in the following
years did numerous guest appearances on radio, including Rudy Vallee's
coast-to-coast hour.</TE>
<TE>   Radio was not Berle's strong point, however, because it failed to
exploit his great physical energy. Nor did the movies prove an ideal
match.</TE>
<TE>   "Milton was the comedic equivalent of Ethel Merman," Gelbart said. "He
was just a little too big for the screen. And in those days film moguls
were a little sensitive about Jews on the screen. Milton's Eastern
[European] origins didn't help him."</TE>
<TE>   "His pushy attitude was just too much for film," added Howard Morris,
who directed Berle in the 1967 comedy "Who's Minding the Mint?" It was
Morris' first feature as a director, and he was warned about Berle's
tyrannical ways. "Everybody said . . . he'll kill you," Morris remembers.
"He not only didn't kill me, he was wonderful," Morris said, adding that
Berle did have one caveat--asking Morris not to give him directions in
front of the cast and crew, but to point up if he wanted more of Berle,
and down if he wanted less.</TE>
<TE>   If Berle never became a film star, his suitability for television
would prove to be another matter.</TE>
<TE>   His first brush with the new medium was in Chicago in 1929--an
experimental closed-circuit system, one of the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the actual broadcast, all I can remember is a small room and
fierce heat from the lights and the heavy makeup we had to wear," Berle
said in his autobiography. "We were a part of history. . . . The
broadcast was sent out to maybe 12 people . . . who had sets."</TE>
<TE>   Berle was more interested in Hollywood at the time. Despite his desire
to make it big in films, he didn't. In 1937, he signed a two-year
contract with RKO Pictures for $3,000 a week and made two films--"New
Faces of 1937" and "Radio City Revels." Both bombed at the box office.</TE>
<TE>Settling Into Married Life</TE>
<TE>   By December 1941, Berle had become perhaps the nation's best-known
nightclub performer. He married a chorus girl, Joyce Matthews--after
years of dating many of the most beautiful ones around--and settled into
married life after taking his mother along on the honeymoon.</TE>
<TE>   The often-stormy marriage to Matthews ended in divorce in 1947, by
which time they had adopted a child. They would remarry two years later,
then divorce again.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Berle signed to do a radio show--"Texaco Star Theater." It
quickly spawned a television offshoot--and the first big hit for a medium
that, thanks to Berle, would never be looked at the same. Indeed,
"Texaco" would earn Berle the nickname "Mr. Television."</TE>
<TE>   The first "Texaco Star Theater" television broadcast went out live
from New York City--on Sept. 21, 1948--from Studio 6B in the RCA building
in Rockefeller Center. Less than two months later, the show was so
popular that it was the only program not preempted on election night for
the returns of the Truman-Dewey presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   The program dominated the ratings for several years, under Berle's
hard-driving, enemy-making control. Berle was a perfectionist, and he
blew a referee's whistle to control rehearsals. He wanted to save his
voice, of course, but the whistle just added to his reputation as a
driving, tyrannical director.</TE>
<TE>   The show was live, and years later Berle had vivid memories of the
fiascoes of unedited television. One night, the train of Berle's gown--he
was in drag--got caught in a rising backdrop and the comedian was lifted
off the stage, screaming and in some danger of injury. The audience
thought it was terrifically funny.</TE>
<TE>   Berle's sister, Rosalind, designed many of his outlandish costumes.
Among those who wrote for the show were Nat Hiken, Aaron Ruben and two
brothers--Danny and Neil Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "No single star permeated television like he did," said pianist Roger
Williams, who performed regularly on Berle's show in the 1950s. "And let
me tell you, an appearance on his show was pure gold. The power he had.
Every performer would kill to be on the 'Texaco Star Theater.' Each time
I did his show, the next day my record would go to the top of the
charts."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Berle also published more than 400 songs.</TE>
<TE>   But just as Berle was the first of television's great stars, he was
one of its first great victims. The ratings began to slip, especially
after Berle abandoned the vaudeville format for something more akin to a
situation comedy approach, and the competition in Berle's Tuesday night
time slot grew increasingly tough--first Gene Autry and Red Skelton, and
finally, Phil Silvers as Sgt. Bilko. Texaco dropped its sponsorship of
his program and was replaced by Buick, which in 1953 presented the
"Buick-Berle Hour."</TE>
<TE>   "I Love Lucy" on CBS became the most popular show on television in
1953. Berle's last show was broadcast on June 14, 1955. Toward the end,
another TV funnyman, rising star Jackie Gleason, said this to an
interviewer about Berle:</TE>
<TE>   "This guy was up there for seven long years. . . . That's a couple of
lifetimes in this TV racket. How many guys you think there are now . . .
who will be up there, blasting away with the funny stuff and holding onto
the top like Berle did?</TE>
<TE>   "Tell you something else. Wasn't for Berle, a lot of us wouldn't have
got a break. When he became Mr. Television, those network guys began
saying, 'We gotta get comics. They want funny stuff. Let's get funnymen.'
Whatever else you say about Berle, don't forget that. And don't count him
out, don't ever count him out. He'll be in there pitching for a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   And he was. With a 30-year contract from NBC that paid him $200,000 a
year, Berle tried several relatively short-lived shows from California:
"The Milton Berle Show" (1955-56), "Kraft Music Hall" (1958-59) and
"Jackpot Bowling" (1960-61).</TE>
<TE>   In his book "So Far, So Funny," Hal Kanter recounted the year he spent
producing "Kraft Music Hall," alternately trying to tame the meddling,
egomaniacal Berle and giving in to his demands. This included Berle's
insistence that Kanter use a laugh track "to augment" the response Berle
was certain to get from his studio audience.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Kanter wrote, Berle was "the Thomas Edison of our comedy
theater, and every comedian working in his giant shadow owes him an
enormous debt."</TE>
<TE>   In the years after his television series, Berle remained busy--playing
nightclubs and Las Vegas, doing both serious and comedic character roles
in movies and on television. On the road, he made a habit of pinning the
drapes in his hotel room shut to keep out the light.</TE>
<TE>   "Going up in an elevator, he'd make fun of a lady's dress, and she'd
thank him," said Glenn Schwartz, Berle's publicist when the comedian was
in his 80s and still on the road.</TE>
<TE>   After his second divorce from Matthews, Berle married movie studio
publicist Ruth Cosgrove in 1953 and adopted another child. This marriage
lasted until Cosgrove's death in 1989. Berle married his third wife,
Lorna, a 50-year-old fashion designer, in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Though he toured extensively, Berle was arguably never more in his
milieu than at the Friars Club, the famed fraternity for comedians and
ribald humor.</TE>
<TE>   A fixture on the dais when a celebrity was being "roasted" in typical
foulmouthed fashion, Berle pounded away. "What a crowd!" he said at Frank
Sinatra's roast. "I would say mob, but you know how sensitive Frank is."</TE>
<TE>   In later years, as he grew older and comedy changed before his eyes,
Berle led the occasional workshop at the Friars for young comics, hoping
to impart his hard-bitten wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   His pupils, of a sort, included Arnold Schwarzenegger, who met Berle
in the mid-1980s. The two shared numerous interests, including cigars,
fitness and comedy.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Schwarzenegger was a budding action lead but still
looking to become a bigger movie star. Berle, said Schwarzenegger, helped
him navigate his way through celebrity using humor as a vehicle, even
writing jokes Schwarzenegger could use at functions and with the media.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in my position, where your life is so obvious, it lends
itself to great comedy," Schwarzenegger said.</TE>
<TE>   Berle often bemoaned the lazy approach of his comedic successors.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever happened to 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen?' " he said
in his 1999 interview with The Times, bemoaning the slapdash manner with
which some contemporary comics greeted an audience. Though he had
admiration for younger comedians, Berle steadfastly maintained that the
giants of his craft were Henny Youngman, Groucho Marx and Jack Benny.</TE>
<TE>   Berle sued NBC in the spring of 2000, claiming that the network had
lost nearly 130 kinescope film reels of his early shows. He later dropped
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Retire?" he said when asked</TE>
<TE>   about that possibility, smiling that familiar grin of his and flicking
ashes from his ever-present cigar. "Retire to what?"</TE>
<TE>   Berle is survived by his wife, Lorna; a daughter, Victoria; a son,
William; and two stepdaughters, Susan and Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<HD>Really Big Doings at the Ports</HD>
<DH>The already huge L.A.-Long Beach complex is going gigantic to meet
surging demand. Ships, tugs, cranes and bridges are all super-sizing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he often does in the company of giants, Greg Mitre proceeded
gingerly.</LD>
<LD>   He slowly drove his 105-foot-tall crane alongside a vessel which
stretched further than three football fields.</LD>
<LD>   The crane groaned and swayed on the Long Beach wharf as it hoisted
30-ton containers--called "cans" by the dockworkers--onto the ship.
Working from his sky-high cab, Mitre stacked the cans five high and just
inches apart, each touching down with a thunderous boom.</LD>
<TE>   "Working here can be like walking through a herd of stampeding
elephants!" he shouted over the din. "It's organized chaos on a colossal
scale!"</TE>
<TE>   Machinery the size of a Home Depot. Cables thick as tree trunks.
Caravans of 18-wheelers. Ships 150 feet longer than the Eiffel Tower is
tall.</TE>
<TE>   Mitre's world is indeed colossal. And it's about to get much larger.</TE>
<TE>   By year's end, the marvels of post-World War II engineering found at
the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex--100-acre terminals,
800-foot-long vessels, tugboats with 3,000 horsepower under their
hoods--will seem like diminutive relics.</TE>
<TE>   Port authorities are calling it a shift in scale from big to mega-big,
and it's needed, they say, to keep up with global economic trends.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, an insatiable American appetite for cheap imported goods
is driving demand for bigger ships, which require more powerful tugboats,
larger terminals with longer wharves, higher bridges, mightier cranes,
and more trucks and trains to handle the freight.</TE>
<TE>   Current forecasts say that over the next two decades port traffic at
the 15,000-acre complex--the nation's busiest--is going to double. Maybe
triple. It would join Hong Kong and Singapore as one of the world's most
productive ports.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation takes a step--and, predictably, a giant one--in
April with the opening of Southern California's biggest public works
project ever, the Alameda Corridor. The $2.4-billion partially
below-ground railroad system features a concrete trench 33 feet deep, 50
feet wide and 10 miles long.</TE>
<TE>   At least 100 trains a day--hauling $100 billion worth of goods a
year--will course the rail that will link train yards south of downtown
Los Angeles to the harbor, where the first two so-called "mega-terminals"
are scheduled to open this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Monuments of pavement, those terminals will feature wharves a mile
long and space to handle up to six giant cargo vessels--and 2 million
"cans"--at a time. Towering over the terminals will be dozens of new
computerized cranes up to 240 feet tall with mechanical arms reaching 210
feet beyond the wharf.</TE>
<TE>   "These cranes are engineering marvels," said Doug Thiessen, the Port
of Long Beach's chief harbor engineer. "When people see them, they'll be
in awe."</TE>
<TE>   The cranes will load and unload a new generation of cargo ships with
room to carry the equivalent of 6,600 20-foot containers--enough to
stretch 25 miles. On drawing boards are plans for even larger
ships--behemoths able to carry the equivalent of 15,000 "cans."</TE>
<TE>   Such monsters would be too big to squeeze beneath Long Beach's
36-year-old Gerald Desmond Bridge, a 165-foot-high, 410-foot-long arch
spanning the murky Cerritos Channel. So the city aims to replace it
within four years with a $350-million suspension bridge at least 20 feet
higher and 200 feet longer.</TE>
<TE>A 'Mega-Leap' Into the Future</TE>
<TE>   For those traveling on that bridge, or crossing the better-known
Vincent Thomas Bridge over the Los Angeles River, it's hard to appreciate
the super-sized world of the ports: Because everything is big, nothing
appears out of scale. But stand on the deck of the Cornelius Maersk and
the jaw-dropping vastness of it all takes hold.</TE>
<TE>   The ship is 1,057 feet long and, and after steering it into port one
midnight recently, Capt. Henrik Larsen noted that, among cargo ships,
"She's the biggest on the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   "Fully loaded, she weighs 140,000 tons," Larsen said, of the Cornelius
Maersk, which arrived laden with freight ranging from bulldozers and race
cars to jogging shoes and frozen chicken feet. "She's has a
75,000-horsepower engine with an auxiliary booster to add 8,000
horsepower more, if needed."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating more cargo ships of unprecedented size, port operators
are beefing up their tugboat fleets with new high-performance models that
can literally spin like a top around the traditional 1,200-horsepower
single-propeller styles.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent crowded news conference, Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill
proudly announced the arrival of Foss Maritime Co.'s "6,250-horsepower,
98-foot Enhanced Azmuthing Stern Drive 'ASD' Thurster Tug."</TE>
<TE>   That's a technical way of saying it's the largest tugboat in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The boat's engineer, Jerry Allen, was not joshing when he said, "This
is a mega-leap in tugs. It's got a 20-ton increase in pull over anything
else on the water. It's as though your team suddenly put 22 players on
the football field."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial fishermen who tie at San Pedro's 75-year-old docks
regard them as port bullies.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning against the railing at the Ports O' Call wharf, fisherman
Steve Sullivan carped to another boater about a recent close encounter.
Shorty before dawn on Jan. 21, his 59-ton trawler was slammed by a new
500-ton tug that apparently lost control because of a computer glitch.</TE>
<TE>   Nodding toward four of the hulking tugs tied up just a few yards from
his boat, Sullivan grumbled, "They throttle up like locomotives and leave
a wake high enough to surf on."</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Venieris, of Cal State Long Beach's Center for International
Trade and Transportation, said problems are to be expected as the
harbor--and nearly everything in it--grows right out of its skin.</TE>
<TE>   "The big question is this: Are we ready for all this growth?" she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Port authorities insist that this growth spurt is the last because
they've finally run out of room.</TE>
<TE>   Such proclamations fall flat in neighboring communities where years of
feeling overwhelmed by polluting port-expansion projects have fueled the
current harbor area secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   No other facility in Southern California produces more traffic
congestion or air pollution than the port complex. One ship dumps an
average of four tons of pollutants into the skies with each docking and
departure. Over the next two decades, the number of big-rig trucks
rolling in and out of the complex is expected to jump from 34,000 to
nearly 92,000 each day.</TE>
<TE>   Even the garbage--and the general mess--is bigger at the port.</TE>
<TE>   During a tour of her seaside working-class neighborhood in Wilmington,
where dodging big rigs has long been a way of life, Lucy Mejia shook her
head in dismay and said, "Look what the port has done to my town."</TE>
<TE>   Pointing at a hill stacked five high with rusted containers, she
added, "That's our Matterhorn."</TE>
<TE>   A mile away in San Pedro, residents and environmentalists have been
mounting legal challenges against alleged environmental violations by
port officials, and proposing remedies for blight, such as collapsible
cranes and floating gardens that could mask the grimiest terminal
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles port says we're expendable in the face of an
overriding need and an emerging global economy," said Noel Park,
president of the San Pedro and Peninsula Homeowners Assn. "It suggests we
should sacrifice ourselves like so much collateral damage. Does anyone
really think we're going to agree with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Not really.</TE>
<TE>   But with at least half a dozen more mega-terminals in the works at the
harbors, port authorities have launched public relations campaigns
extolling the benefits of the harbor complex, which already supports
roughly 260,000 jobs and handles more than 5,500 commercial vessels and
$170 billion of commerce a year.</TE>
<TE>Impressive in a Number of Areas</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, work continues at a furious pace at the $800-million,
483-acre Pier 400 facility being built on 10 million tons of rock in the
Port of Los Angeles for Maersk Sealand.</TE>
<TE>   The entire UCLA campus could fit inside that terminal--with room to
spare.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on a berm overlooking what will soon be the most expansive
terminal on Earth, Stacy Jones, the Port of Los Angeles' chief engineer,
said, "There has to be a better understanding of what this project and
this harbor are all about, which is serving the needs of a five-county
population base."</TE>
<TE>   A few hundred yards to the south, skip loaders and dump trucks teemed
over a mile-long wharf edging the 500,000 tons of freshly laid asphalt at
Long Beach's Goliath terminal, 375-acre Pier T.</TE>
<TE>   That $500-million terminal rests on the recycled asphalt and concrete
of the former Long Beach Naval Station and Naval Shipyard.</TE>
<TE>   Also tagged for demolition there is a spectacular vestige of the
harbor's military heritage: Naval Dry Dock No. 1, a 70-foot deep,
108-foot wide, 1,200-foot-long concrete-and-steel chasm christened in
1941 to service aircraft carriers and battleships.</TE>
<TE>   The dry dock, which serviced the 887-foot, 45,000-ton behemoth
battleship Missouri as recently as 1985, will soon be filled with dirt
and capped with asphalt to create more room for cargo containers.</TE>
<TE>   "Regarding it as a useless hole in the ground kills me, just kills me.
It goes against everything I know," lamented retired Navy Capt. Richard
Hepburn, who was docking manager at the facility from 1983 to 1985. "It
was once a phenomenal engineering achievement for its generation; a
product of an enormous amount of human pain and effort, concrete and
steel."</TE>
<TE>   Port authorities would say that the dry dock, like the venerable
"Mighty Mo," which saw combat in World War II and the Persian Gulf War,
served its purpose.</TE>
<TE>The Ins and Outs of Global Consumption</TE>
<TE>   These days the harbor favors commercial consumption on a gigantic
scale. Moving cargo in and out quickly requires a surprising delicacy and
necessary precision.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the breakwater at dusk, chief mate John Zarroli maneuvered a
new 4,800-horsepower tug--which had the crisp smell of a new
car--alongside the nose of an incoming oil tanker that, up close, looked
as high as a canyon wall.</TE>
<TE>   Another tug just like it was positioned at the big ship's stern. In
carefully synchronized maneuvers, the tugs helped the tanker--which is
400 feet longer than Los Angeles City Hall is tall--glide past the
breakwater, then make an immediate 47-degree turn into a 1,200-foot-wide,
two-mile channel.</TE>
<TE>   In the channel, the three ships slid past an eerie nighttime landscape
of idling barges, flaming refinery towers, mountains of scrap metal being
picked over by skip loaders, and red 100-foot cranes, their long steel
arms pointing skyward. It was oddly quiet, a stunning contrast to
ever-present roar of heavy machinery and warning horns the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "The motto at the port is, 'If you're not making noise, you're not
making moves,' " said crane operator Mitre. "The company wants a certain
number of moves each day."</TE>
<TE>   It's a dangerous business.</TE>
<TE>   Reported injuries at the harbor have diminished with the advent of new
technologies, despite the industrial growth at the port. Still, about
once a year, a port worker dies in an accident. As one dock worker put
it, these days "a little bump on the machinery and you're toast."</TE>
<TE>   In separate recent incidents, a man was crushed to death while working
200 feet above ground on a cargo crane. Another crane crushed a
supervisor to death after a cable snapped. Just this month, a 63-year-old
longshoreman was killed when a 3,000-pound metal disk fell from a
shipboard crane at Long Beach's Pier F. A few years ago, a man fell to
his death in the 72-foot-deep cargo hold of a ship.</TE>
<TE>   Mitre's younger brother, Jeff Mitre, lost five toes a year and a half
ago when a seven-ton steel beam fell off a forklift and onto his right
foot.</TE>
<TE>   Now, just the sights and sounds of the port make him anxious. So it
was a welcome surprise when the 38-year-old surfer showed up on a recent
weekday to say hello and admire the view from the catwalk of his
brother's crane.</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the frantic pace of construction going on below in almost
every direction, he said, "I'm trying to get used to coming back out
here."</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, when we used to carry things on our backs, we
suffered lots of back pains and cuts. But now, look out baby!" he said.
"You need eyes in the back of your head because Mr. Production is always
breathing down your neck and everything is huge, heavy and moving fast."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking about trying a new line of work," he said. "Maybe a
clerical job."</TE>

<DH>Afghanistan: Parents were helpless as roofs crushed their children
in quake. Some lost them all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAHRIN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Abdul Majid stood in a hillside cemetery, staring at the four
little mounds at his feet.</LD>
<LD>   "When I look at them," he said, "my children suddenly appear before my
eyes."</LD>
<LD>   His neighbor Palwasha paced a ruined courtyard with dusty baby clothes
in her hands.</LD>
<TE>   "Allah, Allah, Allah," she softly cried.</TE>
<TE>   In market towns like this one, the streets are usually teeming with
kids flying kites, playing soccer and trailing visitors. But Wednesday,
there was a strange hush in Nahrin.</TE>
<TE>   The children were missing.</TE>
<TE>   A day after aid workers and government officials arrived in this
earthquake-devastated region of northeastern Afghanistan, there was still
confusion about the number of fatalities from Monday's earthquake,
estimated at between 800 and 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing was clear: Most of them were young.</TE>
<TE>   In one village, 20 of the 23 victims were younger than 16. Farmer
after farmer told heart-rending stories of watching roofs crash down on
their families and being powerless to dig them out.</TE>
<TE>   In another village, six children died in one mud hut.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say 80% of our victims, maybe 90%, were not yet 15," said
Sayed Askar, an elder in Nahrin, the hardest-hit town.</TE>
<TE>   Children here, in this wheat and melon farming district 105 miles
north of the capital, Kabul, tend not to venture out of their mud-walled
compounds after dark. When the magnitude 6.1 quake hit Monday at 7:30
p.m., most were in their homes, probably with a plate of rice and a slice
of nan bread in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Some didn't understand what was happening. Others were unable to
scramble to safety and were felled by bricks that wouldn't have stopped
an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "A child's steps aren't so long," Askar said.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly how many children died. The interim government is
sticking to its initial estimate of 1,200 fatalities, adult and children,
although Nahrin village elders said the total is closer to 2,000. U.N.
officials provided a much lower figure of 800 but acknowledged that they
had surveyed only 42 villages out of 78, in one of three districts
affected.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not getting the high casualty counts we had feared," said
Farhana Faruqi, the U.N. coordinator for northern Afghanistan. "But
there's entire areas we still need to assess."</TE>
<TE>   The relief effort kicked in Wednesday as 200 aid workers busied
themselves scheduling food drops, making assessments and handing out the
first tents and blankets, using the bazaar area of Nahrin as a base.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan soldiers dynamited several boulders blocking roads. A team of
U.S. Army troops stationed at the Bagram air base, about 60 miles south
of here, swooped down in two helicopters and unloaded dozens of boxes of
medical supplies under armed guard. The majestic snowcaps of the Hindu
Kush mountains glowed behind them.</TE>
<TE>   The earth continued to ripple, and one magnitude 5.3 aftershock
Wednesday toppled more buildings, leaving some areas of Nahrin, such as
Shahr-i-Kohna, "the old city," a wasteland of loose bricks and flattened
houses. Two mosques and the main school also were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 villagers are homeless, and aid officials said one of
the top priorities is finding them places to live.</TE>
<TE>   There are some things, however, that nobody can replace.</TE>
<TE>   Every time she feels an aftershock, Palwasha, a pretty woman with rich
olive skin and flashing eyes, relives the moment that four of her five
children were crushed.</TE>
<TE>   She had just laid out a dinner of rice, cabbage, bread and tea when
her 2-year-old daughter, Selsela, reached for the cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, she heard a huge crash, "like a storm from the sky," and the
roof of her home cracked open over her head. Her children were instantly
buried. It wasn't until she pulled out her 8-year-old son, Rohulamin,
that she knew that any had survived.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, God, let me keep one," she remembered saying.</TE>
<TE>   The boy had fainted, but a neighbor massaged his chest, reviving him.</TE>
<TE>   She will be sad for the rest of her life, her brother said as
Palwasha, who uses one name, retreated into a corner of her yard. There,
next to a smashed lantern and dented pots, was a pile of children's
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   She wouldn't let go of them.</TE>
<TE>   Some people here believe that God was punishing Nahrin.</TE>
<TE>   "When people don't worship, these things happen," said Mohammed Allam,
a top military commander here.</TE>
<TE>   Nahrin sits on queasy ground, and every year there's at least one
earthquake. Earlier this month, a magnitude 7.2 quake shook neighboring
Samangan province, killing 100 people. Although Monday's quake was of a
lesser magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey said it was relatively
shallow--about 40 miles beneath the surface--and therefore more
dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about home construction and why heavier beams aren't used
to support mud walls, Allam dismissed the question with a wave of his
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not Americans," he said. "We can't think of such things."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that most villagers are too poor to afford metal roofs,
which would be much safer than thick, crumbly mud.</TE>
<TE>   When the quake hit, many people said, there were no warnings, no
tremors, just the roaring noise of homes imploding. Majid, the father who
lost four children, snatched up his two youngest but was unable to reach
the others in his hut.</TE>
<TE>   Three died instantly. But his 7-year-old daughter survived the initial
quake, sheltered in a cavity in the ruins of his house.</TE>
<TE>   "With all my voice, I yelled to my neighbors, 'Help me, help me, help
me!' " remembered Majid, a 45-year-old laborer.</TE>
<TE>   But the dark night was haunted by frantic parents shouting: "Where is
my son? Where is my daughter?" and nobody came to his aid.</TE>
<TE>   A violent aftershock leveled the remains of his home, killing his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Helping people like these is one of the first crucial tests of
Afghanistan's interim government. Several officials have visited the
area, including interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, who flew in by
chopper Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I express my condolences for the people who lost their children and
their beds and houses," Karzai told a group of men gathered in a field.
"We will not forget you."</TE>
<TE>   Then he flew away.</TE>
<TE>   With Afghanistan so in the spotlight, many countries, including the
United States, Russia and Iran, have pledged to assist the people of
Nahrin. But aid givers face a distinctly Afghan set of problems, such as
land mines, impassable mountain roads and serious ethnic tensions.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, a group of ethnic Pushtun elders swarmed the tent of one
of Karzai's aides, saying they were being cut out of relief efforts by
the ethnic Tajiks who control Nahrin. Karzai is a Pushtun. His aide, an
ethnic Tajik, denied the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the bigger issue of people simply too frightened to
return to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   As Majid stood over the four fresh graves dug into the hillside, he
vowed to live in the fields for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Never again under a roof," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A friend tried to cheer him up. Foreigners are here, the friend said.
Much food will be coming.</TE>
<TE>   Majid looked at the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "For whom?" he asked sharply. "My mouths don't need to be fed
anymore."</TE>

<HD>Welfare Plan Would Count Family Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, which has declared the "well-being of
children" an official goal of welfare policy, would allow low-income
parents to meet part of their work requirements by participating in
organized activities with their children, including Scouts, boys and
girls clubs, educational programs and sports.</LD>
<LD>   "Moving folks into employment is not the only goal of [the welfare
program], as important as that is," said Wade F. Horn, assistant
secretary for children and families at the Department of Health and Human
Services. "In the end, it's about whether the kids are better off."</LD>
<LD>   The details, which are part of a broader White House proposal to
toughen the work rules for welfare recipients, were not initially spelled
out in the administration's welfare plan, which was unveiled last month.
The nation's $16.5-billion welfare program must be renewed by Congress
this year, forcing the first major debate over welfare policy since a
massive overhaul in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   The allowance for family activities is one example of the
administration's bid to put a distinct imprint on welfare reform--seeking
a substantial work effort from as many recipients as possible, while also
allowing a portion of the workweek to be family friendly. Officials also
hope that parents themselves will benefit through activities in which
they play an important role, for example as an assistant soccer coach,
not merely as a spectator at the game.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the administration's proposed work rules--which also
include a firm demand of 24 hours a week on the job--are overly rigid.
States, they maintain, should be much freer to tailor a broad set of
education, training and other services to fit a family's individual
needs.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Horn, who runs the welfare program, said that active
parental involvement in such organized activities as Head Start, library
programs, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and others that "meet a
reasonable-person test" could be acceptable for up to 16 hours of the
40-hour workweek that is envisioned for welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   He also provided a background document to The Times that says states
would have "tremendous flexibility" to design activities that are helpful
to children and families, "provided the activities are within a
structured setting and participation is monitored."</TE>
<TE>   "Not dropping your kid off so you can have a cup of coffee, but
participating in it jointly" would be a standard, Horn explained. Joint
volunteer efforts, educational programs in which the child is enrolled,
and after-school activities "emphasizing positive youth development," all
are ways of meeting 16 hours of the work requirement, according to the
administration.</TE>
<TE>States Would Have Say in What Counts as Work</TE>
<TE>   It would be up to the states to work out plans that would account for
each individual's work participation.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Wally Herger (R-Marysville), chairman of the House subcommittee
on welfare, said he viewed the child-friendly efforts as part of a larger
attempt to have welfare policy strengthen two-parent families among the
poor.</TE>
<TE>   "If the states choose to, the 16 hours can be used for just about
anything, including programs to promote marriage and to promote more
stable families," he said, describing such goals as an important
remaining frontier for welfare reform.</TE>
<TE>   Herger plans to introduce a welfare bill reflecting the White House
aims next month and said he hoped it would reach the floor by early May.</TE>
<TE>   No one doubts that children can benefit from time spent with
responsible parents, and even those skeptical of the White House approach
refrained from criticizing provisions that would promote parent-child
experiences.</TE>
<TE>   But some minimized the child-friendly proposal, pointing out that it
would only kick in after parents met a much stiffer work requirement than
is now in force, and contending that parents on welfare would still face
enormous pressure to use their time to make money rather than volunteer
for children's activities.</TE>
<TE>   Many welfare parents also face problems of mental health, substance
abuse and other difficulties that could stand in the way of successful
volunteer involvements.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern is the total picture," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of
Maryland, who is sponsoring a major Democratic alternative to the
administration plan. Cardin said that while establishing child well-being
as one goal of welfare "is something we agree with," it's "a stretch" to
conclude that the administration plan gives greater flexibility to states
than is now the case.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, welfare recipients may face a 30-hour weekly work
requirement. But due to certain technicalities and exceptions, the work
demands frequently are not enforced. Only one-third of the 2.1 million
adult recipients work.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants to establish a strict, 24-hour work
requirement with few exceptions. But it would give recipients various
options for the remaining 16 hours of the 40-hour week, including
vocational education and other activities that can help a family become
self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-hour period also includes the child-oriented activities that
Horn outlined in the interview.</TE>
<TE>   Also acceptable would be parent-child "counseling sessions that help
parents build stronger bonds with their children," parenting education
classes and joint participation in after-school activities "emphasizing
positive youth development," according to HHS.</TE>
<TE>   For people with the greatest difficulties in entering the work force,
the White House would also allow three months within any 24-month period
outside of work, in programs that state officials believe will help
prepare them for a job, including treatment for substance abuse,
rehabilitation and training.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody ought to be engaged in some sort of plan that will lead
them toward whatever level of self-sufficiency that person is capable of
achieving," Horn said, terming the administration approach a "universal
engagement strategy."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how many welfare recipients would choose volunteer and
other activities with their children over jobs that pay. Under welfare
reform, states generally limit benefits to five years, so recipients face
growing pressure to find real jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's positive in the sense that it's allowing the states
flexibility to count some positive parenting toward this work requirement
that on the face of it is very strict," said Sheila R. Zedlewski, a
welfare expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank in
Washington. But she added that welfare recipients "also have this other,
competing pressure on them, which is to work more and earn more and leave
welfare. You have to weigh it all. It's a positive, but a small
positive."</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception in the mid-1990s, welfare reform has largely
coincided with a period of economic growth and declining poverty rates.
But the link between welfare reform and the well-being of children
remains unclear in the minds of some researchers.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have proposed that U.S. welfare policy establish the
reduction of poverty as a formal goal. But the administration instead
came up with the broader, if harder-to-measure objective of child
well-being.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also wishes to use welfare policies to promote healthy
marriages, noting that children growing up in single-parent families are
statistically more likely to drop out of school, have their own children
during adolescence and abuse drugs.</TE>

<HD>Setting Up Shop in N. Korea: Car Firm Plunges In</HD>
<DH>Asia: Company linked to Sun Myung Moon's church is to open an
assembly plant in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>At first glance, there couldn't be a more improbable business
proposition than opening an automobile factory in North Korea, where
hardly anybody owns a car or knows how to drive. Even more surprising is
that the company making this investment is an affiliate of the
Unification Church, headed by the thumpingly anti-communist Rev. Sun
Myung Moon.</LD>
<LD>   Against all odds, Pyonghwa Motors next month is opening a $55-million
auto assembly plant where there once were rice paddies in the western
coastal city of Nampo. It is one of the largest private ventures in North
Korea, a bastion of militant communism that only recently has cracked
open its doors to foreign investment in a desperate quest for hard
currency.</LD>
<LD>   "This country was so closed that nobody, not God, not Buddha, could
get in the last 50 years without a visa," Park Sang Kwon, the president
of Pyonghwa Motors, said at a news conference Friday in Seoul, the South
Korean capital, where the company is headquartered. "Nobody, even in my
own company, believed it was possible to build an automobile in North
Korea. Only I believed."</LD>
<TE>   Initially, the assembly line will turn out Fiat Sienas, a compact
model, but Pyonghwa Motors hopes to develop its own model for the North
Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   The communist government, which also owns a stake in the company, has
contracted to buy 1,000 cars in the first year. After that, the company
hopes to sell vehicles in China, Russia and, if the political situation
allows, South Korea. The plant has the potential to turn out 20,000 cars
a year.</TE>
<TE>   The unlikely relationship between the Unification Church and North
Korea dates to 1991, when Moon visited the country's founder and chief
ideologue, Kim Il Sung. That paved the way for Moon, an archconservative
who nonetheless supports dialogue with the North, to buy two hotels in
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, including the 161-room Potonggang,
which boasts of being the only hotel in the isolated country with
satellite television.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans also allowed Moon's followers to develop Jongju, the
northwestern town where Moon was born, into a pilgrimage site--another
coup for the Unification Church because the communist nation bans all
practice of religion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the car assembly plant, Pyonghwa wants to open a
department store, gas stations, automobile showrooms and what the company
described as a "World Peace Center" in Pyongyang to promote cultural and
educational exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Pyonghwa officials say they hope the investments will advance the
reconciliation process between the two Koreas, estranged for more than
half a century. Indeed, the name of the company means "peace" in Korean.</TE>
<TE>   "We will show the North Koreans brotherly love through this project,"
Park, the company president, said Friday, flashing slides for journalists
of North and South Korean employees working together in building the
assembly plant, then clowning around as they pose for a photograph.</TE>
<TE>   From a financial viewpoint, the company hopes that low labor costs
will allow it to turn out automobiles more cheaply than elsewhere in
Asia. The company now employs about 200 North Korean auto workers who are
paid an average of $120 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We are bound to succeed," Park said. "There are no unions, low labor
costs. The workers are very clever, very quick to learn, and they are
harshly controlled by their superiors."</TE>
<TE>   Among the extraordinary problems that Pyonghwa has encountered in
trying to do business in North Korea is the erratic power supply and poor
transportation system. The new plant is situated next to a 2-year-old
highway linking Nampo with Pyongyang, 25 miles to the northeast. However,
the road was constructed with picks and shovels; it does not accommodate
heavy trucks well and frequently needs repairs. Merely putting up a sign
over the front gate of the factory was a struggle, in which capitalism
ultimately triumphed over communism.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time anybody was allowed to put a company logo on a
billboard in North Korea," Park said.</TE>
<TE>   The plant's grand opening, scheduled for April 5, comes as North Korea
is going through a particularly rough patch in trying to attract foreign
investment. The rapprochement with South Korea has ground to a halt,
while President Bush's characterization of North Korea as part of an
"axis of evil" has hardly induced companies to invest.</TE>
<TE>   There also have been a number of well-publicized failures. Hyundai,
the South Korean conglomerate, recently had to turn to its own government
for a bailout to rescue its 3-year-old venture bringing tourists to North
Korea's scenic Mt. Kumgang.</TE>
<TE>   "We advise companies to look carefully, to cross-check everything as
much as possible before doing business in North Korea," said Jean-Jacques
Grauhar, secretary-general of the European Chamber of Commerce in Seoul.
"We don't think the legal framework is satisfactory at this stage, and
the general way of doing business is not yet developed."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its assembly line, Pyonghwa is refurbishing used cars
imported from Japan for resale in North Korea. That business opened early
last year and has brought in about $300,000 in sales.</TE>
<TE>   There are 3,000 passenger cars in North Korea for a population of 23
million. All are said to belong to the government or top officials.</TE>
<TE>   Pyonghwa also owns a Fiat assembly plant in Vietnam and has tried
various automotive projects in China, which so far have been
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The company's affiliation with the Unification Church is unclear.
Several businesspeople in Seoul said it is part of the church, although
company officials said it is merely owned by individuals who are church
members, including Park, who owns about 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "This really has nothing to do with religion, and the fact that our
president is a member of the church doesn't affect the way the company
does business," said Lee Hyun Tak, a Pyonghwa official.</TE>

<HD>Massacre in France Stokes Debate</HD>
<DH>Europe: Violent crime was already the top issue in the presidential
campaign. Rival candidates rush to scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>France reacted with horror Wednesday to a massacre in a suburban
city hall in which police say a man killed eight city council members and
seriously wounded 14 other people--stoking a debate about violent crime,
which was already the top issue in the presidential campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Richard Durn, a volunteer member of a human rights
group who often attended council sessions. Police say Durn rose from the
public gallery and opened fire with two semiautomatic pistols after a
meeting ended at 1:11 a.m. Wednesday in Nanterre, a suburb of 87,000
people west of Paris.</LD>
<LD>   During a struggle with officials, who threw a chair at him and tried
to grab his guns, the assailant kept firing with his free hand, witnesses
said. They said that when he was subdued, the gunman shouted: "Kill me!
Kill me!"</LD>
<TE>   Durn, 33, had no criminal record and had a license for the guns,
according to police. He was unemployed, lived with his mother and was
taking medication for an undisclosed psychiatric condition, police said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother told journalists that her son had been undergoing
psychiatric treatment since 1990 and talked repeatedly about an urge to
kill.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, there was no clear motive for the rampage, which claimed
victims from across the political spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and conservative President
Jacques Chirac, rivals in next month's election, both rushed to the
bloodstained council chambers in the pyramid-shaped city hall. The city
is governed, as are many working-class suburbs here, by an alliance of
leftist parties.</TE>
<TE>   "These acts cannot be described as human . . . and everything must be
done to repress and prevent them," Chirac said.</TE>
<TE>   Another presidential candidate, Alain Madelin, said the killing spree
exemplified French society's dangerous drift toward "American-style
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Although France has far less violent crime than the United States, it
is the top concern of French voters, according to a recent survey by the
polling company Ipsos.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond a steady statistical increase in crime, the French have been
shocked by acts of unprecedented viciousness. Headlines speak of brazen
cop-killers, gang rapists prowling housing projects, and schoolyard
extortionists.</TE>
<TE>   The Nanterre rampage was the third and most terrifying such mass
shooting in eight months.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin said the government has worked to restrict access to guns "by
violent and fragile souls or criminals." However, the prime minister
cautioned against using the case as a political weapon, warning: "It is
always extremely difficult to prevent an act of madness. Another problem
altogether are the guns obtained by gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the tragedy intensified debate about violence in this
prosperous society, which prides itself on generous public benefits
intended to prevent U.S.-style inequality and social tension.</TE>
<TE>   Police in recent months have held demonstrations to protest legal
reforms, which officers say encourage assaults on police, firefighters
and other symbols of authority.</TE>
<TE>   Accounts on Wednesday suggested that Durn was a tormented loner
looking for a political cause.</TE>
<TE>   He had applied for a job at city hall, according to municipal
officials. He was volunteer treasurer of the Nanterre chapter of the
League for the Rights of Man, according to the president of that human
rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   Although authorities said Durn had no record, they also reported that
he had been involved in an incident four years ago in which he threatened
the staff of a medical office at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Before the shooting, Durn sat by himself through a sparsely attended,
six-hour budget session, witnesses said. The tall, brown-haired man
apparently was calm and talked to a few people, Interior Minister Daniel
Vaillant said.</TE>
<TE>   When the meeting ended, Durn advanced in silence down the aisle toward
the seats of the council members as he unleashed a 50-shot barrage,
according to Ghislaine Quilin, a mayoral aide who dived for cover.</TE>
<TE>   "He was shooting in every direction," Quilin told reporters. "Several
of us were hit, and then he started to come forward and systematically
kill every official who was in his path. I was lucky because I was on the
left of the chamber and he started from the right."</TE>
<TE>   The dead, four men and four women, ranged in age from 30 to 58. The
victims were four members of the French Communist Party, three members of
a center-right party and a representative of the Greens.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that in his statements after his arrest and in a letter
found at his home, Durn expressed disgust with his life and his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions Wednesday indicated that the crime issue will now play an
even bigger role in the close race leading up to the first round of the
presidential election April 21.</TE>
<TE>   In comments on national television, Toulouse Mayor Philippe
Douste-Blazy declared that the time had come for politicians to do more
than talk.</TE>
<TE>   Douste-Blazy, a center-right Chirac supporter, spoke from personal
experience: While culture minister in 1997, he survived a stabbing attack
by a deranged assailant who had stalked him for five years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to stop the hypocrisy," Douste-Blazy said. "That's enough:
The left, the center, the right. . . . There's been an explosion of
violence. It's horrible."</TE>

<HD>Motley Cast Wins Russian Broadcast License</HD>
<DH>Media: Crew includes Kremlin critic whose views have softened. Move
is seen as bid to end charge that Putin is stifling independent TV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>In what is widely seen as a Kremlin-orchestrated effort to end
Russia's unseemly media wars, the country's Press Ministry granted a
broadcast license Wednesday to a mix-and-match consortium of Kremlin
critics and supporters.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution--if it is one--appears inspired less by King Solomon
than Dr. Frankenstein: It splices together an award-winning journalist, a
former Soviet spymaster and a motley crew of oligarchs with little in
common except an apparent desire to quell criticism that the Kremlin is
stifling independent media.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the competition was honest," said Yevgeny M. Primakov, former
prime minister and Soviet foreign intelligence chief, who helped cobble
together the winning tender. "What we need to do now is to put together a
team that will be public and global in the full sense of the
word--without pressure from the government, without pressure from the
oligarchs, without any pressure at all."</LD>
<TE>   The winners are fronted by controversial TV anchorman Yevgeny
Kiselyov, once the Kremlin's harshest critic, who in recent weeks and
days has seemed uncharacteristically compliant. Formerly Russia's leading
journalist, Kiselyov has been dethroned twice in the last year--first
from the country's leading independent network, NTV, and a second time
from a smaller station, TV6, where he had taken shelter with many of his
former colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "On the outside, the situation looks rather funny," said Pavel I.
Voshchanov, a political analyst and former presidential spokesman. "The
authorities ended up with something they had been trying very hard to get
rid of--the Kiselyov team is back on the air. But this is only a
superficial impression. Although everything looks the same on the
outside, on the inside everything has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Kremlin officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, have
insisted that they had nothing to do with the financial and legal
maneuverings that led to the downfall of NTV last year and of TV6 in
January.</TE>
<TE>   But few in Russia doubt that the government entities that led the
campaigns--the gas monopoly Gazprom in the case of NTV and the Press
Ministry in the case of TV6--were operating at the Kremlin's behest. Both
TV companies were owned by oligarchs who were not-so-subtly denounced by
Putin as exerting unwelcome influence over their media holdings: Vladimir
A. Gusinsky and Boris A. Berezovsky.</TE>
<TE>   Observers noted that since Gusinsky and Berezovsky owned most of the
influential non-state media, any attack on their holdings was an attack
on independent journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind Media-Sotsium, as the new consortium is called,
apparently was designed to demonstrate that the target was not Kiselyov
by finding a way to put him back on the air without the financial backing
of Gusinsky and Berezovsky. The consortium members are supposed to
represent diverse views and financial interests, part of an effort to
keep Kiselyov and his team from being beholden to any of them.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium's senior figure is Primakov. In 1999, when the
leadership of the Kremlin was in contention, Primakov was seen as Putin's
toughest challenger--until his chances were destroyed by a smear campaign
on the Kremlin-backed ORT network.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Primakov's political movement has mellowed into a soft,
pro-Kremlin centrism. He apparently was seen as an adequately neutral
public figure to lead the nonprofit consortium, despite his frequent
diatribes at reporters whom he considers disloyal or unseemly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's widely known how [Primakov] feels about journalists," said
Andrei Norkin, a former NTV anchorman who put in one of more than a dozen
bids for the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The business side of the winning consortium is headed by Arkady I.
Volsky, chairman of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, a Kremlin-endorsed group of business leaders. Since Putin
has been in office, the union has been seen as a Kremlin vehicle to
dilute and restrain the power of the oligarchs.</TE>
<TE>   Media-Sotsium won the tender by a unanimous vote by a panel appointed
by the Press Ministry. Panel member Manana Aslamazyan, director of
Internews, a nongovernmental organization that supports independent mass
media, said that despite the apparent consensus, members debated long and
hard before voting because they felt indirectly manipulated by the
Kremlin.</TE>
<TE>   "What triggered the doubts in our heads was how the merger of a group
of journalists and a group of oligarchs under the supervision of
pro-government people very loyal to the authorities could work,"
Aslamazyan said afterward. "Isn't there a great threat to the
independence of journalists? Will they not be made to do something that
would go counter to their convictions and their beliefs?"</TE>
<TE>   Many observers suggested that the consortium, like other marriages of
convenience, may soon be strained.</TE>
<TE>   "For the oligarchs, the tender was by no means a business enterprise.
They have their other businesses, which they use to make money," said
Norkin. "So it must be all about politics. And this means that a new
attempt will be made to turn journalists into a political tool."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov in The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The State Department issued a terrorist alert for Italy because of
a "possible threat" by extremist groups to U.S. citizens there,
especially in Venice, Florence, Milan and Verona. The alert takes effect
immediately and applies particularly to Easter weekend, although it
extends through April 25, department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The alert advises Americans to increase their awareness and avoid
large crowds.</LD>
<LD>   "Civilian targets may include facilities where Americans and the
general public are usually known to congregate or visit, such as clubs,
restaurants, places of worship, schools or outdoor recreation events,"
the statement said.</LD>

<HD>Hundreds of Taliban Fighters Set Free</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Bedraggled ex-inmates say they were forced by the old
regime to serve, and now support the new government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Dirty, disheveled and contrite, the thin men sat on their haunches
on the pavement with vacant looks, waiting for a handout. But these were
not ordinary beggars. They were former Taliban fighters, released from
Sheberghan prison in the north of the country and slowly making their way
home.</LD>
<LD>   A few short months ago, they were part of a swaggering religious army
that breathed defiance of America and pledged a duel to the death with
the world's only superpower. Today, all the wind has gone out of them.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps that explains why, without fanfare, Afghanistan's new
government has started freeing batches of 100 or 200 of its Afghan
Taliban prisoners, who were captured or surrendered late last year in the
closing days of the U.S.-led military campaign to rid the country of the
extremist Islamic regime.</LD>
<TE>   Looking tired and somewhat dazed, bedraggled men like these have been
limping back home to their villages in the south of the country around
the Taliban strongholds of Kandahar and Helmand since February. They bear
an air of ignominy. To anyone who asks, they insist that they never
wanted to fight, did not fire their guns and of course would never march
off to fight in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I only plan to sit in my house, to serve my family and to remain
resting there for the rest of my life," said Mohammed Aref, 18, a freed
prisoner barely able to sprout a beard and sporting a mop of spiky black
hair that looked as if it had been cut in prison with a meat cleaver.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 5,800 prisoners of war and security detainees remain
imprisoned across Afghanistan at 46 known places of detention, said
Caroline Douillez, the spokeswoman here for the International Committee
of the Red Cross. She added that there could be still others whom the
organization has not yet found.</TE>
<TE>   The men have been questioned to determine their names and nationality
and whether they were hard-core members of the Taliban or its allied Al
Qaeda terrorist network--or simply ordinary soldiers who were seduced or
forced into the regime's campaign of jihad, or holy war.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, U.S. interrogators photographed them, took thumbprints
and cut samples of their hair, presumably to identify them positively and
get DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Sheberghan, near the Turkmenistan border, is the largest and most
notorious of the prisons for Taliban inmates and had held 3,500 men since
November in space designed for only about a third that number.</TE>
<TE>   The released inmates said they had suffered from bitter cold in the
prison and rations of plain rice that were too meager to fill their
bellies, but they also said they had experienced little overt brutality
or cruelty inside its walls.</TE>
<TE>   They were ordered freed last week on the occasion of Nowruz, the
traditional Persian new year. Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai and
Deputy Defense Minister Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord, announced
in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif that the government had agreed to
free about 300 prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they won't repeat their mistakes," Karzai said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The releases from Sheberghan took place Friday and Saturday, said the
Red Cross' Douillez, whose organization takes the lead in registering and
monitoring prisoners of war and conflicts worldwide. The group also helps
prisoners to travel back home to their families after they are freed.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Sheberghan prisoners, that included giving them
clean clothes and slippers for their journey.</TE>
<TE>   Aref and fellow former prisoner Mohammed Ghani said they had no good
reason to explain why they were released when so many others are still
locked up at Sheberghan. Perhaps because they did not have long beards,
Aref suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Aref denied that he had even been a true Taliban supporter. "I did not
get any benefit from them during the past four years," he said. "Now it
is good--Afghanistan has been freed, and we have our freedom."</TE>
<TE>   The group of about 150 former prisoners showed up unexpectedly Tuesday
morning at Red Cross headquarters here in Kabul, the capital, piling off
the back of an open truck.</TE>
<TE>   According to Douillez, the money they had been given by Red Cross
representatives in Sheberghan--500,000 Afghanis, or about $16--had run
out when they were still only about halfway to their destinations. So
they turned to the Red Cross in Kabul, pleading for enough to go the rest
of the way. Within a few hours, the problem was resolved, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The former prisoners appeared gaunt, and many complained of lingering
health problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I have sore feet. I cannot walk well anymore," said Ghani, who gave
his age as 30 but appeared far older, with salt and pepper in his
scraggly beard. By his account, he and other residents of his village had
been press-ganged into the Taliban army about two months before his unit
surrendered to Dostum's forces in late November.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani gave a harrowing account of the first days after his unit's
surrender. He said he and 200 other Taliban fighters were squeezed into a
metal container and left there for three nights without water or food in
freezing temperatures. By the time the container was opened, Ghani said,
only about 50 of them were still alive.</TE>
<TE>   Aref said that if someone back home invites him to fight to revive the
Taliban movement, he will not agree. "I will tell them that it is not a
good thing to fight against this government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani agreed, toying with a plastic bracelet on his pale ankle that
had been put there by the Americans with a prisoner number--56-E.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Draws a Line on Hunt for Bin Laden</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The government of Pakistan said Wednesday it was confident that
Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar were not in the
country, and it would not allow U.S. troops to look for them here.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said in an interview that Pakistan
had good control of its border with Afghanistan and good cooperation with
the semiautonomous tribesmen living there.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, neither Bin Laden, blamed by Washington for the Sept. 11
attacks on the United States, nor Omar, his former Afghan host, could
have found refuge in Pakistan, he said, rebutting suggestions that U.S.
troops might need to cross into Pakistan to look for them or their
supporters.</LD>
<TE>   "The Pakistani tribesmen living on this side of the Pakistan-Afghan
border are very clear. They are cooperating with us, and they are acting
in a very responsible manner. They will not like to take the risk of
harboring anybody, not at all."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, a key partner in the U.S.-led war on terrorism in
neighboring Afghanistan, has fanned out troops along its long western
border, which winds through rugged mountains, to keep out fighters from
Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and the toppled Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "After 22 long years, we have very effective control of our western
border," Haider said, adding that the army had established 300
checkpoints in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "So we are very confident on this issue, and I don't think they [Bin
Laden or Omar] can find a refuge here."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, two U.S. senators visiting troops in Afghanistan said some
Al Qaeda fighters had fled to Pakistan and raised the possibility of
putting U.S. forces on the border to block others.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, ranking Republican on
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told reporters, "I am hoping
that the government of Pakistan is going to join us in a big way to rid
the border of . . . the Al Qaeda who would use Pakistan as a sanctuary."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said the United
States had not asked to deploy troops on the Pakistani side of the border
to prevent such escapes.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither they have requested nor will we allow this," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf "has already said . . . there is
no need for any forces to cross over," Haider said. "We are quite well
organized, we are quite effective, we are our watch, on high alert."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters in Washington on
Monday that he had no plans to send U.S. troops across the Afghan border
into Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told a daily briefing
Wednesday: "We're cooperating very closely. I'm sure, should any
particular situation arise, we would be able to resolve it and maintain
security together with the government of Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "I'm sure the military people and perhaps others have
had some discussion, but . . . the confidence that we have that any
particular situation would be dealt with appropriately, I think, has not
yet really been tested."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani troops are believed to have captured hundreds of suspected
Al Qaeda members fleeing U.S. airstrikes on the Tora Bora region in
Afghanistan in December.</TE>
<TE>   Haider said they had rounded up hundreds of Pakistanis who had been
fighting alongside the Taliban and had fled home.</TE>
<TE>   "Each one now is being thoroughly investigated," he said.</TE>

<HD>Excerpts of Speech on the Saudi Initiative</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is an excerpt of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's speech at a
summit in Beirut proposing a new Arab peace initiative. Associated Press
translated the speech, which was delivered in Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   I thank the fraternal country of Lebanon . . . for hosting this summit
at this critical and turbulent juncture in history in which events are
unfolding. . . .</LD>
<LD>   Those who follow the intifada of our brothers in Palestine, which has
the support of all Arabs and Muslims, realize that steadfastness will not
wither, that bravery will not retreat, and that right will prevail. . . .
It is therefore incumbent on the Israeli government to realize this [that
Palestinians will continue their struggle] and to try to avoid it by
following another path, that is the path of peace.</LD>
<TE>   It has been clear in our minds . . . that the only acceptable
objective of the peace process is a full Israeli withdrawal from all
occupied Arab territories, the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with [East Jerusalem] as its capital and the return of
refugees. Without achieving this objective, the peace process becomes a
waste of time, a play on words and merely maneuvers that perpetuate the
cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   I tell the Israeli people that if their government gives up the policy
of force and suppression and accepts genuine peace, we will not hesitate
in accepting the Israeli people's right to live in security with the rest
of the people in the region.</TE>
<TE>   . . . I propose that the Arab League put forward a clear and
collective initiative to the United Nations Security Council based on two
basic issues: normal relations and security for Israel in exchange for
full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, recognition of an
independent Palestinian state with [East Jerusalem] as its capital, and
the return of refugees. At the same time, I appeal to all friendly
countries throughout the world to support this noble humanitarian
proposal. . . .</TE>
<TE>   God's peace and blessing be upon you.</TE>

<HD>Rebels Losing Their Edge in Colombia's Civil War</HD>
<DH>Conflict: The fighting appears to be at a deadlock a month after
peace talks' collapse. The guerrillas face stronger, better-equipped
foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>A month after peace talks collapsed, this is what Colombia's war
looks like:</LD>
<LD>   In the countryside, leftist guerrillas have demolished bridges,
detonated car bombs and killed soldiers and police in small groups. In
the cities, people go on Sunday bike rides, dine at fine restaurants and
attend fashion shows.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, the war looks pretty much the same as it did before
Feb. 20, when President Andres Pastrana ended negotiations with the
country's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<TE>   Despite predictions, the end of talks has not produced a blood bath.
Instead, more than three years after a devastating series of rebel
victories prompted the talks, there is growing evidence that the
guerrillas have lost their military advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The Colombian military is stronger, with more troops and better
equipment. The country's right-wing paramilitary groups have turned into
a powerful enemy. And the U.S.-supported battle against cocaine
production and trafficking has cut into the rebels' primary source of
revenue, analysts believe.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the war is at a deadlock. The rebels seem to be
positioning themselves for an eventual return to talks rather than
national conquest, launching hit-and-run attacks against political
figures and infrastructure to improve their negotiating position.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take much blood, much destruction and thousands of
dead. Then the talks will start again," said Armando Borrero, a former
national security chief.</TE>
<TE>   There is a ray of hope: Negotiations with a smaller rebel group, the
National Liberation Army, or ELN, have improved. Both sides are examining
the possibility of a truce in coming months. The ELN, thought to number
fewer than 5,000 rebels, has been devastated by paramilitary attacks.</TE>
<TE>Fears of a Blood Bath So Far Seem Unfounded</TE>
<TE>   The end of the peace talks with the FARC, which is more than three
times the size of the ELN, has not produced a massive surge in casualties
in Colombia's internal conflict, which has simmered since 1964. Fighting
this year between the military and rebels has killed about 40 combatants
a week, up from last year's average of about 26 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have the rebels been able so far to unleash a promised wave of
attacks against cities, where more than 70% of the population lives.
Military and police have detained dozens of alleged urban guerrillas. The
federal prosecutor's office has conducted nationwide raids, seizing
dynamite and bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC, made up mostly of impoverished, uneducated peasants, has so
far been unable to mount complex operations that would suggest its
fighters are ready for the urban warfare necessary to take control of
Bogota, the capital, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "They are historically weak in the cities," said Adam Isacson, the
Colombia analyst for the Center for International Policy, a center-left
think tank based in Washington. "I don't think they have that capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Even in rural areas, both rebel groups have had difficulty asserting
the dominance they once showed. Congressional elections held March 10
went smoothly in all but 15 of the more than 1,000 counties nationwide, a
major achievement considering that the two groups control an estimated
40% of rural areas and the FARC had demanded a boycott.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means that the rebels are on the verge of defeat. Their
ubiquitous presence and proven ability to destroy infrastructure have
frustrated the military. The result is a stalemate, say officials and
analysts, with no side able to dominate and years of bloodshed ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorism is an endemic disease," said Gen. Fernando Tapias, the
armed forces chief. "It cannot be totally eliminated, but we can cut down
the levels of destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The standoff has changed the character of the war. In the late 1990s,
the FARC had grown strong enough to attack army bases and cities in
sustained operations with hundreds of fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels wiped out an elite counter-guerrilla battalion outside the
southern town of El Billar during a two-day battle in March 1998, killing
107 of the unit's 154 soldiers. In November that year, as Pastrana was
preparing to hand over a demilitarized zone to the rebels as a prelude to
talks, hundreds of FARC rebels overran Mitu, a regional capital in
eastern Colombia, killing 150 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the rebels have had trouble mounting such logistically
complicated operations, thanks in part to U.S. military hardware and
satellite intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, an elite Colombian strike force of about 5,000 soldiers
transported by U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters routed a column of about
1,000 rebels who were trying to recapture a crucial
drug-and-arms-smuggling corridor in a remote corner of southeastern
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels also face a better-paid, better-trained army. The number of
professional soldiers in the 140,000-member military has more than
doubled, from 20,000 to 50,000, in the last three years. The rest are
draftees who by law are not allowed into combat situations. The army
plans to add 10,000 more soldiers each year for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides got stronger during the past three years. But the army
strengthened themselves more," said Mauricio Silva, an analyst who has
written about the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the rebels in small squads have returned to hitting
police and military outposts, then fleeing into the jungle. On March 12,
army officials accused the guerrillas of detonating a car bomb near a
police station in a town about 100 miles south of Bogota, killing three
soldiers and four civilians.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the FARC has stepped up sabotage attempts, launching
attacks against vulnerable targets: railroad tracks, bridges, roads and
electrical towers in the countryside. Guerrillas blew up more than 143
transmission towers through the beginning of this month, compared with
254 for all of last year.</TE>
<TE>Politicians Among Those Being Targeted</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have also made it clear that they plan to kidnap political
figures, even those who have previously shown sympathy for leftist
causes. Only days after the peace process ended, guerrillas kidnapped
Ingrid Betancourt, an independent whose fight against Bogota's political
machinery mirrored FARC complaints about the country's entrenched
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "The FARC have returned to being guerrillas," said Alfredo Rangel, a
military consultant. "They are seeking to strengthen themselves in
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   The motive seems clear. Such attacks target both politicians and
ordinary people, increasing pressure for negotiations. One key point in
coming months will be presidential elections in May. The FARC may stage a
show of force then to intimidate the incoming president.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few who expect talks to begin soon. Hard-liner Alvaro
Uribe, the front-runner, has said he will not negotiate unless the FARC
stops the kidnapping, extortion and violence it uses to finance its
operations.</TE>
<TE>   After three fruitless years of talks, the country seems in no mood for
a return to the table.</TE>
<TE>   "How long will it take? How much blood will be spilled? Who knows? But
eventually, we will get back to the peace process. Neither side can
defeat the other," said Antonio Navarro, a senator and former member of
the M-19 guerrilla group, which signed a peace accord with the government
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Military analysts attribute the change in the FARC's tactics to
serious internal and external challenges. Its membership has shot up in
numbers, jumping from about 7,000 in 1995 to an estimated 17,000 today.
The fighters also have spread from their base in eastern Colombia to
operate in every department, or state, in mainland Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   That growth has required more money at a time when attacks against
FARC financing seem to be bearing fruit. A U.S. State Department report
recently found that aerial fumigation in Colombia, performed by U.S.
contractors, has sharply cut back the cultivation of coca, the plant used
to make cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Gustavo Socha, the head of Colombia's anti-narcotics unit,
estimated that the drop has resulted in millions of dollars in lost
revenue for the rebels, who tax coca production and have become more
directly involved in production and trafficking over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC has also become increasingly besieged by paramilitary forces,
which have grown from a few hundred fighters in the 1980s to more than
10,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitary forces--which boast of fighting the guerrillas like
guerrillas, conducting lightning raids and massacres--have sealed off
large areas along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and on the borders with
Venezuela and Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   That in turn has hurt the guerrillas' ability to move drugs and
weapons. Recent military intelligence reports indicate that rebels have
begun to reduce the number of bullets they issue to fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is some evidence that the FARC is having problems
gaining and retaining recruits. Defections have increased. And there are
anecdotal accounts of a jump in forced recruitment of teenagers as more
and more rural youths flee to cities in search of jobs and an escape from
violence.</TE>
<TE>   "What I most worry about is that FARC are increasing their forced
recruitment, like all sides are," said Edgar Florez, the director in
Colombia for World Vision, a U.S.-based Christian group that works to
protect children. "It is very troubling for us."</TE>

<LD>Venezuela formally protested to Colombia on Wednesday what it
called a "malicious" Colombian army report that left-wing guerrillas were
operating from a base in Venezuelan territory.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomatic protest note, which was delivered to the Colombian
Embassy in Caracas, rejected allegations made last week by a Colombian
army general who said Marxist rebels had crossed from Venezuela to attack
Colombian troops.</LD>
<LD>   Venezuelan Foreign Minister Luis Alfonso Davila, who read the note at
a news conference in Caracas, the capital, said the Colombian authorities
were not doing enough to halt the spillover of violence and
drug-trafficking activities across the 1,380-mile border between the
neighboring Andean nations.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement last week, Colombian army Gen. Martin Orlando Carreno
said rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its
Spanish initials FARC, used a base inside Venezuela to lob gas cylinders
at his troops and as a launching ground for hit-and-run attacks.</TE>

<HD>Citizenship Pulled, Ex-Premier Says</HD>
<DH>Africa: Ian D. Smith, Zimbabwe's last white leader, claims he is
now stateless. Government official denies the charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The nation's last white leader, former Prime Minister Ian D. Smith,
said Wednesday that the government stripped him of his Zimbabwean
citizenship and passport.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 82, the prime minister of Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known
before independence in 1980, said authorities in Harare refused to renew
his passport, leaving him stateless.</LD>
<LD>   "They have canceled my nationality. It is illegal, and I'm not going
to let them get away with it," Smith said by telephone from his home in
Harare, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   Smith said officials at the Harare passport office refused to meet
with him after informing him that his passport was not being renewed
ahead of a scheduled trip to Britain and the United States next week.</TE>
<TE>   Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo denied that the government had
stripped Smith of his citizenship, saying he was free to stay in Zimbabwe
pending the normalization of his citizenship status.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the laws of Zimbabwe, if one or both parents are born
outside the country, you need to renounce your right to the citizenship
of their country of birth," Nkomo said. "I understand he has not done
that yet. He can still do that, but while he is doing that he is not
entitled to a Zimbabwean passport."</TE>
<TE>   Several appellate cases on citizenship rights are pending in the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, whose father was a wealthy Scottish immigrant, was born in
Rhodesia and headed the white minority government after his Rhodesia
Front Party severed ties with Britain, the former colonial power, in
1965.</TE>
<TE>   He said he renounced claims to British citizenship in 1984 but did not
renounce again last year under new rules passed by President Robert
Mugabe's ruling party that ban dual citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, even those who did not possess foreign passports
were required to renounce all rights to foreign nationality. By ignoring
it, Smith was still entitled to British nationality through his
British-born father.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the government said the stricter rules were intended to
frighten whites worried about their future status in Zimbabwe during a
violent campaign to seize white-owned farms that erupted before June 2000
elections and continued amid a presidential ballot this month.</TE>
<TE>   The government said at least 5,000 whites who retained foreign
citizenship rights were disqualified from voting in the March 9-11
election.</TE>
<TE>   About 60,000 whites comprise less than half a percent of the nation's
13 million people.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he was able to cast his vote in the poll using a national
identity card showing him as a citizen born in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe was declared the winner against opposition leader Morgan
Tsvangirai, amid political violence and allegations of vote rigging.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe has frequently said that he left Smith free to live in the
country and tolerated his criticisms of the government as part of his
reconciliation policy.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A South Korean presidential envoy is scheduled to visit Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, next week for at least three days of meetings
intended to restart the stalled dialogue between the estranged Koreas,
the government here confirmed today.</LD>
<LD>   The government said envoy Lim Dong Won would travel to the North on
Wednesday. South and North Korea had said Monday that high-level
negotiations would resume early next month.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, South Korea's official news agency reported that State
Department envoy Charles Pritchard and North Korea's U.N. ambassador, Pak
Gil Yon, had met twice in New York since mid-March to clear the way for
talks.</LD>
<TE>   Those meetings were the first formal contacts since President Bush
characterized North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" in January.</TE>
<TE>   In another effort to break out of its diplomatic isolation, Pyongyang
will play host to Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri for a
three-day visit. Megawati, who arrives today, met North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il as a child when their fathers were the leaders of their
respective nations.</TE>

<DL>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka
</DL>
<LD>Face-to-face talks with rebels aimed at ending an 18-year civil war
will start in the first week of May, the government announced Wednesday,
although the guerrillas said their outlaw status must be lifted before
they will participate.</LD>
<LD>   "Face-to-face discussions can be expected in the first week of May,"
government spokesman G.L. Peiris said. "Both sides agree that the time is
opportune to commence negotiations."</LD>
<LD>   "All prerequisites for talks will be considered, other than the demand
for a separate state--which is not negotiable," Peiris said.</LD>
<TE>   Hopes for peace brightened after the government and the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is fighting for a separate state for the
ethnic Tamil minority, signed a cease-fire accord Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The government and the rebels agreed to resume discussions over ending
the war, which has claimed more than 64,000 lives.</TE>
<TE>   A Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam statement on the Internet did not
announce the May date, but it did not contradict it. The group said it
was committed to the truce.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he would consider lifting
the ban on the Tigers if he got an honest commitment from the rebels to
help end the war.</TE>
<TE>   The government announcement came after crucial closed-door discussions
Tuesday among reclusive rebel leader Vellupilai Prabhakaran, rebel
negotiator Anton Balasingham, rebel political wing leader S.P.
Thamilselvan and a top Norwegian delegation.</TE>
<TE>   The London-based Balasingham arrived on the island Monday, after an
absence of three years, in a bid to boost the peace process and draw the
two sides closer to the negotiating table, government officials and rebel
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The government is looking for a venue in neighboring nations for the
talks.</TE>

<HD>Serbia Fleshes Out Decree on U.N. Court</HD>
<DH>Justice: Government adopts a measure regulating cooperation with
war crimes tribunal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>The government of Serbia adopted a measure Wednesday regulating
cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal as a U.S.-imposed deadline
looms for Belgrade to prove that it is working with the court.</LD>
<LD>   Cedomir Jovanovic, parliamentary leader of the ruling Democratic
Opposition of Serbia reform alliance, said the move put more flesh on the
bones of a decree passed last year that was used as the legal basis for
handing former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over to the tribunal
in The Hague.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, a constitutional court judge was quoted as saying the
original decree was set to be ruled invalid, which could raise fresh
questions on the legality of Milosevic's transfer.</LD>
<TE>   It also could open the way for a legal challenge to the new measure
just as Yugoslavia and Serbia, its dominant republic, are under pressure
to show signs of cooperation with the tribunal or face a freeze in
financial aid from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. legislation, about $40 million from the United States
earmarked for Serbia will be suspended after March 31 if the Bush
administration has not certified that Belgrade has passed a series of
tests, including assisting the U.N. court.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline has prompted widespread speculation that Serbian
officials will soon hand over at least one suspect wanted by the
tribunal, although the move would be unpopular with many Serbs, who see
the court as biased against them.</TE>
<TE>   Jovanovic appealed to indictees, who include former senior government
and army members, to surrender to the tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise, they should not expect us to put their interests before
those of the state," he told reporters in Belgrade, the Yugoslav and
Serbian capital.</TE>
<TE>   A government statement said the new decision stipulated that Serbian
state bodies should observe the tribunal's rules and procedures when
cooperating with the Hague court until a domestic law on the issue is
passed.</TE>
<TE>   The Tanjug state news agency quoted constitutional court Judge Momcilo
Grubac as saying that his court had adopted a decision quashing last
year's decree but that it had not yet been finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that the text of the decision was examined at a meeting of
the Federal Constitutional Court, but this is not yet a final decision,"
Grubac said, according to Tanjug.</TE>

<LD>Radio penalty--A story in Friday's Calendar about indecency on the
radio incorrectly gave the impression that a financial penalty levied in
an Alaska civil suit against the distributor of the syndicated Tom Leykis
talk show was the result of comments Leykis made on the air. In fact, a
jury ordered the company, Westwood One, to pay $150,000 to the plaintiff
for having failed to turn over a broadcast tape requested as evidence.
The jury ruled against the plaintiff on charges that Leykis' comments
about her had caused her emotional distress and violated her privacy.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Seeks to Reopen Area to Off-Roaders</HD>
<DH>Desert: Plan would overturn Clinton decision that curbed
use of sand dunes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government wants to overturn key parts of a Clinton-era
decision that helped preserve a large patch of desert dunes in
southeastern California, a move that would reopen thousands of acres
to off-road vehicles, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Bureau of Land Management declined to discuss the new
plan in detail. But several officials said it would allow at least
limited off-road vehicle access to thousands of acres in the Imperial
Sand Dunes Recreation Area where off-road vehicles are currently
banned.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal will be announced today or Friday, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Roy Denner, a Lakeside resident who sits on two citizen panels
that advise the BLM on use of the desert, said the proposal would
reopen 15,000 acres to off-road vehicle use with no limitations.
Another chunk of land, he said, as many as 35,000 acres, could be
opened with strict limits on the number of riders each day--probably
about 500. The plan--a draft, subject to a 90-day public comment
period once it is released--is expected to become official by the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the plan has enraged conservationists, who thought their
campaign to control dust pollution and preserve sensitive plants and
animals, many of which can survive only in the dunes, had been won.</TE>
<TE>   The new plan would trump portions of a November 2000 legal
agreement between the BLM and a group of environmentalists who filed
a federal lawsuit largely to protect a rare plant they said was being
decimated by off-road vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement banned off-road vehicles on 49,000 acres of the
recreation area. Those curbs were seen as temporary until the BLM
enacted a permanent plan to manage the site. This new proposal is
part of that plan, which conservationists say will render the legal
settlement moot.</TE>
<TE>   "They are basically reopening the dunes," said Kristen Brengel,
campaign manager for the Washington-based Natural Trails and Waters
Coalition, a consortium of about 90 environmental organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "It just amazes me," she said. "This is one of the most precious
places in Southern California.... We need to preserve it so it's
there for future generations to enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Harrison, press secretary for Rep. Duncan Hunter
(R-Alpine), a congressman who has been closely involved in the
preparation of the proposal, said the federal government is merely
taking "a common-sense approach to solving environmental concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Staed, deputy director of communications for the Bureau of
Land Management in Sacramento, said the BLM is fighting hard to
please all sides in what has become a fierce battle over the public's
right to use public land as it sees fit.</TE>
<TE>   "The bureau is trying to work out acceptable use of the desert to
all parties concerned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that's a wide-open statement. We are doing our best....
It's trying to achieve that balance that is so critical. I think we
can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison and off-road enthusiasts made it clear Wednesday that
they had hoped to eliminate portions of the 18-month-old settlement
as soon as President Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clinton administration was very, very far to the extreme
environmental position," said Denner, who is president and chief
executive of a trade association of companies that cater to off-road
vehicle enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the new administration is swinging the pendulum all
the way in the other direction," he said. "The new administration has
opened the door to reasonable and balanced land management practices.
We do not want the right to run off-highway vehicles helter- skelter
all over public lands. But neither do we want to be closed out. And
that's where the Clinton administration was heading."</TE>
<TE>   About 25 miles east of Brawley, the Imperial recreation area
stretches nearly 40 miles from the Chocolate Mountains to the Mexican
border, the largest dune formation in California. Some dunes rise
more than 300 feet off the desert floor, making them a suitable home
for hundreds of species of rare creatures and plants as well as a
desirable site for riders of dune buggies, Baja Bugs, motorcycles,
trucks and all-terrain vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Because the area is so big, so isolated and so arid--average
rainfall is about 2 inches a year and summer temperatures routinely
soar to 110 degrees--it is considered a unique habitat. Its many
plants and animals include the silver-leafed Algodones Dunes
sunflower and 12 species of beetle, ecologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Some weekends, as many as 200,000 off-road enthusiasts swarm the
dunes. Thanksgiving weekend, law enforcement officials reported a
stabbing, a fatal shooting, an attack on a ranger who had pulled
someone over for speeding, and dozens of crashes that caused 200
injuries and two deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the environmental concern centers on the Peirson's milk
vetch, an endangered plant that grows only in the Imperial Valley
desert.</TE>
<TE>   Off-road enthusiasts have hired their own biologists who they say
have shown that the plant is surviving quite well.</TE>
<TE>   And Harrison scoffed Wednesday at the environmentalists'
efforts--"all in purposes of saving a weed," he said.</TE>

we need to treat our land with respect. To just call it a weed and
just throw your hands up and say, 'Who cares?'--that's not the way
land should be managed. And that's not why Americans have laws in
place to protect land and endangered species."</TE>

<HD>Feds Seek Fast OK for Water Release</HD>
<DH>Klamath Basin: Decision to open irrigation gates Friday
gives biologists just days to provide data expected to say that fish
won't be threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton prepares for a Friday
ceremony opening the headgates to deliver water to drought-stricken
Klamath Basin farmers, federal biologists rushed this week to
establish legal grounds for Norton's action.</LD>
<LD>   Confident that biologists employed by the Interior Department
would support the water release, officials announced Wednesday that
Norton and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman would open the
headgates Friday morning</LD>
<LD>   Biologists with the department's Fish and Wildlife Service were
given only six days to determine that releasing the water in April
and May will not hurt endangered fish--an evaluation process that
normally can take up to four months under the U.S. Endangered Species
Act.</LD>
<TE>   For the release to be legal, the government biologists must affirm
that two endangered species of sucker fish will not be imperiled if
some of the water they live in is diverted to agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   A federal decision last year to divert water from farmers to fish
created a storm of criticism aimed at the Endangered Species Act, the
1973 law that protects animals, fish and plants in danger of
extinction. Many farmers lost crops and some declared bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The law is enforced by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Marine Fisheries Service, which must review how federal
actions will affect protected species.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been under pressure from
the Bush administration to ease protection of a number of rare
species, is expected to render an opinion today that will allow the
water to flow to the farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing this fast, faster than we normally would like to do,
because biologists like to go over things over and over," said Fish
and Wildlife spokeswoman Patricia Foulk. "But we feel this opinion
will be biologically sound."</TE>
<TE>   Foulk said more rain and a larger snowpack have made the water
shortage less serious than last year. She said the availability of
more water lessens the chance that the fish will be harmed during the
next two months.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason for the agency's confidence is that the Bureau of
Reclamation--the agency that regulates the flow of water in the
basin, which is dependent on irrigation--has agreed to install nets
and barriers to help prevent the sucker fish from being killed as
they are swept through the headgates or stranded in farm fields.</TE>
<TE>   Critics questioned why federal biologists are being given so
little time to study what has become the most controversial
irrigation project in the nation. The Fish and Wildlife opinion is to
be faxed to Washington this morning and signed this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "If this wasn't prejudging the outcome of the final opinion, I
don't know what it is," said Jamie Rappaport Clark, who was director
of the Fish and Wildlife Service from 1997 to 2001 and is now senior
vice president for conservation at the National Wildlife Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be very concerned about whether the biological needs
of the species have been politicized in their zeal to make a deal,"
said Clark, who added she has never heard of a biological opinion
turned around so quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was highly atypical," said a source within the Fish and
Wildlife Service, who said that the agency was given only four
business days to provide the opinion and that biologists were
required to work through the weekend. "Any time you do something in
four days, you cut a lot of corners."</TE>
<TE>   The National Marine Fisheries Service was also asked to conduct an
expedited review of the effects of the water diversion on threatened
coho salmon. The fisheries service concluded it did not have time for
the review, and instead plans to report that salmon are not likely to
be harmed.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-track reviews were requested as government officials,
farmers and environmentalists gear up for planting season in the
Klamath Basin straddling the Oregon-California border, site last
summer of one of the West's fiercest water battles in decades.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Reclamation requested the fast-track Fish and
Wildlife Service opinion in a letter dated March 22. Earlier, federal
officials had said that a section of the Endangered Species Act would
allow them to provide water to farmers starting April 1, even if the
biological reviews were not complete, but federal attorneys
questioned that view, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service's review of fish conditions last
year has been blamed for cutting off water to farmers and was
criticized by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ellen Wooldridge, Norton's deputy chief of staff, said
Wednesday that the fish and general conditions in the basin have
received considerable scientific scrutiny in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been informally consulting for months and months and
months," she said, adding that she doubted the Fish and Wildlife
Service would find that two months of water supplied to farmers would
threaten the sucker fish.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to look for all sorts of things we can do to
give the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries
Service comfort that they can allow the water to be managed in such a
way that they can allow the farmers" to receive water, she said.</TE>

<HD>Former LAPD Officer Pleads Guilty to Cocaine Trafficking</HD>
<DH>Crime: Ex-Rampart drug agent caught in sting faces 15-year
minimum and remains a suspect in murder, robberies and an on-duty
shooting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT and SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles police officer who once worked a narcotics
assignment in the troubled Rampart Division pleaded guilty Wednesday
to federal cocaine-trafficking charges.</LD>
<LD>   Ruben Palomares, 32, faces a minimum of 15 years in federal prison
for attempting to buy 10 kilograms of cocaine from agents with the
Drug Enforcement Administration during an undercover sting operation
in June, according to attorneys in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Palomares' guilty plea resolves his San Diego drug case, but his
legal problems are expected to continue in Los Angeles, attorneys
said. The former Golden Gloves boxer remains under investigation by
federal authorities in connection with a Huntington Park murder, an
on-duty police shooting and a string of home-invasion robberies.</LD>
<TE>   Dressed in a beige prison-issued jumpsuit, Palomares showed little
emotion during the brief hearing at which he pleaded guilty to two
drug-trafficking violations and one count of using a firearm in the
commission of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "In regards to his San Diego case, he's expressed remorse,
realizing that he had a terrible lapse of judgment," said Palomares'
attorney David H. Bartick. "He certainly realizes the severity of the
case."</TE>
<TE>   Bartick asked U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Whelan to postpone
Palomares' sentencing for several months because he said his client
is a target of a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles. The
judge scheduled Palomares' sentencing for July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Though Palomares admitted guilt in the San Diego case, Bartick
said outside court that his client was not involved in the Huntington
Park slaying, the home-invasion robberies or other crimes that may be
under investigation by federal authorities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Randy Jones said Palomares received no
special considerations in exchange for his guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence was very strong against him," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Palomares and four other men were arrested June 8 after they
allegedly bought 10 kilos of cocaine from undercover DEA agents in
Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Palomares, in an effort to avoid arrest, flashed his LAPD badge
and told the agents he was working on an undercover operation. He
recanted that a short time later and said he was off-duty. At the
time of his arrest Palomares was assigned to the LAPD's Northeast
Division.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Moon, one of the men arrested with Palomares that day,
immediately admitted involvement in the drug deal. He also implicated
Palomares in the murder of a young man in Huntington Park, and in a
string of drug rip-offs in the Los Angeles area. Moon also accused
another LAPD officer, William Ferguson, of being involved in some of
the robberies as well.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rico, Ferguson's attorney, said his client denies any
involvement in criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities and LAPD detectives have been investigating
Moon's claims for 10 months. According to sources familiar with the
probe, authorities are pursuing a racketeering case against
Palomares, Ferguson and others under the theory that the alleged
murder, robberies and perhaps other crimes were part of a continuing
criminal enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Perez, the former LAPD officer who launched what became
known as the Rampart corruption scandal with his admissions and
allegations of police crimes and misconduct, told investigators
shortly after he began cooperating in September 1999 that he thought
Palomares was a bad cop.</TE>
<TE>   Perez and Palomares were both assigned to Rampart in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   He said Palomares had intimated to him that he and a partner shot
an unarmed man during an encounter in a basement in the Rampart
Division in 1998 and then planted a gun on him to cover it up. That
shooting remains under investigation by the FBI and LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I would look at everything Palomares has done, every arrest that
he's made, and scrutinize it very carefully," Perez told
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   After Palomares' guilty plea Wednesday, LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks issued a statement, saying: "We must acknowledge that the
arrest and conviction of Palomares is a black eye to the law
enforcement profession. However, we must also acknowledge that the
vast majority of police officers ... conduct themselves with honor
and integrity in service to the community, and in their personal
lives."</TE>

<HD>Invention Led to Kidnapping, Prosecutor Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Businessman is accused of abducting partner to find
their missing RocketBelt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas man lured his former business partner to Los Angeles with the
promise of a job in the movies, then had him held against his will
for eight days, sometimes in a box, in an attempt to learn where he
had hidden their Buck Rogers-like RocketBelt, a prosecutor alleged
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Both the defendant, Thomas Laurence Stanley, and the victim,
Bradley Wayne Barker, are obsessed with the RocketBelt 2000, a
backpack-like device they developed that can lift a person into the
air, if just for a few seconds, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Korn said in
his opening statement.</LD>
<LD>   Stanley and Barker each invested three years and $94,000 in
designing and manufacturing the device, Stanley's attorney said.</LD>
<TE>   The obsession led Stanley, 57, of Sugarland, Texas, a Houston
suburb, to hire Christopher James Wentzel, 54, of North Hollywood to
kidnap and hold Barker until he agreed to release the belt, Korn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley and Wentzel, on trial in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, are charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and extortion.
If convicted, they face life in prison. They are now free on bail.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Dale R. Atherton, who represents Stanley, told jurors
that the defendants were acting as agents of a Fort Smith, Ark., bail
bonds company in detaining Barker in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Barker was out of jail on a $25,000 bond when he left Arkansas for
California. He was awaiting trial there for burglary, and was
expected to stay in Arkansas or Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But Korn, describing the events as an abduction, said Wentzel
urged Barker to come to Los Angeles for a studio job, which never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Barker went to Wentzel's North Hollywood house on Nov.
26, 1999, and was greeted by Wentzel and two other men.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing he knows, he's in a chokehold with a gun to his
head," Korn said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next eight days, Barker was held captive, at times in a
large box, and interrogated by his captors, who threatened to kill
him and harm his son, before escaping on Dec. 3, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the RocketBelt? Where's the RocketBelt?" Korn said the
men asked.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said he will show jurors e-mail messages from
Stanley to Wentzel during that time providing questions to ask
Barker.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a gun-toting Wentzel forced Barker, with one wrist
handcuffed to a chair, to sign an affidavit waiving his rights to the
RocketBelt, Korn said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Wentzel tells him, 'You are going to sign this thing or else
I'm going to blow your head off,'" Korn said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Atherton said the men's stormy relationship began
in 1991 when Barker approached Stanley about building the RocketBelt.
By 1994, while the device was being tested, the men fought over money
and control.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Barker did not want Mr. Stanley to fly the RocketBelt,"
Atherton said, saying that Barker became so obsessed with the device
that he refused to let others touch it and polished it while wearing
gloves.</TE>
<TE>   About that time, Stanley accused Barker of padding manufacturing
costs. Then, Barker set up a company with another Texan, Joe Wright,
that sued Stanley and won control of the RocketBelt. Stanley later
won a $10.2-million default judgment against Barker and possession of
the belt. He never got it.</TE>
<TE>   The belt has been missing since 1995, despite Stanley's efforts to
hunt it down, including an offer of a $10,000 reward for its
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Besides their legal dispute, Atherton told jurors, Barker once
assaulted Stanley with a hammer, cracking his skull, and stalked his
family.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man arrested on suspicion of murdering a girl in New
York in 1984 is fighting extradition, his lawyer said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel Pacheco, a 33-year-old personal trainer from Reseda,
appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pacheco, who maintains his innocence, will await a governor's
warrant from New York to force the extradition.</LD>
<TE>   Pacheco was arrested in Los Angeles on March 20 on an unrelated
child molestation case. Investigators served an arrest warrant on
Pacheco the next day in connection with the death of 11-year-old
Angela Wong in New York. Second-degree murder charges await him in
that case.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco is being held without bail and is to return to court April
22.</TE>

<HD>Late-Season Flu Bug Strikes</HD>
<DH>Health: An unexpected outbreak of Type B influenza has hit
many of county's elementary, middle school students in the last two
weeks.</DH>

<LD>It struck 8-year-old Shelby Cottey as she practiced writing cursive
and capital Gs for an assignment Wednesday at La Ballona Elementary
School in Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   "The words started to get all mixed up and I felt dizzy," she
said. "My head started to hurt."</LD>
<LD>   Shelby was the last in her family to catch a late-season flu bug.
Her 1-year-old sister was the first, and within days both parents and
all five children in the family were coughing and struggling with
upset stomachs.</LD>
<TE>   "We all had it so bad," said Shelby's mother, Tammy
Cottey-Gonzalez. "It was like the plague."</TE>
<TE>   A Type B flu outbreak has hit Los Angeles County unexpectedly,
health experts say, striking many elementary and middle school
students in the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the flu season --which traditionally closes at the end
of March--had been exceptionally mild, said Dr. David Dassey, deputy
director of acute communicable disease control for the county
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Reports started trickling in around March 15, and schools began
citing an increased number of student and teacher absences, Dassey
said. The highest number--25% of all reported flu cases since
October--came in just last week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "School nurses were calling us saying, 'There's a line outside my
office. They all have the same thing. What is it?'" Dassey said.</TE>
<TE>   Students complained of headaches, sore throats, high fevers, body
aches and fatigue. Dassey said it hard to explain why the flu has
crept up so late in the season, but that children may be more
susceptible because they are rarely vaccinated and swap germs in
school all day.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids may be less hygienic, coughing, sneezing and putting other
kids at risk," he said. "So ground rules still apply here: Cover your
mouth when you cough, wash your hands frequently, and, if you're
sick, stay away from other people."</TE>
<TE>   Dassey said cases have been reported in Eagle Rock, Hollywood,
Redondo Beach, South-Central Los Angeles, Sylmar, Van Nuys and West
Covina--and everywhere in between.</TE>
<TE>   But an official of the Orange County Health Care Agency said
experts are not aware of an increase in cases in their area.</TE>
<TE>   The problem appears to be generally concentrated in Southern
California so far, said Dr. Robert Murray, an epidemiologist with the
California Department of Health Services' Division of Communicable
Disease Control. It has been a mild flu season statewide, although
Northern California has seen a slight increase in cases over the last
few weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Rue, a communicable disease resource nurse for the Los
Angeles Unified School District, said this season's flu is different
because it lasts only three or four days, instead of the usual seven
days. But students are running severe temperatures, in some cases as
high as 104 degrees, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to be like the rolling virus," Rue said. "It starts in
the classroom, but then siblings pick it up and it rolls over to
another classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Ann Jones, a nurse for the Hermosa Beach City School District,
said she has been telling everybody to wash their hands and go to bed
early.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them, 'Don't share your food, don't drink out of the same
cup,'" she said. "But you know, kids will be kids."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said she sent 10 students home from school in the last three
days, and her own daughter contracted the flu a couple of weeks ago.
"I said, 'Oh my goodness, it really has hit,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   The flu may be life-threatening for the elderly, the very young or
people with cancer, HIV and AIDS, health officials said. They
recommend drinking lots of liquid, resting and taking acetaminophen
or ibuprofen for aches. Parents should not give their children any
medication with aspirin because it may increase their risk of
developing Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal liver disease,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide in recent years, influenza of one strain or another is
associated with an average of 20,000 deaths annually and more than
100,000 hospitalizations, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   In Culver City, Shelby said she likes to takes hot baths when she
is sick with the flu. On Wednesday, she had a relapse and had to rest
in the nurse's office until her aunt picked her up early from school.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby remembered how horrible it was last week when her entire
family was suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "It was bad. Everybody was in and out of the bathroom," she said.
"My mom couldn't get out of bed, and we had to keep on going to the
market to get Sprite and Gatorade and chicken soup."</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Larry Gonzalez, said he had hoped that Shelby might
have been the lucky one in the family to resist the flu. But with
classmates and family members carrying the virus, she ended up with
aches and dizziness too. "It's a school thing, man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother added jokingly, "Kids. They're little germ carriers."</TE>

seven-member Culver City household to resist the flu, but the
third-grader became ill Wednesday.</CP>

<HD>Chronic Diseases Affect Poor Areas More</HD>
<DH>Health: Report shows disparities in access to care and
incidence of illnesses in the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poorer areas in Los Angeles have a higher incidence of chronic
diseases such as diabetes and more risky behaviors such as drug and
alcohol use than more wealthy locales, a new county health report
found.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials found the extent of the geographic disparities in
health status and access to health care disturbing. South-Central and
downtown were hardest hit.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released Wednesday, was based on surveys by the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services as well as other state
and county organizations.</LD>
<TE>   "The disparities should outrage those who really care about the
health of our residents," said Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, director of
public health at the county Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a call for help, but more than that, it's a call for
stronger collaborative efforts and to make sure that we are doing
everything that can be done to improve the health of adults and
children."</TE>
<TE>   The south area, which includes South-Central, Lynwood and Compton,
has the highest rate of births to teens and the lowest access to
prenatal care, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   It leads the county in incidences of breast cancer, heart disease
death, cervical cancer and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   It also has the highest rate of obesity and the highest number of
uninsured adults and children.</TE>
<TE>   The metro area, which includes West Hollywood and downtown Los
Angeles, had twice the tuberculosis rates of the San Gabriel and San
Fernando valleys and nearly three times the state AIDS rate.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Wold, chief of the health assessment unit at the Los
Angeles County health department, said the agency felt the need to
release the information because it "wants the information in the
hands of the people who can act" to change the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to do everything we can to reduce disparities in health,"
she said. "We issue reports like these because we know we can't do
this alone."</TE>
<TE>   The report shows the importance of promoting healthy behavior in
the areas that are affected most, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Poor communities tend to have higher rates of substance abuse as
well as obesity, which Fielding called a "prescription for disaster"
because of its link to cancer and heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, only about one in 10 adults consumes the recommended
servings of fruits and vegetables a day. More than 40% reported
getting little or no exercise a day. This behavior is even more
prevalent in low-income areas.</TE>
<TE>   "We need aggressive outreach," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas,
whose district includes parts of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We need information in schools, libraries, religious
institutions, anywhere people would turn. There should be billboards.
We need a full-on assault against everything that diminishes and
deteriorates the quality of health."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is committed to boosting enrollment in health insurance
programs for the poor, such as Healthy Families and Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Belinda Towns, a county health officer in the south division, said
the report helped the department identify health problems and
compelled her to assemble community groups to target them.</TE>
<TE>   She said they will focus on decreasing risky sexual behavior,
increasing physical activities among children and seeking ways to
expand prenatal care and insurance coverage. The plans are still in
the beginning stages, she said, but if they get cooperation from
school and city officials and other organizations, "we should be able
to make a dent."</TE>
<TE>   Fielding agreed, adding that collaborative efforts have helped the
county reduce smoking and improve immunization.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we use [the information], and [that it] not
stay on the shelf," he said.</TE>

<HD>Search for County Schools Superintendent Narrowed to 5
Finalists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state overseer of the Compton school district, the Salt Lake City
schools chief and the top deputy to Los Angeles Unified School
District Supt. Roy Romer are among the leading candidates to become
the next superintendent of the county Office of Education, according
to people familiar with the search.</LD>
<LD>   The names of five finalists have been forwarded to the county
Board of Supervisors, which is expected to conduct interviews in the
next several weeks. The board chooses the superintendent even though
the county has its own Board of Education, also appointed by the
supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   The superintendent oversees a little-known but powerful education
bureaucracy. With a budget of $700 million, the Office of Education
offers support programs for school districts, and provides classroom
instruction for 8,000 special education students and an estimated
30,000 juvenile offenders.</LD>
<TE>   After seven years on the job, the previous superintendent, Donald
Ingwerson, resigned and went to work at a Boston-based nonprofit that
provides technical assistance to school districts.</TE>
<TE>   The acting superintendent, Marilyn Gogolin, is one of the
finalists. She has received support from members of the education
board.</TE>
<TE>   "Our board is with her," said member Angie Papadakis. "It would
take a year for someone to walk in from the outside and try to figure
out what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   If the supervisors prefer an outsider, they can choose from among
Randolph E. Ward, the Compton state trustee; Salt Lake City schools
Supt. Darline Robles, a former superintendent in Montebello; Los
Angeles Unified Deputy Supt. Maria Ott, a former superintendent in a
Santa Fe Springs district; and Las Virgenes Unified Supt. John
Fitzpatrick.</TE>

<HD>Most Teens Admit Risky Road Behavior</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new survey of Southern California teenagers found that more than
70% had been involved in drunk driving, drag racing or other reckless
behavior behind the wheel.</LD>
<LD>   The California Institute of Transportation study, released
Wednesday, found that more teenagers drive dangerously than most
academics and law enforcement officials had suspected, said Sheila
Sarkar, a San Diego State University researcher who co-authored the
report.</LD>
<LD>   "This is something to be worried about," said Sarkar, who called
the survey the first of its kind.</LD>
<TE>   Sarkar surveyed more than 400 teenagers, who were taking driving
lessons in San Diego, Orange and Los Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   The young people reported that their sometimes death-defying
behavior was often influenced by friends and parents with unsafe
driving habits.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40% of the teenagers said they had witnessed their
parents swearing at other drivers. More than 20% said their parents
make rude gestures and 30% have seen their parents honk or flash
lights at other motorists while driving.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to behavior behind the wheel, teenage boys and girls
said their fathers are their biggest influence, according to the
survey.</TE>
<TE>   However, the survey also found that children of stay-at-home
mothers were less likely to drive recklessly or ride with other
unsafe drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also suggested a connection between teenage behavior on
the road and their hobbies. Only about half who said their hobbies
were reading, writing or working on a computer were involved in
high-risk driving.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, 80% of teens who said they participated in contact
sports or enjoyed repairing and modifying cars said they have been
involved in dangerous driving.</TE>
<TE>   Teenage driving is a topic of growing concern, and for good
reason. Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for young
people between ages 15 and 20. In 2000, 3,594 drivers in that age
group were killed and 348,000 were injured in car crashes nationwide,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Sarkar's survey suggested that underage drinking is often involved
when teenagers are drag racing, speeding or driving unsafely.</TE>
<TE>   More than 77% of teenage males said they had been involved in
drunk driving and racing, and 74% of females said they were the
driver or passenger during an episode of drinking and unsafe driving.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Pasco, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said the survey findings were
disturbing but not surprising. She said other research has shown that
alcohol often is involved when teenagers decide to speed, race or
drive recklessly.</TE>
<TE>   Pasco and others note that teenagers are more vulnerable to auto
accidents because they have the least amount of driving experience
and a naive impression that they can survive anything that happens.</TE>
<TE>   "They think they are 10 feet tall and bulletproof," Pasco said.</TE>

<LD>Three children are in protective custody while detectives investigate
the death of their 1-year-old sister, police said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Officers responding to a 911 call Tuesday found the body of
Samantha Rose Gutierrez in her family's home on North Harbor
Boulevard, Police Sgt. Mike Hidalgo said.</LD>
<LD>   "The call was for a child not breathing," he said. A month-old
girl and two boys, 2 and 5 years old, were taken into protective
custody, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Police got a call in January from a child-abuse hotline operator
relaying an anonymous allegation of child abuse in the home, but
officers who responded saw no signs of abuse, Hidalgo said. The
parents have been questioned but are not under suspicion, he said.</TE>

<HD>Permit Problem Delays Granada Hills Landfill</HD>
<DH>Waste: City leaders say the postponement provides an
opportunity to study alternatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The operators of the controversial Sunshine Canyon Landfill withdrew
their application to expand into Granada Hills shortly after the city
of Los Angeles rejected the permit request as incomplete, officials
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Browning Ferris Industries said the delay is only temporary. But a
company spokesman said the opening of the dump in the city has now
been moved back from this spring to next year.</LD>
<LD>   Taking advantage of the latest delay, Mayor James K. Hahn and
Councilman Hal Bernson called for the city to reexamine options.</LD>
<TE>   "It does give us a window of opportunity to take another look at
this whole subject," Hahn said. "It's an opportunity to look at other
alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who called for closure of the dump when he ran for office
last year, said he supports a move by Bernson, City Council President
Alex Padilla and others to seek competitive proposals from waste
disposal operators.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good news," said Bernson, whose district includes the
landfill, about the delay. "We need to see if there are other means
of disposing of our trash."</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Berghoff, a spokesman for Browning Ferris, said previous
studies requested by Bernson found that alternatives such as sending
trash by rail to remote landfills would cost at least twice as much.
"Anything that is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars more
is not going to be viable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city already has approved building the facility with a
capacity of 11,000 tons of trash a day. The city of Los Angeles now
generates about 3,400 tons daily.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill, which straddles the city-Los Angeles County border
in the north San Fernando Valley, operated for decades in the city
before its permit expired in 1991. The county in 1996 gave Browning
Ferris permission to operate on its side of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Any delay in opening the dump would help Los Angeles, because the
dump will be a major campaign topic for advocates of San Fernando
Valley secession, said Kim Thompson of the North Valley Coalition, an
anti-landfill group.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the mayor's office they better pay attention to this
because it will be a secession issue," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a mayoral appointee to the city Environmental Affairs
Commission, released a copy of an e-mail from Sanitation Bureau chief
Judith Wilson to Wayne Tsuda, the city official considering the
Sunshine Canyon permit application.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we are interested in getting the city side opened, but I
wonder about the timing," it reads. "You will have a red hot Valley
issue erupting in the months prior to the November 2002 ballot
measure on secession. The timing is terrible. We should talk about
this with the mayor before moving forward on this schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation Bureau spokesman Mike Qualls said the e-mail "simply
illustrates the bureau's sensitivity over Valley issues." Tsuda
confirmed that he received the e-mail but said it did not influence
his decision to reject the permit as incomplete.</TE>

<LD>Ventura County elections officials today will conduct a recount of
ballots cast by Fillmore voters in the March 5 election to verify
that a tax proposal to support a new community pool did fail.</LD>
<LD>   Measure Q would have assessed $15 a year on property owners to pay
for maintaining a swimming pool to be built near Fillmore High
School. The city's old pool was shut down last year for health and
safety reasons.</LD>
<LD>   A majority of Fillmore voters favored Measure Q, but such tax
measures require a two-thirds majority. The vote, according to
certified results, fell just short with 65.7% support.</LD>
<TE>   Officials will inspect ballots that earlier were counted by
machines. The machines counted votes from 1,987 ballots and recorded
39 additional ballots as "undercounts," on which voters did not make
a choice for or against Measure Q.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all 39 undercounts had voted for Measure Q, elections
officials said, the measure likely would still fall short of the
1,351 favorable votes required.</TE>

<HD>Water Agencies Dig Deep for a Cheaper Supply in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Resources: Aquifers had gone untapped because of bad color,
but new filtering technologies give districts an alternative to
costly importation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA and STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to reduce Orange County's reliance on expensive imported
water, some water agencies are digging deeper into local aquifers to
reach a supply of drinking water known for its off-putting color.</LD>
<LD>   The water is safe to drink but has remained largely untapped
because of its peculiar color, which resembles iced tea or cola. The
agencies send the water through a process that removes the color and
makes it indistinguishable from tap water.</LD>
<LD>   The colored water lies beneath clear-water aquifers that have
supplied a good deal of Orange County's water for more than a
century. The clear-water aquifers contain 10 million to 40 million
acre-feet of water (an acre-foot is enough to serve two typical
families for a year). Officials believe there's an extra 1 million
acre-feet of colored water that can be tapped with new wells that
reach 2,000 feet underground.</LD>
<TE>   The water gets its color from the remnants of ancient redwood
forests.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very old and high-quality water," said Ron Wildermuth,
spokesman for the Orange County Water District. Officials said
tapping the colored water supply serves another important function:
Protecting the clear-water aquifers from contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, as more and more production occurred in our
[clear] aquifer, the pressures in that aquifer have decreased while
the pressures in the deep aquifer have remained the same," said
William Mills, general manager of the Orange County Water District.
"Now, we have more pressure in the deeper, colored zone and it tends
to move upward ... and get into the [clear-water] wells."</TE>
<TE>   The process of removing the color makes it more expensive than
other local water. But officials said it is still cheaper than
importing water from the Colorado River and Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The effort comes amid indications that imported water will be
harder to come by because of environmental concerns in Northern
California and the Colorado River area. The colored-water projects
are just one way agencies are trying to reduce reliance on imported
water. The biggest projects are a $600-million plant that would turn
sewage into drinking water and a plan to desalinate ocean water.</TE>
<TE>   "As our imported supplies continue to be challenged ... it is just
intelligent that we develop all of the local supplies we can,"
Wildermuth said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Ranch Water District formally dedicated its deep
aquifer treatment system Wednesday. It will treat 7,400 acre-feet of
water a year--enough to serve nearly 60,000 people. The water is
softer than the Colorado River water imported by the Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California because it contains fewer
minerals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Colorado River carved the Grand Canyon, so that gives you an
idea of the minerals it contains," said Marilyn Smith, a spokeswoman
for the Irvine Ranch Water District .</TE>
<TE>   As water filtration technology has improved, the cost of tapping
the colored water has gone down. Special membranes known as
nanofilters--essentially acting as a superfine sieve--strain the
color molecules from the water.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine district's system, built on property leased from Santa
Ana, cost $16 million. But savings of $8,600 a day in decreased
consumption of imported water means the facility will pay for itself
in five years, said Paul Jones, district general manager.</TE>
<TE>   The system, conceived in the early 1990s, was tested at a pilot
plant for two years, and then went into full production in February,
said Greg Heiertz, director of engineering and planning for the
district, which serves all of Irvine and parts of Tustin, Newport
Beach, Lake Forest and Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Mesa Consolidated Water District has been using ozone filtration
since 1984 to strip the color from 3,500 acre-feet of water a year at
a Costa Mesa well, said Diana Leach, the district's general manager.
Two additional wells with the ozone technology are being tested, and
once online full-time, will have the capacity to create an extra
12,800 acre-feet.</TE>

<HD>Dolphin Eludes Capture Efforts in Oxnard Canal</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Mammal swims into narrow waterway and becomes
trapped. Would-be rescuers plan to try again today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A disoriented dolphin that cornered itself at the end of an Oxnard
canal eluded repeated attempts to snare it Wednesday, and rescuers
vowed to go after it again today.</LD>
<LD>   The gray mammal, about 200 pounds and 4 feet long, swam nearly
five miles from the start of the narrow waterway at Mandalay Bay to a
large pool inside the Mandalay Generating Station, just off Harbor
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one for the books," said Joe Cordero, a wildlife
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of
the U.S. Department of Commerce. "We usually get harbor seals or
California sea lions or sea turtles, but this is our first dolphin
rescue up there."</LD>
<TE>   The dolphin was first spotted about 7 a.m. Wednesday by Harold
Brennan, a plant mechanic who was using a large wire basket to scoop
seaweed and debris from the canal. The plant, owned by Reliant
Energy, uses the canal water to cool scalding-hot generator pipes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was actually very playful," Brennan said as he sat inside the
cab of a towering crane that would be used in a rescue effort to
hoist the animal to safety. "Every time I'd scoop, he'd start
jumping."</TE>
<TE>   After the discovery, plant officials immediately contacted the
Organization for the Respect and Care of Animals, whose volunteers
specialize in such rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   For two hours Wednesday, a dozen local ORCA members--two in an
inflatable boat and several more along the rocky shoreline--tried
trapping the dolphin in a 50-foot fishing net.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers had rigged the net on one side with weights and used
buoys on the other side to create a floating curtain that the dolphin
could swim into. But the creature eluded the net.</TE>
<TE>   The operation was halted about 6 p.m. as darkness arrived and the
water level in the canal started to rise with the ocean's tide,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers plan to return today and continue the effort.</TE>
<TE>   If the dolphin is rescued, it will be loaded onto a flatbed truck
and taken to the Laguna Beach marine center, where biologists will
run several tests to determine whether the creature is healthy enough
for rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero will ultimately decide whether the mammal will be treated
or euthanized. Of concern is whether the dolphin has ingested a
naturally occurring sea toxin that has been blooming in algae off the
coast and killing dozens of marine mammals in Ventura and Los Angeles
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarian Samuel Dover, an ORCA volunteer, said the dolphin
appeared to be breathing normally.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes this happens because they take a wrong turn or they are
chasing fish or it's a disease," Dover said. "There are several
excuses and reasons."</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, however, animal rescuers have recovered more
than a dozen infected dolphins that beached themselves along the
Ventura County coastline. Most did not survive, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They strand themselves and often have seizures," said ORCA
volunteer Edward Burgus.</TE>
<TE>   Cordero was not optimistic, saying because the dolphin traveled so
far in the canal and had not tried to return, he believed it was no
longer healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are slim it will survive" if it has been infected,
Cordero said in an interview from his office in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a dozen Reliant officials spent most of Wednesday
watching the dolphin swim around and surface for air. Many wondered
how the creature had reached the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials and rescue volunteers believe there is an
underwater gate to stop such intrusions, but city and harbor
officials say they are not aware of any such gate.</TE>
<TE>   If one does not exist, company officials said they would consider
installing one.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers and officials both said sea mammals have been trapped
at least twice at the Mandalay facility and at the company's power
plant at Ormond Beach. Those instances, however, involved an elephant
seal and a sea turtle.</TE>
<TE>   "I deal with ORCA all the time but it's mostly been at other
sites," plant manager G.K. Malik said. "We've never had a dolphin
before."</TE>

electrical generating station in Oxnard on Wednesday. The 4-foot,
200-pound mammal swam nearly five miles up a narrow canal from
Mandalay Bay to reach the power plant's cooling-water pool. Animal
rescue experts were called in but were unable to snare the dolphin
and return it to the sea. They planned to try again this morning.</CP>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Redistricting Commission on Wednesday voted to
recommend to the City Council a map outlining new boundaries for 15
council districts.</LD>
<LD>   As the council begins its hearings on the proposed redistricting
plan today at City Hall, winners and losers in the commission process
were preparing for the next battle.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal increases from four to five those districts in which
Latino voters are a plurality. It also increases the number of
districts wholly in the San Fernando Valley from four to five.</LD>
<TE>   The recommendation also addressed concerns by Councilwoman Wendy
Greuel that her 2nd District, as originally proposed, would have
become a long, narrow, odd-shaped district that included the
disparate communities of Sunland-Tujunga in the East Valley and
Encino in the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After lobbying from Greuel, who won election March 5, the
commission Tuesday recommended a revised plan for a more compact 2nd
District that swaps Studio City for Encino and keeps the district
east of the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps communities of interest together," Greuel said.</TE>

<HD>Man Kills His Ex, Her Mother, Then Himself</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police find the bodies, then track him to his
Nebraska hometown, where he commits suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man who killed his ex-girlfriend in Santa Monica and stabbed her
mother to death in Westchester committed suicide Wednesday when
police cornered him in a small Nebraska town, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in his ex-girlfriend's car and facing a blockade of
Nebraska police and SWAT members, William Wheeler Jr., 41, shot
himself in the head, said LAPD Capt. Ken Hillman.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles police had put out a nationwide alert for Wheeler
after finding the bodies of Anna Catherine Hughes, 66, and her
37-year-old daughter in their homes Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a really sad story, but we realized the possibility that
this guy was out there on the loose, and thank God this guy is off
the streets," Hillman said.</TE>
<TE>   A concerned neighbor found Hughes' body in the kitchen, Hillman
said. Police said they found spent bullet shells in the home, but a
spokesman for the coroner's office said she died from multiple stab
wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors told police they had seen Wheeler leaving her home in
the 8000 block of Regis Way on Monday. Hughes' son told them that his
mother had urged his sister to break up with Wheeler, who had become
increasingly violent.</TE>
<TE>   After finding Hughes' body, officers tried to notify her daughter
in Santa Monica, calling pagers and a variety of phone numbers to no
avail, Hillman said. The LAPD then contacted Santa Monica police, who
used a battering ram to enter the daughter's home in the 2300 block
of Ocean Park Boulevard about 6:15 p.m., said Santa Monica Lt. Frank
Fabrega.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter, whose name has not been released, was wrapped and
bound inside a closet, Hillman said. Neighbors said they last saw her
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica detectives learned that Wheeler had family in
Kimball, Neb., a town of about 2,500, Fabrega said. They notified
Nebraska state troopers, and Kimball police began approaching the
home of Wheeler's father, a truck driver, about 12:30 p.m. Wheeler
drove from the home as officers approached and had gone about eight
blocks when he killed himself.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, neighbors in Santa Monica said, Wheeler
had been acting increasingly strange. One day last summer, after
years of conservative dress, he came home with a mohawk. He gained
weight. He hadn't been working, they said. He was verbally abusive to
his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Outside her apartment Wednesday evening, neighbors and friends
erected a memorial of candles. She "was warm, cheerful, friendly,
positive and hard-working," said Marinella Baldwin, 57, a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   In Westchester, neighbors of Hughes described her as a humorous,
vivacious Irishwoman who traveled to her homeland and often went to
Irish cultural events.</TE>
<TE>   "You would see her push her lawn mower around like she was 25,"
said Elizabeth Hoyt, 85.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a very good sense of humor," said another neighbor, who
declined to be named. "Anything could be laughed at to her."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said Hughes and her daughter had traveled together to
Ireland about a year ago. The daughter "came back and it was like she
had a new sense of herself," Baldwin said. "She was happy."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Airman Convicted of Rape in Japan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NAHA, Japan
</DL>
<LD>A court convicted a U.S. airman today of raping a Japanese woman
and sentenced him to 32 months in prison, concluding a case that deepened
resentment toward American troops stationed in Okinawa.</LD>
<LD>   Air Force Staff Sgt. Timothy B. Woodland went on trial in September
after being charged with raping the 20-year-old woman in a parking lot
outside a popular Okinawa nightclub June 29.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had demanded a three-year sentence for Woodland, who was
tried in Naha District Court. Naha is Okinawa's capital city.</LD>
<TE>   The airman pleaded innocent to the allegations, saying he had
consensual sex with the woman. His hometown and the name of the woman
have not been released. Rape convictions in Japan typically carry prison
sentences of two to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the defense team is concerned, we are shocked because we
were totally expecting a not guilty verdict," said attorney Annette M.
Eddie-Callagain. She said the defense is advising Woodland to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Woodland is to serve the sentence in a prison near Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   The case stoked smoldering resentment in a part of Japan where tens of
thousands of U.S. troops are based and where residents are highly
sensitive to military-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   It attracted intense media coverage and raised pressure on the
Japanese government to revise an agreement with Washington that lets U.S.
authorities hold military personnel suspected of crimes until they are
formally charged.</TE>

<HD>British Mogul on Death Row Gets Life Term</HD>
<DH>Court: Miami judge gives the double murderer a reprieve. Lawmakers
in Britain had taken up felon's cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>Krishna Maharaj made a fortune importing bananas and once owned two
dozen Rolls-Royces and the second-largest string of racehorses in
Britain. He was a fixture of England's horsy set, and one of his
thoroughbreds beat out Queen Elizabeth II's own entry at Ascot.</LD>
<LD>   These days, the 63-year-old British subject of West Indian heritage
wears prison blues and is inmate No. 109722 in Florida's prison system.
Convicted of a double murder, he has been fighting to hang on to what
remains of his life.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, a Miami jury gave him what he had been seeking: a
reprieve from death in the electric chair, and a life sentence in a cell
instead.</LD>
<TE>   Scores of members of Parliament and a considerable chunk of the
British establishment had taken up Maharaj's cause in the latest dispute
over the death penalty to set the United States against one of its
European allies--in this case, its closest ally.</TE>
<TE>   The last Briton was sent to the gallows 40 years ago, and hangings
were abolished in that country in '98.</TE>
<TE>   "The British government is anti-death penalty in all cases," said
British Deputy Consul General Stephen Collier, who attended court
proceedings for Maharaj in Miami. "We'll do everything we can in this and
any case to make sure the death penalty is not carried out."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, a Georgia pardons board rebuffed pleas from
British officials, including Prime Minister Tony Blair, and denied
clemency to a Briton who had been on the state's death row for 16 years.
On March 12, Tracy L. Housel, 43, who had been convicted of raping and
killing a woman he met at a truck stop north of Atlanta, was executed by
lethal injection.</TE>
<TE>   France, another major American ally in Europe that halted executions
in 1981, has alerted the United States that if Zacarias Moussaoui, one of
its nationals accused of being an accomplice of the Sept. 11 hijackers,
is charged with a crime that carries the death sentence, French
authorities will provide no evidence that might lead to a conviction on
that count.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is expected to announce, as early as today,
whether the U.S. government will seek the death penalty against
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   In the Maharaj case, a Florida court found him guilty in 1987 of
shooting to death a business partner and the man's son in a downtown
Miami hotel, and sentenced him to death in the son's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Maharaj spent a decade and a half on Florida's death row, until the
state's Supreme Court tossed out the death sentence because of procedural
irregularities, and paved the way for a resentencing hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The original trial was hardly a picture-perfect example of justice.
The judge was led away in handcuffs on charges of accepting bribes in
another case. With another judge brought in, the case against Maharaj
went forward uninterrupted.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that the physical evidence implicating Maharaj in the
murders is overwhelming, and that he gunned down Duane Moo Young, 23,
after reassuring the young man within earshot of a witness that he would
not harm him. Maharaj, in a separate federal appeal, has claimed he was
not even in Miami when the murders occurred.</TE>
<TE>   No fewer than 293 British parliamentarians petitioned Florida's
Supreme Court to have Maharaj freed, and the case was featured in a
BBC-TV documentary. On Monday, in the fourth-floor Miami courtroom where
the resentencing hearing was held, some prominent Britons testified on
Maharaj's behalf by satellite hookup.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Bottomley, a former Conservative Cabinet member, called Maharaj
"the kind of person I'm pleased to be associated with." Clive Brittain, a
horse trainer, said Maharaj gave him a generous leg up at the onset of
his career by sending him two fillies to train.</TE>
<TE>   Clive Stafford-Smith, a British-born attorney who crusades against the
death penalty in the United States, was present to participate in
Maharaj's defense. "I'm utterly convinced he's innocent," Stafford-Smith
said. For him, the issue is as much personal as legal--the attorney has
known Maharaj for decades, and Stafford-Smith's father sold the fruit
dealer two horses in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do we want to kill Kris Maharaj?" Stafford-Smith said. "There is
much good in him."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy State Atty. Sally Weintrab, in closing remarks to the jury,
painted a different portrait of the man who attended the hearing wearing
a black, white and gray pullover. She claimed Maharaj lured Derrick Moo
Young, 53, and his son into a trap with homicide on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a murder by appointment," Weintrab said. "He was shrewd,
canny and quick."</TE>
<TE>   At the original trial, Maharaj was sentenced to 25 years to life
imprisonment for the slaying of the elder Moo Young. According to news
reports, the partners had a falling out over a property deal gone bad in
which Maharaj believed he was bilked by Moo Young of more than $600,000.
His holdings had already been significantly trimmed by the British
property crash of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, a jury in a capital case can either recommend the death
penalty or life imprisonment. The 12 men and women impaneled to consider
Maharaj's fate deliberated over two days, then recommended a life term.
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jerald Bagley, who presided over the hearing,
accepted the jury's advice and promptly handed down a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the double-murder convictions and consecutive minimum
sentence requirements, Maharaj must serve 50 years in prison before being
eligible for parole, Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the Miami state
attorney's office, said.</TE>
<TE>   After the jury's decision was known, Griffith lashed out at the
British press, saying they had been so biased in their coverage of the
case that they unjustifiably defamed Maharaj's victims by labeling them
narcotic dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Stafford-Smith said the new sentence was a definite improvement, but
vowed to press on with motions to have the guilty verdicts against
Maharaj thrown out entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to get this far, but we still have a ways to go," the
defense attorney said. "We're going to federal court" today.</TE>
<TE>   Though Maharaj claims he was framed for what he says was a
drug-related hit, Bagley refused to allow anyone who testified to cast
doubt on the validity of the nobskeguilty verdicts themselves.
Stafford-Smith called it an outrage that a man fighting for his life was
not permitted to produce proof of his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Maharaj's younger brother, Ramesh, rose to be attorney
general of their native Trinidad and Tobago, where he was the Caribbean's
most vocal advocate of the death penalty.</TE>

it at Sacred Heart, a sturdy red-brick edifice three blocks off Main
Street.</LD>
<LD>   The cavernous sanctuary is filled with worshipers on weekends, the
parish fish fry was a smashing success, and so many youngsters have
signed up to be altar servers that some have to wait three months.</LD>
<LD>   Few in this heartland congregation, which makes up 40% of the town,
dwell on the widespread scandal about pedophile priests and
ecclesiastical cover-ups now convulsing the outside world. "People just
don't talk about it because they don't want to talk about it," said Kathy
Kuriger, 63, a former nun. "It's ugly."</LD>
<TE>   But when the subject comes up, most parishioners admit they're
disappointed or angry about revelations that some church authorities have
protected predator priests over the years. Like many Catholics in the
U.S., they are appalled that their spiritual leaders shuffled wayward
clerics from parish to parish, without a word to churchgoers or to law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a teacher, you'd be down to the police station," said
Janice Kraus, 72, mother of 16 and a Sacred Heart parishioner for 54
years. "Are [priests] any better than anyone else?"</TE>
<TE>   The scandal continues to grow almost daily. Last week, Pope John Paul
II used his pre-Easter message to priests to denounce the "grave
scandal"--his first public response this year to the crop of sexual abuse
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   To the faithful here, the priests' sins are further proof that no soul
is exempt from the temptations abounding in society today.</TE>
<TE>   "The easy access to the Internet and the poor morals on TV--I feel
that's starting to wear people down," said Linda Becker, 55, director of
religious education at the Sacred Heart School. "I'm an easy one to
forgive . . . but I feel the modern world has gotten to the priests."</TE>
<TE>   Halfway between Dubuque and Cedar Rapids, this rural community of
3,600 people and three stoplights is a far cry from Sunset Boulevard
decadence.</TE>
<TE>   Cars parked outside brick buildings on Main Street are left unlocked,
keys in the ignition. Citizens form exercise groups in warm weather to
walk through tree-lined streets of ranch homes. Coffee shop talk centers
on the latest farm distress sale and whether the new highway bypass will
hurt business.</TE>
<TE>   There is no movie theater, but there are 12 Christian
congregations--testament to how churches act as the town's social glue.
"Everyone here, in one form or another, has a spiritual link," said Nancy
Keedy, 46, executive director of the Monticello Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Catholics have seen their share of priestly lapses over the years in
northeastern Iowa, where Irish, German and Bohemian Catholics settled
during the 1800s to worship, and to farm the rolling hills.</TE>
<TE>   There was Father Ralph, the stern principal of Cascade High School,
one town over, who ran away with a nun during the 1960s. Father Timothy
of Dubuque landed in jail six years ago for molesting several altar boys;
he's now in a halfway house in Maryland. Father Michael of Marion was
removed two years ago after he made inappropriate overtures to someone
posing as a 13-year-old boy in an Internet chat room; the priest died in
a car crash last year.</TE>
<TE>   Worries over sex have even infiltrated the nearby New Melleray Abbey,
where 18 Trappist monks live their vows of poverty and chastity in
bucolic seclusion. The monastery has adopted a sexual harassment policy
regarding its 21 lay employees. The monks, whose average age is 70, were
briefed on the rules last week.</TE>
<TE>   "No sexual innuendoes, no dirty jokes, no touching," said Abbott
Brendan Freeman. "Like our lawyer said, this is life in modern America."</TE>
<TE>   But life at Sacred Heart reflects little of the current turmoil.</TE>
<TE>   With a membership of 1,500, it is the dominant faith in town. The
parish sold 1,200 dinners at its annual fish-fry earlier this month. Its
elementary and preschool classes enroll 170 youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not affecting anyone directly here," Keedy said of the sex
scandals. She has two children at Sacred Heart's school.</TE>
<TE>   "The [parishioners] are aware that it's going on, and it makes them
want to protect our kids more. . . . But that's not something you're
going to hear when you go out and have coffee in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   Some here suggest that it's time to let priests marry. Despite the
crisis, however, many expressed confidence that the church would rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not comfortable. You certainly wish it didn't happen,"
69-year-old Mel Manternach, a semiretired farmer, said over the
old-timers' weekly coffee and doughnuts in the church basement. "But the
church will survive and will be better off afterward."</TE>
<TE>   The scandal hasn't prompted any parents to yank children from altar
duty, parish workers said.</TE>
<TE>   Four of Jinggy Cigrand's kids are on the current roster of 79, and she
hasn't thought twice about letting them serve. Calling reports of errant
clerics "isolated incidents," the 43-year-old Cigrand added: "I don't
think it's affecting our faith or our trust in our parish priest."</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Neil W. Tobin said he doesn't worry whether parishioners bolt or
stop contributing toward the parish's $500,000 annual budget.</TE>
<TE>   An old-fashioned cleric trained in Rome, Tobin said he has zero
tolerance for those who use their pastoral position to seduce minors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Midwesterners," said Tobin, 69, who is set to retire in July.
"We're realists. We realize that some people have been injured by sin. We
certainly know the mercy of God. But such people can't prey on others.
They have to be held accountable. They have to be charged like anyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   Tobin criticized church authorities for coddling offenders. "They were
too kind, generous and as a result, it has blown up."</TE>
<TE>   He blamed Vatican II and 1960s liberalism for prompting church leaders
to use therapy, not conservative theology, to address errant priests. He
also said the dwindling number of seminary students has prompted church
authorities to look the other way, even if they know a recruit is gay.</TE>
<TE>   The Dubuque archdiocese, which includes Sacred Heart, faces a severe
shortage of priests. Currently there are 134 clergy ministering to
215,000 members in 212 parishes--requiring some priests to pull double
duty. Retirements are expected to deplete the ranks of clerics to fewer
than 100 within four years, said Vicar General James Barta,
second-in-charge of the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Barta said the archdiocese will revisit its policy on sexual abuse by
priests in May with its pastoral council, a group of lay and ordained
representatives. While written guidelines call for swift removal of an
offender, they don't require church officials to call police--something
that might change.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer something that can be dealt with for a very long time
at the internal level," Barta said. "It used to be we might work with the
person and see what should be done. But we probably wouldn't let much
time go by now. People, including priests . . . want to know if there are
any cases, that they've been acted on."</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Doug Herman, who attends Sacred Heart and sits on its
school board, said the scandals haven't hurt his confidence in the parish
but have "certainly shaken my faith in church leadership."</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the Catholic Church as a business," said the
35-year-old Herman, "you need parishioners. . . . You could make
non-Catholics look elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Penny Sue Rees, the daughter of a Baptist minister, has been taking
classes to prepare for her conversion at Sacred Heart. Rees, 41, said one
of the reasons she left her old faith was the hypocrisy she saw among
family members and others who were on good behavior at church but drank,
swore and were abusive at home.</TE>
<TE>   Now with disclosures that some priests betrayed their calling, she's
having second thoughts. She said she will keep her appointment to be
confirmed on Easter, but doesn't know whether she'll continue to attend
the church.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I won't," she said. "It's going to depend a lot on how the
Catholic Church deals with this."</TE>

<LD>Four Tanzanian teenagers held in an immigration detention center in
Harrisburg for eight months after leaving a Boy Scout gathering will be
allowed to move in with a foster family, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said the host family lives in the Midwest and speaks the boys'
language, Swahili.</LD>
<LD>   The boys, ages 17 and 16, left an international Boy Scout gathering
held near Fredericksburg, Va., in July, saying they wanted to find out
how they could stay in the U.S. and get an education. When they saw TV
reports of their disappearance, they turned themselves in.</LD>

<LD>Officials said the federal government will pay for gas mask-like
safety gear for thousands of people who live near an incinerator where
the Army will burn deadly nerve agents.</LD>
<LD>   As many as 35,000 people in eastern parts of the state could receive
the protective hoods and training. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency said no money would be released until the state provided a plan
for purchasing and maintaining the hoods, and for training people to use
them. The agency said many details had to be worked out.</LD>
<LD>   The deal laid the groundwork for what could be the first mass
distribution of such safety gear to civilians on U.S. soil.</LD>

<LD>Workers began dismantling a rusty guard tower at the Oak Ridge
nuclear weapon plant, a symbolic first step in modernizing the
59-year-old facility involved in building weapons ranging from the
Hiroshima bomb to the MX missile.</LD>
<LD>   The $4-billion modernization of the Y-12 plant includes rebuilding
facilities that date to 1943 and constructing a giant warehouse to store
stockpiles of weapon-grade uranium. Most of the uranium is stored in at
least five locations around the complex owned by the Energy Department.</LD>
<LD>   The warehouse will be as big as four football fields, and will hold as
many as 32,000 cans and drums of bomb-grade material.</LD>

<LD>A plan to reduce light pollution that threatens Arizona's

impact on the state," its sponsor, Rep. Jeff Hatch-Miller (R-Paradise
Valley), said.</LD>
<LD>   With amendments that were added before the vote, the bill would have
required the state and cities of 50,000 people or more to shield outdoor

<HD>Boston, in Deal With Gun Makers, Drops Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Citing financial concerns and improved weapon safety measures,
Boston on Wednesday dropped its lawsuit against the gun industry.</LD>
<LD>   The city had sued gun manufacturers, distributors and trade groups in
June 1999, alleging they were responsible for gun violence. The suit
sought to recover the costs of gun-related violence.</LD>
<LD>   There are 16 similar suits pending involving 25 other cities. Boston's
case was expected to be the first to go to trial, in September.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the suit was withdrawn after both sides
agreed to a resolution that calls for the industry to devote more
resources to combating gun violence in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   He also said going to trial was too expensive for the city.</TE>
<TE>   According to Boston's top health official, John Auerbach, the city was
spending $30,000 per month during the discovery phase of the case. He
could not give the total amount spent.</TE>
<TE>   "Under extreme pressure from our suit and others like it, the industry
is starting to take small steps to address our concerns of safety and
education," Menino said. "We're not there yet, but it's a move in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor cited new state regulations that mandate all firearms meet
minimum design and safety standards, and the gun industry's decision to
include free trigger locking devices with each firearm.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Henigan, legal director of the Washington-based Brady Center to
Prevent Gun Violence, which helps litigate the suits, said no other city
has voluntarily dropped a suit.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very sad day, but I think Boston is encouraging other cities
to carry on, and we think they will," he said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 21 similar suits in recent years, Henigan said. Courts
have dismissed cases brought by New Orleans; Miami; Bridgeport, Conn.;
and Camden County, N.J.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Finance Reform Bill, Turns to Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Politics: No usual fanfare accompanies the signing. Immediately,
two suits are filed. The president moves to help GOP net $4 million in
two days.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>In a subdued ending to a long and raucous debate, President Bush
quietly signed legislation Wednesday overhauling campaign fund-raising
rules, then set out to help Republicans collect about $4 million over two
days.</LD>
<LD>   Two lawsuits were immediately filed in federal District Court in
Washington challenging the new law's constitutionality.</LD>
<LD>   In a written statement announcing that he had signed the bill, Bush
said parts of it "present serious constitutional concerns." But he said
he believed the law, "although far from perfect, will improve the current
financing system for federal campaigns."</LD>
<TE>   His fund-raising trip reflected the power of his office in that
system. And that will endure: Much of the money he raised Wednesday would
be unaffected by the new law, which prohibits unlimited contributions to
the national political parties.</TE>
<TE>   Bush signed the bill in the Oval Office with none of the fanfare and
publicity that typically attend enactment of major legislation; looking
on were only Vice President Dick Cheney and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice, the White House said. That underscored Bush's
ambivalence about a measure that was the signature issue of his chief GOP
challenger in the 2000 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Final congressional passage of the bill last week culminated an effort
that began in 1995 and suffered several setbacks along the way. Yet
neither McCain nor any of the other main sponsors of the bill--Sen.
Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) and Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and
Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.)--were invited to the signing.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's supporters said they were not surprised that it became law
with so little fanfare, but some were irked by the offhand way they were
notified. McCain, for instance, was called at home Wednesday by a
mid-level White House aide.</TE>
<TE>   He issued a terse, one-sentence response to the enactment of what is
arguably the most significant legislative achievement of his career. It
read: "I'm pleased that President Bush has signed campaign finance reform
legislation into law."</TE>
<TE>   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) termed it
"unfortunate that the Bush administration decided not to invite these
reformers to the White House" for the signing. "These members deserved
greater recognition for their work," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The future of the law now rests in court. The first lawsuit filed, by
the National Rifle Assn., focuses on challenging restrictions placed on
advertising by interest groups, such as the NRA, unions or the Sierra
Club. Under the law, such groups cannot run certain political ads 30 days
before a primary vote or 60 days before a general election.</TE>
<TE>   The bill "eviscerates the core protections of the 1st Amendment by
prohibiting, on pain of criminal punishment, political speech," the NRA
said in its suit.</TE>
<TE>   Another, broader lawsuit challenging most of the law's major elements
as an unconstitutional restriction on free speech was filed as promised
by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a longtime foe of the reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I filed suit to defend the 1st Amendment right of all
Americans to be able to fully participate in the political process,"
McConnell said.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell's lawsuit takes aim at what all sides in the debate agree is
the measure's key provision--the ban on the unlimited donations known as
"soft money" to the national parties. During the 2000 campaign, the
combined amount of soft money raised by the two national parties totaled
about $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which does not take effect until after the November
elections, permits soft money donations of up to $10,000 a year to state
parties. Much of the money raised by Bush on his current trip would be
allowed under this provision.</TE>
<TE>   Bush left the White House moments after signing the campaign finance
measure to attend a fund-raiser in Greenville, S.C., on behalf of Rep.
Lindsey O. Graham. He then traveled to Atlanta for a similar event
benefiting Rep. Saxby Chambliss. The two Republicans are giving up their
House seats to run for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bush will headline a fund-raiser in Dallas for another GOP
Senate candidate, Texas Atty. Gen. John Cornyn.</TE>
<TE>   Counting the sums generated at these stops, Bush will have helped
raise at least $60 million since he took office.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in Greenville about his fund-raising efforts after signing a
bill that seeks to stem the influence of big money in politics, Bush
said, "I'm not going to lay down my arms. I'm going to participate in the
rules of the system."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the absence of ceremony reflected displeasure with the
measure, he said, "I wouldn't have signed it if I was really unhappy with
it."</TE>
<TE>   In his written statement, Bush praised the prohibition on soft money
contributions by unions and corporations, saying that was "a legislative
step for which I repeatedly have called."</TE>
<TE>   He expressed regret, though, that the prohibition also applies to
contributions by individuals. "I believe individual freedom to
participate in elections should be expanded, not diminished; and when
individual freedoms are restricted, questions arise under the 1st
Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   He also objected that the bill did not include a step that Republicans
had long sought: providing union members control over how their dues to
labor groups are spent in aiding political action committees. The support
from Democrats that was crucial to the bill's passage in Congress would
have vanished if that had been part of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   He applauded the increase the law allows in the amount of money that
individuals can contribute directly to candidates. The limit on these
so-called hard money donations will rise to $2,000 for every election
from the $1,000 cap set almost 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he had doubts about the legality of the restrictions on
political advertising by special interests.</TE>
<TE>   Bush divided his time Wednesday between the fund-raisers and
appearances that are considered part of the official business of the
presidency. In Greenville and Atlanta, he met with law enforcement
officials and emergency personnel who respond to catastrophes such as the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   That way, the cost of his travel is split between the government and
the politicians benefiting from his fund-raising. Bush's recent
predecessors had similar itineraries during election years.</TE>

<HD>No Conflict of Interest, Justices Rule on Lawyer in Capital Case</HD>
<DH>Law: Inmate's attorney represented the victim when he was killed.
But defendant must show counsel was 'adversely affected,' court says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court cleared the way Wednesday for Virginia to execute
a murderer whose court-appointed lawyer represented the victim at the
time he was slain.</LD>
<LD>   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the rather bizarre conflict of interest
did not require a new trial.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Antonin Scalia set a high standard for defendants who claim
their lawyers failed them because of a conflict of interest.</LD>
<TE>   A defendant must show the conflict "adversely affected his counsel's
performance," Scalia said. The court's duty is "not to enforce the Canons
of Legal Ethics," but to reverse an "unreliable verdict."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, inmate Walter Mickens Jr. could not show that his lawyer
had turned in a subpar performance during his trial nine years ago. He
and his new appellate lawyers could only suggest that the trial counsel
might have pursued other leads or made different arguments to spare
Mickens.</TE>
<TE>   The four dissenters said the trial obviously was flawed and should
have been set aside. They expressed amazement that a Virginia judge
assigned the same local lawyer to represent Mickens just weeks after
assigning him to defend the victim, Timothy Hall of Newport News, who had
been charged with an assault against his mother.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer, Bryan Saunders, met with Hall for less than 30 minutes to
discuss the case. A few days later, Hall, 17, was found dead. He had been
stabbed repeatedly and sodomized.</TE>
<TE>   Mickens was charged with the crime. He had an extensive criminal
record, including two convictions for sodomy. He also implicated himself
in a conversation with a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "To foist a murder victim's lawyer onto his accused is not only
capricious. It poisons the integrity of our adversary system of justice,"
Justice John Paul Stevens said in one of three dissenting opinions.</TE>
<TE>   A local newspaper had reported that Hall's body was found in an area
frequented by homosexuals. A lawyer for Mickens might have focused on
this point during the trial, possibly to suggest the meeting between
Mickens and Hall was initially consensual, according to a brief filed by
Mickens' appellate lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   But this might "cast Hall in a bad light," something Saunders might
have been reluctant to do, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Mickens vs. Virginia, 00-9285, drew as much attention from
legal ethicists as from those who track the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   In a friend-of-the-court brief, several experts in legal ethics argued
that clients have a right to a lawyer with "undivided loyalties." It
should not be necessary to prove after the fact that a conflicted lawyer
failed to perform his task effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the argument in this case also focused on how to assess the
judge's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Aundria D. Foster not only assigned Saunders to the case, but
apparently did not disclose the conflict of interest to Mickens or to any
of the parties at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome shows again that the high court majority is reluctant to
second-guess verdicts years later.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia's opinion upholding the death sentence was joined by his usual
allies: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Stevens, Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer dissented.</TE>

<HD>High Court Ruling Hurts Union Goals of Immigrants</HD>
<DH>Labor: An employer can fire an illegal worker trying to organize,
the justices decide. Exploitation is feared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Illegal immigrants who are wrongly fired for union organizing are
not entitled to back pay, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, a decision
that advocates say leaves millions of low-wage workers vulnerable to
being exploited by employers.</LD>
<LD>   On a 5-4 vote in a case involving a California company, the court
concluded that a worker's violation of the nation's immigration laws
outweighs an employer's violation of its labor laws.</LD>
<LD>   Undocumented immigrants have no legal right to work in the United
States, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said. It would "trivialize the
immigration laws [and] also condone and encourage future violations" if
these same unlawful employees could win money awards for lost work, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   The four liberal dissenters saw the matter through a different prism.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling will undermine labor laws and encourage employers to hire
illegal immigrants if they can escape the penalties for doing so, Justice
Stephen G. Breyer said.</TE>
<TE>   "With a wink and a nod," Breyer said, employers can hire these
low-wage workers and fire them with impunity if they try to form a union.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in the case of a Los Angeles-area chemical plant that
had hired a worker who presented a false Texas birth certificate in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a year later, the worker, Jose Castro, was fired along with
three others for passing out union cards at the plant in Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1930s, the National Labor Relations Act has prohibited
employers from punishing workers for trying to organize a union.
Violators can be forced to rehire the workers or pay them for their lost
work.</TE>
<TE>   In the Paramount case, an administrative law judge found that the
plant, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, had illegally fired Castro. But during
a 1993 hearing on the issue of back pay, the company's lawyer learned
that Castro was born in Mexico, not Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no idea until then that this guy was an illegal alien," said
Ryan McCortney, the Costa Mesa attorney for the company.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, the judge said Castro was entitled to nothing. The
National Labor Relations Board in Washington disagreed. The independent
federal agency ruled that, although the illegal worker was not entitled
to be rehired, he was owed $67,000 for more than three years of lost
work--the time between his firing and the discovery of his illegal
status.</TE>
<TE>   The full U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington upheld this decision. But
over the objections of Bush administration lawyers, the Supreme Court
took up the company's appeal and voided the award Wednesday (Hoffman
Plastic Compounds vs. NRLB, 01-1595).</TE>
<TE>   McCortney, the company's lawyer, said he believes the ruling "will
have broader implications" in future cases where illegal immigrants seek
monetary damages from employers.</TE>
<TE>   It would not, for example, change an employer's duty to pay minimum
wages, he said. However, "it could affect the remedies [for legal
violations]. This was about unearned wages for work not performed,"
McCortney said.</TE>
<TE>Losers Are Those 'Most In Need' of Protection</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders and immigrant rights activists said Wednesday's ruling
undercuts the rights of the most vulnerable workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers find it cheaper to hire workers who are undocumented and
fire them if they try to organize," said Rebecca Smith, an attorney for
the National Employment Law Project in Olympia, Wash. "This ruling leaves
these workers helpless to seek a legal remedy. They are the very people
who are most in need of the protections of our labor laws."</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders have been frustrated in their efforts to organize unions
in industries that have large numbers of undocumented workers.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision will allow employers to victimize undocumented workers
and escape the consequences for doing so," said Jonathan Hiatt, a lawyer
for the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 11 million
undocumented workers live in the United States, about half of them in
California.</TE>
<TE>   State lawyers for California, New York, Arizona, Hawaii, Massachusetts
and West Virginia had urged the court to uphold the back pay verdict
against the employer. It will "severely jeopardize the ability of states
to enforce" their worker rights laws if employers are shielded in cases
of undocumented workers, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist's opinion for the majority was joined by Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Breyer in dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</TE>
<TE>'It Just Escalates the Exploitation'</TE>
<TE>   Labor organizers said the ruling will make it more difficult to
convince undocumented workers to file complaints for unpaid wages and
safety violations, as well as to support a union campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is, they are not entitled to any rights," said Arturo
Rodriguez, president of the United Farm Workers. "We're going to find
very soon that employers are going to create a second class of workers.
It just escalates the exploitation."</TE>
<TE>   Miles Locker, an attorney with the California Labor Commissioner's
office, said that the ruling would not limit the state's ability to
collect wages for work that was performed, if, for example, an employer
routinely paid less than the minimum wage. However, the state would no
longer be able to protect workers who are fired after complaining about
such wage violations or other abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem because it leaves undocumented workers vulnerable to
discharge for doing those things that they have every right to do," he
said. "It tends to encourage the most unscrupulous employers to only hire
undocumented workers and then fire them when they try to assert their
rights."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and others, however, said the decision could also galvanize
support for a new legalization program for illegal immigrants, which the
AFL-CIO has advocated for two years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slap in the face by a Supreme Court that made an ideological
decision," said Eliseo Medina, a vice president of the Service Employees
International Union and a leading proponent for a new amnesty program.
"I've been getting calls all day from people saying we really need to
step up our campaign. Everyone's reaction is one of anger. We are, and
should be, outraged."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, activists working to improve pay and conditions for
garment and restaurant workers and day laborers said they hope state
agencies will interpret the decision narrowly, pertaining only in the
case of union-organizing campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to look at this as optimistically as possible and move
these cases forward," said Victor Narro of the Coalition for Humane
Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. "If somebody does decide to go to court
on this [issues not involving union campaigns] it could get kicked back
to the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Unions and activists have long complained of employers using
immigration laws to intimidate and fire assertive workers. Although
undocumented workers are rarely reinstated, state and federal agencies
have often awarded back pay when the firing was deemed illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Savage reported from Washington and Cleeland from Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets One-Two Punch on Energy</HD>
<DH>Policy: A leading senator seeks disclosures from White House on
Enron contacts. Green groups are back in court on document release issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's contacts with energy industry lobbyists
and campaign contributors, including Enron Corp., came under increased
scrutiny on two fronts Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, asked the White House to disclose its contacts with
Enron as part of a congressional probe into the energy giant's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   And environmentalists asked a federal judge to order a hearing on what
they call "stonewalling" by the Energy Department in the release of
documents related to the administration's meetings with industry groups
during drafting of a national energy policy.</LD>
<TE>   "Too many watchdogs failed to bark" during the Enron debacle,
Lieberman said. "I will not hesitate to ask for anything that helps us to
investigate . . . what the federal government might have done to prevent,
or at least anticipate, Enron's demise."</TE>
<TE>   The White House is reviewing Lieberman's letter to White House Chief
of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., said spokeswoman Anne Womack. But, she
added, "I think the American people are pretty sick and tired of these
kinds of open-ended fishing expeditions."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman also asked the U.S. archivist for information on contacts
between federal agencies and Enron dating back to 1992, a period that
would cover the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has acknowledged that Enron officials met six
times with members of the energy task force, including once with Vice
President Dick Cheney, who headed it.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed Wednesday seeking a contempt-of-court ruling,
the Natural Resources Defense Council accused the Energy Department of
delaying the release of the documents in order to engage in "spin"
control. The council had sued for access to the papers, which it first
sought almost a year ago under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Energy Department spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto said the
department met the midnight deadline, adding: "I suspect NRDC may be
upset because their photo op was disrupted, but that's not contempt of
court."</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group that also sued for
access to energy documents, plans to ask a court to force the
administration to justify why so much information was deleted from the
documents and why 15,000 pages were withheld. The Freedom of Information
Act allows the government to withhold information that relates to the
government's "deliberative process."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman's letter and the new court filing were the latest rounds in
the legal and political fight over the role played by special interests
in shaping the task force's work.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the administration's policy have seized on documents
showing that Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, a key task force member,
held numerous meetings with industry representatives but none with
environmental groups while the plan, released in May, was being drafted.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists contend that the administration's plan, now before
the Democratic-controlled Senate, is tilted toward energy production,
while they favor more emphasis on conservation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration did develop an energy policy that was clearly
written by the utility industry and oil and gas companies," said Debbie
Sease, the Sierra Club's national legislative director. "The House passed
a bill that was just as bad or worse. The Senate started out with a good
bill . . . but it's being picked apart, vote by vote, to the point that
unless it gets fixed, it's not going to be acceptable energy policy
either."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Natural Resources Defense Council asserted that the
documents released this week show "the oil companies seem to be putting
words in our president's mouth," as the environmental group's lawyer,
Sharon Buccino, put it.</TE>
<TE>   The council produced a "suggested" presidential executive order
written by the American Petroleum Institute on March 20, 2001. API's
language--seeking to require federal agencies to assess the effects of
proposed regulations on energy supplies--turned up in an executive order
issued by President Bush two months later, the environmental group said.</TE>
<TE>   Complaining about the industry's influence, the council also cited a
March 2001 e-mail from a lobbyist for the Southern Co., an electric
utility, seeking a review of the new source review provision of the Clean
Air Act. This requires plants to install state-of-the-art pollution
control devices when they renovate their plants in a way that increases
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's energy plan later called for a review of the
rule.</TE>
<TE>   The administration contends that its energy plan is balanced,
including some measures sought by environmentalists and omitting many
sought by industry. An Energy Department spokesman said, for example,
that API made 25 recommendations, but only four were included in the
energy plan.</TE>

<HD>Pilots Ask U.S. to Look at Airbus Groundings</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Group from American Airlines says government should
assure airworthiness of planes after N.Y. crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>American Airlines pilots have told the government it should
consider grounding the Airbus A300-600, one of which crashed in New York
last year, because of safety questions.</LD>
<LD>   American Airlines and Airbus Industrie say the plane is safe. The
Federal Aviation Administration has ordered new inspections of Airbus
A300-600s but has not ordered the grounding of the aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   In a report submitted this week to the FAA and the National
Transportation Safety Board, American's pilots concluded: "Serious
consideration must be given to grounding the entire A300-600 fleet until
its airworthiness can be assured."</LD>
<TE>   Eight pilots signed a letter accompanying the report, a copy of which
was obtained by Associated Press. The pilots presented the report
Wednesday to their union, the Allied Pilots Assn., which has not endorsed
the recommendations. Union representatives are helping the safety board's
investigation of the Nov. 12 crash, which killed 265 people.</TE>
<TE>   Some American pilots in January signed an e-mail petition asking the
company to ground the Airbus, but the effort failed. This is the first
time pilots have taken their request to the federal government. In their
letter, they attached the results of a two-month study analyzing safety
issues surrounding the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "The flying public must have assurances that every aircraft they board
is designed and maintained to the highest standards," the pilots said.</TE>
<TE>   Safety board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the agency had received
the report and would respond to it. FAA spokesman Les Dorr also said the
report would be reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   American Flight 587 experienced several sharp side-to-side movements
before its tail fell off and the plane crashed shortly after taking off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The FAA earlier this month
ordered inspections of A300-600 and A310 planes that experience similar
movements. Both planes have tails made of nonmetallic composite
materials.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, tails of A300-600s that have hit turbulence in the past
or had sharp rudder movements underwent ultrasound inspections. American
checked two planes and found no damage.</TE>
<TE>   The inspections came after safety board investigators found previously
undetected damage to the tail of an American Airbus that swayed while
trying to land at West Palm Beach Airport in Florida, in May 1997. Two
people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Airbus that crashed in November had been severely shaken by air
turbulence in November 1994 while flying from Barbados to Puerto Rico,
injuring 47 people, federal investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the plane's tail hit the runway while landing at Montego
Bay, Jamaica, in December 1997, safety board records show. No one was
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Dorr said future ultrasound inspections would depend on new evidence,
because taking off the tail could cause damage to the plane.</TE>
<TE>   In their report, the pilots called for reviewing the process for
certifying composite parts and for redesigning the rudders. They said
there have been several instances when the Airbus rudders moved on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, American Airlines noted that only eight of its 400
Airbus pilots signed the latest letter, and said no one has refused to
fly the plane. "If they don't think the Airbus is airworthy, why are they
still flying it?" the airline statement asked.</TE>
<TE>   Airbus officials have said tests show that damage that can't be seen
cannot weaken the tail, and company spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said
the safety board's investigation has not found any safety problems with
the plane. "The A300 was and remains a safe aircraft," she said.</TE>
<TE>   During the probe, board investigators discovered that moving a plane's
rudder in one direction, followed by a sharp movement in the other
direction, could break off the tail fin. The safety board issued such a
warning last month.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Army Secretary Thomas E. White said Wednesday he would resign if
the investigation into the bankruptcy of his former employer, Enron
Corp., distracts him too much from his military duties.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I could do something good for soldiers and their families,"
White said in an interview. "That is my focus. If I ever get to a point
where that's no longer possible, it doesn't make any sense to stay when
somebody else could do a better job."</LD>
<LD>   White said he would resign if the Enron investigation took too much of
his time, or if he felt his role in the matter had caused troops to lose
confidence in his leadership.</LD>

<HD>Pentagon Credit Card Abuse Will Be Targeted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A Pentagon task force created in response to reports of government
credit card abuse by defense workers and military personnel has been
given 60 days to develop a reform plan, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The task force will recommend legislative and administrative changes
to tighten controls over the Pentagon's 1.6 million credit cards and to
increase accountability for cardholders and the supervisors who approve
their charges.</LD>
<LD>   Changes under consideration include making credit card abuse a
specific violation under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, suspending
security clearances for abusers, mandatory salary deductions to repay
unauthorized charges, and increased prosecutions.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not going to let the grass grow under our feet on this one,"
said Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon's comptroller and chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked Zakheim last week to
investigate reports from congressional auditors that the military
services have done little to correct credit card abuses first uncovered
last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators found that more than 46,000 Defense
Department employees had defaulted on $62 million in official travel
expenses charged against government cards as of November. The bad debts,
most of which have been written off by banks that issue the cards, have
been increasing at the rate of $1 million a month.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Defense Department's 1.4 million travel cards are billed
directly to employees, who are supposed to use them only for official
government travel and pay the bills when they are reimbursed by the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Defense workers charged $3.4 billion on those travel cards last year.
Zakheim said 11.7% of the current amount owed on travel cards billed
directly to employees is more than 60 days overdue.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department also has about 207,000 purchase cards, which
were used last year to buy $6.1 billion in goods and services. Those
cards are billed directly to the government, and Zakheim said the
delinquency rate is 7.5%.</TE>
<TE>   While lawmakers have criticized the Pentagon for not taking credit
card abuse seriously, Zakheim said the agency has deactivated or canceled
more than 200,000 Pentagon credit cards in the last year and currently is
pursuing 17 criminal investigations involving 90 people.</TE>
<TE>   In one recently completed investigation, two defense supply service
workers and two other people were ordered to pay nearly $1 million in
restitution and fees for misusing purchase cards. Three of the four also
received prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   Zakheim could not provide an estimate of how much taxpayers have lost
because of purchase card abuse, but he said it's been more than offset by
the savings the cards have produced by streamlining the purchasing
process throughout the Defense Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is not to eliminate the cards," he said. "That is going
backward. That is detrimental to government and Defense Department
efficiency. What we've got to do is prevent misuse."</TE>

<HD>IRS Eases Rules on Donations</HD>
<DH>Charities: The agency is giving taxpayers who made Sept. 11-related
contributions more time to get documentation from overwhelmed
organizations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taxpayers who donated money after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
but who have yet to receive an acknowledgment of their charitable
contributions have six more months to try to document their generosity,
the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS said it is loosening the paperwork rules because charities
have been so overwhelmed by donations that many have fallen far behind in
sending out acknowledgment letters.</LD>
<LD>   Taxpayers who donate $250 or more normally are required to have a
letter or e-mail from the charity acknowledging the gift before claiming
a deduction on their individual tax returns. This documentation is not
filed with the return, but by IRS rules must be kept in the taxpayer's
files.</LD>
<TE>   The IRS now says taxpayers who made contributions between Sept. 11 and
Dec. 31, 2001, can claim a deduction on their 2001 returns as long as
they get the documentation by Oct. 15 or show a "good-faith effort" that
they tried to obtain it.</TE>
<TE>   Such efforts could include a letter or e-mail to the charity, with a
copy kept for the taxpayer's files, the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   Americans have flooded charities with more than $2 billion in Sept.
11-related donations, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, and
many smaller or newly formed nonprofits are struggling to send out
charitable receipts to donors. The IRS said nearly 300 new charities
sprang up after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest charities have automated the process of sending
out contribution acknowledgments, tax experts said. Some--such as the
American Red Cross--send out receipts within seconds of receiving an
online contribution on its Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers are supposed to present this documentation if their return
is audited. Canceled checks aren't considered sufficient documentation,
tax experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules affect only the one-third of Americans who itemize
deductions, because only taxpayers who itemize are allowed to write off
charitable contributions. Although President Bush is in favor of allowing
such deductions for all taxpayers, Congress has yet to concur.</TE>
<TE>   Documentation isn't required for donations of less than $250, or for a
series of smaller donations that add up to more than $250--such as a
weekly contribution of $25 to a church or synagogue, tax experts said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the latest year for which IRS statistics are available,
Americans claimed $126 billion in deductions to charities, an average of
$3,100 for each taxpayer who itemized.</TE>
<TE>   Even though most Americans don't itemize, more than 90% of American
households donate to charities, according to the Chronicle of
Philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   The change in charitable donation rules is the latest IRS effort to
accommodate taxpayers who have struggled after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers who lived or worked in the disaster area, or whose tax
documents were destroyed when the World Trade Center buildings collapsed,
were given extra time to file and pay taxes, such as quarterly estimated
tax payments, that were due last year.</TE>
<TE>   The disaster area included New York and Arlington County in Virginia,
home of the Pentagon.</TE>

<HD>Deal Will Help Get Wolves Back Into the Wilderness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>Officials working to reintroduce the endangered Mexican gray wolf
into the wild signed an agreement Wednesday with members of the White
Mountain Apache Indian tribe to let as many as six wolf packs roam over
1.5 million acres of Indian land.</LD>
<LD>   There are thought to be 30 reintroduced wolves in the wilds of Arizona
and New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   "The reservation provides a much-needed sanctuary for wolves that are
having a difficult time surviving," said Craig Miller, regional director
of Defenders of Wildlife, a national wildlife conservation organization.
"Humans are shooting these wolves. The reservation has far fewer humans
and fewer chances for conflicts."</LD>
<TE>   Many ranchers consider the 4-year-old program a failure that causes
headaches for them and misery for unprepared wolves let loose in a harsh
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The wolves, raised in captivity and unprepared for life in the wild,
are being released into areas traditionally used by ranchers, said C.B.
Lane, director of natural resources for the Arizona Cattle Feeders Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they really thought about what they were doing when
they started this thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican gray wolf, a German shepherd-sized predator that once
roamed the U.S. Southwest and central Mexico, was hunted to the brink of
extinction in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 200 or so wolves left in the world, most are housed in breeding
programs in U.S. and Mexican zoos and wildlife sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   While ranchers complain that the wolves kill livestock and raid
garbage and pet food, Miller said the 30 animals thought to be in the
wild have successfully established pairs, reproduced and hunted on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   "Biologically, this program exceeds our expectations," he said. "The
biggest problem has been the conscious decision by a few humans to
slaughter these animals."</TE>

<HD>New Diabetes Screenings Urged for Older Citizens</HD>
<DH>Health: Renaming a type of high blood sugar comes as stepped-up
efforts are announced to reduce burgeoning cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Overweight Americans age 45 and older should be screened regularly
for a condition now being called "pre-diabetes" and take steps, if
needed, to prevent the full-blown onset of the potentially devastating
disease, top U.S. health officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Every year a person can live free of diabetes means an added year
free of the pain, disability and medical costs of this disease," Health
and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said.</LD>
<LD>   The renaming of a type of high blood sugar previously called "impaired
glucose tolerance" came as Thompson announced stepped-up efforts to
reduce what health care experts view as an epidemic of diabetes, with
cases tripling in the last 30 years.</LD>
<TE>   Health officials believe that using the term "pre-diabetes" might help
to focus attention on the serious risk many individuals are facing. The
condition often goes undetected and poses increased risk for
cardiovascular disease, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At least 16 million Americans age 40 to 74 are estimated to fall into
the pre-diabetes category, in addition to 17 million already suffering
from Type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials said those younger than 45 who are overweight and
have other risk factors--such as African American, Latino or Native
American heritage or a family member with diabetes--should consult with a
doctor about getting screened.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike childhood-onset, or Type 1, diabetes, Type 2 usually develops
in adults whose bodies can no longer properly turn blood sugar into
energy. It often is brought on by obesity. As the disease progresses,
patients are at risk for blindness, kidney failure, amputation of limbs
because of inadequate blood flow or infection, and heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, Thompson and diabetes experts said Wednesday, is that
recent studies indicate that the disease can be delayed--and perhaps even
stopped altogether--by simple diet changes, modest weight loss and
regular moderate exercise.</TE>
<TE>   National Institutes of Health research has shown that such lifestyle
changes reduce by nearly 60% the number of pre-diabetes sufferers who
eventually develop the more serious disease.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frank Vinicor, director of the diabetes program at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, warned that,
without aggressive steps to reduce rates of the disease, the medical
system "could soon be overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   The screening procedures recommended Wednesday by HHS, CDC and NIH,
however, are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid, officials said.
Minority communities, considered to be among the most at risk, also have
higher numbers of uninsured individuals, another hurdle to preventive
care.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said he planned to work with insurance companies, employers
and others to convince them that the tests, which cost about $25 each,
would be well worth the expense.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the government's message of better nutrition and a
healthier lifestyle could compete with constant advertisements for fast
food, Thompson conceded that the effort would not be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend way too little," he said when asked about how the
government's efforts compare with those of a company such as fast-food
giant McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter," Thompson said, "is that in America we spend
a lot of money once people get sick trying to get them better again. If
we focused on prevention, we'd all be better off."</TE>

<DL>NORFOLK, Va.
</DL>
<LD>The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, one of the first ships
sent abroad in the U.S. war on terrorism, docked Wednesday after a
six-month mission, sending crew members streaming ashore into the tearful
embraces of family members.</LD>
<LD>   Rain and a blustery wind failed to wash out the festive atmosphere at
Norfolk Naval Station's Pier 14, where thousands hailed the return of the
warship from a 189-day deployment.</LD>
<LD>   "USA! USA! USA!" the throng chanted as the first carrier to deploy
after Sept. 11 was nudged into the pier by tugboats. Many waved and wept
before the crew left the ship.</LD>
<TE>   Sailors with American flags waved back from the deck of the 1,092-foot
carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have 30 ships out there and thousands of shipmates who
continue to do the job," said Adm. Robert J. Natter, commander in chief
of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. "The answer to this [the war on terrorism] is
not, have we captured Osama bin Laden . . . but rather keeping them on
the defensive, keeping them running. We are winning."</TE>
<TE>   Among those welcoming the sailors at the pier were Secretary of the
Navy Gordon England and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).</TE>
<TE>   The ship flew the flag of New York City as it pulled alongside the
pier. A banner, fashioned from a bedsheet, proclaimed: "Freedom Endures."</TE>
<TE>   The Roosevelt launched 60 to 80 combat flights a day into Afghanistan,
and the ship's aviators routinely flew 14 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   "We helped deter terrorism," said Capt. Stephen S. Voetsch, commander
of the carrier air wing.</TE>
<TE>   The Roosevelt departed Norfolk Sept. 19.</TE>
<TE>   At a tent for crewmen who are new fathers, Lt. Cmdr. Carther Jorgensen
cradled his 4-month old son, Alexander Charles, each smiling broadly at
the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so glad I'm home. It seems he knew who I was. He smiled,"
Jorgensen said.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Country singer Lyle Lovett was trampled by a bull and broke his leg
Wednesday while trying to help an uncle who had just been flipped by the
animal.</LD>
<LD>   Lovett had surgery on his right leg Wednesday night, said Memorial
Hermann Hospital spokeswoman Beth Sartori. "He was in good condition on
arrival," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Lovett, 44, was injured on his uncle's farm in suburban Houston. A
bull reportedly flipped Lovett's uncle Calvin Klein, 67, and Lovett was
trampled while trying to help him.</LD>
<TE>   Klein was taken to Tomball Regional Hospital suffering from chest pain
trauma. He underwent X-rays and a CT scan, all of which were clear, said
hospital spokeswoman Karen Frye.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett suffered a compound fracture to his lower right leg, just below
the kneecap, hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Lovett's hits include "If I Were the Man You Wanted" and "San Antonio
Girl."</TE>

<HD>Enola Gay Log, Other Papers Sold</HD>
<DH>History: A manuscript of Lincoln's last speech fetches more than $3
million, a record. Forbes family sells 201 in all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>"My God what have we done."</LD>
<LD>   The Enola Gay co-pilot's log book recording the horror of having just
dropped the first atomic bomb in war was the most chilling item on
auction Wednesday in a sale of U.S. historical documents that fetched
record prices.</LD>
<LD>   An autographed manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's last speech, delivered
from the window of the White House three days before his assassination in
1865, was sold for $3,086,000--the most ever for a U.S. historical
document.</LD>
<TE>   Albert Einstein's letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning
him of the potential for "the construction of extremely powerful bombs,"
which helped launch U.S. research leading to the development of the
atomic bomb, was sold for $2.10 million, a record price for a letter.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of 201 American historical documents from the Forbes
Collection, which was started by the late financial publisher Malcolm
Forbes and is now controlled by his sons, yielded more than $20 million
and saw record prices paid for items from 14 different presidents, said
Chris Coover of Christie's books and manuscripts department.</TE>
<TE>   The winning bid for Capt. Robert Lewis' log chronicling the "Little
Boy" mission that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945,
was $350,000--more than the estimated range of $200,000 to $300,000 but
far short of the record prices paid for some of the other documents on
sale.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a uniquely important document," dealer Seth Kaller said about
the Enola Gay log. "It's one of the greatest moments, but one of the most
terrible, of the century.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terribly sad record. I think that affects the desire to own
it."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis's minute-by-minute account of the mission written in pen and
pencil during the flight was full of details of the bombing run aimed at
bringing a fast end to the Second World War. It also was filled with awe
after the 9,000-pound bomb, dubbed "Little Boy," was dropped over
Hiroshima.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed that more than 140,000 people died by the end of the
year as a result of the bomb. The total number of people who died due to
the bomb has been estimated at 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis wrote that "15 seconds after the flash there were two very
distinct slaps (air turbulence) that was all the physical effects we
felt. We then turned the ship so we could observe results, and there in
front of our eyes was without a doubt the greatest explosion man has ever
witnessed.</TE>
<TE>   "The city was nine-tenths covered with smoke . . . and a column of
white cloud, which in less than 3 mins, reached 30,000 feet and then went
up to 50,000 . . . "</TE>
<TE>   Lewis continued: "I am certain the entire crew felt this experience
was more than anyone human had ever thought possible. It just seems
impossible to comprehend. Just how many did we kill? I honestly have the
feeling of groping for words to explain this or I might say My God what
have we done.</TE>
<TE>   "If I live a hundred years I'll never quite get those few minutes out
of my mind . . . "</TE>
<TE>   He added that the massive cloud left by the blast was still visible
"even after an hour and a half, 400 miles from the target."</TE>
<TE>   The front page of the 11-page document has "Dear Mom and Dad," and at
the end come the words, "Love to all/Bud." The Brooklyn, N.Y. pilot
apparently feared the log might be confiscated because of strict security
over the mission.</TE>

<HD>Millions of Smallpox Vaccine Doses Found</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A pharmaceutical company has discovered 70 million to 90 million
long-forgotten doses of smallpox vaccine in its freezers, instantly
increasing the known U.S. inventory of the vaccine sixfold and ensuring
the nation an adequate supply in the event of a bioterrorist attack,
according to government sources familiar with the find.</LD>
<LD>   The immediate impact of the discovery is to buy time for the federal
government and its pharmaceutical contractors, which together have been
racing to produce tens of millions of smallpox vaccine doses as part of
the new biodefense initiative. Companies will be able use that cushion of
time to fine-tune some of the new vaccine candidates under development,
instead of rushing effective but perhaps less-than-perfect vaccines into
production as an emergency stopgap measure.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great insurance policy," said D.A. Henderson, director of the
newly created federal Office of Health Preparedness.</LD>
<TE>   The liquid vaccine doses were produced by Aventis Pasteur of Lyon,
France, which has its U.S. operations in Swiftwater, Pa. The vaccine has
been stored in freezers since it was made decades ago, sources said. It
remained unclear why its existence had gone undiscovered for so long,
exactly when it was discovered or by whom.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the company is negotiating with the Department of Health
and Human Services with the goal of giving the U.S. government access to
the supply. Among the issues to be worked out are how much money, if any,
would change hands in the transaction, and the extent to which the
company may be relieved of liability should problems with the vaccine
arise.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Aventis were referred to HHS, which volunteered few details.</TE>
<TE>   "There are legal things that still need to be finalized," said HHS
spokesman Bill Hall. HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson hopes to settle the
deal before next week, Hall said. "Until then, our hands are tied."</TE>
<TE>   A global vaccination effort rid the world of naturally occurring
smallpox in 1977, after which the vaccine fell out of production. But a
few vials of smallpox viruses were saved in the United States and the
Soviet Union. Some experts fear that small amounts of the highly
infectious, often fatal agent--which can be expanded with relative ease
in a laboratory--may have fallen into terrorist hands.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that smallpox might reemerge as an agent of terror
recently inspired U.S. health officials to take stock of existing vaccine
supplies. That inventory concluded that the nation has about 15.4 million
doses--barely enough to deal with an attack on a major city or two.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Joint Chiefs Chairman Shelton Will Need Back Surgery After Fall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Retired Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, is recovering well from a fall but will need spinal cord
surgery, Walter Reed Army Medical Center said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton "is showing some gradual improvement" and isn't having any
problems with his speech or breathing, a hospital statement said.</LD>
<LD>   "He is now able to stand with assistance but is still experiencing
weakness in his right leg and both arms," the hospital said.</LD>
<TE>   Shelton was moved Wednesday from the intensive care unit to a general
patient ward. No date was scheduled for the surgery. He suffered a spinal
injury when he fell off a ladder Saturday at his home in a Virginia
suburb outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton, 62, stepped down as Joint Chiefs chairman Oct. 1, just before
the United States began bombing Afghanistan. He had served 38 years in
the Army, the last four as the top military advisor to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam and was a member of the
service's Special Forces. He was assistant division commander of
operations for the 101st Airborne Division during the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.</TE>

<HD>Plan Would Cost Milwaukee a House Seat</HD>
<DH>Politics: Redistricting would leave the capital with one
representative for the first time in more than a century.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Scott McCallum signed into law a measure that carves Wisconsin
into eight congressional districts instead of its current nine, lopping
off one U.S. House seat for Milwaukee, the state's largest city.</LD>
<LD>   McCallum spokesman Tim Roby said Wednesday the plan can't be
implemented until a lawsuit is resolved that had asked a panel of federal
judges to redraw congressional lines.</LD>
<LD>   McCallum signed the plan late Tuesday. It was filed with the secretary
of state Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   A group of black Democratic lawmakers from Milwaukee said they may sue
to derail the plan. They favor an alternative map that would preserve the
city's two congressional districts.</TE>
<TE>   State Rep. Polly Williams said the plan ignores minority voters in
Milwaukee and strengthens incumbents planning to run in the new districts
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We just feel that we need to fight to maintain as much representation
in Washington as we possibly can," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Four Republicans and four Democrats are running for reelection this
year. The seat being lost is held by Rep. Thomas M. Barrett, a Democrat
who is running for governor and was not seeking reelection to the House.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin is losing one district because the state did not grow as
fast as others over the last decade. The redistricting plan would end
more than 100 years of Milwaukee being represented by at least two
members of the U.S. House.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the city of Milwaukee, four of its suburbs and part of
a nearby city would make up a single congressional district.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate approved the plan two weeks ago. The state Assembly
approved it last month.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers must redraw political boundaries every decade to reflect
population shifts recorded in the U.S. Census. Their plans can be
challenged in court.</TE>
<TE>   A group of citizens led by prominent Democrats such as former Gov.
Tony Earl sued in federal court last year, asking a three-judge panel to
redraw congressional lines, arguing that state lawmakers would be unable
to reach an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys involved in the case said the judges, who set a trial for
next week, were likely to dismiss the lawsuit since McCallum signed the
plan into law.</TE>
<TE>   The court scheduled a separate trial to lawmakers' failure to redraw
legislative districts.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Assailed on Exhibit's Abortion-Holocaust Linkage</HD>

<DL>BOISE, Idaho
</DL>
<LD>A Jewish community leader is criticizing a Catholic bishop for
backing a graphic photo display that links abortion with the Holocaust
and racial violence.</LD>
<LD>   The planned display is offensive to Jews and others, said Rabbi Daniel
Fink of Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Catholic Bishop Michael Driscoll, Fink said the display
is, "racist, anti-Semitic and extremely offensive."</LD>
<TE>   The 12 photos, each 8 feet wide by 4 feet high, depict aborted fetuses
alongside corpses in Nazi death camps and black lynching victims.
Captions make such analogies as: "Ungentile, Unwhite, Unborn" and
"Religious Choice, Racial Choice, Reproductive Choice."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit by an antiabortion group, the Center for Bio-Ethical
Reform of Anaheim, is scheduled for April 8-12 at Boise State University.
A university official defended the school's decision to allow the
exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Driscoll said he found nothing objectionable with the images, because
while they are "gruesome," so is abortion.</TE>

<HD>Belated Honor for Gay Teachers Expelled in 1960</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORTHAMPTON, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>Four decades after Smith College dismissed three gay professors who
were caught up in a sex scandal but later exonerated, the school is
honoring the men with a scholarship and a program on civil liberties.</LD>
<LD>   Some say the college owes them more, including an apology. But the two
surviving professors are not expecting it.</LD>
<LD>   "If they gave me money, that would be nifty," said Edward Spofford,
one of the professors. "But if they did that or gave us a formal apology,
they might be compromising their position if we ever wanted to sue them.
I'm sure they don't want to admit any wrongdoing."</LD>
<TE>   Smith did not renew its contracts with Spofford and Joel Dorius after
they were convicted in 1960 for possessing pornography. A third
professor--and the only one with tenure--Newton Arvin, was allowed to
retire after his conviction on the same charge. All three were exonerated
by the state's highest court by 1963, the year Arvin died.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's board of trustees voted last month to create the
Dorius/Spofford Fund for the Study of Civil Liberties and Freedom of
Expression, a $100,000 fund that will pay for lectures, research and
programs on civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   The board also created the Newton Arvin Prize in American Studies, a
$500 annual scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Despite appeals from faculty and community members, the board did not
apologize.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of my colleagues were interested in an apology or expression of
regret," said Jefferson Hunter, chairman of the faculty council. "The
reason the board gave us was that it wouldn't be right to apologize
because no one could know what really happened 40 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Both Spofford and Dorius continued teaching after leaving Smith.
Spofford, 70, retired from Stanford University in 1988. Dorius, 83,
retired from San Francisco State University in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Smith spokeswoman Laurie Fenlason said the board's action was prompted
by "The Scarlet Professor," a book by Northampton author Barry Werth
about the professors' dismissal. When the book was published last year,
Werth proposed that the college apologize.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody said they weren't good teachers. They were fired because they
were perceived as dirty men," Werth said. "There was a real purity binge
going on throughout the state at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Newman, head of the American Civil Liberties Union's western
Massachusetts office, called the civil liberties program and scholarship
fund an "unimpressive pittance."</TE>
<TE>   But Dorius said: "I think it's all quite remarkable. After more than
40 years of doing somebody in, they up and acknowledge what happened."</TE>

<HD>Pupils Improperly Strip-Searched for Missing Money, Mo. District
Says</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>School district officials said Wednesday an investigation has
confirmed that a group of third-grade students were improperly
strip-searched for missing lunch money.</LD>
<LD>   According to parents, at least two teachers at Pitcher Elementary
searched 23 students for $5 in missing lunch money March 18. The money
was eventually found, though not through the searches.</LD>
<LD>   The school's principal and two teachers were suspended last week.
School district spokesman Edwin Birch said they remained suspended, but
said state law prohibited him from talking about any other disciplinary
action they face.</LD>
<TE>   District officials said in a written statement and in a letter to
parents that the searches were "an egregious violation" of policy and
that the conduct of the adults was "abhorrent."</TE>
<TE>   Parents have said a female third-grade teacher took the girls to a
restroom, then had them pair up in stalls, where they were told to check
each other's underwear.</TE>
<TE>   A male physical education teacher took the boys to the gymnasium where
each was told to strip and shake his underwear, parents said.</TE>

<HD>New Theory in Anthrax Death Looks at Ripped-Up Junk Mail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>The 94-year-old Connecticut woman who died of inhalation anthrax
last fall may have been infected by ripping her junk mail in half,
releasing deadly spores into the air, health officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators have never given a conclusive explanation for Ottilie
Lundgren's death Nov. 21, one of five after anthrax-laden letters were
mailed to media and political offices in the fall. But they have long
suspected mail cross-contamination.</LD>
<LD>   About 80% of Lundgren's mail was bulk delivery, some of which passed
through the same Trenton, N.J., postal facility that handled contaminated
letters sent to Sens. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.),
said Connecticut's state epidemiologist, Dr. James Hadler.</LD>
<TE>   Lundgren's habit of tearing junk mail in half before discarding it may
have released enough spores into the air to infect her, Hadler said at a
conference held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Testing at Lundgren's home and places she visited turned up no anthrax
spores.</TE>

<HD>Official Possibly Tied to Inquiry Threatens Suicide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLLINSVILLE, Va.
</DL>
<LD>An outspoken administrator who has tried for years to rebuild Henry
County's ailing economy was found in the woods threatening suicide as
police searched his office as part of an embezzlement probe.</LD>
<LD>   Sid Clower, 50, the county's top official, remained hospitalized for
undisclosed reasons Wednesday, a day after deputies said they had to
wrestle a loaded handgun away from him.</LD>
<LD>   "He was pretty distraught," Sheriff Frank Cassell said. "He kept
apologizing for putting us through all the trouble."</LD>
<TE>   By the time officers took Clower on Tuesday, state police had arrived
at the county administration building with search warrants, seizing
computer hard drives from Clower's and other offices.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Don Caldwell said the search was part of an investigation
into alleged embezzlement of public funds in Henry County.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Caldwell nor state police would comment about the
investigation. Cassell and county officials said Wednesday that there had
been no arrests in the case.</TE>
<TE>   News of the suicide attempt shocked many county officials.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were to list all the people in this building that would do
something like that, he would be at the bottom," said Benny Summerlin,
the county's deputy administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Clower, the county's leader since 1996, has complained that federal
trade agreements were killing traditional manufacturing communities like
his because companies could now freely move oversees for cheaper labor.</TE>
<TE>   Clower voluntarily cut his $110,000 salary by 10% last year because of
declining tax revenue in a county hit hard by the slump in the textile
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Once known as the "Sweatshirt Capital of the World," Henry County has
seen 21 factories closed and 10 others downsized since 1993, forcing more
than 9,300 people out of work.</TE>
<TE>   VF Imagewear, the county's largest employer, announced in November
that it would lay off about 2,300 textile workers in the region.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Summerlin opened an envelope from Clower that he said
"concluded with several sentences that made me really concerned about his
well being."</TE>
<TE>   A search of the county building didn't turn up Clower and officials
called the sheriff's office. Clower was found two hours later a mile away
in a wooded area.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody answered the door at Clower's home in Collinsville. His wife,
Elaine, issued a statement Wednesday through county officials:</TE>
<TE>   "Please continue to pray for us. The love and concern the community
has shown us is greatly appreciated," it said.</TE>

<HD>Antidepressant Drug Use Jumps 62% Among Youths, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The use of blockbuster antidepressant drugs such as Prozac and
Zoloft soared in the late 1990s among young people, the first government
study of its type found.</LD>
<LD>   Prescription drug use among people 20 years old and younger jumped 62%
from 1995 to 1999, according to research by the U.S. Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality, the government body that tracks health
treatments.</LD>
<LD>   The increase raises questions about the definition of "problem
behavior" among children and teens, the authors said.</LD>
<TE>   "Given the potential emotional and developmental impact of
psychotropic medication for the vulnerable populations of children and
adolescents," society should examine how it treats delinquency, the
authors wrote in this week's issue of Ambulatory Pediatrics.</TE>
<TE>   Teens aged 15 to 19 are most likely to be given these antidepressants,
followed by children aged 10 to 14, according to the data. Girls are
prescribed the drugs slightly more often than boys.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer psychologists and more family doctors are prescribing the drugs,
the study found. Those doctors may be unfamiliar with symptoms of
depression and may be over-prescribing the drugs, said Deborah Shatin,
the primary author of the study.</TE>

<HD>Shark Attack Victim 'Saved Himself,' Nurse Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>A Colorado couple vacationing on Kauai said Wednesday they thought
at first the shark that attacked a body boarder and bit off his foot was
a dolphin.</LD>
<LD>   Nancy Roberts, the nurse credited with helping save 17-year-old Hoku
Aki's life Monday, said it didn't take long for the shark to attack the
teenager.</LD>
<LD>   "My husband stands up and says, 'Look at the dolphin, it's in so
close,' " Nancy Roberts told the Honolulu Advertiser from her home in
Littleton, Colo. "Then he jumped up and said, 'It's not a dolphin, it's a
shark.'</LD>
<TE>   "He wasn't in the water five minutes before this happened," she said.
"My husband . . . saw the shark bite him and then roll him once."</TE>
<TE>   After Aki freed himself from the shark, David Roberts coaxed him to
shore.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Come on, you can do it, you're strong, you can make it,
you're going to be OK,' " Nancy Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see the stream of blood following behind him," she said. "I
was just trying to encourage him that he was going to be OK, and help was
on the way, and he did the right thing by following our instructions,"
Nancy Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Aki, who lost his left foot and ankle in the attack, credited an
unnamed nurse with saving his life in television interviews Tuesday from
his bed at Wilcox Memorial Hospital on Kauai. He was later transferred to
The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu, where he was in fair condition
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Robertses and their son, Spencer, 13, were on the beach when they
saw the attack.</TE>
<TE>   David Roberts and a friend, Brian Hanson, helped bring Aki onto the
beach to begin medical treatment while Spencer ran for help.</TE>
<TE>   Aki was going into shock and kept saying he had difficulty breathing,
Nancy Roberts said. The Kauai Fire Department arrived first and handed
her a tourniquet, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he needed help desperately," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Roberts said she didn't think she was a hero.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone would have done what I did.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just so thankful that he's OK," she said. "I have children of my
own. I cannot even imagine going through something like that. The whole
incident seemed so surreal to me. He saved himself. He was very brave and
very strong. We're so proud of him."</TE>

<HD>TV Ads Seek Farm Workers Who Are Due Pensions</HD>
<DH>Labor: Lt. Gov. Bustamante joins with UFW in trying to get
the word out to people who likely don't even know they are eligible.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to reach former farm laborers who are owed pension
benefits, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and the United Farm Workers are
trying a new approach: public service television ads in English and
Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   Bustamante, who will begin recording the advertisements today,
said he offered to help the UFW in the union's efforts to reach the
thousands of aging farm workers who are eligible for pension funds.
Only those farm laborers who worked under a UFW contract are entitled
to the money, but UFW officials estimate that could be about 2,000
people.</LD>
<LD>   "This could change their life fundamentally," said Bustamante, who
is running for reelection against state Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa
Cruz). "Farm workers ... were never treated like regular workers.
They never thought they could receive retirement [funds]. We need to
get the word out."</LD>
<TE>   The Juan de la Cruz Farm Workers Pension Plan, established more
than 30 years ago by union founder Cesar Chavez, is the nation's
first and only pension program for farm workers. It is named for a
60-year-old farm worker who was fatally shot in a Kern County
vineyard picket line in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Grossman, spokesman for the UFW, said the union has tried
various ways to reach the former workers, but added that they are
proving difficult to find. Many used multiple Social Security numbers
to skirt immigration laws, they moved frequently and many don't even
know they are eligible for the money.</TE>
<TE>   "We have skeletal records," Grossman said. "We've done an
extensive Spanish-language campaign here and in Mexico. But there's a
fairly significant number of people who are entitled to benefits and
we don't know where to find them.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, the UFW must make a reasonable effort to find
those eligible for the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, UFW officials say dozens of former farm workers
have received the pension funds. One 86-year-old man in Watsonville
received more than $73,000 last year. He had no idea he was eligible.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a person here who has long since retired, thinking he
has no kind of pension plan," Bustamante said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The UFW has established two toll-free numbers for former farm
workers who believe they may be eligible for the money. The numbers
are: (888) 735-5352 and (800) 321-6607.</TE>

<HD>3 Bodies Are Found Near Beach</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Two women and one man are discovered shot to
death on a cliff north of Santa Cruz. Suicide pact or homicide is
suspected.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Investigators tried to determine Wednesday whether the shotgun deaths
of three people found on a cliff overlooking a secluded beach were
the result of a suicide pact or a homicide.</LD>
<LD>   A group walking above Bonny Doon Beach just north of Santa Cruz
discovered the bodies of two women and a man about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   They were identified as David Bachman, 26, Melinda Leippe, 19, and
Brenda White, 19, all of Littleton, Colo.</LD>
<TE>   The women had been shot in the chest and Bachman in the head,
Santa Cruz County sheriff's spokesman Kim Allyn said. A shotgun lay
near the bodies, which were in a circle.</TE>
<TE>   There were no signs of struggle and no suicide note, Allyn said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators remained at the scene overnight and removed the
bodies about noon Wednesday. They also towed from the beach's parking
lot a white car with Colorado license plates that may have belonged
to one of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The horseshoe-shaped beach, about 7 miles north of Santa Cruz,
sits below two rocky bluffs. The public has free access to the
privately owned beach, which is known for nude sunbathing and rave
parties. Authorities are called there periodically on reports of drug
use, sexual assaults and violence.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Won't Block Bond Sale</HD>
<DH>Energy: The utility is still concerned about the state
charging its customers, but it says it will not stop the deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California's long-delayed effort to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to
finance its costs during the energy crisis could proceed within
months now that Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. has said it does not
intend to interfere with the deal.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to state Treasurer Phil Angelides, Gordon R. Smith,
PG&amp;E's chief executive, said this week that although the utility is
concerned about the state's plans to charge PG&amp;E customers for
electricity the state purchased, it will not block the bond deal.</LD>
<LD>   The declaration is significant because PG&amp;E was widely assumed to
be the most likely party to derail the energy bond sale by
challenging the Public Utilities Commission's rate decisions in
court.</LD>
<TE>   Angelides hailed the letter Wednesday but cautioned that many
other details need to fall into place before he will take the massive
bond deal to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Even when all legal and procedural hurdles are cleared, Angelides
estimated that it would take 12 to 15 weeks to sell the bonds, and
added that he has never thought it could happen before the next
fiscal year begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good news, not bad news, and PG&amp;E has done the right
thing in the public interest," Angelides said. "The right course of
action is to not hold the state hostage" as PG&amp;E haggles over
differences with the state.</TE>
<TE>   California, which is facing a $17.5-billion budget shortfall,
needs to complete the bond sale to pay back the state treasury for
more than $6 billion the state spent on electricity. The state
entered the power business last year after private utilities ran into
financial trouble during the power crunch and could no longer afford
to supply their customers.</TE>
<TE>   The financing also will allow the state to pay off a $4.3-billion
loan it took out last year to stop the drain of the crisis on the
general fund. And it is intended to help the state meet its
$43-billion long-term commitment to purchase electricity as a means
of stabilizing the power market and preventing blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are to be paid off by customers of the private utilities
over 10 to 15 years.</TE>

<HD>Sale of Common Weedkiller Banned</HD>
<DH>Environment: Officials act after clopyralid, which can kill
garden crops, is found to taint the state's green-waste recycling
facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California environmental officials Wednesday banned the sale of lawn
care products containing the weedkiller clopyralid.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, effective in 30 days, comes after testing indicated
that compost made at as many as 75 of California's 100 green-waste
recycling facilities may be contaminated by the chemical.</LD>
<LD>   The weedkiller, made by Dow AgroSciences, is not toxic to human or
mammals, and is used to kill clover, dandelions and thistles. It gets
into compost when clippings from treated lawns are put in green-waste
bins for curbside collection, then taken to state facilities for
recycling. The grass is broken down into compost and sold to farmers,
landscapers and home gardeners.</LD>
<TE>   The product has been viewed as wholesome enough to be used as a
soil conditioner for organic growers.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1999, compost tainted with clopyralid began killing
"nontarget" vegetables, including petunias, daisies, tomatoes and
potatoes in Pennsylvania and Washington state. Washington State
University scientists traced the problem to products containing
clopyralid.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, testing revealed contamination in 90% of the state's
compost. On March 1, the Washington State Department of Agriculture
responded with an emergency ban on use of the chemical in lawn-care
products.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, the Sonoma-based California Quality Compost
Coalition, a trade association of green-waste recycling companies,
reported only slightly less sweeping contamination of compost in
California: 13 of 20 sites tested showed a trace of the chemical. In
Southern California, both the San Diego and the Los Angeles Bureau of
Sanitation have been reporting positive tests since June. Both city
governments are now warning customers that their compost may be
contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Grealy, San Diego's recycling program supervisor, welcomes
the ban. "I think that's an excellent first step," he said. "But
there are many composting facilities in California that also receive
agricultural waste."</TE>
<TE>   Grealy warned that even with swift removal of the product from
store shelves, it will take time to clean up compost. "We will still
see a lingering problem because of the residual activity, I expect,
for many months to come."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Dow AgroSciences said the company was caught off
guard by the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be getting back to Department of Pesticide Regulation in
the near future with a more detailed response," spokesman Garry
Hamlin said.</TE>
<TE>   The weedkillers affected by the ban include:</TE>
<TE>   * The Andersons Lawn Fertilizer (Tee Time 18-5-9 With Millennium
Ultra Herbicide, United Horticultural Supply Professional Turf
Products 22-3-4 With Millennium Ultra, the Andersons Professional

<HD>Taking Proposal for Development to the People</HD>
<DH>Land use: Property owners seek a ballot spot for their
1,390-home hillside project, where a slow-growth ordinance requires
voter approval of the plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By a 3-to-1 margin, Ventura voters empowered themselves last fall to
block future hillside development.</LD>
<LD>   Slow-growth activists crafted a ballot initiative that effectively
prohibits the City Council from approving hillside projects. The
measure requires voters' approval to extend city services into the
hilly areas north of downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Activists had hoped the ordinance might even persuade would-be
developers to drop their plans altogether.</LD>
<TE>   But 300 heirs to the Lloyd and Dabney families' property aren't
walking away just yet. Instead, they have decided to test the city's
newest growth-control ordinance by taking their 1,390-home proposal
to voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the ballot initiative would allow the landowners to
proceed with the development in exchange for placing 80% of their
3,800 acres into permanent open space. To get the measure on the
ballot, they will need about 9,000 signatures from city voters.</TE>
<TE>   If voters reject the plan, the owners say they may simply sell the
land piecemeal. A sliver of it, already inside city limits, does not
need voters' approval for hundreds of homes. Other pieces might be
graded for farming. Or sold to oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think those things are the best for the community or even
for the family," said Jim Anderson, a Los Angeles consultant
representing the landowners. "But it's not going to remain as it is.
The family has gotten to the point where it needs to divest."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Lewis Lloyd of Missouri settled in Ventura in 1886.
One of his sons and the son's partner, Joseph Dabney, were oilmen and
ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Similar struggles are playing out elsewhere in Ventura County in
response to the slow-growth movement that has taken hold over the
past five years.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, a developer is planning a November ballot
initiative that would allow expansion into a canyon that residents
two years ago had voted out of the city's growth boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   And in Simi Valley, the City Council is considering launching a
fall ballot measure to compete against a plan to rein in the city's
growth boundaries. Tighter boundaries could derail plans for a
1,600-home development and business park north of that city.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, the Lloyd-Dabney heirs have hired researchers to gauge
public sentiment and determine how best to pitch their development
concept. Anderson declined to share the results of the study.</TE>
<TE>   While landowners envision six new neighborhoods in the
hills--Midtown Heights, Hall Canyon, Poinsettia Terrace, Foothill
Heights, Sexton Canyon and Sexton Canyon Estates--they have named
their ballot campaign the "Open 80 Plan," a reference to the
percentage of land to be set aside for conservation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have slick fliers in color saying they are big proponents of
open space," said Martha Zeiher, president of the opposition group
Ventura Citizens for Hillside Preservation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to attempt to sell it to the public that way," she
said, quipping, "It's not 'Open 80,' it's 'Build 1,390.'"</TE>
<TE>   Zeiher and other opponents predict the homes would increase
pollution and traffic, strain water supplies, harm wildlife and
disturb the aesthetic of the sage-covered hills. Furthermore, they
say the city needs more affordable housing, not upscale single-family
plots.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson rejects those arguments and said there is a demand for
hillside homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been this notion in Ventura that if there are no homes
built there will be no more people," he said. "That doesn't really
stop people from coming. It just causes pressures in other areas."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Anderson said, the landowners would be willing to sell
the whole package, including development rights, for the right price.
That's $15,000 per acre, or about $60 million, he said.</TE>

1,600-home development and business park north of that city.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, the Lloyd-Dabney heirs have hired researchers to gauge
public sentiment and determine how best to pitch their development
concept. Anderson declined to share the results of the study.</TE>
<TE>   While landowners envision six new neighborhoods in the
hills--Midtown Heights, Hall Canyon, Poinsettia Terrace, Foothill
Heights, Sexton Canyon and Sexton Canyon Estates--they have named
their ballot campaign the "Open 80 Plan," a reference to the
percentage of land to be set aside for conservation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have slick fliers in color saying they are big proponents of
open space," said Martha Zeiher, president of the opposition group
Ventura Citizens for Hillside Preservation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to attempt to sell it to the public that way," she
said, quipping, "It's not 'Open 80,' it's 'Build 1,390.'"</TE>
<TE>   Zeiher and other opponents predict the homes would increase
pollution and traffic, strain water supplies, harm wildlife and
disturb the aesthetic of the sage-covered hills.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, they say the city needs more affordable housing, not
upscale single-family plots.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson rejects those arguments and said there is a demand for
hillside homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been this notion in Ventura that if there are no homes
built there will be no more people," he said. "That doesn't really
stop people from coming. It just causes pressures in other areas."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Anderson said, the landowners would be willing to sell
the whole package, including development rights, for the right price.
That's $15,000 per acre, or about $60 million, he said.</TE>
<TE>   California voters earlier this month approved a $2.6-billion bond
measure that could be tapped to help purchase the properties.</TE>
<TE>   But Zeiher said the landowners' asking price is unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to purchase the whole thing from them," she said. "But
coming up with the money is no small task."</TE>

<HD>Davis: Let Migrants Drive</HD>
<DH>Policy: He supports issuing licenses for work-related
travel while also safeguarding public security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis said Wednesday he favors issuing California driver's
licenses to about 2 million undocumented immigrants but suggested the
licenses should be used only for work-related purposes.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe we can fashion a bill which gives people who have been
here for a while and are contributing to our economy the right to
drive to work, and does not compromise public security," Davis said.</LD>
<LD>   He declined to elaborate on his thinking about limiting driving
privileges. Currently, immigrants who cannot demonstrate that they
are legally in this country are not qualified for a permanent
driver's license.</LD>
<TE>   The governor, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles),
representatives of law enforcement and immigrant-rights advocates
have been trying since last summer to craft a compromise bill that
would allow illegal immigrants to get a driver's license, provided
they are seeking citizenship, have obtained a federal taxpayer
identification number and have made California their home.</TE>
<TE>   Davis supported such a bill last year, Cedillo's AB 60, but the
proposal evaporated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, when it was learned that some of the hijackers had obtained
fake driver's licenses in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who vetoed a similar bill in 2000, has refused to support
anything that might be perceived as relaxing California laws against
terrorism. But he has agreed now to seek a compromise that both
enables the immigrants to get a permanent driver's license and does
not jeopardize public safety.</TE>
<TE>   At an appearance Wednesday, Davis was asked about negotiations on
the driver's license bill. He said there has been progress toward a
compromise but repeated several times that qualified immigrants
should be given the "right to drive to work."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the driving privilege would be extended to other
circumstances such as going to a medical appointment or taking
children to school, Davis indicated again he favors restricting a
license to work situations.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor's words caught fellow Democrat Cedillo by
surprise. "We haven't seen that proposal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo said Californians want assurance that travel on the
highways is safe, that drivers are properly tested and insured and
that licensees are who they say they are and not criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people care whether a man is driving to work,
taking his family to church or to a medical appointment," Cedillo
said.</TE>

Merced, Calif., where retired sheriff's deputy John Hogan killed his
daughter and three of his ex-wife's children before shooting himself
to death on Tuesday. The slayings occurred in the exclusive Robinson
Estates area. The couple had been divorced for about a year.
Authorities had not come up with a motive for the murder-suicide.</CP>

<LD>A former prosecutor facing sentencing on felony assault charges
avoided jail time Wednesday when a judge reduced the charge to a
misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   Donald Schweitzer, a former deputy district attorney who now works
as a private lawyer, pleaded guilty to pummeling his estranged wife's
boyfriend last year as the man slept.</LD>
<LD>   He could have been sentenced to a year in jail and $5,000 in
fines, but Superior Court Judge Francisco Briseno put him on
probation instead and ordered him to go to counseling and an anger
management program. Schweitzer will have to serve time in jail if he
violates his probation, Briseno said.</LD>

<LD>Relief organizations, already strapped by demands in Afghanistan, are
busy redirecting supplies to the Hindu Kush region of that country,
where a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck this week.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County's large Afghan community struggled to deal with the
latest disaster. Laguna Niguel resident Fauzia Assifi, of the Afghan
Women's Assn. of Southern California, said the news has been
heartbreaking.</LD>
<LD>   "We are so overwhelmed," Assifi said. "I cried when I heard about
it. They're already in such horrible conditions and on top of it,
this?"</LD>
<TE>   Aftershocks and impassable roads hampered many of the efforts, and
officials with several Southern California-based organizations said
they are waiting for word from their teams in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We've sent a mobile team there to basically do triage and get a
sense of what the needs are," said Nancy Aossey, president and chief
executive officer of the Los Angeles-based International Medical
Corps.</TE>
<TE>   "Access is pretty limited and information is sketchy, but because
we're inside the country, we can mobilize pretty quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's earthquake--the second in a month in the mountainous
region--is stretching the resources of humanitarian aid organizations
already trying to deal with famine, homelessness, war and a cold
winter.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of the quake's death toll range from 800 to 2,000. The
earthquake left about 100,000 people homeless or without food.
Farshad Rastegar, chief executive of Relief International in Los
Angeles, said his organization is redirecting a cargo shipment of
8,000 blankets, more than 500 tents and 14,000 pounds of medicine and
food rations to the region. The shipment is due to arrive in Kabul
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Several aid organizations said the biggest need is for money,
which can be used to transport items and purchase goods in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Donations may be mailed to Relief International, 11965 Venice
Blvd., Suite 405, Los Angeles, CA 90066 or International Medical
Corps at 11500 W. Olympic Blvd, Suite 506, Los Angeles, CA 90064, or

<LD>Police analyzed a videotape Wednesday showing a fatal confrontation
in which officers fired 39 shots at a mentally ill man.</LD>
<LD>   The video of Friday's shooting of Alejandro Jimenez, 24, of El
Cajon was captured by two Swiss tourists who had followed police to
an outdoor shopping plaza northeast of downtown San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   The pair gave the video and still photographs to authorities, said
Lt. Mike Hurley of the San Diego Police Department, who is leading an
internal probe of the shooting.</LD>
<TE>   Seven officers fired at Jimenez. It was not yet known how many
shots hit him, Hurley said. Jimenez's family is protesting the
shooting.</TE>

sexual assault of a 50-year-old woman who was grabbed Tuesday night
while waiting at a bus stop after leaving a church; she was raped in
a vacant lot off PCH. The search lasted about five hours before Taffy
lost the scent. Prosecutors have filed charges against the restaurant
worker, including counts of rape and sodomy.</CP>

<HD>Anaheim Fire Chief May Leave</HD>
<DH>Cities: Jeff Bowman is picked to head San Diego's
department, pending City Council approval next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman was selected Wednesday to take the
helm of the city fire department in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Bowman, 49, emerged as the finalist in a national search to
replace Robert Osby, who retired Tuesday. There were 40 candidates
for the post.</LD>
<LD>   Bowman's selection must be confirmed by the San Diego City
Council, which meets Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The Anaheim fire chief is credited with developing a regional
communications program for seven Orange County cities and a joint
powers agreement to handle all of the county's hazardous-material
calls.</TE>
<TE>   He has been on the board of directors for the California Fire
Chiefs Assn. and served as the group's president from 1996 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He began his career with Anaheim in 1973 and became the city's
fire chief 13 years later.</TE>
<TE>   He earns $150,000 a year, roughly what he would make in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, who lives in Anaheim with his wife, Denise, declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed by the council, he will take over as San Diego's fire
chief May 6 and be in charge of 1,200 employees--four times the
number of Anaheim's force.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Braces for a Cultural Convergence</HD>
<DH>Holidays: Big crowds are expected at Mason Park because
Easter and the Persian New Year, which could attract 35,000
picnickers, fall on the same day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Persian New Year falls on the same day as Easter this year,
raising the possibility of diverse cultures competing for space in an
Irvine park.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just going to be a large number of people in a small amount
of space," Sgt. Dave Mihalik, a spokesman for the Irvine Police
Department, said of the crunch expected Sunday at William R. Mason
Regional Park.</LD>
<LD>   "The gridlock may start earlier and last longer than usual."</LD>
<TE>   For a dozen years, the 95-acre park has been the scene of what
local Iranians say is the largest New Year's gathering outside Iran,
drawing as many as 35,000 picnickers. "It's the busiest day of the
year for us," said Chuck Thornburg, supervising ranger at the park.</TE>
<TE>   For only the second time since the local custom began, the event
falls on Easter Sunday--the park's second busiest day.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that it will be a nice day," Thornburg said, alluding
to weather forecasts calling for temperatures in the low 80s. "The
park will be very crowded."</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating a jam, police said they are encouraging celebrants,
especially those observing Easter, to try some of the county's other
parks, including those in Laguna Niguel, Fountain Valley, Fullerton,
Buena Park and Brea.</TE>
<TE>   Mihalik said officials also are advising motorists to avoid
University Drive between the San Diego Freeway and MacArthur
Boulevard; Culver Drive between Campus Drive and the San Diego
Freeway; and Harvard Avenue between Culver and Michelson drives.</TE>
<TE>   Those who do venture out will pay $10 to park at Mason. Additional
space will be available at nearby churches and schools.</TE>
<TE>   New Year's celebrants will be greeted by a tantalizing feast, said
Armin Anvaripour, an Iranian American living in Irvine who has
participated in the local event since it began.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a big picnic with family and friends," he said of
the day, which is called Sezdeh-Bedar and marks the 13th day of the
Zoroastrian New Year.</TE>
<TE>   Among special foods will be barbecued kabob and chicken, and a
traditional vegetable soup called ashraeeeh.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called a day of nature," he said. "It's a day we want to get
out of the house to enjoy the outdoors."</TE>

<HD>Valley Traffic Cops Hop to It for Pedestrians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police officers trying to keep the city's crosswalks safe for
pedestrians say their job is an uphill battle. The situation has
become so bad that police officers in the San Fernando Valley
resorted to wearing bunny costumes Wednesday in a holiday-inspired
attempt to catch wayward drivers and jaywalkers.</LD>
<LD>   Withstanding the good-natured ribbing of their colleagues,
Officers Kurt Garcia and Connie Silber donned matching pink Easter
Bunny suits complete with big, floppy ears and patrolled--on
foot--one of the most dangerous intersections in Los Angeles: Woodman
Avenue and Parthenia Street in Panorama City.</LD>
<LD>   ''I have no problem doing this," said the 320-pound Garcia as he
patrolled the intersection in costume. "If drivers can't see me as a
big, large bunny crossing the street, what can they see?''</LD>
<TE>   Not much, apparently.</TE>
<TE>   ''We still had two really close calls with drivers slamming on the
brakes at the last second,'' Garcia said after his shift ended about
noon.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, traffic police have issued 1,372 citations to
motorists and jaywalkers in the Valley, where 40 pedestrians were
fatally struck by cars last year, representing a 19% increase over
2000. But despite their efforts, infractions have risen rather than
declined.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia got the idea to patrol in costume at Christmastime after
buying a Santa Claus suit for a family party. As Easter approached,
his boss, Sgt. Dale Turner of the Valley Traffic Division, assigned
Garcia to wear a bunny suit on traffic duty.</TE>
<TE>   ''We've had a problem at that location for a number of years,"
Turner said. "Last year, one of the accidents there was a fatal.''</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, Silber and a backup team on motorcycles issued 31 warnings
and 12 citations at the intersection Wednesday during a 4 1/2-hour
period, Turner said. The number was smaller than usual because more
drivers and pedestrians spotted the officers in their bunny suits,
Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   When Garcia's shift ended, he met Turner in the parking lot rather
than walk into the station where his colleagues could see him. ''He
avoided the building like the plague,'' Turner said.</TE>

<HD>Greuel's Push Helped Forge Districting Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Days before joining City Council, she
successfully lobbied for proposed boundaries of her constituency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A week before she takes office, Los Angeles Councilwoman-elect Wendy
Greuel has already won a legislative victory, successfully lobbying
members of the city's Redistricting Commission to revise her 2nd
Council District boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   As the City Council begins its hearings on the proposed
redistricting plan today at City Hall, winners and losers in the
commission process were preparing for the next battle.</LD>
<LD>   The plan recommended Tuesday by the commission would increase from
four to five the number of council seats wholly in the San Fernando
Valley and provide the same increase to the number of districts where
Latino voters have a plurality.</LD>
<TE>   The recommendation also addressed concerns by Greuel that the 2nd
District, as initially proposed, would have become a long, narrow,
odd-shaped district that included the disparate communities of
Sunland-Tujunga in the East Valley and Encino in the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   After lobbying from Greuel, who won election March 5, the
commission recommended a revised plan Tuesday that would provide a
more compact 2nd District. That plan swaps Studio City for Encino and
keeps the district east of the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps communities of interest together," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his appointee to the commission, Councilman Jack Weiss
opposed the change to Greuel's district, in part because it would
create uneven boundaries for his adjacent 5th District and would
split communities of interest, including Sherman Oaks and Valley
Village.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, council President Alex Padilla appointed Weiss to
head the council committee that will deliberate on the recommended
plan. Padilla also appointed council members Nick Pacheco, Eric
Garcetti, Jan Perry and Dennis Zine to the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss declined Wednesday to comment on the 2nd District plan and
promised an open and fair process to consider all proposals
recommended by the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of my new position as chairman of the council committee,
I do not think it is appropriate to speak to any boundary disputes,"
Weiss said. "I'm going to bend over backward to be fair to each and
every member of the City Council."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she is prepared to pursue her goals as the council
considers the redistricting plan, which begins at 11 a.m. when the
council's five-member Redistricting Committee hears a briefing on the
commission proposal at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The Redistricting Commission also recommended that Councilwoman
Cindy Miscikowski represent a new coastal 11th District, which would
include Venice and Westchester, that had also been sought by
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, Galanter would represent the 6th District, the new
Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   Several coastal leaders opposed Miscikowski, in part because they
said she may face a conflict of interest stemming from the leaseholds
of her husband, developer Doug Ring, in Marina del Rey just outside
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "She has already had to recuse herself from acting on the Playa
Vista project," said Venice community activist Kelley Willis, an
organizer of the area's neighborhood council.</TE>
<TE>   Willis said he and others fear Miscikowski would be unable to
aggressively advocate for issues involving Playa Vista and projects
adjacent to Marina del Rey, and may not be able to act on issues
involving expansion of Los Angeles International Airport because the
planes fly over her husband's buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski said Wednesday she has abstained from voting on Playa
Vista issues out of an "abundance of caution," but said she has since
received a city attorney's legal opinion stating that she does not
have a conflict voting on issues such as Playa Vista because they are
more than 500 feet from properties in which her husband has an
interest.</TE>

<DH>Miranda: Lawyers for boy accused in homeless man's slaying
seek to suppress statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Ventura boy accused of taking part in the beachside
slaying of a homeless man last summer appeared in court Wednesday, as
defense lawyers sought to suppress his statements to police.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Mattley is charged with murder in the fatal beating of
58-year-old James Clark, who died of severe internal injuries and a
possible fractured skull.</LD>
<LD>   Those wounds were allegedly inflicted by four teenagers who police
say robbed Clark and then kicked, beat and threw rocks at him as he
lay in a sleeping bag near the mouth of the Ventura River on June 30.</LD>
<TE>   Police arrested Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View; Timothy Becker,
18, of Ventura; Christopher Dunham, 19, of Ventura; and Mattley, and
got conflicting statements from them.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors later charged all four with murder but
elected to prosecute Mattley in Juvenile Court because he was 14 at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley's trial before a Juvenile Court judge began earlier this
month with testimony from the medical examiner and continued
Wednesday as defense lawyers pushed to throw out his statements to
police.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether the boy understood what he was doing when he
waived his Miranda rights and consented to the July 9 interview after
his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Judy and Matthew Mattley testified that police picked up their son
in front of an apartment complex on Cedar Street in west Ventura and
held him for five hours at the station. Despite their numerous
frantic calls to police, they said, they were not allowed to speak to
their son or be present during the interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Mattley testified that he called the detective division
half a dozen times that night and was told only that his boy was
being "detained."</TE>
<TE>   "If they were questioning him about any of this, I felt we had a
right to be there," the father said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sgt. Jerry Thurston, who supervises the detective division,
testified that police don't need parental consent to interview a
juvenile suspect. He also said neither of Mattley's parents demanded
to be present at the interview or came to the station that night.</TE>
<TE>   Under further questioning by Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher,
however, Thurston acknowledged that the parents sounded worried on
the phone and clearly wanted to see their son.</TE>
<TE>   As Thurston dealt with the parents that night, Mattley waived his
rights to an attorney and implicated himself in the fatal beating,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Thomas Radman said the boy didn't seem confused or unaware of
his rights, and he never asked for his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The trial and hearing on the Miranda issue are expected to
continue today before Superior Court Judge John Dobroth. The case is
expected to wrap up Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If Dobroth finds that Mattley played a role in the killing, the
boy could be held in a juvenile detention facility until his 25th
birthday. The other three suspects are scheduled to stand trial April
26. They face possible life prison sentences if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Aspiring Oxnard Football Player Fatally Stabbed During
Argument Over Woman</HD>
<DH>Violence: A suspect turns himself in and is being held in
county jail pending arraignment.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 25-year-old Oxnard man who played semipro football and dreamed of
making it to the NFL was stabbed to death during a fight with another
man over the victim's girlfriend, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Artis Charvelle Jackson was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional
Medical Center in Oxnard just after 8 p.m. Tuesday from multiple stab
wounds to the neck and back, said James Baroni, a senior deputy
medical examiner for Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hosea, who moved from Louisiana to Oxnard about eight
months ago, turned himself in to Oxnard police four hours after the
stabbing and was booked on suspicion of murder, Sgt. Jim Seitz said.</LD>
<TE>   "He knew we wanted to talk to him, so he came in," Seitz said of
Hosea, who was dropped off at the Oxnard Police Department just after
midnight by a friend. "These guys knew each other, and the incident
was personal between them."</TE>
<TE>   Seitz would not say whether Hosea confessed to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Hosea was being held Wednesday at Ventura County Jail in lieu of
$500,000 bail. His arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court is
scheduled Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Argument Precedes the Stabbing</TE>
<TE>   Jackson was stabbed after a brief argument with Hosea in the
parking lot of the Vineyard Avenue apartment unit the slain man
shared with his girlfriend, their 7-year-old son and other relatives,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson worked in customer service for a credit card company in
the San Fernando Valley, said his half-brother, Mario Robertson, 19.
But his dream, which he pursued through daily weight-training
sessions in his apartment, was to play for his favorite NFL team, the
Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   "That would have been the ultimate," Robertson said Wednesday. "He
still wanted to make it in football and I believed in him, and even
if I didn't, he had it in his mind that he was going to do it. Now
I'm in shock. My nephew has no father."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his death, Jackson was making plans to try out for
several Arena Football League teams, Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson played football for Hueneme High before moving on to
Ventura College, said Jim Lane, the high school's athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just dumbfounded," Lane said. "Here is another young person
getting killed, and you start wondering and try to make some sort of
sense of it."</TE>
<TE>   Others at the school said that although he had moved on, Jackson
would return occasionally to visit and show off pictures of his son.</TE>
<TE>   He also played football briefly for Moorpark College and for
Chapman University in Orange, Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, he had played for the California Bandits, a
Pasadena-based semipro football team.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Wednesday, Robertson took calls from friends, relatives
and Oxnard investigators still trying to piece together the events
that led up to the stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   On the small kitchen table in the family apartment were
photographs of Jackson, his girlfriend, Demetrice Folse, and his son.</TE>
<TE>   By midday Wednesday, Seitz said, investigators had interviewed
about 20 witnesses and were waiting to talk to several others.</TE>
<TE>   Suspect Recently Met Victim's Girlfriend</TE>
<TE>   Hosea had met Folse recently when she baby-sat for his sister in
Ventura, Robertson said, and Jackson and Hosea had also argued about
her before Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The latest argument was brief, loud and violent, according to
Robertson and others who said they witnessed it.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson said Hosea parked his car in the rear of the complex and
soon was confronted by Jackson. The two fought briefly before Hosea
walked to his pickup truck and drove off, Robertson said. Jackson
struggled to his feet and tried to walk, told his half-brother he had
been stabbed and then collapsed, Robertson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was walking with my brother, telling him to hold on," Robertson
said. "His eyes were open, but he wasn't saying anything."</TE>
<TE>   The homicide was the second in Oxnard in four days. On Saturday, a
61-year-old mentally disabled man died after being shot and his home
firebombed. No arrests have been made in that case.</TE>
