also is a nice table decoration, it's that good-looking. The sleek,
translucent container has a removable lid along with a removable soft

<DH>Portuguese-style bullfights stress courage of the human
adversaries, not harm to the animal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NOA JONES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before 1,500 gasping and cheering spectators, Leonardo Benitez taunts
a very angry 1,000-pound bull with his hot-pink cape. Sequins sparkle
in the afternoon blaze. The bull digs its hoofs into the dirt, snorts
and charges. In a swift motion, the Venezuelan matador flicks his
wrist and thrusts his torso outward in utter confidence as the
animal's sharp horns pass scant centimeters from his thigh. It skids
to a stop, frothing, momentarily confused, then whips its head around
for another pass.</LD>
<LD>   It's a scene one would expect in Madrid, even Tijuana, but this is
suburban Los Angeles County. And this bullfight, in the Portuguese
tradition, is bloodless, at least on the bull's part. The spears
common in traditional fights are here replaced with sticks fashioned
with Velcro points. The bull wears a matching Velcro patch around its
collar. But the danger for the matador still exists, and the audience
is duly captivated.</LD>
<LD>   This corrida, or bullfight, closed out the 75th annual Divine Holy
Spirit Celebration last week of Artesia's Divino Espirito Santo, a
Portuguese cultural center. Benitez and Lisbon matador Jose Luis
Goncalves, and cavaleiro (a bullfighter on horseback) Joseph Correia
of Madera, each faced two bulls over the course of the evening with
much pomp and pageantry in between.</LD>
<TE>   During the festival, a small mob of boys climbs the scaffolding
under the bleachers to peer into a cramped trailer where the bulls
are angrily knocking about. "I've been coming here since I was born,"
says Ricardo Consuelo. He and his friend, Miles LaFaye, both 11, hope
to get into the ring themselves one day. "I want to ride horseback."</TE>
<TE>   Correia and his white stallion, Draco, are stunning as they parade
into the arena. Horse and man bow to the crowd. Correia hands his
feathered hat to his father, Manuel Correia, who breeds bulls and
Andalusian bullfighting horses. He grabs the hat and ducks into a
slot in the arena wall big enough for a man but not a raging bull.
The younger Correia and Draco proceed to gracefully skirt the bull's
mad dashes until six tinsel-festooned spears are Velcroed to the
bull, further fanning its fury.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the group of local forcados or "grabbers" who steal the
show. The 12-member Southern California Forcados has one of the most
daunting roles of the entire corrida--wrestling the bull down by
hand. It is a maneuver that has one member charge headlong at the
bull with the others in quick pursuit. The first forcado goes for the
horns; the others pile on where they can for a result that looks
something like a rugby scrum over the bull. Though less elegant than
the matadors, the forcados require skill and much courage.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, a forcado is lying in the dirt while the others
scramble up the sidewalls of the arena lifting their stockinged legs
just inches above the bull's reach. The animal turns and charges low,
tossing the fallen man to the side. The audience cranes to see what
the damage might be. Two banderilleros, the matador's assistants,
unfurl their capes and shout to distract the bull long enough for the
forcado to scramble out of harm's way. He's up. He seems to be
walking straight. The forcados prepare to charge.</TE>
<TE>   Each has a hat tucked under his arm, a sort of long ski cap.
Whoever wears his hat takes it upon himself to rush the bull first.
Donovan Hendrik, the "golden boy" of the team (perhaps the only
natural blond in the entire arena) faces the bull, dons his hat and
rushes straight for the horns. His teammates pile up after him,
wresting the bull to a stop. Testosterone versus taurine. Once the
bull is subdued, they let him go and run back to safety. It's a
riveting enough display to wrench folks away from the saloon.</TE>
<TE>   The forcados practice every Sunday for three hours, ramming a
55-gallon barrel on a wheeled teeter-totter at each other. Each
forcado wears black knee pants, a tailored jacket, necktie and three
yards of brilliant red fabric, which is wrapped around his waist.</TE>
<TE>   Joey DeMelo is on the injured list. He lifts up his pant leg to
prove that the danger in the ring is real. "I've got a metal plate
and six screws in my leg," he says. He also has a 9-inch scar from
the 25 staples doctors used to put his leg back together.</TE>
<TE>   "Most guys come [to be a forcado] for the adrenaline rush," he
says. "But they start getting into it for the tradition and the
history."</TE>
<TE>   After seven years of training, DeMelo met his match in a ring last
year. The bull lifted him off the ground and threw him so hard his
leg snapped, the bone piercing his skin. It was the first broken bone
for the Southern California Forcados in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you feel bad for the bull that hit you?" jokes an elderly
man passing by. "He probably has a headache."</TE>
<TE>   "He's still alive, they kept him as their star stud."</TE>
<TE>   "You were lucky," the man says with a serious nod.</TE>
<TE>   "I know. It could've been a lot worse."</TE>
<TE>   The bullfight is a major social occasion for those in the
Portuguese community, many of whom hail from Portugal's volcanic
Terceira island in the Azores. Children run wild on soda pop binges,
teenage girls get dressed up, old men hang out by one of the two
D.E.S. saloons munching on bifanas--pork sandwiches.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodless bullfights have been part of the festival since the
1970s. This being a special 75th anniversary, all past festival
queens were invited back for the parade. Ninetysomething Mary
Ferreira, the very first queen, returned as grand marshal. Eighteen
other Portuguese organizations from throughout California's dairy
belt, from Tulare to the Mexican border, participated. Highlights of
the festival include the parade, a beef soup meal, ceremonial Mass,
crowning of the queen and an auction. "It has an element of the
profane and the religious," says John Garcia, secretary of the D.E.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Mass is an important factor. Bullfighting without religion is
a misdemeanor offense, according to California Penal Code 597M
enacted in 1957. Fights are permissible only if associated with a
religious activity. Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles, laments this
loophole. "It's beyond me how religious institutions could condone
tormenting an animal as somehow connected to a religious practice,"
she says. "It sets a bad example for children; they imitate it and
start throwing things at their pets. It's not OK."</TE>
<TE>   Though the bulls are not gored, there is a little blood. Draco the
horse bleeds slightly from Correia's powerful spurring. It's not a
gentle sport. It is designed to bring out the worst in what is
otherwise a peaceful beast. The odd pairing of two barnyard animals
that normally would pay no mind to one another is all part of the
spectacle of bullfighting.</TE>
<TE>   Though the bulls are not harmed, they will most likely be sent to
slaughter after the corrida. "They can only be used once or they
learn too much," says breeder Manuel Correia. There are 18
bull-breeding farms in California. The bulls are sold for such
occasions for about $2,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   As the corrida winds down, the band strikes up a classic
pasodoble-- traditional Spanish bullfighting music with blazing
horns. All the bullfighters parade the arena, taking in a round of
applause and drinking from the leather pouches of red wine that are
tossed from the stands.</TE>

<LD>Brittany is only 15, but the Ventura High School ninth-grader acts as
head of the household. She takes the bus to buy groceries, makes sure
the bills are paid, budgets for each month, and gets prescriptions
filled for her 79-year-old grandmother, Mary, and her father,
Rudolph, who became unemployed last year when he developed severe
heart problems.</LD>
<LD>   "They don't know what it is yet," said Brittany. "And my grandma
has diabetes, heart trouble, back pain, everything. She had double
pneumonia a couple months ago and we had to call an ambulance because
we don't have a car."</LD>
<LD>   "It has been hard for her to watch her loved ones go through the
pain without being able to stop it," said Robert Gambala, the gang
violence suppression coordinator at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Ventura,
where Brittany, an only child, spends most of her time outside of
home and school. She becomes frustrated that her father can no longer
do the things he used to, said Gambala. "At times, she has expressed
that things are overwhelming, and we talk it out."</LD>
<TE>   Brittany's mother left when she was an infant. "Sometimes I hear
from her, but my grandmother is my mother, as far as I'm concerned,"
said Brittany. Her family has been struggling financially, but she
hasn't tried to get a job because she thinks it would hurt her
father's pride. Instead, she says, she mows lawns when she needs
extra money.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are tight. Brittany knows she can't get everything she
wants. She's not going to get a new pair of shoes--the family makes
sure she is clothed, but the luxuries of a teenager, well, Brittany
understands they're not a reality for her," said Gambala.</TE>
<TE>   Even though she has been selected to go to YMCA Camp Big Bear with
the support of The Times summer camp campaign, Brittany is unsure
whether she will be able to attend because her father will need her
help during his upcoming angiogram and possible angioplasty. "I'll
have to stay home from summer school a couple of days--it kind of
clashes with other things I want to do," she admits. Then she adds
quickly, "but they are my No. 1 priority. It is all right."</TE>
<TE>   Gambala is trying to find a camp session that will not interfere
with her family's needs, "because she deserves something like this,
to get away and be a kid. These are critical years to her. She can't
take them back."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer, thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call
(213) 237-5771. To make credit card donations, visit
www.latimes.com/summercamp. Do not send cash.</TE>
<TE>   All donations are tax-deductible. Unless donors request otherwise,
gifts of $25 or more are acknowledged in The Times. The summer camp
campaign is part of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the
McCormick Tribune Foundation.</TE>

<LD>Postcards from a family car trip:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Grandma,</LD>
<LD>   How are you? I am fine. We're on our way up to this really neat
lake for our summer vacation.</LD>
<TE>   I am in our minivan next to my brother. He smells like a brother.
Have you ever had a brother? Did he smell? I can hear his brain
through his headphones.</TE>
<TE>   Did I tell you that we brought the dog? He's on my lap and licking
my knee over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Mom gave him some special pills so he wouldn't breathe too much
and get all slobbery. Mom says if you don't give a dog some
medication, he might get car sick. I think this is going to be a real
fun trip.</TE>
<TE>   My dad's paying me a buck to write you this postcard. I hope you
liked it. Was it worth a buck?</TE>
<TE>   (The little girl)</TE>
<TE>   Dear Grandma,</TE>
<TE>   This is your grandson from California writing you. Dad's paying us
to write you, but I would anyway. I hope you'll remember that around
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   We just stopped at this AM/PM for lunch. You can get a lot of
great food at an AM/PM, hot dogs and stuff. My mom wanted to know why
we couldn't stop at a real, actual restaurant, and my dad said this
is a real restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "I read about this in the Michelin Guide," he told her. "We're
lucky to get in."</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be really fun, this car trip. We're going to this
lake called Nacimiento. Dad says it's a Spanish word meaning "50%
mark-up."</TE>
<TE>   When we get to the lake, we're going to rent a boat, and I'm going
to wake board. There's also a county fair up there. Dad says if we're
really good, he'll take us to a monster truck rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, that would be like a dream come true for me," my big sister
told him.</TE>
<TE>   This might be our best vacation ever.</TE>
<TE>   (The boy)</TE>
<TE>   Dear Grandma,</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe they're making me go on this trip with them.
First, Mom gets pregnant and now this? I'm in college now, and they
still make me go on these trips.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, let's bring the dog this time," my dad says, and my mom
says, "Sure, that'd be fun." Like we don't have enough drool in our
car already.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we stopped at this horrible place for lunch. It was a gas
station where they served hot dogs. That's where he took us to eat,
to a gas station.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll leave us more money for boat rentals," he said. "Besides,
they have really good food."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Dad, remember I'm a vegetarian now," I reminded him.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get you a nice hot dog bun," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not lunch," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we'll get you two then," he says, handing me a dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Oh my God. I can so not wait for school to start again.</TE>
<TE>   Grandma, is there any way you could have me rescued? Seriously,
send in those Army Rangers or something? I would, like, pay you?</TE>
<TE>   Dad says we are going to this great little lake that's sort of
remote. Isn't that how every bad movie starts? I'll bet there's a new
strain of encephalitis just waiting to be discovered. Or a chipmunk
with rabies living in the kitchen cupboard. "Hey look, kids, a
chipmunk," my dad will say, and the next thing you know we'll all be
totally dead. I swear, that's how things go with us.</TE>
<TE>   Hope you are fine. I also hope you never have to go on a car trip
like this one. Seriously.</TE>
<TE>   (Lovely and impatient older daughter)</TE>
<TE>   Dear Mom,</TE>
<TE>   Just a quick note from the edge of paradise. We're taking the kids
up the interstate to this lake north of Los Angeles. It's about a
day's drive. You wouldn't believe how excited they all are.</TE>
<TE>   For lunch, I took them to this little spot off the Golden State
Freeway. It wasn't fancy, but it was the first meal we've had
together all summer. The kids really seemed to like it.</TE>
<TE>   Our friends Bob and Lynda have a place up there. I don't know
exactly where we are going. The map's a little fuzzy. I hope we make
it up there before dark. You know how Dad used to read AAA maps and
swear about the tiny type? That's me now.</TE>
<TE>   I remember those car trips we took with Dad up to Wisconsin 30
years ago. Those were the best.</TE>
<TE>   I'll bet the kids remember this forever.</TE>
<TE>   (Dad)</TE>
<TE>   Dear Grandma,</TE>
<TE>   We are so lost. Seriously. Lost.</TE>
<TE>   I'm writing this note on my brother's arm in case they don't find
us in time. Maybe this way people can piece together what happened.</TE>
<TE>   I think we stopped for gas and Dad took a wrong turn. Far as I can
tell, we're on this logging trail somewhere in the Sierras. Either
that or western Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The dog is sick, and my little sister is crying. About an hour
ago, Mom and Dad quit speaking to each other. Forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's right up here," my dad says as my mom rolls her
eyes. You should see how red his neck is getting. The dog is on his
lap, helping him drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, give him a sedative or something," I told her, but I think
she already ate all the doggy sedatives herself.</TE>
<TE>   According to Dad, there's nothing to worry about. He says he's
been on dates worse than this. I don't know if he means with Mom or
someone else.</TE>
<TE>   My dad says he will stop to ask for directions as soon as he sees
someone "without apparent chromosome damage." Lots of luck, I say.</TE>
<TE>   Oh my God, I think we're back in the same place we were an hour
ago. Dad seems to be driving in giant circles. Oh my God.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's right up here," he keeps muttering.</TE>
<TE>   Ground Control to Major Tom. Ground control to Major Tom. Major
Tom, please turn that minivan around right now.</TE>
<TE>   Help!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I recently got street parking in the middle of a workday on La
Cienega Boulevard between Clifton and Wilshire, and it so unnerved me
that I spent a full five minutes walking up and down the sidewalk
trying to figure out what was wrong. Gray curb, no permit-demanding
sign, no fire hydrant in evidence, no huge Ace safe or grand piano
dangling from the window above.</LD>
<LD>   Still, in the land of "only $5 every five mins." parking garages,
I was so convinced that there was a catch I almost moved the car just
because and I spent the next hour of my doctor's appointment waiting
to see how much the inevitable ticket would be.</LD>
<LD>   This is what comes from 12 years of battling the demons and
apparitions of street parking in L.A..</LD>
<TE>   How many years have been sucked from my life by the sudden mirage
of curbside emptiness that shimmers just a half a block away even as
the minutes until that big interview or dreamboat lunch date tick by.
Elation swooshes through your veins as you make your move, only to
find the sulking lip of a driveway, or the mocking red slash of a
no-parking zone.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst, the absolute worst, is when the space is real.
Miraculously, you manage a perfect three-motion parallel landing,
rake through the glove box and front seat for the 97 quarters
necessary to buy the time to get your hair cut and purchase a
magazine, only to find that the parking meter is broken.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you discover this before you put in your money--a slug
is jammed in it, or a kind soul has scrawled "broken" on a shred of
an Old Navy bag and stuck it in the slot. But more often you don't
realize until, in your haste, you've dumped in the price of a pack of
cigarettes. Why is the needle not moving? Why is that irritating
digital face still blinking a blank-eyed 0:00?</TE>
<TE>   Because the meter is broken, that's why.</TE>
<TE>   After it's happened, oh, seven or eight times in as many days,
it's hard not to take it personally. One woman said it's gotten so
bad that she's been peering around for the "Candid Camera" crew,
cocking her head to hear the telltale "Twilight Zone" intro. But
according to City Controller Laura Chick, it really isn't you, it's
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the first survey of parking meters discovered that
10% of the city's meters are inoperable. Chick dutifully advised that
the city fix them because increasing the "operable meter inventory"
by just 5% would generate a cool million in revenue that Chick, for
one, is certain the city would put to very good use. Like providing
therapy for people like me who have developed serious parking-trust
issues over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Broken meters are often behind empty parking spaces because so
many of us have no idea what to do when the meter is broken. Should
we tape a buck's worth of quarters to the windshield with a note?
Thank our lucky stars and consider moving to an apartment nearby and
never moving our car again?</TE>
<TE>   In communities like Santa Monica, where you can be ticketed for
not depositing money in the meter even if there is still plenty of
time on it, it's hard to imagine you will be allowed to park for free
just because the thing is broken.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, according to the office of parking management, that is,
in fact, the case. You will not be ticketed for parking at a broken
meter, but you should report the fact that the meter is damaged by
calling the 800 number on the meter.</TE>
<TE>   Which will take just a little more time than it would have to find
the necessary parking change, but, hey, at least for once, the
meter's not running.</TE>

<LD>After you brush your teeth, wash dishes, take a bath or flush your
toilet, do you know where the water goes after it empties down your
drain?</LD>
<LD>   The water goes to places like the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant
in Van Nuys. It comes to the plant in underground pipes. The water
then goes through a series of steps to clean it. This takes about 11
hours. Then, the reclaimed water is used in such places as lakes,
golf courses, parks, freeway landscaping--and for the Japanese
Garden.</LD>
<LD>   A breathtaking sight, the Japanese Garden is actually three
gardens in one. There is a Zen meditation garden, a tea garden and a
"wet-strolling" garden. The wet-strolling garden has waterfalls,
lakes, and streams that support wildlife such as fish and birds.</LD>
<TE>   During times of water shortage, the Tillman Water Reclamation
Plant has also provided water for Lake Balboa and the wildlife lake
in the Sepulveda Basin.</TE>
<TE>   So remember, when you flush your toilet, take a bath or brush your
teeth, the water you use may be cleaned, treated and reused in lakes
or to water the greenery at the Japanese Garden. What a perfect way
to recycle and add beauty to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about water reclamation and its beneficial reuses by
attending docent-led tours or visiting the Japanese Garden. For
information, call (818) 756-8166 or visit thejapanesegarden.com.</TE>

<HD>A Worldview, Direct From Rural Indiana</HD>
<DH>Haven Kimmel's novel recalls her past in exploring love and
longing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, there is her name: Haven. Fixing you with her big green eyes,
Haven Kimmel explains, "I actually changed my name when I was 18. I
asked to change it when I was 6."</LD>
<LD>   Her given name, she says, couldn't have been worse had it been
Brunhilde. "It was one of those diminutives that are so awful in an
older woman. It didn't fit me at all." One of those monikers,
perhaps, like Bambi, with which a future generation of nursing home
residents is doomed to be saddled? Kimmel just smiles. "I never
tell."</LD>
<LD>   As for Haven, "There was a folk singer in Kentucky named Haven
Hughes. I heard it and said, 'That's it.' "</LD>
<TE>   But it was as Zippy--a name her father gave his child in perpetual
motion after a roller-skating chimp on TV--that Kimmel made a splash
last year in the book world with "A Girl Named Zippy," her memoir
about growing up in Mooreland, Ind. (population 300). Written in her
childhood voice, it is a laugh-out-loud peek into the lives of those
who dwelt there in the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Mooreland, Kimmel tells us, was a lily-white town with three
churches but no taverns, "bordered at the north end by a cemetery and
at the south by a funeral home." Women had such names as Loverline
and Deltrice, metallic Christmas trees were big, and vacation meant
either visiting relatives in Tennessee or going camping. "Once I saw
two people honeymooning in a pup tent smack in the middle of the
bride's parents' yard."</TE>
<TE>   Now 37 and two decades removed from Mooreland, Kimmel lives and
writes in Durham, N.C., and recently published her first novel, "The
Solace of Leaving Early." Set in a fictional small Indiana town,
Haddington, it centers on two people whose mutual antipathy evolves
into love and marriage after two orphaned girls come into their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   It is reflective and thought-provoking and, in places, very funny.
Consider that the female protagonist, Langston Braverman, has a dog
named Germane (not as in Greer, but "as in germane to this
conversation"), whose civility, she is convinced, resulted from his
early and repeated exposure to Emily Dickinson.</TE>
<TE>   Haddington, Kimmel tells us, has neither a library nor a bookstore
but does boast Kountry Kids and Kousins, "where one could acquire a
wide variety of stuffed rabbits in gingham dresses and wooden little
black children for one's front yard."</TE>
<TE>   And when Braverman, a dropout from a university English doctoral
program, returns to Haddington, it is to her parents' home, a house
clad in avocado-colored aluminum siding, with brown shutters, "thus
causing it to look, from a distance, like a salad going bad."</TE>
<TE>   In its first draft--500 pages that she tossed out--"Solace" was an
academic comedy told by Braverman, the tale of "someone persistently
battling the lowering of her standards by the philistines of her
hometown. It was a funny book, but it was not the book I should have
been writing."</TE>
<TE>   So, having a two-book contract from Doubleday, which specified a
novel as the second, Kimmel plunged in again, "operating on faith and
panic." She was determined to write a book that addresses "those
really poignant questions about life and death and family," feeling
that a book that "doesn't reflect the most important or beautiful or
hilarious aspects of human life isn't worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   At 257 pages, "Solace" tackles those questions. In it, there is a
double murder that orphans two little girls, who take to calling
themselves Immaculata and Epiphany, and see visions of the Virgin
Mary in their backyard. There is an old love affair with a former
professor that has left Braverman with a broken heart and a damaged
psyche. There are the feelings of guilt and failure that keep
preacher Amos Townsend awake nights. And, ultimately, there is a love
that unites Braverman and Townsend.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles recently, Kimmel talked about life in Mooreland and
life in Durham, where she lives in a 1930s house with daughter Katie
Romerill, 17, and son Obadiah Kimmel, almost 6, by second husband Ben
Kimmel, from whom she is separated. She talked of literature and, oh
yes, litigation.</TE>
<TE>   It seems not all of the denizens of Mooreland were thrilled with
her depiction of them in "Zippy." While her elderly neighbor, Edythe,
who wore the same dress 23 days in a row and "clacked her false teeth
together like a castanet," had gone to her reward, Kimmel's
third-grade teacher had not--and her granddaughters were hopping mad
over Kimmel's description of her as both an incompetent and "the
meanest woman in the history of the Mooreland Elementary School."</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel decided to take the offensive, collecting depositions from
50 other former third-graders, all corroborating her description. She
faxed them to Doubleday, which forwarded the best to the litigious
granddaughters, who promptly dropped their defamation suit.</TE>
<TE>   But most of Kimmel's memories of small-town America are
affectionate. "Looking back," she says, "it was almost all pluses."
She mentions the "radical freedom, the unstructured time" that were
her childhood gifts. "My parents didn't have any interest in making
me take lessons in anything." Mothers sewed, canned vegetables and
went to church three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   She thinks "Zippy," recently out in paperback, resonated with
readers because "there was no incest, nothing profound or dramatic or
traumatic, just a little kid living her life in a perfectly normal
place surrounded by eccentrics. In the memoir genre, there is a great
deal of examining and self-indulgent suffering or victimization, and
not everybody wants to read that."</TE>
<TE>   Her childhood was normal? Kimmel smiles. "I think I choose to see
it that way." But by her own description, her home was "pandemonium,"
a place where her hamster Skippy drowned in her potty chair. Little
Zippy never uttered a syllable until, when she was almost 3, her
father tried to terminate her bottle. As recorded by her mother in
her baby book, Zippy looked him square in the eye and told him: "I'll
make a deal with you." The deal--to hide the bottle when company
came--was a no-go, but Zippy the wordsmith was born.</TE>
<TE>   The Jarvis family--Zippy, older sister Melinda, older brother
Daniel and parents Bob and Delonda--were the stuff of TV sitcoms. Bob
had a fondness for gambling and worked at something, although "none
of us ever knew what," Kimmel says. Her mother "was really a person
living in her mind, and on the corner of the couch [reading science
fiction], like she'd been in hibernation her whole life."</TE>
<TE>   Life changed for her mother when the women in her Quaker prayer
cell encouraged her to take a TV-advertised college aptitude test.
She did, and went on to earn undergraduate and master's degrees at
Ball State University in Muncie, teach high school and college and
become a motivational speaker. She now teaches Shakespeare to
maximum-security prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, all this upset the balance of the 27-year marriage,
and when Kimmel was 12, her parents divorced. By 18, Kimmel was
living on her own, waitressing in a diner and enrolled at Ball State.
But she became pregnant by an Air Force man, married him, moved to
Biloxi, Miss., and stayed home for two years with their daughter. "As
everyone knows, that presents two options. One is to kill yourself.
The other is to set your hair on fire." She found a third--to write.</TE>
<TE>   After her brief marriage ended, she returned to Ball State to get
a degree in English and creative writing. A poet, she was "on a clear
trajectory" toward a master of fine arts degree--until she looked
around her and realized that most MFA candidates were "writers who
wrote about writing and wrote about people writing about writing or
writing about how they were not writing about writing about writing"
or else were writing about "how their broken eyeglasses were a
metaphor for their broken spirits. There was this incestuous circling
around a very few subjects, and not the subjects poets should be
dealing with."</TE>
<TE>   She began reflecting on a book she liked, Gail Godwin's 1991
novel, "Father Melancholy's Daughter," the story of a young girl who
becomes friend and caretaker to her rector father after they are
abandoned by her mother. "I knew right then if you want to be a
writer, you better be confronting the largest questions--evil,
suffering, mortality, beauty."</TE>
<TE>   She called Earlham School of Religion, a Quaker seminary in
Richmond, Ind., and said, "Look, I'm an atheist. In addition, I'm a
sinner who falls from the grace of God every single day. Can I come
to your seminary anyway?" They said yes. She stayed three years,
studying religious philosophy and theology, but she never bothered to
get her degree. "I learned what I needed to know."</TE>
<TE>   What she learned: "A great deal of humility." She remains a
nonbeliever, but a much more tolerant one: "When someone says, 'God,'
I can't assume I know what they mean." She sees religion as the
perfect metaphor for a writer, "trying to see the world from all
angles and at the same time see the unseen world."</TE>
<TE>   "Solace" is the first book in a planned trilogy. She has completed
the second, "Rattlesnake Kite," to be published by Doubleday, and is
working on the third. All three will be set in rural Indiana, but the
only repeating character is a funeral director, "the one person," she
explains, "that everyone knows in rural Indiana."</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel is prolific. Due out next summer from a division of
Houghton Mifflin is a children's book, "Orville," about a stray dog.
She insists she writes like fury because she is otherwise totally
unemployable. She has yet to suffer the agony of multiple
rejections--two weeks after her first choice, a North Carolina
publisher, rejected "Zippy" as not commercial, Doubleday snapped it
up.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel's tastes in contemporary literature are nothing if not
eclectic. She likes Ray Bradbury--whose works she used to copy as a
9-year-old and claim as her own--and John Updike, and also John
Crowley, the fantasy writer whose novel "Little, Big" is her
"favorite book ever." And she loves John Kennedy Toole's 1981
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, "A Confederacy of Dunces." and its
character, Ignatius G. Reilly, who wreaks havoc wherever he goes.</TE>
<TE>   Kimmel says she owes a great debt to Anne Tyler, whose novels she
has read and reread. "The whole secret of writing is in those books.
She's very, very sly. It seems as if nothing's happening, but
everything's in them--life and death and birth. I really want to
train that sort of eye on the world."</TE>

<LD>Wolfman gave instructions as the kids canoed across the lake. Some of
the campers splashed each other with their paddles. When they reached
the dock on the other side, there was a crooked wooden sign that
read: Camp Rattlesnake.</LD>
<LD>   Two tired-looking log cabins stood side by side. Behind them were
boulders big enough to climb. Large rocks and shrubs were scattered
around.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone has five minutes of free time!" Wolfman said.</LD>
<TE>   Devin ran to the closest cabin. She was the first one to open the
door. Inside, two bunk beds were pushed against the walls. The cabin
smelled of pine needles and wet wood. A large spider web hung from
the ceiling in the corner over one of the beds. The kids that came in
behind her were claiming beds by throwing their backpacks on them.
One bed was left.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't sleep under a spider web!" Devin said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a broom behind the door," said a girl named Jane.</TE>
<TE>   Jane reached for the broom, handing it to Devin. Devin stood
there, feeling thirsty, hungry and homesick. Something on the floor
caught her eye. It was black and moving toward her. Jane saw it too.
She yelped and jumped onto the closest bed.</TE>
<TE>   Devin bent down and let the spider climb onto the bristles of the
broom. "I'm taking you outside," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside there was a lot of commotion. Jack was standing in front
of his cabin. Dangling from his fingers was the shed skin of a
rattlesnake. He was waving it back and forth, delighted by the fact
that he was making the girls scream.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoa!" said Wolfman. "Every time camp is empty our friend
Bartholomew pays a visit."</TE>

<DH>An ex-ballerina discovers a bold sense of sexuality and
power in the art of striptease</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toni Bentley's obsessions are apparent on the walls of her Hollywood
house.</LD>
<LD>   In the eggshell-colored dining room, surrounding a polished
mahogany table, hang three large posters. An Art Deco Josephine Baker
is framed next to a stripper from the famed Crazy Horse Saloon in
Paris. And the opposite wall is dominated by a ballerina, Maria
Tallchief, striking a pose from "Swan Lake."</LD>
<LD>   The Tallchief image is easy to explain: Bentley, who's in her
early 40s, took her first dance lesson when she was 4, and spent 10
years with George Balanchine's New York City Ballet. The Baker image,
she says, reflects the power of nudity.</LD>
<TE>   As for the stripper, Bentley became fascinated with striptease
when she saw her first show at the Crazy Horse--and made a connection
between stripping and ballet.</TE>
<TE>   "I experienced an astonishing moment of self-recognition," she
writes in her new book. "This glamorous, slim, athletic woman was a
Balanchine dancer without her leotard--and I was she."</TE>
<TE>   The worlds come together in, "Sisters of Salome" (Yale University
Press, 2002), her history of modern striptease told in four profiles.</TE>
<TE>   "The striptease at the Crazy Horse gave new meaning to my years
spent in tights, tutus and tiaras," Bentley writes. "Partial,
simulated, decorated, and disguised nudity is part of the appeal of a
ballerina. Ballet wear is theatrical underwear--silk, satin, velvet
and chiffon their common coverings.</TE>
<TE>   "Stilettos are toe shoes with a stabilizing training heel; both
elongate the female leg to its erotic pinnacle. What are boned tutu
bodices but skintight corsets and push-up bras? What are pink tights
but warm naked legs?"</TE>
<TE>   When a hip injury forced her retirement from the ballet company in
1986, Bentley's overriding fantasy, she said, was to transcend
symbolism and become the stripper--which she did on the stage of a
New York club called the Blue Angel.</TE>
<TE>   Her own striptease connects her to the four "Sisters of Salome":
Maud Allan, a Canadian dancer; Mata Hari, the Dutch spy; Ida
Rubenstein, a Russian diva; and Colette, the French author. Bentley's
book describes women who subverted notions about sexuality and power,
she said. The four all used their sexuality to get what they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "These women subverted the existing rules to search out a new
identity," Bentley writes in the introduction to "Sisters." "They
recognized, without moral constraint or fear, that the body is basic,
and men through the ages have shown a negotiable weakness for it,
even when they've shown little for other forms of appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Striptease is a male fantasy, she writes, but "more significant
and less comfortably acknowledged, especially by women, is that the
prospect of revealing one's nude body to a roomful of riveted voyeurs
is a common female scenario ....It is undoubtedly a male fantasy to
look--but it is also a female fantasy to show ....Stripping is both
defiant and seductive, an autoerotic metaphor for female arousal
where foreplay is central, not peripheral, and the art of the tease
is the path to pleasure." Bentley, an Australian who grew up in the
U.S., says she was possessed by the stage when she joined
Balanchine's school.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through the doors at the Lincoln Center, she said, "my
life changed forever."</TE>
<TE>   Not only was Balanchine a "genius," a "Sufi teacher," who inspired
those around him, he was also the person who introduced her to the
Crazy Horse.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dancing in Paris, and Balanchine would bring these
beautiful girls in short skirts backstage," she said. "We were
completely hypnotized. 'Who are these girls?' " As it turned out,
they were strippers from the Crazy Horse.</TE>
<TE>   Bentley was intrigued and, deciding to investigate, spent an
entire per diem, today's equivalent of about $100, on a ticket to the
show.</TE>
<TE>   When the women came on stage, "I had an epiphany: 'Oh, my god,
they look like me and my girlfriends,' " she said. "They looked so
incredible, powerful and desirable--I wanted to be that."</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Bentley wrote a story about the Crazy Horse strippers for
Allure magazine, "but that didn't satisfy me. I still wanted to get
up there."</TE>
<TE>   The club's owner, Alain Bernardin, refused her request to dance at
the club. But her obsession remained, and it intensified after she
left the ballet company.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably wanted to get back on stage," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her injury had been devastating, but having already received
attention from her first book, "Winter Season, A Dancer's Journal"
(Random, 1989), the timing was good, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had another career I could go to, which is almost unheard of
for a professional ballet dancer," she said. "God gave me the dance
experience so I could write about it."</TE>
<TE>   For Bentley, who has spent the last decade in Los Angeles, the
desire to look, and to be looked at, found expression in her dual
career as a dancer and a writer: "Wanting to be in the spotlight and
away from it," she said. "The great desire to be seen and the great
terror of being seen." Fear helped get her on stage at the Blue
Angel.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking my own taboos, it was a great statement of freedom," she
said. "Not just to be naked ... but changing my identity." Having
perceived of herself as "a good girl," she wanted to rebel, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was scary, but good scary," she said. "How are they going to
react? It's a classic test of your female sexual power. Are they
going to like what they see? And it was exciting to be able to see
somebody, and their reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the crowd at Lincoln Center, the club audience was close.
"Those sitting by the stage are within touching distance," she said.
"Needless to say, it's more intimate."</TE>
<TE>   What she hadn't anticipated was the pleasure stripping gave her.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it," she said, adding that
she still keeps the money earned that night, $89, in her bedside
drawer next to her black Bible.</TE>
<TE>   "My striptease is very symbolic to me." And since it was the
genesis of her new book, it seemed appropriate to include it, as "a
very personal introduction," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Will people talk about it? I suppose. But it's not just about my
stripping and my nudity. It's about a bigger thing"--feminism and
sexual power.</TE>
<TE>   "Feminism over the years [has claimed] women wanted to be like
men. But we're totally different," Bentley said. "One should
celebrate women's sexuality. Like verbal power. To celebrate it, to
use it, to embrace it, is to say, 'I've got it, and it's a good
thing.' That's a good feminist thing ....We should take more
responsibility for our sexual powers, and use these powers more."</TE>
<TE>   After all, Bentley said, "what women want from being liberated is
power."</TE>
<TE>   She bristles at the notion of the stripper as a victim. If it's a
choice, it's empowering, she said. And that destabilizes the notion
that the woman on stage is an object.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what we all want to be, the subject looking at the object."
In this case, she said, the object is the audience. "Who's the
subject? Who's the object?" she said. "Those [questions] interest
me."</TE>
<TE>   She's unafraid to be both.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a sexy chick ... who's published by Yale University Press,"
she said. "Deal with it."</TE>

<HD>Mr. K and the Z Are Back</HD>
<DH>Nissan's car and the man who nurtured it reemerge after a
hiatus</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACKSON SELLERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Yutaka Katayama, better known as "Mr. K" to generations of Datsun and
Z-car fans, has been waiting a long time for this. The Z, which he
fathered in 1969 as president of Nissan USA, is back this week after
a hiatus of six years.</LD>
<LD>   The first of the Z sport cars was the famous 240Z, with a
six-cylinder engine that basically was the same as the four-holer
powering the Datsun 510s of the day. The 260 and 280Zs and the 280
and 300ZXs followed, with the line discontinued in 1996. This time
around, the car emerges as the 350Z, the most powerful yet.</LD>
<LD>   On a sunny spring day, Mr. K and I journeyed together to Nissan's
Oppama plant in Yokosuka, 31 miles south of central Tokyo. This is
the plant where the 350Z will be assembled.</LD>
<TE>   Mr. K, 92 years old, has been my friend ever since I wrote a
modest piece two years ago about my beloved 1972 Datsun 510 station
wagon, which has cruised more than 300,000 miles and still is going
strong (Highway 1, July 19, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat to my surprise, I received dozens of e-mails from Datsun
fans on both sides of the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   One came from a Mr. Katayama in Tokyo. He introduced himself as an
"old salesman struggling with a new computer." My story brought back
good memories, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It was only when I saw his e-mail address--mr.k@drmteam .com--that
I realized this was the legendary Mr. K, who so successfully marketed
Datsuns and Z cars in the U.S. in the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   I had thought he was dead, but here he was, still alive and
active. He had retired from Nissan in 1977, shortly after he was
yanked back to Tokyo and placed in an office so small that it shocked
visitors from America.</TE>
<TE>   As he aged in retirement, his legend continued to grow. Scores of
510 and Z-car clubs sought him out. They wanted his presence at
Datsun/Z functions and his autograph on memorabilia. They still do.</TE>
<TE>   Rather quickly, Mr. K and I became close. We dine together when I
vacation in Japan, a nation with which I have a decades-long
association. We get together when he visits Los Angeles. I'm an old
man myself, now 70, but still young in Mr. K's eyes. He has become an
unlikely father figure to me. He was born in 1909, just two months
after the birth of my biological father.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Mr. K--long retired from Nissan but even more influential
than before--made a sales pitch to Carlos Ghosn, then the new
president and chief executive of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring back the Z," he urged.</TE>
<TE>   It was an easy sell. When Ghosn was with Michelin years ago, he
drove a Z and loved it. After taking over at Nissan, he wondered why
there was no longer a Z car. He promised Mr. K that a new Z would
come out within three years.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly three years later, Ghosn made good on his promise.</TE>
<TE>   The original 350Z production goal at Yokosuka's Oppama plant was
set at 2,500 cars a month. But advance sales were so brisk that the
figure was doubled.</TE>
<TE>   For me, the very name "Yokosuka" reeks with nostalgia. As a young
Navy officer nearly half a century ago, I became quite familiar with
the port. My old warship, a Fletcher-class destroyer that survived
eight Pacific War battles, steamed in and out of Yokosuka over a
three-year period while I served as her communications officer in the
'50s. I was now returning to the exotic seaport of my youth.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, Yokosuka is where the Japanese battleship
Mikasa is enshrined. The Mikasa, Admiral Heihachiro Togo's victorious
flagship in the Russo-Japanese War of the early 20th century, has a
tenuous but naggingly constant relationship with the Nissan Z car.</TE>
<TE>   A pacifist if ever there was one, Mr. K becomes uncomfortable and
a little defensive when the Z car is associated with a huge Japanese
military triumph. "Love cars, love people, love life" has been his
personal motto for decades. But he understands why the matter keeps
coming up. He knows he started the rumor in 1969 when the 240Z burst
onto the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1905, the Russian Baltic Fleet steamed along the Chinese
coast, bound for Japan, determined to teach the uppity Japanese a
lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Issuing orders from the sand-bagged bridge of the Mikasa, Admiral
Togo positioned his fleet to meet the Russians in the Strait of
Tsushima between Japan and Korea. He hoisted the international naval
"Z" flag, which in this battle was a coded signal meaning "Let every
man strive to the utmost." Togo's superior seamanship enabled the
Japanese to smash the Russian fleet and win the war in a shockingly
short time.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-five years later, in 1960, Katayama, then 50, was headed for
America to market Nissan Motor cars. His older brother, a fan of
Admiral Togo, gave him a Z flag, wishing him well in a foreign
country.</TE>
<TE>   Datsun sales were slow at first. Masataka Usami, 75, of San Juan
Capistrano, who in those times was Mr. K's right-hand man, recalls
that sales often totaled only six Datsuns a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the names of all Datsun owners and we would rush to their
homes in the morning if the cars wouldn't start," he said. "They fed
us breakfast." Usami became "Mr. USA" to Katayama's "Mr. K." The
monikers were easier for Americans to remember.</TE>
<TE>   Sales picked up as Mr. K assumed the Nissan USA presidency in
1965, then rose sharply with the debut of the 1968 Datsun 510. The
240Z sports car, for which Mr. K badgered Nissan management for
years, came out in late 1969 in the midst of vigorous Datsun 510
sales. As the spiffy cars spilled onto a San Pedro dock, Mr. K,
always a salesman, pulled out his brother's Z flag as a motivating
symbol: Let every man strive to the utmost--to sell 240Zs.</TE>
<TE>   In defiance of his Tokyo superiors, he and his colleagues pried
off Nissan-blessed Fairlady emblems and replaced them with 240Z
badges. In effect, Mr. K renamed the car for the American market. The
numbers indicated the size of the engine, 2.4 liters in this case,
and the Z came not from Mr. K's old battle flag but straight from
Nissan's official project name--Z for "zenith."</TE>
<TE>   On this fine spring morning, more than 30 years later, a Nissan
driver picked me up at my Shinjuku hotel and drove me to Mr. K's home
in Setagaya, another of Tokyo's myriad wards. Mr. K and his wife,
Masako, were waiting outside. He is tall for a Japanese, close to 6
feet, and weighs more than 200 pounds, while she is tiny, probably
weighing no more than 100 pounds. They have been married for 65 years
and have four children.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. K's English is good, while the best to be said about my
Japanese is that it is improving. So as we rode to the Z factory, we
spoke in English as we always do.</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling Nissan Oppama plant is laid out on what once was a
Japanese military airfield. General Manager Yoshitaka Shimada gave us
an overview of Nissan's plans to produce thousands of 350Zs per
month. "If I don't meet the schedule ... " he said, pausing for a
moment, at a loss for English words. He drew his forefinger across
his throat, a gesture understood in any language.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. K nudged me. "I worked with his father," he said. It seems
that Shinkichi Shimada had run the Nissan Shatai plant on the coast
of Sagami Bay, about 18 miles away, where all previous Z cars were
manufactured. We laughed about it, my friend and I. Over the years, I
too have worked with the children of my peers. It's what happens when
you stay on the job for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   We were shown the Oppama wharf, where as many as 4,000 cars can be
loaded onto specially designed ships bound for America or elsewhere.
We saw one of the body manufacturing lines in operation. Twelve
robots do all the welding and only four human beings supervise. On
the assembly line, there were no robots but plenty of labor-saving
devices.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the tour, a prototype 350Z sat gleaming, ready for
our inspection. Mr. K liked the overall design. His only reservation
was the surface-mounted door handle. He would have preferred inset
flush handles but was philosophical about it. "You know how designers
are," he said. "They have ideas of their own."</TE>
<TE>   This reminded him that the former Z was substantially redesigned
in 1979. "I didn't much like it," he said. Then he slapped his
fingers to his mouth, adding in a lower voice: "Oh, I shouldn't say
that."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. K has had more than a few clashes with Nissan designers. When
the original 240Z was being designed 30-odd years ago, he proved a
thorn in the sides of those charged with putting shape to an idea.</TE>
<TE>   He made numerous trips to Tokyo until he was satisfied that the
car would appeal to Americans, not just to Japanese designers.</TE>
<TE>   As we were leaving the Oppama plant, Shimada presented us with
identical gift-wrapped boxes. They were intriguingly heavy. I eagerly
opened mine before we were hardly out of the parking lot. It was a
marvelously detailed scale model of the 1932 "First Datsun." Mr. K,
knowing his gift was the same, said: "Oh, good. I don't have that
one."</TE>
<TE>   That evening, after we got back to Tokyo, there was a hotel dinner
hosted by Norio Matsumura, Nissan's executive vice president of
global sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end, Matsumura brought out a contract for Mr. K. He
stamped it with his personal hanko, the traditional seal that
replaces the Western signature on official Japanese documents. At
that moment, Mr. K became a Nissan employee again.</TE>
<TE>   A box of newly minted name cards accompanied the contract. Mr. K
beamed, flashing his trademark grin as he handed me the first card
out of the box.</TE>
<TE>   "Yutaka Katayama," it said. "Advisor, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd."</TE>
<TE>   The Z was back, and so was Mr. K.</TE>

<HD>New Rules but Old Car? Tire Guard May Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators are requiring auto makers to start equipping new
cars and light trucks with some type of tire pressure monitor. But
what about all those passenger vehicles out there that aren't new?</LD>
<LD>   Retrofitting with one of the systems being required on new
vehicles can be prohibitively expensive, costing hundreds of dollars.
If you don't have anti-lock braking, one type of system won't work
anyhow.</LD>
<LD>   A company in Fullerton, Tire Guard USA, may have an affordable
answer.</LD>
<TE>   Tire Guard (www.tireguardusa .com) markets a system, developed in
Taiwan, that uses individual monitors, preset to specific tire
pressures and mounted on each valve stem.</TE>
<TE>   The screw-on monitors take an air pressure reading from the tire,
and if it is within preset limits, the tip of the monitor shows
green.</TE>
<TE>   As pressure in the tire drops, the green band diminishes and other
bands appear--first yellow, then red--letting the driver know it is
time to fill the tire with air.</TE>
<TE>   You must walk around the car to look at the things--there's no
convenient gauge on the dash, but with that little bit of effort the
system seems to work pretty well.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Weisman, Tire Guard's chief executive, says the monitors show
pressure differences in 4-pound increments. So on a tire rated at 36
pounds per square inch of pressure, or 36 psi, the yellow band should
appear at 32 pounds, the red at 28, Weisman says.</TE>
<TE>   We bought and mounted a test set from the company on a 1990 Ford
Taurus fitted with 15-inch factory alloy wheels and 205/65R15 radial
tires. The monitors were set for 36 psi, and when the tires were
inflated to that limit, their caps all showed bright green.</TE>
<TE>   They also showed green at 34 psi and 32 psi--and, in fact, didn't
display yellow until 30 pounds, or red until pressure was down to 27
psi. That 9-pound drop represents a 25% difference in tire pressure.</TE>
<TE>   We also tested a set rated at 30 psi and found it a little more
responsive, with yellow showing up when tire pressure fell to 27 psi
and red showing at 25 psi, a 17% drop from 30.</TE>
<TE>   The federal standard for pressure-averaging monitors on new cars
and trucks is a 30% fluctuation from the recommended tire pressure,
so the Tire Guard system, at least when new, seems to provide an
earlier warning.</TE>
<TE>   Weisman says the monitors, available at many leading tire
retailers for $19.95 for a set of four, last about three years, or
about as long as a set of tires.</TE>
<TE>   One potential drawback is aesthetics. People often pay beaucoup
bucks for fancy alloy wheels, and the Tire Guard monitors make the
valve stems a pretty visible item.</TE>
<TE>   Weisman says the few complaints he has received thus far are
mostly from Harley-Davidson dealers, who say their customers don't
like the look on their bikes.</TE>

<HD>Applying Pressure to Boost Tire Safety</HD>
<DH>The deadly Firestone saga has inspired a federal mandate
that calls for the phasing in of monitors on all new cars and light
trucks by 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK POPELY</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In response to consumer and lawmaker outrage over the accidents,
injuries and deaths blamed on faulty and since- recalled Firestone
tires, the federal government has mandated that tire pressure
monitors be phased in as standard equipment on cars and light trucks
over three years, beginning Nov. 1, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Rules set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
will require manufacturers to install monitors on 10% of their
vehicles the first year, 35% the second and 65% the third, before
reaching 100% in 2006.</LD>
<LD>   The monitors must activate a dashboard warning when a tire is low
on air; auto makers may use one of two systems to meet the rule. In
2006, regulators are expected to eliminate the choice and require all
auto makers to use the same type of monitor.</LD>
<TE>   The so-called direct system has air pressure monitors on each
wheel and is designed to alert the driver when pressure in any tire
drops by more than 25%. The sensors typically convey information to
the dashboard monitor via low-frequency radio waves.</TE>
<TE>   The indirect system uses sensors from the vehicle's anti-lock
braking system to measure the rotation of all four tires and can
detect whether any is significantly different from the others. The
indirect system activates a warning when pressure in one tire drops
30% below the pressure of at least one other, but does not specify
which tire is low.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA regulators favor the direct system--which costs at least $66
per vehicle, according to agency estimates, versus as little as $13
or less for the indirect type--because it alerts the driver when any
tire loses air. With the indirect system, NHTSA says, there is no
warning if all four tires lose an equal amount of air pressure, even
if the loss is greater than 30%.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, however, has countered that using the
indirect system would lower the cost and increase the rate of
installation of anti-lock braking on new vehicles (currently at 67%).
Although auto makers support the cost argument, none has promised to
increase anti-lock brake installation.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA's compromise was to allow both systems until Nov. 1, 2006,
when the agency will require monitors on all new vehicles. NHTSA will
issue a final rule by Nov. 1, 2005, using data collected on both
systems to decide whether to select one of those already in use or to
recommend another.</TE>
<TE>   Tire pressure monitors were one requirement of TREAD, the
Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation
Act, passed by Congress in 2000 after investigations into tread
failure on Firestone tires. Low tire pressure was cited as a cause of
tread failures that contributed to accidents that claimed at least
271 lives.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA's compromise plan quickly drew complaints. Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen and a former NHTSA administrator, said
the group would sue to require the direct system, which it says will
save more lives.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubber Manufacturers Assn., a trade group for tire makers,
said a tire running at 25% to 30% below its recommended air pressure
cannot carry a full load and is more apt to fail.</TE>

<HD>Couple Say They Get No Charge Out of Their Toyota Prius
Hybrid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNE WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My husband and I bought a 2002 Toyota Prius hybrid in
April. We thought it would be perfect for our lifestyle--great for
driving short distances and terrific fuel efficiency.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the car, which is propelled by a combination of
gasoline and electric power, kept losing its charge. Twice my
handicapped, 76-year-old husband was almost stuck in garages because
the Prius wouldn't start. Toyota ads say the car is self-charging and
never has to be plugged in like an electric vehicle. That wasn't our
experience. Each time it died, we had to have it towed to the
dealership.</LD>
<LD>   The service manager told us there was nothing wrong with the car.
He said we just weren't driving it enough. We were told that when
we're on a weeklong vacation we need to have someone drive the car to
keep it charged. It was like having a pet that had to be walked every
day.</LD>
<TE>   None of this was disclosed to us at the time of purchase. The
salesmen never told us we had to drive it a certain amount to keep
the battery charged.</TE>
<TE>   Is this typical of hybrid cars?</TE>
<TE>   --M.C., Century City</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No, said Toyota spokesman Sam Butto. Your experience with
Toyota's first "green" car appears to be an "isolated incident," he
told us. Though the owner's manual states that not operating the
vehicle for long periods can cause the battery to go dead or affect
it, Butto said the Prius usually would not lose its charge unless it
had been idle for a couple of months or more.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Honda's hybrid, Insight, is self-charging and will keep
a battery charge indefinitely, Honda spokesman Art Garner said. Honda
has heard no complaints that the Insight loses its charge.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what the Century City couple may have been told by a
dealership service manager, Butto said there is no magic number of
miles or days the Prius needs to be driven to stay charged. "The car
should have been starting up for them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hybrid system in the Prius automatically switches the power in
the vehicle to either gasoline or electric battery, depending on
driving conditions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if you're driving on the highway and need to
accelerate to merge, the gas and electric motor work together to
provide the power. If the car is being driven in slower stop-and-go
traffic, the gasoline part of the system would turn off.</TE>
<TE>   After the couple vehemently complained about the problem, the
dealership agreed to buy back the vehicle last month. Though M.C. and
her husband had purchased the car for $23,400, including tax and
license fees, the dealer bought it back for only $18,300. The couple,
however, felt they deserved a full refund.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd only had the car for three months and it had 600 miles on
it. It's only $5,000, but we really feel it's a matter of principle,"
M.C. said. "Dealing with the car was stressful. We had been told if
we just drove the car more it wouldn't die."</TE>
<TE>   But M.C. said she drove the Prius one week every day except
Sunday. The next day, Monday, the car wouldn't start.</TE>
<TE>   The couple went back to Toyota and threatened to sue in
small-claims court if the auto maker didn't fully refund their money.
They also contacted auto safety advocate Rosemary Shahan at Citizens
for Auto Reliability and Safety about their complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Toyota agreed to give the couple a full refund,
maintaining that the couple's experience with the vehicle was an
isolated one.</TE>
<TE>   Their particular car probably was a lemon, Shahan said, adding
that customers typically have been pleased with the Prius. This was
the first such complaint she'd heard about the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Shahan, whose advocacy group often battles auto makers who resist
buying back defective vehicles, praised Toyota's decision to fully
reimburse the couple.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that the car was dead because the couple didn't drive
it enough made no sense, Shahan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody should buy a car and expect to have to walk it like a pet
to keep it running."</TE>

<HD>Buttermilk's Subtle Charm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABBY MANDEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buttermilk is understated--a quiet, old-fashioned ingredient that
brings its own small delight to summer dishes. Yet a bit of
buttermilk imparts a tangy and refreshing edge to cakes, salad
dressings, even ice cream.</LD>
<LD>   The secret is its sour taste, which adds a little acidity but also
a homeyness. Originally, buttermilk was the leftover milk after
churning butter from whole cream. It's now typically made from
pasteurized skim milk, with a culture added to develop the flavor and
produce a creamier texture.</LD>
<LD>   You might not think of buttermilk as a flavoring for ice cream,
but it works perfectly. This vanilla bean ice cream is not as
sweet--but also not as bland--as scoops of vanilla; try it with
summer berries or as a topping for fruit crisps and pies.</LD>
<TE>   The lemon buttermilk muffins capture that old-time taste, and
guess what--buttermilk marries well with lemon. Serve the muffins for
breakfast or with afternoon tea or coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The cake, included here from "The Cake Bible," is a wonderful warm
weather dessert--the buttermilk enriches the cake's buttery taste.
It's best served with whipped cream and fresh fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Buttermilk is lower in fat and cholesterol than regular milk and
comes in low-fat varieties. It will last up to two weeks in the
refrigerator, but often will be fine for baking even after the
expiration date.</TE>
<TE>   You can create a buttermilk substitute when baking if you have
none on hand: Add enough milk to one tablespoon of lemon juice or
white vinegar to equal one cup. Stir and let the mixture stand about
five minutes. Buttermilk should not be substituted for regular milk
in recipes, however.</TE>

<TE>   Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape the seeds

medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, mix the sugar and eggs with an electric mixer until
thick and yellow, 1 minute. Stir in some of the hot cream, then
return the mixture to the pan. Cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.</TE>

lumps. Press on the vanilla bean to extract all the seeds and flavor.
Discard the pod. Stir in the buttermilk. Chill the mixture
thoroughly, at least 5 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's

<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from "The Cake Bible" by Rose Levy Beranbaum
(William Morrow, 1988). The cake is delicious with sweetened whipped
cream and sliced peaches and berries.</TE>
<TE>   4 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup buttermilk, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 cups sifted cake flour</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and lightly flour a 9-inch
round cake pan, or grease a 9-inch springform pan, line the bottom
with parchment or wax paper, grease again and flour lightly.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly combine the yolks, 3 tablespoons of buttermilk and the
vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder
and salt and mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add the butter
and remaining buttermilk. Mix on low until the dry ingredients are
moistened. Increase the speed to medium (high speed if using a hand
mixer) and beat 1 1/2 minutes to aerate and develop the cake's
structure. Scrape down the sides. Gradually add the egg mixture in 3
batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate
the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides.</TE>
<TE>   Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the surface with a
spatula. The pan will be about half full. Bake until a tester
inserted near the center comes out clean and the cake springs back
when pressed in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. The cake should start
to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Loosen the
sides with a small metal spatula and invert onto a greased wire rack.
To prevent splitting, re-invert so that the top is up and cool
completely before wrapping airtight.</TE>

<HD>Perfection, With a Twist of Lime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's almost embarrassing. But to my mind, the greatest of all
cocktails is not the martini, not the gimlet, not the scotch and
soda. It's not a drink that we associate with Hemingway, movie stars
or the wits of the Algonquin Round Table. Rather, it's what our
parents drank. It's the gin and tonic.</LD>
<LD>   Before objecting that Campari and soda is infinitely more
sophisticated, which it is, treat yourself one hot summer evening to
a gin and tonic. No other drink has such happy chemistry. Once mixed,
it is so much more than the sum of its parts: better than gin, better
than tonic, better than ice. It gives meaning to lime. Then consider
what it does. A gin and tonic cools you down, picks you up, soothes
your nerves and tantalizes your senses.</LD>
<LD>   The recipe could scarcely be simpler: 2 ounces gin, 5 ounces
tonic, a tall glass of ice and a wedge of lime. But the recipe for
this best of all drinks was not concocted overnight. First, about 450
years or so ago, the Dutch had to invent gin by distilling a mix of
barley, rye and corn, then infusing it with essential oils of juniper
berries, anise and various spices.</LD>
<TE>   By the 18th century, across the channel, the British had busily
anglicized the liquor, mainly in their washtubs. England became the
nation of inebriates recorded in artist William Hogarth's engraving
"Gin Lane." Successive Gin Acts and reforms left the gin industry in
the hands of professional distillers, which throughout the 19th
century set the modern and universal standard for dry bar gins.</TE>
<TE>   We have an 18th century English inventor, Joseph Priestley, to
thank for developing a mechanical process to carbonate water, and a
German, Jean Jacob Schweppe, for refining the process to an
industrial standard. Somewhere along the line, the British in India
dropped quinine, an antimalarial powder distilled from tree bark,
into Priestley's bubbly. Sugar followed to temper the bitterness of
the quinine. Tonic had been born.</TE>
<TE>   Gin was swirled in to improve the cure. Lime too. As the drink
caught on after the 1930s, America, home of the dream fridge and
scorching summer, can be thanked for making ice de rigueur.</TE>
<TE>   Gin and tonic became the epitome of the good life, served at golf
courses, on yachts, by pools--until the food boom of the 1980s, when
sophisticates turned to wines. Though martinis managed a comeback in
the 1990s, gin and tonic remained outcast, yesterday's drink.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the worst strike against it was its affordability. Using
good gin in a gin and tonic is a waste. The expensive clay jugs of
Dutch genever are all very folklorique, and the gin inside is
wonderful, but it is best served in the Dutch way: frozen, neat, in
frosted shot glasses, as accompaniment to two filets of salted
herring.</TE>
<TE>   As for the best English gins, the Tanqueray and Bombay brands,
save these for martinis. Gin and tonics demand only the stock bar
gins, Gilbey, Gordon's or Beefeater. The magic is in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   For this, two ingredients require care. A gin and tonic should
have absolutely fresh tonic and fresh lime. If tonic isn't bursting
to get out of the bottle, it's flat. Throw it away. Once poured,
tonic should effervesce so furiously that it tickles your lips.</TE>
<TE>   If you can't get fresh lime, don't get any. Bottled lime juice
tastes dead. The lime essence in gin and tonic comes from a class of
compounds called terpenes. These are the great seducers of good plant
smells. They tease us with the scent of pines at Christmas and cut
grass in summer.</TE>
<TE>   They are released when certain plants are cut or bruised; then
they quickly fade away. In the case of the gin and tonic, they are
released when a knife pierces a lime's skin and a bartender gives the
newly cut wedge a triumphant squeeze. Riotous bubbles in the tonic
then flaunt these captivating, all-too-ephemeral scents beneath our
noses.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, a third detail: The ice should be fresh. If the last cubes in
the house must be chiseled out from beneath a 10-month-old turkey,
opt for a beer instead. Better yet, grab cab fare and go to a bar.</TE>
<TE>   As for venue, there was a phase in the restaurant boom in the
1980s when it was fashionable for star chefs to complain about
customers who came to their restaurants only to drink gin and tonics
and eat steaks. Reader, if a waiter sneers at you for ordering a gin
and tonic as an aperitif, it's a snob joint. The problem is with the
restaurant, not you, not the drink. A gin and tonic goes down just as
nicely in a gastronomic temple as by a hotel poolside, or in a
suburban backyard.</TE>
<TE>   That's what makes it the tallest of tall drinks.</TE>

<HD>A Day in the Life, at 90</HD>
<DH>Keeping up with Julia Child, who has a new home, a new book
deal and a balky oven</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTECITO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>We knock on the door of Julia Child's condominium half an hour early.
She appears after a minute. "Hello, dearie," she says and apologizes
for being busy. She points us toward the living room. "Here's the
paper. I'll be out when I'm done with these radio interviews."</LD>
<LD>   Like the rest of her apartment, the living room is small but
comfortable. There's a dining table just big enough for four tucked
in one corner, a couch against one wall and a couple of upholstered
chairs. The kitchen is the size of a boat's galley and the bedroom
doubles as her office with a computer and fax machine.</LD>
<LD>   From the bedroom come whispers of the interviews, her famous
voice, high-pitched and reedy. Despite the endless attempts, it seems
impossible to parody accurately. Imitations invariably only hit the
one public note of enthusiastic instruction; in private there is a
whole range of moods.</LD>
<TE>   After 45 minutes or so, Child comes trundling out with her walker
and plops heavily into a chair. "Those kinds of interviews are so
tiresome, don't you think?" she asks, as if everyone spends their
mornings being questioned for national audiences.</TE>
<TE>   " 'What's your favorite restaurant?' " she imitates the hapless
radio interviewers. " 'What's your funniest kitchen disaster?'
'What's your favorite comfort food?' 'What do you want for your last
meal on Earth?' " At this last, she shakes her head in wonder, both
at the gall of someone asking such a question and the intellectual
laziness that would prompt it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just not very interesting, is it?" she says. Child turns
90 next week, and that is probably the worst thing she can say about
anything. The occasion is something of a national celebration. Her
actual birthday, Aug. 15, will be spent as part of her treasured
annual summer vacation in a big house by the sea in Maine with
assorted nieces and nephews and their children.</TE>
<TE>   But first there will have been fund-raising parties in 20
restaurants around the country and parties at Copia in Napa, the
Mondavi-backed wine and food museum she is so enthusiastic about.
Then after Maine, she'll head down to Washington, D.C., where an
exact replica of her old kitchen will be enshrined in the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Julia Child is American food's Elvis. She not only
played a prominent part in popularizing fine cooking in this country,
she came to represent it. This is not a role she sought (no one plans
to become an icon), but it is one she wears easily. Spend some time
with her and you quickly understand that there is little or no
separation between the public and private Julias. Wherever she goes,
she's the center of attention--and after 40 years, she's used to it.</TE>
<TE>   After a dim sum lunch one day in a Los Angeles restaurant, the
entire Chinese staff lines up to have pictures taken with her.
Tirelessly, leaning on her walker, she takes first a group shot, then
individual ones one after another. Her one proviso: "Only if they're
not used for any kind of publicity." She has never allowed her name
to be used to endorse a product of any kind.</TE>
<TE>   Another time at a small informal beach-side restaurant in Santa
Barbara, she's dining with friends when a distinguished looking
gentleman of about her vintage sidles up to the table and, awkwardly
passes her a note. She opens it up and reads: "My wife and I have
been making your cucumber soup for 40 years. Thank you for all the
wonderful meals." She carefully folds it back up without visible
reaction. You get the feeling this happens a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the notoriously catty food world, almost no one has a bad
thing to say about Child. That some of her recipes may be a bit dated
is about the worst. But that's probably inevitable given that
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking" was published 40 years ago and
that almost everyone in food today either learned to cook from it or
learned to cook from someone who had.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that is so wonderful about this culinary profession of
ours is that it is like a big family," she says repeatedly. "People
love what they're doing, and they love to share it with other
people."</TE>
<TE>   But don't mistake her for a goody-two-shoes. She's fond of a good
dirty joke. She loves to gossip. And she occasionally displays a
wicked sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic
Services (doing paperwork mainly; she laughs at the repeated reports
that she was a spy). One of her office's projects was to develop a
shark repellent to help airmen downed at sea. But they could get no
support from the Navy, she says, because "we couldn't get the Navy to
admit that sharks ate Navy men. They didn't like to say, 'Dear Mrs.
So-and-So, your son was eaten by a shark. They'd much rather say:
'Your gallant son was lost at sea.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then one day, a shark was caught and they opened him up and found
he had some undigested parts of people in his stomach. One of them
still had fingerprints, and it turned out to be a Navy man. There was
such glee in our office that they had finally proven a Navy man could
be eaten by a shark."</TE>
<TE>   The last year and a half has been a period of tremendous change
for Child. Last fall she closed up the big house in Cambridge, Mass.,
where she'd lived for more than 40 years. She donated the structure
to her alma mater, Smith College, and distributed most of her
belongings among her family. The bulk of her cookbook collection went
to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard, the kitchen to a grateful
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is back home. With her New England twang and close
association with Boston, some people might be surprised that Child is
actually a Californian. She was born Julia McWilliams in Pasadena in
1912 to a well-to-do family that appreciated good food.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was very interested in setting a good table and she
always had a good cook," Child remembers. "And I was always hungry. I
always ate with great pleasure, even if I didn't know much about it."</TE>
<TE>   The place she calls her "nice little pad" is a very nice luxury
planned community--she resists calling it a retirement home--"I'm not
retired, am I?"</TE>
<TE>   Her apartment is comfortable enough, but there is a sense of a
life stripped to its essentials. The living room is dominated by two
striking paintings by her late husband, Paul: one a fairly
representational look down a vertiginous cliff to the ocean in
Mendocino, the other a nearly Cubist brightly patterned impression of
a village in southern France.</TE>
<TE>   One entire wall in the living room is devoted to a bookcase that
seems to be the beating heart of the house. Here, cheek by jowl, is
everything from food research ("Uniform Retail Meat Identity
Standards Manual" and Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking") to
fiction (several Edith Wharton novels, a collection of Colette short
stories, mysteries by her favorite authors Linda Fairstein, Sue
Grafton and Mary Higgins Clark, and even a "Harry Potter").</TE>
<TE>   On the table by the couch rests current reading: Nancy Milford's
new biography of Edna St. Vincent Millay and a 2002 almanac.</TE>
<TE>   Here there are gardeners to take care of the flowers on her back
patio and a central dining room whose breakfast bacon she praises
highly. Most important, there is medical help always available. In
the last year and a half, she has had three operations on her back to
relieve a pinched nerve that made walking painful. Just last month
she was noticeably thin and tired. "The worst part about all of the
surgery was I didn't feel like eating," she says. "That was
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   But now her appetite has returned and she seems hale and hearty.
Her only apparent concessions to age are her walker--which she hopes
to shed soon--and a handicapped parking sticker, which she doesn't
("These things are worth their weight in gold," she chortles as we
pull into a convenient spot in a crowded Montecito parking lot).</TE>
<TE>   She still lives alone, thanks to the care supplied by the complex.
During the day her longtime assistant, Stephanie Hersh, who teaches
kids' cooking classes and has her master's degree in food history
from Boston University, comes by to help take care of business.</TE>
<TE>   "At my age, it's nice that nobody needs to worry about me,
including myself," Child says. "I think people are very foolish and
very selfish when they get to be around 80 and they haven't decided
what their final days are going to be. It's very difficult for the
family.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put it off and something happens, you can get dumped. Any
of these places, if you can't come in under your own steam, you can't
come in. They won't even look at you if you have to be carted in."</TE>
<TE>   Child doesn't talk much about her age or mortality. Glooming about
is not for her. Yet her grief over her husband's death in 1994 is
palpable still and perhaps a little complicated. He died in a nursing
home after five years of declining health.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very difficult to see someone going downhill that way,"
she says. Especially, it is pointed out, when she was still doing so
well herself. "Exactly, exactly," she agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "For five years he really didn't know what was going on. Even so,
when he died, it was a real shock--him not being there. It's so
final. It's a real shame, because he would have loved all of this."</TE>
<TE>   Later she gently counsels a longtime friend who is thinking about
getting married to someone much younger (Paul was a decade older than
her): "Marry a woman your own age or older. You don't want to leave
them alone. If Paul had been my age, I'd still have him around."</TE>
<TE>   Her current project is a book about their years in France during
the 1950s. Paul was a talented photographer as well as painter (it's
his photos that illustrate the early editions of Waverly Root's
"Foods of France") and this will be a combination of pictures and
memoir with maybe a few recipes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking with my editor about it the other day," she says,
referring to Judith Jones. "I just have to take two or three days a
week and shut everything else out, turn off the phone. I'll get
started as soon as I'm done with all of this [birthday celebration]."</TE>
<TE>   At the table, Child is still an enthusiastic and discerning eater.
Her appreciation for French food is profound, for other
cuisines--with the exception of Chinese--less so. "I must say, I'm
not terribly pleased with all the Italian-esque food we're getting
lately," she says. "I'm not mad about pasta," pronouncing it in the
New England way, past-a.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever she is, she analyzes every dish, cutting quickly to the
heart of it. "This is a little thick, don't you think? I wonder how
long it's been sitting," she says of a soup one day. On another:
"Ground cooked rice is such a wonderfully subtle thickener. It's a
shame people don't use it more."</TE>
<TE>   She loves to talk about meals and cooking, wine and cooks, but her
appreciation is not limited to haute cuisine. Ask and Julia can tell
you the location of every In-N-Out Burger between Santa Barbara and
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember having this nephew come to visit and it happened to be
a weekend when there were a lot of food people around. As he left, I
asked him, 'Did you ever spend a whole weekend with people who never
discussed anything else but food?' He said, 'No.'</TE>
<TE>   "But there's always so much to talk about, isn't there?"</TE>
<TE>   Though she does cook for herself, she doesn't do it as often as
she used to. The kitchen is tiny. The only oven is a small
under-the-cupboard model of one of those new quick-cooking gadgets.
After a year and a half, she still hasn't learned to use it. It is
the bane of her existence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's got [programs] for different dishes," she says with
exasperation. "It tells you what to cook, you don't tell it. And the
book they give you doesn't tell you much about how it works, either.
It tells you how to make something called Hawaiian Chicken, but not a
roast chicken. I'm either going to find some way to short-circuit it
or I'm going to take it out to the trash."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that she's anti-technology. She is an avid fan of word
processors. "You can take something off, transpose it somewhere else,
save it somewhere, then present your publisher with a really nice,
clean manuscript," she says. "Oh, it was terrible, before. You'd have
to make four or five copies of everything and when you made a mistake
you'd have to erase every one."</TE>
<TE>   And the big Dell computer in the bedroom always seems to be on.</TE>
<TE>   "I love working," she says. "You don't have to retire nowadays, do
you? I don't even know what it would mean."</TE>

<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 15
minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe is from "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." A 40th
anniversary edition was published last year by Knopf.</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds tuna or swordfish cut into steaks 3/4 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   9 to 10 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon pepper, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 cup minced onions</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds tomatoes (about 5 large tomatoes), peeled, seeded, and
chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves mashed garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons tomato paste</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon flour blended to a paste with 1 tablespoon softened
butter</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   Remove the skin and cut the fish steaks into serving pieces. Blend
the salt and lemon juice in a 13x9-inch glass baking dish,then beat
in 6 tablespoons of the oil and half the pepper. Place the fish in
the dish and baste with the marinade. Cover with wax paper and
marinate 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature, turning and basting
the fish with the marinade several times. Drain the fish and dry it
thoroughly on paper towels. Discard the marinade, which will be
strong and fishy. Wash out the dish.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the fish rapidly in a large skillet over high heat in 3 to 4
tablespoons of very hot olive oil, a minute or two each side, to
brown lightly. Return the fish to the dish.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook the onions slowly in the
skillet for 5 minutes, until tender but not browned. Stir in the
tomato pulp, garlic, oregano, thyme, salt and remaining pepper. Cover
and cook slowly for 5 minutes. Correct the seasoning and spread the
tomato mixture over the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Place a cover or aluminum foil over the baking dish and place in
the lower third of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Pour in the wine
and bake 30 minutes more, turning the oven down to 325 degrees as
soon as the fish is simmering.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the fish to a serving platter, scraping the sauce off the
fish and back into the baking dish. Keep the fish warm for about 5
minutes while finishing the sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Boil down the sauce in a skillet over high heat until it has
reduced to about 2 cups. Stir in the tomato paste. Simmer for a
moment and correct the seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Off heat, beat in the flour and butter paste, and bring again to a
simmer for 1 minute. Stir in the chopped parsley, spoon the sauce
over the fish and serve.</TE>

<TE>   From "The Way to Cook" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1989). To puree the
garlic, place a peeled clove on a cutting board, smash it with the

<TE>   FRESH TOMATO SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup minced onions</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   6 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 or 2 large cloves garlic, pureed</TE>
<TE>   Pinch of saffron threads, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon dried orange peel</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   Cook the onions in the oil in a 2-quart covered saucepan over
medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until tender but not brown--6
to 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes; cover and cook slowly several
minutes until they have softened slightly. Stir in the thyme, bay
leaf, garlic, saffron and orange peel, if using; salt and pepper
lightly to taste. Simmer slowly, partially covered, for 30 minutes,
adding a little juice from the tomatoes if the sauce becomes too
thick. Taste carefully and correct the seasoning. Makes 2 1/2 cups.</TE>
<TE>   SOUFFLE</TE>
<TE>   2 (1 1/2-pound) eggplants</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups minced onions</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 cloves garlic, pureed</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups hot milk, divided</TE>
<TE>   3 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup coarsely grated Swiss cheese</TE>
<TE>   5 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   2 cups Fresh Tomato Sauce, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Steam the eggplants until tender, 40 to 45 minutes, depending on
size. They are done when soft and somewhat shriveled; a skewer will
pierce through one easily.</TE>
<TE>   Slice off the caps of the eggplants. Quarter them lengthwise--the
flesh should be soft and white. Scoop off all but 1/8 inch of flesh,
leaving the skin intact. Coarsely chop the flesh; reserve the skin.</TE>
<TE>   Set a large skillet over moderate heat, add a little olive oil and
cook the onions until tender, 5 minutes. Fold in the garlic and cook
a few seconds; blend in the eggplant flesh. Season with salt and
pepper, cover the pan and cook slowly 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until the eggplants are thoroughly tender. Break up the
eggplant flesh with a wooden spoon so that there are no large chunks.
Uncover, raise the heat and saute for several minutes, tossing to
brown very lightly. Fold in the parsley; taste and correct seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, oil another large nonstick skillet and brush the
eggplant skin with oil. Lay the skin flesh side down in the skillet
and set a lid or pie plate on top to flatten it. (You may not need
all the skin.) Cook slowly until the skin is tender but not browned,
5 to 10 minutes. Cut the skin into strips and arrange skin side down
in an oiled 2 1/2-quart baking dish.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan, then blend in the flour
to make a smooth paste. Stir over moderate heat until the butter and
flour foam together for 2 minutes without coloring more than a
buttery yellow. Remove from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   When the bubbling stops, pour in all but 1/2 cup of the hot milk,
whisking vigorously to blend. Then whisk rather slowly over medium
heat, reaching all over the bottom and sides of the pan, until the
sauce comes to a simmer. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes, stirring and thinning
out the sauce as necessary with dribbles of the milk.</TE>
<TE>   Beat the egg yolks into the white sauce, then fold in the cooked
eggplant flesh, salt and pepper to taste and the grated cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees and place a roasting pan with 1 inch
of water on a rack in the lower middle level. Beat the egg whites
until stiff but not dry, about 3 minutes. Stir a quarter of them into
the eggplant mixture; delicately fold in the rest. Being careful not
to disturb the eggplant skins, turn the souffle mixture into the
baking dish. Attach a double-thick strip of oiled aluminum foil
around the top of the dish, letting it come 2 inches above the rim
but no more than 1 inch below the rim--or it might siphon up the
water in the pan.</TE>
<TE>   Set the souffle in the pan of water;bake until it has puffed and
is browned lightly, 1 1/4 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the souffle from the oven and cool 15 minutes--it will sink
an inch or so. Remove the collar and turn a serving platter
upside-down over the dish; reverse the two to unmold the souffle. You
may wish to decorate the top with tomato cutouts and parsley. Pass
the tomato sauce separately. Serve hot, tepid or cold.</TE>

<LD>Almost every customer passing Richard Sager's stand at the Thousand
Oaks farmers market lurches to a stop before his outlandish magenta
cauliflower.</LD>
<LD>   "Irradiation," Sager says with a grin as passersby gawk. "Just
kidding--it's a new hybrid."</LD>
<LD>   There have been purple cauliflowers before, but Graffiti is the
first of its size that keeps its color when cooked. It's delicious
stir-fried with garlic and ginger.</LD>
<TE>   It's produce such as this that makes the Thousand Oaks market so
popular; it's first in sales among Ventura County markets, and it
draws growers from both the area and the San Joaquin Valley. Its
abundance of high-quality vegetables this season is stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the market's strictly enforced 3 p.m. starting time,
shoppers cluster around Linda Apkarian's stand, impatiently clutching
bags of her grapes. Along with conventional Flames and Black
Emeralds, the Reedley grower has two extraordinary new varieties:
Diamond Muscat, mostly used for making raisins, is small but very
sweet with intense musky flavor (unlike traditional muscats, it is
seedless); and "A29-67," an experimental Concord type bred for
Central Valley conditions, has the sweetness and taste of a Concord
without the seeds or tough skin.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Peacock of Dinuba has Rosa Bianca eggplant, a beautiful
lavender-skinned Italian heirloom with tender, mild-flavored flesh.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Watkins of Carpinteria displays fresh organic romaine and
redleaf lettuces, salad mix and dandelion greens. Meanwhile, Laroyce
Hicks, 72, of Santa Paula, calls her stand Grandma's Garden. She
sells flavorful Cherokee Purple heirloom tomatoes and tender young
yellow corn, along with sweet and juicy Valencia oranges.</TE>
<TE>   For the best stone fruit at Thursday's market, try the Fantasia
yellow nectarines offered by Perry Fife of Visalia. When introduced
in 1969, Fantasia was considered just a good commercial variety, but
in this age of bland low-acid fruit, it stands out as a champion of
old-fashioned flavor.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Last fall we stayed at the Putney Inn in Putney, Vt. We had
the baked onion and apple soup for dinner. Would the inn share the
recipe?</LD>
<LD>   PAULINE HAVLINA</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR PAULINE: The innkeeper, Randi Ziter, is delighted to share
the inn's adaptation of the classic French soup. Because of the inn's
location in southern Vermont--near apple orchards--adding the apples
seemed quite natural, she said.</TE>

<TE>   Baked Onion and Apple Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   To clarify the butter for this recipe, microwave 1/2 cup (1 stick)
of butter until melted, skim off the foam from the top, then pour off
the butter and discard any milky water on the bottom. You'll have
about 5 to 6 tablespoons.</TE>
<TE>   1 large or 2 small onions, thickly sliced (about 1 1/4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   5 to 6 tablespoons clarified butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sliced apples</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Calvados or Brandy</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 cup beef stock</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</TE>
<TE>   1/4 tablespoon coarsely ground pepper, 1/2 tablespoon whole
cloves, 1 star anise and 1 bay leaf, tied in cheesecloth to make a
sachet</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup apple cider or apple juice concentrate</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 croutons</TE>
<TE>   2 slices Cheddar cheese</TE>
<TE>   Cook the onions in the butter in a large skillet over medium-low
heat until browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the apples and cook until
softened, 5 minutes. Deglaze the pan with the wine and Calvados or
Brandy, scraping up any brown bits. Add the chicken and beef stocks,
the water and the thyme; bring to a boil. Add the spice sachet and
simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the apple concentrate and balsamic vinegar and season to taste
with salt and pepper. Remove the sachet.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, divide the soup between two heavy, oven-proof soup
crocks. Top each with croutons and a slice of cheese. Brown under the

<HD>How to Tame the Tostada</HD>

<LD>The typical tostada adds up to a mountain of fat and calories: First
there's the deep-fried tortilla base or shell, which is spread with a
liberal amount of refried beans. Then come the greens (no fat!), the
fish and big dollops of sour cream and guacamole. Talk about a heavy
meal.</LD>
<LD>   But don't despair. Our version starts out with an extra-thin corn
tortilla that's baked until crisp--not fried. Then, white beans are
mashed, combined with grilled onion, garlic and chile, and simmered
over low heat.</LD>
<LD>   The halibut filet is grilled without any oil. And instead of
finishing the tostada with rich sour cream and guacamole, a light
citrus dressing is drizzled over top. Here's one tostada you'll have
no problem eating.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fish Tostadas</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 25 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   2 (1-inch-thick) slices onion</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 serrano chile</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 (15-ounce) can white beans</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons lime juice, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound halibut filet</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 extra-thin corn tortillas</TE>
<TE>   4 cups shredded romaine</TE>
<TE>   1 cup yellow and red cherry tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   Cook the onion slices, 1 clove of garlic and the chile on a
well-seasoned grill pan over high heat or an outdoor grill until
charred on all sides and tender, about 5 minutes. Chop and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the beans reserving the liquid. Cook the beans over low heat
in a nonstick skillet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, mashing
until pureed. Stir in the onion, garlic, chile and 1/4 teaspoon of
salt. Stir in about 1/3 cup of reserved liquid from the beans and
simmer several minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in 2 tablespoons
of lime juice.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the remaining clove of garlic in half. Rub the surface of the
halibut with the cut clove. Spray the fish with nonstick cooking
spray and rub the oregano over the surface. Cook the fish on a
well-seasoned grill pan over high heat or an outdoor grill about 5
minutes. Lightly season with salt and turn. Continue grilling until
the fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, about 5 minutes.
Season with salt and remove from the grill. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   For the dressing combine the remaining 1 tablespoon of lime juice,
the lemon juice, water, chopped cilantro, 1/8 teaspoon salt and
pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly spray both sides of the tortillas with nonstick cooking
spray and place in a single layer on baking sheets. Bake until crisp,
8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Spread about 2 tablespoons of the beans on each tortilla. Top each
with 1 cup of romaine.</TE>
<TE>   Flake the fish and divide among the tortillas, placing it on top
of the greens. Drizzle the tostadas with the dressing. Sprinkle
tomatoes over the top of each.</TE>

<LD>A refreshing salad is hard to beat on a summer's night. But sometimes
it seems as if a salad can be, well, a little light. So I like to
make a spinach salad with crisp bacon pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Bacon adds some heft. Try some of the more gourmet types of bacon
found at specialty grocers and upscale supermarkets, such as
applewood-smoked bacon. They're more subtle in flavor with a better
pork taste.</LD>
<LD>   Chopped hard-boiled egg, crumbled feta and avocado also add some
body to this salad. So stay light for dessert--have frozen fruit
bars.</LD>
<TE>   Place mats, napkin, plates and bowl from Pier 1 Import stores.</TE>
<TE>   To toast the almonds, heat a small skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the almonds and cook, shaking the skillet frequently, until
lightly browned, about 2 minutes.</TE>

<HD>A New American Appellation: Rockpile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Tennessee Carter Bishop was a hard man. Back in the 1870s, he
took prisoners from the Sonoma County jail and put them to work
building a road from Dry Creek Valley to his remote mountain ranch.</LD>
<LD>   The sheriff called his ranch the Rock Pile, possibly after
1,751-foot Rockpile Peak nearby, and the road became known as
Rockpile Road. Little did Sheriff Bishop know that in the fullness of
time he would also be naming Sonoma County's 12th American
Viticultural Area.</LD>
<LD>   The new Rockpile AVA was approved on April 29. But its pending
establishment has been well-known in the wine world, and several
wineries already offer a taste of the new appellation. Look for the
word "rockpile" on wine labels from Rosenblum, Seghesio, Carol
Shelton, Gary Galleron, St. Francis, Kenwood, Mauritson and Paradise
Ridge.</LD>
<TE>   The Rockpile AVA is remarkable for several reasons. One is that,
as AVAs go, it's small. At 13,000 total acres, it's the second
smallest in Sonoma County (Sonoma Mountain is 6,000 acres). It's the
smallest in number of growers (11) and acres of vineyards (200).</TE>
<TE>   Small is good on a viticultural map, where the ultimate goal is to
draw lines that correspond to impressions on the palate. The less
geographically specific an AVA is, the less viticultural meaning it
has. Many AVAs, created simply as marketing tools, are too general to
tell the consumer anything about what's in the bottle. A closely
defined AVA is more likely to be truly distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   Just Vines</TE>
<TE>   Another unusual thing is that Rockpile is the only Sonoma County
AVA without any wineries. But then, it doesn't need any--wineries
outside the appellation are clamoring for Rockpile fruit. And in
Northern California, where the typical wine producer purchases well
over half its grapes from independent growers, an all-grower AVA
makes perfect sense.</TE>
<TE>   Why all the interest in Rockpile? In two words, intensity and
structure. Rockpile fruit hits the palate like a laser beam,
perfectly defined but complex. Around the world, mountain-grown fruit
is used for giving extra weight and authority to blended wines. When
those wines are bottled on their own, they can be stunning.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Shelton's Rocky Reserve Zinfandel is a good example. It's a
huge wine by any standard, gushing with flavor, but it's nimble on
the palate--another sip is simply compulsory.</TE>
<TE>   The keys here are altitude and proximity to the ocean. Like most
mountain appellations, Rockpile is largely defined by elevation. All
the vineyards are higher than 800 feet above sea level, and most are
between 1,000 and 2,000 feet. That puts them above the fog level,
where they bask in long, warm days tempered most afternoons by a
brisk wind from the nearby Pacific Ocean. A dramatic drop in
temperature during the night preserves grape acidity.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally for those conditions, the vineyards are almost entirely
in red grapes, mostly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon. The
sea-kissed fruit ripens prodigiously, developing a distinctive
combination of deep color, concentrated flavor, thick tannin and
vibrant acidity. Wines made from those grapes also have distinctive
succulence--the same kind of savory quality expressed by Russian
River Valley Pinot Noirs and Zinfandels, but in a more massive
context. They can show the same kind of muscular elegance as a great
athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Rockpile is new in another way. All of its vineyards have been
planted in the last 10 years, and Rockpile fruit has only been
available in decent quantities since the late 1990s. You could call
it an instant appellation. But it does meet one of the primary
requirements for an AVA: Grapes have historically been grown there.</TE>
<TE>   A survey document from 1872 mentions a bearing vineyard on
Bishop's land. Because grapevines don't usually yield fruit until
their third year, it can be assumed that the vineyard was planted in
the 1860s, possibly right around the time Gen. Robert E. Lee was
cantering old Traveler up the muddy road to Appomattox Court House
back in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bishop's vines fared little better in the long run
than the Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War. You can still
find vine stakes among the oaks and firs on the forested Rockpile
slopes, but the area produced virtually no wine grapes during most of
the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   The current revival began in 1992, when retired UC Berkeley Vice
Chancellor Rod Park and his wife, Cathy, planted vines near their
home on the historic Bishop homestead. The Park vineyard is about
2,000 feet in elevation. It's been known to snow there in late
spring, when the vines are already pushing out new shoots to begin
the growing season.</TE>
<TE>   The Parks planted Cabernet, Merlot and Petite Verdot. Paradise
Ridge Winery produced a wine from each variety in 2001. The Merlot is
particularly outstanding, larger than life with opulent perfume and
flavor, a plush, slightly nubby texture and a chiseled structure.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time the Parks were planting, vintner Kent
Rosenblum collaborated with viticulturist Jack Florence Jr. to plant
Zinfandel on the Florence family property. The bud wood came from an
old Zinfandel vineyard near St. Peter's Church in Cloverdale, one of
the oldest producing vineyards in California; it is thought to have
been planted in Bishop's day.</TE>
<TE>   Solid and Supple</TE>
<TE>   Rosenblum's Rockpile Road Zinfandels are perhaps the
quintessential Rockpile expression in the way they reconcile opposing
forces. The '01, which will be released early next year, is lush yet
as clear as stained glass, with an intense complex of well-defined
flavors. The tannin is thick but supple, and there's a kind of
tenderness in the powerful finish. The Petite Sirah '01 from the same
vineyard shows the same qualities with more black pepper and savory
herb notes.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenblum winemaker Jeff Cohn has an impressive JC Cellars Syrah
'01 from vines planted in 1997 by Jack Florence Sr. It displays the
savory intensity of coastal mountain fruit with a spiciness that
evokes the rocky vineyards of the northern Rhone.</TE>
<TE>   Mick Lumetta planted his five acres of St. Peter's Church
selection Zinfandel in 1995, with about 5% Petite Sirah inter-planted
in the field blend tradition. Like his vines, Lumetta has had to
struggle to get established. He had to halt construction of his house
while a mountain lion gave birth in the cellar. When the baby lions
were old enough to run, California Fish &amp; Game rangers chased the
family off, and construction resumed.</TE>
<TE>   Lumetta has a small business in Santa Rosa, but his heart is in
his vineyard. Growing grapes has been a dream since his childhood in
Michigan, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd go to the Eastern Market in Detroit, and wait for the train
to come in from California so we could buy a ton of grapes to make
wine. My father used to say, 'Someday you'll own vines in
California.' And that was always my goal in life."</TE>
<TE>   Seghesio Vineyards has been buying Lumetta's fruit. It lends
structure, tannin and luminous depth of flavor to the Seghesio
Lumetta Vineyard Zinfandel. But winemaker Ted Seghesio likes the
fruit so much he bottled 24 cases of Lumetta Zin for sale in the
winery tasting room. It's a lovely wine, with the signal combination
of tender berry flavor and robust tannin.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Branham, a Sutter Home winemaker, planted three acres of Zin
in a remote location near the Mendocino County line in 1993. Napa
Valley consulting winemaker Gary Galleron has made several
spectacular wines from the fruit. The '99 Galleron "Branham Vineyard"
Zin has a ravishing perfume and flavor of ripe berries, roses, and
spice over big, smooth tannin. The '01 is a step up in power, yet is
still an elegant wine.</TE>
<TE>   Roughing It</TE>
<TE>   Rockpile is as challenging for people as for grapes. Many
residents are entirely off the grid, with no utilities or
infrastructure, struggling right along with their vines. Rod and
Cathy Park typically run their generator a couple hours during the
day to keep a bank of batteries charged up. The house and the pumps
run off the batteries.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out to be cheaper than PG&amp;E," says Rod Park.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine people living up there before automotive
transportation. Even now, it's a good 40-minute drive to the nearest
store--and it's not much of a store. Back then, going to town for
supplies would have meant two days of rugged travel.</TE>
<TE>   Still, says Cathy Park, "There were more people up here right
after the Gold Rush than there are now."</TE>
<TE>   There may have been a store back in those days. There was a post
office, called Throop--the Parks have an old envelope with a Throop
postmark. Rockpile Road remains the AVA's only road, and only about
half of it is paved.</TE>
<TE>   That's significant. If the area had been more easily settled, with
trophy houses on expensive acreage, it might have become just another
Cabernet-Chardonnay bank, or perhaps vines wouldn't have been
established at all.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, Rockpile is a challenge--still pioneer country.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2000 Domaine Santa Duc Gigondas, Southern Rhone, France</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winemaker Yves Gras is best known for his stunning old-vine Gigondas,
Les Hautes Garrigues, but his regular Gigondas is pretty terrific
too. Made from a blend of 80% Grenache and 20% Mourvedre, it has a
magical, evocative perfume of plums, earth and smoke. It tastes of
raspberries and juicy red plums. Don't worry if you don't get around
to drinking it immediately. This one will age beautifully.</LD>
<LD>   It's perfect with grilled duck breast, pigeon and other game, but
would also show well against a simple roast chicken or beef daube
with olives. Save a little for the cheese course.</LD>
<LD>   Domaine Santa Duc has long been an insider's wine, snatched off
the shelves as soon as it comes into this country. Fortunately, it's
becoming more available.</LD>
<TE>   About $27. Available at Beverage Warehouse in Marina del Rey,

<HD>Time to Transition</HD>
<DH>Jennifer Aniston, wanting out of the comedy pigeonhole,
stretches dormant dramatic muscles in 'The Good Girl'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite having one of the most famous faces in the world, beamed into
100 countries on a daily basis as one of the six stars of the TV show
"Friends," Jennifer Aniston is not always recognizable. Indeed, just
last summer, a little-old-lady resident of Simi Valley was so happy
to discover that the neighborhood's abandoned storefront had been
transformed into a Retail Rodeo--Hollywood's idea of a dingy discount
store--that she marched up to the hunched-over shopgirl at the makeup
counter and tried to buy something.</LD>
<LD>   "She didn't recognize it was Jennifer," says director Miguel
Arteta, who was in the middle of a rehearsal at the time for
Aniston's new film, "The Good Girl," which opens today. "I thought,
'My God, we've got a movie.' "</LD>
<LD>   And why would she recognize TV's Rachel Green, stripped of her
glossy hair, tawny skin and her famously arched brow, her lithe
figure literally slumped into depression as if saddled by 50-pound
weights? Through much of the movie, only her blue-green eyes are
allowed expression, and they flicker nervously back and forth, like
rabbits caught in a trap.</LD>
<TE>   "The Good Girl" is a Wal-Mart rendition of Flaubert's "Madame
Bovary," a comic meditation on the frustrated life. This isn't
Depression with a capital D, the usual Hollywood kind that allows for
epic scenery-chewing and blatant Oscar posturing. This is D for Dairy
Queen, Domino's pizza and dead-end jobs. Aniston plays Justine, a
clerk in a Texas variety store, caught between her mind-numbing days
and her lumpen nights with her sweet-natured house-painter husband
(John C. Reilly) and his best friend (Tim Blake Nelson), both usually
stoned out of their minds by the time she arrives home. Her one bid
for passion involves a fellow clerk (Jake Gyllenhaal), an unstable
college dropout, a decade younger, who's re-christened himself
"Holden" after Salinger's restless hero.</TE>
<TE>   This world of diminished expectations suits Aniston, a deft
comedian who, unlike many performers, manages to be not only wry but
also humble. Her Justine knows that the sound of her heart breaking
is not an orchestra, but the forlorn din of wind chimes on a hot
Texas night.</TE>
<TE>   On a hot Los Angeles morning last week, Aniston admits that this
quintessential indie role was the answer to her prayers--literally.
Just two weeks before Mike White's script arrived in her dressing
room at "Friends," she'd been "praying for something to manifest."</TE>
<TE>   After nine seasons on "Friends," and a sputtered movie career that
includes such forgettable films as "Friends" wannabe "Picture
Perfect," she was, well ... a wee bit bored.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I couldn't just keep doing this. I don't want to be kept
in this little slot," she says, looking more like herself, in cream
painter pants, a tank top, her hair slung back and no makeup. "Not to
put down the romantic comedy. Just after a while it gets a little
monotonous. You feel like you're reading the same thing with the same
formula with a different backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this for so many years on this show. People know
who I am but they don't really trust me to do the other.... Then
Miguel Arteta comes along who thinks it will be interesting to mess
that up a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Arteta and White's first collaboration, "Chuck &amp; Buck," was a
comically creepy riff on "Fatal Attraction," about a man arrested in
some adolescent developmental stage and obsessed with his best friend
from childhood. They specialize in ordinary lives, indeed alienated
folks, whose worlds are enlivened--and rocked--by the force of their
fantasies. Released by Fox Searchlight, "The Good Girl" cost less
than $10 million, less than half what Aniston earns for a season of
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Arteta says that he and White considered a whole host of usual
indie suspects for the part but weren't excited about the prospects
until White finally suggested Aniston. "Something about the humor she
had even in her TV show, it's very approachable and very relatable.
It feels somehow grounded," says Arteta.</TE>
<TE>   At Home With Brad Pitt</TE>
<TE>   As she sits at home by her pool, Aniston does feel relatable; she
fiddles with the straps of her tank top, shuffles Norman, a sweet
sheepdog mutt, out of the way, talks with her hands like her
character Rachel on TV and pours Splenda into her coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "The new fake sugar," she says ironically. "It's not a
carcinogenic. Brad was saying, 'You have to stop with the Sweet'n
Lows.' I have to have it so sweet, the amount of sugar I'd put in
there!" Puzzled by what she's actually slipping into her drink, she
reads the ingredients. "It's sucrose ... no, sucralose. It's got to
be fake something."</TE>
<TE>   For those who have managed to avoid People magazine, or TV's
"Entertainment Tonight" or any of the numerous outlets of the
celebrity machine, Brad is Brad Pitt, Aniston's husband of two years.
The pair are usually credited with living in a French-Normandy-style
mansion in Beverly Hills, although in fact they still live here, in a
small (tiny by movie-star standards) two-bedroom house in the
Hollywood Hills, bought by Aniston in the blush of her first
"Friends" success. The pool is not much bigger than a wading pool,
and the house--what can be seen of it--is a cozy stew of wood and
books and light.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a mess," says Aniston. "That's why I'm embarrassed to
walk you through. We're so cramped, we're falling out of it...."
Still, the house, which looked "like a public school" when she bought
it, is full of sentimental feelings for Aniston. "It's going to kill
me to leave ... this house has been so good to me." They've spent the
last year fixing up their new Old World-style home, a renovation that
seems to be requiring a certain amount of mediation between Pitt's
modernist aesthetic and Aniston's more cozy one. "We have those
knockdown-drag-outs once in a while," she says with a laugh. The
resulting home is "eclectic ... with bits of modern furniture mixed
in."</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I think it's taken us this long is because
symbolically we're establishing and creating the foundation. Watch
... we'll never leave one room. We don't need space. We just need
bedrooms for people to visit!"</TE>
<TE>   It's hard not to get the feeling that Aniston's life is going into
another big transition, with the probable end of "Friends" next year.
"I'm sad. Every time I talk about it or think about that moving on, I
get choked up," she says, "but it's time. It's time." At a recent
junket for the film "The Good Girl," almost every journalist asked if
she was worried she wouldn't work after the show ended, a thought
that hadn't crossed her mind. "Hopefully I will survive," she says.
"But there is the possibility, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   The brewing word on "The Good Girl" has already begun to change
her career options and last week landed her the biggest film role of
her life, opposite Jim Carrey in the upcoming comedy "Bruce
Almighty." When she took on "The Good Girl," shot in her off days
from "Friends," she asked Arteta, "Please keep watch over me and
don't let me do anything that you've seen before."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't let her.</TE>
<TE>   "By the third day, I was ready to strangle him," says Aniston. "I
was frustrated. It was muscles being exercised that have been asleep
for years. And it was scary. I found myself crying all the time. He
pushed me into uncomfortable places. I didn't realize how
uncomfortable I was with experiencing depression or being sad."
Indeed, the sadness in her life she's usually tried to extinguish
with comedy, her greatest survival skill.</TE>
<TE>   Mediator for Her Parents</TE>
<TE>   While to millions of fans Aniston's life seems the embodiment of
the American Dream, she says it wasn't always so. Born in the San
Fernando Valley, Aniston saw her parents divorce when she was 9, and
she moved to New York's Upper West Side with her mother Nancy. At 11,
she knew she was going to be an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all I could do," she says. "I didn't have confidence in
myself that I could do much more." Both parents were also actors, her
father successfully on a soap opera, her mother much less so. "She
was a terrible actress. She'd be the first to tell you that. She
couldn't handle the rejection." Aniston doesn't usually speak about
her mother, because the pair are famously estranged, after her mother
wrote a tell-all book about her famous daughter. But her spirit does
seem to hover over "The Good Girl."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bounty of her present-day life, Aniston says she
related to Justine. "I feel so much like that person sometimes.
That's what's so interesting." She begins to riff again, slowly,
without the familiar self-deprecating inflections. "That boredom I
can understand. My childhood was depressed and sad; not to say my
home was like a prison, but there was an element that was confining
and sad."</TE>
<TE>   Justine, she adds, "reminded me a lot of my mom. Here was a woman
who was born into a different generation that didn't have
opportunities that we women have, even the self-help books or
therapy. When the divorce happened there wasn't a lot she could do."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout her childhood, Aniston was always trying to be the
"good girl," mediating her parents' hostility, and like Justine
"sometimes lying about things to not hurt Mom and then lying about
things to not hurt Dad and getting myself in trouble and not
realizing that the truth is the most beautiful version of love, no
matter how painful it is. We can be in conflict and you're not going
to go away. You're not going to disappear, which I think is what I
always felt."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time for Aniston to disappear. In 25 minutes, she's
taking a plane to Toronto, the first leg of her cross-country press
tour. This is a rare feat for Aniston, who's not only never been to
Canada but barely traveled because she's afraid of flying. "I have to
get over that to see the world," she says. "I've been so riddled with
fear. If there was ever a moment when I was maybe going to go, I got
out of it. I've gone to hypnotists, everything. I once took an
anti-anxiety pill. I still felt anxiety. I just didn't have the
energy to act it out."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to keep the comedy away, she riffs humorously--suddenly
more Rachel than Justine. "It's like this thing I watched on the
Learning Channel, 'Trauma Center.' My guilty pleasure--me and my
husband watch these things like 'When Animals Attack' or 'Real World'
or 'Good Times Gone Bad.' There was this one called 'Trapped in a
Body,' and it was about surgery where [the patients] didn't go
completely under. [The doctors] could cut into them and they wouldn't
scream, but they could hear it and feel it. It was awful."</TE>

<HD>Dylan's Disguise Keeps Fans Guessing at Newport Festival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1965, the talk of the Newport Folk Festival was Bob Dylan plugging
in. In 2002, the crowd conversation was about the rock troubadour
wigging out.</LD>
<LD>   The 1960s icon inspired head-scratching and studied speculation
among his fans on Saturday when he made a triumphant return to the
famous festival in a get-up that seemed like one of Dana Carvey's
castoffs from "The Master of Disguise." The western wear and white
cowboy hat were fine, but what was up with the long, stringy wig and
fake beard?</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing I can tell you," one of Dylan's confidants said
Tuesday, refusing to even confirm that it was fake hair. When asked
if Dylan had the brown, shoulder-length locks the night before the
show, the longtime associate laughed and said, "No, he didn't."</LD>
<TE>   Entire bookshelves are devoted to the cryptic Dylan's art and
mind, so it's no surprise that fan Web sites have been buzzing with
speculation about why the master songwriter sought, as the Boston
Globe described it, "a Hasidic cowboy look." Some thought Dylan was
deflating the hype built up over his Newport return; others guessed
it was a preview of his look in the film "Masked &amp; Anonymous."</TE>
<TE>   "No, he's done with the principal photography on the movie; this
didn't have anything to do with that," said the Dylan associate, who
asked not to be identified. "Beyond that, there's not a lot I can
tell you."</TE>

<KH>An Appreciation</KH>
<HD>Hearn Still Had Game in an Age Without It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a lie to say, as many no doubt will, that age never caught up
with Chick Hearn. Anyone who watched Laker games these past few years
and heard sidekick Stu Lantz subtly correct Chick when he confused
Kobe Bryant with Rick Fox or Robert Horry knows his game had lost a
step, in the same way an aging point guard's does.</LD>
<LD>   Still, TV viewers and radio listeners seemed willing to cut Hearn
considerable slack, for reasons that included what he represented,
what he had been and, perhaps most important in light of the current
marriage of sports and media, what he wasn't.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn had an act, to be sure, a collection of catchphrases and
colloquialisms that will probably never be equaled in sports. From
faking someone "into the popcorn machine" to a dribbler "yo-yoing up
and down" to an uncalled foul being "no harm, no foul, no ambulance,"
he peppered his play-by-play with witticisms meant to entertain every
bit as much as they painted what he liked to call his "words-eye
view."</LD>
<TE>   Foremost, however, Hearn's genuine passion for the game shined
through, in stark contrast to the current breed of sportscasters, who
too often sound as if their broadcasts are little more than auditions
for thinly veiled ambitions to replace Letterman or Leno.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, you see, it was decided in TV sports circles that
the action itself isn't entertainment enough. There were untold games
to be found on cable, after all, and everyone has access to the same
clips and highlights. Couple that with Craig Kilborn's graduation
from ESPN sports anchor to late-night funny man, and the prevailing
wisdom has become that the actual play is secondary--a setup, in
essence, for a series of elaborate (and usually forced) punch lines.</TE>
<TE>   Sportscasters were thus transformed into entertainers, from the
nightly "Can you top this?" exchange of one-liners on ESPN and Fox
Sports West's recap shows to the blustering bombast of basketball
commentators such as Dick Vitale and Bill Raftery, whose shrieks and
squawks and fabricated excitement--if briefly amusing at
first--quickly make any true sports fan wince and reach for the
"mute" button.</TE>
<TE>   Even John Madden--charming initially with his grunts, sound
effects and preoccupation with muddy, over-sized linemen--gradually
slipped into self-parody, an excess made all the more glaring by
younger football commentators who chimed in with their own
"Batman"-derived "Wham! Boom! Pow!" exclamations.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, fortunately, was ever true of Hearn. Yes, he was a
character, but even in his wackiest, zaniest, most absurd bouts of
stressing-out-three-months-before-the-playoffs-because-the-Lakers-are
-losing-in-the-third-quarter-to-Cleveland hysterics, he never fell
into this trap; rather, he watched and called the game with the sort
of enthusiasm and seriousness any fan could appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, Hearn could do this and still dabble in all sorts of
silliness, from delivering shameless plugs for various sponsors
("Don't miss the Boat ... Show!") to his hilariously abrupt exchanges
with those calling the Laker pregame show to his blatant
homerism--that is, his unabashed rooting for the home team, though
they weren't spared his criticism when playing poorly. Somehow, Hearn
maintained an integrity that made his play-by-play credible despite
being heavily interspersed with "this reporter's o-pinion," as he
liked to say.</TE>
<TE>   A main reason Hearn evaded such pitfalls is that he and others
from the generation that preceded the ubiquitousness of
cable--including the Dodgers' Vin Scully--learned by necessity to
communicate in a way modern sportscasters haven't. Hearn really did
paint a verbal picture moving left to right across your radio dial
(whatever that meant), managing not only to call all the action but
also to seamlessly toss in criticism and commentary ("Fisher throws a
horrible pass!") along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Compare that to virtually any of the newer breed of broadcasters,
which for the purpose of this discussion describes anyone from Brent
Musburger forward. Just try closing your eyes and following what's
happening for a few moments listening to these blowhards. Sure,
you'll hear lots of strung-together bursts of terminology ("In the
paint," "On the box," "Screen-roll"), but you can go minutes without
stumbling upon anything that approaches a complete sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tide flowing in this direction, Hearn remained beloved
by Laker fans young and old. Part of that, certainly, had to do with
his strong link to and obvious affection for the team, but the
affinity went beyond that. As un-hip and crotchety as he steadfastly
was in his later years, Hearn never lost a connection with the
audience and city that transcended age, ethnicity, gender and social
class.</TE>
<TE>   For local fans, somehow, this elderly man was the voice of their
team, every bit as symbolic as the "Forum Blue" jerseys and blare of
Randy Newman's anthem "I Love L.A." In that context, it's no wonder
that Hearn's death was treated on local television Monday with the
kind of wall-to-wall coverage and reverence normally reserved for
heads of state, because in Los Angeles, at least, that's pretty much
what he was--the audio track for a franchise that serves as one of
the few adhesives holding a far-flung city together.</TE>
<TE>   The news of Hearn's passing thus was felt on myriad levels. As a
lifeline to a time when every game wasn't televised, he bridged the
gap between that past and the present. Yet he also managed to speak
to one of the world's most diverse cities--about players who weren't
born when his career began--in a language all his own.</TE>
<TE>   So put this one on a shelf in the refrigerator right next to the
jello that's jigglin', because after the mixture of ingredients that
produced Chick Hearn, television went out and broke the mold.</TE>

<HD>He Woos Fans in Two Languages</HD>
<DH>Marc Anthony is trying to expand his audience base by
singing in Spanish and English. Is it working?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marc Anthony was in a frisky mood Monday, opening a two-night stand
at the Greek Theatre. The skinny singer skipped across the stage like
a happy-go-lucky kid in pale blue jeans, even acting giddy at times.
Between songs, he bounced in place like a jumping jack, turned
pirouettes and did a little soft shoe.</LD>
<LD>   His relentlessly upbeat performance may have surprised those
expecting more introspection from the avowed family man who
reportedly just split from his wife of two years. The popular Puerto
Rican singer showed not a shred of genuine heartbreak during an
energetic 85-minute set that included tear-jerkers in two languages.</LD>
<LD>   He seemed to hurry through his saddest songs. Technically, his
delivery was exquisite on his romantic salsa smash "Hasta Que Te
Conoci" (Until I Met You), a yearning Juan Gabriel tune that builds
rhythmically and emotionally in swirls around the singer's mournful
moaning.</LD>
<TE>   But the song ended abruptly, and maybe a minute too soon. That was
immediately followed by "She Mends Me," from his latest
English-language album, "Mended." Despite its despondent lyrics, Marc
Anthony giggled at the end in one of his frequent friendly exchanges
with ecstatic fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Feel the love in the air," urged the singer, who wore dark
glasses throughout the show.</TE>
<TE>   Those seated close to the front may have gleaned a reason for the
artist's soaring spirit. The devoted father occasionally blew kisses
toward his young son, spotted off-stage in the arms of his supposedly
estranged wife.</TE>
<TE>   Whether their presence signaled a reconciliation or not (his
publicist had no comment), Marc Anthony still stands at a crossroads
in his career. As one of the so-called crossover stars in Latin
music, he has tried to woo fans in two languages, with recent albums
of different material in Spanish and English.</TE>
<TE>   That's not easy, as evidenced by Monday's near-capacity audience,
which was overwhelmingly Latino.</TE>
<TE>   His new English album was panned by critics and has failed to
yield a hit with the breakthrough power of 1999's edgy "I Need to
Know," offered Monday in a faster and less effective version as an
encore. More indicative of trouble may be the fact that he chose only
one song from the new salsa album, "Libre." That number, "Celos"
(Jealousy), could easily have been excluded without hurting the
program or leaving fans feeling cheated.</TE>
<TE>   This forgettable salsa album was marred by a dispute with
songwriters when the singer made an unusual demand for shared credits
for his improvisational vocals. But for someone so interested in
composer's rights, it's odd that Marc Anthony doesn't acknowledge on
stage the songwriters who played such a strong role in making him a
superstar.</TE>
<TE>   His concert would seem incomplete without that vintage gem by
Mexico's Gabriel. And the singer himself introduced another of his
salsa hits, 1995's "Nadie Como Ella" (Nobody Like Her), as "the Super
Bowl of salsa songs." Though a vast exaggeration, he could have cited
composer Omar Alfanno, who must be the MVP of salsa songwriters.</TE>
<TE>   There's one thing for which Marc Anthony deserves unqualified
credit: being a most natural exponent of bicultural pop music. On
stage, he makes his reggae version of the Eagles' "Hotel California"
fit seamlessly with salsa standards and pop ballads.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for this talented vocalist is to keep finding great
songs to fuel both sides of his career. For that, he needs writers
more than they need him.</TE>

<HD>A Historic Guide to Style Over Substance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take it as a given that all TV networks do what they can to reach
younger viewers. Yet the elevation of style over substance reaches a
level of absurdity best described by the one-word names given
perfumes--Obsession? Myopia?--when it demands sifting the sands of
history through an MTV-filtered prism.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the document the History Channel distributed to producers
last month, which at first glance read as if someone from "Saturday
Night Live" must have written it. Apparently concerned that
channel-surfers are put off by seeing tweedy graybeards discussing
World War II or the Aztecs, the network issued "visual and editorial"
guidelines urging filmmakers to "give younger experts a chance on
camera.... This country is filled with younger historians dying to
get a chance to strut their stuff. Don't rely on old faithfuls.... We
are depending on you to find the best storyteller; he or she doesn't
have to be the leading academic on the topic."</LD>
<LD>   Just to make clear it wasn't a joke, the channel stressed that if
these parameters aren't followed, "we will request additional
shooting. We hope this notice calls attention to our seriousness."</LD>
<TE>   Seriousness about the policy mandate, yes. Seriousness about
history? OK, as long as it appeals to adults under 50 with plenty of
disposable income.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, youth is only one aspect of the channel's criteria for
who gets admitted to the expert club--the sort of idiotic knee-jerk
push hardly confined to the History Channel, by the way, but rather
illustrative of TV's general requirements for enrollment in the
talking-head class, which often have less to do with what's being
said than who's saying it.</TE>
<TE>   Another provision of the updated standards, for example, suggests
that ugly historians need not apply, either. "The person has to be
telegenic, well groomed and dressed properly to reflect the mood of
the program," the guidelines note, pressing for interview locations
to be "active and exciting. Put them outside if that makes sense ...
in a setting that is relevant to the topic. If they can walk and
talk, great."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say that the channel is rigid about its mandate to
be young, bold and ambulatory. "Exceptions are certainly accepted for
eyewitnesses and/or participants in the events you're producing the
program about," the memo states. In other words, producers need not
find a 35-year-old World War II veteran to interview, though one
suspects that if any existed, it would be considered a bonus.</TE>
<TE>   One producer who has worked for the channel--and asked to be kept
anonymous, to keep alive the possibility of working there
again--chalked up the correspondence to advertising's influence on
programming decisions, saying with resignation, "Madison Avenue is
driving the television world absolutely mad."</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, pressure to attract the audience media buyers covet
inspires the media to put the cart before the horse--or better yet,
trample the horse in pursuit of the demographic that rides
skateboards and mopeds.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the History Channel--one of the A&amp;E networks, a
joint venture of Hearst Corp., ABC and NBC, companies that presumably
know something about news--stressed that the style guide merely
represents a means of exerting quality control over productions. The
goal is to recognize demands of a visual medium, they say, insisting
that they can do so without compromising content.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created an environment where history can be fun and
engaging ... without ever losing our quality or integrity," said
History Channel Executive Vice President/General Manager Abbe Raven.</TE>
<TE>   The channel seeks experts with impeccable credentials, Raven
added, and draws on a variety of sources--not all of them used on
camera--to ensure accuracy. That said, she acknowledged a desire to
make programs as accessible as possible and "find, and groom, that
next generation of historians."</TE>
<TE>   Although she took exception to being lumped in with TV news ("We
are nowhere in the same camp as what the news networks are doing"),
Raven also expressed enthusiasm about exploring new avenues to get
people excited about history--such as having last week's travel
series "Hit the Road" hosted by Jason Sehorn, a pro football star
known for pounding wide receivers, not hitting the books.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to lump the guidelines in with other blatant examples of
entertainment industry ageism, an issue raised again in what amounted
to a made-for-TV press conference last week.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, however, what's most stunning about the
rules--and the muddled logic behind them--is their sheer inanity.</TE>
<TE>   After all, if I'm clamoring to watch something hot, young and sexy
at that moment, the History Channel isn't going to be my first stop,
unless the experts can compete with whatever's on Cinemax.
Conversely, if I want to learn about the Hindenburg or just find out
if the Dodgers won, whether the historian or sportscaster has
washboard abs, perfect hair or full, luscious lips won't make me more
inclined to stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, if the top expert in the field is available, and I care
enough about the topic at hand to watch, then call me wacky, but
that's who I want to hear from, not Conan the Historian.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, it's understood that television is driven by pictures and
most of us, fairly or not, would rather watch beautiful people than
unattractive ones--whether the task is delivering news or
pontificating about ancient Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder luminaries within the pundit ranks--such as Ann Coulter,
who became a fixture on ABC's since-defunct "Politically Incorrect
With Bill Maher" by mixing conservative politics with short
skirts--seemingly ascend based as much on their looks as on political
insights.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most disconcerting about this is the sense that the few
havens left where packaging doesn't trump the actual product might be
disappearing. Can't there be a couple of channels where knowing
something most people don't matters most, and where looks aren't the
be-all and end-all? I mean, if the History Channel feels it has to
resemble E!'s "Wild On" to compete for ad dollars, I give up.</TE>
<TE>   It might even be time--dare I say it?--to crack open a book.</TE>

<LD>   Roberts Being Treated for Breast Cancer</LD>
<LD>   ABC News veteran Cokie Roberts, 58, had a lumpectomy for a small
malignant tumor in her left breast at Washington's Sibley Hospital
two weeks ago. It wasn't until after she announced her departure from
"This Week," the Sunday news show she co-anchored with Sam Donaldson,
that the journalist was diagnosed with the disease, the Washington
Post reports.</LD>
<TE>   A longtime breast cancer activist and proponent of mammograms,
Roberts said she's in touch with the irony of the situation. But the
prognosis is good, she says, because of early detection. Six months
of chemotherapy, beginning this week, aren't expected to interfere
with her ability to cover the mid-term elections. Roberts, the mother
of two and grandmother of three, is no newcomer to adversity. Her
father, then-House Majority Leader Hale Boggs (D-La.), died in a
plane crash in 1972, and her sister, Princeton, N.J., Mayor Barbara
Boggs Sigmund, died of malignant melanoma in 1990.</TE>

<TE>   Anna Nicole Smith Scores in Debut</TE>
<TE>   The first episode of "The Anna Nicole Show," which was shown
Sunday at 10 p.m. on E! Entertainment Television, drew 4.1 million
viewers, more than seven times the audience E! normally draws in that
half hour.</TE>
<TE>   The show features Anna Nicole Smith, the former Guess? Jeans model
and Playboy centerfold, in an unscripted format much like "The
Osbournes," the MTV series about rocker Ozzy Osbourne and family. So
far, however, critics have not embraced the buxom Smith as a TV
character, criticizing E! for exploiting her and turning her into an
object of ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   For the week ending Aug. 4, "The Anna Nicole Show" was the
sixth-most-watched show on cable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Monk' Will Migrate From USA to ABC</TE>
<TE>   Continuing a new trend in which major networks sift through cable
lineups looking for low-cost summer programs, ABC has agreed to
repeat the USA network series "Monk"--a new drama starring Tony
Shalhoub--on Tuesday nights the next four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is getting rights to the show at a reduced fee, since the
broadcasts will follow initial showings on USA.</TE>
<TE>   Major networks have been repeating their offerings on cable for
some time, but only recently has the equation begun to flow in the
opposite direction. NBC struck an agreement in July to run the Court
TV series "Forensic Files" on four consecutive Sundays beginning
later this month.</TE>

<TE>   Local Emmy Telecast Includes Hearn Honors</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences' 54th annual Los Angeles
Area Emmy Awards, at which Chick Hearn was honored, will be shown
Sunday at 1:30 a.m. on KCBS-TV Channel 2. The June 29 event may have
marked the Lakers announcer's last major public appearance. He died
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   President Bryce Zabel said that Hearn was gracious and touching in
accepting the L.A. Area Governors Award. The broadcasting legend told
the audience that his mantra was to "be honest and tell it like it
is."</TE>

<TE>   Miami Shoot Triggers Angry Reaction</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood filmmakers shooting the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence movie
"Bad Boys 2" haven't made any friends in Florida this week. Closing
down the MacArthur Causeway, the main road between downtown Miami and
Miami Beach, for a scene has residents fuming.</TE>
<TE>   A typical 15-minute commute between the city and the island
stretched to more than an hour, and cars overheated in the 90 degree
heat. In return for such inconveniences, local authorities are
receiving an infusion of $20 million from the shoot into the local
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently those charged with governing and managing the city are
so blinded by dollar signs and Hollywood lights that they cannot see
how unconscionable it is to close the MacArthur Causeway for four
days," resident Robin Statfeld writes in a letter to the Miami
Herald.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said that Columbia Pictures is spending about
$500,000 to cover the costs of the closure--including the hiring of
police officers to redirect traffic.</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Holden Play Replacing 'Homebody/Kabul'</TE>
<TE>   The Mark Taper Forum will present Joan Holden's new play "Nickel
and Dimed" as a replacement for its previously announced season
opener, "Homebody/Kabul."</TE>
<TE>   Holden's play, which opened Aug. 2 at the Intiman Theatre in
Seattle, is based on social essayist Barbara Ehrenreich's bestseller
"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting by in America." The book examines
the lives of the working poor, recounting the author's experiences as
a waitress, maid and sales clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Holden served for 30 years as principal playwright for the Tony
Award-winning San Francisco Mime Troupe.</TE>
<TE>   "Nickel and Dimed," which will be directed by Bartlett Sher, will
open on Sept. 19. "Homebody/Kabul," by Pulitzer Prize-winning
playwright Tony Kushner, will be the opening production of the
2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   *UICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Showtime has given a green light to "Crown Heights," an original
movie based on the 1991 race riots in Brooklyn that erupted when a
black child was killed in a car accident. Jeremy Kagan is directing
the project, which stars Mario Van Peebles and Howie Mandel.... The
American Ballet Theatre will present the world premiere of "A Tribute
to George Harrison," featuring choreography set to music by the late
Beatle. Six performances will take place in October at New York's
City Center.</TE>

<HD>Kids' Lives at Heart of 'ICU' Stories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ABC lifted the documentary genre several notches this summer with its
standout series "Houston Medical," and tonight at 10, there's more of
the same excellence at work from the network.</LD>
<LD>   "ICU" delivers a specialized take on the broader medical realities
of the previous series, which took viewers inside the day-to-day
dramas unfolding at a large Texas hospital. Tonight's program, the
first of four linked parts, is set in the cardiac Intensive Care Unit
of Arkansas Children's Hospital, where desperately ill kids and their
families come hoping that they will still have a future together.</LD>
<LD>   The cases examined teeter precariously on the patients' need for
heart transplants, and the nail-biting wait to locate a suitable
donor organ. Add to the mix a colorful crew of medical
miracle-workers, led by triathlete and surgeon extraordinaire Dr.
Jonathan Drummond-Webb, and you have all the ingredients for
compelling TV.</LD>
<TE>   But executive producer David Doss and his staff leave nothing to
chance, pumping up the energy and tension at every turn with
split-screen storytelling, hand-held camerawork and even a jazzy,
propulsive score. The doctors and nurses are introduced at the top of
the show with such show-bizzy razzle-dazzle that you'd think you were
settling in to watch "ER."</TE>
<TE>   But that's part of the savviness behind these ABC documentaries;
they're built with such an eye to entertain, even as they inform,
that you almost forget your favorite weekly drama is on hiatus for
the summer.</TE>
<TE>   ABC News' Elizabeth Vargas narrates the stories behind the tiny
patients and the people who treat them, helped along by onscreen
graphics that dispense statistics and keep viewers breathlessly
abreast of patient status: "The moment of truth--will Keegan's heart
pump on its own?"</TE>
<TE>   But aside from all the technical and creative wizardry, it's the
simplest moments that will stay with you. The shots of the tiny
bodies lying helplessly on huge metal gurneys, their chests heaving
up and down; the married couple, both just 18, holding each other in
the waiting room while their infant battles for life.</TE>
<TE>   Or when a teen looks up from her hospital bed, fixes her teary
eyes on the doctor and whispers, "Please don't let me die."</TE>
<TE>   "Reality" television doesn't get any more real than that.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: Dr. Drummond-Webb finds himself with a different
perspective on a medical crisis. As operating room nurse manager Jean
Ann Phillips puts it: "Medicine is scary; you're never in control of
anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>A Life of Quiet Desperation</HD>
<DH>In the compassionate and keenly observed 'The Good Girl,'
Jennifer Aniston endures life in a dreary West Texas town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Good Girl," one of the year's best films, opens with its
heroine, Justine Last, telling us that "as a little girl you see the
world like a giant candy store, but one day you look around and see a
prison."</LD>
<LD>   Prison for 30-year-old Justine (Jennifer Aniston) is the Retail
Rodeo, a roadside chain department store in a small West Texas town.
Justine has been a cashier there for longer than she cares to
remember, and at the end of her workday, home is a tract house.
There, she inevitably finds her house-painter husband, Phil (John C.
Reilly), and his partner and best pal, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson),
sitting around getting stoned.</LD>
<LD>   On this particular day, the guys, still in their work clothes,
have gotten paint all over the new couch. Phil is a sweet-natured,
big teddy bear of a man, but to Justine, who bypassed college for
fear of losing him, he has become "a pig who talks but doesn't
think."</LD>
<TE>   In short, Justine is living a life of classically quiet
desperation. She has the curse of being more intelligent than
everyone around her. She also has a sure sense of right and wrong,
but her drab existence and the unreflective people who encircle her
are driving her nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Then her gaze lands on a new cashier (Jake Gyllenhaal), a brooding
young man who keeps to himself and calls himself Holden in honor of
the hero of J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye." A substance-abusing
college dropout, he fancies himself a writer and soon declares that
he and she, as outsiders, "get" each other. Before one can say
"Madame Bovary," Justine, feeling that Holden could represent her
last chance to experience passion, decides to throw caution to the
winds.</TE>
<TE>   "The Good Girl" marks the second dazzling teaming of director
Miguel Arteta and actor-writer Mike White. Their previous outing,
"Chuck &amp; Buck," was also darkly venturesome. This film, which is
about how the relentless dullness of the ordinary can grind a person
down, has a corrosive, comically satirical tone yet never condescends
to its people, who are all the more soul-shriveling for being so
real.</TE>
<TE>   At work, Justine has to put up with a relentlessly upbeat
cosmetics sales clerk, Gwen (Deborah Rush); nerdy, super-religious
security guard Corny (White), who is forever trying to get her to
attend Wednesday evening Bible study; and Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel),
who is as unthinking as the others but at least has enough
imagination to relieve her boredom by testing the customers'
self-absorption with inserted obscenities in PA system announcements.
The tall, beefy store manager (John Carroll Lynch) is a master of
cliched slogans and sentiments. These people are not mere caricatures
but recognizably human, which is what sets the filmmakers and their
film way above the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   What sets Justine apart, beyond her intelligence and conscience,
is her moral imagination, which is about to be put to the test. Yet
the filmmakers, having created a classically taut and spare
tragicomedy, dare to leave us with a ray of hope for change and
renewal.</TE>
<TE>   White and Arteta are breathtakingly aware of how people talk and
behave, yet the hilarious absurdity of so much of what they observe
refreshingly inspires in them compassion rather than contempt. While
Arteta directs with a relaxed grace, White comes up with one
painfully funny line after another, some laugh-out-loud funny, others
more ironic or reflective. (When a co-worker wishes Corny a happy
Halloween, he replies with an amiable piousness, "I'm not a pagan
myself, but thank you anyway.")</TE>
<TE>   A rigorously controlled tone is everything in a film with so
delicate a balance between the comic and the serious, and
cinematographer Enrique Chediak and production designer Daniel
Bradford capture consistently the overwhelming, suffocating dullness
of Justine's relentlessly generic environment.</TE>
<TE>   The extraordinary quality of White's script and Arteta's direction
lifts the meticulously cast actors to the height of their abilities.
"Friends" star Aniston digs deep but is never showy. Reilly reveals
the tenderness, vulnerability and hidden depth that can lurk within a
slob, and Nelson has some of the film's most outrageously funny and
inspired moments as a small-minded, despairing man whose unexpected
opportunity to apply a fierce, narrow logic brings him a
long-cherished dividend. Gyllenhaal deftly reveals that with his
weirdo Holden, hapless Justine has ultimately exchanged one basically
clueless male for another.</TE>
<TE>   As long as films like "The Good Girl" can get made, there remains
hope for an original and distinctive American cinema.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sexuality, some language and drug content.
Times guidelines: blunt talk, adult themes and situations.</TE>

<HD>Jury System Gets Favorable Verdict</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To celebrate its 10th anniversary, the A&amp;E network's "American
Justice" puts the jury system on trial. Like jury duty itself, the
two-hour program, "We, the Jury" (tonight at 9), can be tedious--but
also rewarding for those who pay attention.</LD>
<LD>   Host Bill Kurtis looks back at a tumultuous decade in U.S.
justice. Controversial outcomes involving O.J. Simpson, the Menendez
brothers and other famous cases have raised questions about whether
today's juries are up to the task or a relic from simpler times.</LD>
<LD>   Experts and former jurors weigh in, but oddly, one case that
helped spark this debate, the first trial of four police officers in
the Rodney King beating, gets barely a mention. Many of the show's
supposed insights sound familiar--for instance, juror demographics
can be pivotal to the verdict.</LD>
<TE>   But some of the juror interviews might bolster your faith in the
system. The trial of Dana Ewell, accused of slaying his wealthy
Fresno family, hinged on a complex timeline that was presented out of
sequence. Foreman Mike Elder avoided an early vote, following a hunch
that fostered deliberations rather than committing anyone to a public
stance. Jurors rebuilt the timeline in chronological order. After 11
days, Ewell and his co-defendant were convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The jury system's ultimate acquittal comes as no shock. As author
Valerie Hans says, "Most of the time, juries get it right."</TE>
<TE>   Kurtis also says the system is being improved. Seeking more
participation and more diverse panels, states are shifting to the
one-day-or-one-trial format and granting fewer exemptions. Some
judges are even speaking to juries in plain English instead of
legalese.</TE>
<TE>   If all this sounds like slow going, take a cue from the jury
waiting room and bring a book, just in case.</TE>

<HD>Mission Accomplished, Yet Again</HD>
<DH>Though 'Spy Kids 2' has a touch of sequel-itis, it is still
imaginative, smart and stands on its own.</DH>

<LD>Robert Rodriguez is more than in touch with his inner child, he's
involved in a lucrative partnership with the little fellow. Following
the disarmingly clever and successful "Spy Kids" with a sequel, "Spy
Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams," that's almost as good, he's
proving himself to be perhaps the most gifted maker of live-action
family adventure films around.</LD>
<LD>   This was not necessarily predictable from Rodriguez's earlier
films, the violence-laden "El Mariachi" (1992) and "Desperado" (1995)
and the over-the-top vampire biker movie "From Dusk Till Dawn"
(1996). On the other hand, Rodriguez's sensibility in those films was
always that of a big kid just fooling around, and with the "Spy Kids"
movies he's given in to the inevitable and had the time of his life.</LD>
<LD>   While some filmmakers are proud to be one-man bands, Rodriguez is
more like a single-person orchestra. When he calls "Spy Kids 2" "a
Robert Rodriguez movie," he's not hogging recognition. If you add in
the three songs he co-wrote, the credits list him more than a dozen
times, ranging from the predictable writer/director/producer and
director of photography to the more arcane production
designer/editor/sound designer/rerecording mixer and visual effects
supervisor. It's not surprising that he says he doesn't like to
sleep.</LD>
<TE>   What all this has done is give "Spy Kids 2" a consistent
sensibility. Though it's longer and more elaborate than it needs to
be, it shares its predecessor's smart but relaxed sense of humor, a
sophisticated imagination and the ability to be sharp and playful
without being malicious. It may have the occasional camel poop joke,
but it neither descends to lowest-common-denominator humor--a welcome
respite from other summer films--nor treats its kid protagonists with
anything less than complete respect.</TE>
<TE>   "Spy Kids 2" has also continued the first film's tradition of
coming up with wacky gadgets for its secret agents to use. There are
watches that do so much there's no room for them to tell time, a
bug-eyed Dragon Spy submarine, and the irresistible R.A.L.P.H., a
bug-sized personal robot that can tie a bow tie as well as brush it
off.</TE>
<TE>   Here and elsewhere, the film also makes such inventive use of
computer-generated special effects, including some mind-bending rides
at something called the Troublemaker Theme Park, that they underline
how predictable much current work has become.</TE>
<TE>   "Spy Kids 2" picks up with the Cortez family, America's favorite
Latino espionage ensemble, where the last film left off. Kids Carmen
(Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) know that parents Gregorio
(Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) are secret agents in the
spy organization OSS and want to join the family business themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the kids spies, they've got lots of competition. The
notion of having spy kids on your team has now become a worldwide
program, complete with its own school. Naturally, the kids want more
responsibility and bigger missions and the parents worry that they
won't be needed anymore.</TE>
<TE>   With success comes competition, and the Cortez kids are engaged in
a rivalry with the Giggles siblings, teenage careerist Gary (Matt
O'Leary), on whom Carmen has a secret crush, and feisty young Gerti
(Emily Osment, Haley Joel's younger sister). The Giggles kids always
seem to have the newest gear and the trendiest clothes, and their dad
Donnagon (Mike Judge) just happens to be a rival of Gregorio Cortez
in the grown-up OSS.</TE>
<TE>   "Spy Kids 2" begins in an amusement park run by Dinky Winks (an
amusing Bill Paxton) and being visited by young Alexandra (Taylor
Momsen of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), the daughter of the
president. Irked that her dad doesn't have time for her, she's lifted
the supersecret Transmooker Device from his office, not caring one
whit that should the device fall into the proverbial "wrong hands,"
the world would be doomed.</TE>
<TE>   The trail of the Transmooker ends up leading to that Island of
Lost Dreams of the title, and its principal dreamer, a gently
demented scientist named Romero who's created all kinds of
imaginative creatures wondrous to behold. (Romero is played by Steve
Buscemi, who does a fine job of adjusting his offbeat style to the
demands of a family film.)</TE>
<TE>   One reason "Spy Kids 2" is as long as it is, is that Rodriguez
wanted to give cameos to first-film stalwarts like Fegan Floop (Alan
Cumming) and Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) while also introducing
new characters like Ingrid Cortez's parents, played by Ricardo
Montalban and Holland Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   He also had to find time (and this was a good idea) to include the
lessons he wants youngsters to learn from his film, notions that
range from the centrality of family to the way simple things like a
rubber band can be more helpful than the latest nanotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably for a sequel, one thing "Spy Kids 2" doesn't have is
the excitement of seeing something fresh and new. Rodriguez has tried
to compensate by tossing in references to other films, from "Raiders
of the Lost Ark" and "Jurassic Park" to a dueling-skeletons tribute
to animation wizard Ray Harryhausen. A lesser film might have been
overwhelmed by all this, but it's a tribute to Rodriguez's
imagination that "Spy Kids 2" remains indisputably its own picture
through it all.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for action sequences and brief rude humor. Times
guidelines: mild by today's standards.</TE>

<LD>NBC and CBS posted another neck-and-neck finish in prime time last
week, while Fox's "American Idol" climbed the charts to its biggest
audience yet and ABC continued to weather an arid summer, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Prime-time standings have been dominated this summer by a mix of
more easily repeatable scripted series ("CSI," the various editions
of "Law &amp; Order"), newsmagazines ("48 Hours," in particular, has
thrived on Mondays) and cheap, unscripted series. Of those, NBC's
"Dog Eat Dog" actually out-rates "Idol" in overall viewing, and NBC
also posted respectable tune-in last week with its premiere of "The
Rerun Show."</LD>
<LD>   Viewers are clearly sampling such programs at the expense of
reruns, with both "Idol" and ABC's "The Mole II" exceeding NBC's
combo of "Frasier" and "Scrubs" last Tuesday. "Scrubs" did fare
better Thursday--the time slot the comedy will regularly occupy in
the fall--losing a mere 14% of the "Friends" audience preceding it.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's "The Pulse," meanwhile, is barely exhibiting one, as viewing
of the news program has inched downward with each of its four
telecasts. ABC's latest made-for-prime-time golf event featuring
Tiger Woods also pitched in subpar ratings--down 12% compared with
the prior year, with steeper losses among younger male demographic
groups. Still, the match delivered the network's second-highest
Monday rating this summer.</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (July 29-Aug. 4) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research.
They are based on the average number of people who watched a program
from start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million
potential viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed
in millions.</TE>

<HD>This Show Could Use a Gong for Everyone</HD>
<DH>Fox's 'American Idol' is just no way to actually select a
new pop star. And while we're at it, let's judge the judges too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest misconception about "American Idol" is that industry pros
would actually spend 90 seconds listening to these mostly drab
performers--as the judges do on the hit TV show that mixes the
Cinderella aspects of "Star Search" with the humiliation of
"Survivor."</LD>
<LD>   Knowing how impatient label talent scouts are, my guess is that
few of the six singers still in the competition would get more than
30 seconds at the microphone before being shown the door--assuming
they would even get in the door.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that these six are supposed to be the best of 10,000
original candidates is sobering. Then again, the show--with its glitz
and inbred dumbness--is hardly designed to find the next Kurt Cobain
or Ryan Adams.</LD>
<TE>   This is another show made for "Star Search" hero Sam Harris.</TE>
<TE>   The second misconception about "American Idol" is that Simon
Cowell, the British record executive who is one of the three judges,
is going out of his way to be mean to the contestants so that he
serves as the show's equivalent of "Weakest Link" hostess Anne
Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, Cowell comes across as the only judge who consistently
makes sense. If anything, he's restrained in his remarks.</TE>
<TE>   When he called Floridian entry Christina Christian "good" after
her pedestrian version of Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine" on last
week's show, you wondered if he really didn't mean "tolerable."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, you were thankful for anything even approaching the
rational after hearing cheerleader Paula Abdul gush about Christian:
"What a job! I think this is your golden moment. From top to bottom
... you are a star."</TE>
<TE>   What did you expect from a pop star who has exhibited no real
talent herself other than video choreography?</TE>
<TE>   Randy Jackson, the third judge, is also prone to overstatement.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent," he raved after
watching R.J. Helton smother the life out of Stevie Wonder's
"Superstition."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul, the former Laker Girl, exclaimed: "That's what I've been
waiting for!"</TE>
<TE>   Only Cowell seemed to notice that Helton's performance is as
sleazy as a Chippendale stripper's.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy band, yes," he said sternly. "American idol, no."</TE>
<TE>   To really liven things up next season, the show's producers ought
to borrow a feature from the old "Gong Show," which allowed judges to
bring a merciful halt to a performance at any point.</TE>
<TE>   The devilish stroke would be to have a panel of critics with the
ability to kick off judges who make inane remarks. That way we could
have two contests each week--contestants and judges.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it might have worked with a couple of the contestants
on last week's episode of "American Idol." The idea is, you get two
"gongs" before being booted off the panel.</TE>
<TE>   First, Nikki McKibbin, a bright-eyed Kelly Osbourne look-alike,
performs a painfully derivative version of the Pat Benatar hit
"Heartbreaker." The judges remarks are condensed.</TE>
<TE>   Randy's evaluation: "Love the outfit, love the hair.... "</TE>
<TE>   Paula: "It's a great thing from week to week how you keep finding
your own path.... Congratulations."</TE>
<TE>   Simon: "We are trying to find the best undiscovered talent in
America. That was a copycat performance--not good enough and you will
not win the show."</TE>
<TE>   Verdict: You have to feel sorry for Jackson because you know this
veteran musician and record producer must have to spend half his life
telling people he's not part of the Jackson 5 family. Still, he's
halfway to a gong with that answer. Only Abdul, however, gets
officially gonged here. McKibbin, by the way, would be out the door
in 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Ryan Starr with a punkette performance of Donna Summer's
"Last Dance."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson: "It wasn't exciting to me. I thought you performed it
better than you sang it."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul: "I disagree completely. You picked a song you were allowed
to enjoy yourself and have fun. It was in your range, and everyone
enjoyed it. Good for you."</TE>
<TE>   Cowell: "What we are looking for is originality. If you survive
this week, and I think you probably will, you've got to make up your
mind what you want to be, because I haven't got a clue."</TE>
<TE>   Verdict: Right on, Simon! He was wrong, though. Starr, quite
rightly, was the one voted off the show last week. Abdul is gonged
again, so she's history on the show. Jackson gets gonged here for
offering any praise, meaning one more gong and he's out, too.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking talent on last week's show by far was Amanda
Gray, a 23-year-old former Miss Atlanta whose rendition of Gladys
Knight's "If I Were Your Woman," had moments of genuine style.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Abdul seemed out of control with her comments: "You
just keep pole-vaulting higher and higher and higher. Good for you."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, again, wins the round by pointing out that if viewers don't
vote Gray the winner in the contest, it's madness.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will be chosen Sept. 3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Wake me when it's over.</TE>

<HD>AOL's New Chief Inherits Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Media: Jon Miller faces the challenges of a mature firm
trying to keep up with changing technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Job No. 1 for Jonathan Miller, named Tuesday as chief executive of
America Online, will be helping the company figure out what it wants
to be, now that it's all grown up.</LD>
<LD>   AOL burst into the American mainstream in the mid-1990s with its
friendly, easy-to-use Internet service and signed up millions of
customers.</LD>
<LD>   Once a scrappy technology start-up, AOL today finds itself mired
in the problems of a mature company struggling to keep up with a
technology revolution it helped ignite.</LD>
<TE>   Over the last two years, the Dulles, Va.-based online service has
fallen from being one of America's most highly touted businesses to a
troubled entity valued at virtually nothing on Wall Street in the
aftermath of the merger that created AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide, AOL counts about 34 million subscribers, about 25
million of them in the United States--far ahead of its largest rival,
Microsoft Corp.'s MSN service, with 7.7 million domestic customers.
However, most of AOL's customers use a slow dial-up phone connection,
and more business is migrating to higher-speed Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the king of the dial-up business, which throws off a lot
of cash," said Blair Levin, analyst at Legg Mason in Washington. "But
it's a diminishing business. The trends are not favorable to them."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 45, an e-commerce veteran at Barry Diller's USA
Interactive Inc., said in an interview Tuesday that he was aware of
the hurdles he has inherited at AOL. But he disagrees about their
degree of severity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the company is off in a terribly wrong way," said
Miller, who promised to unveil a new business plan for AOL by this
fall. "It just needs to be refocused. It's a very big, very
profitable business. The challenge is to keep it that way."</TE>
<TE>   High-Speed or Dial-Up?</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the debate over AOL is whether the company should
reinvent itself as a traditional media property, a sort of online
magazine or television network with a strong emphasis on programming
and content, or pay closer attention to technology.</TE>
<TE>   While the bulk of online subscribers continue to rely on the type
of dial-up service that AOL dominates, increasing numbers of people
are opting for high-speed Internet connections via their cable or
phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   "AOL has to deal with the slowing growth in dial-up subscribers,"
said Chris Charron, a research director with Forrester Research Inc.
in Cambridge, Mass. "They need to figure out how to move subscribers
to a broadband environment."</TE>
<TE>   Here, AOL's chief obstacle has been its inability to cut crucial
deals with cable companies to offer its online service across their
high-speed lines. AOL is negotiating with AT&amp;T Corp., Comcast Corp.
and others, but there are disagreements over who should control the
customer relationship and how profits should be divided.</TE>
<TE>   Without a contract with a large cable operator, "this business
could be a single-digit growth business, if they're lucky," said
Michael Gallant, an analyst at CIBC World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that AOL has sold high-speed service to only
about 500,000 subscribers, including 400,000 on digital subscriber
lines (DSL) telephone lines and 100,000 on its sister cable company,
Time Warner Cable.</TE>
<TE>   However, the rollout of broadband has been much slower than most
people anticipated and the market remains fragmented, giving AOL some
breathing space.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, about 11.1 million homes had high-speed Internet access
in the United States. This year, that figure is projected to increase
to 18.8 million, or about 14% of U.S. households, according to
Forrester.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is the third boss at America Online this year, part of a
broad reshuffling of management at AOL Time Warner's executive suite.</TE>
<TE>   Miller acknowledged AOL's challenge to win broadband subscribers,
but he saw no need to box AOL into a certain category. Nor was he
worried that the company will be eclipsed by broadband.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to put things in specific buckets because it's easier
to talk about," Miller said. "But when you look at AOL today, it's
media, it's e-commerce and it's Internet. It's all of the above."</TE>
<TE>   Miller declined to talk about specific changes he plans to make,
but said his forthcoming business plan would focus on improving
content and leveraging e-commerce opportunities. Miller also plans to
focus on developing new features specifically targeted at broadband
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Loyal Customers</TE>
<TE>   AOL boasts that it holds several advantages in a broadband world,
including the use of Time Warner music and movies, and strong
customer loyalty. Many AOL users are loath to give up their e-mail
addresses and AOL's proprietary instant-messaging system, which has
about 55 million users nationwide, or more than MSN and Yahoo
combined.</TE>
<TE>   AOL recently broke a promise to allow other instant-messaging
services to connect to its service, saying the technology and
security hurdles are too high. That should allow AOL to maintain its
lock on the instant-message market.</TE>
<TE>   Such loyalty is already helping AOL compete in the broadband
market. Even when AOL customers buy high-speed access from a rival
company, as many as 3 million still opt to continue paying for AOL
each month, analysts estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Dial-up Internet service "is a hugely profitable business and it's
not going away tomorrow. Broadband is a slow build. It's going to
take longer," Miller said. "The opportunity to lead in broadband is
still very much in AOL's future."</TE>
<TE>   Restoring Stability</TE>
<TE>   Miller's boss, Don Logan, who was recently named to head AOL Time
Warner's media properties, predicted that Miller's arrival should
help reduce the confusion about the AOL's identity and restore
stability.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been tremendous management changes," Logan said. "With
that there have been movements back and forth, shifts in priorities.
We weren't as consistent as we should have been. You would expect the
organization to be whipsawed."</TE>
<TE>   When AOL began offering easy Internet access in the mid-1980s, few
rivals had the kind of services and content that AOL boasted. In
1996, AOL also pioneered the practice of charging a flat monthly
rate, and consumers flocked to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet is more mature now, and AOL is being eaten away by
specialists that provide just one service, whether it's auctions or
tickets or travel," said Charron of Forrester Research. "Does AOL
continue to try to be all things to all people? Do they need to
specialize?"</TE>
<TE>   As Miller sorts out AOL's priorities, smaller rivals--including
movie ticket, travel and financial Web sites--continue to nibble at
its heels, siphoning off advertising and e-commerce revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Denise Garcia, media research director at GartnerG2, said despite
AOL's recent ad slump, the unit still must focus on revitalizing ad
sales and rebuilding its sales force, which has suffered from heavy
turnover. Advertising and commerce revenue at the AOL unit fell 42%
during the second quarter ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to focus on straightforward, cash ad deals, not these
business development deals," Garcia said, referring to the kind of
creative marketing deal that AOL has engaged in recently. Some of
those deals are now the focus of a criminal probe by the Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   More E-Commerce</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are predicting that Miller will bring his e-commerce
skills to bear in devising a growth strategy for AOL, particularly as
advertising continues its slump and subscriber growth is stagnating.</TE>
<TE>   "I anticipate that we will see e-commerce becoming a bigger piece
of the puzzle," Charron said.</TE>
<TE>   "AOL could either purchase an online merchant or promote
e-commerce more prominently as a place where people can go to not
only get the product, but also get the lowdown on the product with
reviews from the AOL community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Miller faces another challenge: low staff morale.</TE>
<TE>   To help boost morale, managers have been sending out regular
e-mails to employees.</TE>
<TE>   But the collapse of AOL Time Warner's stock price has stung. The
stock fell 5 cents Tuesday to close at $9.90 on the New York Stock
Exchange. It has fallen 90% from its record high of $95.81 in
December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, many employees could earn more each year by cashing
in stock options than they did from their base salary. No more.
Today, most of those options are deep underwater, and for the first
time in years, many employees are living on their paychecks alone.</TE>

<HD>FBI Warns of Hacker Attacks From Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online security experts were on alert Tuesday in the wake of an FBI
warning of possible attacks on Web sites and Internet service
providers from hackers in Western Europe. But all seemed quiet on the
Internet front during the day.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not seeing anything that is out of the ordinary," said
Marty Lindner of the CERT Coordination Center, a government-funded
program that monitors the Internet for security breaches.</LD>
<LD>   Based at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, CERT was
founded in 1988 in response to the Morris worm attack that shut down
10% of Internet systems.</LD>
<TE>   "We get reports of attacks every day, but nothing happened that
was outside the status quo," Lindner said. "Today was just like
yesterday and the day before."</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials would not say what information resulted in the
attack warning issued late Monday, except to say it was "credible but
nonspecific."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the agency said Tuesday afternoon that the FBI
also knew of no widespread attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The warning by the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center
was described as an alert, which is the NIPC's most urgent category.
The only other alerts issued this year were to warn in April of the
Klez.h e-mail worm and a February disclosure of security
vulnerabilities to the SNMP protocol used by Net equipment.</TE>

<HD>Treasury Yields Rebound From Generational Lows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street is growing more convinced that the Federal Reserve will
cut short-term interest rates again. But that sentiment didn't help
the bond market on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury yields rebounded after diving on Monday, when rates on
some government securities fell to generational lows.</LD>
<LD>   Bond traders said the market was under pressure as the government
sold $22 billion in five-year T-notes to fund the growing federal
deficit, and as the stock market revived, causing some bond owners to
sell and shift capital to stocks.</LD>
<TE>   The stock market's rally was attributed in part to a report from
brokerage Lehman Bros. saying the Fed is likely to cut its key
short-term rate, now 1.75%, to 1% by year's end to help the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Central bank policymakers will meet on Tuesday, though most
analysts don't expect a cut so soon. Instead, many experts believe
the Fed will signal at the meeting that it is prepared to cut rates
further, and will do so later this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury market, yields have tumbled over the last three
weeks, driven lower by a demand for "safe haven" securities as stocks
have dropped, and reflecting rising belief that the Fed will ease
credit, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on five-year T-notes plunged from 3.8% on July 15 to a
generational low of 3.11% on Monday. On Tuesday the yield on newly
auctioned five-year notes was 3.35%.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on 10-year T-notes jumped to 4.33% Tuesday from 4.21%
Monday, and the two-year note yield rose to 2.04% from 1.89% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields may fall again in the next few days if economic
reports are weak, putting more pressure on the Fed to cut rates,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Interest-rate futures contracts show traders see about a 2-in-3
chance the Fed will cut its key rate to 1.5% when it meets Sept. 24.</TE>

<HD>Restaurants May Have Served Tainted Desserts</HD>
<DH>Food: Customers at 19 Olive Garden outlets may have been
exposed to listeria bacteria, Cheesecake Factory says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cheesecake Factory Inc. said Tuesday that its cheesecakes
contaminated with the potentially deadly listeria bacteria may have
been served to Olive Garden customers at 19 restaurants in the
Midwest and the South.</LD>
<LD>   The news could stain the Calabasas Hills-based chain's reputation
and eventually hurt its sales and stock, some analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The chain's statement that consumers may have eaten the white
chocolate raspberry cheesecakes sold to Olive Garden came just a day
after Cheesecake Factory said it was confident nobody had eaten the
contaminated products.</LD>
<TE>   Cheesecake Factory executives declined to comment further Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A serious case of listeriosis takes one to six weeks to develop,
according to the Food and Drug Administration and other government
agencies. An estimated 500 people annually die from it, with the
elderly, pregnant women, children and those with weakened immune
systems most at risk. Serious infections also can result in
meningitis and miscarriages.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, Darden Restaurants Inc., parent of Olive
Garden and Red Lobster restaurants, has stopped selling Cheesecake
Factory products at its restaurants since learning of the tainted
cakes on Thursday. The Orlando, Fla.-based chain has dispatched two
scientists to California to inspect Cheesecake Factory's
manufacturing plant in Calabasas Hills today, said Darden spokesman
Jim DeSimone.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be thoroughly satisfied that the proper standards have
been reestablished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Cheesecake Factory announced it had recalled a batch of
contaminated cheesecakes sold to Olive Garden. It also recalled all
of its baked goods made from July 18 to July 21 as a precautionary
measure. The company, which said it has been working with the FDA and
Olive Garden, said the tainted batch was shipped because of "human
error."</TE>
<TE>   None of the contaminated cakes was sent to Cheesecake Factory or
any other wholesaler, the company said. There have been no reports of
illness due to the cakes.</TE>
<TE>   Because of all the uncertainty, analyst David Rose of JMP
Securities in San Francisco said he downgraded his rating on
Cheesecake Factory's stock to "market underperform" from "market
perform," even though he said the company is among the strongest in
the restaurant industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The halo has been tarnished," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rose said the negative publicity generated by the recall could
hurt Cheesecake Factory's restaurant and wholesale businesses.
Wholesale bakery sales account for about 8% of the company's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Elliott, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates, said
Tuesday he lowered his third-quarter profit estimate for Cheesecake
Factory by 1 cent, to 25 cents, because of the expected lost business
and other costs associated with the recall.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury's out on how much it's going to hurt the company, but it
certainly can't help," said Dennis Milton, a Standard &amp; Poor's
analyst with an "accumulate" rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   But not all analysts subscribe to the doom-and-gloom scenario.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hickok of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis said
Cheesecake Factory is so well managed and enjoys such a stellar
reputation with consumers that it should continue to fare well.</TE>
<TE>   The typical outlet generates annual revenue of $11 million, more
than four times the average for a casual-dining chain, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping 9% Monday on news of the recall, company shares
roared back. Cheesecake Factory stock rose $2.49 Tuesday to close at
$30.69 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Unless somebody falls ill, the worst is probably behind the
company, said Lynne Collier, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in Dallas.
"I'm not overly concerned," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The contaminated cakes reached the 19 Olive Garden restaurants in
six states--mostly in Texas but also in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Louisiana--between July 26 and July 31.</TE>
<TE>   Although Olive Garden removed and destroyed about 2,500 white
chocolate raspberry cakes from its restaurants and distributors after
learning of the contamination, "we can't absolutely rule out the
possibility that somebody consumed one of these products before we
got notice from the Cheesecake Factory," Darden spokesman DeSimone
said.</TE>
<TE>   People most commonly contract listeriosis by eating contaminated
food. Healthy people rarely fall ill from it.</TE>
<TE>   There have been several high-profile cases, including one in Los
Angeles in 1985 that resulted in 46 deaths. The outbreak was traced
to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured with contaminated milk.</TE>

<HD>Hilton to Pay $159,000 to Owner of Hotel</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp. said it was ordered to pay $159,000 in damages
stemming from alleged violations of an exclusivity clause in its
contract with a San Antonio Hilton, which had sought as much as $200
million in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came after a hearing before an arbitration panel
earlier this year in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The Palacio Hilton's owner had been seeking the large damage
award, partly stemming from a non-compete clause in its contract with
Hilton and partly stemming from allegations of mismanagement.</LD>
<TE>   An attorney for the hotel's owners said that they may still pursue
claims of mismanagement against Hilton when they receive information
from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Under the ruling, Hilton also was ordered to end its ties with a
proposed Embassy Suites--one of the Hilton brands--hotel planned near
the Palacio.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton was also ordered to tell Palacio's owners how it used
customer information it received through its operation of the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   A Hilton spokeswoman confirmed the details of the settlement, but
had no further comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Developer Maguire Partners has begun work on the long-delayed second
phase of its Plaza Las Fuentes project in Pasadena that will house
the headquarters of investment firm Western Asset Management,
according to city officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based developer has begun to clear the site at the
northwest corner of Colorado Boulevard and Los Robles Avenue in
preparation for constructing a five-story, 270,000-square-foot
building. City officials say that Western Asset Management, currently
housed in a smaller facility in historic Old Pasadena, will occupy
about 150,000 square feet in the structure, which will be named
Western Asset Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   Officials with Maguire Partners could not be reached to discuss
the project. An official with Western Asset Management declined to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   The project will keep Western Asset in the city, where it plans to
expand its work force to nearly 600 people from 270, said Kirk Pelsr,
a development administrator with the city of Pasadena.</TE>

<HD>Cisco Beats Forecasts With Surge in Profit</HD>
<DH>Tech: Company earns $772 million, up from $7 million a year
ago, but results don't necessarily signal a sector recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. beat Wall Street
expectations Tuesday with strong quarterly profit, but the results
don't necessarily mean the beleaguered tech sector has finally
glimpsed the light at the end of the tunnel.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose-based Cisco said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter
ballooned to $772 million, or 10 cents a share, up dramatically from
$7 million, or less than a penny a share, in the same period last
year. Net sales for the three months ended July 27 reached $4.8
billion, a 12% increase over sales of $4.3 billion a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding charges related to payroll tax on stock options
exercised by employees, acquisitions and other nonrecurring items,
Cisco's earnings were $1 billion, or 14 cents a share, up from $163
million, or 2 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   On that basis, the company beat analysts' average estimate by 2
cents, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The results, announced after the close of regular trading, sent
Cisco shares as high as $13.12 in after-hours trading. The stock
closed at $12.07, up 71 cents, in regular Nasdaq trading Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Given an extremely challenging market, [the fourth quarter] was a
very solid quarter for Cisco," Chief Executive John Chambers said
during a conference call with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, "it's unclear whether our growth is due to
market share gain or is an indication of where the market is going."</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's market share has grown 12% over the last year, whereas the
combined market share of its 10 biggest competitors has declined 44%
during the same period, Chambers said.</TE>
<TE>   Chet White, senior equity research analyst for Wells Fargo
Securities in Los Angeles, said Cisco's gains came only partly at the
expense of rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Spending by big business customers has boosted sales at Cisco and
rivals such as Foundry Networks Inc. and Extreme Networks Inc. But
Cisco's gains in sales to telecommunications service providers have
meant losses for equipment providers such as Nortel Networks Corp.,
Alcatel and Lucent Technologies Inc., said White, who does not own
any Cisco shares. Cisco is not a Wells Fargo client.</TE>
<TE>   For the full fiscal year, Cisco said its net income was $1.9
billion, or 25 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of $1 billion,
or 14 cents a share, for 2001. Sales for 2002 were $18.9 billion, a
15% decline from the $22.3 billion in sales for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Chambers said Cisco's sales would pick up after the economy as a
whole rebounds, though he declined to make any predictions about how
soon that might happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's economy is a show-me economy, and CEOs will wait to spend
until they see their own revenue and profits pick up," he told
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "While no one can say when the economy will turn around, when it
does turn around, so will network spending."</TE>
<TE>   A survey released Tuesday by Forrester Research offered hope that
the turnaround is underway.</TE>
<TE>   The Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research and consulting firm
predicted that corporate spending on information technology will rise
2.3% this year compared with 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1,001 North American companies surveyed, 82% said their IT
budgets will at least hold steady for the rest of the year, with 19%
saying they will boost spending. Only 12% of firms surveyed said they
planned to cut their IT budgets in the second half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Although some investors have called for companies--especially
technology titans such as Cisco--to include expenses related to stock
option grants in their profit and loss statements, Chambers said he
has no plans to move such expenses out of the footnotes in Cisco's
financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   The most prominent method for calculating the costs related to
stock options doesn't give investors an accurate picture of their
true costs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to create additional problems in terms of
understanding the financials that are involved," Chambers said. "I
applaud the people who say, 'Let's study this carefully and not just
jump into this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chambers also ended speculation on Wall Street by naming Dennis
Powell, Cisco's vice president for corporate finance, as heir
apparent to longtime Chief Financial Officer Larry Carter, "unless he
messes it up."</TE>
<TE>   Cisco has no debt and has amassed a pile of cash and investments
worth $18.3 billion under Carter's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Carter declared his intention to retire in May
on his 60th birthday. Chambers said he would try to persuade Carter
to stay. But when Carter steps down, Powell will replace him.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, Cisco took a one-time charge of $28 million
to write off some of its research and development costs. That amounts
to less than a penny per share.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco also said it boosted the amount of money earmarked for stock
buybacks to $8 billion, up from the $3 billion approved last
September.</TE>
<TE>   Of that $8 billion, which can be spent through Sept. 12, 2003,
about $2 billion has been used to buy back Cisco shares, Chambers
said.</TE>

<HD>Edison Turns Profit in 2nd Quarter</HD>
<DH>Energy: The firm's 'core' earnings of $182 million beat
expectations despite power plant unit's poor performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after its near-death experience during California's energy
crisis, Edison International reported sharply higher earnings Tuesday
despite problems at its subsidiary that builds power plants.</LD>
<LD>   The Rosemead-based company said performance improved at its
Southern California Edison utility, which is collecting more in rates
than it needs to serve its customers. Edison executives said the
utility has repaid $2 billion of its electricity debts and has $1.6
billion to go.</LD>
<LD>   Edison also benefited from a one-time positive adjustment of $480
million because a regulatory decision allowed the utility to place
certain nuclear and other assets on its balance sheet that Edison was
forced to write off last year. At that time, during the worst of the
state's energy woes, Edison doubted it would be able to recover its
electricity debts through customer rates.</LD>
<TE>   But the same low wholesale power costs that have helped Southern
California Edison have hurt Edison Mission Energy, an unregulated
unit that owns and operates power plants around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "To say these were turbulent times in the industry is something of
an understatement," John E. Bryson, Edison's chairman and chief
executive, told analysts in a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Edison posted what it calls "core" earnings of $182 million, or 56
cents per share, for the quarter ended June 30, up 49% from year-ago
core earnings of $122 million, or 37 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Core earnings do not include one-time items--whether Edison's
write-downs of last year or the write-ups of this year--and earnings
from discontinued operations. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call
expected core earnings between 30 cents and 45 cents a share, with an
average of 40 cents..</TE>
<TE>   Edison's consolidated second-quarter net income totaled $665
million, or $2.04, compared with a consolidated loss of $102 million,
or 31 cents, for the same quarter last year. Revenue rose 19.6% to
$2.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison posted second-quarter core earnings of
$215 million, up from $91 million. Edison Mission Energy reported
less than $1 million in earnings from continuing operations compared
with earnings of $41 million in the second quarter of last year. A
third subsidiary, Edison Capital, earned $12 million, down from $24
million.</TE>
<TE>   Edison International also boosted its estimate of earnings for the
year to $1.65 to $1.75 a share, up from previous guidance of $1.50 to
$1.60.</TE>
<TE>   Edison's stock rose $1.03 to close at $11.78 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of PG&amp;E Corp. rose 33 cents to close at $8.63 after falling
51 cents Monday when Moody's Investors Service lowered the credit
rating of PG&amp;E's power-plant-building and energy-trading unit to
"junk" status. Standard &amp; Poor's cut the credit rating of PG&amp;E's
National Energy Group to junk last Thursday, forcing the company to
begin renegotiating $1.6 billion in credit agreements with lenders
who demanded an investment grade credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's action triggered another $1 billion in loans that could be
called by creditors, but PG&amp;E said Monday that creditors had waived
until Aug. 16 a clause that National Energy Group must maintain an
investment grade rating. PG&amp;E, whose Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
utility is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection, said it
continues to negotiate with its creditors.</TE>

<LD>Struggling cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp., whose
founder was arrested on fraud charges last month, said that it named
the dean of Yale Law School and a former cable industry executive to
its board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia said Anthony Kronman, the Yale law
dean, and Rod Cornelius, a private investor and former vice chairman
of both Cablevision Industries and Renaissance Cable, would join the
board as soon as they are approved by the Bankruptcy Court overseeing
its case.</LD>
<LD>   Kronman's background is primarily in corporate responsibility, and
Cornelius has a background in selling cable systems to larger
competitors, according to an Adelphia statement. He sold Renaissance
to Charter Communications Inc., having previously helped organize the
sale of Cablevision Industries to Time Warner.</LD>

<HD>Hispanic Broadcasting Posts 2% Rise in Profit</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hispanic Broadcasting Corp.'s second-quarter profit rose 2% as more
people listened to stations owned by the largest U.S.
Spanish-language radio broadcaster. The company's shares rose 7.1%.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $10.4 million from $10.2 million a year
earlier, and per-share profit of 9 cents was unchanged. Sales rose
4.1% to $68.6 million, the company said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Latinos, targeted by both the company and Univision Communications
Inc., which is buying Hispanic Broadcasting, are the fastest-growing
U.S. demographic group. Hispanic Broadcasting said its Los Angeles,
Houston, San Diego and Las Vegas radio stations are listened to by
more adults age 25 to 54 than any rival.</LD>
<TE>   "We're feeling pretty bullish about the second half of this year
and especially 2003," Chief Executive McHenry Tichenor said during a
conference call with analysts. Still, he said "financial performance
in the second quarter was not up to our standards," citing increased
competition.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas-based company forecast profit of 11 cents to 12 cents a
share and a 6% to 8% rise in third-quarter sales. It still expects
2002 profit of 38 cents to 40 cents. The forecasts exclude
merger-related costs.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting shares rose $1.30 to $19.70 in New York
Stock Exchange trading. They have fallen 23% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Univision, which agreed in June to buy Hispanic Broadcasting for
stock then valued at $3.5 billion, rose $1.85, or 8.4%, to $23.91,
also on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc., the cable television company controlled
by billionaire Paul Allen, had a narrower second-quarter loss and a
25% jump in sales as more customers bought digital and high-speed
Internet service.</LD>
<LD>   The net loss shrank to $202 million, or 69 cents a share, from
$273.9 million, or $1.07, helped by a change in acquisition-related
accounting. Revenue rose to $1.16 billion from $928.5 million,
Charter said in a statement. Per-share results are after the payment
of preferred dividends.</LD>
<LD>   Charter, whose shares have declined 84% this year amid investor
concern about the company's rising debt, said it expects pricier
services such as digital cable and fast Web access to compensate for
a decline in basic cable subscribers by year's end.</LD>
<TE>   The cable operator forecast third-quarter sales of $1.19 billion
to $1.2 billion, up from $1.04 billion a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "The results are slightly better than I would have forecast," said
Matt Kaufler, who helps manage $1.8 billion at Clover Capital
Management, a holder of 775,000 Charter shares. The issue with
Charter, though, is the "ongoing concerns about their debt load."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the St. Louis, Mo.-based company rose 33 cents, or 13%,
to $2.97 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Gilead Hepatitis Drug Wins FDA Panel's OK</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilead Sciences Inc.'s adefovir drug for hepatitis B won the backing
of a Food and Drug Administration expert panel Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The advisory committee voted 15 to 0 to recommend that the FDA
approve the medicine to treat the viral infection that may cause
liver damage and death.</LD>
<LD>   Some panel members raised questions about whether patients on
adefovir should be monitored for signs of liver and kidney damage.
Gilead said it is conducting more long-term studies of adefovir after
the studies submitted to the FDA, which lasted almost a year.</LD>
<TE>   The FDA usually accepts the recommendations of its advisory
panels.</TE>
<TE>   About 1.3 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis B
infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. In some cases, patients with the disease die of chronic
liver disease or require liver transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Adefovir suppresses the virus that causes hepatitis B more
effectively than GlaxoSmithKline's widely used Epivir, Gilead told
the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Epivir often loses its ability to fight the virus over time,
leaving patients without an effective drug to control the virus,
doctors say. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead said it is studying the
use of adefovir combined with Epivir.</TE>
<TE>   Adefovir already has wide support among hepatitis B patients,
including AIDS activist and playwright Larry Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer, who underwent liver-transplant surgery because of
hepatitis B, takes adefovir to keep the virus in check. Founder of
the AIDS activist group ACT UP, he said he has long been a critic of
drug makers.</TE>
<TE>   "I have paid my own expenses to appear before you today to testify
on behalf of adefovir, which I consider to be a wonder drug and which
I believe helped to save my life," Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimate that adefovir could garner annual sales of $100
million to $200 million within a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Gilead won U.S. approval in October for its Viread AIDS treatment.
The company's successes with the FDA stand in contrast to setbacks
for rival biotechnology companies and drug makers seeking U.S.
approval of medicines.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Gilead shares was halted during the FDA panel hearing.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Threatens to Subpoena Stewart Files</HD>
<DH>Probe: Investigators demand e-mail and phone records as
broker's assistant raises new doubts about ImClone stock sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators Tuesday threatened to subpoena records of
Martha Stewart as new doubts swirled about her stated reasons for
selling ImClone Systems Inc. shares just ahead of bad news for the
company.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded that Stewart turn
over e-mail and telephone records as well as reconsider her refusal
to submit to an interview with the panel's investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart is being investigated for possible insider trading for
selling almost 4,000 shares of ImClone in December, before the
company announced regulators had refused to review its cancer drug,
Erbitux.</LD>
<TE>   She has denied wrongdoing, citing a preexisting arrangement to
sell the stock if it fell below $60.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
trading assistant Douglas Faneuil has thrown new doubt on the
preexisting arrangement, telling authorities he called Stewart to
warn her that ImClone's then-Chief Executive Samuel D. Waksal was
selling his shares.</TE>
<TE>   "We are through asking nicely. Clearly someone has been lying to
us and we're going to find out who it is," committee spokesman Ken
Johnson said. "We'll subpoena any documents she refuses to provide."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Stewart through her company, Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia Inc., or her lawyers for comment were not
successful.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials have been investigating possible insider trading
by Stewart and Waksal family members who sold shares before the
company revealed that the Food and Drug Administration was refusing
to review Erbitux, news that sent the shares plummeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been informed that on advice of your counsel, you will
not agree to be interviewed by the committee at this time under any
condition," the committee said in a letter to Stewart. "We sincerely
hope and urge you to reconsider your position."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart's lawyers told the committee in June that the shares were
sold under the preexisting arrangement and she ordered the sale after
a call from her broker at Merrill, Peter Bacanovic.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the House committee Tuesday demanded that Stewart
turn over all communications to and from her e-mail accounts related
to ImClone, Waksal or her account at Merrill from Dec. 1 to Jan. 9.
Additionally, lawmakers sought Stewart's phone records and those of
her business manager, Heidi DeLuca, for the same time period, as well
as any records in DeLuca's possession related to ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Martha Stewart Living fell as low as $7.60 Tuesday but
rebounded to close at $8.17, up 5 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Nestle to Buy Owner of Hot Pockets Brand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Swiss food giant Nestle said Tuesday that it agreed to acquire the
owner of the popular Hot Pockets brand for $2.6 billion in cash, a
deal that would give Nestle the top position in the booming hand-held
frozen-meals business.</LD>
<LD>   Nestle already owns the two best-selling frozen-food brands,
Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine, as well as Ortega frozen Mexican
entrees.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition of Denver-based Chef America, which owns Hot
Pockets, Lean Pockets and Croissant Pockets, takes the company into a
faster-growing and more lucrative area of the frozen-food
business--meals that can be microwaved in a couple of minutes and
eaten on the go.</LD>
<TE>   Sales of these products are growing at more than twice the rate of
the rest of the frozen-meals business.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a product line in Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine that is
not as contemporary as they like," said John McMillin, an analyst
with Prudential Financial Research. "It's product your mother eats."
Teenagers, he says, are the key consumers of Hot Pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Chef America is just one of a number of high-profile food
businesses that are expected to be sold this year as acquisitions in
other industries have cooled down. ConAgra Foods' fresh-meats
division is being sold, while Hershey Foods Corp. and Pfizer Inc.'s
Adams chewing gum division are on the auction block, all with price
tags over $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts called the Chef America deal pricey. But many say
it's worth it, given how profitable Chef America is, earning a 27%
profit margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Moreover, tax benefits in the deal will bring the price down to about
$2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We had been looking at Chef America for 10 or 15 years," said Joe
Weller, chief executive of Nestle USA, the company's American
division based in Glendale. "We've seen a number of people try and
compete with them [in hand-held frozen foods] but not be able to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   The key to Chef America's success, analysts say, has been in its
ability to turn out a baked product that comes out of the microwave
crispy rather than doughy.</TE>
<TE>   With expected sales of about $720 million this year, Chef America
controls half of its niche in hand-held entrees.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle has no similar products, other than a single French bread
pizza. It expects the Chef America deal to close in the next two
months.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle hopes to use its clout with retailers and its global
distribution system to bring Hot Pockets, now sold only domestically,
into other markets around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting on the sidelines during the last round of food
industry consolidation two years ago, Nestle has been moving quickly
to add brands that will make it the leader in a category. In the last
nine months, it has invigorated its core businesses, such as ice
cream, pet food and frozen foods, making major investments such as
December's $11.2-billion purchase of Ralston Purina pet foods, and
its pending deal to gain control of Oakland-based Dreyer's Grand Ice
Cream. (It completed its acquisition of Haagen-Dazs ice cream last
year.)</TE>

<LD>Ribapharm Inc. sued Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. in the Netherlands and

<HD>More Will Expense Stock Options</HD>
<DH>Accounting: General Motors is latest corporation vowing to
change practice. But FASB says mandate may not be set until mid-'03.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More companies--including the world's biggest auto maker--joined the
ranks Tuesday of corporations pledging to expense stock options. But
it could be a year before such disclosures become mandatory for all
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting
rules for U.S. corporations, said Tuesday that it won't be able to
require companies to treat stock options as an expense until as late
as next summer.</LD>
<LD>   Some investors and lawmakers want companies to start recording
options as an expense sooner, arguing it would make income statements
clearer and more accurate. Pressure to adopt the practice intensified
after a series of high-profile bookkeeping scandals.</LD>
<TE>   About 30 companies, including Coca-Cola Co., General Electric Co.
and Bank One Corp., since July 1 have said they will voluntarily
start the practice.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said it will begin expensing
stock options granted to employees in 2003, though the company said
it is concerned about how best to fairly value options.</TE>
<TE>   GM said that in 2003 it expects the expense associated with
options to be about $85 million, or 15 cents a share. GM shares rose
$1.08 to $42.84 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies that Tuesday said they will begin expensing
options included Cooper Industries Ltd., Tupperware Corp., Comerica
Inc. and Emerson Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting standards board, which was rebuffed by a corporate
lobbying campaign in 1994 when it tried to require companies to
expense options, is now under pressure to push through rules
requiring the change.</TE>
<TE>   But FASB Chairman Robert Herz said the group is debating the issue
and would need to consider comments from accountants, executives and
investors to any proposed changes "through the winter" should the
board decide to require firms to expense options. The rules might be
in place by "late spring or early summer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's too slow for some. FASB was chastised at a meeting on
investor confidence hosted by the New York Society of Security
Analysts for moving at a "glacial pace," in the words of one
participant.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to do it," said Byron Wien, senior investment
strategist at Morgan Stanley.</TE>
<TE>   When FASB in 1994 voted to require companies to count options as
an expense, technology companies lobbied Congress to pressure the
FASB to back down. The accounting group did, allowing companies to
leave option costs off income statements if they list the expense in
a footnote.</TE>
<TE>   Most tech companies continue to resist the change. In a conference
call Tuesday, Cisco Systems Inc. said it has no plans to begin
charging options against profit.</TE>
<TE>   Even companies that have pledged to begin expensing option costs
have raised concerns about how to do it accurately. GM on Tuesday
said "current valuation methods are not ideal," and it urged
accountants and regulators to come up with a plan.</TE>

<HD>Premier to Make Changes to Quell Senate Concern</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Premier Inc., a San Diego company that purchases drugs and supplies
for a quarter of the nation's hospitals, has agreed to overhaul the
way it operates to quell allegations of self-dealing, conflict of
interest and anti-competitive practices.</LD>
<LD>   Premier, an alliance of 1,600 nonprofit hospitals and health-care
systems, said it would limit the fees it accepts from vendors and
would open contracts with more companies. It also would no longer
invest in supply companies.</LD>
<LD>   An April hearing by the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate
Judiciary Committee found that group purchasing organizations,
particularly the two biggest, Premier and Novation, had engaged in
anti-competitive conduct and usually didn't help hospitals save
money.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors told the subcommittee they believed they were denied
access to innovative medical devices because the organizations
favored certain suppliers to the detriment of start-up medical device
firms.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee heard allegations that contracts were awarded to
vendors that offered to pay higher commission fees and not to those
that may have had better products or lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Premier said it would adopt a code of conduct released last week
by the Health Industry Group Purchasing Assn. at the request of
subcommittee members.</TE>
<TE>   Under its new policies, Premier said it would cap fees paid by
vendors at 3%, stop issuing contracts to single manufacturers and no
longer bundle certain products into a single contract.</TE>
<TE>   Investigations into the industry by the General Accounting Office
and the Federal Trade Commission are continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Premier's member hospitals in California applauded the
steps it took. But they also said that contrary to criticisms,
purchasing groups such as Premier did help save money.</TE>
<TE>   "We're convinced that our participation in Premier has brought
significant value in reducing costs," said Anne Pumpian, chief
financial officer at Sharp Healthcare, a major nonprofit hospital
operator in the San Diego area.</TE>

are investigating the relationship between AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
America Online division and PurchasePro, citing people familiar with
the matter.</LD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Community Development Bank, created after the 1992
riots to fund businesses in depressed areas of L.A., has 18 months to
become self-sufficient or it will be shut down, the City Council
decided Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, the largest community lending experiment in the
country's history, has been racked by bad investments, risky loans,
poor management, lawsuits and accusations that it misdirected federal
money intended for businesses in the bank's service area, which
includes parts of central, east and South-Central Los Angeles as well
as Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, council members approved a plan from the city's
Community Development Department and the bank that aims to improve
the bank's financial condition, focus more tightly on creating jobs
in the target area and minimize the city's liability if an upcoming
audit by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development determines that the bank used federal money
improperly.</LD>

<HD>FDA: Abbott Delayed Adverse Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abbott Laboratories failed to quickly report some potentially serious
reactions to drugs, including its obesity medicine Meridia and
antibiotic Biaxin, the Food and Drug Administration said in a warning
letter.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA letter, dated July 19, said Abbott "did not submit serious
and unexpected adverse drug experience reports" within 15 days of
learning of the reactions. The letter also said some Abbott reports
were inaccurate or did not reflect all information, such as three
reports of deaths associated with Meridia.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA isn't questioning the safety and effectiveness of the
products, Abbott said. The company said the delays stem from the
integration of reporting systems for Abbott's international business
and its Knoll unit, purchased last year from BASF. The company has
acted to correct deficiencies that inspectors found this year, though
some of its responses were inadequate, the FDA said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Abbott Park, Ill.-based Abbott rose 22 cents to $38.07
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>New Jersey will sue companies whose misleading financial reports or
mismanagement led to losses in the state's $73-billion pension funds,
Atty. Gen. David Samson said.</LD>
<LD>   The state has identified at least $1 billion in losses that may be
due to improper actions by corporations whose stock was held by the
funds, the attorney general's office said. The funds have declined
22% over the last two years because of a falling stock market and
increased pension payments.</LD>
<LD>   Several states are considering lawsuits in an attempt to recoup
pension fund losses.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it may create a voluntary
system to verify whether shipments of crops were genetically altered.
The move comes as the U.S. begins market-opening talks with its World
Trade Organization partners, many of which oppose or are ambivalent
about biotech crops.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed industry-funded system, companies could choose
to detail to the USDA how they keep products separate from
gene-altered crops at all levels of the food chain. Federal
inspectors would review a company's system and verify that minimum
requirements for crop production, handling and processing were
followed.</LD>

<LD>Internal documents show two drug companies knew a pharmacist was
diluting cancer drugs as long as three years before his arrest,
according to a motion filed by patients' attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   The motion said neither Eli Lilly &amp; Co. nor Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. contacted the government about its discovery about Robert
Courtney. The former Kansas City, Mo., pharmacist pleaded guilty in
February to 20 federal criminal charges of tampering with,
adulterating and misbranding chemotherapy medications.</LD>
<LD>   According to the motion, the companies detected possible fraud in
1998 using tracking systems that determine where their drugs are
being sold, in part to uncover counterfeiting schemes such as
Courtney's.</LD>
<TE>   Eli Lilly dismissed the allegations. Bristol-Myers did not respond

<LD>Verizon Communications Inc. will combine local, long-distance and
wireless calling with high-speed Internet access on one bill to try
to stem customer losses and increase sales, which fell last quarter
for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The discounted offer initially will be available to consumers in
Boston and New York state. It will be sold in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania starting next month and to all of Verizon's U.S.
customers--including those in California--early in the second quarter
of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The plan will boost sales by $500 million to $1 billion over five
to six years, Verizon Chief Marketing Officer Maura Breen said at a
news conference in Washington. It also will lower costs, she said
without being more specific.</LD>

<LD>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a marketing campaign by
Web address provider VeriSign Inc., a source close to the probe said.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC is seeking information about the company's practices with
regard to transferring Web addresses, deleting domain names and
sending direct-mail solicitations to customers of competitors in the
marketing campaign that ended in May, the source said, and the
company later confirmed.</LD>
<LD>   Competitors and a class-action attorney have filed four lawsuits
against the company over its marketing practices.</LD>
<TE>   The FTC, which was not available for comment, also is asking the
company whether it had any role in approving Web hosting company
Interland Inc.'s solicitation for domain name services, VeriSign
spokesman Brian O'Shaugnessy confirmed. The company will cooperate
fully with the FTC, he said.</TE>
<TE>   No one was available at Atlanta-based Interland to comment.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its stock near a 52-week low, EarthLink Inc. said it has adopted
a "poison-pill" defense plan to discourage hostile takeover bids. The
Atlanta-based Internet service provider also plans to spend as much
as $25 million to repurchase company shares.</LD>
<LD>   EarthLink shares rose 84 cents, or 17.8%, to $5.56 on Nasdaq.
Shares hit an intra-day 52-week low of $4.40 on July 26. EarthLink
shares are down more than 60% this year.</LD>
<LD>   "We definitely feel that we are undervalued," spokesman Dan
Greenfield said.</LD>
<TE>   Under the shareholder rights plan, EarthLink will issue a dividend
of one right for each outstanding common share that was owned by the
close of business Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Those rights become exercisable if a third party buys or makes an
offer for 15% or more of EarthLink's common stock. At that point,
EarthLink shareholders would be granted the right to buy shares of
EarthLink common stock at 50% off the current market price.</TE>
<TE>   EarthLink said it was not aware of any attempts to acquire it.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of U.S. work visas issued to foreigners has fallen by half
in the last fiscal year, a drop analysts attributed more to the
foundering U.S. technology industry than to a post-Sept. 11 visa
crackdown.</LD>
<LD>   About 60,500 temporary visas for foreigners with special
computer-related or other technical skills were issued from Oct. 1,
2001, to June 30, compared with 130,700 issued in the same period
during the previous fiscal year, according to the Justice
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service.</LD>
<LD>   Lucent Technologies Inc. and Motorola Inc. were among the
companies applying for fewer H-1B visas as they shed thousands of
jobs. Demand for foreign workers has slumped along with the computer
technology industry, analysts said. The American Stock Exchange
Technology Select Sector Index of 90 companies fell 17.25% for the
first nine months of the fiscal year.</LD>

<HD>Loews Chain Files for Stock Offering</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp., the theater chain that emerged
from bankruptcy protection less than five months ago, filed Tuesday
for a $300-million initial public offering, with some stock to be
sold by shareholder Oaktree Capital Management.</LD>
<LD>   Loews and an affiliate of Oaktree, a Los Angeles-based firm that
invests in distressed companies, will sell an unspecified number of
Class A common shares in the IPO, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   The Oaktree affiliate acquired 40% of New York-based Loews in the
theater chain's bankruptcy reorganization. Onex Corp., a Toronto
investment company, acquired a 60% stake.</LD>
<TE>   Loews plans to use an unspecified portion of the IPO proceeds to
repay debt and fund general needs, including expansion moves such as
building or buying theaters, according to the filing. The company
owns, manages or has an interest in 282 Loews, Cineplex Odeon and
other theaters.</TE>
<TE>   The filing did not say how many shares will be offered or their
price. Loews plans to list the shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders Required to</TE>
<TE>   File Stock Deals Faster</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, carrying out a provision
of a new U.S. accounting law, said it plans to require corporate
insiders to begin faster filing of their company stock transactions
on Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate insiders will have to report changes in company stock
ownership within two business days of the purchase or sale. Until
now, company officers, directors and principal shareholders didn't
have to report purchases or sales until 10 days after the end of the
calendar month, which meant a reporting gap of as many as 40 days.</TE>
<TE>   The new deadlines aim to give investors a better idea of insiders'
activities and restore confidence in business.</TE>

<HD>Air Official Seeks Talks With Auto Companies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The head of the California Air Resources Board expressed hope Tuesday
that the state and the auto industry could work out their differences
over California's new law cracking down on so-called greenhouse gas
emissions.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at an annual summer auto conference in northern Michigan,
CARB Chairman Alan Lloyd said Gov. Gray Davis had instructed him to
meet with auto executives after the industry vowed to fight the
legislation in court.</LD>
<LD>   "This seems to be the ideal opportunity to engage in a dialogue,"
Lloyd said at the conference, not the most welcoming of milieus for
pro-environmental views. "I welcome the opportunity to sit down with
the auto industry to work out our differences."</LD>
<TE>   The state legislation requires auto makers to significantly reduce
vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global
warming by the 2009 model year. The law also covers methane, nitrous
oxide and fluorocarbons.</TE>
<TE>   The industry objects to the law, saying it is a thinly disguised
mandate to increase fuel economy, an area for which the federal
government is responsible, not individual states.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, intends to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions but believes that legislation
restricting the gas is the wrong way to improve air quality, said
Christine Sloane, GM's director of advanced technology strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to stabilize CO2 levels in the atmosphere ... the
developed world would have to reduce CO2 emissions by 90%, and no
economy can handle that," she said. Trying to control carbon dioxide
in California alone would not help global climate control, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento-based Lloyd said he did not have a timetable to meet
with specific auto executives. But when he does, he said, he will
tell them that 80% of Californians support cleaner autos and that
other countries have put limits on carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   "I will say we have a piece of legislation which is very broad,"
he said, "but it is an opportunity for us to work together toward a
common target."</TE>
<TE>   David Garman, the Energy Department's assistant secretary for
energy efficiency, said that because carbon dioxide is not considered
a pollutant, the California law is aimed not at reducing pollution
but increasing gas mileage. And that, he said, "by federal law, is
the job of the Department of Transportation."</TE>
<TE>   CARB has two years to come up with details of the standards,
assuming the law withstands legal challenges. GM and DaimlerChrysler
won an injunction in June against the state's zero-emission vehicle
mandate, under which the six largest manufacturers would have to have
4% of their cars and trucks sold in California be emission-free by
the 2003 model year.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd would not speculate on how the issue might play out in the
courts, but because "we haven't even defined the measures yet," he
said, critics "can't call them draconian."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Community Bank Gets Ultimatum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Community Development Bank, created after the 1992
riots to fund businesses in depressed areas of L.A., has 18 months to
become self-sufficient or it will be shut down, the City Council
decided Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bank, the largest community lending experiment in the
country's history, has been racked by bad investments, risky loans,
poor management, lawsuits and accusations that it misdirected federal
money intended for businesses in the bank's service area, which
includes parts of central, east and South-Central Los Angeles as well
as Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, council members approved a plan from the city's
Community Development Department and the bank that aims to improve
the bank's financial condition, focus more tightly on creating jobs
in the target area and minimize the city's liability if an upcoming
audit by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development determines that the bank used federal money
improperly.</LD>
<TE>   When the bank was created in 1995, it was given 10 years of
federal funding--routed through city government--before it had to
become self-sufficient. The 18-month deadline, imposed unanimously
Tuesday, accelerates the process. Council members also approved only
six months of funding to keep the bank operating. By October, they
want to see a business plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is to keep things on a short leash and to make sure we have
continued oversight of what is happening throughout that 18-month
period," said Councilman Eric Garcetti, chairman of the council's
Economic Development and Employment committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The clock now is ticking," Garcetti added, saying he is confident
the bank can become self-sufficient if it can attract outside
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Bank officials plan to begin doing that, President and CEO William
Chu said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a need for economic development in the empowerment
zone and other low- and moderate-income areas," Chu said. "Obviously,
there is a need for us to be there."</TE>
<TE>   According to bank figures, the bank has lent and invested $130
million since its inception, helping to create more than 3,200 jobs
at more than 120 businesses. Loans have been as small as $5,000 and
as large as one $23-million loan to a company that tanked. Tens of
millions more was channeled into venture capital investments that
withered in the dot-com collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the bank say the high-tech venture capital program
created almost no jobs for the low-income residents the bank aims to
serve, because the companies required highly skilled workers.
Furthermore, the companies were in the heart of downtown, outside the
bank's target neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Dot-coms don't employ anybody in South-Central L.A.," said Bruce
Dobb, who represents several manufacturing businesses that have
applied for loans from the bank and "simply can't get their loans
reviewed."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the City Council on Tuesday, Dobb advocated shutting
down the bank immediately, not giving it more time to right itself.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Lee Romney contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Several major airlines--including American, Northwest Airlines Corp.,
Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental Airlines Inc.--have cut many of
their most expensive, unrestricted business fares 15% to 20%, a move
Northwest said Tuesday was the first reduction in the controversial
fares in perhaps a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The cheaper prices are welcome news for business travelers, who
have been howling for years about the high cost of last-minute,
walk-up seats. With the economy weak and companies slashing travel
budgets, a growing number of business fliers are opting to buy
cheaper fares with advance reservations, or not fly at all.</LD>
<LD>   That's a huge reason the big airlines continue to suffer massive
losses; the industry lost more than $1.4 billion in this year's
second quarter. Because they typically pay more than leisure
travelers who book well in advance, business customers generate most
of an airline's revenue.</LD>
<TE>   American, the world's largest carrier and a unit of AMR Corp.,
quietly initiated the cuts Friday by offering them through a select
number of travel agencies. After Northwest learned of the reductions,
"our response was to match the discounts, but in a way that the
tickets could be sold by any travel agency, not just a select group,"
Northwest spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest then cut the fares even further, which American matched.
The cuts take effect immediately and apply to travel from now until
June. Northwest's round-trip walk-up fare from Los Angeles to Miami
fell nearly 20% from $2,344 to $1,896, excluding fees and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Delta and Continental said they matched the lower fares on many
routes where they compete with the other two carriers. United
Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp. and a leading carrier for business
travel, said it was "monitoring" the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said it appeared that American--by making its
initial cuts through certain travel agencies instead of across the
board with fanfare--was maneuvering to get a jump on Northwest and
others to gain market share, rather than luring business travelers on
a large scale.</TE>
<TE>   But Kevin Mitchell, head of the Business Travel Coalition, an
advocacy group for business passengers, said American's lower walk-up
fares appeared aimed at small and medium-sized companies that don't
typically qualify for corporate discounts. Those firms are the ones
that now are "purchasing 80% to 90% of their tickets on a restricted
basis" at fares cheaper than the unrestricted walk-up fares, he said.</TE>
<TE>   American spokesman Todd Burke said "it's not unusual for us to
offer promotions to select agencies," but he declined to provide
details of the cuts or discuss American's motivation. "For
competitive reasons, we're not going to discuss pricing strategies,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The moves by American and others heightened the industry's bid to
win back business travelers. Several smaller carriers, such as
America West and American Trans Air, a unit of ATA Holdings Corp.,
already have cut unrestricted business fares in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It's "a gigantic step in the right direction," Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys of his members have shown that a cut in published fares of
at least 20% to 25% would be needed "to get them to come back in
numbers that are even close to those we had in 2000," before business
travel plummeted, he said.</TE>
<TE>   AMR's stock rose 38 cents to $9.33 on Tuesday, while Delta climbed
$1.40 to $15, Continental edged up 14 cents to $8.95 and UAL rose 11
cents to $4.34, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Northwest gained
35 cents to $8.08 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Delta today is expected to launch a 48-hour sale with cuts of up
to as much as 75% in business and leisure fares to Europe, Latin
America and other foreign destinations for travel this fall.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the round-trip economy fare on its flight from Los
Angeles to Stuttgart, Germany, is currently $1,144, but will drop to
$660 from Sept. 5 to Oct. 31, and then to $440 from Nov. 1 to Dec.

<HD>Job Diversity a Safeguard for Region</HD>
<DH>Experts say economy could hold up in a 'double-dip'
recession</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to its variety of small to medium companies, Southern
California could hold its own or even thrive if the U.S. economy fell
into a "double-dip" recession, many economic experts and
businesspeople say.</LD>
<LD>   And they're not just whistling in the dark. The economies of the
region's six counties are poised to do better than the rest of the
nation in a downturn. Already, they are adding jobs in manufacturing,
entertainment, aerospace-defense and even the apparel industry, which
is crying out for sewing machine operators to handle a surge in
garment production in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Today's outlook for the region is in marked contrast to the early
1990s, when a decline of Defense Department budgets pushed the
Southland to the worst recession since the 1930s, with massive job
losses and declines in real estate values.</LD>
<TE>   That kind of catastrophe couldn't hit the region today, says
economist Tom Lieser of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, because of the
breadth of industries and occupations.</TE>
<TE>   "This region is not concentrated on technology, as is Northern
California, where the economy continues to suffer," Lieser says.</TE>
<TE>   Also, population growth in the Southland, an area of 20 million
residents stretching from Ventura County to the border of Mexico and
from the ocean to Riverside and San Bernardino counties, "increases
demand for home building and retail and other services," Lieser says.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the likelihood of success is based on very slim
margins. In the first half of 2002, Southern California added only
28,000 jobs to a labor force of 8.3 million--an increase of 0.3%,
according to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so close to zero, I'm afraid a national recession in
consumer spending would sink us too," says economist Esmail Adibi of
Chapman University in Orange. Yet Adibi, who doesn't think there will
be another round of recession, also notes that Southern California
would fare better than Northern California and the rest of the U.S.
if there were a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The new optimism about Southern California is based on the
region's triumph over adversity during the last decade, plus an
expanding population of young families that has created a growth
market.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic devastation of the aerospace downturn forced us to
develop new industries," says Michael Jenkins, a San Diego economic
development official. Qualcomm Inc. grew out of military technology
and sparked the rise of telecommunications firms in San Diego County.
Despite troubles in that industry worldwide, those companies survive
and continue to develop technology in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Also, sophisticated cross-border manufacturing ventures have
brought progress to San Diego as well as Tijuana and Baja California,
Jenkins says. Knowledge of materials and engineering transferred from
aerospace defense work helped to make San Diego and Orange counties
centers for the development of biomedical devices.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the rise in defense budgets after Sept. 11, aerospace
work is in a long-term upturn again. Northrop Grumman Corp. is going
to assemble components for the Joint Strike Fighter project in
Palmdale and expand its operations in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   Component suppliers, such as Ace Clearwater Enterprises Inc. of
Torrance, have invested in new equipment to prepare for such new
work.</TE>
<TE>   A small company with $24 million in annual sales and 174
employees, Ace Clearwater spent $3 million to take over an advanced
metal-forming operation from giant Honeywell International Inc. and
move the machinery to a plant it owned in Compton.</TE>
<TE>   "With this hydroforming equipment, we can compete for jobs on the
Joint Strike Fighter," says Gary Johnson, executive vice president of
Ace Clearwater.</TE>
<TE>   He credits the California Manufacturing Technology Center, a state
agency, for helping his family-owned firm adapt the factory to more
demanding work.</TE>
<TE>   Apparel, a longtime Southern California industry that has been
shrinking for decades as work moved to low-wage countries, has
experienced a resurgence since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Clothing manufacturers thought it prudent to increase production
in the Southland after the terror attacks and have continued to do so
because of concern over unrest in India and Pakistan and over new
anti-terror U.S. Customs regulations that could slow down the
movement of goods from overseas.</TE>
<TE>   But the new production has caught the industry short of
employees--specifically sewing machine operators, the basic
occupation of the garment trade. The apparel industry, which now
employs 125,000 people in the region, lost many sewing machine
operators over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they learn how to operate a machine, they can also find jobs
in food processing, furniture manufacturing and other pursuits," says
Ilse Metchek of the California Fashion Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that wages are rising and the traditionally female
trade is changing.</TE>
<TE>   "An operator with six months' experience can earn $9 to $10 an
hour," Metchek says. At American Apparel, a Los Angeles company that
makes fashion T-shirts, owner Dov Charney recently hired 400 sewers,
almost half of them male.</TE>
<TE>   Population growth is pushing the region's development eastward.
With land expensive and home prices high in Los Angeles and Orange
counties, the Inland Empire of San Bernardino and Riverside counties
continues to attract residents and industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Engineers and skilled workers are coming here now because they
can afford the houses and their companies are following, setting up
satellite offices and even new headquarters," says San
Bernardino-based economist John Husing.</TE>
<TE>   New ideas are cropping up to use the available land in the Inland
Empire--an area as large as five New England states-- as a
distribution point for all of Southern California. Domestic
automobiles from plants across the U.S. and imported cars coming in
through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach would be shipped by
train to the former George Air Force Base in Victorville.</TE>
<TE>   There they would be redirected to dealerships throughout Southern
California, thus simplifying and reducing costs, according to the
plans of Stirling Airports International, a real estate company that
is developing the former air base, which it has renamed Southern
California Logistics Airport, in collaboration with Victorville. Will
the plan succeed? Possibly, but an important point is that the
venture has the kind of scope and vision often associated with
Southern California in the old days, when optimism had yet to be
seasoned by adversity.</TE>

<HD>Dow Rebounds on Rate Rumors</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Blue chips surge 230 points and Nasdaq gains
53 as speculation mounts about a Fed cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow industrials jumped 230 points Tuesday as stocks broke out of
their three-day slump in a rally fueled by bargain hunting and
speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates to try
to reignite the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Though the market finished broadly higher, the whiplash
rebound--after three days of heavy losses--underlined the unusual
volatility of the last few weeks, which is wearying professional and
individual investors alike.</LD>
<LD>   "This rally is not necessarily a sign that the market is off to
the moon," said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at St. Louis
brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "We're going to have to get used to
moves 200 or 300 points in either direction."</LD>
<TE>   Some investment pros see the recent wild swings in stocks as a
sign that the market is in the process of bottoming. Extreme price
moves often have occurred at the tail ends of major market cycles.</TE>
<TE>   Others caution that stocks will be susceptible to sharp swings for
the foreseeable future, while, as Freeman put it, "bulls and bears
fight it out over the economy and stock valuations."</TE>
<TE>   The market surged early Tuesday and held at high levels, then sold
off in the final hour, trimming the Dow Jones industrial average's
gain from as much as 375 points. It finished up 230.46 points, or
2.9%, at 8,274.09.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index rallied more strongly, gaining 53.54
points, or 4.4%, to 1,259.55, though it also faded late in the
session. The tech-heavy index had fallen 10.3% in the previous four
sessions, to a five-year low Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 24.97 points, or 3%, to
859.57 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   One spark for the rally was a report by brokerage Lehman Bros.
predicting that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark short-term
interest rate to 1% by year's end, from 1.75% now. Fed policymakers
meet Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman's report added to a growing chorus of calls from Wall
Street for the Fed to take action to bolster the faltering economic
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But trading volume Tuesday remained well below recent peaks,
suggesting a lack of conviction in the rally, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of market breadth, the session was nearly the exact
reverse of Monday: Winners outnumbered losers by about 3 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange and by 12 to 5 on Nasdaq on Tuesday. Those
were the same ratios by which losers had topped winners Monday, when
the Dow slumped 3.2% and Nasdaq dropped 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's recent gyrations suggest that many of the players in
the market have very short-term time horizons.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts blame computer-program traders, hedge funds and
"short" sellers for the volatility surge. Computerized trading
programs triggered by key indexes' moves above certain levels
accounted for 125 points of the Dow's late drop Tuesday, for example,
according to data firm HL Camp &amp; Co. of Palm Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that short-term players may add to the market's
velocity but that the main cause of volatility--and quickly fading
rallies--is widespread uncertainty among portfolio managers.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund managers in particular are leery of making heavy new
commitments to stocks, fearing another redemption wave by individual
investors, experts say. Investors yanked a record net $50 billion
from stock funds in July, according to one estimate.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, fund managers don't want to miss out if the
market is in fact turning, analysts say. So they may be quicker to
join in, albeit with smaller sums, when stocks rally--and quicker to
exit as well.</TE>
<TE>   In an indication of how severe the market's volatility has become,
in the three sessions ended Tuesday the Dow swung an average of 4.7%
between its low and high each day, according to Ned Davis Research of
Venice, Fla. In the last year, by comparison, the average daily swing
was 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts say the volatility is good news. "As the market
picks up downside speed, high volatility becomes the norm," said Tim
Hayes, equity strategist at Ned Davis. "That's what you typically see
at or near the end of the decline."</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said the Dow saw a dramatic surge in volatility in the
three-day period ended July 24, with an average daily swing of
7.5%--the highest since 1987. After spikes of such magnitude, the Dow
has been an average of 24% higher a year later, Hayes said. There
were 12 such occurrences since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Ferro, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investments in
Charlotte, N.C., said the sharp rallies are a sign value shoppers are
starting to assert themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors with a strategic view are sensing bargains," he said,
pointing to billionaire Warren Buffett's recent investments in the
natural gas industry and the surge in companies pledging to buy back
their own shares.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. blue-chip gainers included GE, up $1.35 to $29.65; J.P.
Morgan Chase, up $1.30 to $23.65; and Wal-Mart, up $1.68 to $47.28.</TE>
<TE>   * European and Latin American markets followed Wall Street higher.
Key indexes rose 7.1% in Germany, 5.4% in France, 3.4% in Britain and
3.9% in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   * Fannie Mae fell $1.50 to $71.51 and Freddie Mac lost $1.31 to
$59.70 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the mortgage buyers, predicting
a slowdown in growth.</TE>

<HD>Second Brother Dies for Dream</HD>
<DH>Crime: They were killed in separate incidents after
remaining in their adopted U.S. despite fear of hate crimes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and JOHN GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When Sukhpal Singh Sodhi left his native India eight years ago for a
job driving a cab here, his brother, who had done the same, warned
him there was a trade-off. Yes, the money was good. But there also
was danger in cruising the streets alone at night.</LD>
<LD>   Now, both brothers are dead--one the victim of an Arizona hate
crime after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the other felled early
Sunday here by what police believe was a random bullet.</LD>
<LD>   The killings, nearly one year apart, have rocked an extended
family of Indian immigrants who insisted that America was the best
place for them, even when their relatives sensed danger and pleaded
with them to return home.</LD>
<TE>   The family's painful saga began last year when gas station owner
Balbir Singh Sodhi became the first to die in a series of nationwide
attacks on Arab-looking people. The 49-year-old, who wore a
traditional Sikh turban, was shot as he checked new landscaping
outside his business in suburban Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The killing of his 50-year-old brother, Sukhpal, last weekend has
once more tested the family's strength and its commitment to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only question I have: 'Why our family?' I asked God
that question, but God never answered me," said Lakhwinder Singh
Sodhi, one of three surviving brothers who, after years of struggle
and saving, have built several successful businesses in Phoenix. "Who
could answer that question? Nobody.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows that it's dangerous driving a cab. But when your
time comes, it comes," he added. "We thought Balbir was safe [in
Phoenix], but he wasn't safe. He was killed standing on a street
corner. Death will come to you anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, death came to his brother, Sukhpal, just before 4
a.m. Sunday. It was just minutes before the end of another 12-hour
shift in his cab.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Sodhi was shot while driving in the city's Mission
District, in a gritty neighborhood where gangs and drugs are common.
His cab hit two parked cars and a power pole before coming to a stop.
Police are investigating reports of shots being fired in the area
about that time.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and fellow cabbies said Sodhi, a quiet, lumbering man who
weighed more than 240 pounds, was not wearing his turban when he was
shot.</TE>
<TE>   But Lakhwinder Sodhi fears his brother, who was found with $322 in
his pocket, may have been killed for the same reason Balbir was
gunned down last year: hate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not over," he said. "I'm still facing the same thing in my
gas station. It happened to me again two weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   Four teenagers entered Sodhi's Phoenix convenience store, bought
some items, and then shouted at him: "Bin Laden, go back to your
country!"</TE>
<TE>   Stunned but not surprised, Sodhi handed them a brochure that
explained the Sikh religion.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'I'm sorry. We didn't understand.' "</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, veteran cab drivers say they doubt Sukhpal Sodhi
was murdered in a hate crime. They think he was shot because he was
working a dangerous area at the most perilous time of night.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood at 24th and Mission streets where Sodhi was shot
is near "Heroin Alley," a drug marketplace where murders are common.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time of night, I wouldn't go there for any reason, not
even inside a police car," said Ted Thrani, a manager at United Cab,
where Sodhi worked. "This is not a hate crime. This is just a rough
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hybells, general manager at National Cab, on whose
dispatcher Sodhi often relied for calls, cried Tuesday when talking
about the killing. Balbir Sodhi once drove a cab for him.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me a watch one Christmas," he said. "Those Indian guys
are the salt of the Earth. The cab business couldn't run without
them."</TE>
<TE>   Even before Sept. 11, many Indian and Pakistani drivers reported
being harassed, Hybells said.</TE>
<TE>   "They get the finger, mostly from morons so unsophisticated they
don't know an Arab from an Indian. They see a turban and think
terrorist," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cab driver Hamby Bushar, 29, an Egyptian native who has driven a
San Francisco taxi for less than six weeks, already knows the cold
stare of a stranger. He watches as many passengers look at his
identification photo and strain to read his name, as though doing the
calculations of his ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I'm almost afraid to speak because my accent is a
giveaway," he said. "Americans are still angry after the terrorist
attacks. Who knows who might contemplate some act of revenge against
anyone who even looks like a foreigner? Even a cabdriver."</TE>
<TE>   Sukhpal Sodhi, who left a wife and three adult children in India,
understood the risks and planned to get out from behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me after Balbir's death every night. He said,
'Sometimes I am afraid,' " Lakhwinder said.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers last chatted about six hours before Sunday's
shooting. Sukhpal talked about wanting to arrange marriages for his
two daughters--the traditional way. They talked about their business
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sukhpal gave Lakhwinder $20,000--his life savings,
money he earned by piling one 12-hour day on top of another. The
brothers planned to invest in another gas station. In six months,
Sukhpal would move out of the Daly City apartment he shared with two
men and go to Arizona to be with family.</TE>
<TE>   After Balbir's murder last year, his parents came to the United
States to attend a memorial service that attracted more than 4,000
mourners.</TE>
<TE>   Lakhwinder Sodhi said the mother and father pleaded with the
brothers to move back to India.</TE>
<TE>   "They pushed me a lot. They said, 'You are not safe here,' " he
said. "We told them that this is the best country. We have
businesses. Our kids go to school here. We have bonded with this
country."</TE>
<TE>   This time, his parents won't be coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Two sons they lost in America," Sodhi said. "I haven't spoken to
them. But I know they will say, 'We told you to come back.' I don't
know how I will answer them."</TE>

<DH>Crime: Ex-principal in Thousand Oaks molestation case now
accused of assaulting two Los Angeles girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Christian middle school principal accused of molesting a
13-year-old female student this summer was arrested Tuesday at the
Ventura County Courthouse on suspicion of molesting two other girls
in Los Angeles County in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, who appeared in Ventura County Superior
Court for a scheduled arraignment, was led away in handcuffs on an
arrest warrant filed Friday in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   The new complaint alleges that Andreas, who taught in Los Angeles
before joining Oaks Christian School in Westlake Village two years
ago, molested the girls from Jan. 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001. The
complaint did not indicate whether the girls, both under age 14, were
his students.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles complaint charges Andreas with eight felony counts
of lewd conduct with a child and two misdemeanor counts of child
molestation, according to Jane Robison, spokeswoman for the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office. Bail was set at $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas will be transferred to Los Angeles County, where he will
be arraigned Thursday on the new charges, his attorney, Robert
Schwartz, said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ventura County case, Andreas is accused of molesting a
Thousand Oaks girl whose family he had befriended. On Tuesday,
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley added one count of
possessing child pornography to Andreas' 15 felony counts of child
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley also proposed adding more sentencing penalties to the
complaint, which means Andreas could face 52 years to life in prison
if convicted on all counts.</TE>
<TE>   His arraignment in Ventura County was postponed, for the second
time, and is now set for Aug. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the new allegations in the Los Angeles warrant, Ridley
also asked that Andreas' bail be increased to $1 million. Andreas was
released on $250,000 bail July 25 after Ventura County Superior Court
Judge Kevin J. McGee reduced the amount from $500,000. McGee agreed
to review Andreas' bail amount on Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Judge] McGee made a decision based upon the assumption
that there was only one victim," Ridley said. "But now there's been a
substantial change."</TE>
<TE>   Andreas allegedly wrote love letters to the Thousand Oaks girl and
told her parents he wanted to marry her, according to a search
warrant issued by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.
Investigators confiscated love letters, computer equipment and a
Bible from Andreas' Thousand Oaks apartment, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the warrant, Andreas began tutoring the girl in May
and developed a friendship with the family. The alleged incidents
occurred from June 21 to July 1 while Andreas was on a trip with the
teen's family, at the girl's home, and at Andreas' apartment.</TE>
<TE>   While on the trip, the warrant states, Andreas wrote a note to the
girl on his laptop computer. After learning of the alleged sexual
encounters, the girl's father confronted Andreas, who replied that he
loved the teenager and wanted to marry her, according to the
document.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas was fired from Oaks Christian after his July 20 arrest.</TE>

<HD>Avian Botulism Changes Balance</HD>
<DH>Machado Lake: An outbreak reduced the number of nonnative
birds, but also made native species shy away from breeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First fish were found, then dead birds started littering the waters
and banks of Machado Lake.</LD>
<LD>   Just as the outbreak peaked in mid-July, the mystery killer of
hundreds of ducks, coots and other wildlife at Ken Malloy Harbor
Regional Park was identified: avian botulism.</LD>
<LD>   It left one of Los Angeles' most diverse park habitats missing
certain native and nonnative bird species.</LD>
<TE>   After the worst die-off in at least four decades, park officials
and advocates said they would recognize the effects of another
botulism outbreak more quickly and thus be able to contain it better
by treating the sick birds right away.</TE>
<TE>   Although the outbreak solved the lake's overpopulation problem, it
also ruined this year's breeding season, said longtime park advocate
Mitch Heindel. Many native birds quit nesting when botulism started
killing their young.</TE>
<TE>   At Machado Lake, a combination of environmental and behavioral
factors probably caused the outbreak. Namely, humans' misguided
belief that feeding ducks moldy bread is good for the birds, and the
ducks' unblinking willingness to accept a free meal.</TE>
<TE>   To birds, Los Angeles looks like a big-box store parking lot:
gray, expansive and with few open spots to park. Then there's Harbor
Regional Park's 241 acres at Vermont Avenue and Pacific Coast
Highway, across the street from Kaiser Permanente's Harbor City
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   It is the pit stop of choice for migratory birds passing through
Los Angeles, local Audubon Society founder Jess Morton said--and
before the outbreak, for hundreds of feral ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone sees the duck demise as a bad thing. Heindel, a
member of the park's advisory board, is glad many of the park's
nonnative ducks are gone.</TE>
<TE>   The park's master plan, which still must be approved by the city's
Recreation and Parks Commission, called for the removal of all
nonnative birds. Removal, often a synonym for euthanasia, isn't
popular among Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, efforts to kill 275 Venice canal ducks were stymied by
public outcry. Twenty of those ducks, with human help, ended up in
Machado Lake, Heindel said.</TE>
<TE>   By this summer, the lake's nonnative duck population had swelled
to 300, helped by reproduction and the dumping of birds bought as
pets.</TE>
<TE>   That many birds on the lake ruins water quality, Heindel said. A
single duck can produce a pound of excrement a day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Machado Lake is fed exclusively by water from the
Wilmington Drain, which collects most of the street run-off from
surrounding neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Poor water quality, too much fecal matter, high temperatures and
displaced silt can cause botulism outbreaks, said Jeannie Magis,
rehabilitation manager of the International Bird Rescue and Research
Center in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   After the bacteria bloom, fish die first, she said. Then maggots
carry the disease. Birds that eat tainted fish or maggots become
infected.</TE>
<TE>   The more maggots the birds eat, the sicker they get. They become
glassy-eyed, droopy headed and then paralyzed, she said. Within a
day, if untreated, the birds die.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hayes, the park's recreation director, said it became apparent
June 7 that something was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife scientists tested the water and took bird and fish
corpses for testing. The water temperature in some places was 80
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   For a month, Hayes and others waited for autopsy results as park
workers tried to control the outbreak. The park never received the
results because the specimens were lost, Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Magis, who immediately recognized the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, most of the birds already had perished. Magis nursed
a few birds back to health, but by then the lake's eastern shore was
home to more pigeons than native birds or ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite poor water quality, Machado Lake remains a thriving
habitat, home to about 325 bird species. With botulism dormant again,
several problems remain. Improving water quality is a priority. So is
educating people about the park.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes said crews are putting up more signs warning people not to
feed the birds. A bigger problem than children bringing bread crumbs
to the lake are bakeries and tortilla factories dumping moldy bread
on its shore, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Heindel stood on the water's edge recently, surveying what birds
remained. He raised his binocular often, marveling at the variety of
birds that skim the waters or nest in the reeds.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged the lake's shifted balance. The banks are emptier.
Many birds have stopped nesting for the season, he said.</TE>

<HD>Even Worse Budget Woes Predicted</HD>
<DH>Spending: With this year's plan stalled in Legislature,
officials say scrapping programs, jobs may be the only way to plug
gap next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Assembly Democrats struggled to gain passage of an overdue budget
by proposing a massive tobacco tax increase, a letter sent to state
agencies warns that layoffs, program eliminations and agency
overhauls may be necessary to balance next year's spending plan.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, prepared by officials at the state Department of
Finance, underscores the gloomy fiscal conditions that have
contributed to a $23.6-billion budget gap and to analysts' forecasts
of five more years of multibillion-dollar budget shortfalls. It also
reflects the fact that state officials have already tapped many of
the more attractive deficit-shrinking options, such as loans and
transfers, to close this year's gap.</LD>
<LD>   "It is expected that reductions for the 2003-04 budget will be
more complex, [and] require the elimination of programs or layoff of
employees," Finance Director Tim Gage warned in the letter.</LD>
<TE>   To gain passage of the 2002-03 budget, now more than a month
overdue, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) on Tuesday
proposed more than tripling California's cigarette tax to $3 per
pack--the highest of any state in the nation. He also outlined a plan
to levy a 5% tax on satellite television services to raise $55
million.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson floated the hefty tobacco tax increase to replace a
proposal to more than double vehicle license fees, which has proved
widely unpopular among legislators of both parties. Republicans are
calling for spending cuts and Democrats prefer an alternative
proposal to tax the rich.</TE>
<TE>   Republican opposition to new taxes to balance the state's books
has given rise to the prolonged standoff over the $99-billion
spending package, which was supposed to take effect July 1. Wesson
said studies show that when tobacco taxes are raised 10% or more,
smoking declines by 4%, suggesting the tax increase would be good
public policy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only tax that saves lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no drill," Wesson later warned Republicans. "We will stay
here until Christmas. We will fight for this budget."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would permanently raise the state's tax of 87 cents
per package to $3--an amount levied only by New York City. In
California, the higher tax would be projected to raise $1.7 billion,
which when combined with another plan to borrow against the state's
share of the national tobacco litigation settlement means the state
would be relying on tobacco-related funds to solve about one-fourth
of its $23.6-billion budget hole.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats had previously sought a 63-cent increase on cigarettes
to raise $650 million. Wesson said he is comfortable raising more
money from smokers to get the state out of the red, as are Gov. Gray
Davis and Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   "Could I vote for a cigarette tax instead of a [vehicle license
fee increase]? Yeah," Burton said. "But the question is: Are we going
to get the bill?"</TE>
<TE>   Assembly lawmakers voted 50 to 23 to make the changes to the tax
package, but did not take a follow-up vote Tuesday on the amended
spending plan. A vote could come as soon as Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) said his caucus is pleased
that Democrats have agreed to drop their plan to increase vehicle
license fees--a move he described as a good start. But he warned
that, given the threat of future deficits, cuts are needed to garner
Republican support for the spending package.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell also questioned Democrats' contention that the tobacco
tax can save lives and balance the budget.</TE>
<TE>   "If smoking drops off, the state's position becomes worse,"
Campbell said. "So if you don't smoke, the state is in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats contend that their revenue projections take into
consideration a decline in smoking triggered by the higher tobacco
tax. Tobacco officials warned that the tax increase would drive sales
to other sources, such as the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be a disaster for California's small businesses," said
Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A.</TE>
<TE>   "It will also place an unforeseen burden on a small group of the
population."</TE>
<TE>   Californians between the ages of 18 and 24, young working-class
Asians and working-class whites continue to have higher smoking rates
than other groups, meaning they could be the hardest hit by the tax
increase.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the tobacco and satellite television taxes, the
Democrats' proposed revenue package also steps up withholding for
stock options and bonuses. Schools would receive an extra $481
million under the latest tax plan.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have called for a spending limit to stave off future
deficits and the tax increases they fear Democrats will seek to close
them.</TE>
<TE>   State tax collections for May and June are running $650 million
below forecast, causing some budget watchers to predict that the
$9.8-billion gap projected for next year will more likely range from
$12 billion to $15 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The July 31 letter from Gage to agency heads and department
directors warns that no money is expected in the 2003-04 fiscal year
for new programs or expansion of existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   State agencies and departments, which have already seen their
budgets cut by 5% to 25%, are trying to digest an order from the
Legislature to eliminate 6,000 vacant positions to save $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Gage warned in the letter that his department anticipates the need
for additional cuts and that agencies and departments should be
prepared to submit reduction plans like the ones they turned in last
year.</TE>

<HD>Courses Help Students Master Entertainment Law</HD>
<DH>Southwestern is offering new graduate-level classes in such
specialties as music publishing. Industry professionals are lending
their expertise.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lawyers' glares and rolling eyes belied the fact that the
passionate negotiations for a songwriter's new contract were only a
teaching exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The would-be contract required him to record and release 12
recordings on a major label each year.</LD>
<LD>   "Impossible," said his lawyer, Chris Crosby, scratching out
paragraphs. "And this 10% administration fee? I don't think so."</LD>
<TE>   But he looked mollified when Jeff Brabec, representing
Westmoreland Music Co., grudgingly agreed to delete the fee, asking
in return that Crosby accede to the recording schedule. Then Brabec
turned to his audience, a group of 20 law students furiously
scribbling notes onto copies of the contract, and grinned.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times I put a clause like that in just so I can take it
out and put in something else and still look like the good guy," he
said. "That's what you're dealing with in this business--snakes like
me."</TE>
<TE>   As the class laughed, the two shook hands and agreed on the deal.
The contract and the artist were fictional, but Crosby and Brabec
were real industry professionals attending a Southwestern Law School
class as guests of professor Michael Perlstein.</TE>
<TE>   Mock contract negotiations like that during a law school class on
music publishing are part of Southwestern's effort to corner the
market in entertainment law education.</TE>
<TE>   This fall the university will start offering the country's first
advanced degree in entertainment law for law school graduates,
according to the American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Students in law school have limited slots available for electives,
if their schools even offer any in the fields they're interested in,
but LL.M. (master of laws) programs provide opportunities to take
nearly a dozen specialized classes. In Southwestern's new program,
students will be able to enroll in such courses as sports law,
entertainment industry labor law, defamation and the music publishing
class.</TE>
<TE>   The new program will be Southwestern's first LL.M., although other
law schools offer masters in such subjects as taxation--the most
popular--finance, energy, agriculture and ocean law.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Landis will be among the 15 members of Southwestern's first
LL.M. class. Currently a partner at a media research firm, she
graduated from Southwestern in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Those courses weren't even offered when I was in law school,"
said Landis, 39, who hopes to parlay the degree into a position at a
newspaper or television network. "Now I have the opportunity to take
all of them and get a jump start in my career."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent summer session of the music publishing course, Brabec
and Cosby negotiated two mock contracts: one to sign an artist and
another to purchase rights to a song. Brabec is the business affairs
vice president at Chrysalis Music Group USA, which represents artists
such as Paul Anka and Outkast, and Cosby is a Century City attorney
whose firm's clients have included Virgin Records and Bob Dylan.</TE>
<TE>   Learning about industry customs allows lawyers to be productive
from the beginning of their careers rather than trying to cram on
terminology and case law, Perlstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "We bring the day-to-day deal-making apparatus that you don't get
in a course in pure copyright law," said Perlstein, a partner in the
same Century City entertainment firm as Cosby. "My course is intended
to talk the talk."</TE>
<TE>   Several of those enrolled in the class are interested in
eventually pursuing master's degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Getting experience with industry practices was the goal for Howard
University law student Willie Thomas when he came for the summer to
Southwestern to take Perlstein's class and serve as an intern at an
organization for black sports agents. After finishing at Howard next
year, he said, he might return for the LL.M. program.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other students in Perlstein's class, he said the course
is teaching him what a music lawyer deals with on a daily basis:
looking over contracts, understanding the negotiation process and
trying to figure out what's most advantageous for his clients.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas said the class has taken him far beyond what his law school
can provide.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of law schools don't take entertainment law seriously,"
said Thomas, 23. "When you're out in L.A., people understand that
this is a billion-dollar industry."</TE>
<TE>   Like Thomas, Marcus Hunt is taking the music publishing course and
will consider the LL.M. program once he graduates in a year from law
school at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   "I really want to have the biggest advantage over anyone who's
just coming out of law school," said Hunt, 27. "Something that would
set me way apart from anybody else is to have a master's in
entertainment law."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 30 LL.M. applicants said the prospect of strengthening
their credentials is driving their interest in the program, said Anne
Wilson, Southwestern's admissions director.</TE>
<TE>   "Jobs are harder to get in this economy, so people in general are
looking for a higher degree" than a general law degree, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The degree is designed to be finished in one year, if classes are
taken full time, and about two otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica attorney Charles B. Rosenberg, who will teach
entertainment law this fall at Pepperdine University's law school,
said he doesn't think an advanced entertainment law degree is
necessary if law students take classic industry courses such as
intellectual property. However, he added that the Southwestern
program should improve students' understanding of business practices
in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that most law school courses don't really teach a lot
about is how deals are really made," said Rosenberg, the technical
legal advisor for the TV series "The Practice." "An LL.M. program
could really get into the nuts and bolts of the industry."</TE>
<TE>   He added that an entertainment law program may follow the
evolution of tax law degrees, which were once nonexistent and now are
offered at about 25 law schools in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Presumably the proliferation of those programs has raised the
floor for the kind of education you need for a good entry-level tax
job," Rosenberg said. "It may turn out that entertainment companies
look more favorably on those who don't have to start learning about
the industry from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   When Brabec of Chrysalis got his first job, his industry education
consisted solely of reading files he found around the office.</TE>
<TE>   "Working in the music industry is a dream for many people, but
they walk into their first jobs knowing nothing but the basics," he
said. "Schools should at least include something about the real life
you're going to face when you leave school."</TE>

<HD>Judge Halts City's Bid for Church Land</HD>
<DH>Courts: Cypress' attempt to seize Cottonwood property for a
Costco is temporarily blocked.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a stinging 36-page opinion, a federal judge Tuesday ordered a
temporary halt to the city of Cypress' plan to condemn church
property in order to make way for a tax-generating Costco.</LD>
<LD>   "The framers of the Constitution ... might be surprised to learn
that the power of eminent domain was being used to turn the property
over to a private discount retail corporation," U.S. District Court
Judge David O. Carter wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling in favor of Cottonwood Christian Center's request for a
preliminary injunction is the first peek at the judge's leanings in a
national test case that weighs a city's redevelopment rights against
a church's free exercise of religion.</LD>
<TE>   In issuing the injunction, the judge said the 4,000-member
megachurch has demonstrated a "likelihood of success" in its lawsuit,
filed in January, against the city. He concluded that both major
prongs of the church's legal argument had merit: that the city lacked
a "compelling state interest" to condemn Cottonwood's 18 acres of
vacant property near the Los Alamitos Race Course for a private
interest, and that the city had infringed on the church's freedom of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if [the city] had compelling reasons to burden Cottonwood's
religious exercise, they must do so in the least restrictive means,"
Carter said. "Far from doing that, the city has done the equivalent
of using a sledgehammer to kill an ant."</TE>
<TE>   City officials downplayed the significance of the judge's order,
saying they already have voluntarily suspended condemnation
proceedings while trying to work out a land swap with Cottonwood.
They also said the issues will be raised again when the church's
lawsuit against the city goes to trial, which is scheduled for March.</TE>
<TE>   "What this does is perpetuate the status quo," City Atty. William
Wynder said. "The next step is getting this case to trial."</TE>
<TE>   But Cottonwood attorney Kevin J. Hasson said the ruling will have
far-reaching implications.</TE>
<TE>   "In the bigger picture, this sends a signal across the nation that
it's not right to take a church's property," said Hasson, president
of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington-based group
that concentrates on religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been fighting for nearly two years over
property at the corner of Walker Street and Katella Avenue, the
busiest intersection in the city's 300-acre redevelopment zone.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood officials, seeking a new home for the expanding
congregation in neighboring Los Alamitos, paid $13 million for the
land in 1999. In October 2000, city officials rejected the church's
plans for the site, indicating they preferred office towers. More
recently, they decided they wanted a Costco on the lot.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood filed a federal suit in January, accusing the city of
discriminatory practices for stopping the church's plans in favor of
businesses that would provide the city with tax dollars. In May, the
church sought a temporary injunction in federal court after the City
Council unanimously voted to condemn the church's land.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Carter said he found Cypress' stated reasons for
taking the action--eliminating blight and generating tax
revenue--dubious.</TE>
<TE>   "At first blush, the city's concern about blighting rings hollow,"
Carter said, asking why the city didn't clean up the property for
more than a decade if this were the case. "Although some innocent
explanations are feasible--such as new leadership or robust economic
growth--the activity suggests that the city was simply trying to keep
Cottonwood out of the city, or at least from the use of its own
land."</TE>
<TE>   He also called the city's revenue concerns "even more suspect than
the concerns of blight," adding that Cypress has a 25% budget
surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's ruling pleased advocates of religious freedom, especially
for his citing of a religious land use act passed by Congress in 2000
to criticize the city's decision to seize the land. Also heartened
were constitutional conservatives who believe local government has
become too bold in taking private property to boost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling is big because it continues a major trend of courts
starting to refuse to rubber-stamp redevelopment confiscations," said
Harold E. Johnson, an attorney with the Sacramento-based Pacific
Legal Foundation, a public interest firm that specializes in property
and individual rights. "When government's motive is merely to
transfer land to a favored developer or to fatten the government's
coffers, a condemnation action doesn't cut it constitutionally."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Laycock, a University of Texas law professor who
specializes in religious freedom, said: "This is pretty significant
because two constitutional issues are at stake: freedom of religion
and the proper use of eminent domain. There haven't been that many
cases like this and that's led to a widespread attitude with
government officials who believe churches exist [only with] their
permission."</TE>
<TE>   Cypress Councilman Tim Keenan said city officials haven't received
credit for agreeing to "a major concession. We are willing to take
the church into our community and we are willing to take more than 18
acres off our tax rolls."</TE>
<TE>   He also vowed to seek an out-of-court solution with Cottonwood,
the most promising being a land exchange involving property near the
Los Alamitos racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, clearly," Keenan said. "The judge worked hard,
but I don't think he got it. But we're committed to a negotiated
settlement, and I hope the church doesn't use this for political
gain."</TE>
<TE>   John Shirey, executive director of the California Redevelopment
Assn. in Sacramento, said the case is unique because a church is
involved and likely won't affect many redevelopment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "What should not be lost here is the impetus behind this whole
effort: local governments in this state trying to sustain themselves
and ... meet the unending demands of their citizens," he said.</TE>

<HD>The Strawberry Once Again Is King in Ventura County</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Juicy red fruit edges out lemons for second
time in three years. Crop figures should keep county in state's top
10.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County strawberries again overtook lemons to become the
region's premier crop in 2001 as local growers realized a third
consecutive year of sales exceeding $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The total value of fruits, nuts, vegetables, plants, livestock and
other agricultural production reached $1.05 billion last year, up
nearly $6.6 million from production totals the previous year,
according to county agricultural statistics released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this was a so-so year overall. But for a so-so year, we
did mighty well," said Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail. "If
not for strawberries and nursery stock [gains], the crop report would
have probably been down significantly."</LD>
<TE>   The overall figures underscore Ventura County's status as one of
the leading agricultural regions in California. McPhail estimates
that when statewide crop figures are released, the county will rank
in the top 10. In 2000, the county held 10th place behind such
counties as Fresno, Tulare, Monterey and Kern.</TE>
<TE>   Local growers of strawberries, potted plants and ornamental trees
and shrubs saw substantial increases in their harvests on average,
while those who farm lemons, grapefruit and vegetables--including
carrots, cucumbers, celery, lettuce and spinach--mostly saw a decline
in revenues, production, or both.</TE>
<TE>   "For the second time in some 50 years, lemons were not the top
crop," McPhail said. "But we think they will rebound."</TE>
<TE>   After dominating county crop statistics for decades, the gross
value of local lemons sold last year fell to $173.67 million, down
about 7.2% from $187.16 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The decline came despite increases in the amount of land
harvested--up 361 acres to 25,864 last year--and the number of lemons
picked. Last year's lemon production hit 490,969 tons, up 15,544 tons
from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   McPhail explained that more lemons available in supermarkets
pushed down the average price by more than 10% to $353.74 per ton. By
contrast, strawberry prices leaped nearly $151 per ton, up 15.7% to
$1,111.02.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 186 acres were dedicated to the juicy red berries
and more fruit was harvested per acre last year, allowing local
growers to sell 207,646 tons of strawberries for a total value of
$230.69 million, compared with 194,330 tons sold in 2000, valued at
$186.60 million.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Pidduck, who grows lemons and avocados in Santa Paula and
Oxnard, said a combination of factors hurt lemon sales in 2001--poor
weather, a decline in global demand for lemon juice and stiff
competition from overseas during the summer sales season.</TE>
<TE>   But ideal weather in 2002, along with a continued suspension of
Argentine citrus imports coming into the United States, are turning
things around, Pidduck maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is shaping up very well," he said. "The overall crop is
slightly smaller, but the quality is better." Although an oversupply
of lemons depressed prices last year, increased strawberry production
has met with an unsated consumer demand, according to Dominique
Hansen, a spokeswoman for the California Strawberry Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County is already the No. 2 region in California for
strawberry production behind Watsonville and Salinas in Santa Cruz
County.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of acreage dedicated to berries continues to rise
because of the fruit's profitability, Hansen said.</TE>

<HD>Reluctant Deputies OK New Contract</HD>
<DH>Labor: The deal includes a pay raise but does not guarantee
future increases or provide the more generous pensions that had been
sought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County sheriff's deputies Tuesday ratified a new labor pact
that includes a 13.5% pay increase but leaves out guaranteed future
raises and substantially increased pension benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Glen Kitzmann, president of the Ventura County Deputy Sheriff's
Assn., said a majority of the union's 800 members reluctantly voted
to accept the three-year contract. He declined to give specific
numbers but said the approval vote "was not overwhelming."</LD>
<LD>   "Even those that voted in favor are not real happy," Kitzmann
said. "They just know this is all they are going to get out of the
county right now. Basically, it gets a little bit of money in their
pocket and we will go from there."</LD>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the contract Sept.
10 when it returns from a monthlong recess.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's agreement is seen as a resounding victory for
supervisors and County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston, who held
firm in rejecting increased pension and automatic raises, despite
intense political pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Kitzmann and more than 200 deputies packed a supervisors' meeting
in June 2001, calling the county's offer "a personal insult to every
one of us." Sheriff Bob Brooks also urged supervisors to find a way
to end the impasse.</TE>
<TE>   The union unsuccessfully targeted Supervisor Judy Mikels for
defeat in last spring's primary election, walking door to door in
support of her challenger and picketing outside her campaign events.</TE>
<TE>   But the hardball tactics backfired once the public learned what
deputies were asking for, said Herb Gooch, political scientist at Cal
Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Many called supervisors and wrote letters to local newspapers to
say that deputies already receive a generous pension package and
urged supervisors to hold firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The union tried to politicize it as much as possible by taking on
a supervisor and they still did not get what they wanted," Gooch
said. "So it is a setback for them."</TE>
<TE>   His ability to push the contract through also confirms that
Johnston, who succeeded former county administrator Harry Hufford
just as contract negotiations were getting underway, is firmly in
control, Gooch said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came in, this was a big, hot item on the front burner,"
Gooch said. "He was able to get the board to trust him, to give him
more time and it went his way. It shows he's got his chops. He can
play."</TE>
<TE>   When contract negotiations began in November 2000, the labor
group's top priority was winning a new pension benefit that several
law enforcement agencies across the state had already secured.</TE>
<TE>   The benefit would have allowed deputies to retire at age 50 and
receive a pension that equaled 3% of their "final compensation"--the
combined value of pay and benefits--for every year of service.</TE>
<TE>   Under the formula, a long-serving deputy could retire at 50 and
receive a pension that equaled, and in some cases even exceed, his or
her active wages. Johnston said the county could not afford the
benefit package, which he estimated would cost $60 million.
Retirement pay for deputies currently is 2% of salary and benefits
per year of service.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston also urged supervisors to reject the union's demand that
deputies receive raises whenever pay for law enforcement in
surrounding counties increases. Although deputies had won such a
"parity" agreement in their previous contract, Johnston argued that
it took away supervisors' ability to set salaries. Annual salaries
for deputies currently range from $42,000 for a trainee to $65,000
for a senior deputy.</TE>
<TE>   In the contract before supervisors, deputies agreed to accept a
6.5% increase for the current fiscal year, 4% in the following year
and 3% in the final year. The contract would expire in June 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston said he doesn't view the union's ratification vote as a
personal victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to make a course correction and that is always painful for
everyone," he said. "It is not personal. It's financial."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said he is pleased his deputies will soon be getting a
raise because they had gone nearly two years without one. But the
absence of the enhanced pension benefit could hurt the county's
ability to attract top recruits to the Sheriff's Department, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president of a statewide peace officers group agreed.</TE>
<TE>   At least 205 of California's 500 law enforcement agencies already
have adopted the enhanced benefit as part of their overall pay
package, said Clancy Faria, president of Sacramento-based Peace
Officers Research Assn. of California.</TE>
<TE>   "The real concern is you are asking folks coming into your system
to work longer to earn the same benefits other agencies grant at 50,"
he said. "If you have a choice, where would you go?"</TE>

<HD>5 Injured in Blast at Sewage Plant</HD>
<DH>Accident: Workers were upgrading power vault in Huntington
Beach. One is in critical condition.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An electrical explosion and fire ripped through a power supply
building at a Huntington Beach sewage treatment plant Tuesday,
injuring five workers, one seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Five workers were upgrading a 12,000-volt electrical service
center vault about 7:20 a.m. when the blast occurred, Orange County
Sanitation District officials said. The vault distributes power to
the sanitation district facility on Brookhurst Street near Pacific
Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Posey, 49, of San Diego was attempting to connect wires to a
system that apparently had not been shut down, officials said. There
was a flash and a flame and Posey's clothes caught fire, according to
reports.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of the explosion is being investigated by the sanitation
district and Cal-OSHA.</TE>
<TE>   Posey, who suffered third-degree burns over 90% of his body, was
taken by helicopter within a half an hour to the Grossman Burn Center
at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. He was listed in critical but
stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   Another worker, Roger Webb, 60, suffered second- and third-degree
burns over 6% of his body.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday, hospital
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Thuan Nguyen, a burn specialist, and part of the team
that will be performing the operations, said Posey is "too unstable
now" to undergo reconstructive surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Workers Scott Christenson and Travis Lindbergh were taken to UCI
Medical Center in Orange with moderate and minor injuries. Phillip
Sullivan was treated for minor smoke inhalation at Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach and released.</TE>
<TE>   The plant, which processes an average of 153 million gallons of
sewage daily, lost power until backup generators kicked in, officials
said. The brief outage caused no problems, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Police closed Brookhurst to all traffic from Pacific Coast Highway
to Adams Avenue for nearly three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the square concrete building on Brookhurst said they
were unaware anything was amiss until they heard firetrucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't hear anything," said Tim Baker, who was making breakfast
for his 2-year-old son, Robbie, at the time. Baker, whose home on
Summerwind Lane is across the street from the facility, said he saw
fire engines and then a helicopter flying low over his house.</TE>

<HD>Donations Flow Before Key Vote</HD>
<DH>Senate: Mercury Insurance lavishes funds on panel members
who will decide firm's bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>One of California's largest automobile insurers showered a Senate
committee with campaign contributions just days before it was to
consider a bill the company is pushing to overturn a decision by
Insurance Commissioner Harry Low.</LD>
<LD>   Mercury Insurance Co., a Los Angeles-based insurer, is sponsoring
legislation that would allow it to continue to offer discounts to
customers who maintained insurance coverage over the years.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would strike down proposed regulations by Low that outlaw
the discount because it requires customers who have not been
previously insured to pay higher rates. Under Low's plan, customers
would only receive a "loyalty discount," which means they would get a
break if they stay with the same company but not if they switch to
another insurer.</LD>
<TE>   The Senate Insurance Committee has life and death power over the
legislation, and seven of its nine members received thousands of
dollars in contributions from Mercury, with several donations coming
just before the bill's first hearing on June 26.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is expected to pass the measure in a final vote
today despite a plea from Low that it would undermine his authority
to regulate insurance rates. Mercury's general counsel dismissed the
timing of the contributions as nothing unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "Mercury has been an active participant in the political life of
this state for many, many years," said Douglas Hallett. "I think the
fact of the matter is that Mercury regularly contributes to a number
of people in public life."</TE>
<TE>   California, unlike some other states, does not ban contributions
to lawmakers while legislation is under consideration. In 2000,
voters approved Proposition 34 after they were promised that it would
put $3,000 limits on contributions to legislators.</TE>
<TE>   But the Fair Political Practices Commission, an ethics watchdog
group that is appointed by politicians, created a loophole that
allows veteran lawmakers to collect political donations in unlimited
amounts. Among the committee members accepting donations from Mercury
was Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), who reported receiving $25,000 on
June 19.</TE>
<TE>   Recent campaign disclosure reports show other longtime legislators
have received large contributions as well. Assembly Speaker Herb
Wesson (D-Culver City) collected $30,000 from the Recording Industry
of America; Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga),
$10,000 from the Pechanga Band of Mission Indians; and Senate
President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), $25,000 from the
Wine Institute Fund, to name only a few of the large contributions.</TE>
<TE>   In Mercury's case, Burton said it was not the company's generosity
that made its bill so attractive to senators but its compelling
arguments on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Why the hell should you be locked into one insurance company if
another will give you a better rate?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Low acknowledged in a letter to the committee that many drivers
would benefit from the discount but he said it would come at the
expense of newly insured motorists, some of whom are the working poor
struggling to comply with California's mandatory automobile insurance
law.</TE>
<TE>   "While allowing a ... discount when shopping for insurance
coverage, on its face, may appear to be a competitive, consumer
friendly concept," he wrote, "the bill ... will have the unintended
deleterious effect of significantly driving up rates for those
entering the insurance market."</TE>
<TE>   Role of Prop. 103</TE>
<TE>   Low, a former judge, said it would also violate Proposition 103,
which prohibits a lack of prior insurance from being a factor in
determining premiums that should be paid by a particular driver. The
initiative, approved by voters in 1988, set stringent regulations on
insurance, including rules that require the commissioner to determine
which factors can be used in setting rates.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury's Hallett disagreed, saying Low misinterpreted the
initiative. He said the wording in that part of Proposition 103 was
modeled after laws in other states, all of which had been interpreted
to mean that companies could provide a discount to customers who
maintained insurance coverage even if they switched carriers.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that we are seeking to provide positive incentive
for people to comply with the mandatory insurance law," he said, "we
should not be putting them in a position where they're economically
disadvantaged if they choose to move from Allstate to Mercury."</TE>
<TE>   He said motorists who present less risk should be rewarded
financially and insurance company data show that those who have
coverage over extended periods of time have fewer losses than other
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103, sided with Low,
saying the commissioner's reading of the initiative was correct. He
said the effect of Mercury's legislation would be to impose a
surcharge on newly insured motorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Insurance is a zero-sum game," he said. "You get a benefit,
someone else pays more. Department of Insurance data show that in
exchange for a benefit of $38 to the previously insured, people
trying to enter the market will pay $66 more for a Mercury policy--a
$104 difference."</TE>
<TE>   He said the legislation does violate Proposition 103, which was
specifically designed to protect the previously uninsured.</TE>

<HD>Without Warning, the British Press Has Come</HD>
<DH>Media: Lord chancellor's son faces trial in Orange County,
which may never have seen the like.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The British press invaded the Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana
on Tuesday, and those in its way didn't know what hit them.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 reporters and photographers from various Fleet Street
papers charged down the narrow hallways and escalators of the
courthouse, chasing a defense attorney and an alleged crime victim
and his mother out of the building.</LD>
<LD>   "Move! Move! Move!" members of the press pack yelled as they
breathlessly pushed past bystanders.</LD>
<TE>   Even in Southern California's overheated media climate, the
British press' pursuit of the case of Alastair Irvine--a 25-year-old
stalking suspect whose father is England's top law enforcement
officer--has been stunning.</TE>
<TE>   The London Daily Mail triggered the invasion last week when it
broke the story: Irvine had been charged with stalking the boyfriend
of a tanning salon employee whom he was courting, as well as
vandalizing the man's car. He was being held in Orange County Jail,
facing up to 15 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   In response, competing British newspapers began scouring Orange
County, feeding England's seemingly insatiable appetite for any news
on "The Sins of the Son." Some papers have even offered payments of
up to $25,000 for a good scoop--especially for an interview with the
man Irvine was allegedly stalking, Karel Taska, 19.</TE>
<TE>   "When the British press gets going, [it] can be like the running
of the bulls of Pamplona," Peter Sheridan, a stringer for the Mail,
said Sunday as he stood watch at the courthouse. "The level of
competition is ferocious."</TE>
<TE>   Taska's mother, Kathy, called police over the weekend after a
group of journalists camped out in front of her Placentia home and
even followed her son around in a car.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really scary," Kathy Taska said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like this," added Tori Richards, a
spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. "This
is America, and we don't have a society where news reporters chase
down victims in their cars. The [family] is fearful of even going out
of their house or going to work."</TE>
<TE>   Media experts said the Irvine case coverage underscores the
hard-charging nature of the British tabloid press.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, the tabloids are sort of a minor sideline. In
England, they are enormously important and well entrenched," said
Bryce Nelson, a professor at USC's Annenberg School of Journalism.
"It's a much more aggressive kind of news culture, and the fact that
it's the son of a [top government official] would just increase the
thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities on Tuesday became so exasperated by the spectacle that
Richards held a press conference in which she admonished the British
press corps.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to ruin our chances of a clean trial," she told the
gathering of reporters. "Please respect our concerns."</TE>
<TE>   But the media circus shows few signs of letting up. Irvine's
arrest has been front page news in London for a week now, with
headlines like "Irvine Victim: I Fear I'll Be Killed" and "Irvine,
the Dark Star Who Failed to Shine."</TE>
<TE>   A reporter for the Mail on Sunday began a weekend feature on the
case this way: "I was given an exclusive tour of the teeming human
zoo that is Orange County Jail, the temporary home of Alastair Irvine
and one of the most notorious prisons in America. It was, frankly,
chilling. There are 5,000 convicts squeezed into this modern vision
of Bedlam."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's father is Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine, who administers
the British court system and advises on the appointment of judges.
He's one of Prime Minister Tony Blair's oldest and most trusted
advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The son, a bodybuilder and athlete, met Nicole Healy, 19, in early
June while getting a tan at the Newport Beach salon where she worked.
Several British newspapers reported that Irvine was in Orange County
after completing a stint at a drug rehab center in San Diego for
cocaine addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Irvine asked Healy about starting a romantic
relationship. She turned him down, telling Irvine she had a
boyfriend, according to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine continued bringing flowers to the shop. On June 6, he
allegedly poured an unidentified substance on the boyfriend's truck,
causing $5,700 in damage, Richards said. A few days later, Irvine
allegedly went to the woman's workplace with a gun in his belt,
threatening the life of Healy's boyfriend, Taska.</TE>
<TE>   The couple called Costa Mesa police. Detectives searched Irvine's
Newport Beach apartment and found two unlicensed handguns and some
type of caustic chemical, authorities said. He was charged in late
June with stalking, making a criminal threat, vandalism and carrying
a concealed weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine was supposed to be arraigned Tuesday, but the hearing was
postponed so his attorney, Edward Moses, could have more time to
review the case.</TE>
<TE>   Moses tried to slip out of court, but reporters spotted him,
beginning a brief chase through the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Moses eventually jumped into a private office in the courthouse.
The press entourage tried to find an exit from the office but gave up
in frustration a few minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they've been bombarded with hundreds of calls
from the British media over the last week. Richards said that a few
reporters said they were miffed that Irvine didn't face more serious
charges.</TE>
<TE>   The case has touched a chord in England not just because Irvine is
the son of the country's top lawman, but because the government is
debating whether to decriminalize marijuana. Some conservative
newspapers have cited Irvine's addiction as a reason not to
liberalize drug laws.</TE>
<TE>   The coverage has been decidedly unsympathetic to Irvine. Healy has
granted interviews to several newspapers, who quoted the "California
cheerleader" as saying she's living in fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been so frightened. My life is shattered," the Mail
on Sunday quoted her as saying. (She could not be reached for
comment.)</TE>
<TE>   Anonymous police sources have described Irvine as a "very bad boy"
who is "going down." The Observer News quoted one police official as
saying: "We know who his daddy is, and we don't give a damn."</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped by a Rapist One Day, and by TV the Next</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The local television news was on, but I wasn't paying attention,
which is often the best way to watch. I heard a young woman talking
about a kidnapping ordeal and thought it was oddly similar to the
story of the two Antelope Valley teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   Couldn't be that case, I figured. Or if it were, this teenager on
the tube couldn't have been one of the victims. She seemed too
relaxed--too comfortable in front of the camera--to have been
abducted, raped, bound, and freed only one day earlier when her
captor was shot dead in a hail of bullets.</LD>
<LD>   Besides, what parent would allow a child who'd just been the
victim of such a harrowing nightmare at the hands of so despicable a
man to talk about it on television a mere 24 hours later?</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it was yet another kidnapping case, I thought. Or maybe this
was someone from a new reality show in which contestants are abducted
at gunpoint, from a lover's point somewhere, and then try to break
free. A preposterous concept, yes. Out of the question, probably not.</TE>
<TE>   Then, upon closer listening, I realized my mistake. This was one
of the two Antelope Valley teenagers who'd been abducted.</TE>
<TE>   Although we sometimes commit our own sins of excess in the
newspaper business, we hadn't used her name in The Times because of
our policy against disclosing the identities of minors who are
victims of sex crimes. But here she was on TV, 17 years old and
sharing her story with unseen strangers, speaking with an eerie
detachment.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, she'd been through hell, and I almost wanted to go tell
her to get back in the house and slam the door on the next reporter
who came around asking for the details.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the deal for television, which so defines our
culture, is that there is no accountability for such exploitation. TV
doesn't have to admit that having cheapened women at every
opportunity, shamelessly selling titillation at a profit in the
billions, it is in no position to comfort the victims of a violent
sexual assault.</TE>
<TE>   But this unfortunate teenager was not alone in the need to
surrender all sense of privacy. She was not the only one who chose to
be heard, seen, validated.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff of Kern County was on "Larry King Live" before the
crime scene was cleared, telling the tale. Over the weekend, the
sheriff did his thing again on "Geraldo Live," calling the gunning
down of the abductor "God-driven," and eagerly explaining the
vagaries of what must be done once a suspect "goes mobile."</TE>
<TE>   The congratulatory Rivera, in fine caricature, was ready to saddle
up and ride out with the next posse.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Monday morning I turned on the TV to find that the
teenagers themselves had gone national. Flanked by parents and other
relatives, they told their story to Katie Couric on the "Today" show.
The story was chopped into segments--toothpaste or some such had to
be sold--and spun into the blender that trivializes tragedy and numbs
us all.</TE>
<TE>   During one break, Matt Lauer could only muster a curious "Hmmm"
before teasing the next segment. Maybe he's inured to tragedy by now,
or perhaps he was ashamed that however spectacular the story, 16- and
17-year-old rape victims were being exposed to all the world thanks
to "Today's" coup, which it repeatedly touted as a big "exclusive."</TE>
<TE>   "It was preposterous," former CBS News correspondent Cinny Kennard
said of the days-long spectacle. Kennard teaches ethics in journalism
at USC. "There was a day when we did have ethics; we did have
standards. We didn't go knock on the door of a rape victim and try to
get her on camera."</TE>
<TE>   In this particular case, a spokesman for the two families has been
quoted as saying they thought their story could help others caught in
the same horrifying situation. What might help, actually, is for
someone to suggest that responsible parents--no matter how
traumatized they might be--don't go on national television with their
children a few days after they've been raped.</TE>
<TE>   But this idea that there's a need to go on TV, if not an
obligation, is one of the darker aspects of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's a sense the trauma is not over until you affirm your
very existence on camera.</TE>
<TE>   "This is now part of the American ritual," Kennard says. "A jury
verdict comes in, police allegedly beat a suspect, and the next thing
is something you do just because you're supposed to do it. You go on
Larry King and then tell Katie and Matt all about it."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe part of it is knowing that Larry, Matt and Katie will never
turn you away.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got twentysomething producers being paid nothing to chase
these stories, trying to make a career out of a 'get,' " says
Kennard. "You've got to get the victim on. You've got to get the rape
suspect on. You've got to get Samantha Runnion's mother on. Whatever
you have to do, you've got to get the 'get.' "</TE>
<TE>   Discretion has been abducted in this country. Under the guise of
compassion and public service, our friends Matt and Katie delivered
teenage rape victims into our community of living rooms, and managed,
as only television can, to further dehumanize all of us.</TE>

<HD>Family's Coffee Cart Brewed Friendship ... and Competition</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<LD>Everybody's getting squeezed these days. You look around for a little
stability and a little comfort zone. Good luck finding it. When you
lose a bit more of the familiar--which is the way things always seem
to go--you feel like the lemon that's just been squeezed again.</LD>
<LD>   That's as close as I can get to grasping why customers are
genuinely upset that a simple coffee-cart business has been hustled
out of a lobby in an Irvine office complex.</LD>
<LD>   In the grand scheme of things, what does it matter?</LD>
<TE>   The couple who own the operation will be financially hurt but
likely won't go broke. Sodexho, the giant food-service company that
is squeezing them, plans to replace the banished cart with its own,
thereby keeping local patrons caffeinated well into the future. Even
the vanquished cart people concede the company, which oversees the
couple's month-to-month lease, has the legal authority to terminate
it.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee is coffee, right?</TE>
<TE>   Not really. To lots of people, it matters who serves up that brew
first thing in the morning or at the midafternoon break. To people at
the Park Place office complex in Irvine, thousands of cups of coffee
have been served in the past 12 1/2 years by a one-cart operation
owned by Karen and Jim Gattis and known as MJ's Espresso. More
specifically, for the past eight years, Joel Rodriguez has been the
Gattises' main man behind the Park Place blender, coming to know what
kind of coffee that people want and what the customers' names are.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Gattises set up shop in 1989, Jim was managing a
minor-league team in Florida, and Karen was pregnant with their third
child. Jim's brother, who knew the Seattle coffee scene well,
suggested they open a latte stand in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Karen says Jim's response was: "What's latte?"</TE>
<TE>   After it was explained to him, the couple followed up and named
their baby business after their baby daughter, Maggie Jean. "Jim said
when we opened, he was going to give everything away for free for the
first two days," Karen says. "He gave away 1,000 cups each of the
first two days."</TE>
<TE>   She's recalling that story at 8:30 Tuesday morning while sitting
in the lobby where their cart used to be. Overnight, Sodexho had it
removed--apparently weary of the Gattises' refusal to do so after
being told in early July their long-running lease was being
terminated in 30 days. The company later moved that date up to July
25. The Gattises were hoping for an eleventh-hour reprieve that never
came.</TE>
<TE>   As Gattis talks, several Park Place employees offer condolences.
One of them, Tim Hoffmann, a regional manager for a home-loan company
in the complex, laments the passing of the Gattises' coffee cart.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been an extraordinary asset to the building," he says.
"This is just another example of corporate America squeezing out the
little guy and denigrating the service and friendships that have
developed."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffmann refers to Rodriguez as an "institution." Rodriguez says
Sodexho offered him a job running its new cart, but he turned it
down, fearing the company might be using him to appease longtime
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Taking note of the country's well-known coffee chains, Hoffmann
says MJ's "is something much different. This is kind of like
small-town America, and things like that are disappearing."</TE>
<TE>   Sodexho spokeswoman Leslie Aun replies, "Give us a chance. Let us
show you what we're going to have available," she says by phone from
company headquarters in Gaithersburg, Md. "We're going to offer some
really nifty things, and people are going to be excited once they get
a chance to try it."</TE>
<TE>   Under their contract, the Gattises paid a percentage of their
revenue to Sodexho, which operates a large cafeteria on the floor
below the lobby. Aun, for reasons I don't understand, refuses to
characterize the Gattis cart as competition--although the Gattises
sell coffee and so does Sodexho.</TE>
<TE>   Aun concedes that Sodexho managers in Orange County handled the
Gattis matter poorly. In the vending business, she says, it's not
unusual to get 30 days' notice, but she quickly concedes that the
Gattises deserved better treatment.</TE>
<TE>   I accept her word, but it misses the point horribly.</TE>
<TE>   It's this simple: Sodexho, which has 130,000 employees and
generates $4.9 billion in revenue in North America, operates a
full-service cafeteria one floor below the Gattis cart. The Gattises
started from scratch and have been working their small corner of the
world for 12 1/2 years. They sell a product that Sodexho could be
selling more of if the Gattis cart were to disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after closing time Monday, it did.</TE>

<HD>Former LAPD Official Training Pakistani Border Security
Force</HD>
<DH>Police: U.S. consulting post comes eight years after he was
sentenced on criminal charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Justice Department has turned over the training of a
Pakistani border security force to former LAPD Deputy Chief Daniel
Sullivan, who, as a private detective following his retirement, was
placed on probation for illegally possessing confidential law
enforcement records.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan began his consultant's post in mid-May, a Justice
Department spokeswoman said. As head of the $1.3-million Border
Security and Police Modernization Project, Sullivan directs the
training and management of the U.S. program to help Pakistan's
national police secure its borders.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, Sullivan will help Pakistani police become more
responsive to the nation's citizens, according to the Justice
Department. The appointment was made by officials in the Justice
Department's criminal division. "It is a law enforcement and
development assistance program," spokeswoman Casey Stavropoulos said.
"It is not a program in which we are administering security on behalf
of the government of Pakistan."</LD>
<TE>   Stavropoulos said she did not know Sullivan's salary for the post
or the number of people who would be under his jurisdiction in the
program, based in Islamabad.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment comes eight years after Sullivan, who served in
the Los Angeles Police Department for 25 years, became the highest
ranking former LAPD official to be sentenced on criminal charges
since the department's corruption scandals of the early 1900s.
Sullivan pleaded no contest in 1994 to five misdemeanor counts of
illegally possessing confidential law enforcement records while
working as a private detective. He was placed on a year's probation
and fined almost $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office had charged Sullivan and another
private detective with receiving the files from an LAPD officer who
resigned after he was arrested on child pornography charges. That
officer, prosecutors said, used LAPD computers to get information on
people--including witnesses in criminal cases--so it could be passed
on to Sullivan and the other private detective.</TE>
<TE>   When he was charged, Sullivan, once seen as a possible successor
to then-Chief Daryl F. Gates, expressed anger at the accusations.
Denying any wrongdoing, he criticized the LAPD and prosecutors for
"trying to determine if I got information that indicates someone is a
crook." But authorities always maintained the seriousness of the
charges. "Who knows where this information could have ended up?" one
law enforcement official said at the time. "It could have gotten a
cop or someone else killed."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department official could not say whether Sullivan's
criminal case was known at the time of his appointment, which can be
renewed after two years.</TE>

<LD>"Terms: 20 guineas per annum. No extras, no vacations."</LD>
<LD>   --Charles Dickens,</LD>
<LD>   "Nicholas Nickleby," 1839</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   August. The days grow noticeably shorter, if hardly less wacky.
The plasmic fires of the sun still have the final say, though,
overheating our noggins, wringing the juices right out of us,
igniting yearnings for seashores, shaded forests, open roads or even,
say, the quiet, hard-baked brushlands of Texas. August and vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds good, but in fact vacation has always been a shaky
proposition in this country. Now it looks like the whole dreamy
notion that a portion of the year belongs to us alone has finally
come unraveled. Our foremost defender of vacation has surrendered.
He's yielded to the Calvinist ankle-biters in Washington.
Regrettably, he's lost his gumption to relax. And we'll all pay the
price.</TE>
<TE>   George Bush is off for a "working vacation." And his hirelings at
the White House want us to underline the working part. Grab your fly
rod and charge up your cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Bush, meet Mr. Dickens.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Smithsonian Institution, a philosopher named
Hildemar of Corbie offered a definition of vacation back in the year
845: "Vacare means to relinquish one thing and to replace it with
some other ... manual work being set aside."</TE>
<TE>   A working vacation is like a working night's sleep. An incongruous
idea on its face. And for what end, exactly?</TE>
<TE>   OK, there's plenty happening in the world these days to make us
nervous. But there's also such a thing as gaining perspective. Time
to think. Time to clear one's head by not thinking. For presidents
too.</TE>
<TE>   Whose idea was this, anyway, to turn Bush's vacation into another
controversy?</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologists tell us that Indians near Cape Flattery in
Washington state are owed credit for being first in North America to
take off the month of August. No fishing, no berry-picking. Not until
the 1760s, though, when people began to gather in the cities and
amass wealth, did the modern idea of the American vacation catch on.
Naturally, most people were too guilt-ridden to admit right away that
they were loafing. Instead, they went off to the country for their
"health," which ironically turns out to be the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Methodists devised a religious justification for play
on the shores of Lake Chautauqua in New York--summer gatherings that
allowed families to swim, picnic, sunbathe and learn about art and
music in the service of the Lord.</TE>
<TE>   The advent of railroads, automobiles, the rise of the middle class
and unionism all contributed to the popular spread of vacations. Bit
by bit, Americans found themselves challenging the wisdom of that
pinch-penny old taskmaster Ben Franklin, who insisted that "leisure
is time for doing something useful."</TE>
<TE>   What did he know about it anyway?</TE>
<TE>   For a short while, leisure time was a sign of progress. What was
the point of all these labor-saving devices, anyway, if not to save
us from so much labor?</TE>
<TE>   True, Americans never quite embraced vacation with the gusto of
the rest of the industrialized world. Our average vacation of 13 days
per year, whether you take it in a gulp or sip it here and there as I
do, leaves us the laughingstock of all of Europe and plenty of other
places. The Italians, for instance, average 42 days' vacation a year,
but they haven't had to build a nation out of wilderness lately
either.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, progress made a U-turn here about a generation ago. I
don't recall that we were asked our opinion. But suddenly, huff huff,
we had to outwork the world--more and faster, no matter what the
price.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not being light when I say one of the best ideas that Bush
offered the country was his challenge to this single-mindedness in
our purpose. He has spoken repeatedly of the need for balance in
life. Part of him was born to goof off, and it isn't the worst part
either. He made the point many other ways, whether promoting
volunteerism or championing the family.</TE>
<TE>   He got right up to the point when you have to lead by example.
Then he backed away. You can blame the critics or you can blame the
president for heeding them. Either way, the message comes down to
this: It's August, grab that laptop, get your tool bag. There's work
to be done.</TE>

<HD>Expand the City Council to Expand City Services</HD>
<DH>Secession is no solution. Better representation is a first
step for L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERWIN CHEMERINSKY</AU>
<BD>Erwin Chemerinsky is a constitutional law professor at
USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most significant complaint of those advocating secession from Los
Angeles is that city government is not sufficiently responsive. The
City Charter adopted in June 1999 created neighborhood councils and
area planning commissions to address this concern. Although important
changes, they are not enough. The widespread perception that City
Hall doesn't adequately meet residents' needs persists.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of secession must explain why breaking the city apart
would make city services worse for those in a new San Fernando Valley
or Hollywood city and the remaining Los Angeles, but they also must
offer specific plans for addressing the secessionists' concerns.</LD>
<LD>   A particularly important reform to reconsider is expanding the
size of the Los Angeles City Council. Los Angeles has 15 council
districts, compared with 51 in New York and 50 in Chicago. Each
member of the Los Angeles City Council represents about 250,000
constituents, more than any other city council representative in the
nation.</LD>
<TE>   Increasing the size of the City Council, and thus decreasing the
size of each district, would go a long way toward creating a more
responsive city government. Most people turn to their City Council
member when they have a problem with the city's bureaucracy or need
something from city government. A council member could perform these
tasks much more effectively for a smaller number of people.</TE>
<TE>   The two charter reform commissions agreed that an increase in the
size of the council was essential, but they could not agree on the
appropriate number of council members to recommend. In June 1999,
there were two initiatives on the ballot to increase council
size--one for 21 districts, the other for 25 districts. Voters
rejected both.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly, confusion from having two proposals on the same
ballot contributed to the rejection of the initiatives. But it also
was clear that voters did not want to increase the number of
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Yet secession and boroughs, proposals that many support, both
would create far more new politicians than would increasing the size
of the City Council. Expanding the council is undoubtedly the least
expensive and most efficient way to create a more responsive city
government. The City Council should immediately begin work to place a
proposal on the ballot for the spring 2003 election to amend the City
Charter to create a larger City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Serious efforts are needed to revise local government structure in
California. But other needed reforms are more ambitious and outside
the reach of the city. Services are split among city, county and
special service districts (like the Los Angeles Unified School
District) in a manner that confuses the voters and undermines
accountability. For example, the city government has virtually no
involvement with the governing of the schools, which is quite
different from cities such as New York and Chicago. The
responsibilities assigned to each level of government are a result of
historical accidents and choices made long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reconsideration of local governance by the California Legislature
is long overdue. Most important is reconsideration of Proposition 13,
which limits property tax rates.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that most of the complaints of inadequate services
are not the result of inadequate representation; they are the product
of insufficient money. Changing Proposition 13 would be politically
difficult, but it is imperative if the concerns about inadequate
services, especially in poor areas, are to be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   Secession is the wrong answer to what ails Los Angeles, but
secessionists have raised some valid concerns that need to be
addressed. Increasing the size of the City Council would be a good
first step.</TE>

<HD>As Kashmir Boils, Keep Heat on Pakistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SELIG S. HARRISON</AU>
<BD>Selig S. Harrison is director of the Asia program at
the Center for International Policy and a senior scholar of the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until last week, the American diplomatic effort to head off a war
between India and Pakistan had focused sharply on stopping
Pakistani-sponsored Islamic extremist incursions into
Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir. Now, after his visit to India and
Pakistan, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has relaxed his pressure
on Islamabad, ignoring continued Pakistani sponsorship of these
incursions and efforts to disrupt the key October elections in the
Indian-ruled part of Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   This abrupt tilt toward Islamabad has provoked Indian distrust of
U.S. bona fides that will make it difficult for Washington to
continue acting as a de facto mediator between the two nuclear-armed
South Asian rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Powell declared that India should permit an "international
presence" to observe the October balloting, "to show the world that
it is a free, open, fair election."</LD>
<TE>   This was good advice, but Powell failed to couple it with an
appeal to Pakistani intelligence agencies to stop their systematic
assassinations of Kashmiri insurgents who advocate participation in
the elections, like the respected moderate Abdul Ghani Lone, who was
murdered May 21.</TE>
<TE>   Seven leaders of the National Conference party that governs in the
Indian portion of Kashmir have also been killed during the last
month.</TE>
<TE>   The new American tilt toward Islamabad was also reflected in the
fact that Powell pointedly avoided calling on Pakistan to dismantle
the training camps and communications facilities on its side of the
Kashmir cease-fire line. So long as this infrastructure remains in
place, Pakistan can adjust the level of infiltration at will,
preventing the return to normalcy that is necessary for meaningful
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence increasingly points to   Pakistani fingerprints in Lone's
murder. Lone had signaled his intention to run in the Kashmir state
assembly election. The director of Pakistan's Inter-Services
Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Ehsan Ul-Haq, presided over a strategy
meeting held in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, in April with seven
key Kashmiri insurgent leaders who had received Pakistani aid,
including Lone.</TE>
<TE>   Ehsan denounced Lone for supporting participation in the elections
and warned him to stop, according to accounts in Sharjah
Arabic-language newspapers and the Pakistani press that were
confirmed to me by a Pakistani diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Lone went to the United States for medical
treatment, returning to Kashmir on May 19. On May 20, at a meeting of
Pakistani-backed insurgent groups, he urged participation in the
elections. The next day, he was assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the U.S. is able to restrain Pakistan, the next targets
could well be Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, the principal Muslim religious
leader in the Indian-controlled Kashmir Valley, who supported Lone in
the Sharjah meeting; and Shabir Shah, another widely respected
moderate, who met with a top Indian official recently to explore a
compromise with India concerning the election and autonomy for
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The United States should urge Pakistan to support the elections as
the first step toward a dialogue between India and Pakistan on
Kashmir. Before beneficial discussions can take place, New Delhi will
have to negotiate on autonomy with a new, more representative
government in the Indian-ruled portion.</TE>
<TE>   If India and the Kashmiris under its control could reach an
accommodation on autonomy, the stage would be set for a dialogue
between Islamabad and the Kashmiris in Pakistani-controlled Azad
(Free) Kashmir for a comparable degree of autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan could then discuss recognition of the
cease-fire line as a permanent international boundary; interchange
between the two parts of Kashmir; a pullback of the forces of both
sides; and a reduction of the Indian and Pakistani forces stationed
in both parts of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Little attention is paid to the fact that the Kashmiris under
Pakistani control are also seeking autonomy. On July 26, the Pakistan
Daily Times reported that Altaf Qadiri, a key leader of the All Party
Hurriyat Conference, a Pakistani-sponsored insurgent coalition,
called the Azad Kashmir regime "worse than the government on the
Indian side."</TE>
<TE>   The October elections mark a critical turning point in the search
for peace in Kashmir, and only an evenhanded U.S. policy can help
promote broad-based participation by the Kashmiri people. New Delhi
should be urged to make the elections fair and to permit some form of
international monitoring. But India's best efforts will not bring
stability to the state unless the U.S. can get Pakistan to keep its
hands off.</TE>

<HD>'Play Ball!': Words to Remember Manzanar</HD>
<DH>Diamond should be restored at internment camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE KLUGER</AU>
<BD>Steve Kluger is the author of the baseball play
"Bullpen" and the novel "Last Days of Summer" (Avon/HarperCollins,
1998).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baking in the California desert 220 miles northeast of Los Angeles
and at the foot of Mt. Whitney sits what used to be a ballpark--one
that wouldn't even qualify for the minor leagues today but whose very
presence is just as elemental to U.S. history as Ebbets Field.</LD>
<LD>   The dirt diamond--its baselines still visible beneath 57 years'
worth of sagebrush--rests squarely along Highway 395 on the eastern
border of what was once euphemistically called the Manzanar War
Relocation Center.</LD>
<LD>   By now, the history of Manzanar is well out of the shadows. In
early 1942, Gen. John L. DeWitt and California Atty. Gen. Earl
Warren--casting about for a reason to get rid of all Japanese
Americans living on the West Coast--invented a kind of Silly Putty
logic that promptly put the Bill of Rights on the endangered list.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that there have been no instances of espionage to date
indicates how devious these people really are," warned DeWitt, "and
points to an almost certain plot in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The upshot was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order
9066, which resulted in the roundup of 120,313 aliens and "nonaliens"
(i.e., citizens) and their deportation to federal concentration
camps--generally with the loss of their homes, their property and
anything else they couldn't carry with them.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton's $5-million appropriations bill allowed the
Department of the Interior to honor the Americans whose Constitution
was taken away from them during those three terrible years. But while
the National Park Service is in the process of restoring the Manzanar
site--complete with a visitors center, a block of barracks and
regularly scheduled tours beginning in September 2003--the only plans
for the baseball field consist of a free-standing marker somewhere
around where home plate used to be.</TE>
<TE>   This, as they say in Cooperstown, is an error of major league
proportions--because a memorial to Manzanar without its baseball
diamond is like the Pledge of Allegiance without the flag.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of baseball to those incarcerated behind Manzanar's
barbed wire can't be overstated: It was perhaps one of the few
aspects of the lives they'd led prior to E.O. 9066 that they were
allowed to keep with them after everything else had been taken away.
In fact, although Manzanar wasn't fully populated until June 1942,
the camp's newspaper from early May shows that there were already
eight baseball teams in fierce competition. The diamond was one of
the first things to go up, even before the school had been
constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball was the bond that kept many of these families together
during some pretty rough moments. It got them through the
disappointing Supreme Court decisions upholding the constitutionality
of the internment, and--as Americans--it got them through the rage
and humiliation engendered by the loyalty questionnaire.</TE>
<TE>   But would anybody break away from an otherwise somber pilgrimage
to an internment camp for a photo op along a dusty first base line?
Or a pickup game? Or even catch between father and son? One need look
no further for an answer than Dyersville, Iowa--where people from all
over the country still make Field of Dreams an out-of-the-way pit
stop on their itineraries just to be able to play ball on the fabled
diamond-in-a-cornfield.</TE>
<TE>   To have the same sort of magic strike at Manzanar--this time
between the generations and, even more significantly, between the
cultures--would go a long way toward underscoring the message the
park is meant to convey. Indeed, the inclusion of a diamond might
achieve what reparations alone couldn't: healing. Something like
closure is best accomplished when a 12-year-old Caucasian kid tosses
a ball to a 10-year-old Latino kid, who then throws it to an
11-year-old Asian. Especially when they don't even know one other.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't ask for a more human legacy than that.</TE>

<HD>A Misreading of the Market</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By objecting to a Latino supermarket's plans to open a new outlet,
Anaheim planners disclose an ethnic bias that shows, at best,
lamentable ignorance about Southern California's economic landscape.</LD>
<LD>   City officials are throwing blockades in the path of Gigante USA,
saying that it's the wrong kind of store for the Anaheim Plaza
shopping center. They envision the mall as a regional draw that would
pull in customers from throughout the city and beyond. The
redevelopment director expresses concern in a letter that
Mexico-based Gigante "does not cater to the public at large" and
surprise that the Latino-themed market's "signage and music were
predominantly in Spanish."</LD>
<LD>   Presumably, the idea is that non-Latinos would feel alien in a
store where the language and tunes are unfamiliar and where much of
the food is from another ethnic heritage. Sort of the way Latino and
Asian immigrants might feel as they eye the mac and cheese and listen
to the golden oldies at Pavilions?</LD>
<TE>   This Gigante store, the first of its kind in Orange County, would
open in a city whose largest demographic group is Latino, 47% of the
population. How much more "public at large" could you get? It would
do business in a county where Latinos make up more than 30% of the
population and have emerged as a potent consumer force.</TE>
<TE>   That hardly amounts to a strictly neighborhood draw.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger chains--Ralphs, Vons, Albertson's--recognize this new
economic reality with their rapidly expanding sections that cater to
Latino and Asian tastes. In certain stores, Mexican- and Central
American-style food offerings are as prominent as Hamburger Helper
and hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   And still, Anaheim officials don't seem to realize that in a
population as diverse as this area's, the word "ethnic" no longer
equates with a narrow interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California food industry serves a sophisticated
palate always in search of the new or the best. Home cooks will drive
several towns away just to find an honest garam masala at an Indian
grocery. The pan-Asian 99 Ranch markets draw a diverse crowd for the
live fish and frozen lumpia.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante markets--where the signs are in both Spanish and
English--sell a dozen varieties of chiles and freshly made tortillas,
yet Anaheim officials can't seem to see that this store might be as
big a regional draw as the Mervyn's department store that was
welcomed to the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim, wake up and smell the bolillos.</TE>

<HD>Taxing Proposal for E-Filers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly two dozen states have created consumer-friendly electronic
systems that make it easier to file income tax forms. But California
is tumbling in the opposite direction with a bill that would force
online filers to use private tax-preparation software companies. This
is a classic lobbyist-driven bill that offers no benefits for
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how e-filing works in Maine, Indiana and other
forward-thinking states. Taxpayers access forms on state Web sites
and enter income and other data. Online tax tables and a built-in
calculator accelerate the process.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer ease isn't the only reason e-filing is gaining ground
nationally. Electronic systems also reduce errors, cut the cost of
processing paper returns and often speed up refunds.</LD>
<TE>   But AB 2781, which has already passed the Assembly and today goes
before the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, would not allow
Californians the choice of filing directly online to the state.
E-filing taxpayers who chose not to use TurboTax or a similar
state-approved private software program would have to download and
print state tax forms, use their own calculators, pull figures from
hard copies of tax tables and then go back online to finish filing.</TE>
<TE>   Intuit, parent of TurboTax, has spent $400,000 since 1999 lobbying
lawmakers and Franchise Tax Board members. Development of a state
system also is opposed by state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who
maintains that the state could monitor the keystrokes of taxpayers
who filed online and target for auditing those who made a lot of
revisions. The Federation of Tax Administrators, a group that
monitors state tax filing and payment systems, finds the claim
unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   Tax officials in states with e-filing systems note that consumers
already buy airplane tickets and pay bills online and say that
taxpayers, if they're worried, can stick with old-fashioned paper
returns.</TE>
<TE>   The system proposed under AB 2781 would certainly require
taxpayers to expose a lot of valuable confidential financial data to
private companies.</TE>
<TE>   Burgeoning state tax preparation sites increase pressure on the
federal government to offer something similar, and Intuit sees the
threat. Software companies are promising to provide free tax filing
for households with incomes of $25,000 or less, but those earning
more would have to pay $5 to $13 to file state returns
electronically, on top of federal filing fees and possible software
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, AB 2781 would turn the state into a potent marketing
arm for its selected tax-preparation "partners."</TE>
<TE>   No one likes to pay taxes. Sacramento shouldn't be making it
harder.</TE>

<HD>Uruguay Loan Makes Sense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's grant of up to $1.5 billion in short-term
bridge financing to Uruguay's central bank was both bold and
unexpected. The same folks at the Treasury Department who had so
vehemently argued in other cases that such assistance was a waste of
taxpayer money should be commended for putting together a financial
package this week that will help banks in Uruguay sort out their
crisis without wasting taxpayer funds.</LD>
<LD>   The bridge loan is to be repaid in a matter of days, perhaps
starting today, as Uruguay starts receiving the first installments of
$3.8 billion in long-term loans from the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Why rescue Uruguay and not gravely ill Argentina or financially
and politically unstable Brazil?</LD>
<TE>   Well, there is a logic to it. Sandwiched between the two largest
countries of the region, tiny Uruguay with its 3.4 million
inhabitants has long been one of Latin America's most stable and
orthodox economies. The solid credit ratings granted by agencies like
Standard &amp; Poor's have made it attractive to foreign capital.</TE>
<TE>   The problems Uruguay is facing are mostly due to external
pressures. Without the brief loan, Uruguayan banks could run out of
money as cash-strapped Argentines, their own bank withdrawals
severely limited, cross the Rio de la Plata to withdraw their money
from banks in Montevideo, Uruguay. Instability in the Brazilian
financial markets and the devaluation of the Brazilian real have also
taken a toll on Uruguayan banks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. financing package came after Uruguay's Congress approved
legislation to strengthen banking regulations, which means some weak
banks have already gone under.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, when banks in Uruguay opened after a four-day hiatus,
there were no signs of panic. Yet the smooth reactivation of banking
operations does not mean the path ahead for Uruguay will be easy.
Solving the current banking crisis won't restart economic growth in
the country or the region.</TE>
<TE>   What may help the region in the long term is the trade promotion
bill, signed by President Bush on Tuesday, that will make it easier
to negotiate free-trade agreements. A long-discussed free-trade pact
with Chile may actually happen, bringing renewed hopes for expanding
the North American Free Trade Agreement to South America.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has delivered its share of gaffes in Latin
America, including a zinger this week by Treasury Secretary Paul H.
O'Neill about government corruption. But the White House deserves
praise for turning its focus to the region, starting with a limited
loan that is safe for taxpayers.</TE>

<HD>MTA Commutes Can Drive You Crazy</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I ride the Red Line and many bus lines daily and never witnessed any
polling, nor do I know anyone who participated in this so-called
survey ("MTA Survey Finds Most Riders Happy," July 30). The results
are similar to those of President Bush: 60% to 70% approval ratings,
which leads me to understand that I must know only the other 30% of
our population.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from the park-and-ride Metro riders who live and work
conveniently near the Red Line stations, I know of no one who's the
least bit satisfied with our transit service.</LD>
<LD>   Those of us who've lived in cities like Chicago and New York and
are used to buses every 15 minutes are frustrated with commutes that
take four to five hours of our days. Many of us freelance; I travel
to different areas of Los Angeles daily, and that is where the tidy
park and ride ends and the nightmare begins.</LD>
<TE>   On a Wilshire Boulevard Rapid bus recently we stopped for 10
minutes to de-board a handicapped person in a wheelchair. As the door
finally closed, a man ran up and knocked on the door, only to be
ignored, which happens to me daily. A group of us ascended to street
level at the Universal City station to see our 152 bus across the
street. Our whistles and screams couldn't get the driver's attention
(he was on his cell phone) and he pulled off, stranding all of us
headed to Burbank for another hour. I've e-mailed the MTA about this,
obviously to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   There is no coordination between the Metro and the bus lines--it's
hit or miss. And the machines won't take your dollars unless they're
freshly printed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mexican Supermarket Meets Obstacles in Anaheim," Aug. 5: The
treatment of the Gigante USA President Justo Frias by Anaheim city
officials is racist. Reading the statements of these officials is
painful. If these officials read their own statements they must be
aware of how hollow they sound.</LD>
<LD>   I have been in a Gigante store in Mexicali. The store was clean,
well lighted and full of shoppers. Why would any city want to keep
Gigante out? Come on, Anaheim, do the right thing and let the cash

<LD>Re "The Lakers' Legendary Voice," Aug. 6: Chick Hearn was simply the
best--as a person, as a sportscaster. He was one of us--the ordinary
people who love sports. Whatever sports you enjoy, you could not help
but admire and relate to this Laker broadcasting icon. Today, many
people shed tears for this "one gentle of a man." The whole of Los
Angeles will miss him. In fact, the whole of sports will miss him.</LD>

<TE>   Chick Hearn has been a constant in my life. As far back as I can
remember, "Golden Throat" called the games for my beloved Lakers. His
honesty and quick wit made him a marvel on the microphone. He could
have me in stitches or infuriated about the way the Lakers were
playing.</TE>
<TE>   One childhood incident of mine describes Chick perfectly. A couple
of buddies and I sneaked into the Sports Arena to catch the 1988-89
Lakers practicing before the game.</TE>
<TE>   To our disappointment, there were no Lakers on the court, but
Chick was on the floor setting up for the game. We rushed down to
meet him and ask for an autograph. He politely acknowledged us and
started signing his name. We noticed that he was wearing a
championship ring. In awe, we asked which year it was from. He
promptly took off the ring and handed it to us so we could examine it
more closely. We were shocked and excited; we had a real NBA
championship ring on our fingers. He truly loved and respected the
fans. This simple gesture made me a lifelong admirer and in a small
way made me feel like a part of the Lakers. People like Chick don't
come around too often.</TE>

<HD>A New Tom Paine Would Take Us Back to Our Roots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We Need a Modern Thomas Paine" (Opinion, Aug. 4), by J. William
Gibson, was right on, but didn't go far enough. There is the question
of whether the necessarily radical extension of his material could be
published in the mainstream media. We are oscillating to and fro
(e.g., Democrats versus Republicans) within a narrow and outdated
conceptual framework.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is now societally an old, exhausted and derelict nation,
delusionally driven by a search for external and internal villains
and detached from reality by layers of government, industrial and
media obfuscation. Most dangerous is the disconnect between our
social thinking and our advanced technology. Is it not now time for a
new American (this time nonviolent) Revolution?</LD>
<LD>   Kenyon B. De Greene</LD>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I concur with Gibson's call for a modern Thomas Paine to lead an
organized opposition movement in protest of our current political,
economic and social predicaments. It would be a cruel irony, however,
if this modern-day rebel followed Gibson's advice by advocating
increased campaign finance restrictions and heightened government
involvement in the economy.</TE>
<TE>   After all, production and distribution of Paine's influential
pamphlet, "Common Sense," would likely be diminished 60 days before
an election under McCain-Feingold [campaign finance law], and Paine
would likely point out that our 10,000-page tax code and heightened
government regulation of the economy have been the best protectors of
corporate elites.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Buccola</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gibson's opinion is good; however, I was disappointed that he did
not elaborate more on who Thomas Paine was and his contribution to
the success of our Revolutionary War. I doubt if many people today
know. His sacrifice and devotion to boosting the spirits of a ragtag
army of the common people who wanted freedom has pretty well been
ignored. Paine quit his job and, as an unpaid civilian, went from
camp to camp, battle site to battle site, to encourage George
Washington's army to hang on and not be discouraged. It was only
after the war that the Congress recognized his contribution and
rewarded him with a meager pension.</TE>
<TE>   Many people didn't like what he preached and ridiculed him.
Children would follow him, throw rocks at him and shout, "Paine,
Paine, damn be his name!" He was a true revolutionary, but after all,
we were fighting a war for independence. I recommend people read his
books "Common Sense" and "The Rights of Man."</TE>

<HD>No Tax Dollars for Holden's Defense</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "City Council Votes to Pay Holden's Legal Fee," Aug. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Again! We have to pay Los Angeles City Council member Nate
Holden's legal fees for his defense. Our arrogant City Council
members, without a voice from the public, have agreed to spend
$75,000 to hire a defense attorney for Holden, at $325 an hour. This
is only for the start-up costs; this amount will go much higher
before this is settled.</LD>
<LD>   I believe that this is at least the third time our tax dollars are
going to defend this councilman. Enough is enough. My tax dollars are
for use by the city, not for the defense of Holden.</LD>
<TE>   We have wasted more than $200,000 on this councilman's defense
prior to this action. This is money the city needs. If Holden cannot
run himself or his office properly then he should pay for the defense
when there are allegations of indiscretions.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert Smith</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office's assertion that it cannot represent
Holden in a dispute between two city employees is absurd. The city is
being sued by a former employee whom Holden fired. The city attorney
represents the city, not Holden. Following this logic, if the City
Council is paying an outside lawyer to defend Holden, shouldn't it
also be paying the plaintiff's legal fees?</TE>
<TE>   The attorney hired is Holden's personal attorney, Mark Geragos.
That is the true conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Bennett</TE>

minds: Nate Holden.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "As History Repeats Itself, the Scholar Becomes the Story," Aug.
4: Scholarship is not whatever one can get away with.</LD>
<LD>   When I taught English composition at the University of Dayton for
38 years, I did not allow the students to paraphrase. I told them
that if the idea was worth using they should use the exact words of
the original writer to get the original feeling and exact meaning.
And they must cite it. They had no problem understanding that.</LD>
<LD>   Doris Kearns Goodwin would fail freshman comp. She is a scholar
who doesn't honor the simple fundamentals of freshman education.
There is a place in Dante's hell ... or is it Goodwin's inferno?</LD>
<TE>   Tony Macklin</TE>

<TE>   How mean-spirited your article on Goodwin is. She has admitted her
errors, has compensated those whom she wronged, apologized and tried
to get on with her Lincoln biography. I have followed her career,
have read every one of her books and find her an admirable and honest

<TE>   My point is this: In our present mean-spirited world, everything
is written in the negative--this article could have been written with
the same facts but in a more positive light. That quote from Sally
Quinn borders on the comic.</TE>
<TE>   I implore you and the rest of the media to emphasize the positive
in such articles; let's try to be less accusatory--this era must
pass.</TE>

<LD>"Opening a Citadel of Prayer" (Aug. 3), about the Indianapolis
Carmelite sisters, reaffirmed my belief that cloister orders are a
luxury we can no longer indulge. As a wavering Catholic, I found
their timid resolve to cross the divide between their contemplative
lives in the monastery and our world teeming with needs worthy of a
loudly pronounced, "You go, girls!"</LD>
<LD>   In a place where we need every prayer, every kindness, every
light, the sisters are now with us. And in the most technologically
savvy way too. Welcome back, and may they share themselves here,
now--and work along with us.</LD>

<TE>   Perhaps if the Carmelite nuns still wore their traditional black
habits and practiced the faith of their founder instead of mocking
the discipline of contemplative life they would have novices and
postulants looking to join their order. Instead, these women in
"sundresses from Goodwill," talking to no one at the local strip
mall, simply look weird.</TE>
<TE>   Is it a coincidence that there are fewer than half the number of
nuns since Vatican II "relaxed" the church's standards on religious
life?</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>RANCHITA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>An aggressive wildfire burning in the mountains northeast of San
Diego took fire crews by surprise Tuesday, jumping a containment line
near here and threatening to become one of the state's largest blazes
in a dangerous fire season.</LD>
<LD>   Several forces have combined to make the so-called Pines Fire a
particularly fierce and unpredictable blaze--extremely low humidity,
temperatures near 90 degrees, a fuel supply untouched by wildfire for
more than three decades and an abundance of trees killed long ago by
a bark beetle infestation.</LD>
<LD>   Fire crews are counting on the fire to head southeast through Anza
Borrego State Park and over the North Pinon Mountains to the desert
near Borrego Springs, at which time the fire should extinguish itself
for lack of vegetation.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters had expected to have the fire under control early
this week, but the difficult conditions have pushed back that
prediction to Sunday. The fire was 48% contained Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In nine days, the fire has burned 47,780 acres and taken along
with it 19 homes, 25 storage sheds and barns, and 50 cars, trucks and
tractors. Fire officials estimate 500 homes have escaped the flames.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has gobbled up mostly dry manzanita, along with oak trees
and the occasional ponderosa and pinon pine. With the aid of fickle
gusts of wind Tuesday, embers skipped as far as a mile ahead of the
fire, starting new hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   "It basically does about anything it wants," said Bill Peters, a
spokesman for the California Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   With the fire's capricious behavior, authorities attempted to keep
500 residents who live in several tiny mountain communities--Warner
Springs, Ranchita and the Los Coyotes Indian Reservation--away from
their homes.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone heeded the warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials were getting ready to escort Roberta Haubold up to
her parents' home in this tiny town about 80 miles northeast of San
Diego on Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Her 84-year-old father has refused to leave and her 81-year-old
mother can't drive herself out, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad is a jerk. He won't come out," Haubold said as she backed
out of a makeshift parking lot where residents get updates from fire
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents have lived in the 600-square-foot wooden house since
1979. "I would just feel better if I were there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   National Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley conceded that some
residents just won't leave, adding, "Mandatory [evacuation] does not
really mean mandatory. You can't force the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Helicopters buzzed overhead through plumes of thick, dark smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Crews stationed a firetruck and at least four firefighters at each
home in the area, said Nick Schuler, an engineer with the California
Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy appeared to be working--along California 22, the
lone green spots were adjacent homes saved from the flames.</TE>

<HD>Audit Assails Caltrans for California 33 Project</HD>
<DH>Highways: Flawed design and contractor problems resulted in
a yearlong delay that cost $321,000 and inconvenienced motorists, the
state report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bungling by Caltrans led to a yearlong delay and a $321,000 overrun
on a California 33 improvement project, state auditors disclosed
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The state agency came up with a flawed design and was slipshod in
monitoring its general contractor, a report from the state auditor
concluded. Caltrans also fell down on public relations and failed to
note that its contractor's insurance company was nearly broke, the
auditors said.</LD>
<LD>   The audit was done at the request of Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth
Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), who fielded numerous complaints from
motorists inconvenienced by the on-again, off-again project.</LD>
<TE>   The report "shines a light on areas where Caltrans needs to make
improvements to prevent problems such as those experienced in Ventura
County's Highway 33 project," Jackson said Tuesday. "Now we must work
to ensure that Caltrans makes the necessary changes."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of a three-mile concrete median on California 33
between west Main Street in Ventura and Crooked Palm Road started
early in 2000. It was not completed until last Dec. 12. At times,
lanes were closed and the roadway was narrowed by temporary
barricades.</TE>
<TE>   Sampling Caltrans practices around the state, the audit examined
19 other projects. Most came in under budget and experienced delays
that were "reasonable," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion pleased Maria Contreras-Sweet, secretary of the
state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency. She acknowledged
"isolated problems" on California 33 and vowed to correct most of the
management shortcomings found at other projects as well.</TE>
<TE>   The audit criticized Caltrans engineers for poor record-keeping.
At five of the 20 projects, engineers did not keep required daily
records. At 14, engineers did not note those days when work could
have been done but wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Such records are essential in resolving business disputes, the
auditors said.</TE>
<TE>   The California 33 project was badly executed from the outset.
Pressed for time, Caltrans staff members gave the contractor design
plans that did not take into account a previous coating of asphalt
that raised some portions of the road, the audit said.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, the original contractor used a concrete mix so wet
that portions of its barrier crumbled and had to be rebuilt by
another contractor, the audit said.</TE>
<TE>   After 22 months marked by equipment problems, financial
difficulties and delay, Caltrans fired its first contractor, Tapuz
Enterprises of Reseda. However, the state may have difficulty
collecting on the firm's performance bond because its insurance
company is insolvent, the audit said.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors recommended that Caltrans check the financial stability
of insurers. However, agency officials responded that the job would
be better performed by state insurance officials.</TE>

<HD>Senate Tables Billboard Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TED ROHRLICH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Senate on Tuesday postponed indefinitely consideration of a
bill that would encourage more billboards along California freeways.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which has already passed the Assembly, is backed by
billboard interests and associations of local governments, including
the California League of Cities.</LD>
<LD>   Its key provision would give cash-starved cities and school boards
an incentive to go into partnerships with billboard companies.</LD>
<TE>   State law generally prohibits billboards along the 80% of
California freeways with landscaped greenery along their borders.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would allow signs to be placed on properties adjacent to
landscaped freeways, including city streets, that are owned by local
governments.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was the brainchild of lobbyist Ken Spiker Jr., who has
represented a billboard company, Regency Outdoor Advertising, in
stalled efforts to make a similar deal with the city of Lynwood for
signs along the Century Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Carried by Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach), the bill
was pulled from a Senate Transportation Committee hearing calendar
after opposition from the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans released a letter opposing the bill and registering an
objection from the Federal Highway Administration. Both agencies said
the bill would violate federal highway beautification law and
jeopardize $210 million of the $2.1 billion that the state gets in
federal highway funding each year.</TE>
<TE>   Oropeza's office said that, in light of the opposition, she met
with Transportation Committee Chairman Kevin Murray and they decided
to postpone its consideration. Oropeza's office said Murray promised
to schedule a fact-finding hearing on the measure in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising in city redevelopment zones is tightly regulated, and
signs are permitted only for businesses developed in the zones. Under
the Oropeza bill, billboards would be allowed to carry advertisements
for any product sold in any store in the zones.</TE>

<HD>'Ernie' Chapman, 91; O.C. Pioneers' Scion Left Own Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvin C. "Ernie" Chapman, a link between Orange County's rich
agricultural past and its modern face, died late Monday at age 91.</LD>
<LD>   Son of the man who created the booming Valencia orange industry in
Orange County, Chapman helped usher in the urbanization of the county
after the Depression and World War II when he sold off the family's
Fullerton orchards for housing and commercial developments.</LD>
<LD>   He was also the longest-serving university board member in the
nation, having been a trustee at Chapman University, named for his
father, from 1934 until his death.</LD>
<TE>   Family members, friends and colleagues remembered him Tuesday as
quiet, principled and astute in business.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider Ernie Chapman the embodiment of ... the culture of
this university," Chapman University President James L. Doti said.
"He spoke more eloquently and did more than anyone else to preserve
the spiritual connection and our value-centeredness--that Chapman was
not just a place to go to get credits and learn skills, but a place
to develop one's character."</TE>
<TE>   When Richard Nixon spoke at the university after his resignation,
Doti was surprised to learn that Chapman and the former president
were old friends. It turned out Chapman had beaten Nixon in a college
debate competition decades before, when he was a student at
California Christian College, later renamed Chapman University after
his father rescued it from near bankruptcy, and Nixon was at Whittier
College.</TE>
<TE>   "He beat Nixon before JFK did," Doti said.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, keenly aware of being a member of one of the region's
most prominent families, made his own mark. Besides running the
family business and serving on the university board, he was mayor of
Fullerton from 1948 to 1950, was the first chairman of the city's
Planning Commission in 1938, and sat on the Orange County Fair and
Exposition Center board longer than anyone.</TE>
<TE>   He was the kind of man who never missed a Kiwanis Club meeting in
62 years, the county's oldest Eagle Scout and a lifelong member of
the First Christian Church in Fullerton, of the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), his wife said.</TE>
<TE>   A tall, athletic man, Chapman was an avid football player while in
college. He was overjoyed in 1994 when Chapman reinstituted varsity
football after a 62-year hiatus, playing in a stadium named for him.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman met his second wife, Edy, more than three decades ago at
the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach, when he saw her playing tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it was love at first sight for him," she said Tuesday.
He courted her for six years, and they were married 26. "It was the
happiest 26 years of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman, who had suffered from cancer and pneumonia, is survived
by his wife, daughters Cherie Harrison and Claire Nichols from his
first marriage, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were pending. He will be buried with his
parents at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 11-year-old son of a Simi Valley woman accused of conspiring to
burn and beat her husband to death testified Tuesday that his father
was mean and abusive.</LD>
<LD>   The boy and his 9-year-old brother were called to the witness
stand by the prosecution to describe events surrounding a March 25
fire allegedly set by their mother and half-sister.</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Childs, 37, and Jennifer Childs, 19, are accused of trying
to kill Larry Childs, 57, by setting fire to his mattress and beating
him with baseball bats as he ran from the flames.</LD>
<TE>   Each is charged with attempted murder, arson and the use of deadly
weapons. Eileen Childs also faces child endangerment charges because
her sons were in the home at the time of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the mother and daughter conspired to kill
Larry Childs to collect on $1.4 million in life insurance. But
defense lawyers say the two acted in self-defense when the abusive
father flew into a rage after a candle accidentally sparked a fire in
his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the boys testified that they awoke during the night to
hear their father screaming: "The house is on fire! Help me! I'm on
fire!"</TE>
<TE>   Arms flailing, Larry Childs ran around the house while Jennifer
Childs led the brothers outside, the older boy testified.</TE>
<TE>   The younger brother told jurors his sister went back inside. He
said he later saw her blocking his father at the front door, yelling:
"Don't go near the boys!"</TE>
<TE>   During previous testimony, Larry Childs told jurors that his wife
and stepdaughter attacked him with bats. He denied being an abusive
father and husband, and rejected a suggestion that his wife sometimes
put herself between him and the children to protect them from abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But his 11-year-old son told jurors that Eileen Childs had stepped
in to prevent his father from hitting him and his siblings. The boy
testified that his father sometimes hit him for no reason, and did
the same to his mother and sister.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee questioned whether the defendants had
influenced the boy's testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-year-old, who is now living with his brother and maternal
grandparents, said he talks to his mother on the phone every other
night but that his feelings toward his father predated her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "I still love him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The boy added, however, that he became upset when his father
obtained a restraining order to prevent his sister from talking to
him from jail where she and Eileen Childs remain held in lieu of
$500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   After uttering the statement, the boy cried and buried his face in
his hands. Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis called a recess until
today.</TE>

<HD>SEC Clears Davis Aide, 2 Consultants of Energy Stock
Wrongdoing</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The press secretary for Gov. Gray Davis and two state energy
consultants have been cleared of wrongdoing by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The three had been under investigation over possible security
fraud violations for buying or selling energy company stock last
year.</LD>
<LD>   "This investigation has been terminated, and no enforcement action
has been recommended to the Commission," wrote Robert L. Mitchell,
SEC assistant district administrator, in a July 11 letter to Davis
Press Secretary Steven Maviglio.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC also informed Vikram Budhraja and Mark Skowronski, both
employees of Electric Power Group, that no enforcement action will be
taken against them. Stephen Kaufman, the Los Angeles attorney for
Budhraja and Skowronski, said he received a letter from the SEC on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena-based Electric Power Group won a $6.2-million contract
last year to assist the Department of Water Resources in buying
electricity for millions of customers of utilities crippled by the
electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Budhraja still works for the state as a consultant. Skowronski was
reassigned in December.</TE>
<TE>   Public disclosure forms filed by state energy consultants in the
summer of 2001 showed that Budhraja and Skowronski bought multiple
blocks of Edison International stock worth tens of thousands of
dollars in January 2001, just before Electric Power Group won its
state contract to help the state buy electricity for Edison, Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric customers.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2001, Maviglio purchased stock in Calpine Corp., a San
Jose-based power plant builder that had signed a multibillion-dollar,
long-term contract with the state in February. Maviglio sold the
stock, which was valued at $10,000 to $100,000, in August 2001.</TE>
<TE>   After a 10-month investigation, state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer in
May cleared state electricity buyers and consultants of any criminal
conflict of interest charges. There was no evidence that the power
buyers held significant stock or other financial interests in the
energy companies with which they did business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones had urged the attorney general and
SEC to probe possible violations by Davis administration consultants.</TE>

<HD>City's Grab for Church Land Thwarted</HD>
<DH>Courts: A federal judge temporarily halts Cypress' bid to
condemn Cottonwood property and let a Costco move in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a stinging 36-page opinion, a federal judge Tuesday ordered a
temporary halt to the city of Cypress' plan to condemn church
property in order to make way for a tax-generating Costco.</LD>
<LD>   "The framers of the Constitution ... might be surprised to learn
that the power of eminent domain was being used to turn the property
over to a private discount retail corporation," U.S. District Court
Judge David O. Carter wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling in favor of Cottonwood Christian Center's request for a
preliminary injunction is the first peek at the judge's leanings in a
national test case that weighs a city's redevelopment rights against
a church's free exercise of religion.</LD>
<TE>   In issuing the injunction, the judge said the 4,000-member
megachurch has demonstrated a "likelihood of success" in its lawsuit,
filed in January, against the city. He concluded that both major
prongs of the church's legal argument had merit: that the city lacked
a "compelling state interest" to condemn Cottonwood's 18 acres of
vacant property near the Los Alamitos Race Course for a private
interest, and that the city had infringed on the church's freedom of
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if [the city] had compelling reasons to burden Cottonwood's
religious exercise, they must do so in the least restrictive means,"
Carter said. "Far from doing that, the city has done the equivalent
of using a sledgehammer to kill an ant."</TE>
<TE>   City officials downplayed the significance of the judge's order,
saying they already have voluntarily suspended condemnation
proceedings while trying to work out a land swap with Cottonwood.
They also said the issues will be raised again when the church's
lawsuit against the city goes to trial, which is scheduled for March.</TE>
<TE>   "What this does is perpetuate the status quo," City Atty. William
Wynder said. "The next step is getting this case to trial."</TE>
<TE>   But Cottonwood attorney Kevin J. Hasson said the ruling will have
far-reaching implications.</TE>
<TE>   "In the bigger picture, this sends a signal across the nation that
it's not right to take a church's property," said Hasson, president
of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington-based group
that concentrates on religious freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been fighting for nearly two years over
property at the corner of Walker Street and Katella Avenue, the
busiest intersection in the city's 300-acre redevelopment zone.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood officials, seeking a new home for the expanding
congregation in neighboring Los Alamitos, paid $13 million for the
land in 1999. In October 2000, city officials rejected the church's
plans for the site, indicating they preferred office towers. More
recently, they decided they wanted a Costco on the lot.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood filed a federal suit in January, accusing the city of
discriminatory practices for stopping the church's plans in favor of
businesses that would provide the city with tax dollars. In May, the
church sought a temporary injunction in federal court after the City
Council unanimously voted to condemn the church's land.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Carter said he found Cypress' stated reasons for
taking the action--eliminating blight and generating tax
revenue--dubious.</TE>
<TE>   "At first blush, the city's concern about blighting rings hollow,"
Carter said, asking why the city didn't clean up the property for
more than a decade if this was the case. "Although some innocent
explanations are feasible--such as new leadership or robust economic
growth--the activity suggests that the city was simply trying to keep
Cottonwood out of the city, or at least from the use of its own
land."</TE>
<TE>   He also called the city's revenue concerns "even more suspect than
the concerns of blight," adding that Cypress has a 25% budget
surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's ruling pleased advocates of religious freedom, especially
for his citing of a religious land use act passed by Congress in 2000
to criticize the city's decision to seize the land. Also heartened
were constitutional conservatives who believe local government has
become too bold in taking private property to boost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This ruling is big because it continues a major trend of courts
starting to refuse to rubber-stamp redevelopment confiscations," said
Harold E. Johnson, an attorney with the Sacramento-based Pacific
Legal Foundation, a public interest firm that specializes in property
and individual rights. "When government's motive is merely to
transfer land to a favored developer or to fatten the government's
coffers, a condemnation action doesn't cut it constitutionally."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Laycock, a University of Texas law professor who
specializes in religious freedom, said: "This is pretty significant
because two constitutional issues are at stake: freedom of religion
and the proper use of eminent domain. There haven't been that many
cases like this and that's led to a widespread attitude with
government officials who believe churches exist [only with] their
permission."</TE>
<TE>   Cypress Councilman Tim Keenan said city officials haven't received
credit for agreeing to "a major concession. We are willing to take
the church into our community and we are willing to take more than 18
acres off our tax rolls."</TE>
<TE>   He also vowed to seek an out-of-court solution with Cottonwood,
the most promising being a land exchange involving property near the
Los Alamitos racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed, clearly," Keenan said. "The judge worked hard,
but I don't think he got it. But we're committed to a negotiated
settlement, and I hope the church doesn't use this for political
gain."</TE>
<TE>   John Shirey, executive director of the California Redevelopment
Assn. in Sacramento, said the case is unique because a church is
involved and likely won't affect many redevelopment decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "What should not be lost here is the impetus behind this whole
effort: local governments in this state trying to sustain themselves
and ... meet the unending demands of their citizens," he said.</TE>

<HD>Strawberry Again King in Ventura County</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Ventura County strawberries again overtook lemons to become the
region's premier crop in 2001 as local growers realized a third
consecutive year of sales exceeding $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The total value of fruits, nuts, vegetables, plants, livestock and
other agricultural production reached $1.05 billion last year, up
nearly $6.6 million from production totals the previous year,
according to county agricultural statistics released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this was a so-so year overall. But for a so-so year, we
did mighty well," said Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail. "If
not for strawberries and nursery stock [gains], the crop report would
have probably been down significantly."</LD>
<TE>   The overall figures underscore Ventura County's status as one of
the leading agricultural regions in California. McPhail estimates
that when statewide crop figures are released, the county will rank
in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Local growers of strawberries, potted plants and ornamental trees
and shrubs saw substantial increases in their harvests on average,
while those who farm lemons, grapefruit and vegetables--including
carrots, cucumbers, celery, lettuce and spinach--mostly saw a decline
in revenues, production, or both.</TE>
<TE>   "For the second time in some 50 years, lemons were not the top
crop," McPhail said. "But we think they will rebound."</TE>
<TE>   After dominating county crop statistics for decades, the gross
value of local lemons sold last year fell to $173.67 million, down
about 7.2% from $187.16 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The decline came despite increases in the amount of land
harvested--up 361 acres to 25,864 last year--and the number of lemons
picked. Last year's lemon production hit 490,969 tons, up 15,544 tons
from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   McPhail explained that more lemons available in supermarkets
pushed down the average price by more than 10% to $353.74 per ton. By
contrast, strawberry prices leaped nearly $151 per ton, up 15.7% to
$1,111.02.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 186 acres were dedicated to the juicy red berries
and more fruit was harvested per acre last year, allowing local
growers to sell 207,646 tons of strawberries for a total value of
$230.69 million, compared with 194,330 tons sold in 2000, valued at
$186.60 million.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Pidduck, who grows lemons and avocados in Santa Paula and
Oxnard, said a combination of factors hurt lemon sales in 2001--poor
weather, a drop in global demand for lemon juice and stiff
competition from overseas during the summer sales season.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Met Some Goals, Became Healthier City in '90s, Study
Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Over the decade ending in 2000, Los Angeles dramatically boosted its
public health ranking to 15th of the nation's 100 most populous
cities, up from 62nd in 1990, according to a study of national health
data released Tuesday by the State University of New York.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles achieved national goals set for five of 11 measures of
public health set by the U.S. surgeon general for the decade,
including posting sharp declines in the rates of AIDS, gonorrhea and
syphilis. In 1990, Los Angeles met only one of the surgeon general's
goals, according to the study.</LD>
<LD>   But neither Los Angeles nor the other 99 cities surveyed hit a
vital measure of public health: reducing the number of
low-birth-weight babies so that no more than five of every 100,000
newborns weigh less than 5 1/2 pounds. In fact, only two of the 100
biggest cities' suburbs--those of Stockton and Portland, Ore.--met
the goal set by the surgeon general.</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Andrulis, a report co-author, noted that the two cities and
many of the top 10 are centers of high-tech industry. The data, he
said, suggested they were able to translate wealth generated by high
tech into better public health.</TE>
<TE>   Low birth weight is a common indication of poor nutrition, illness
or smoking by expectant mothers. It can result in children with
long-term disabilities including cerebral palsy, autism and mental
retardation, the study's authors said. Cigarette smoking by expectant
mothers--long the usual explanation for low birth weights--declined
from 18% to 13% nationally during the 1990s, however.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that infant mortality declined 21% in cities
nationally--and 27% in Los Angeles--during the 1990s. But the United
States is still ranked 27th internationally, below Portugal and
Greece, for example, and on a par with Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   California's cities generally scored well on the new ranking. San
Jose tied with Portland, Ore., at the top of the list, with each
meeting eight of the 11 goals. San Diego (7) and Sacramento (6) also
scored higher than Los Angeles. Fresno, Oakland/Freemont, Santa
Ana/Anaheim and Stockton equaled Los Angeles with scores of 5.</TE>
<TE>   Among California cities, only Bakersfield, Riverside and San
Francisco finished below Los Angeles. Each met three of the 11
national goals.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials traced the improvement in the incidence of
sexually transmitted diseases to better public awareness campaigns,
increased use of protected sex and--for AIDS--the availability of new
drugs to prevent HIV-positive people from developing the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a decline ever since the drugs came on board in 1995 to
1996," said Jim Creeger, the chief of the HIV/AIDS registry at the
California Department of Health Services' AIDS office.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some recent trends trouble public health officials. In San
Francisco, where the rate of reported AIDS cases declined by
two-thirds in the 1990s, syphilis cases in the first six months of
this year more than doubled from the previous year, according to San
Francisco Department of Public Health records.</TE>
<TE>   And the existence of so many healthy HIV-positive people holds out
the potential for an outbreak of the disease if the new drugs lose
their effectiveness over time.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the syphilis rate has shot back up in Los Angeles since
2000. The rate jumped 37% in the first six months of this year
compared with the same period in 2001, according to the County
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   The murder rate--another of the public health measures--has turned
up locally and nationally since 2000.</TE>

<LD>A 16-year-old being held at Central Juvenile Hall in an armed robbery
case escaped from custody Tuesday while attending a medical
appointment at a nearby clinic, making him the fourth teenager to
flee the Lincoln Heights facility in a week, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Frazier escaped from a guard at a clinic associated with
the County-USC Medical Center, within walking distance from the
juvenile hall on Eastlake Avenue where he was held, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "While inside getting medical treatment he escaped from the
facility," said Officer Al Garcia of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Hollenbeck Division.</LD>
<TE>   The boy escaped about 11:30 a.m. while accompanied by a Probation
Department staff member, said Ken Kondo, spokesman for the county
Probation Department, which operates the juvenile halls.</TE>
<TE>   Kondo said he could not disclose further details about the
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   The escape comes less than a week after three teenagers, two of
them convicted murderers, used a handgun to overpower guards and
escape from the Eastlake Avenue facility using a small ladder and
bedsheets to climb over a 20-foot wall. The three remain at large.</TE>
<TE>   The latest escape came as the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors approved a motion by Mike Antonovich calling for the
Probation Department to produce a plan that would prevent escapes.</TE>
<TE>   Frazier was being held in an armed robbery case, police said.
Other law enforcement sources said he was convicted and was to be
transported soon to the California Youth Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Probation officials said security at the facility has been stepped
up since the July 31 escape of the three teenagers. All staff workers
must now pass through metal detectors when entering work to detect
any smuggled weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Argueta, 17, a gang leader convicted of murdering a rival,
used a .45-caliber handgun to lead the escape from the facility's
special housing unit.</TE>
<TE>   Argueta asked a guard to unlocked his door to allow him to get a
drink of water. Then he showed his gun and took three guards hostage.</TE>
<TE>   He forced one of the guards to open the rooms of convicted
murderer Marvin Sandoval, 17, and convicted carjacker Fernando
Nupiri, 18. They locked the guard in a utility room inside the unit
and used a 5-foot ladder and bedsheets tied like ropes to climb over
the wall, which is topped with razor wire.</TE>

<HD>Joshua Evans, 20; 3-Foot, 2-Inch Actor Starred in TV's
'Passions'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joshua Ryan Evans, who portrayed the 8-year-old version of actor Jim
Carrey in the motion picture "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," acted
as a child prodigy lawyer in television's "Ally McBeal" and was best
known as Timmy the living doll in the NBC soap opera "Passions," has
died. He was 20.</LD>
<LD>   Evans, who suffered from a rare growth disorder that limited his
adult height to 3 feet 2, died Monday in a San Diego hospital of
complications from a congenital heart condition, NBC officials
announced.</LD>
<LD>   The diminutive young man often said he chose acting because he
spent so much time watching movies and television while recuperating
from surgeries as a child.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, if it's all pretend, why can't I do that?" he told The
Times in 2000 when the Grinch movie was released.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Evans was already something of a cult figure for his role
as Timmy. The character, which he had portrayed since the inception
of "Passions" in 1999, is a doll turned into a real boy by a witch
named Tabitha.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press reported that in Monday's episode of the
soap--taped last month--Evans' character Timmy died. The NBC
announcement said future episodes have been edited to remove any
scenes that included Timmy.</TE>
<TE>   Evans earned two consecutive Soap Opera Digest Awards for
outstanding male scene stealer for the living-doll role.</TE>
<TE>   Even though his makeup as the young Grinch required 5 1/2 hours a
day--two more than for Carrey--Evans relished the role and working
with director and former child star Ron Howard. "It was wonderful,"
Evans told an interviewer. "Every time I got to see Ron it was an
honor."</TE>
<TE>   When the film was released nearly two years ago, Howard told The
Times that Evans' role as the furry green classroom misfit was
envisioned as a mere walk-on--until he met the tiny actor.</TE>
<TE>   "As it turned out, [Evans] was able to create a character and
generate a lot of heart for the story," Howard said then. " ... Josh
was just delightful."</TE>
<TE>   Evans was pint-sized lawyer Oren Koolie challenging series star
Calista Flockhart in two episodes of her "Ally McBeal" series in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   The native of Hayward, Calif., also played circus performer Tom
Thumb opposite Beau Bridges in the 1999 Arts and Entertainment cable
presentation of "P.T. Barnum" and was one of the toddlers in the 1999
film "Baby Geniuses" starring Kathleen Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Evans also appeared on "7th Heaven" and in Showtime's
"Poltergeist: The Legacy."</TE>
<TE>   The actor got his first break in show business at age 12 when he
was featured in a national commercial for Dreyer's ice cream titled
"The Dancing Baby." The commercial won a Cleo Award.</TE>
<TE>   Evans is survived by his parents, Chuck and Cheryl Evans; a
brother, James; and grandparents Gene and Belle Riding.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is pending. The family has asked that any
memorial donations be sent to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, P.O. Box
29119, Phoenix, AZ 85038-9119.</TE>

<HD>Jury to Get Case in Girl's Killing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>On the same day President Bush said the kidnapping and murder of
7-year-old Danielle van Dam is part of a "wave of horrible violence"
against the nation's children, the prosecutor and defense attorney
began closing arguments here Tuesday in the case of her accused
killer.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek told jurors that David Westerfield,
50, a self-employed design engineer, killed Danielle to satisfy
"primal needs" for sex with young girls and then tried to "hide,
destroy, conceal [and] wash the evidence."</LD>
<LD>   But defense lawyer Steven Feldman accused Dusek of distorting
comments made by Westerfield to police and mischaracterizing the
scientific evidence that appears to contradict the prosecutor's
theory about when Danielle was killed.</LD>
<TE>   And he repeated his assertion that her parents' lifestyle--which
included smoking marijuana and "swapping" partners with other
couples--endangered Danielle by bringing disreputable people into the
family home.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek took nearly four hours to summarize his case to the six men
and six women on the jury. Feldman had 90 minutes to begin his
closing argument and will continue Wednesday, when the high-profile
case is expected to go to the jury. If convicted, Westerfield faces a
possible death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's disappearance Feb. 2 from her parents' home in the
upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood was the first in a string of
criminal acts against children in recent months that have riveted and
horrified parents nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Bush announced a Sept. 24 conference at George
Washington University organized by the White House to find ways to
stem "a wave of horrible violence [against children] from twisted
criminals in our own communities."</TE>
<TE>   Bush mentioned two cases: Danielle van Dam and Samantha Runnion,
5, who was kidnapped from outside her Orange County home and
murdered.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to those cases and others, Bush said, "During weeks and
months we have prayed and worried with parents as their children have
been kidnapped [and], in some cases, murdered. The kidnapping or
murder of a child is every parent's worst nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Several factors conspired to make Danielle's case particularly
gut-wrenching.</TE>
<TE>   First, the body was not found for nearly a month, during which her
parents, Brenda and Damon van Dam, made repeated appeals on
television for her kidnapper to release her. And within days of the
disappearance police concluded that their only suspect was
Westerfield, who lives two doors away and had no history of violence
or improper overtures to children.</TE>
<TE>   On the night Danielle disappeared, Brenda was at a local bar for
several hours of dancing, drinking and marijuana smoking. "I'm not
casting aspersions," Feldman told jurors Tuesday. "This is the
lifestyle they chose to live, so be it. But when you do this, there
are risks."</TE>
<TE>   Dusek, however, told jurors that the parents' lifestyle was
irrelevant to the case: "All of the drugs, all of the alcohol, all of
the sex, that has nothing to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Dusek reminded jurors that criminalists and other experts
testified that Danielle's blood, hair and fingerprints were found in
Westerfield's home and his recreational vehicle. Feldman's major
defense is that Westerfield could not be the killer because the
girl's body was dumped days after Westerfield was put under 24-hour
surveillance by the police and media.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster that contention, Feldman presented two entomologists
who testified that the number and size of insects found on the corpse
suggested that it had been dumped there at least several days after
Feb. 5, when the surveillance began.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution presented two insect experts who disputed the
defense experts' conclusions.</TE>

<HD>Trial Set for Retired Doctor in Tax Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former Agoura Hills surgeon is accused of
filing bankruptcy to avoid paying $11 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Agoura Hills orthopedic surgeon charged with falsely filing
for bankruptcy to avoid paying $11 million in income taxes will go to
trial Sept. 24, federal officials said on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Robert A. Grant, 73, pleaded not guilty on Monday before Senior
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to a 23-count indictment handed
down last week by a federal grand jury. The former doctor is charged
with conspiracy, bankruptcy fraud and money laundering.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted on all counts, Grant faces a maximum of 390 years in
prison and a multimillion-dollar fine, Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Gary Tang said.</LD>
<TE>   Federal public defender Pedro Castillo, who is representing Grant,
said he would not comment on the case while litigation is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Grant owed more than $11 million in
federal taxes between 1979 and 1995 as well as substantial back taxes
to the state of California.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1995 bankruptcy filing, Grant allegedly failed to list all
his assets, in violation of federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend he set up "nominee corporations," or
businesses used to conceal the assets, that were owned and run by
other parties, Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   The corporations held Grant's assets, including 88 acres in Agoura
Hills valued at $5 million in 1990 and $4.5 million from his pension
fund, the indictment alleges.</TE>
<TE>   "He used the corporations to hide his assets from the bankruptcy
court and to transfer the assets back to him after he was cleared of
paying his creditors, including an $11-million tax bill," Tang said.</TE>

<LD>A Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday there is sufficient evidence for
a West Covina school board member to stand trial for allegedly lying
on a candidate's declaration about where he lived.</LD>
<LD>   Judge H. Chester Horn Jr., however, dismissed three other charges
against Peter Sabatino Jr., 48.</LD>
<LD>   Horn found there was insufficient evidence on two counts of
perjury prosecutors filed against Sabatino and a count of filing a
false candidate declaration in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Sabatino, a 13-year incumbent, has maintained he lives in a house
with his mother in Valinda, which is part of the West Covina Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, however, allege he lives in a Downey house he owns
and where his teenage son resides. State law requires school board
members and candidates to reside in their districts.</TE>

<HD>Union Votes to OK Strike Against MTA</HD>

<LD>The union representing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
bus and train supervisors announced Tuesday that it has voted to
authorize a strike if protracted contract talks aren't resolved soon.</LD>
<LD>   The vote, necessary because of state and federal labor laws
governing protocol for labor stoppages, was taken by members of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union.
Eighty-seven percent of the union's 136 members who voted gave
approval for the authorization, clearing way for the union to strike
if it chooses to do so, said Kevin McGrath, vice president of
AFSCME's Local 3634.</LD>
<LD>   The union has been locked in difficult negotiations with the MTA
over a labor contract for nearly two years, making little progress.</LD>
<TE>   Representing about 500 workers, union members make up only 5% of
the transit agency's work force. But its members, responsible for
such jobs as overseeing bus drivers, rail operators and maintenance
workers, are vital to keeping the MTA's bus and rail fleet running
efficiently. The union's workers make an average of $63,000 a year,
according to the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   While pay increases have been an issue, the most contentious
element of the talks has been the MTA's handling of benefits. The
union is pressing for retroactive changes that would boost pensions,
but the transit agency says such a move would be far too costly and
make little sense.</TE>
<TE>   If AFSCME workers strike, 2,000 members of the MTA's powerful
mechanics and maintenance workers union, the Amalgamated Transit
Union, would honor their picket lines, ATU President Neil Silver
said. Both unions are members of the AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   The union representing bus and rail drivers, the United
Transportation Union, would not comment. Tension between the UTU and
AFSCME emerged during the nearly monthlong strike in 2000, when some
AFSCME members crossed the drivers' picket lines.</TE>
<TE>   An important backdrop to the AFSCME dispute is that negotiations
are soon to begin with the mechanics union, followed by talks next
year with the drivers union.</TE>

<HD>Population Growth Prompts a New Look at San Onofre's
Evacuation Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday won approval to
create a new evacuation plan for residents living near the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors agreed to spend $100,000 for the updated
plan, which officials said is needed because of the growing
population throughout southern Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The current plan places reception and care centers at five
locations where the public would go in the event of a malfunction or
attack at San Onofre.</LD>
<TE>   Those centers are at UC Irvine, Tustin and Santa Ana high schools,
Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and Edison High School in
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they would like to reduce the number of centers,
arguing that they can better pool resources and provide more
efficient service at from one to three reception areas.</TE>
<TE>   The locations of these centers have not yet been chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a better use of resources," said sheriff's Capt.
Catherine Zurn.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Golden, a spokesman for San Onofre's owner, Southern
California Edison, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This will improve the evacuation plan in that it will reduce the
number of care centers, but will be much better equipped to handle
the increased capacity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Safety issues at San Onofre have received much attention after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The federal government has said nuclear
power plants are a possible terrorist target.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the state announced it would provide potassium iodide
pills to residents living near the power plant--part of a nationwide
project launched after Sept. 11. The pills are designed to reduce
some health effects of radiation exposure.</TE>
<TE>   The study, to be completed by ABS Consulting, will also look at
traffic flow to the evacuation sites, the number of emergency
officials needed for the sites and the capacity of each facility.</TE>
<TE>   Currently the San Onofre emergency plan includes a community alert
system with a network of 49 pole-mounted sirens in a 10-mile radius
of the plant.</TE>
<TE>   If radiation is released, the sirens will warn residents to turn
on a TV or radio, where they will get instructions.</TE>
<TE>   The alert will advise residents either to stay in their houses or
evacuate to the nearest reception and care center.</TE>
<TE>   "Residents should be appreciative that the emergency plan is not a
static document ... and that we are constantly looking at ways of
improving it," Golden said.</TE>

<HD>Schoolteacher Is Arrested on Child Pornography Charge</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Westlake Village elementary school teacher was arrested on
suspicion of possession of child pornography, authorities said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested James Robertson, 56, a
longtime teacher at White Oak School, at his Thousand Oaks home
Monday afternoon. He was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of
$10,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson's arrest followed a weeklong investigation resulting
from an anonymous tip, sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities served a search warrant at Robertson's home and seized
computer files, pornographic photos and stories written about sex
with minors, Nishimoto said. Authorities believe the material was
commercially generated, not created by Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Possession of child pornography by a person with no prior
conviction is a misdemeanor, Nishimoto said, punishable by a $2,000
fine or up to a year in County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office had not filed charges by late
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Hanke, assistant superintendent in charge of personnel for
the Las Virgenes Unified School District, which oversees the school
where Robertson works, said officials will not make a decision about
the teacher's future with the district until formal charges are
filed.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson taught fourth- and fifth-graders last year, according to
the White Oak School's Web site.</TE>

<HD>Darrell Porter, 50; All-Star Catcher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Former major league All-Star catcher Darrell Porter, who was the most
valuable player of the 1982 World Series with the St. Louis
Cardinals, has died in suburban Kansas City. He was 50.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Porter's body was found Monday evening lying near his
car in La Benite Park, where he apparently went to relax and read a
newspaper. They said that no foul play was suspected and that an
autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   Porter, who lived in the Kansas City suburb of Lee's Summit, hit
.247 with 188 home runs and 826 runs batted in in 17 major league
seasons with Milwaukee, Kansas City, St. Louis and Texas.</LD>
<TE>   His best season came in 1979, when he set career highs by hitting
.291 with 20 homers and 112 RBIs for the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Porter started his major league career with the Brewers in 1971,
and was traded to the Royals after the 1976 season. He was an
All-Star twice in his four years with Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   During spring training in 1980, Porter checked into a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center. He returned to the team, but
his production dropped, with his average falling to .249. However, he
was still a key factor in helping the Royals reach their first World
Series--which they lost to Philadelphia in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Porter chronicled his struggle with addiction and recovery in a
1984 book, "Snap Me Perfect! The Darrell Porter Story."</TE>
<TE>   He filed for free agency after the season and signed with St.
Louis to play for Whitey Herzog, his manager in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Porter struggled in his first two seasons at St. Louis, but was
the National League championship series and World Series MVP in 1982
when the Cardinals beat the Brewers in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   He played in his third World Series when the Cardinals lost to the
Royals in 1985. Porter then spent two seasons with the Rangers before
retiring in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Porter had recently shown interest in getting into baseball
broadcasting. He was at the Royals' spring training camp this year
and spent time in the broadcast booth during the team's last home
stand to get some tips from the Royals' radio team of Denny Matthews
and Ryan LeFebvre.</TE>
<TE>   Art Stewart, senior advisor to Kansas City Royals General Manager
Allard Baird, told the Kansas City Star the news of Porter's death
was "very, very upsetting."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately known.</TE>

<HD>Statewide Test Results Delayed by L.A. Unified</HD>
<DH>Stanford 9: Scores can't be completed by Aug. 15 because
the district failed to meet a deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District turned in nearly half of its
Stanford 9 answer sheets two weeks after a July 1 deadline, forcing a
delay in the release of statewide test scores until the end of this
month, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Unified failed to send 250,000 of 530,000 answer sheets by
the deadline to the test scorer, NCS Pearson in Iowa City. The
company did not have time to compute the data so that they could be
released by the state over the Internet on Aug. 15, as planned.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the state Department of Education announced Tuesday that
it had postponed releasing the scores--for individual schools,
districts, counties and the state--until Aug. 29.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very serious mistake," said L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer,
who promised disciplinary action against those responsible. "I'm very
disappointed that the organization failed."</TE>
<TE>   The 250,000 late answer sheets account for 5% of the 4.5 million
tests given statewide last spring in grades 2 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   Delaine Eastin, state superintendent of public instruction, said
that computing the scores with data missing from Los Angeles would
have thrown off statewide results.</TE>
<TE>   "I have expressed to Supt. ... Romer my deep disappointment in
LAUSD's lack of promptness," Eastin said in a statement. "We regret
any inconvenience that may result from this change."</TE>
<TE>   The two-week delay will not keep other districts from getting
their test scores directly from the scoring company. Many districts
already have received their scores and have sent individual students'
results home to parents, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parents of L.A. Unified students already have received
individual students' results. But those with children at schools that
missed the July 1 deadline will receive them in the last week of
August.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the breakdown occurred at four testing centers,
scattered throughout the district, that collect answer sheets from
schools. Those centers, he said, were overwhelmed by the sheer volume
of paperwork coming in at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, he said, the centers struggled to meet new
demands, including a state requirement to assemble blank answer
sheets for students who did not take the test. Those students either
were absent or were exempted at their parents' request.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, clerks at the centers had to meet with school
testing coordinators to identify students who had missed the test,
Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the testing centers' staff failed to ask for help or
notify district headquarters in time to correct the problem by the
July 1 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   He learned about the missed deadline three weeks after the fact,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said that because the answer sheets remained in the
district's hands longer than anticipated, he has asked the district's
inspector general to ensure that there was no tampering. He said he
believes there were no breaches of security.</TE>
<TE>   State education officials said the delay will not affect the
release of other testing data in the coming months. Romer said L.A.
Unified will have to pay about $50,000 for NCS Pearson to rerun the
test scores with the late batch from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School Board member David Tokofsky said the
delayed test scores will hamper schools from analyzing academic
progress and placing students this fall in the right classes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is disruptive to schools," he said. "I am deeply apologetic
to everyone who is adversely affected by this," he said.</TE>

<HD>Police Unions Launch Anti-Secession Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two unions that represent Los Angeles police officers staged a rally
Tuesday against secession by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood,
launching a well-funded campaign to paint the breakup proposals as a
threat to crime fighting.</LD>
<LD>   The rally by the Police Protective League and the Command Officers
Assn. attracted about 200 officers to the league's athletic field
near Dodger Stadium. The two organizations represent more than 9,000
employees of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very confident Hollywood and the Valley will see it's in
their best interest to stay with this great city and this great
Police Department," said Capt. Jim Tatreau, association president.</LD>
<TE>   Secession leaders argue that Valley and Hollywood cities would
provide better police service by deploying more officers to the
regions. They also contend that the unions are opposing secession in
the hope that the city will reward them with better contracts if the
breakup measures lose on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are playing out their role of supporting their bosses,
who are the mayor and City Council," said Sharon Jimenez of the
Hollywood Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally, Police Protective League President Mitzi Grasso
presented Mayor James K. Hahn with a $100,000 check for his
anti-secession campaign. She said the union plans to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars more on TV and radio spots attacking
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The Command Officers Assn., which represents LAPD supervisors,
will contribute an undisclosed sum to the campaign against Hollywood
secession, Tatreau said. The association plans to work with an
anti-secession group headed by City Councilmen Tom LaBonge and Eric
Garcetti.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau said a Valley city would likely have trouble assigning the
large number of detectives and officers who worked on cases such as
the May 2001 slaying of actor Robert Blake's wife. Blake was arrested
and charged in the Studio City killing after 15 detectives
interviewed more than 150 witnesses in 20 states, the captain said.</TE>
<TE>   "No small city could put that number of detectives into a case
without turning itself upside-down," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, chairman of the Valley secession campaign, noted
that a Valley city would be the nation's sixth largest and have an
annual budget of nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The sixth-largest city certainly will have the resources to do
whatever it needs to do and provide public safety at least at the
level currently provided, if not better," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   If secession wins, LAPD officers would patrol the new cities
during a transition, after which the cities would have the option of
contracting with the LAPD or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, or of setting up their own police agencies.</TE>

<HD>Police Unions Launch Anti-Secession Fight</HD>
<DH>Rally: Saying the new cities would threaten public safety,
one group promises funds for TV and radio attack ads.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two unions that represent Los Angeles police officers staged a rally
Tuesday against secession by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood,
launching a well-funded campaign to paint the breakup proposals as a
threat to crime fighting.</LD>
<LD>   The rally by the Police Protective League and the Command Officers
Assn. attracted about 200 officers to the league's athletic field
near Dodger Stadium. The two organizations represent more than 9,000
employees of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very confident Hollywood and the Valley will see it's in
their best interest to stay with this great city and this great
Police Department," said Capt. Jim Tatreau, association president.</LD>
<TE>   Secession leaders argue that Valley and Hollywood cities would
provide better police service by deploying more officers to the
regions. They also contend that the unions are opposing secession in
the hope that the city will reward them with better contracts if the
breakup measures lose on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are playing out their role of supporting their bosses,
who are the mayor and City Council," said Sharon Jimenez of the
Hollywood Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally, Police Protective League President Mitzi Grasso
presented Mayor James K. Hahn with a $100,000 check for his
anti-secession campaign. She said the union plans to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars more on television and radio spots attacking
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The Command Officers Assn., which represents LAPD supervisors,
will contribute an undisclosed sum to the campaign against Hollywood
secession, Tatreau said. The association plans to work with an
anti-secession group headed by City Councilmen Tom LaBonge and Eric
Garcetti.</TE>
<TE>   Tatreau said a Valley city would likely have trouble assigning the
large number of detectives and officers who worked on cases such as
the May 2001 slaying of actor Robert Blake's wife. Blake was arrested
and charged in the Studio City killing after 15 detectives
interviewed more than 150 witnesses in 20 states, the captain said.</TE>
<TE>   "No small city could put that number of detectives into a case
without turning itself upside-down," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, chairman of the Valley secession campaign, said
that a Valley city would be the nation's sixth largest and have an
annual budget of nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The sixth-largest city certainly will have the resources to do
whatever it needs to do and provide public safety at least at the
level currently provided, if not better," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   If secession wins, LAPD officers would patrol the new cities
during a transition, after which the cities would have the option of
contracting with the LAPD for continued service. The cities could
also contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department or set
up their own police agencies, which the unions have said could lead
to LAPD layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, City Controller Laura Chick said on Tuesday that she
has decided to oppose secession. "The millions of dollars which would
be required to split the city apart are dollars that should be going
to providing needed services to the people of Los Angeles," said
Chick, who formerly represented the West Valley on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, the number of potential candidates who have taken
out papers to run for the Valley city council and mayor's office
reached 107, although only 25 have filed them. The deadline for
filing is Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 12 prospective mayoral candidates had filed petitions
as of Tuesday. Among the new contenders is Mel Wilson, former
president of the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, four candidates for council had filed petitions by
Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>A flood and fire aboard the Navy research submarine Dolphin that led
the captain to order sailors to abandon ship was the result of the
wrong gasket being installed on what should have been a watertight
door, a Navy report concluded Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphin was 100 miles off San Diego on May 21 when water began
gushing inside, causing a fire in the electrical system. The
submarine was towed back to San Diego for repairs.</LD>
<LD>   A report by submarine experts with the U.S. Pacific Fleet
criticized crew members for not noticing the improper gasket,
although it also commended several sailors for bravery in fighting
the fire and flooding.</LD>

<HD>Edgar Stueve, 86; One of 2 Alta Dena Dairy Founders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Stueve, who with his brother Harold founded Alta Dena Dairy in
1945 with 61 cows and a milk wagon and built it into what was at one
time the largest dairy in the world with 18,000 cows, has died. He
was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Stueve died Thursday at his Monrovia home of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born into a Missouri family of 18 children, Stueve and the others
followed eldest brother Elmer to Southern California to work in the
burgeoning dairy industry.</LD>
<TE>   While Elmer completed his World War II military service, Edgar and
Harold formed the nucleus of Alta Dena, specializing in raw or
unpasteurized milk.</TE>
<TE>   Elmer, who died in 1992, bought an Army surplus truck, Alta Dena's
first motorized vehicle, and went on to manage construction and
maintenance aspects of the dairy while Edgar and Harold concentrated
on animal husbandry and business. The company has employed as many as
70 family members at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The family also owned Stueve Bros. Farms for more than half a
century. The manufacturing operation was sold in 1989, but new owners
continued to produce raw milk under the brand name Stueve's Natural
in the family's honor for another decade. Litigation and legislation
over their sale of raw milk, and claims that it caused cases of
salmonella and listeria poisoning, forced the Stueves to sell most of
their Chino farmland three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the years of controversy, Edgar and Harold Stueve
consistently worked to assure that their operations set the standard
for clean dairy farming. In 1953, they began paying a Medical Milk
Commission to inspect their herds and bottling plants and certify
their raw milk as safe. Los Angeles County made the commission a part
of local government in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Stueve served on the Milk Producers Council in Chino, and
was active for more than 60 years in the First Lutheran Church of
Monrovia.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother Harold, he is survived by his wife,
Bee; daughters Jackie Arthur and Jean Behrend; brothers Erwin,
Harlen, John, Martin, Melvin, Richard and Wilbert; sisters Edna Moll,
Irene Wilson, Manda Petzoldt, Marlene Unger and Wilma Arambwel; five
grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled at 11 a.m. today at First Lutheran Church,
1323 S. Magnolia Ave., Monrovia. The family has asked that any
memorial contributions be made to that church or to a charity of the
donor's choice.</TE>

<HD>Bond Issue Would Aid Arts Centers</HD>
<DH>Measure: Money to help renovate two L.A. County museums and
build two other facilities would first have to be matched by $250
million from private donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE and WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to
authorize a ballot measure for a proposed $250-million bond issue
that would pay to upgrade several county science and cultural
institutions with an unusual blend of public and private dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The board unanimously approved a measure for the November ballot
that would allow the issuance of general obligation bonds to fund
earthquake and fire safety improvements at eight locations--but only
if another $250 million is first raised through private donations.</LD>
<LD>   At a time of county budget austerity, the infusion of $500 million
would be a windfall for cultural and artistic venues that often have
endured budget cutbacks.</LD>
<TE>   Critics, however, argue that the county should not subsidize those
institutions when it is asking voters to consider raising their taxes
to pay for the local health-care system.</TE>
<TE>   Among the institutions that would benefit from the measure--which
requires approval by two-thirds of voters--are the county's Natural
History Museum and Museum of Art and Music Center, as well as
proposed performing arts centers at Cal State Northridge and in the
San Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art would have to raise $112.5 million each to obtain bond
contributions of $98 million, while the Music Center and planned
performing arts center at Cal State Northridge would have to raise
private contributions of $10 million and $15 million, respectively,
to receive matching dollar-for-dollar public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a bond measure issued by a government agency
whose issuance is conditioned on the prior receipt of an equal or
greater match of private money," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Though backers praised the linkage of public support to private
contributions, critics said it was risky--and warned that it might
encourage opposition to another measure on the November ballot: a
proposal to impose a parcel tax to fund the county health system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in an economically uncertain time, and we're seeing state
and local governments loading up on tax increases," said Kris
Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. "If
the county's primary goal is to get more money for trauma centers, I
think it's a mistake to put something else on the ballot that would
raise homeowner taxes."</TE>
<TE>   The county auditor-controller estimated that the bond measure for
cultural institutions would require the owner of a $250,000 home to
pay $6.96 the first year and $6.04 the second year. In subsequent
years the payment would decline if county real estate assessments
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the public dollars would be used to retrofit older
facilities like portions of the Natural History Museum, which was
built in 1913, and the 40-year-old Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   But they are planning major renovations, and much of the money
slated for "improvements" essentially could be used to subsidize new
construction.</TE>
<TE>   If it passes, the bond measure also would provide $15 million
toward a proposed $75-million performing arts center at Cal State
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   The university's theater seats about 500 people. At 1,600 seats,
the new venue's size would rival that of UCLA's Royce Hall and the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   The university will use higher-education bonds and launch a
fund-raising effort for the remaining $60 million needed for the new
theater, Cal State Northridge President Jolene Koester said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the project has been part of the campus master plan
for many years, and will proceed whether or not the November bond
measure passes.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would require the Natural History Museum and
Museum of Art to increase free admissions for children and free tours
to schoolchildren by 50% over their respective 2001-2002 levels
before receiving bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Pisano, president of the Natural History Museum, said the
bond money would be an "enormous help" for a planned renovation
expected to cost up to $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tremendous gesture on behalf of the county,"
Pisano said.</TE>
<TE>   "These institutions provide common ground and opportunities for
lifetime learning."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Vote to Seek Full Navy Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Land use: Orange County supervisors unanimously back a
ballot measure to urge stricter detoxifying of the closed Marine air
station before its sale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County voters in November will be asked to urge the Navy to
completely clean the former El Toro Marine base before it is sold,
thrusting the issue of toxic pollution on the site to center stage as
redevelopment plans proceed.</LD>
<LD>   The base, which closed in July 1999, is on the federal Superfund
list as one of the nation's most polluted sites. The Nov. 5 ballot
measure asks the Navy to reconcile its cleanup plan for El Toro with
studies by Irvine and the county contention that the Navy's plan is
inadequate.</LD>
<LD>   The move Tuesday to involve voters was unanimous among county
supervisors--a rarity in El Toro's tumultuous eight-year planning
history.</LD>
<TE>   Public attention on the 4,700-acre base has focused on whether it
should be rebuilt as a commercial airport. Voters in March grounded
that plan, instead approving zoning for a large urban park.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed Tuesday that a swift and complete cleanup of El
Toro transcends arguments over what should be built there.</TE>
<TE>   A public call for full cleanup could resonate beyond Orange
County. Congress is moving toward approving more military base
closings in 2005, meaning more communities would be eyeing the Navy's
record at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who drafted the
measure, said the county has an obligation to ensure the Navy cleans
the land before it is sold.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected pollution discovered at other closed bases has stalled
redevelopment and added millions of dollars in costs.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy plans to dispose of the base by auctioning it off to
developers next year. The winning bidders will be permitted to build
on 16% of El Toro and will have to donate the rest for public use as
a condition of sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience at other bases should be a wake-up call to this board
and taxpayers throughout the county," Coad said. "This gives
developers a fair shake too, so they know what they're getting."</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday on the ballot
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Passage would put pressure on the Navy to defend its cleanup plan,
said Greg Hurley, an environmental attorney and past chairman of the
El Toro environmental review board.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's plan was approved while El Toro was still slated to
become an airport. Irvine now hopes to annex the base and expand the
amount of development. The 4,000 acres that developers will be
required to set aside for public use as part of Irvine's plan would
become a "Great Park," with golf courses, playing fields, a
university, a cultural complex and a cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors don't "want the legacy of being the people
behind the bench when the biggest environmental catastrophe in the
county went by them," Hurley said. "It gets Irvine residents thinking
about it too. They have to be very careful about what they decide to
do out there because it could easily bankrupt the city."</TE>
<TE>   Some say the ballot measure is a move to shame the Navy into doing
a more thorough review of El Toro. If there was no record of
hazardous substances on a section of the base, for example, the Navy
didn't test the area, according to the Navy's own review. The Navy
barred the county from taking its own soil samples.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an attempt to put political pressure on them," said Aimee
Houghton, associate director of the Center for Public Environmental
Oversight, a Northern California group that monitors base cleanup
nationwide. "One of the biggest lessons people have learned is to get
assurances upfront that they will be getting cleanup consistent with
their land-use plan for the base."</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, San Francisco voters overwhelmingly passed a
similar referendum demanding the Navy do a better job of cleaning up
Hunters Point, a shipyard on San Francisco Bay that was closed in
1977 and that is also on the Superfund list. Cleanup of Hunters Point
remains unfinished.</TE>
<TE>   "[The measure] passed, but we can't say for certain that it had an
effect," Houghton said. "If the Navy was susceptible to these kinds
of things, they never would have let themselves get to the point they
are at with these bases."</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Installation Developers, a Washington group
that advises communities on the base conversion process, has been
pushing the military to release better information about contaminants
on bases early on.</TE>
<TE>   "You are having ballot measures and things like that because
communities are not always getting quality information," said Tim
Ford, the association's deputy executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, political pressure is the only way to get the
government to act, said Gene Stuard, vice president of the Forrestale
Group, based in Louisiana. The company assesses the damage to
property caused by contamination. Orange County's ballot measure is
an "excellent approach to the problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State environmental officials wouldn't comment on the ballot
measure, but said they will conduct confirmation field tests on the
base before allowing it to be transferred to private ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have to go back and clean anything that is still
contaminated or we won't approve the transfer," said Ron Baker,
spokesman for the Department of Toxic Substances at the California
Environmental Protection Agency. If contamination is found later, the
Navy will have to come back and remove it.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who fought the airport but backed Coad's
ballot measure, said he will campaign for its passage. But that still
won't assure complete cleanup at El Toro, where toxic dumping took
place for 56 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The base will never be fully cleaned up," Spitzer said. "I don't
know if it is even scientifically or economically possible."</TE>

<HD>Serial Rapist Has Women on Guard</HD>
<DH>Torrance: Their sense of security shaken since brazen
daylight attacks, they warily go about their business. 'It's just
scary,' one resident says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a week after Torrance police announced that a serial rapist
was stalking the town, women throughout the quiet South Bay community
warily go about their business.</LD>
<LD>   They run errands, return books to the library and take their daily
walks in the park, knowing that the rapist attacks in broad daylight
when most people feel a certain sense of security. But for some
women, that sense of security has been shaken.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just scary," Christine Doran, 30, said as she and a friend
power-walked around the baseball diamond at Charles H. Wilson Park on
Crenshaw Boulevard. "The fact that he's willing to do this during the
day means he has no fear."</LD>
<TE>   Brazen is the word authorities have used to describe the rapist,
who has sexually assaulted two women in five weeks by luring them
close enough to his car to brandish a handgun and kidnap them. Two
other women were able to run away from him July 4 and July 22.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed his latest victim--a 16-year-old girl on her way to
work--about 3:30 p.m. July 29.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents occurred in residential and commercial areas
throughout the city. Except for the attempted kidnapping at 10 p.m.
on July 22, all of the attacks took place in daylight hours. In the
first three crimes, the man carried a handgun, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The rapist gets the women close enough to his car to scare them
with his gun and then kidnaps them, said Lt. Patrick Shortall.</TE>
<TE>   He does not drive them very far, but police would not say if the
women had been raped inside his vehicle. Two vehicles have been used
in the crimes--a compact silver car and a white van.</TE>
<TE>   Women interviewed say they were relying on common sense to avoid
an encounter with the rapist. They no longer walk alone, even in
daylight, and they strictly adhere to that old rule about never
talking to strangers.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't stop to give anyone directions, that's for sure," said Mary
K. Balding, 36. "I've just become more aware of everyone around me,
and I've warned my 9-year-old not to approach anybody's car."</TE>
<TE>   When Peggy Enriquez heard news reports about a rapist in her town,
she asked some police officer friends for advice.</TE>
<TE>   Their advice was basically not to walk alone, she said. She used
to go for nightly walks, but she said she can't find anyone who will
accompany her, so those have stopped. "I really wanted to get back
into it, but not now, not with everything that's going on," Enriquez
said.</TE>
<TE>   News that a rapist lurked close by has disturbed Danelle Bell's
daughter, Jaclyn, so much that the 9-year-old has taken to constantly
checking to see if doors and windows are locked.</TE>
<TE>   Jaclyn doesn't understand what rape is, but after months of
hearing about child abductions throughout Southern California, the
little girl is concerned about being kidnapped, her mother said.
"It's really affected her," Bell said. "We'll be driving along and
she'll look for a white van or a guy who looks like who they showed
on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Other women, such as Rose Hosta, 68, said they are not concerned.
"I go out alone all the time, but I'm not worried because I think
he's after the younger ladies," Hosta said as she geared up for her
daily walk.</TE>
<TE>   All of the victims range in age from their late teens to early
30s, but police have warned that none of them shared any specific
physical characteristics, and that all women should be on alert.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of sexual assaults do happen to younger women, but
any woman is a potential victim," said Jennifer Luck, a spokeswoman
for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women.</TE>
<TE>   Police have posted the rapist's composite sketch around town, and
are warning women to be extra careful and cognizant of their
surroundings</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of irons in the fire," Shortall said. "People are
still calling and we're relying on them for any information. Every
tip is important."</TE>
<TE>   The assailant is described as African American, 23 to 40 years
old, with a stocky build, shaved head and light mustache.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Torrance Police
Department at (310) 618-5586 or (310) 328-3456.</TE>

<HD>UC Seeks to Ease Curbs on Patient Research</HD>
<DH>Health: A bill has passed Assembly. Critics say the
university has failed to protect earlier subjects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California and several health groups are lobbying
the Legislature for more leeway to enroll incapacitated patients in
research studies.</LD>
<LD>   But patient activists say the UC system doesn't deserve this new
authority because of its previous lapses in protecting human research
subjects in medical experiments. And bioethicists worry that the
legislation could place patients at risk for exploitation.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which passed the Assembly and is headed to the Senate as
early as today, would allow certain relatives, from spouses to the
closest available family member, to approve studies involving
patients unable to give consent. Such patients might include victims
of strokes or Alzheimer's disease, or those in comas.</LD>
<TE>   The university, along with such groups as the American Heart Assn.
and California chapters of the Alzheimer's Assn., said more
flexibility is needed to advance treatment of life-threatening
diseases and injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's advocates also seek greater clarity: The consent laws
are open to interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law allows any "legally appointed representative" to give
consent on behalf of an incapacitated patient, leaving interpretation
of that term to individual states. California law is more
restrictive, giving authority only to those appointed by the courts
or legally approved by the patients before incapacitation. The
state's definition may or may not include close relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is "a bit of a mess," said Regis Kelly, executive
vice chancellor of UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Individual UC campuses and other research institutions interpret
the laws in various ways. In April, acting on legal advice, UCLA
issued a moratorium that bars researchers from enrolling patients in
studies if they cannot give consent. But other UC campuses allow such
research if a relative consents.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the precise meaning of the law have arisen as
research institutions nationwide have come under fire in recent years
for controversial studies, some of which have led to deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The California bill would create a list of relatives who could
give consent for a patient who is incapacitated.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could make somebody better or give them relief, why
wouldn't we want to do that?" asked Assemblywoman Dion Aroner
(D-Berkeley), who co-authored the bill.</TE>
<TE>   But Aroner, whose mother had Alzheimer's disease, said after
conferring with patient advocates that "there are some issues here
that need to be dealt with still. It's not a black-and-white issue."</TE>
<TE>   Some patient advocates are suspicious. "This is like a grab for
more power" by UC, said Vera Hassner Sharav, president of the
Alliance for Human Research Protection. "In fact, they haven't earned
it at all. They haven't complied with the existing regulations and
law."</TE>
<TE>   She and other critics said the UC system has a history of
violating the rights of patients involved in research.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, UCLA was reprimanded by federal officials for failing to
get proper informed consent from patients enrolled in a clinical
trial of a new anti-schizophrenia drug. One patient committed
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, three doctors at UC Irvine were accused of taking
the eggs and embryos of patients without their consent and implanting
them in other women, some of whom gave birth.</TE>
<TE>   Since June 2001, the U.S. Office of Human Research Protections has
criticized UCLA, UC Irvine and UC San Francisco for minor instances
of failing to inform subjects of their risks in experiments.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said they have made every attempt to rectify past
problems, and the federal office has expressed satisfaction with each
campus' efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go back a few years anywhere in the country, [the
protections] would not meet the standards of today," said William
Parker, vice chancellor for research at UC Irvine. "We've made
improvements since then."</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Fried, a UC lobbyist and analyst in Sacramento, said the
university and other sponsors of the legislation have tried to
address opponents' concerns. They have made several changes,
including eliminating patients involuntarily committed to mental
hospitals as research subjects.</TE>
<TE>   With opponents who remain, she said, "I think we've gotten down to
a philosophical difference as to whether human beings should be
involved in this kind of research at all."</TE>
<TE>   The American Stroke Assn. is a strong advocate of the bill, saying
that the ability to get patients the most up-to-date treatment is
urgently needed.</TE>
<TE>   "When a patient presents at the emergency room, the most
appropriate treatment for that patient is often still in an
experimental state," said Marc Burgat, a legislative advocate for the
stroke association in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to have the law very specifically clarified,"
Burgat said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Aller, whose son participated in the schizophrenia study
at UCLA in 1990, said he still doesn't trust UC researchers. During
the study, Aller's son Greg, who had been taken off antipsychotic
medication without his knowledge, came to believe voices in his head
that ordered him to kill the former president, Aller has said.</TE>
<TE>   "The lessons learned and the integrity for the individual ...
don't seem to be taken to heart really," said Aller, who with his son
is suing the university for not properly advising Greg Aller of
potential risks in the research.</TE>
<TE>   The case, closely watched by researchers, is set for trial in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Bioethicists said it is premature to change the California law. So
far, they said, studies have shown that family members and doctors
are poor predictors of what treatments patients actually want.</TE>
<TE>   "What gives me pause is that there has not been any real public
discussion of whether this is something that society wants to
sanction or not," said Jonathan Moreno, director of the Center for
Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Another bioethicist, George Annas of the Boston University School
of Public Health, would insist upon a host of changes in the proposed
law.</TE>
<TE>   One would be that every incapacitated patient have an independent
physician who agreed that the study would not cause harm.</TE>
<TE>   And the legislation should prevent relatives from being paid "to
volunteer somebody else for an experiment," Annas said.</TE>
<TE>   Bioethicists said UC is not the only university system to be
criticized for research protections.</TE>
<TE>   Alleging serious violations, the federal government in the last
three years temporarily suspended all research involving humans at
several schools, including Duke University and Johns Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the most advanced research centers seem to have the worst
problems, probably because they have some of the most aggressive
researchers going after diseases," said USC bioethicist Alexander
Capron.</TE>

<CX>   Medical research--A story in the Aug. 7 California section
mischaracterized a study at UCLA in which patients were withdrawn
from medication for schizophrenia. The study involved a drug approved
decades ago by the Food and Drug Administration, not a new
medication. UCLA also disputes Bob Aller's assertion that his son,
Greg, was withdrawn from the medication without his knowledge. In
addition, the article should have said that a patient who committed
suicide had ended his active participation in the study, although he
was still involved in follow-up research.</CX>

<LD>A Ventura bank was robbed Tuesday by a man who handed a teller a note
demanding money and warning that he had a gun, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The robber, who left with an undisclosed amount of cash, entered
the Washington Mutual branch in the 3400 block of Telegraph Road
shortly after 12:30 p.m. and handed the teller an envelope containing
the note, FBI Special Agent Leane Blevins said. Witnesses described
the robber as heavyset with dark hair and possibly a mustache,
Blevins said</LD>
<LD>   The holdup was the fourth bank robbery in less than two weeks in
Ventura County and the 15th this year. Blevins said investigators are
"90% positive" the robber is the same man who robbed a Mid-State Bank
in Camarillo on July 26.</LD>

<HD>Ventura Adopts New Student Daytime Curfew</HD>
<DH>Truancy: Council votes for ordinance over parents' protests
and litigation concerns. Police will have power to issue citations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beginning Sept. 5, it will be illegal for Ventura youths to be on the
streets between 8 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on school days.</LD>
<LD>   Despite protests from parents and concerns raised by one official
over possible lawsuits, a split City Council on Monday adopted a
daytime curfew called the Safe Students Ordinance.</LD>
<LD>   "I am absolutely confident that this ordinance will prove to be an
effective tool for our officers" to combat truancy, Police Chief Mike
Tracy told the council. The panel voted 5 to 2 in favor of the
ordinance.</LD>
<TE>   According to district officials, school attendance rates have
increased over the last three years--from 94.5% to 95.2%--because of
measures already in place. In fact, officials said, reductions in
truancy during the last year helped the school district recoup an
extra $750,000 in its budget.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Bradford, director of administration support services for
the Ventura Unified School District, estimates that only about 1% of
absent students actually are truant.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new ordinance, school-age youths could be stopped and
questioned by police if they are found off campus. If the youth has
skipped classes, the officer would return the student to school and
have the option of issuing a citation.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials say how they deal with those students
will depend on the individual and the number of accumulated absences.</TE>
<TE>   If the student has an excessive number of absences, the youth
could be referred to a school attendance review board, a panel made
up of representatives from the school, social services agencies and
law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Because absences can go unnoticed for a long period, district
officials say, it takes an average of 20 absences before a student is
referred to the board.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that under the new ordinance they don't expect to pick
up any more truants, which average about 500 a year. The difference,
they say, is in how those students will be dealt with. The aim,
officials said, is to discourage students from skipping school again
after they've been caught the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Neal Andrews, who along with Councilman Carl Morehouse
voted against the ordinance, said the curfew is unnecessary, and very
likely will spur lawsuits against the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the risk of court challenge costs is unwarranted,"
Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   During the council's discussion, City Atty. Robert Boehm said
defending against a court challenge to the ordinance could cost the
city as much as $500,000. And if the ordinance is challenged under
the Civil Rights Act, which Boehm said would be a probable tack, the
losing side could have to pay the victor's court costs as well.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Smith, president of the Virginia-based Home School Legal
Defense Assn., which is now challenging the nation's first daytime
curfew in Monrovia, said his organization is watching Ventura and
scores of other California cities that have adopted curfews.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura officials maintain nighttime curfews have been upheld by
the courts, and that the city's ordinance is no different.</TE>
<TE>   "It's worth putting faith in the partnership between the school
district and the city and give this a try," Mayor Ray DiGuilio said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the new school year begins Aug. 28, the curfew will not
take effect until Sept. 5.</TE>

<HD>Annan Sets Conditions for Iraqi Arms Talks</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told Iraq on Tuesday that the
organization's chief weapons inspector could go to Baghdad for talks
only if discussions focused on practical arrangements for
inspections, which have been barred for nearly four years.</LD>
<LD>   Though Annan did not turn down Iraq's invitation for chief
inspector Hans Blix to visit, he listed U.N. Security Council
conditions for doing so in a letter to Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri, who last week invited Blix to Baghdad for technical talks.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is Iraq's insistence that the talks focus on a joint
evaluation of what remains to be done in investigating its nuclear,
chemical, biological and ballistic weapons programs.</LD>
<TE>   But a 1999 Security Council resolution says the inspectors cannot
determine unresolved tasks until they are back on the ground to see
what has happened since they left in December 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Annan said Blix had to be guided by council
resolutions.</TE>

<HD>Getting to Class Is a Test for West Bank Students</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRZEIT, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Islam Tawil sweated in the broiling afternoon sun, waiting for
permission to make his way to school.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli armored personnel carrier stood in his way, blocking
him and hundreds of other students trying to get to Birzeit
University, the oldest and most prestigious West Bank college. The
personnel carrier had roared into a spot next to the huge chunks of
cement that have made the road impassable for cars for months.</LD>
<LD>   Tawil, 26, of Ramallah, was carrying a large, boxy computer that
made the wait all the more tiring. But he needed it because it
contained his all-but-complete senior dissertation. He was staying
the night with a friend at Birzeit because he could not afford to
miss the deadline for turning it in the following day.</LD>
<TE>   Then, as quickly as they had arrived, the Israeli soldiers climbed
into their vehicle and sped off, the heat of the engine exhaust
raking across the students as they stood in a bedraggled line. In
seconds, Palestinians began scrambling over the cement barrier, many
of them late for class.</TE>
<TE>   "Our life is very bad," said Tawil, climbing into one of the taxis
waiting in a long row. "I should have graduated two months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Since Israel moved into Ramallah and other parts of the West Bank
this spring, throwing up checkpoints and roadblocks, Palestinian
student life has been in turmoil. The situation was exacerbated in
June, when the army reoccupied seven of eight major Palestinian
cities after back-to-back suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The closures and checkpoints not only have made life miserable,
they have fundamentally changed how hundreds of students and faculty
members manage their lives. At Bethlehem University, classes have met
catch-as-catch-can when curfews were lifted, extending the school
year to August when it should have ended in June. But that is better
than at An Najah University in Nablus, which had to shut down because
of extended curfews. There will be no graduation ceremonies at any
West Bank university this summer.</TE>
<TE>   At Birzeit, students fed up with long hours of waiting at
checkpoints have moved into any rooms they can find in the nearby
Palestinian village of Abu Qash. Others have moved into the few
available dormitory rooms. The alternative, they say, is to live a
life in which uncertainty and frustration are the norm and danger is
a real threat.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Aghazarian, a spokesman for the university, said there are
no official records on the number of students who have moved from
their homes in Jerusalem and Ramallah to finish the school year, but
he estimated it at 1,000, a fifth of the student body. "The logistics
have been a nightmare," Aghazarian said. "We're constantly trying to
improvise. You waste so much energy trying to catch up."</TE>
<TE>   A trip along the route most students normally take underscores the
difficulty they have faced, particularly in the last month of curfews
and road closures.</TE>
<TE>   There are two checkpoints in Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem,
where traffic can easily back up for hours as Israeli troops search
almost every car and truck for weapons or explosives that might be
used in an attack. After those checkpoints, students must drive or
take a taxi to a point where the road is barricaded and impassable by
car. Then they take a taxi on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that the school year, extended more than a month
because of the difficulties of getting to class, ends Aug. 15. The
hope is that when sessions resume in October, the "situation on the
ground," as circumstances here are often referred to, will have
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Humain, a third-year mechanical engineering student from
Ramallah, has rented a room in Abu Qash until the end of the school
year. The final straw was a missed test.</TE>
<TE>   "One day I had an exam at 11 in the morning," he said. "So I left
at 8. But they [Israelis] stopped me for three hours. Then they took
me to jail. They let me go, but by then I had missed the exam."</TE>
<TE>   Even women--who ordinarily would commute rather than leave the
family home--have relocated. Hiba Subluban, 21, took a room with four
other female students, paying $280 for the month so she doesn't have
to endure the checkpoints and searches.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't know when they are going to open or close the
checkpoints," she said, talking with friends in the school science
building. "I can't believe that in the last month of my senior year,
I had to move so that I could go to school."</TE>
<TE>   Rafeef Salamen, also a senior, used to drive each day from
Jerusalem. For a while, she tried to take back roads to avoid the
checkpoints, but that presented other problems. "It's dangerous
because of the settlers," she said, referring to Israelis living in
the West Bank who have become increasingly threatening to
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Instructors, too, have problems getting to school. Nashat Aqtash,
a journalism professor, shares an apartment with five other men and
makes the arduous 20-mile journey to his family in the village of
Beita no more than twice a month. Since June, Palestinians have not
been allowed to use the paved roads connecting the main population
centers in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Aqtash described the restrictions as "humiliating" and said it now
takes him four hours to reach his village. In better times, it was
half an hour.</TE>
<TE>   He said that a week earlier, he was stopped at an army checkpoint
while returning from his village. He said he and others were kept
standing in the sun for three hours before being released.</TE>
<TE>   The time was getting short. Only two hours remained before the 6
p.m. curfew--just barely enough time to get through the lines. Those
who hadn't found places to live nearby began streaming out of the
campus gates to begin, once again, their own battle with checkpoints.</TE>

for next week to avoid creating new misunderstandings with China, a
military spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a routine drill, but we were afraid that the public and
the media would read too much into it," the spokesman said on

<HD>11 Russian Troops Killed by Land Mine in Chechnya</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia</DL>
<LD>A radio-controlled land mine exploded Tuesday under a truck carrying
Chechen conscripts for the Russian army in southern Chechnya, killing
at least 11 soldiers and injuring 30, seven of them seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Rudnik Dudayev, secretary of Chechnya's Russian-appointed security
council in the Shatoi region, said rebels fighting for independence
for the republic were responsible for the attack, according to the
Interfax news agency.</LD>
<LD>   The attack came as the Russian army strengthened security around
the Chechen capital, Grozny, to block feared rebel attacks to mark
the sixth anniversary of their storming of the city.</LD>
<TE>   Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes, about 20 miles east of
Grozny, was closed except to cars having special military permits.</TE>
<TE>   At least 80 people had been picked up by Russian security forces
on suspicion of having rebel links since Monday, said a Chechen
civilian official who refused to allow use of his name.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel attack on Grozny on Aug. 6, 1996, caught Russian troops
by surprise. It led to a Russian retreat after a 20-month war, which
left Chechnya with de facto independence. Three years later, Russian
troops returned to Chechnya after rebel incursions into a neighboring
republic and apartment bombings blamed on the rebels in which 300
people were killed.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Wants Suit by Indonesians Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Justice: Government says permitting villagers to seek
damages from Exxon Mobil for rights abuses would harm American
interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The State Department has asked a federal court to dismiss a human
rights lawsuit by Indonesian villagers against Exxon Mobil, saying a
trial could harm U.S. economic and political interests in Asia,
including the struggle against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Villagers allege that Indonesian soldiers protecting an Exxon
plant in the strife-torn separatist province of Aceh tortured and
murdered innocent civilians. Exxon said it was not involved in any
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Human rights advocates said the U.S. government's request could
set a dangerous precedent. They said it would allow the war on
terrorism to be used to excuse human rights abuses and enable a
corporation to avoid being held accountable for labor violations
overseas.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a blatant misuse of the war on terrorism to suppress efforts
to promote human rights," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of
Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Both President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have
made a point of stressing--sometimes to the discomfort of foreign
leaders--that the war on terrorism should not be used to justify
suppression of legitimate dissent.</TE>
<TE>   But the Exxon Mobil case raises exactly the kind of sticky
political, economic and image problems that the Bush administration
faces as it pursues anti-terrorist alliances around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed by the International Labor Rights Fund, an
American nonprofit group, on behalf of 11 villagers in Aceh.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers allege that the Indonesian military units that
provide security for the plant that Exxon Mobil operates in a joint
venture with the Indonesian government committed rape, torture,
murder and kidnapping from 1999 to 2001, while the oil giant turned a
blind eye.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the security forces took villagers inside the Exxon
facility, where they were tortured, said Bama Athreya, deputy
director of the labor group.</TE>
<TE>   Athreya said some of the troops had been redeployed from East
Timor, where the Indonesian military is accused of having
orchestrated a bloody campaign against independence.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heard numerous complaints of a scorched earth campaign
they are carrying out" in Aceh, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil, Trisha Perkins, said that "the
allegations are without merit as far as our company is concerned" and
that the company "condemns human rights violations in any form,
anywhere in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that Exxon Mobil provided financial and
material support to the security forces and is thus liable for their
actions. The claim is based on two U.S. laws, the 1998 Torture
Victims Relief Act and the Alien Tort Act, a 1789 statute that has
been used by human rights lawyers for the last six years to allow
foreigners to sue for redress in U.S. federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   In May, U.S. District Judge Louis P. Oberdorfer in Washington
asked the State Department to comment on whether allowing the case to
go forward would harm U.S. interests. On July 29, State Department
legal advisor William H. Taft sent a six-page reply saying the U.S.
condemns human rights abuses by elements of the Indonesian army but
arguing that a trial could antagonize the world's most populous
Muslim nation, which is a focal point in the U.S. struggle against Al
Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The Indonesian government would probably resent the perceived
infringement on its sovereignty and curtail cooperation with the U.S.
on military, police and judicial reforms aimed at ending human rights
abuses, the government's brief said.</TE>
<TE>   The case might also discourage foreign investment, hinder
Indonesia's economic recovery and thus destabilize the country and
the region, the brief said. It also hinted that foreign competitors
might move in on the lucrative Indonesian oil and gas industry, with
even worse implications for local workers.</TE>
<TE>   But Athreya argued that the Indonesian government has bent over
backward to win foreign investment since the 1998 Asian financial
crisis and has been anxious to win resumption of U.S.-Indonesian
military ties.</TE>
<TE>   On his trip last week to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, Powell
said the U.S. would resume military-to-military exchanges with
Indonesia and promised roughly $50 million over several years to aid
security and counter-terrorism efforts. Powell also stressed the need
for Indonesia to implement economic and judicial reforms, fight
corruption and strengthen the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has long cited a national interest in promoting stability
in Indonesia, where the 32-year dictatorship of former President
Suharto ended only in 1998. On Tuesday, police in Jakarta used water
cannons to disperse about 7,000 students demanding direct
presidential elections and an end to the military's permanent right
to 38 seats in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how much influence the State Department's opinion
will have on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The International Labor Rights Fund has half a dozen other
lawsuits pending in which U.S. corporations are being sued by Third
World workers for alleged labor and rights violations, and it fears
that a dismissal of the Exxon case could set a precedent.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grave in Bosnia Held 200</HD>
<DH>Europe: Victims' bodies from the Srebrenica massacre were
in Muslim couple's yard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>Forensic experts in Bosnia said Tuesday that they have recovered the
remains of about 200 Muslims from a mass grave in a garden, bringing
to about 6,000  the number of exhumed victims of the 1995 Srebrenica
massacre.</LD>
<LD>   The Muslim-led Commission for Missing Persons has completed a
two-week exhumation at the site in the eastern village of Kamenica,
one of the larger mass graves containing Srebrenica victims,
commission president Amor Masovic said.</LD>
<LD>   The site came to light when a Muslim couple returning home after
Bosnia's 1992-95 war saw strange humps in their garden.</LD>
<TE>   Srebrenica, which was declared a U.N.-protected area, was overrun
in July 1995 by Bosnian Serb forces who killed as many as 8,000
Muslim men and boys.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his military
chief, Ratko Mladic, both still at large, have been indicted by a
U.N. war crimes tribunal for the massacre.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the site is a secondary mass grave, containing
bodies that had been buried elsewhere but were dug up, moved and
reburied, probably to avoid discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had found another mass grave in Kamenica, near the town
of Zvornik, and Masovic said a third has been identified in the
village.</TE>

<HD>Blair's Wife to Argue Gurkhas' Race Bias Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Members of the Nepalese regiment win the right to
sue the British government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain's feared Gurkha army units of Nepalese soldiers have won the
right to sue the British government for race discrimination and will
be represented in court by Cherie Booth, wife of Prime Minister Tony
Blair, a lawyer said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers, representing the Himalayan
troops who have fought for Britain since the 19th century, said they
had been given permission for their case to be heard.</LD>
<LD>   They allege that they are discriminated against in 24 ways, saying
their meager wages and pensions, set under a colonial-era 1947
agreement, do not provide them with the equivalent standard of living
when they retire in Nepal as that enjoyed by retired soldiers in
Britain.</LD>
<TE>   Shiner said not all the issues involved money. He said the Gurkhas
faced special dress code requirements, needed permission to leave
barracks and were obliged to attend Hindu religious services even
though many are Buddhist.</TE>
<TE>   A Defense Ministry spokeswoman said the military would "robustly
defend our position in court. The Gurkhas are treated well and will
continue to be."</TE>
<TE>   Matrix Chambers, the human rights legal practice where Cherie
Booth works, confirmed that she had taken the case.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, a pregnant Booth appeared in court to argue on behalf of
trade unions that the government needed to extend new parental leave
benefits retroactively, a case the government eventually settled.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the prime minister's office announced that Booth,
47, had recently suffered a miscarriage.</TE>

<DL>GUWAHATI, India</DL>
<LD>At least 200 people have died of encephalitis in the last two weeks
in India's northeastern Assam state, the state health minister said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Assam was hit by devastating floods in the middle of July, and
many parts of the state remain waterlogged, creating the breeding
conditions for the mosquitoes that spread the disease.</LD>
<LD>   More than 600 people suffering from the brain inflammation are
packed into hospitals throughout the state, Assam Health Minister
Bhumidhar Burman said.</LD>
<TE>   The floods, caused by overflowing rivers swollen by monsoon rains,
inundated more than half of Assam and displaced 10% of the state's 26
million people.</TE>
<TE>   Burman said the government has sent several tons of medicine and
vaccines to hospitals, as well as medical teams to reinforce rural
operations. UNICEF and the Red Cross also have sent medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The monsoon season normally runs from July to September. This
year's monsoon has been erratic, dropping little or no rain over vast
areas of India and triggering drought while causing horrific flooding
in the northeast.</TE>
<TE>   Since mid-July, floods, disease and landslides have caused nearly
850 deaths in Assam and the northeastern state of Bihar as well as in
Nepal and Bangladesh.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>REYKJAVIK, Iceland</DL>
<LD>Keiko the killer whale, star of the film "Free Willy," is adjusting
to life in the wild after years in captivity and is with a school of
killer whales off Iceland's southern coast, scientists said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are very excited and optimistic about Keiko's chances of
surviving in the wild," said Hallur Hallsson, spokesman for Ocean
Futures, which is monitoring Keiko's adaptation to the open seas.</LD>
<LD>   Keiko was captured near Iceland as a young calf and performed in
marine parks in Canada and Mexico for almost 20 years. He was
returned to Iceland in 1998 after people saw him as the captive whale
in the 1993 movie "Free Willy" and campaigned for him to go home.</LD>
<TE>   In early July, trainers escorted the 25-year-old whale to an open
ocean area inhabited by wild killer whales. Keiko stayed with the
whales for four days but then returned to the sea pen where he has
been fed and trained for four years.</TE>
<TE>   On July 17, the trainers took him back to the other whales, and
Keiko seems to have stayed with them since, Hallsson said.</TE>

<HD>Fox Will Head New Agency for Mexico Migrants</HD>
<DH>Latin American: The president replaces an office he closed
with one he says will be more responsive to the needs of citizens
abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox, answering criticism that he had tuned out the
voices of Mexican immigrants in the United States, announced the
creation of a Cabinet-level agency Tuesday to lobby for the interests
of Mexico's 22 million citizens abroad.</LD>
<LD>   Fox told 400 Mexican American leaders that he would head the new
National Council of Mexican Communities Abroad and soon appoint a
Mexican living outside the country to coordinate its advocacy and
assistance programs. The council will take advice from a panel of
other Mexican expatriates, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "The government ... will approach our compatriots with a
fraternal, agile hand," Fox declared at a decree-signing ceremony at
his Los Pinos residence. "I can assure all Mexican migrants that we
will not fail you!"</LD>
<TE>   Mexicans abroad heard a similar pledge when Fox took office in
December 2000, hailing them as "national heroes" and setting up a
presidential office to look after their needs.</TE>
<TE>   Its director, Juan Hernandez, shuttled between Mexico and the
U.S., lobbying to improve undocumented immigrants' access to
education and health care in America and to make it easier and
cheaper for them to wire money home.</TE>
<TE>   But last month, Fox abolished the office without comment after
Hernandez lost a power struggle with Foreign Minister Jorge
Castaneda. Castaneda and other Cabinet officials had complained that
the Texas-born literature professor announced new programs without
consulting the agencies charged with carrying them out.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican American groups reacted with unexpected fervor,
criticizing Fox for dumping a popular advocate without consulting
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Have we ceased to count?" asked leaders of two dozen such
organizations in a letter announcing a boycott of Tuesday's ceremony.
They said they feared that the new council, supplanting Hernandez's
office, would be more bureaucratic and less responsive.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Fox struck a defensive yet reassuring tone.
Mexico's 18 million immigrants in the U.S. send home an estimated $9
billion a year, the country's third-largest source of income after
oil and tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "Far from distancing ourselves from these concerns that we have
had since the presidential campaign, today we are confirming them,"
the president said. He applauded Hernandez's work but said it was
time for a more coordinated effort involving seven government
ministries.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials said Fox felt rushed to answer his critics
before starting to consult them over which groups will sit on the new
council's advisory panel.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who has not commented on his ouster, will apparently
play no role in the new setup. On Monday, he was offered the position
of coordinator of presidential records, with the task of setting up
an Internet site and writing reports on Fox's achievements.</TE>
<TE>   Fox promised to give "primordial importance" to the ideas of
Mexicans abroad, "leaving behind the idea" that government policies
toward expatriate citizens "are dictated unilaterally from Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   His audience's reaction was mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very strange," said Jose Jacques Medina, coordinator of
the Comite Pro-Union, a Mexican American group based in Maywood. "We
don't know how the Mexican American communities will fit in, how much
funding this council will get or where the money will come from.
We're a bit confused."</TE>
<TE>   The new council won tentative support from the Council of
Presidents of Mexican Federations in Los Angeles and the
Washington-based League of United Latin American Citizens. Brent
Wilkes, executive director of the latter group, said the change is
"probably better in the long run," since Hernandez's office lacked a
significant budget and staff.</TE>
<TE>   California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, in Mexico on state business,
said Castaneda invited him to Tuesday's ceremony with a day's notice.
Having heard criticism of Fox's initiative, Bustamante said he
hesitated, then decided to listen to the president.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to see the outcome of this new program," the
lieutenant governor said after Fox's speech. "Expectations have been
raised, and Fox understands that. That's why he put himself as the
presiding officer of the new council. There's a need to raise the
level of service to Mexicans abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Anthony McCarthy in Los Angeles contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect Killed in Israel</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Man was accused of organizing a bombing.
Meanwhile, negotiations continue.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops killed the suspected mastermind of a Tel Aviv suicide
bombing Tuesday, and Israel's interior minister threatened to revoke
the citizenship of Arabs involved in bombings or shooting attacks on
other Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Early today, at least 15 tanks and armored vehicles backed by
helicopters pressed into the northern Gaza Strip, firing shells and
machine guns at houses and searching for suspected militants,
Palestinian security officials and residents said. A 28-year-old
Palestinian died after being shot in the head, hospital officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The army said it was checking the report.</LD>
<TE>   The tanks remained about half a mile from the entrance to the
Jabaliya refugee camp, where a major incursion in March left at least
18 Palestinians dead. They began to withdraw about two hours after
entering.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had been bracing for an Israeli
response after a suicide bomber from the Islamic militant group Hamas
killed nine people on a bus in northern Israel on Sunday. Hamas uses
the Gaza Strip as a key base of operations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hard-line policies, Israelis and Palestinians appeared
to be trying to work out cease-fire proposals that could lead to
Israeli troops leaving some Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer met the Palestinian
interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh, late Monday, and more talks
were planned. Yehiyeh and other Palestinian officials were to leave
today for talks in Washington with Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Near the northern West Bank town of Jenin, Israeli forces killed
the suspected mastermind of a Tel Aviv suicide bombing and another
militiaman in a firefight, residents said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
linked to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement. One was Ali Ajouri, 23, accused by Israel of sending two
suicide bombers who blew themselves up in Tel Aviv on July 17. Three
foreign workers and two Israelis were killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said troops encountered the two wanted men in
Jabaa village and killed them in a chase.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's interior minister, Eli Yishai, from the ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party, threatened to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs
involved in carrying out attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   "If I stop one terrorist from killing one Jew, not to mention more
than that, it will be worthwhile," he told Israel's Army Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to stop suicide bombings continued. A 16-year-old
Palestinian girl was brought before an Israeli magistrate Tuesday in
Jerusalem on suspicion that she planned to carry out a suicide
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The girl shuffled into the courthouse, handcuffed and shackled.
Her lawyer denied police claims that she had confessed to planning an
attack.</TE>

<HD>Allies Cool to Striking Baghdad</HD>
<DH>Policy: Any U.S. military action against Iraq should first
be approved by the U.N., some say. Popular opposition to an attack is
growing in Europe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>As the U.S. saber rattles in the direction of Iraq, European allies
are making their own noise in opposition to war and are insisting
that any military action against Baghdad be endorsed first by the
United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   A day after German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder put Washington on
notice that his country's solidarity in the war against terrorism
won't extend to "adventures," Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called
Tuesday for "different priorities" to replace invasion in the global
search for security and peace.</LD>
<LD>   The German leadership's push for a more pacifist approach to
ensuring that Iraq cannot make or use weapons of mass destruction
could be seen as political posturing, as Schroeder this week put his
troubled campaign for reelection into full throttle.</LD>
<TE>   But in Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair has already hinted
that he will support whatever action against Iraq is deemed necessary
by U.S. allies, an influential phalanx of religious leaders and
laymen is urging Blair to oppose military intervention.</TE>
<TE>   "It is our considered view that an attack on Iraq would be both
immoral and illegal, and that eradicating the dangers posed by
malevolent dictators and terrorists can be achieved only by tackling
the root causes of the disputes themselves," a group of clergy said
in a declaration delivered to Blair's 10 Downing Street office
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal from the Christian peace movement Pax Christi was
signed by nearly 3,000 people across the religious spectrum,
including the new head of the Anglican Church and archbishop of
Canterbury, Rowan Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "It is deplorable that the world's most powerful nations continue
to regard war and the threat of war as an acceptable instrument of
foreign policy, in violation of the ethos of both the United Nations
and Christian moral teachings," the document said.</TE>
<TE>   Other European politicians and social groups have also been
grumbling loudly that the White House may move to depose Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein without support or authorization from the
U.N. Security Council. President Bush has stepped up his rhetoric
calling for a "regime change" in Baghdad in recent weeks, and
Congress last week opened hearings on the rationale and risks of an
Iraq invasion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a senior White House official said the administration
believes that one of the Sept. 11 hijackers had ties to Iraq, despite
CIA and FBI doubts about any such link.</TE>
<TE>   Proof of such a tie would bolster the case against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac said during a visit to Germany
last week that he could back a strike on Iraq only if it had advance
Security Council approval. Though U.S. and British officials
dismissed as a stalling technique Baghdad's recent proposal for U.N.
arms inspector Hans Blix to visit for talks, France has urged the
United Nations to pursue the offer in the hopes that it can help get
U.N. teams back into Iraq to ensure that Hussein is no longer
producing nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to imagine an attack against Iraq, an attack that
could not be justified unless it is decided by the Security Council,"
Chirac said after meeting with Schroeder. "That is the position of
Germany; that is the position of France."</TE>
<TE>   French foreign policy and public opinion often clash with those of
the United States on fundamental issues such as the Middle East, the
death penalty and global warming. Especially on the left of the
political spectrum, the prospect of a U.S. war on Iraq draws vigorous
resistance in France.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Italian Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, both conservatives, have been silent on the Iraqi
face-off for the moment, perhaps mindful of the powerful pacifist
movements within their predominantly Roman Catholic electorates.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi neighbors Jordan and Turkey are warning about potential
threats to Middle East stability if Baghdad is attacked. Jordanian
Prime Minister Ali abu Ragheb told visiting Turkish Foreign Minister
Sukru Sina Gurel on Tuesday that such an assault would have
"disastrous economic and human consequences" for the entire region.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly agree with the Jordanian position and share the same
concerns. We feel every problem in the region should be settled
through peaceful means," said Gurel, whose country is a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is seeking to join the
European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations about U.S. policy on Iraq have become particularly
serious among Germans and Britons, with popular sentiment in both
countries measurably opposed to any further military commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Since World War II left their country a pariah in economic
shambles, Germans have regarded foreign interventions with
trepidation. The Social Democrats, led by Schroeder, and their
allies, the pacifist, environmentalist Greens, are trailing
conservative challengers on economic issues. But the chancellor's bow
to voters' desire for "a special German way" in fulfilling NATO
obligations is striking a chord with a population largely fearful of
the economic and moral costs of another war.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that different priorities are needed here, like solving
regional conflicts and the fight against terrorism," Fischer, a
Greens member, told journalists as he began a 45-day campaign swing
through 90 German towns. "For me, a European position is of central
significance."</TE>
<TE>   At a weekend rally in his hometown of Hanover, Schroeder said: "I
can only warn against discussing a war in Iraq without thinking about
the consequences and without having a political concept for the whole
Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   In their issues published Monday, the major German newsmagazines
Der Spiegel and Focus both cast Bush's stance on Iraq as a vendetta
against Hussein, whom Bush's father failed to depose during the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, lawmakers from Blair's Labor Party have been urging
the prime minister to recall Parliament from its summer recess to
debate the wisdom of military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   From a hotel in Baghdad, Labor legislator and anti-war activist
George Galloway told reporters Tuesday that he planned to talk with
Iraqi leaders and meet peace campaigners.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Pax Christi petition was symptomatic of "an anxiety
bordering on panic around the world over the fact that we may be
sleepwalking into a catastrophic situation."</TE>
<TE>   The British public has been sounded out too. Polls commissioned by
independent Channel 4 News on Monday showed that 52% oppose British
military cooperation with the U.S. over Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   NATO defense ministers are to meet next month amid several
European election campaigns, pushing the Iraq issue onto political
agendas in member countries. That may highlight disagreements among
the allies, not only over a potential strike against Baghdad but also
over continued participation in peacekeeping and anti-terror
deployments such as those in the Balkans and Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>Toppled From Their Pedestal</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Greeks find that a violent group they sometimes
saw as heroic was all too human.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATHENS</DL>
<LD>When a military dictatorship ruled Greece three decades ago, secret
police informers were everywhere. So ever since that hated junta
fell, snitching has been more despised here than in most societies.</LD>
<LD>   Small wonder, then, that members of the once-romanticized November
17 terrorist organization have fallen from their dubious pedestal
since their recent arrests. The men's involvement in terrorist acts
isn't the main issue--it's their collective case of what one defense
attorney called "verbal diarrhea."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, members of the terrorist gang seem almost to be competing
with one another to show who can cooperate most fully with
authorities.</LD>
<TE>   The notorious November 17, blamed for 23 killings and many
robberies over the last quarter-century, was often portrayed as an
almost invincible band of ideologically hardened Marxist
revolutionaries. For many Greeks, the most stunning revelation of the
confessions is how the men have come across as intellectually
unsophisticated working stiffs who were simply doing their
jobs--sometimes without even knowing whom they would be killing.</TE>
<TE>   A simplistic anti-imperialist and anti-American ideology appears
to have played a role in drawing most of them into the group. But
their confessions give the impression that they stayed for more basic
reasons: a lust for thrills and the feeling of self-importance, ties
of kinship and friendship, the income from bank robberies and the
fear that they would be killed if they tried to get out.</TE>
<TE>   Named after the date in 1973 when the junta crushed a student
uprising, November 17 burst into prominence with its first slaying,
that of CIA Athens station chief Richard Welch in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   During the group's early years, a significant portion of the Greek
public--angered by U.S. support for the 1967-74
dictatorship--appeared sympathetic to its ideology if not its
methods.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mid-1980s, when the group targeted prominent Greek
businessmen, public opinion began to swing more solidly against it.
In the last two years, with the Greek government under pressure to
prove capable of running a safe Olympics in 2004, investigative work
aimed at the group was stepped up. Police also accepted help from
Scotland Yard and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   A Fortuitous Capture</TE>
<TE>   Then, in late June, suspected November 17 member Savas Xiros, 40,
was injured allegedly when a bomb he was carrying went off
prematurely. His capture led police to safe houses and the arrest of
more than a dozen other suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandros Giotopoulos, 58, the accused leader of the group, said
in court that his co-defendants' confessions were lies designed to
frame him and win themselves lighter punishment. Under a new
anti-terrorism law, confessions can win the men leniency. And because
Greece has no death penalty, they needn't fear execution even if they
confess to multiple murders.</TE>
<TE>   But few others question that the suspects' stories contain much
that is true--whatever else may be missing or distorted.</TE>
<TE>   Police say that Christodoulos Xiros, 44, one of those who has
talked the most, has confessed to involvement in nine murders, five
murder attempts, 11 bomb and rocket attacks and a string of bank
robberies over nearly 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement leaked to the press, he coldly described the June
28, 1988, assassination of a U.S. Embassy defense attache, Navy Capt.
William Nordeen.</TE>
<TE>   Explosives were packed into a car along a route often taken by "an
American official," with a triggering device placed in a nearby empty
house, Xiros said.</TE>
<TE>   "When the target passed in his car, I pressed the button on the
remote control," he said. "Only on the news after the act did we
learn that the target was killed and that it was U.S. Capt. Nordeen."</TE>
<TE>   Dora Bakoyannis, the widow of Pavlos Bakoyannis, a conservative
member of Parliament killed by the gang in 1989, said in a recent
interview that "terrorism is so difficult to deal with because
they're killing people without knowing them, without any feelings
against them."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult time for the families of the victims, for
many reasons," said Bakoyannis, an opposition member of Parliament
and candidate for mayor of Athens in elections scheduled for this
year. "They see the whole scene every day on television, again and
again. And they are looking at persons, trying to understand how and
why these persons killed our loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   Police are trying to determine whether a letter claiming to be
from November 17 that was published last Wednesday is genuine or not.</TE>
<TE>   Eleftherotypia, a leading Greek daily, reported that it had seen
the letter, which bore November 17's trademark red star and
threatened kidnappings as a response to the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Based on what is known so far of November 17, the group looks more
like a mutation of a traditional Greek small business, built on ties
of family and friendship, than an ideologically committed
revolutionary band--the image it cultivated in statements distributed
after its killings. Three of those arrested are brothers, several
others are more distantly related, and most of the rest were their
close friends.</TE>
<TE>   "From their testimony, it appears that November 17's members were
like people who find a job in a company and do what is asked of them,
without having any great responsibility for its strategy, budget,
corporate image and bottom line," commentator Nikos Konstandaras
wrote in Kathimerini, a leading Greek daily.</TE>
<TE>   Giotopoulos, the alleged leader, can be viewed as the CEO of a
small firm making decisions with a few other board members,
Konstandaras said.</TE>
<TE>   Giotopoulos is the son of a prominent Greek follower of the
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky who reportedly switched sides to
support Greece's right-wing government after World War II. When he
learned how his father was loathed by his former comrades,
Giotopoulos apparently became determined not to repeat the elder
man's abandonment of the leftist cause.</TE>
<TE>   'Obviously Not Content'</TE>
<TE>   "The members of the board were obviously not content with running
a lucrative business, using their personnel and know-how to rob banks
and armored trucks," Konstandaras wrote, " ... but had delusions of
grandeur as well, using the blood of their victims as a peg for their
dilettante leader's incoherent 'anti-imperialist' rambling."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to police, Vassilis Xiros, 30, one of three
brothers in the gang, described the May 28, 1997, slaying of Greek
shipowner Constantinos Peratikos--and how a stupid mistake nearly led
to the killers' capture.</TE>
<TE>   "During one meeting, 'Loukas' and my brother [Savas Xiros] told me
that our next plan was to kill the shipowner Peratikos," he said in
his statement, using the code name of a man who has been identified
as fugitive Dimitris Koufodinas. "The reason, they told me, was that
he had laid off many employees without any regard for the families
that would be made penniless."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the slaying, a fourth man, code-named "Takis," drove
the three to a place where they expected Peratikos to come by,
Vassilis Xiros said. Then the driver got out and left, and "Loukas"
and Savas Xiros watched for their prey, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When they saw Peratikos approach, they got out and walked toward
him," Vassilis Xiros said. "I sat in the driver's seat, as I had been
told to do. While sitting there, I heard gunfire.... Immediately
after the shooting, 'Loukas' and Savas returned to the van. I tried
to start the van, but it was impossible. 'Takis' had left something
on, and the car battery had given out."</TE>
<TE>   They had to hoof it. When someone, probably a policeman, opened
fire on them, they raced down the road and commandeered a taxi.</TE>
<TE>   "I fired two shots into the air to frighten the crowd that was
beginning to gather and to make sure nobody would follow us," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   They drove to an alley, switched vehicles and soon abandoned the
second car, he said. They had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Vassilis Tzortzatos, 48, projected enormous nonchalance in his
description of how he came to participate in the Feb. 21, 1985,
killing of newspaper publisher Nikos Momferratos.</TE>
<TE>   "I met Christodoulos Xiros through a friend of mine," Tzortzatos
said in his statement to police. "We started hanging out together,
and after a while, early in 1985, he asked if I would be interested
in doing something with him. I asked him what exactly we would be
doing. He said something about bombs and that kind of stuff. I asked
if we would be the ones doing this--we, the inept? And that was the
end of the conversation.</TE>
<TE>   "But Christodoulos, a few days later, told me straight out that I
should join the November 17 organization. I agreed and joined."</TE>
<TE>   Tzortzatos soon took part in discussions "about economic targets
and American political targets which we would have to take some
action against in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These meetings were repeated many times until one day we decided
to kill Momferratos, the publisher of the newspaper Apogevmatini....
We had decided to murder Momferratos for his yellow journalism and
his representation of the upper class."</TE>
<TE>   Tzortzatos said his role in the assassination was to watch for
Momferratos to pass by in his car.</TE>
<TE>   "When Momferratos' car passed by and I was sure he was in it, I
raised my hand, and a little while later I heard gunshots," he said.
"After the gunshots, I left and went home."</TE>
<TE>   Tzortzatos said he learned on television that Momferratos had been
killed. He met the next day in a city park with two of his partners
in the crime and discussed the killing, he said. "We were all
satisfied with the outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two years, the publisher's son, George Momferratos,
has helped organize a group of victims' relatives who have spoken out
in an effort to turn public opinion more solidly against the group.</TE>
<TE>   There had been a degree of sympathy for November 17 because "you
have all these left activists who went through a lot of problems in
the past," he said, so "the reflex toward terrorism was, 'Don't touch
the terrorists, they're fighters for human rights.' Very stupid.</TE>
<TE>   "Now things are changing," he said, adding that he believes "there
are still strong elements of quasi-support" for November 17 within
the Greek public.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think Greece has confronted this issue," he said, "and
it has to be confronted."</TE>

<HD>3 Suspects in School Attack Die in Blast</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JHIKA GALI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Three of the men suspected of attacking a Christian school in
Pakistan this week, killing six people, blew themselves up Tuesday
after they were challenged by police, said Tahir Quyoom, deputy
inspector general of police in the northern city of Muzaffarabad. All
three are believed to be dead, Quyoom said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials and diplomats said they believed that Monday's attack on
Murree Christian School--attended by 146 children of foreign
missionaries working in Muslim Pakistan and neighboring
countries--was a strike against Western interests rather than a
religiously motivated attack.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest in a series of assaults targeting Christian
institutions or foreigners in Pakistan since the military government
of President Pervez Musharraf incensed militant Muslim groups by
siding with the U.S.-led war on terrorism after Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   At least four young men armed with assault rifles entered the
school compound in Jhika Gali, 25 miles northeast of Islamabad, the
capital, and opened fire, killing six Pakistanis, including two
security guards and a retired teacher, police said. None of the
students or the foreign staff of 30 to 35 were hurt. The attackers
escaped after a 20-minute battle with guards.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when police officers at a checkpoint saw three men approach
in the nearby village of Khabadar, they searched one and found a
grenade. Quyoom said the men were free after they threatened to blow
up themselves and the officers. The men walked to a nearby river and
a blast was heard, which Quyoom believed killed all three, he added.</TE>
<TE>   One body was recovered from the river, and authorities were
searching for the other two.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Disavows Report on Saudis</HD>
<DH>Policy: Officials move to ease strain from Pentagon
briefing that was critical of Arab ally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration distanced itself Tuesday from a Pentagon
briefing that described Saudi Arabia as an adversary of the United
States and a backer of terrorism, with Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld saying the briefing doesn't represent the views of the U.S.
government and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell repeating that
message in a call to the Saudi foreign minister.</LD>
<LD>   The White House also distanced itself from the comments, and in
Jidda, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal denounced the
briefing as "pure fiction."</LD>
<LD>   The briefing to the Defense Policy Board, a Pentagon advisory
panel made up of former senior officials and retired top military
officers, recommended that U.S. officials demand that Saudi Arabia
stop supporting terrorism or face retaliation.</LD>
<TE>   "The Saudis are active at every level of the terror chain,"
asserted the briefing, which was delivered July 10 by Laurent
Murawiec, a Rand Corp. international security analyst. It also said,
"Saudi Arabia supports our enemies and attacks our allies."</TE>
<TE>   The briefing recommended that the United States target Saudi oil
fields and financial assets if the Mideast nation didn't take certain
actions against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate that there are people in some quarters who are
trying to cast doubt and undermine the solid and historic ties
between our two countries," Saud said in a statement. "I am confident
that they will not succeed."</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi Arabia is a long-standing friend and a long-standing ally,"
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. "We very much appreciate
the way they are cooperating in the global war against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld did acknowledge differences with the Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nonetheless a country where we have a lot of forces located
and we have a had a long relationship, and yet ... a number of the
people who were involved [in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks] happen
to have been Saudi individuals," Rumsfeld told Pentagon employees.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. lawmakers are among those who have complained that Saudi
Arabia hasn't done enough to rein in support for the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, discourage suicide bombings by Palestinians or
support U.S. military operations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Saudis say the U.S. does not do enough to pressure Israel to
alleviate the suffering of Palestinians.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The 8-month-old hunt for Mullah Mohammed Omar hit close to home
Tuesday with the reported capture of a brother-in-law of the fugitive
Taliban leader.</LD>
<LD>   Others with the captured man fled into the Afghan mountains, the
local governor said, but it was not known whether Omar was believed
to be among them.</LD>
<LD>   The man, named Noorullah, brother of one of Omar's three wives,
was arrested Sunday in the central province of Oruzgan, provincial
Gov. Jan Mohammed Khan said.</LD>
<TE>   Noorullah had been "trying to carry out sabotage," the governor
said. He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people and the Americans went into the mountains to search
for his friends who fled," the governor said.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say where the arrest took place or where the hunt
was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to talk about that because our men are up there in
the mountains right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Small teams of U.S. special operations troops and allied Afghan
forces have been searching for Omar for months in Oruzgan, his home
province, among high peaks and near-impassable roads.</TE>
<TE>   Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban's 1996-2001 regime, has
been sought since fleeing Kandahar in December.</TE>

<HD>Imprisoned Mexican Faces a Second Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of the former
president, is accused of channeling government funds to private bank
accounts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOLUCA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Raul Salinas de Gortari, imprisoned brother of a former Mexican
president, was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on new charges that he
channeled government funds into private Swiss bank accounts.</LD>
<LD>   A judge in this city 35 miles west of Mexico City ruled that there
was enough evidence to try Salinas on charges of receiving about $21
million in 1993 from a secret fund for his brother, who was president
from 1988 to 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Salinas is already serving a sentence of nearly 27 years for
masterminding the 1994 murder of his former brother-in-law, who was
secretary-general of Mexico's then- ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party.</LD>
<TE>   Salinas' lawyers said they planned to appeal the judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Salinas has long insisted that about $130 million found in his
Swiss and British bank accounts in 1995 came from Mexican businessmen
who had entrusted him with an investment fund.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss officials have argued that the money came from drug
traffickers, while Mexican prosecutors said it probably came from
political corruption.</TE>
<TE>   According to the new allegations, money was diverted to Salinas
out of a "secret fund" traditionally available to Mexican presidents,
who did not need to account for it.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has not been charged
with wrongdoing in either case involving his brother.</TE>

<HD>A Rough Road Awaits in Colombia</HD>
<DH>South America: Amid the country's worsening internal
conflict, the president-elect vows to act within hours of taking
office today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>When Alvaro Uribe takes over as Colombia's president today, 200,000
troops will be patrolling the nation's streets. A U.S. spy plane will
be circling overhead. And the oath of office will be administered
behind closed doors.</LD>
<LD>   This is the type of place Colombia has become. Even an act so
important to a nation's civic life as the president's inauguration
cannot take place in public for fear of violence.</LD>
<LD>   More than ever, Colombia is a nation at war. The country's
internal conflict has sputtered along for nearly 40 years.</LD>
<TE>   But as the U.S. continues to provide money, equipment and
intelligence to Colombia's government, the fighting threatens to
engulf the country as never before.</TE>
<TE>   The escalating conflict comes as Colombia's economy is threatened
by the shaky finances of Latin American giants Argentina and Brazil,
and as Colombia's Congress is under attack for rampant corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, in short, needs to turn around the country's military,
political and financial structure. And he has to do it as the nation
crumbles around him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a high-wire exercise, but it has to be done," Vice
President-elect Francisco Santos said in an interview Tuesday, just
24 hours before his swearing-in.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no miracles," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Santos said Uribe is committed to showing results as soon as
possible. Uribe, a former state governor, has promised that within
hours of taking office today, he will introduce a packet of political
reforms to create a unicameral Congress, cut government pensions and
increase executive power.</TE>
<TE>   "Timing is crucial to get all the reforms in the first year," said
Santos, who was kidnapped by drug lord Pablo Escobar's henchmen in
1990. "We know people will be disappointed if in one year, a year and
a half, two years, they don't see results."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many wonder whether Uribe plans to fight too many battles
at once. Total support for the war effort will be a monumental task
in a nation that has traditionally resisted all-out conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "The most difficult problem for Uribe is to convince the country
to pay the price for the war," said Andres Jimenez, a journalist and
political analyst. "Colombians are like people at a pole-climbing
competition. They cheer the guy on the way up, but when he gets close
to the top, they start throwing stones to knock him off."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe was elected in May with 53% of the vote, the first time
since the country's latest constitution was approved in 1991 that any
candidate won in a first round of voting.</TE>
<TE>   His victory was based largely on a promise to crack down on the
guerrilla groups, especially the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, which has about 17,000 troops.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, Uribe must find a way to protect the thousands
of people killed, kidnapped or maimed each year by guerrillas--as
well as by Colombia's growing right-wing paramilitary groups. And he
has to do it fast.</TE>
<TE>   "The honeymoon is not going to last long," said Daniel Garcia
Pena, a former peace negotiator. "The question is how much [time] can
he buy with the political capital he has."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe has proposed doubling the size of the police and armed
forces to about 400,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants to create a million-member citizens watch brigade to
serve as military informants. And he wants to do away with the draft,
increasing the number of professional soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Though these measures would go far in building on recent
improvements to Colombia's military achieved under outgoing President
Andres Pastrana, there are political and financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   First, such measures will take time--at least several years to
field a fully trained new force of soldiers, according to military
experts.</TE>
<TE>   Second, they'll take money, and Colombia is in desperately short
supply. Uribe has said his proposals will cost $1 billion--about
equal to 1% of the country's gross domestic product. Unemployment
remains high at 17%. Foreign capital and investment continue to flee.</TE>
<TE>   To pay the bill, Uribe is set to propose a series of tax and
financial reforms.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal is for a flat sales tax of 15% on most goods and the
closure of numerous tax loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   He also has suggested war bonds and a restructuring of the
country's lending deals with the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Santos said reforms and the crackdown on tax evaders could raise
as much as $7 billion. Even then, he said, the country will still
need support from the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has supplied nearly $2 billion in training, military
equipment and drug-eradication programs to Colombia in the last two
years. But it has repeatedly vowed not to send ground troops.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably need a lot more training," Santos said. "We'll
probably need a lot more mobility. We'll probably need a lot more
sophisticated weapons. And we'll probably need more intelligence and
communications. We'll fight this war. We're going to do our job. But
we need help."</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's most audacious reform proposal may be the political
referendum he has promised to introduce today.</TE>
<TE>   If approved--first by Congress and then by voters--it would allow
Uribe to seize control of many budget functions, ostensibly to
prevent pork-barrel spending. Most striking, it would allow him to
put a vote directly to the people to dissolve Congress and hold
elections.</TE>
<TE>   The referendum, in effect, would greatly weaken the powers of the
legislature. Its prospects remain unclear, even though Uribe
supporters control both houses of Congress and have promised to pass
the bill.</TE>

<HD>Broadcasters of Hearn's Stature Mean More Than Words Can
Describe</HD>
<DH>Media: The era when fans could identify a voice with a team
is coming to an end.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the fan with an ear to a radio, Chick Hearn was the broadcaster
who talked about players "yo-yoing" up and down the court or being
faked "into the popcorn machine."</LD>
<LD>   But to the Los Angeles Lakers, he was an asset of incalculable
value, one that team owner Jerry Buss called "as responsible for this
success as any of the great players who have worn a Laker uniform."</LD>
<LD>   Replacing Hearn will be challenge enough--after all, many say he
and his "Chickisms" are simply irreplaceable. But finding a successor
for Hearn, who died Monday at 85, will be all the more difficult at a
time when sports proliferates on television and radio, often
moderated by scores of seemingly interchangeable announcers.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of broadcasters now sound alike," bemoans broadcaster Joe
Buck, son of the revered Jack Buck, who died this year after
broadcasting St. Louis Cardinals games since 1954. "Guys change
blazers and put on a different patch on their chest. The guy at CBS
is now at NBC, and the guy at NBC is now at Fox."</TE>
<TE>   The era of the venerable announcer who shuns retirement and is
joined at the hip with a single franchise--people such as Hearn, Jack
Buck, the L.A. Dodgers' Vin Scully or Ernie Harwell of the Detroit
Tigers--is quickly ending.</TE>
<TE>   There's no blueprint to replace a legend, which is why teams wary
of fan wrath tread carefully.</TE>
<TE>   When beloved Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray died in 1998 at
77, the broadcasting torch was passed to another generation when his
grandson Chip was named the team's TV announcer. Joe Buck, a national
broadcaster for the Fox network, filled in while his father was ill;
Jack Buck died in June at 77.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers learned how hard it is to replace a venerable
play-by-play man when the team fired Harwell in 1991, causing
citywide backlash and T-shirts reading "Bring Back Ernie" sold across
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   When Mike Ilitch, who built the Little Caesar's pizza chain,
bought the team the next year, he made rehiring Harwell his first
priority.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys like us, we're like an old shoe. When someone else comes in
to replace us, it doesn't quite fit," said Harwell, 84, who is
retiring at the end of this season after 42 years with the Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Harwell, who began his career in 1948, says today's broadcasters
are as good as their predecessors but that "it's harder now to make
an impact."</TE>
<TE>   "When I started, there were eight teams in each league and one guy
announcing," he said. "Now there are 30 teams and six announcers per
team and guys on ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   Sports marketing and radio consultant Walter Sabo doubts that
anyone has ever put a dollar value on these announcers, and he says
he has never seen a study on it. But in market research, he says,
play-by-play announcers always score among the highest in popularity
among listeners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true of all enduring talk radio hosts or announcers," Sabo
said. "As soon as there's a shift, a change, and someone leaves, it's
always a disaster. It's because of the way that people bond with the
radio. That speaks to the power and intimacy of the medium."</TE>
<TE>   Smith College sports economist Andrew Zimbalist says the
broadcaster's obvious appeal is to help boost radio and television
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "But sportscasters have a value beyond just the ratings points,"
he said, "because they also perform public relations functions like
going into schools around a city and getting kids interested in the
sport. Their value goes above and beyond what can be measured in
ratings."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, fans have long treated Hearn, Scully and 29-year
Kings hockey broadcaster Bob Miller with reverence.</TE>
<TE>   This year, fans were asked to name their favorite all-time Dodger
on the team's Web site in conjunction with Dodger Stadium's 40th
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Prevailing over players such as Sandy Koufax, Fernando Valenzuela
and Steve Garvey and Manager Tom Lasorda was Scully, 74, who never
played a game but whose golden throat has been the "voice of the
Dodgers" all 44 years the team has been in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But today's announcers are likely to seek a national stage.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find a better example of past and future than the
late Jack Buck and his 33-year-old son Joe. The younger broadcaster
has a higher profile on the national stage than his father did. Joe
Buck broadcasts nationally televised baseball games for Fox and is
scheduled to start working National Football League games in the fall
for the network.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is such that a lot of people in my generation of
broadcasting now don't want to stick it out for 40 years," Buck said.
"My father sat in the booth when Stan Musial hit five home runs in a
double header, and he was there when Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home
run."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland, who filled in for Hearn after his heart surgery
and broken hip last season, is considered a front-runner for the
Lakers' TV play-by-play position.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Meyers, who lives in Southern California and has been
announcing for the San Antonio Spurs in recent years, also has been
mentioned as a candidate for one of the play-by-play positions.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, who broadcast 3,338 consecutive games in a streak from 1965
until last December, did play-by-play on both television and radio.
With Hearn gone, the team plans to split those duties.</TE>
<TE>   With competition so intense, doing good play-by-play also often
leads to quickly being courted for national sports jobs providing
more money, recognition and opportunities ranging from movie cameos
to talk show host.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not what fans of broadcasters like Hearn and Buck are
looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, radio station KMOX, which carries the Cardinal games,
placed a tall order: a want ad on its Web site advertising for "a
sports ambassador" post once held by Buck.</TE>
<TE>   It read: "You are big in your community. People come to hear you
speak. You are recognized by people on the street. You love to make
people laugh and you can move them with your stories. You have
friends in prominent positions in the sports community and the
community in general. They socialize with you and you can talk with
them and have fun with them on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't consider yourself a sports journalist, but a
broadcaster, toastmaster and celebrity. You are respected by owners,
players and management. You are happy where you are. But this is the
opportunity of a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Larry Stewart and library researcher John
Jackson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Facing a Real Emergency</HD>
<DH>Harbor-UCLA Medical Center is one of two facilities the
county is threatening to close. For many people, the effects would be
profound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the windowless emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, there
is one way to tell the sun is rising. Doctors pick up their already
frenetic pace as the sick, slouched in plastic chairs, nervously
watch the clock.</LD>
<LD>   Patients like Jessica Short have to get to work.</LD>
<LD>   Short, 19, has no insurance and cannot afford to miss a single
shift as an usher at the local multiplex. A doctor at a county clinic
had told her she needed surgery to stop some bleeding. The only place
she could find a surgeon in the middle of the night was Harbor, where
doctors cater to the ills of the working poor between treating
gunshot wounds and heart attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Short got to the emergency room after her shift ended at 6:30
p.m., hoping to be in and out of surgery in time for her 11:30 a.m.
shift the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "People come to this ER every night after they put the children to
bed and before the next morning's shift," said Dr. Sam Stratton.
"There's no other way possible for them."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Torrance-area hospital has provided patients with
almost any type of medical care they needed, at any hour and for a
nominal fee. Staff members say a low-income person like Short--who
lives with her parents on a combined income of $35,000--pays a
maximum $202 for any outpatient service. But that may soon be a thing
of the past. Harbor is one of two large public hospitals that the
county has threatened to shut down, piece by piece, starting in
October, to solve a budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   If no new money is found, departments would close as the cash
dries up. First would be the psychiatric emergency room. Then the
general emergency room. Then the surgical wards. Then support for the
research labs that developed such commonly used medical procedures as
the blood test for cholesterol. Then the intensive-care units that
treat the sickest of the sick. Finally, the hospital would be
converted to an outpatient clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes would directly affect a vast area of southwestern
Los Angeles County, home to more than 2 million people. Even the
cost-cutters admit it would leave a gaping hole in a regional medical
system that serves an area including the gritty Long Beach wharves,
the frenzied San Diego and Harbor freeways and the southern half of
Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   During the last county funding crisis, in 1995, Harbor appeared on
a list of hospitals slated to close. A $1-billion federal bailout
kept it open.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors now find themselves in the midst of
another budget crisis--with Harbor once again on the chopping
block--because they have resisted pressure to reduce the services it
offers to the poor and uninsured and have counted on aid from
Washington to cover the funding gaps.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration, grappling with its own deficits, is
not believed to be as eager to assist Los Angeles County as the
Clinton administration, which authorized the last bailout. That
leaves the network of county hospitals and clinics with a deficit
expected to reach $800 million by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, supervisors are showing a new willingness to make
tough changes. In June, they voted to close 11 clinics and cut $150
million from the health department. They will ask voters this fall to
approve a $168-million tax to preserve trauma and emergency care at
Harbor and other hospitals, though they acknowledge it will be tough
to get the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the tax.</TE>
<TE>   Health planners say that, if the tax does not pass, in the worst
case, all inpatient care would be centralized at the largest public
hospital, County-USC Medical Center in Boyle Heights. King-Drew
Medical Center in Watts--the county's second-busiest trauma
center--would be the only other hospital to survive, and even it
would undergo cutbacks. Harbor and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in
Sylmar would become clinics.</TE>
<TE>   The health department is to decide by October how much of Harbor
it will recommend that supervisors close. Department planners say it
is a foregone conclusion that Harbor's psychiatric emergency room
will be shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   It is not quite a room, actually, but an eerily vacant, pale
hallway lined with locked treatment cubicles, where video cameras
monitor patients at all times. Last year the department logged 6,214
patient visits. Most are brought in against their will by police or
family members.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those treated in the psychiatric emergency room also have
life-threatening physical ailments. A stroke victim can suffer from
dementia; a schizophrenic might arrive with slashed wrists.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's very easy to close just one part of the
emergency room," said Dr. Roderick Shaner, medical director of the
Department of Mental Health. "People will come anyway."</TE>
<TE>   They will end up in the next department slated for
closing--emergency medicine, which runs the hospital's general ER.</TE>
<TE>   The ER is so flooded with patients that they back up into a
cavernous waiting room off a hallway. Some patients there, like
Jessica Short, the movie usher who needs surgery, require high-end
treatment elsewhere in the hospital. Others, like 7-month-old Ariel
Whitmer, just need a doctor to treat their fever.</TE>
<TE>   "They treat her good here," said her mother, Stacy Whitmer, one of
many who make repeated visits to the emergency room. "They're the
only ones that take the time to look at her and tell me what's wrong
with her."</TE>
<TE>   The main ER is what is called "the big room," though it's not that
big. Ten beds are jammed along one wall. There's a little more space
on the opposite wall for the three beds reserved for patients
suffering from severe trauma. Sick people waiting for beds sit in a
semicircle of plastic chairs.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining empty space is often lined with gurneys, despite a
state order that mandates privacy for patients. "Some days we're
busting at the seams," said Dr. Frederic S. Bongard, director of
trauma services. "Other days we're just full."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday night, the emergency room was somewhere between
those two states.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton, the attending physician, was joined by a clutch of
medical residents. They hovered over a beefy patient high on
"sherms," a marijuana joint dipped in PCP, which had sent him into an
intermittent coma. Every few minutes, the man emerged from the coma
and croaked out a plea for water. There are only six academic papers
giving direction on how to treat a patient like the PCP smoker,
Stratton told the residents. What he did not say until the residents
prodded him is that he had written two of them.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion ended when a traffic victim was rolled in on a
stretcher--a teenage boy with a dislocated hip. The youth's face
turned white as three doctors slowly pushed his leg back into its
socket, taking care not to jostle the PCP patient, still twitching in
the next bed.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor takes car crash victims from stretches of the San Diego,
Harbor, Long Beach and Imperial freeways, as well as the streets of
the South Bay. While three-quarters of the county health system's
patients are uninsured, some, like the youth with the dislocated hip,
come to the emergency room with their insurance cards in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor's fate "affects everyone, whether you're homeless or a
millionaire in Palos Verdes," said Dr. Robert Hockberger, chairman of
the emergency medicine department.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fate of a man from Wilmington, though, that worried
doctors the most on this night.</TE>
<TE>   The middle-aged Latino was wheeled in by paramedics at the end of
the shift. He had two bullets lodged in his thigh, and a cracked
jawbone hanging limply. He was choking on his own blood.</TE>
<TE>   After Stratton managed to guide a tube down his throat to pump air
into his lungs, doctors rushed the man out of the emergency room and
up an elevator to the operating rooms. One room is always on standby
for emergency patients like this one, but the others are busy around
the clock as surgeons perform a steady stream of heart bypasses and
gall bladder procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilmington man would never survive, physicians say, if
management were to choose one cost-cutting option: preserving the
emergency room but shutting surgery down. Patients like him would be
stabilized at Harbor, then taken to County-USC, 20 miles away, for
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   A committee at Harbor is already devising a plan to divert
ambulances to nearby hospitals should Harbor's ER be shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton is on that committee.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty crazy," he said. "You work here and they put you on
the committee to figure out how to close it."</TE>
<TE>   A shut-down would be daunting. Harbor accepted 68,426 emergency
room visits last year, 20% of all county emergency admissions. No one
knows where those sick and injured would have found help otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   While the effect of closing the ER would be profound, there is an
even more far-reaching scenario. If no additional money is found,
plans call for the entire inpatient operation--everything that makes
Harbor a hospital--to shut down. The 340 beds that fill eight floors
would close.</TE>
<TE>   The effects would be felt all the way to Westwood, where Harbor's
closing would deprive UCLA's medical school of coveted slots for
medical students. Harbor's physicians are also members of the UCLA
faculty, and they are assisted by interns and residents who are
technically UCLA students.</TE>
<TE>   More than inpatient care would end. So would support for Harbor's
prestigious Research and Education Institute, which has an annual
budget of $58 million to fund UCLA physicians' studies.</TE>
<TE>   There are nearly 1,000 research projects or clinical trials
underway at the hospital, seeking to advance the treatment of cancer,
diabetes and pediatric health problems, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to protect its funding, the institute recently hired an
attorney with experience in community relations and fund-raising to
lead the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in the South Bay, not enough people know about the
outstanding quality of our research, the number of scientists we
train," President and CEO Kenneth P. Trevett said. "We have been an
underappreciated resource."</TE>
<TE>   The research arm of Harbor pays for itself with grants. But it
could vanish without the raw materials of patients, doctors and
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Besides providing a base for research, public hospitals such as
Harbor operate under conditions that force the medical staff to
develop rare expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the hospital's mandate to treat all comers, doctors at
Harbor become accustomed to treating seldom-seen diseases, some of
them serious, many of them infecting recent immigrants. Recent
ailments seen at the hospital have included tetanus, whooping cough
and necrotizing fasciitis, the contagious skin-eating bacteria. "We
see a case of the flesh-eating bacteria every week," Bongard said.
"It's so frequent that we don't even bother reporting it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   A tour of the intensive-care unit shows why public hospitals are
financial burdens.</TE>
<TE>   The dimly lit wards are nearly silent, punctuated only by the
beeping of machines monitoring the vital signs of patients. Some are
so sick they need nurses at their bedsides constantly.</TE>
<TE>   Bongard pointed to a man who required so many machines to keep him
alive that he had his own room. The elderly man lay in bed, eyes
closed, mouth agape, as six monitors tracked his vital signs. His
body was drained through three cavities. He required regular dialysis
and could breathe only with the aid of a ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   It cost many thousands of dollars to keep the man alive, Bongard
said. He saw no alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "I do what I need to do," he said, "and let someone else consider
the bills."</TE>

<HD>Records Belie Simon on Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: He insists his role in ill-fated partnership was
limited, but court papers show he was involved in every phase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he campaigns for governor, Republican Bill Simon Jr. says he
played almost no role in the business fiasco that led a jury last
week to levy $78 million in damages against his family's investment
firm.</LD>
<LD>   He casts himself as a peripheral player in the William E. Simon &amp;
Sons investment of $16.5 million in the pay phone company of Paul
Edward Hindelang Jr., a convicted drug trafficker who won the Los
Angeles fraud case.</LD>
<LD>   But court records show Simon, who personally lost more than $1
million in the deal, participated in every stage of the partnership:</LD>
<TE>   * Simon, then executive director of the family firm, met Hindelang
after the Pacific Coin founder chose William E. Simon &amp; Sons from a
group of suitors competing to invest in his pay-phone company.</TE>
<TE>   * Simon was co-chairman of the William E. Simon &amp; Sons committee
that reviewed and signed off on the Pacific Coin investment in
February 1998.</TE>
<TE>   * As Pacific Coin sank into financial trouble, Simon detailed his
concerns in writing. When executives at William E. Simon &amp; Sons told
him Pacific Coin needed $2.5 million to meet debt payments, Simon
wrote: "How about we make some money first."</TE>
<TE>   * Simon commissioned a private investigation of Hindelang in
December 1998, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Hindelang
had agreed to forfeit $50 million in illegal drug profits. Simon
picked a firm led by a former colleague at the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office. It found Hindelang had pleaded guilty in 1981 to
charges of smuggling 500,000 pounds of marijuana into the United
States. Simon said he had been unaware of Hindelang's criminal
record.</TE>
<TE>   * Months later, Simon personally assured a Pacific Coin creditor,
Bank of America, that William E. Simon &amp; Sons still strongly
supported the company despite a sharp drop in pay-phone revenue. The
bank and other lenders ultimately seized Pacific Coin for failure to
pay its debts.</TE>
<TE>   After the jury's decision last week, Simon said he "had nothing to
do with" Pacific Coin. He also told reporters, "Frankly, I had very
little involvement with this."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Flint, a senior Simon campaign advisor, said the candidate
had accurately characterized his involvement in Pacific Coin. "He's
been very candid," Flint said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, fallout from the partnership with a man Simon calls
"precisely the kind of criminal I used to pursue" threatens to
undermine Simon's contention that his business acumen prepares him to
lead a state with the world's fifth-largest economy.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's attempt to distance himself from the Pacific Coin deal
also recalls his earlier efforts to play down his role at Western
Federal Savings &amp; Loan, a thrift seized by the government in 1993 at
a cost of $122 million to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Given the timing of the Pacific Coin verdict--14 weeks before the
election--it has become a central focus of the governor's race,
complicating Simon's effort to impugn the integrity of his Democratic
rival, Gov. Gray Davis. Simon already was facing a tough challenge,
as an investment banker seeking public office for the first time in a
political climate dominated by corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, a conservative who trumpets his background as a
prosecutor, the Pacific Coin case is especially harmful because it
shows he did business with a former drug trafficker who served 30
months in prison. Since the verdict, Simon has struggled to contain
the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a federal prosecutor, I fought to keep drug kingpins
off our streets through asset forfeiture and enforcement of our
criminal laws," he said in a statement, "and I certainly am intent on
keeping them out of any businesses that I am involved in."</TE>
<TE>   He said his firm "engaged a number of independent consultants to
conduct due diligence" on Pacific Coin, but the background check on
Hindelang only "went back 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   "His conviction went back a little bit longer than that," Simon
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   At a Superior Court hearing Monday, William H. Lancaster, a lawyer
for William E. Simon &amp; Sons, urged Judge James C. Chalfant to set
aside the verdict. The case affects "the politics of the state," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this stage," the judge responded, "I really don't think I
should be concerned about that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon Jr. met Ed Hindelang for the first time in late 1997 at
the William E. Simon &amp; Sons office in Westwood, and the two would
later play tennis in La Quinta, according to Hindelang's lawyer,
Geoffrey Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years after his release from the federal prison camp in
Lompoc, Hindelang was a wealthy Santa Barbara entrepreneur who kept
quiet about his criminal past. He owned and ran Pacific Coin of Van
Nuys, one of the biggest independent pay-phone companies in the West.
He started with 14 pay phones in 1986, but now had 8,000 spread
across Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to put money into Pacific Coin was up to the Simon
firm's investment committee. Simon was its co-chairman. When the
committee debated Pacific Coin, Simon raised questions about growing
competition from cellular phones, according to Henry Brandon III, an
executive at Simon's firm.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big concern to him," Brandon testified.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and the rest of the committee approved the deal anyway. In
February 1998, an investment group led by William E. Simon &amp; Sons
took control of Pacific Coin. The new owners kept Hindelang, who
retained an interest in Pacific Coin, as chief executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   In the fraud case he later filed, Hindelang argued that the Simon
investors concealed from him--until the last minute--their plan to
charge Pacific Coin several million dollars in investment banking
fees. The Pacific Coin acquisition produced more than $1 million in
fees for William E. Simon &amp; Sons, but the firm denied hiding its
intent to charge them.</TE>
<TE>   Also hidden from Hindelang--fraudulently, the jury found--was the
Simon group's high-risk plan to borrow tens of millions of dollars to
expand Pacific Coin, then take it public a few months later in a
stock offering. Had it worked, the plan could have made the Simon
investors a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the Simon group took control, Pacific Coin
borrowed $42 million to buy Golden Tel, a company with 5,000 pay
phones, mainly in Las Vegas. The deal produced $390,000 in fees for
William E. Simon &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   But flaws in the strategy quickly emerged. A slowdown in pay-phone
revenue made a stock offering less and less likely. Somehow, Pacific
Coin needed to keep its lenders at bay. A request for money landed on
the desk of Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The internal William E. Simon &amp; Sons memo, dated Sept. 15, 1998,
would be the clearest record of Simon's personal engagement in the
Pacific Coin mess.</TE>
<TE>   The confidential memo, written by two of the firm's investment
managers, chronicled Pacific Coin's growing financial troubles. It
recommended that William E. Simon &amp; Sons put another $2.5 million
into the company for debt payments. Simon is the first of nine
executives named on the cover page as recipients of the memo.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to spend some time understanding this situation,"
Simon wrote at the top of the memo, later introduced in court. "When
it rains, it pours."</TE>
<TE>   Simon underlined 13 passages in the 10-page memo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is interesting," he jotted in the margin next to a section
that reported a $3-million shortfall in pay-phone revenue.</TE>
<TE>   On the following page, the authors said the use of pay phones had
dropped sharply when the price per call rose from 20 cents to 35
cents. "Interesting," Simon scribbled again. "I wonder how much of
this is due to mobile phones."</TE>
<TE>   The memo projected a future revenue loss of up to $6.9 million.
"This is big," Simon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   It reported a plan to sell the company's Texas pay phones for $3
million. "Was this disposition part of the original game plan?" Simon
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also learned from the memo that the cost of installing new
Golden Tel phones at the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casinos was
straining Pacific Coin's ability to pay its debt. Money from the
phones, it turned out, would not come in for months.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't we know about this?" Simon scrawled in the margin.</TE>
<TE>   Simon raised doubts about a plan to persuade banks to restructure
Pacific Coin's loans. "They will probably say no," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The memo reported that Pacific Coin had to make a $2-million debt
payment within two weeks. "Wow!" Simon wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On the page outlining how much Pacific Coin needed immediately
from William E. Simon &amp; Sons, he jotted, "How about we make some
money first." Simon also inquired about fellow Pacific Coin
investors: "Did Tom and Bill put up? How much?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite his interest in such details, Simon, whose firm ultimately
agreed to put up the requested money, testified under oath in May
2002 that he recalled nothing about the memo and the things he wrote
on it. Anthony C. Duffy, a lawyer for Hindelang, asked Simon if his
notes reflected his concerns about Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I just can't say, because I don't really remember
reading the memo," Simon testified in the videotaped deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Simon read each of his handwritten notes aloud, but said the
document "doesn't refresh my memory."</TE>
<TE>   Was Simon concerned that the Pacific Coin investment was not going
well?</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I just don't remember," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   What did he mean by "when it rains, it pours"?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Why did he find the $3-million shortfall "interesting"?</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't remember what I was thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Did he recall learning that the use of pay phones was dropping?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember reading the document, so I can't be quizzed on
the contents of the document."</TE>
<TE>   Simon was not entirely forgetful. Asked whether he recalled that
he "wanted to see some money being made out of this company before
you put any more capital in," he responded: "I think that's a fair
statement."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he could not recall talking to other executives at his
firm about Pacific Coin's troubles, nor whether anyone answered his
handwritten questions. Simon said he would normally keep asking such
questions until he received a satisfactory response, but added: "I'm
a nice fellow. I might go away at some point."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A week before Christmas 1998, the Wall Street Journal brought
disturbing news: Hindelang had been part of a Colombian marijuana
smuggling ring in the late 1970s, and two decades later he had agreed
to forfeit $50-million in drug profits to the U.S. attorney's office
in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Simon commissioned an urgent background check on Hindelang.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder about the truth of things that appear in the press,"
Simon recalled in his deposition. "And so I thought it was useful to
try to figure out what exactly was happening and whether or not, you
know, what they said in the article was accurate."</TE>
<TE>   At Simon's behest, William E. Simon &amp; Sons hired a New York
investigation firm, Decision Strategies/Fairfax International, where
Phil Stern, a former colleague from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office, was senior managing director.</TE>
<TE>   Stern faxed his confidential report on Hindelang to Simon's
Pacific Palisades home. The New York Times, Associated Press and
United Press International had reported the news in stories now
rolling through Simon's fax machine: Hindelang was indeed a convicted
drug trafficker.</TE>
<TE>   He had been indicted in Louisiana for importing 500,000 pounds of
marijuana and conspiring to import another 150,000 pounds. The dope
arrived in freighters off the Florida coast, then shipments were
transferred to smaller fishing and recreational boats for the final
journey to the U.S. shore.</TE>
<TE>   When Hindelang pleaded guilty in 1981, he agreed to forfeit
$640,000 in drug proceeds. But he had hidden millions more, some of
it in Swiss bank accounts. By the late 1990s federal agents had
tracked it down. So in December 1997--at the same time the Simon
partnership in Pacific Coin was taking shape--Hindelang had flown to
Miami to meet with federal prosecutors and negotiate the deal to
forfeit $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of those secret talks, the Simon group had approved a
five-year employment agreement for Hindelang to remain as chief
executive at Pacific Coin. Upon word of the forfeiture, he was
suspended, then fired months later.</TE>
<TE>   Hindelang's criminal lawyer, Harlan Braun, said no one from the
Simon firm had asked the Pacific Coin founder whether he had any
felony convictions, and it was not information he was required to
volunteer nearly two decades later.</TE>
<TE>   In Hindelang's absence, Pacific Coin deteriorated. Debt problems
worsened. Simon told one lender, Bank of America, that Pacific Coin's
investors still strongly supported the company, according to a bank
document. But the lenders not only tightened credit on Pacific Coin,
they also blocked the Simon firm from further depleting the company
by collecting investment-banking fees.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in December 2000, the lenders seized Pacific Coin, wiping
out the investments of Simon, Hindelang and their partners.</TE>
<TE>   By Hindelang's account, the Simon group abandoned the company to
"take advantage of the tax deductions from the resulting losses."
Simon's personal income tax returns show he wrote off $1.2 million in
Pacific Coin losses in 1999 and 2000, but a spokesman denied that he
neglected the company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the Simon campaign, Hindelang's lawsuit was fraught with
political danger.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Hindelang's lawyers subpoenaed Simon for a deposition.
Six months later, after his surprise victory in the Republican
primary, Simon's lawyers tried to quash the subpoena, saying
Hindelang was trying to embarrass and harass a candidate who was "at
best peripherally involved" in Pacific Coin. Simon's time was
"extremely limited in pursuit of the state's highest public office,"
his lawyer, Brent M. Finch, wrote in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Hindelang's lawyers, Duffy and Ronald M. Oster, argued that Simon
was "directly involved in all stages of the Pacific Coin investment."
Simon's effort failed and he was forced to testify May 28 and 29 in a
videotaped deposition. His testimony was condensed into a short
videotape for the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Had he ever met Hindelang?</TE>
<TE>   "I have," Simon testified.</TE>
<TE>   Did Simon participate in the decision to invest in Pacific Coin?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember."</TE>
<TE>   Did anyone tell him whether the Simon firm had lost its investment
in Pacific Coin?</TE>
<TE>   "No. Not to the best of my recollection."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, because of a tight trial schedule, Hindelang's lawyers
let the case go to the jury without playing the Simon video. The jury
ordered Simon's firm to pay $13.3 million in compensatory damages and
$65 million in punitive damages to Pacific Coin Management, a company
owned almost entirely by Hindelang.</TE>
<TE>   The jury rejected a claim by the Simon investors that Hindelang
had defrauded them by concealing his criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   After the trial, Simon called the verdict "fundamentally flawed"
and vowed to appeal. He told reporters that the trial boiled down to
whether jurors took the word of a former drug trafficker over that of
William E. Simon &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   "The jury believed Hindelang," Simon concluded. "I think that's it
in a nutshell."</TE>

<HD>Twins Separated in 22-Hour Operation</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors say outlook is positive despite
complications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a 22-hour operation, a team of UCLA surgeons Tuesday separated
1-year-old twins who had been conjoined at the head, an operation
that drew attention from Los Angeles to the infants' hometown in
Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital said that the surgery
went well, but that it will be at least a week before Maria Teresa
and Maria de Jesus Quiej Alvarez are out of danger.</LD>
<LD>   "They're through the critical phase," Dr. Michael Karpf, director
of UCLA Medical Center, said after the separation was completed. He
said the surgery "was the first major step, and it was really quite
successful."</LD>
<TE>   But at 9:17 a.m. Tuesday, Maria Teresa was rushed back to the
operating room to relieve pressure on her brain caused by a hematoma,
a pooling of blood under the scalp.</TE>
<TE>   After five more hours of surgery, the pressure had been reduced,
and the surgeons said she was recovering well. Doctors are not sure
what caused the hematoma.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation will remain life- threatening for both the twins
for several days," Karpf said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jorge Lazareff, the pediatric neurosurgeon who coordinated the
separation of Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus, said, "When they smile
back to us, then we'll know they're back to normal."</TE>
<TE>   Plastic surgeon Henry Kawamoto said doctors were too busy during
the surgery to take note of the dramatic moment at which the actual
separation occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not a celebratory experience," he said. "The separation
occurred, and we just went on to the next step. It wasn't like we
were all drinking champagne and crying and laughing. This was a
planned operation. It was planned well and executed well. And this
was just the next step."</TE>
<TE>   After Maria Teresa's additional surgery to relieve the hematoma,
she was taken to the same room as her sister in the pediatric
intensive care unit. Both are anesthetized and breathing with the
help of a respirator.</TE>
<TE>   The surgery was the talk of the girls' hometown, where residents
held candlelight vigils at churches and raised money for the twins'
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're watching the news [on television] and listening to the
radio," said Ricardo Figueroa, an official from Santo Domingo
Suchitepequez, a regional center near Aldea Belen, the impoverished
coastal town where the family lives.</TE>
<TE>   "When they come back, we're going to give them a big party, with
lots of presents."</TE>
<TE>   In June, an international medical charity, Healing the Children,
brought the Guatemalan infants, who shared a skull and some important
blood vessels and faced in opposite directions, to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The twins came to UCLA with their mother, Alba Leticia Alvarez.
Their father, Wenceslao Quiej-Lopez, joined them Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   After conducting several neurological tests, physicians and
surgeons confirmed that separation was feasible but risky.</TE>
<TE>   The twins entered the operating room at 7:53 a.m. Monday. A
reconstructive surgeon made the initial incisions at 1:49 p.m. to
create skin flaps he would later need to cover the defect in their
skulls. In the end, he had to use some grafts from their scalp to
avoid leaving any brain exposed.</TE>
<TE>   The twins were separated at 12:56 a.m. Tuesday, and doctors
immediately began reconstructing the girls' scalps. The surgery was
completed at 5:40 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Teresa, whose hematoma forced her return to the operating
room less than four hours later, experienced considerable blood loss
during the separation surgery but it was unclear if that had anything
to do with the hematoma, said Dr. Swati Patel, one of the three
pediatric anesthesiologists involved in the case</TE>
<TE>   Patel said Maria de Jesus used only about five units of blood, but
Maria Teresa required at least 19.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Lopez, a cousin of the twins' father, said that after the
surgeries were over, the girls' parents visited a nearby church.</TE>
<TE>   "They went to thank God everything is OK," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lazareff said he is not sure what, if any, subsequent problems
might arise. "It depends on the types or areas of brain damage that
might have occurred," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kawamoto said that the surgery left the girls' heads somewhat
misshapen, but that subsequent plastic surgery could correct that.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal was to get them separated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 UCLA staff members were involved in the operation.
The physicians and surgeons donated their services. UCLA hopes to
recoup the cost of the twins' care, estimated at $1.5 million,
through contributions to a fund set up in their name.</TE>
<TE>   Healing the Children is collecting money as well.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Jessica Garrison and Eric Malnic and Times
wire services contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Recall Sought of Air Bags in Some Nissans</HD>
<DH>Safety: An advocacy group says devices have a high
eye-injury rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A consumer advocacy group is urging federal investigators to order a
recall of passenger-side air bags in some Nissan Motor Co. Altimas
because of blinding eye injuries linked to inflation of the devices.</LD>
<LD>   Public Citizen, which says the air bags in the Altimas from 1994
and early in the 1995 model year have a permanent eye-injury rate
many times that of other cars, has scheduled a news conference for
today at which two injured passengers will speak.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began looking
at the bags in March of last year, citing five complaints it had
received and 24 incidents brought to its attention by a plaintiff's
lawyer. The agency upgraded its preliminary probe to an engineering
analysis a year ago, citing 32 eye injuries, 15 of which were serious
enough to require days of hospitalization or resulted in partial or
full loss of vision in a least one eye after 12 months. About 250,000
of the vehicles are still on the road.</LD>
<TE>   "We are asking them [the traffic safety agency] to hurry up and
get this air bag out of the fleet," said Joan Claybrook, president of
Public Citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan spokesman Scott Vazin said that eye injuries related to air
bags are nothing new and that they are not unique to Altimas.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working diligently and responsibly with NHTSA, and it's
premature to talk publicly about an ongoing investigation," Vazin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those hurt were wearing seat belts at the time of injury,
the agency said. Many injuries and deaths linked to other air bags
have involved unrestrained occupants coming too close to the
inflating bag due to precrash braking or the crash itself.</TE>

<HD>'Powerful' Sept. 11 Observances Set</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A year after the attack on the World Trade Center, somber ceremonies
will stress the historic courage of the American people and the
intense pain of the tragedy--symbolized by a single rose for each of
the 2,823 victims, officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 observances will feature the mournful sound of
bagpipes, the clear notes of taps, a reading of the Gettysburg
Address and moments of silence to mark the time the first hijacked
plane hit the north tower and the destruction of the south tower.</LD>
<LD>   It will also include candlelight vigils, the kindling of an
eternal flame and a massive presence of heads of state who will be in
New York for the United Nations General Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the most poignant moment will be the procession down a
long ramp by family members to the lowest level of the trade center
site, to soil that many of them consider sacred ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent is to have a day of observances that are simple and
powerful, that honor the memories of those we lost that day," said
New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who announced New York's plans
with Gov. George Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   "The physical damage and loss of life took place here. The
emotional carnage and the attack on freedom really took place around
the world."</TE>
<TE>   The extensively televised event, one of several solemn ceremonies
planned in New York and across the country, could well serve as a
national memorial, much as the funeral of President Kennedy did
nearly 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, where 189 people were killed when American
Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west side of the building,
President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Air Force
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will
speak at a ceremony that will be televised but closed to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Bush will travel to the rural site near
Shanksville, Pa., where 44 people died aboard United Flight 93, one
of four airliners seized by the terrorists. He will then travel to
New York.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, where two of the doomed jets took off, Linda Plazonja
of the Massachusetts 9-11 Fund said her organization will begin the
day with a breakfast for families of victims and political
dignitaries, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, a silent parade of community leaders, elected
officials and citizens will travel to a downtown park about a mile
from the Space Needle. Last year, thousands of flowers were left at a
fountain that became the city's unofficial memorial after Sept. 11.
The flowers were gathered by the city and composted. Each marcher
will receive a bulb, in mulch generated by the original memorial
flowers, to plant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's meant to be a symbol of renewal, to rekindle a sense of
hope," said Casey Corr, communications director for Mayor Greg
Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   Events are also planned in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and
Portland, Ore., among other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The New York ceremony, memorializing the massive number of
casualties, will present Americans with an opportunity to find
strength in agony, officials and observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the symbolism is important for all of us, the whole
nation," Walter Cronkite, the retired CBS anchorman and commentator
who covered World War II and the Kennedy assassination, said from his
home in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. "There never will be closure for
families of those whose bodies were never found. But there will be a
form of closure for the nation on this first anniversary."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to live coverage of the anniversary, television
networks will air programs ranging from an exclusive interview with
Bush on CBS to a two-hour "Concert for America" on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gralnick, a television news veteran who worked for ABC, NBC
and CBS, said the Sept. 11 commemoration is unique among first
anniversaries of major tragedies of the last four decades.</TE>
<TE>   While the 1960s assassinations of President Kennedy, his brother
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., as well
as the 1986 space shuttle explosion, received extensive coverage when
they occurred, there was relatively little airtime devoted to them a
year later. Sept. 11 "stands alone in this regard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   New York's memorial will begin with a procession of bagpipers from
each of the city's five boroughs to the trade center site. A citywide
moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. will mark the time that American
Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the center's north tower.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki will recite the Gettysburg Address at the memorial before
former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani begins reading the first section of
the 2,823 names of people who perished in the attack. Other readers
will include family members and people who lost co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   When the reading is completed, a bugler will play taps and New
Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey will read a portion of the Declaration
of Independence. The memorial will conclude after another moment of
silence at 10:30 a.m., the time the south tower collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, houses of worship will be asked to toll bells and the
procession of family members will walk down the ramp seven stories to
what was once the base of the twin towers. Later in the day, Bush is
scheduled to visit the site.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, Bloomberg and heads of state will light an eternal
flame in Battery Park, near the trade center. When the flame is
ignited, New Yorkers will be encouraged to hold candlelight vigils in
parks and on street corners throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Also in New York, the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which had
offices in the twin towers and lost 658 employees, will have a
private remembrance in Manhattan's Central Park. The Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey plans its own memorial service for its 75
workers who were killed. Some firehouses will hold ceremonies for
firefighters who perished.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen plays on Broadway plan to cancel performances,
but Bloomberg said he expects schools and businesses to remain open.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said that plans for the anniversary were formed with
"particular attention" to advice from family members who lost loved
ones.</TE>
<TE>   And Christy Ferer, the mayor's liaison with the victims'
families--and whose husband, Neil Levin, director of the Port
Authority, which operated the twin towers, was killed--stressed the
importance for the grieving relatives to be able to visit the site.</TE>
<TE>   "For them, it remains a cemetery," she said with tears in her
eyes. "Think of what you do a year after someone dies. You go to the
cemetery, you pay your respects, you lay the stone, you lay a flower.
The mayor and the governor have seen to it that the families can go
down that ramp and do that, because for them that is sacred ground."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Elizabeth Mehren in Boston, Greg Braxton in
Los Angeles, Vicki Kemper in Washington, David Zucchino in
Philadelphia and researchers Lynette Ferdinand in New York, John
Beckham in Chicago and Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Aspirin, already widely used by people hoping to ward off heart
attacks, may also be helpful in preventing often-deadly pancreatic
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   University of Minnesota researchers studied the use of aspirin and
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by 28,283 postmenopausal
women.</LD>
<LD>   They found that those who took aspirin had a 43% lower rate of
pancreatic cancer than nonusers, and that the risk of the cancer
declined with increasing frequency of aspirin use.</LD>
<TE>   The findings are reported in today's issue of the Journal of the

<HD>Texas Medical Center Recalls Untested Body Parts</HD>
<DH>Diseases: Remains may have been used in tissue transplants
and could carry the AIDS virus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GALVESTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>A medical center whose handling of cadavers has come under FBI
investigation said Tuesday that it is recalling body parts sent to
research institutions around the country, warning they may carry the
AIDS virus or other infections.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Texas Medical Branch said records kept by a
former employee are so poor that there is a chance the
parts--including feet, knees and elbows--have been used in tissue
transplants.</LD>
<LD>   "We deeply regret this has happened. We make no excuses for it,"
said Steven Lieberman, associate dean for educational affairs.</LD>
<TE>   The medical center ordered the recall because the unpreserved
remains may not have been properly tested for hepatitis and HIV
before they were shipped.</TE>
<TE>   The remains are primarily used to train doctors in surgical
techniques and are not intended for use in transplants. But the
medical center said it could not be sure that ligaments, cartilage
and other tissue were not used that way.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center called the risk to public health "negligible
and probably zero," but said it could not guarantee that transplant
patients are safe from infection.</TE>
<TE>   It urged researchers who received parts under its Willed Body
Program from November 2000 to May 2002 to send the parts back.</TE>
<TE>   For now, a list of the sites that received the body parts won't be
made public because of a federal investigation of the Willed Body
Program, the medical center said.</TE>
<TE>   The parts may have been sent to as many as 60 research programs
nationwide. The medical center began notifying the institutions this
week, and it said researchers should protect themselves when handling
the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "With these precautions, the risks go way down," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said he could not account for how many parts had been
shipped out during the 18 months in question. He said the medical
center is not legally required to test the parts for infectious
diseases, but such testing is expected within the medical community.</TE>
<TE>   The Willed Body Program received about 300 bodies a year that had
been left to science.</TE>
<TE>   The Willed Body Program was shut down earlier this year and is
already under investigation by the FBI, which is looking into
allegations that an employee sold donated remains and that donors'
ashes were mingled.</TE>
<TE>   The employee, Allen Tyler Jr., 56, worked in the program for 36
years before being fired May 9. Tyler has not been charged with a
crime. He did not return a message Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>   The state agreed to change the ballot for its gubernatorial
primary after the Democrats complained in a lawsuit that the wording
would lead to the kind of confusion seen during the 2000 election
debacle.</LD>
<TE>   The original Sept. 10 ballot instructed voters to "vote for one
pair," meaning they should pick one candidate and his or her running
mate. But the running mates have not been selected yet, and their
names were not on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Democrats said, some voters might become confused
and make two choices, which would nullify their ballot.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Day Shapes Up Well and He Ships Out to Texas</HD>
<DH>Politics: A physical reveals the president is in 'excellent
health.' He signs trade authority bill and then begins a working
vacation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush was feeling very good Tuesday, and who could blame
him?</LD>
<LD>   After a thorough annual physical, his doctors pronounced him "in
excellent health and fit for duty."</LD>
<LD>   The president also signed a hard-won bill that grants him broad
authority to negotiate trade agreements.</LD>
<TE>   Above all, he was home at last at his beloved Prairie Chapel
Ranch, where he intends to spend the rest of this month, mixing work
with pure R&amp;R in the blazing Central Texas heat.</TE>
<TE>   "The president will continue to focus on his three big priorities:
winning the war on terrorism, protecting the homeland and
strengthening our economy," said deputy White House press secretary
Scott McClellan.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Bush plans to travel to at least 15 cities, including
some in California, and will hold an economic forum in Waco on Aug.
13 to highlight his initiatives aimed at revitalizing the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Bush began the day by announcing in the Rose Garden that he will
convene a White House conference this fall to focus on ways to better
protect U.S. children from harm.</TE>
<TE>   Then he headed off to Bethesda Naval Hospital in suburban Maryland
for his annual physical.</TE>
<TE>   The first sign of the findings came not from the president but Dr.
Kenneth Cooper, one of the supervising physicians.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," Cooper told reporters, giving a double thumbs-up
sign for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   In a subsequent statement signed by Cooper and seven other
doctors, the panel reportedBush's cardiovascular fitness and aerobic
capacity rank in the top 1% of men for his age--indeed, in the top 5%
for men ages 35 to 39, they added. Bush turned 56 last month.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-tall president weighed in at 189 pounds, three-quarters
of a pound less than last year. He takes vitamins and an aspirin
daily.</TE>
<TE>   As noted in previous years, Bush suffers from minor allergies, a
slight high-frequency hearing loss and minor lower back pain, a
condition brought on by weightlifting.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors found no evidence of heart disease and said the
president's cholesterol levels were all in the desirable or optimal
range. They said he is in a "very low" coronary risk category.</TE>
<TE>   After the physical, Bush returned to the White House to sign the
trade promotion authority bill.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, as the economy has slumped, the president
repeatedly called on Congress to send him the legislation, calling it
a vital tool in revitalizing the economy.</TE>
<TE>   At the signing ceremony, Bush vowed to vigorously pursue free
trade negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The bill restores to the presidency authority that lapsed in 1994
to negotiate agreements that Congress can approve or reject but
cannot amend.</TE>
<TE>   "And now, after eight years, America is back in the business of
promoting open trade to build our prosperity and to spur economic
growth," Bush said. "With trade promotion authority, the trade
agreements I negotiate will have an up-or-down vote in Congress,
giving other countries the confidence to negotiate with us.</TE>
<TE>   "Starting now, America is back at the bargaining table in full
force. I will use trade promotion authority aggressively to create
more good jobs for American workers, more exports for American
farmers and higher living standards for American families."</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after signing the legislation, Bush left for Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the president is scheduled to travel to Jackson, Miss., to
deliver a speech on economic security and then attend a fund-raiser
for Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering (R-Miss.).</TE>

<HD>California Plucks a First Line of Defense Against West Nile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State health officials Tuesday vowed to remain on the alert for the
deadly West Nile virus with their own version of an early warning
system--chickens.</LD>
<LD>   Scattered in about 200 locations around the state, 2,000 "sentinel
chickens" are the first line of defense against the mosquito-borne
disease. Every two weeks, health workers test blood samples from the
chickens, looking for the telltale antibodies that are a sign of
infection by disease-carrying mosquitoes.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Reilly of the California Department of Health Services said
the virus is likely to arrive in the state within the next two years
and that early detection is the best way to protect the public.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not a question of if it's going to show up in California but
when," Reilly said. "But we're lucky. In California, we've had
80-plus years of mosquito control."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time the virus produces only severe flu-like symptoms,
but in rare cases it leads to life-threatening swelling of the brain.</TE>

<HD>Police Officers Face New Hazard: Assault by Air Bag</HD>
<DH>Safety: Laptop computers, other gear mounted in path of the
passenger-side device can become missiles if a patrol car crashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One patrol officer had his nose broken by a laptop computer. Another
was smacked with the butt of his shotgun and knocked unconscious. A
third got poked in the eye by wires from his radar unit and lost part
of his vision.</LD>
<LD>   The culprit in each case was not a raging assailant, but the
passenger-side air bag in the cops' squad cars. When an air bag
deploys in a crash, it can turn equipment unwittingly mounted in its
path into a high-energy missile, safety experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Laptop computers, cell phones, radar units and other technological
accessories of the modern police cruiser have become hazards for
officers in crashes, according to federal and independent
investigators. Police officers may soon join children, small women
and the elderly on the list of those at risk of airbag injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an issue that needs to be brought to the attention of the
law enforcement community," said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is issuing a
safety alert this week. "As time goes on, they are adding more and
more equipment to these patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure they don't mistakenly install something in
the direct path of an air bag."</TE>
<TE>   The precise number of officers injured in such accidents is
unknown, but Dave Long, an air-bag safety consultant for North
Memorial Medical Center near Minneapolis, said he has collected
information on at least 20 cases. NHTSA has investigated one crash,
involving a Louisiana police officer hurt by a flying laptop computer
when his patrol car hit the back of a transit bus last summer, Tyson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most cops are not willing to give out information about this,"
said Long. "It's not something you're really proud of. They don't
want to say they busted a $2,000 computer, got an officer hurt and
stuff was whooshing through the air."</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol, which has a fleet of about 2,500
cruisers, became aware of the problem several years ago through its
own testing, said Capt. B.J. Hall, commander of the motor transport
section. The tests involved setting off the passenger-side air bag
and recording the results.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a video, and the first time we tried it, we found we would
have knocked some equipment into the driver," said Hall. "We make
sure we don't mount anything in the deployment zone."</TE>
<TE>   Many smaller departments do not have budgets for testing or for
complicated installation of equipment. Some have used bungee cords to
strap gear down on top of the dash.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen how some people got their stuff mounted, and it scares
me," said Hall, who added that he was not aware of any injuries to
CHP officers.</TE>
<TE>   Air bag deaths have dropped from a high of 53 in 1997 to five
confirmed fatalities last year. Traffic safety officers have played
an important role in this trend by enforcing seat-belt laws and
encouraging parents to put their children in the back seat. But when
it comes to their own safety, the cops seemingly have a blind spot.</TE>
<TE>   Long, who works with police, fire and rescue units, said he
informally surveyed official vehicles at a highway safety conference
last summer. About one-third of more than 300 vehicles in the parking
lot had gear installed in front of the passenger-side air bag.</TE>
<TE>   Police and fire departments have two options to avoid problems:
They can make sure that any accessories are installed out of the way
of the air bag by following instructions issued by manufacturers, or
they can have a switch installed to turn off the passenger-side air
bag. Neither solution is considered ideal.</TE>
<TE>   The center console of most cruisers is safe from an air bag
deployment, but it simply does not offer a lot of space for mounting
equipment. "By the time you add six electronic items, it gets very
narrow," Long said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the CHP mounts its laptop computers so they are under
the path of a deploying air bag. But some officers don't find that
very convenient. "They like to have it close, so they can type and
keep an eye on things at the same time," said Long.</TE>
<TE>   The other solution, a switch to turn off the air bag, requires an
application for permission from the federal government. It can cost
$200 to $300 per vehicle to install the switch.</TE>
<TE>   "Many departments do not know where to go get the air bag
deactivated," said Long. "Many dealerships do not want to do this
type of work, because they don't want the liability."</TE>
<TE>   In the future, police cars may come with most of their equipment
built in. After all, manufacturers are currently installing video
systems and navigational computers on their high-end models for
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the proliferation of added-on electronic gear is likely
to continue, particularly with increased anti-terrorism funding to
better equip first responders.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't mount the equipment in exactly the right place,"
said Long, "you can get a computer hitting a cop's face at 200 miles
per hour."</TE>

<HD>Dingell Holds Off Stiff Challenge to Win Democratic Race</HD>
<DH>Primary: Longest-serving House member defeats a much
younger female colleague in a test for voters in a newly drawn
Michigan district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Averting an embarrassing defeat for a legendary power broker in
Congress, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) Tuesday beat back a
surprisingly strong challenge from another, much younger House
incumbent.</LD>
<LD>   Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House, triumphed in
Michigan's Democratic primary over Rep. Lynn N. Rivers, a four-term
House member who was thrown into a face-off with the veteran
congressman when the GOP-led state Legislature redrew House district
lines after the 2000 census.</LD>
<LD>   Within hours after the polls closed and with Dingell leading, 62%
to 38%, Rivers conceded defeat. "The fight for gun safety, the fight
for the right to choose and the fight for the environment is not
done, and I'll be back," Rivers said.</LD>
<TE>   The contest between Dingell and Rivers offered a stark contrast of
style and generation to voters in the newly drawn House district,
which stretches from the blue-collar outskirts of Detroit that were
the core of Dingell's support to Ann Arbor, the more liberal
university town that was the heart of Rivers' domain.</TE>
<TE>   ''She did make us work, I want to say,'' Dingell said Tuesday
night. ''The primary this year was extremely difficult.''</TE>
<TE>   Dingell, 76, campaigned on the long record of major legislation he
has helped to enact in his 47 years in the House--both as longtime
chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee and as a leading member
of the opposition after Republicans took control of Congress in 1995.
Rivers, 45, described herself as someone in touch with the concerns
of ordinary voters, citing her hard-knocks-life story as a teenage
mother married to an auto worker and struggling to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   That made the race a test, in part, of how much voters would value
seniority and legislative experience over a fresh voice from outside
the political establishment who was more focused on liberal social
causes.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates have liberal voting records on most issues. But
there were significant national issues at stake in their differences,
and the race drew tremendous interest and money from political
activists around the country. Dingell's triumph was a victory for the
auto industry, which is central to his district, and gun
owners--causes that are often eschewed by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers, more liberal on gun-control and environment issues, is
also a more consistent abortion rights backer. That helped earn her
the strong and well-financed support of women's political groups that
feared the defeat of one of the still-small pool of women in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the Democratic primary is considered a shoo-in to
win the general election because the party has an overwhelming
advantage in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan-based pollster, said that Rivers' campaign
drew strength from women and from voters who may have valued
Dingell's seniority but believed it was time for a change. He has
served in the House since 1955, when he won a special election upon
the death of his father, who had held the seat since 1933.</TE>
<TE>   But the push for change and a bigger voice for women was not
enough to overpower Dingell's advantages in power, campaign
contributions and legislative clout. Over the course of his career,
Dingell established himself as one of the House's premier power
brokers; even when Congress was under GOP control, he helped craft
major bills affecting health, telecommunication policy and gun
rights. Meanwhile, Michigan's attorney general easily beat two
veteran politicians for the Democratic nomination for governor in one
of the party's toughest battlegrounds in this year's primary season.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian-born Jennifer Granholm easily beat Rep. David E. Bonior
and former Gov. James Blanchard. Granholm, a relative political
newcomer in only her second race, will face Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus
in the November election. He easily beat State Sen. Joe Schwarz for
the Republican nomination for governor. Republican Gov. John Engler
was unable to run again because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan was one of three states holding primaries Tuesday. In
Missouri, U.S. Sen. Jean Carnahan easily won the Democratic primary.
She was appointed to fill her husband Mel Carnahan's seat after he
died in a plane crash in October 2000, shortly before the election.
It was too late for his name to be taken off the ballot and Mel
Carnahan defeated Sen. John Ashcroft, now the U.S. attorney general,
for the Senate seat. Jean Carnahan will face former Rep. Jim Talent
in November.</TE>
<TE>   In Kansas, U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts won the Republican primary in an
easy matchup with Tom Oyler, a retired Boeing engineer and farmer.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for Kansas governor, state Treasurer Tim Shallenburger
defeated two other Republicans in the contest to succeed Gov. Bill
Graves, who is stepping down after eight years because of term
limits. Shallenburger's two opponents, Wichita Mayor Bob Knight and
state Senate President Dave Kerr, conceded late Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican winner now faces Democrat Kathleen Sebelius, the
state's popular insurance commissioner, who is the daughter of former
Ohio Gov. John Gilligan.</TE>

<HD>Soil-Clogged Engines Blamed for Fatal Afghan Helicopter
Crash</HD>
<DH>Military: Air-intake problem and excessive altitude of
Marine craft are also cited in report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Marine Corps helicopter that crashed in Afghanistan last January,
killing two Marines and injuring five others, lost power because its
engines were clogged with powdery soil and it was flying at too high
an altitude, according to a report issued here Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, done by Marine Corps lawyers and helicopter
commanders, praised the helicopter pilot for bravery but criticized
the pilot of another helicopter for leaving the scene without landing
to search for survivors.</LD>
<LD>   The CH-53E Super Stallion crashed Jan. 19 in the snowy mountains
near Kabul after one engine began losing power and a second engine
shut down completely because of a compressor failure, the report
said.</LD>
<TE>   The compressor had been set at an air-intake level that was
inappropriate for the high altitude where air becomes thinner. The
helicopter, near its maximum load, was at about 9,000 feet when it
lost power and crashed within 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Marines were operating in a war zone without their
full range of equipment, the testing apparatus that would have
spotted the air-intake problem in a preflight check was not readily
available.</TE>
<TE>   The engine that lost power was choked with the silt-like dust that
has bedeviled troops and equipment throughout the U.S. offensive in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Killed instantly in the crash were Staff Sgt. Walter F. Cohee III,
26, of Mardela Springs, Md., and Staff Sgt. Dwight J. Morgan, 24, of
Willits, in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   All seven crew members were assigned to a squadron known as the
Flying Tigers based here at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   The report said the death toll would have been higher except for
the quick thinking and bravery of the pilot, then-Capt. Douglas V.
Glasgow.</TE>
<TE>   When the three-engine helicopter lost most of its power and began
falling rapidly, Glasgow was able to slow down its rate of descent
and keep the helicopter from nose-diving.</TE>
<TE>   After the helicopter crashed and exploded, Glasgow pulled his
injured co-pilot, Capt. William J. Cody, from the burning craft and
then--despite back injuries--made several trips to rescue other
injured crew members while the helicopter burned and ammunition began
"cooking off."</TE>
<TE>   "With complete disregard for his personal injuries and the
extremely cold conditions, Capt. Glasgow continued to care for his
crew and watched the area for enemy threats," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Glasgow, a graduate of the Naval Academy and stationed at Yuma,
Ariz., has since been promoted to major.</TE>
<TE>   But the report criticized Capt. Alison Thompson, commander of the
lead helicopter, for flying back to base after incorrectly concluding
there were no survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson made the decision to leave after determining it was too
risky to land near the rocky crash site, according to the report. The
survivors were spotted by cameras in an unmanned reconnaissance
aircraft and rescued by Army helicopters two hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's decision was "contrary to training" and "prolong[ed]
the suffering of the mishap air crew survivors and expose[d] them to
risk and capture," according to an addendum to the report inserted by
Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., commanding general of the 3rd Marine
Aircraft Wing. A copy of the report will be sent to her superior
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine helicopter was on a resupply mission for troops
attempting to search for and destroy remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda
forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Stallions have been used extensively to move troops,
food and gear to far-flung spots in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>Turf War Blamed for Indian Trust Problems</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Bureaucratic mistrust and infighting stymied efforts to improve the
Interior Department's management of royalties from Native American
lands, an internal investigation found.</LD>
<LD>   The report, by the Interior Department's inspector general, said
the turf wars led to false information being given to Congress and a
judge in a lawsuit over the mismanaged Indian money. The
mismanagement also led to the destruction of e-mails that should have
been saved as potential evidence, the report says.</LD>
<LD>   The inspector general said, in a report filed with the court late
Monday, that any misdeeds were unintentional, because the department
is so "blinded by clouded judgment and crippled by distrust, a
singular sinister or conspiratorial plan is impossible to construct."</LD>
<TE>   The department has been ordered by U.S. District Judge Royce
Lamberth to fix its management of 11 million acres of Indian land
entrusted to the department.</TE>
<TE>   Interior oversees oil, gas, coal, timber, grazing and other
royalties from the lands. Proceeds are supposed to be paid to the
Indian landowners, but Native Americans who sued the department in
1996 claim mismanagement has cost 300,000 Indian landowners more than
$10 billion. The lawsuit has contributed to problems, the inspector
general said, angering employees so much that "they cannot see or
think clearly to make a correct decision. Every effort is thwarted by
internal discord, distrust and a dysfunctional reluctance to assume
ownership."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, a court-appointed watchdog filed a series of scathing
reports, chastising Interior for misleading the court about the
progress of trust reform and failing to inform the judge that a key
accounting system was a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Solicitor William G. Myers III asked the inspector
general to investigate the claims.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general said the investigation was hampered by the
refusal of key officials from the Clinton administration--including
former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, his chief of staff and
others--to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that employees have repeatedly sought to protect
their bureaus first, then the department as a whole and, lastly, the
Indian landowners.</TE>

<HD>Court Hears Debate About Placing Washington Mayor on
Primary Ballot</HD>
<DH>Politics: Elections board had found signatures for Anthony
Williams were fraudulent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The District of Columbia's Court of Appeals heard oral arguments
Tuesday in a case that could keep Washington Mayor Anthony Williams
off the Democratic primary ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel peppered both sides with questions and
promised a ruling "in reasonable dispatch."</LD>
<LD>   The case involves a decision by the D.C. Board of Elections and
Ethics to reject Williams' reelection petitions as being tainted by
fraud. Needing 2,000 signatures to qualify for the Sept. 10 primary
ballot, the Williams campaign turned in petitions containing 10,102.
But many were clearly fraudulent--the names included U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and actor Kelsey Grammer, neither of whom is a
registered voter in Washington--while other signatures appeared to be
forgeries, written on page after page in the same handwriting.</LD>
<TE>   The city's registrar of voters determined that 2,235 of the
signatures were valid, but the board overturned that ruling. If
upheld, the board's decision means that the first-term mayor--hailed
as a reformer when he came to office four years ago, replacing the
combative Marion Barry--would have to launch a write-in campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In its questions, the court seemed generally supportive of the
board. Judge Eric T. Washington, for instance, noted that in a city
more than 80% Democratic, it is hard to imagine collecting petitions
with an 80% error rate. He asked the mayor's lawyers whether that
fact alone would not justify the board's decision to throw out the
petitions.</TE>
<TE>   But attorney Vincent Mark J. Policy argued that if the board was
throwing out the petitions because they were fraudulent, it first had
to allow the mayor's camp to rebut the claim. The board subpoenaed a
Williams aide, Scott Bishop, who was in charge of collecting the
petition signatures, but he refused to testify, claiming a 5th
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The line of questioning led to courtroom speculation that the
court, which reviews decisions by city administrative agencies, could
return the case to the Board of Elections and Ethics for further
consideration. The board separately held hearings Tuesday on whether
to recommend that the U.S. attorney prosecute the petition
circulators for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The court battle is holding up the printing of the primary
ballots, which were supposed to have been sent Tuesday to absentee
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman Benjamin Wilson said outside the courthouse he
wants to delay printing the ballots "until we have a final decision."</TE>

<HD>Mennonites Mourn 3 Sisters' Deaths</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: A Wisconsin community gathers after the children
are found dead inside a cedar chest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITY, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Horse-drawn buggies, black vans and trucks with their chrome bumpers
and hubcaps painted black were parked in the gravel driveway of the
Oberholtzer farm on Tuesday. Men and boys in dark suits and white
shirts gathered on the front lawn, comforting the family.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths of three young sisters who suffocated after they
apparently locked themselves in a homemade cedar chest while playing
have drawn their tightknit Mennonite community together.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like a shock wave," said Luke Weaver, a family friend.
"When you have deaths like this, a community's plans, a family's
plans, everyone's plans change immediately."</LD>
<TE>   Two-year-old Anne, 4-year-old Darlene and 6-year-old Karla, who
died Monday, were "full of life, giggly, happy, normal little girls,"
Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother, Shirley Oberholtzer, and two older daughters had
been canning on their farm near Unity, about 130 miles northwest of
Madison, said Sheriff Louis J. Rosandich. The mother noticed the
girls were missing and found them inside the chest--about 3 feet long
and 2 feet deep--in an upstairs bedroom. They were not breathing.</TE>
<TE>   The first sheriff's deputy to arrive instructed the girls' mother
on how to perform CPR, but the two were unable to revive the
children, Rosandich said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see the shock," said the sheriff, who arrived at the
farm after the girls were taken to the hospital, where they were
pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   Rosandich said he was unsure how long the girls were trapped
inside the chest, which could only be opened from the outside once it
latched.</TE>
<TE>   News of the deaths spread quickly through the Mennonite community
of about 350 families. Church members gathered at the Oberholtzers'
neat, white farmhouse to mourn with the family.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Virus Mounts Deadly Attack in Louisiana</HD>
<DH>Disease: The sick toll rises to 71, including 5 deaths, in
the worst U.S. outbreak since 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART and MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MANDEVILLE, La.</DL>
<LD>As dusk fell on St. Tammany Parish, Sam Costanza cast a line for
croaker from the banks of Lake Pontchartrain--and counted on an
occasional breeze to keep the mosquitoes at bay.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't tell which mosquitoes are infected with West Nile," he
said, flicking away the bugs that hovered near his bare arms. "But
you can't run away from them, either. When you're around mosquitoes
as much as we are, you learn to take your chances."</LD>
<LD>   But as an insect-borne epidemic worsens, the nonchalance of
residents like Costanza has health officials on edge. A 76-year-old
woman became the fifth Louisiana resident to die of West Nile virus,
the state's epidemiologist said Tuesday, and 14 more people have
fallen ill across the state.</LD>
<TE>   The fresh cases bring Louisiana's sick toll to 71 and make this
the worst outbreak of West Nile since the disease came to the United
States three years ago. This summer, the Southern rite of bug bites
can be a deadly affliction--and the virus shows no sign of abating.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only the beginning," Louisiana epidemiologist Raoult
Ratard said. "It won't be surprising if we get 200 or 300 cases
before it's over."</TE>
<TE>   West Nile virus is carried by migratory birds and spread by
mosquitoes. Mississippi has confirmed 22 cases of the disease this
year. Texas health officials suspect they've had 10 residents fall
ill with the virus. And earlier this week, another suspected West
Nile victim turned up in Arkansas, near the Louisiana line. The virus
is expected to spread to California this year or next.</TE>
<TE>   East Baton Rouge Parish has lost two people to the disease. A
resident of Calcasieu Parish, near the Texas border, died of West
Nile virus. Here in St. Tammany Parish, across the watery stretch of
Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, two people have died, and 18
more were infected.</TE>
<TE>   Even 8-year-old Jocelyn Rojas knows those numbers by heart--along
with the warning that this year's mosquitoes "have a disease." Before
she and her brothers step into the afternoon to walk the family dog
along their heavily wooded street, they slather every inch of exposed
skin with insect repellent. Nevertheless, the kids end up swatting
bugs from their legs.</TE>
<TE>   "You protect yourself with bug spray as best you can," said their
36-year-old father, Eric Rojas. "We don't stay out very long, just
long enough to get in a short walk after work. When we go back to the
house, we won't come out until morning. We don't take unnecessary
risks, but you have to live your life."</TE>
<TE>   When darkness falls, the mosquito trucks come rumbling through the
streets, yellow lights flashing, to spray a fine mist of pesticides
over the lawns. From dusk to midnight, low-flying planes blanket the
910-square-mile parish with bug poison.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, it stinks," said Jennifer Bonnell, 26. "You hate to think
what's in the stuff. But I think it's working. I'm not noticing as
many mosquitoes out there."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't enough to save Steven Theall, a former jockey who died
last month of the virus. Weakened by emphysema, the 53-year-old
Theall spent his days among the puddles and manure of a horse stable
in nearby Folsom. "That's probably where that mosquito came from,"
said his father, Edgar Theall.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, the elder Theall watched his son waste away. Steven
thought he'd caught a bad case of the flu. He'd knock it out with
Coke and aspirin, he told his father.</TE>
<TE>   "But he didn't get any better," Edgar Theall said. "He just got
worse. The boy was in real misery. He got weaker and weaker."</TE>
<TE>   By the time a friend drove Theall to the hospital, it was too
late. The onetime athlete spent five weeks in intensive care. By the
time he died July 26, his frame had dwindled from 106 to 70 pounds.
"His immune system was so weak that he couldn't recover," his father
said.</TE>
<TE>   At its worst, West Nile can bring on encephalitis, a fatal
swelling of the brain. Most of the victims killed in Louisiana were
elderly people whose immune systems were weakened by other health
problems, said Charlie Anderson, Louisiana's West Nile virus
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   But more often than not, the virus is a relatively mild malady.
Most of those stricken with West Nile don't get sick at all, or they
suffer flu-like symptoms. The improbability of a serious infection
has fueled a cavalier outlook among many residents, said Dawn Wesson,
a mosquito specialist at Tulane University Health Sciences Center in
New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the attitude that we've always had mosquitoes and they're
not going to make me sick anyway," she said. "But you wouldn't want
to be the one who gets sick. It's not worth the gamble."</TE>
<TE>   Until this summer's outbreak, the worst epidemic was the United
States' first brush with the disease, when 62 residents of New York
state fell ill in 1999. Seven people died that summer.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana's West Nile epidemic is most likely a function of its
geography. This swamp state of lush greenery and stagnant waters
makes for a buggy pit stop in the path of migrating birds. The virus
is carried from one state to the next by birds, then transmitted by
mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the things that make our state so beautiful also supports
mosquito development," Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is to find a balance between caution and common sense,
said Susan Costanza, who wore a sleeveless sundress as she fished
alongside her husband. When mosquito larvae speckled her
grandchildren's plastic swimming pool, Costanza dumped out the water
and packed away the pool for the rest of the summer. When bugs
swarmed a neighbor's water-filled tire swing, she called the city to
complain.</TE>
<TE>   Costanza pointed a fish hook in the direction of the couple's
pickup. Inside, the pair keep a duffel bag stuffed with emergency
supplies: bug spray, long-sleeved shirts and slow-burning coils of
repellant.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless it gets like the plague or something, I'm not going to let
myself get paranoid," she said. "But I want to be safe just in case."</TE>
<TE>   But beneath the towering pines, tallows and stately oaks of
Mandeville's sleepy streets, fear of mosquitoes is still evident.
Flowerpots and wheelbarrows are overturned in the grass--officials
have urged residents to throw out standing water where mosquitoes
breed.</TE>
<TE>   Having spent one sweltering summer after the next in Mandeville,
Bonnell never gave the prick of a mosquito a second thought. "You
just whack at it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not this year. These days, Bonnell is arming herself with
citronella candles and bug spray.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I'm paranoid now," she said. "It's scary
to think a little mosquito bite could kill you."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The daughters of former President Nixon met Tuesday in an attempt to
resolve their two-year dispute over how to spend a $20-million
bequest for their father's presidential library.</LD>
<LD>   No agreement was reached in the daylong, court-ordered meeting,
but at midday a longtime friend of the late president was optimistic.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hopeful," said Robert Abplanalp, who must decide with Tricia
Cox and Julie Eisenhower how the gift is spent.</LD>
<TE>   In June, a judge ordered the daughters to meet with Abplanalp,
estate trustees and representatives of the Nixon Library and
Birthplace facility in Yorba Linda, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon's friend, banker Charles "Bebe" Rebozo, left 65% of his
estate to the library when he died in 1998 on the condition that the
sisters and Abplanalp approve the spending.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters can't agree whether the library should be run by the
family, Cox's choice, or by a 24-member board, the preference of
Eisenhower and the library foundation.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>Planned Parenthood will not have to turn over pregnancy test records
to Buena Vista County authorities under a temporary stay granted
Tuesday by the Iowa Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The county wants the information for an investigation into a dead
baby boy found at a recycling center in May. Authorities had asked
Planned Parenthood's Storm Lake clinic for the names and addresses of
women who had a positive pregnancy test between Aug. 15, 2001, and
May 30, 2002.</LD>
<LD>   District Judge Frank Nelson had ordered the information be turned
over by Aug. 17, but the stay effectively freezes the compliance
date.</LD>
<TE>   Planned Parenthood filed its motion and a petition for an appeal
Friday, arguing that the information is private medical information
that cannot be released without consent.</TE>
<TE>   "This really pulls the fuse out of the situation," Planned
Parenthood director Jill June said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court set a deadline of Aug. 19 to file a
written response to the appeal petition. Buena Vista County Atty.
Phil Havens said he needed to review the court documents before he
does anything.</TE>
<TE>   Medical records are confidential under Iowa law. But Havens has
argued that the files are not medical records because the staff who
provided pregnancy tests are not required to be doctors or nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say the records would help them find the mother of
the baby--believed to be 24 to 48 hours old--whose body was found May
30.</TE>

<HD>Maryland to Poison Pond to Kill Snakehead Fish</HD>
<DH>Environment: Officials choose the method over draining or
electroshock to eradicate the predator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Maryland's Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday that it would
use poison to kill the land-crawling snakehead fish found in a local
pond to stop the predator from spreading into the state's waterways.</LD>
<LD>   The snakehead, a native of China that grows up to 3 feet long and
can crawl across land, was discovered this summer by a fisherman in a
pond in Crofton, Md., raising fears that it could devastate local
fish populations.</LD>
<LD>   State officials said they would adopt the recent recommendations
of a scientific panel to use herbicides and the pesticide Rotenone to
kill the snakeheads as well as the other fish in the pond.</LD>
<TE>   That means the state later this week will first spray herbicides
to destroy plants in the pond that could hide and protect the
snakeheads. The chemicals will cause oxygen levels to drop, and the
fish should die, the department said.</TE>
<TE>   One to two weeks after the herbicides are applied, Rotenone will
be added to eliminate any remaining fish.</TE>
<TE>   An alternative plan to drain the pond would have risked allowing
baby snakeheads to escape in the water pumped into a river, officials
said. Other options, such as large-scale netting or electroshocking
the water, were also rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has proposed banning imports and trade
across state lines of snakeheads. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton
called the fish something from "a bad horror movie."</TE>
<TE>   Two snakeheads, which have been nicknamed "Frankenfish," were
dumped in the Maryland pond by a resident who bought them from a live
fish market to make soup.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 baby snakeheads were later found in the pond.</TE>
<TE>   The species has been imported from China to the U.S. by seafood
sellers and aquarium shops.</TE>

<HD>Blue Jays Hold Off Mariners in Slugfest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Toronto Blue Jays didn't expect to eke out a victory after
scoring 14 runs.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Orlando Hudson homered and had a career-high four hits, and
the Blue Jays built an 11-run lead, then hung on to beat the Seattle
Mariners, 14-12, Tuesday night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a nice cushion. Maybe we got a little lackadaisical,"
Toronto starter Roy Halladay said. "Fortunately, we had enough runs
to win."</LD>
<TE>   Hudson went four for four with a walk and two runs batted in, and
the Blue Jays had a season-high 20 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Stewart and Eric Hinske each went four for five, and
Stewart and Hinske hit consecutive triples in a six-run sixth. Rookie
Josh Phelps homered and had three RBIs for the Blue Jays, who have
won three in a row and six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   "The lead was just too big," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 13-2 in the eighth, the Mariners got six runs on
Jeff Cirillo's run-scoring single, Mark McLemore's two-run double and
John Olerud's three-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle scored four runs with two out in the ninth on Charles
Gipson's two-run single and Olerud's run-scoring single against Cliff
Politte, and Edgar Martinez's run-scoring infield single against
Kelvim Escobar. With two on, Escobar struck out pinch-hitter Ruben
Sierra for his 22nd save in 28 chances.</TE>
<TE>   "When momentum shifts like that it's tough to stop," Hinske said.
"They got a couple of runs, than a couple of more and all of a sudden
it's 14-11."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 9, Boston 1--Ramon Hernandez hit a three-run homer, and
Olmedo Saenz hit a two-run shot at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada's hitting streak ended at 24 games, but the A's won
for the fifth time in six tries to move within one game of the Red
Sox in the American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 9, Minnesota 2--Luis Lopez's second career grand slam
highlighted a six-run seventh inning at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles sent 10 batters to the plate in the inning. It was
Lopez's first homer this season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's David Ortiz had two hits, including a two-run homer,
to extend his career-high hitting streak to 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, New York 2--Raul Ibanez had four hits and two runs
batted in at New York to end his hitless stretch at 15 at-bats, and
the Royals pounded Mike Mussina for a career-worst 14 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Chuck Knoblauch had two hits and sparked a three-run
third inning in his first game at Yankee Stadium since leaving New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Mussina (13-6) left after giving up five runs in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 8, Texas 2--Steve Sparks struck out eight in his third
complete game this season, and Carlos Pena hit a three-run homer at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Halter hit a solo homer for the Tigers, who won for only the
second time in 10 games and ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks (6-11) gave up seven hits and walked one in his 16th career
complete game. It was the second victory in three starts for the
knuckleballer.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Tampa Bay 2--Charles Nagy won at Jacobs Field for the
first time in more than a year, and Jim Thome hit his 33rd home run.</TE>
<TE>   Nagy (1-2), who has pitched the last two years without any
cartilage in his right elbow, gave up two runs and six hits in seven
innings for his first home victory since July 21, 2001. After giving
up two runs in the first inning, Nagy used his sinker and curve to
retire 18 of 21.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Strike Won't Be a Big Deal to Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>If a player strike results in the cancellation of the playoffs and
deprives the Angels of the chance for their first postseason
appearance in 16 years, so be it.</LD>
<LD>   So say the Angel players, after a briefing Tuesday by their union
representative, pitcher Scott Schoeneweis.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we're having a great year, and it would be unfortunate
if some or all of that was lost," Schoeneweis said. "But I feel
pretty vehement about the issues. These things have to be resolved."</LD>
<TE>   Said infielder Scott Spiezio: "Nobody wants the season to end. But
we're pretty strong in our feelings, and we'll stick together."</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis said "the owners are well aware" that players could
set a strike date Monday in the absence of substantial negotiating
progress before then. The players will submit a steroid testing
proposal today, he said, but the thornier issues of revenue sharing
and a luxury tax will not be solved by an agreement on steroid
testing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it has any bearing for or against us getting a
deal done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins appears to be the only party interested in buying
the Angels now. But a labor agreement would ensure that revenues flow
uninterrupted for several years, so suitors not interested in buying
into a sport on the verge of a work stoppage could swoop in once
players and owners reach a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins acknowledges that his best chance to buy the team is now.
Despite industry skepticism that he might never reach a deal if he
has not done so after six months of discussions with Disney, the
Alabama businessman insists his pursuit has not lost momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm putting a great deal of effort into getting a deal done prior
to the resolution of labor issues," Watkins said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is to my benefit to try to get a deal done before a
work stoppage, if there is one. I work hard at this every day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Angels signed first baseman Casey Kotchman to a
$2.075-million signing bonus, the second-largest in club history
behind Troy Glaus' $2.25-million bonus in 1997, but wrist injuries
have cut short each of his first two minor league seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he played 11 games. This year, he played 74, hitting
.292 with four home runs at Class-A Cedar Rapids. The 19-year-old
hopes to rejoin the team for the Midwest League playoffs, but the
Angels do not expect him to return before spring training. General
Manager Bill Stoneman called the injuries "freak things"--Kotchman
injured his left wrist while sliding this year--and said the Angels
are pleased with his performance.</TE>

<HD>Strike Date Could Be Set on Monday</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball's union could set a strike date Monday when its executive
board meets in Chicago to evaluate the progress of labor talks.</LD>
<LD>   The board held a telephone conference call Tuesday to discuss
negotiations, where slow-but-steady progress is being made. It also
prepared a response today to the owners' proposal for mandatory drug
testing.</LD>
<LD>   Players seem reluctant to set a deadline that could trigger
baseball's ninth work stoppage since 1972. But depending on
negotiations the rest of this week, a strike date could be set at the
Chicago meeting, according to two lawyers familiar with the union's
deliberations, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to believe that we're going to get anything done
without having a deadline," National League player representative Tom
Glavine said. "It's almost like the threat of a strike date has kind
of become the deadline of this thing. If that spurs things on,
great."</TE>
<TE>   On the drug issue, it appears players will agree to some level of
tests for steroids and performance-enhancing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine said players want to prove "our sport is clean and if it's
not, we'll do something to clean it up."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball has been without a drug agreement since 1985. Owners have
proposed testing all players three times a year for
performance-enhancing drugs and once a year for illegal drugs such as
cocaine and marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for players and owners met twice Tuesday, spending
most of their time discussing the owners' proposals for debt
regulation and new rules regarding the funding of deferred
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland completed the July 19 trade that sent pitcher Chuck
Finley to St. Louis, acquiring switch-hitting outfielder Covelli
Crisp from the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians continued to shuffle players, sending pitcher Jaret
Wright to the minors and recalling outfielder Karim Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Crisp, 22, was the Cardinals' minor league player of the year in
2001. He was batting .301 with nine homers and 47 runs batted in at
double-A New Haven.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, 26, who has had two shoulder surgeries in the last three
years, was 0-2 with a 16.62 earned-run average.</TE>

<TE>   Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth was put on the 15-day disabled list

<LD>Around Detroit, a frequent topic of conversation has been the huge
painting of Barry Sanders that was finally removed from the side of
downtown's Cadillac Tower Building last month. A mural of the Stanley
Cup, which is a tribute to the Red Wings' recent title, has replaced
Sanders' picture.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Parker of the Detroit News said it was time for a change:
"There's no reason to immortalize Sanders. None. Zero. Zip.... In the
big picture, Sanders' run in Motown, which ended abruptly three years
ago when he quit on the eve of training camp, wound up being empty.
What started out as a chance for true greatness--not only for him,
but for this football-crazed city--came up short. It would be one
thing if Sanders had left behind a Super Bowl championship. Or exited
the NFL as the career-leading rusher. Those are reasons to remember
someone forever.</LD>
<LD>   "Instead, Sanders helped the Lions to just one playoff victory."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the only two athletes to win Olympic medals
and be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame?</TE>

<TE>   Sharpen your skates: San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott
Ostler takes aim at the latest figure skating scandal:</TE>
<TE>   "* Alleged ice-dance fixer Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov is also known by
his mafia nickname, Salchow Breath. Or you can just call him
Skateless Joe.</TE>
<TE>   "* Laugh if you will at that Russian mobster fixing ice dancing.
But I hear he was armed, and his gun had sequin-piercing bullets."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just walk, baby: After the Oakland Raiders had gathered for their
annual meeting with league officials on rule changes, virtually the
entire team walked out in protest of its controversial playoff defeat
against the New England Patriots in last season's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Celtic pride: Michael Holley of the Boston Globe, on the Celtics'
acquisition of Vin Baker in a five-player trade with Seattle: "NBA
general managers mete out more second and third chances than any
other executives in America, and they are often attracted to 6-11
forwards who used to be All-Stars.... [But] I don't understand why
the Celtics have to pay someone more than $12 million per season to
fill that job description. By 2006, the Celtics will have paid Baker
more than $50 million, or more than twice as much as Rodney Rogers
would have commanded in a four-year contract. And this is [Boston
owner Paul] Gaston's idea of saving money?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1999, Wade Boggs of Tampa Bay became
the first player to homer for his 3,000th hit, during a 15-10 loss to
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jim Thorpe, a charter member of the Hall of Fame
and a gold-medal winner in the decathlon and pentathlon at the 1912
Stockholm Olympics, and Ollie Matson, a 1972 Hall of Fame inductee
who won a gold medal in the 1,600-meter relay and a bronze in the 440
meters at the 1952 Helsinki Games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: After Polish 7-foot-2 center Cezary Trybanski signed
a three-year, $4.8-million free-agent deal with the Memphis
Grizzlies, General Manager Jerry West said that he wanted to make him
another pet project the way he did with Vlade Divac and the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to prove that Jerry West is right," Trybanski said. "I
want to play like a Vlade."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Ted Williams: The Pursuit of Perfection"</LD>
<LD>   Authors: Jim Prime and Bill Nowlin</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sports Publishing L.L.C.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $39.95</TE>
<TE>   Besides the stories and photos of Ted Williams in this 256-page
coffee-table book, there is an audio CD that includes actual calls,
reactions and interviews with Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The stories for the book were culled from various sources, some
written by big names in sports, others by ordinary people whose lives
were touched by Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stories are surprising. There's one from a fan, a
college professor in Wisconsin, who wrote to Williams in 1982.
Williams not only wrote back but met with the fan and his 5-year-old
son at the Red Sox's training camp in New Haven, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Garagiola writes about being a rookie catcher for the St.
Louis Cardinals and going four for four with three runs batted in in
a 12-3 victory over the Red Sox in Game 4 of the 1946 World Series,
then picking up a Boston newspaper the next day and reading the
headline "WILLIAMS BUNTS!"</TE>
<TE>   Among the more than 100 contributors are such baseball people as
Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, George Steinbrenner and onetime Red Sox
announcer Curt Gowdy. But maybe the best story of all comes from Bob
Knight, who writes about going fishing with Williams in Russia in
1991 for the ESPN show, "The Fishin' Hole."</TE>
<TE>   Knight, at one point, says he and Williams "might be the two most
temperamental guys in sports history."</TE>
<TE>   Knight also writes about what he calls "one of the neatest things
that's ever happened to me in my lifetime." He, Williams and a
cameraman are on an airplane and Knight apparently is asleep. But he
can hear the cameraman ask Williams, "What's Coach Knight like?"</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>They Don't Take Shuey Bait</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Shuey loves to fish, but the new Dodger reliever has discovered,
much to his frustration, that many National League hitters do not
share his passion.</LD>
<LD>   The result has been a rocky transition from the American League to
the NL after a July 28 trade from Cleveland--a 9.64 earned-run
average, one blown save and a loss in his first six games as a
Dodger, including Monday's meltdown, when he gave up three runs in
the eighth inning of a 7-5 loss to Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "They're not as big a fish in the National League," Shuey said.
"In the American League, you throw something over the plate, someone
is gonna take a big hack and try to hit a home run. Here, they're
more patient. I've had guys with two strikes, and they keep fouling
pitches off. [Former Indian reliever] Steve Karsay warned me about
that. Maybe I didn't believe him, but [NL hitters] have made a
believer of me now."</LD>
<TE>   Fatigue has been a factor in Shuey's struggles. After pitching
three days in a row only once this year, once in 2001 and once in
2000, Shuey has pitched three consecutive days twice in his first
week as a Dodger. He said he was "gassed" after Monday's game, and
Manager Jim Tracy didn't use the right-hander Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   But Shuey, who relies on a 95-mph fastball, nasty split-fingered
fastball and curve, said his struggles have also forced him to
re-evaluate his pitching style.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to take a hard look at how you pitch different here than
in the AL," Shuey said. "If they're more patient, they'll be later on
the fastball, which may make that a better pitch.... This team is a
great group of guys, [catcher Paul] Lo Duca has been fantastic, easy
to work with. I need to get my end of the deal working."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a light bullpen session today, Kevin Brown hopes to throw
between 80-90 pitches for triple-A Las Vegas in his second
rehabilitation start Friday night. If all goes well, the
right-hander, who underwent surgery for a herniated disk in his lower
back June 11, will likely start next week in Montreal or New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers haven't decided who will be bumped from the rotation
when Brown is activated, but with Omar Daal giving up only six earned
runs in 19 1/3 innings of his last three starts and Kazuhisa Ishii
struggling, there's a good chance Ishii could be demoted to the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Though Ishii's control problems wouldn't seem to suggest success
in the bullpen, where throwing strikes is a priority, some in the
organization believe Ishii could develop more rhythm and perhaps
better control with more work instead of one start every five days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A week after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee,
pitcher Darren Dreifort has regained almost full range of motion in
the knee, and most of the swelling has dissipated. The right-hander,
who has been rehabilitating his surgically repaired elbow for six
months, will begin playing catch on flat ground later this week, but
his chances of pitching this season are slim.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to stabilize the knee and re-start his throwing program,"
said Pat Screnar, Dodger physical therapist. "Whether we have enough
time to do that and get some rehab games in ... it's going to be
difficult."</TE>

<HD>USGA, R&amp;A Change Driver 'Spring' Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long and often bitter debate about setting technological limits
on golf clubs took an unexpected turn Tuesday when the game's ruling
bodies reversed their positions and scaled back what they previously
had decided to allow.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Golf Assn. and the Royal and Ancient announced an
agreement to set the coefficient of restitution (COR)--the measure of
the springlike effect of golf balls struck by drivers--at .830
beginning in 2003 in the United States and at the British Open.</LD>
<LD>   When the USGA and the R&amp;A announced a joint proposal May 9 to set
COR limits on the advanced drivers, a higher .860 COR standard was
established for amateur golfers, with the .830 limit applying to
"highly skilled golfers," or the professionals. Under the proposal,
the higher COR standard for amateurs would have been in force until
2008, when the COR limit would have been lowered to .830.</LD>
<TE>   Golf club manufacturing heavyweights Callaway Golf and TaylorMade
heralded the plan at the time because they would be permitted to
market and sell drivers conforming to the official, higher limits
until 2008. Three months later, the clubmakers found that permission
rescinded.</TE>
<TE>   According to the USGA, the decision to set the lower limit of .830
and abandon the May 9 proposal of .860 was made in order to placate
the clubmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was simply that people, manufacturers ... thought that going
up and back down was too disruptive in the marketplace," said Reed
MacKenzie, president of the USGA.</TE>
<TE>   However, a spokesman for Callaway Golf took issue with such a
rationale.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who says it was done for the benefit of the manufacturers
obviously didn't talk to anybody at the largest golf club
manufacturer in the world," said Larry Dorman, a vice president at
Callaway.</TE>
<TE>   Chip Brewer, chief executive officer of Adams Golf, was similarly
perplexed.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, we were surprised by the USGA's announcement," he said.
"Does the golfer win? I don't know the answer. Does the industry win?
I think the answer is probably no, but I also do not believe
protecting the industry is the USGA's job."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman at TaylorMade Golf says the company will have no
comment until Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Drapeau, Callaway's president and chief executive officer,
called the USGA's moves "rigid" and "arbitrary."</TE>
<TE>   The .830 COR limit on driving clubs affects amateurs who post
scores for handicap purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the R&amp;A will not institute the .830 limit until 2008,
although "highly skilled players" must adhere to the limit in 2003,
which affects the British Open.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over the thin-faced drivers has raged since 1998, when
the USGA imposed its .830 limit while the R&amp;A set no limit on the
springlike effect of the clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The USGA is the governing body for golf in the U.S., Canada and
parts of South America; the R&amp;A sets the standards for the rest of
the world.</TE>

<HD>Now They See Bid Picture</HD>
<DH>Auction: Hearn items weren't doing much business on EBay
until the last few days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing--not even Chick Hearn's death--is so sacred people won't try
to make a buck off it.</LD>
<LD>   The EBay auction site has experienced a surge in Hearn-related
items since the longtime Laker announcer died Monday of complications
from a head injury he suffered in a fall last week at his Encino
home. Not surprisingly, the asking and selling prices of those items
have soared.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, about the time news of his first brain surgery became
public, four items connected to Hearn were up for bid on the Internet
auction service. By Sunday, as Hearn fought for his life after a
second operation, the number of items for sale had climbed into the
70s.</LD>
<TE>   By Tuesday afternoon, not even 24 hours after his death, the
number of items for sale--bobble-head dolls, autographed basketballs,
autographed Hollywood Walk of Fame cards and other memorabilia--had
risen to 183.</TE>
<TE>   The same type of bobble-head doll that sold for $17.90 on July
28--before Hearn's fall and subsequent death--went for $125 on Monday
and was selling for more than $150 on Tuesday. For most, the bidding
had reached about $75, a tidy profit for an item that was given away
to fans during the Lakers' spring playoff series against San Antonio
and later sold for $30 at Staples Center souvenir stands.</TE>
<TE>   Three souvenir placards, distributed to fans at Staples Center on
April 9 to celebrate Hearn's return to the broadcast booth after
heart and hip surgery, drew little interest before he died, getting
one bid each before selling for $9.99 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after Hearn's death, an identical item got 23 bids and sold
for $46.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-inch vinyl rap record Hearn recorded in 1986 drew no bids at
a starting price of $24.99 when it was originally put up for sale in
an auction that ended July 28. It was listed again and drew 16 bids
before it sold for $61 Monday. An autographed photo of Hearn sold for
$1 on July 29; an autographed index card, without a photo, had hit
$18 Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, no doubt, would have laughed.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel, a winner of four stakes the first two weeks of
Saratoga, will try for his second victory of the Del Mar season in
this afternoon's $75,000 Escondido Handicap.</LD>
<LD>   A prep for the $250,000 Del Mar Handicap on Sept. 1, the
Escondido, run at 1 3/8 miles on the turf, attracted only six
entrants, and the two horses who figure to get the most attention are
trained by Frankel.</LD>
<LD>   Lord Flasheart, the 7-5 morning-line choice, will be looking for
his second U.S. win in his fifth race in this country for owner Ed
Gann, who teamed with Frankel to win Sunday's Jim Dandy Stakes at
Saratoga in a runaway with Medaglia d'Oro.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-year-old, who was third by a neck as the 17-10 favorite in
last month's Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park, will have to beat 3-1
third choice Dance Dreamer.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Juddmonte Farms, Dance Dreamer, a 4-year-old son
of Nureyev, has won two of three in the States but will be making his
first stakes appearance. It will also mark his first start in this
country beyond 1 1/8 miles, but he did win at a mile and a quarter in
France and was third at the Escondido distance in his career debut
May 17, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Windy's Halo, a 10-year-old, makes his first
start of the year in the fourth, a $12,500 claimer at 6 1/2 furlongs
against a field that includes Big Shakespeare, who has won three of
his last four.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Eddie Delahoussaye. He is right in the thick of the
jockeys' race with nine victories and won Sunday's $250,000 San Diego
Handicap with longshot Grey Memo.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Chance Rollins. The rider is one for 28 at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Warn Me Again in the
fifth, using A Touch Of Grey, Kinston, Kinetic Bend and Always Game
in the sixth, Dance Dreamer, Lord Flasheart and Little Ghazi in the
seventh and singling Bush Triumph in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/25. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10.80/$156.60. Total money bet: $206.</TE>

<HD>Doubleday: Selig, Wilpon 'in Cahoots'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A co-owner of the New York Mets accused baseball commissioner Bud
Selig of conspiring with a former Arthur Andersen accountant to
"manufacture phantom operating losses" in the sport's books.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson Doubleday, in papers filed Tuesday in federal court in New
York, said the commissioner's office was "in cahoots" with Fred
Wilpon, his co-owner, to put an artificially low value on the team.
Wilpon is attempting to buy out Doubleday under the provisions of an
agreement they made when they bought the team in 1986.</LD>
<LD>   "MLB orchestrated a sham process that not only mistreated
Doubleday and betrayed his trust; it actively favored Wilpon and
engineered a result that served MLB's other and conflicting
interests," Doubleday's lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, the 14 former limited partners of the Montreal Expos
sued Selig under federal racketeering laws, claiming he conspired to
dilute their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Selig isn't a defendant in the Doubleday suit, but he was accused
of trying to inflate losses as part of his strategy in labor talks
with the players' association. Selig claims the 30 teams had $232
million in operating losses last year and that the sport needs
widespread changes in its next contract, currently under negotiation.</TE>
<TE>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, called Doubleday's
accusations "nonsense and a complete fabrication."</TE>
<TE>   Union head Donald Fehr called the allegations "serious," but said
he would not make additional comments before reading the papers in
greater detail.</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon sued Doubleday last month to force him to accept a buyout
based on a $391-million evaluation made in April by Robert Starkey, a
former Arthur Andersen partner who left in 1999 to form his own
company. In June, Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of
justice for its work for Enron Corp. Starkey's work for Andersen was
related to sports teams, not Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Selig did not return a telephone call seeking comment, and Starkey
refused comment.</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon spokesman Richard Auletta called Doubleday's accusations
"unfounded" and "irresponsible."</TE>

<HD>Nets Get Mutombo for Van Horn, MacCulloch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Philadelphia 76ers traded 36-year-old center Dikembe Mutombo to
the New Jersey Nets on Tuesday for forward Keith Van Horn and center
Todd MacCulloch.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-foot-2 Mutombo led the NBA in rebounding in 1999-00 and
2000-01 but averaged only 8.8 points in Philadelphia's first-round
playoff loss to Boston in April. Mutombo, an 11-year veteran, led the
league in blocked shots in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96.</LD>
<LD>   "With the addition of Mutombo we have the potential to be one of
the best defensive teams in the NBA," Net President Rod Thorn said.
"To get a player of that ilk was something we felt we should do."</LD>
<TE>   The trade also will allow the Nets to move Richard Jefferson, who
is coming off an impressive rookie season, into the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of Van Horn, 26, gives Philadelphia another scorer
who can--at least in theory--take some of the offensive burden off
Allen Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   "Allen said he needed two guys to score with him," 76er Coach
Larry Brown said. "Now, if he's willing to take 20 shots instead of
30 shots per game, there will be lots of shots around for other
people with the potential to score."</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn averaged a career-low 14.8 points last season and was
conspicuously ineffective during several postseason games.</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch, 26, is coming off his best professional season,
averaging 9.7 points and 6.1 rebounds in 62 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA guard Earl Watson became a member of the Memphis
Grizzlies after the Seattle SuperSonics declined to match an offer
sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Watson signed the offer sheet July 19, and Seattle had 15 days to
match the offer.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Watson's deal will pay
more than $1.2 million in the first season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former University of San Diego Coach Hank Egan, who spent the last
seven years as an assistant coach with San Antonio, has accepted a
similar position with the Golden State Warriors.... A judge in Oregon
City, Ore., rejected two arguments by prosecutors trying to justify a
search of the home of Portland Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire in
which a large bag of marijuana was found. The decision could lead to
the dismissal of the case.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that could add weeks of legal wrangling to an already
complex case, a reputed Russian mobster charged with trying to fix
two Olympic figure skating events will fight extradition to the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov said "no" Tuesday when asked by a judge at
a closed hearing in Santa Maria Maggiore prison at Venice, Italy, if
he would consent to extradition.</LD>
<LD>   By refusing voluntary extradition, Tokhtakhounov is guaranteed a
lengthy series of legal procedures.</LD>
<TE>   "He said he's absolutely not guilty of having anything to do with
the Olympics," defense attorney Luca Saldarelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhounov was arrested on a United States criminal complaint,
filed in Manhattan federal court, that accused him of fixing the
results of the pairs and ice dancing competitions at the Salt Lake
City Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Italian police officials have described Tokhtakhounov as a
high-ranking member of a Moscow-based crime group known as the Sun
Brigade, and have released excerpts of wiretapped conversations they
say show Tokhtakhounov was involved in fixing the events.</TE>
<TE>   They say Tokhtakhounov might have contacted as many as six judges
to help secure a gold medal for Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze in the pairs competition in exchange for a victory by
the French ice dancing team of Marina Anissina, who is originally
from Russia, and Gwendal Peirzerat. Both teams won.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Piazza knows what it means to have his name mentioned with
Johnny Bench.</LD>
<LD>   Piazza hit his 327th home run as a catcher, tying Bench for
second-most at the position, and the New York Mets beat the Milwaukee
Brewers, 5-1, Tuesday night to end a five-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, to be in the same sentence as Johnny Bench, for a
catcher it's definitely an honor," Piazza said. "He's the barometer
by which all catchers are measured."</LD>
<TE>   Piazza's two-run homer in the first inning was his 23rd. The only
player to hit more career home runs as a catcher was Carlton Fisk,
with 351.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Astacio (11-4) pitched a three-hitter for his third complete
game and the 30th of his career. He struck out a season-high 10 and
walked three.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Arizona 3--Andruw Jones' home run with two out in the
13th inning at Phoenix was decisive. Jones hit Mike Koplove's first
pitch 414 feet into the second deck just inside the left-field foul
pole for his 24th home run.</TE>
<TE>   Curt Schilling failed for the second time to get his 19th victory,
allowing three runs and seven hits while striking out 11 in throwing
a season-high 131 pitches in 7 1/3 innings. But the Diamondbacks
rallied for two runs off John Smoltz in the ninth to force extra
innings. It was Smoltz's first blown save in 26 chances since May 29.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 10, St. Louis 1--Masato Yoshii pitched a seven-hitter to
win for the first time since April 16, and Jose Macias had four hits
to help hand host St. Louis its season-worst sixth consecutive
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshii (3-4) pitched his third career complete game. He struck out
four and walked none, giving up a run on a first-inning wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 2, Florida 0--Dave Mlicki won for the first time in eight
starts, and Lance Berkman drove in both runs at Houston. Mlicki
(4-7), who went on the disabled list May 26 with a strained muscle in
his left rib cage, hadn't won since April 27 at Atlanta. He gave up
five hits, struck out five and walked four in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Cincinnati 6--The Rockies' Denny Stark (7-2) continued
his effective pitching at Coors Field, giving up only one run and
three hits in six innings. In six starts this season in the
hitter-friendly ballpark at Denver, Stark is 5-0 with a 2.21 ERA.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Hits 599th Homer, Giants Win</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He also drives in four runs in 11-10 victory over
the Cubs.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds' 599th homer wasn't even the most exciting part of a wild
victory for the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds moved to the doorstep of the exclusive 600-homer club with
an early three-run shot, and the Giants scored three runs in the
eighth to beat the Chicago Cubs, 11-10, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds drove in four runs, and his 432-foot drive into right-center
field in the third inning moved him within one homer of joining Hank
Aaron, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays with 600.</LD>
<TE>   Robb Nen joined his own exclusive club by getting the final three
outs for his 300th save--though he made it as difficult as possible
on himself.</TE>
<TE>   Nen gave up a run in the ninth and was forced to get two outs with
the bases loaded, escaping to become the youngest player to record
300 saves at age 32.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was actually glad his 600th homer didn't come on the same
night as Nen's milestone.</TE>
<TE>   "That makes it a lot better," Bonds said. "So can I go now, and
let him have his night?"</TE>
<TE>   After Chicago rallied from two big early deficits to take a late
lead, San Francisco won it with an eighth-inning comeback--and a
frantic ninth-inning stand that included the ejection of Cub
shortstop Alex Gonzalez.</TE>

<DL>CANTON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Houston Texan safety Leomont Evans walked in the hospital Tuesday and
showed so much improvement that he was expected to return to Houston
and begin rehabilitation.</LD>
<LD>   Evans bruised his spinal cord in a collision during the Texans'
NFL debut in the Hall of Fame game Monday night and temporarily lost
feeling in his arms and legs.</LD>
<LD>   Texan physician Walter Lowe said Evans would remain in Aultman
Hospital in Canton overnight and return to Houston today.</LD>
<TE>   "He's doing great but is a little scared about the seriousness of
it," Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe declined to say if Evans would return to playing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't recall much about the conversations, other than the privilege
of having them.</LD>
<LD>   He would be sitting on the level of his assigned broadcasting
post, but several sections off to the side, and all by himself almost
two hours before another Laker game. An icon sitting alone, now isn't
that crazy?</LD>
<LD>   There was never any question, Chick Hearn was going to be there.
It took just a walk up the stairs from Staples Center court level, a
quick turn down the aisle to the left and there he would be--arms
outstretched, always with the warm and welcome greeting.</LD>
<TE>   He was happy to see you, imagine that, no matter who you were, his
face--pancake makeup already applied--lighting up like a grandfather
spotting his grandson.</TE>
<TE>   I don't ever remember him shaking hands. He'd take both of your
hands by the fingers, then flap them up and down, as if he'd just
struck it rich because you happened to stop by.</TE>
<TE>   Then he would pat the seat next to him, a sign of affection, and
insist you join him.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me," he would say, and the first question was always his,
making a meeting with a living legend as comfortable as sitting with
family on the living room couch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE PLAYED basketball at East Aurora High and, almost 50 years
later, I was covering basketball games at East Aurora High. It was an
Illinois connection.</TE>
<TE>   I lost money betting on harness races at Aurora Downs while dating
the wife-to-be, and it has been bothering me all day--I can't
remember the story he told me about that track. I know he would
remember what I said, which is just another one of those gifts he had
that set him apart.</TE>
<TE>   Every time we chatted, he wanted to know more about the prospects
of pro football again in Los Angeles, and he'd say how good it would
be for the city to have a team here again, and I'd tease him: "You
interested in broadcasting their games too?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no," he'd say with a glint in his eye that said, "Well,
maybe if someone asks ... "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE TALKED about Jim Murray in reverential tones, offered a history
lesson on Jim Healy and talked lovingly about Jerry West, a man, as
he said, driven away from the Lakers by his own inability to watch
the team he built play.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrible, terrible, a terrible thing," he'd say. "Great, great
man. Just great."</TE>
<TE>   He called me "kid," and I was 50 years old, and I loved him for
that.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again I asked. I wanted to know how he did it, road trip
after road trip in his 80s, and why would he continue to do it?</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," he'd say, and that would never be enough for me, so I
would prod and tease and demand more, and he'd laugh and shake his
head and say, "I just love it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RECALL talking to him about his championship rings, and where he
kept them. He was going to get another that night, but he spoke about
the one he would never wear, the one he had given to his son before
his son's death.</TE>
<TE>   I made mention of that in the newspaper the next day, but with no
help from my notes, because I had stopped writing as he talked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT WAS always the same; no matter what we discussed, he'd want to
know about the Bagger.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me," he'd say, while poking a playful jab at my shoulder,
"you really like the kid, don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   And I'd tell him something I would never tell you, or anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN HE returned to work last season after his medical hiatus, he
was brought to the Laker locker room. He had already given a news
conference in the Chick Hearn Media Room at Staples Center, and
anyone who has seen tape of that event knows the trademark, wonderful
way he could enter a room, hands out, a hand raised and pointed at a
familiar face, offering a personal greeting.</TE>
<TE>   In the Laker locker room that day he had a warm meeting with Kobe.
Then Shaq came up from behind and placed his hands over Chick's eyes.
Athlete to broadcaster, there is almost no bigger sign of affection
than such playfulness.</TE>
<TE>   He continued to make his way around the room, smiles for
everybody, Jim Hill from Channel 2 following with a camera crew. "I'm
so happy to see you all," he told everyone, and then spotting me, he
said, "Even you."</TE>
<TE>   What an honor to be standing in front of a one-man firing squad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY WOULDN'T be long, those sessions sitting together, maybe five
or 10 minutes, sometimes interrupted by someone else desiring an
audience, but usually coming to a close at 6 p.m.--the assigned time
to go downstairs and listen to Phil Jackson speak. In departing, I'd
make some crack about Phil and Jeanie Buss, or Phil speaking from on
high, and without being pulled into the mud, he'd wave goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't seem like much now in comparison to a lifetime of
memorable running commentary for so many others in the Los Angeles
area, who grew up with this marvelous entertainer. But I have those
five- to 10-minute conversations, a treasure when you consider the
e-mail that has poured in here from people touched by someone they
never even met.</TE>
<TE>   There were some people talking Monday about a tragedy, but Vin
Scully, as you might expect, chose words better befitting to describe
the end of this great ride.</TE>
<TE>   "Though we have lost a dear friend and a true broadcasting legend,
I would like to offer a prayer of thanksgiving for having been able
to enjoy his work for all these years."</TE>
<TE>   I'll be thankful for those five or 10 special minutes shared
before just another basketball game with Chick Hearn, a reminder, I
guess, that every moment really does count, which might very well be
the answer I could never get out of him.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chilean officials said Tuesday they would deal sternly with a referee
who kneed a player in the leg during a first division game Sunday and
then red-carded him for feigning injury.</LD>
<LD>   Gaston Castro, the head of the Chilean league's refereeing
committee, said referee Francisco Caamano could be suspended for as
many as 50 games based on his actions in the closing minutes of a
match between Temuco and Audax Italiano.</LD>
<LD>   "If it is proved to be an act of aggression, he will get an
exemplary punishment," Castro told Reuters.</LD>
<TE>   Caamano claims he was simply trying to protect himself, but TV
replays showed that the referee, surrounded by protesting Audax
Italiano players, kneed one of them in the leg. When the player,
Alejandro Carrasco, fell to the ground, Caamano gave him a second
yellow card and ejected him from the game.</TE>
<TE>   Caamano, 33, a physical education teacher, told reporters that
Carrasco had trodden on his foot, that he "felt threatened" and that
kneeing the player was "a reflex act."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had ejected Carrasco because the player pretended to
have been kneed in the groin.</TE>
<TE>   Audax Italiano won the game, 2-1, but that did not stop its coach,
Hernan Godoy, from knocking the cellular telephone out of the hands
of a radio reporter who tried to interview him. The reporter
responded by kicking the coach, only to be chased off the field by
the Audax Italiano players.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Recalls Team</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has risked the wrath of European
clubs by recalling all 23 players who won the 2002 World Cup for a
friendly game against Paraguay in Fortaleza, Brazil, on Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Scolari included AS Roma defender Emerson in the
squad of 24. Emerson, Brazil's captain, dislocated his shoulder in
the team's final training session before its first World Cup match
and missed the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The game will be Brazil's first since defeating Germany, 2-0, in
the World Cup final in Yokohama, Japan, on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen of the 24 players are with clubs in England, France,
Germany, Italy and Spain, where the 2002-2003 league seasons have
just begun or are about to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo Needs Escort</TE>
<TE>   Brazil World Cup star Ronaldo flew back to Italy from Rio de
Janeiro Tuesday and needed a police escort out of the airport in
Milan, where angry Inter Milan fans turned out to protest his
possible move to Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Inter Milan's owner, Massimo Moratti, again denied that
the striker is heading for Spain in a multimillion-dollar deal.</TE>
<TE>   "There is only one truth," Moratti said in Tuesday editions of
Corriere dello Sport. "Ronaldo belongs to Inter and will play with us
next year as well. That's that."</TE>
<TE>   Numan Retires</TE>
<TE>   Defender Arthur Numan, who played for the Netherlands in the 1994
and 1998 World Cups and in the 1996 and 2000 European Championships,
Tuesday announced his retirement from international soccer. Numan,
32, played 45 games for the Dutch team. He said he will concentrate
on his club career with Glasgow Rangers in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   On the Move</TE>
<TE>   The Italian Serie A club Perugia agreed to transfer South Korean
World Cup star Ahn Jung-Hwan to a team yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy on the Road</TE>
<TE>   Matt Reis will start in goal tonight at San Jose, where the Galaxy
takes on the rival Earthquakes in a U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal match.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy has eliminated the Earthquakes from the U.S. Open Cup
the last two years, winning, 10-9, on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw
last year, and beating them, 2-0, in 2000. The Galaxy advanced to the
quarterfinals with a 4-0 win at the A-League's Minnesota Thunder on
July 17, whereas the Earthquakes needed a 120th-minute golden goal
from forward Ariel Graziani to beat the A-League's Seattle Sounders.</TE>

<HD>Clijsters Not Upset After Losing to Srebotnik</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Fifth-seeded player says she is looking forward to
time off. Capriati, Davenport win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was difficult to tell the winner from the loser Tuesday after
Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia upset fifth-seeded Kim Clijsters of
Belgium, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, in the second round of the JPMorgan Chase
Open in Manhattan Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Srebotnik, of course, was delighted with the victory over a player
who reached the French Open final last year, calling it the best
result of her career.</LD>
<LD>   Clijsters, meanwhile, seemed almost grateful to be out of the
draw.</LD>
<TE>   After reaching the final at Stanford two weeks ago and the
quarterfinals at Carlsbad last week, she said she was a little
fatigued.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not nice to lose and of course you feel disappointed," said
Clijsters, who has been bothered by a nagging shoulder injury, "but I
think in the next few days I can practice a little bit and not do too
much. I won't have the pressure of going out to play. I'll have a few
days off.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll try to do well in the doubles, but then I'll rest for
Montreal [next week's WTA tour stop]. Also for the U.S. Open. You
don't want to play too much."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati, seeded second, seemed intent on limiting her
time on the court too, following Clijsters and Srebotnik onto the
hard-court surface and dispatching Emmanuelle Gagliardi of
Switzerland, 6-1, 6-2, in 56 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Making her Manhattan Beach debut, Capriati was dominant.</TE>
<TE>   "First time here so it was good to come out and play well, not
being familiar with the court," Capriati said. "I liked it. Good
crowd. Intimate, cozy atmosphere out there. And the fans were great
and the court was a good speed."</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Lindsay Davenport, a three-time winner in this event
and the defending champion, also found the court to her liking,
although she undoubtedly spent a lot more time on it than she had
hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing her comeback from January knee surgery, the three-time
Grand Slam event winner held off 83rd-ranked Elena Bovina of Russia,
6-2, 6-7 (3), 6-3, in the featured night match at the Manhattan
Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, a semifinalist the last two weeks in her first
tournaments since November, needed more than two hours to make it
through to the third round. Serving for the match in the second set,
she was broken by Bovina, who then won the tiebreaker too, but
Davenport regained control in the third set.</TE>
<TE>   Like Clijsters, Davenport said she could use a break. Her
surgically repaired right knee is fine, but she said she suffered a
pulled left groin last weekend and is bothered by a recurrence of
tendinitis in her left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible," she said. "I'm not going to lie. I have more
tape on my body than I ever have.... Just little things here and
there, the result of playing too much."</TE>
<TE>   Srebotnik and Clijsters had played only once since Srebotnik
(pronounced zree-BOT-nik) defeated the Belgian to win the Wimbledon
junior title four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since their 1998 meeting at the All England Club, Clijsters has
flourished while Srebotnik has floundered. In their only previous
meeting as professionals, Clijsters smoked the redheaded Slovenian,
6-1, 6-1, on a carpet in Luxembourg in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "She got support when she was younger," Srebotnik said of
Clijsters, an established top-10 player. "It was difficult for me in
Slovenia. Nobody really supported me financially. The tennis
association never really helped me."</TE>
<TE>   Srebotnik, 21, ended last season ranked 98th, with the modest aim
of breaking into the top 60 this year. But after reaching the final
in two tournaments (and winning on clay at Acapulco in March), she
has climbed to 43rd, the highest in her career, and is on the verge
of cracking the top 40.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't give myself any huge goals," she said. "I was just going
step by step. Whatever comes more, it's better. I'm so happy for
that."</TE>
<TE>   With more than $800,000 in tour winnings, she's on more solid
ground financially and, after failing for a long time to find a coach
compatible with her, she finally settled a year ago on countrywoman
Tina Krizan, who is also her doubles partner.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to prove to myself that I can beat these top
players if I play well, so that was what I was trying to do today,"
Srebotnik said. "I've played a lot of matches really tight against
top players but never really made it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good for my confidence."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Soon after I realized I wouldn't be Magic Johnson, I wanted to be
Chick Hearn.</LD>
<LD>   Chick Hearn made the play-by-play job look like so much fun. It
must have been, for him to keep doing it all of those years, through
3,338 consecutive games, and even after two major surgeries.</LD>
<LD>   I set out on a path to Chick's seat, but took a detour through the
world of writing. During the last few years, it often struck me that
it was a good decision because otherwise I'd still be waiting for him
to vacate the Lakers' play-by-play job.</LD>
<TE>   In retrospect, I should have stuck with the more realistic goal of
growing to be 6-feet-9. You've heard of players who were compared to
Magic, but will anyone ever come close to duplicating Chick?</TE>
<TE>   There's more than just an open chair now. There's a gaping hole in
Lakerland.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been able to follow Wilt Chamberlain with Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and then Shaquille O'Neal. They've gone from Jerry West
to Magic Johnson to Kobe Bryant. They'll never replace Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, the events of last season at least prepared us for
the challenge. Chick missed 56 games after undergoing heart surgery
in December. His return was delayed when he fell and needed hip
replacement surgery in February.</TE>
<TE>   We adjusted to the voice of Paul Sunderland in his absence. And
even when Chick returned to the microphone on April 9, we braced for
his possible retirement after the next season.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go on forever," his wife, Marge, said that night.
"Everything comes to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Chick's death concludes not only a chapter in L.A. Laker history,
but an entire book. Volume I.</TE>
<TE>   Before Fox Sports Net and its cable predecessor, Prime Ticket,
existed, the way to catch Laker home games was to listen to Hearn on
the radio. There were so many nights with the lights out, the clock
radio on, Mom letting me stay up past bedtime through the end of the
fourth quarter--because it was the Lakers and this was really
important. If it was a dramatic game, the next day my friends braced
themselves for my inevitable replay of Hearn's call.</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of other Laker fans, during playoff games I turned
down the sound on the CBS telecasts of postseason games and turned up
Hearn on the radio. Even with the annoying background buzz on KLAC's
AM signal, Hearn still sounded better than CBS announcer Tom
Heinsohn.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to Laker broadcasts meant you never had to study the
rules of the game because Chick taught you. He taught me the
dimensions of the court. He taught me that the team that wins the
opening tipoff will have possession to start the fourth quarter, that
the losing team gets the ball to start the second and third quarters.
He even made the complicated old illegal-defense rules sound simple
when he described a player in violation: "He was guarding the paint,
and it's not going anywhere. It's dry."</TE>
<TE>   Every time I see a shot bounce off the rim and over the backboard,
I hear Chick saying, "Up and over and out."</TE>
<TE>   Think of how challenging it must have been to verbally illustrate
some of Magic's passes. But did you ever feel shortchanged when Hearn
described them?</TE>
<TE>   Didn't you feel as if you knew exactly what was happening when
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would swing left, shoot right to unleash his
skyhook? Or when Hearn took you step by step through Jamaal Wilkes'
funky jump shot: "He sets ... he fires ... he gets!"?</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, he provided the two perfect words to describe one
of the most exciting plays in sports: "Slammmmm dunk!"</TE>
<TE>   He certified good Laker victories, because if the Lakers could
meet his demanding standards, they must have played well. And at the
most agonizing times, he still held out glimmers of hope. I might
have jumped off my friend's balcony after the Lakers had lost Game 7
of the '84 NBA Finals in Boston if Chick hadn't reminded everyone in
the waning moments of the game that the sun would still be shining
the next day and life would go on.</TE>
<TE>   When Mom took me to my first Laker game as a sixth-grader, I was
so excited that we entered the Forum as soon as they opened the
doors. Long before the first player came out to practice, Chick was
at his customary seat--high above the western sideline--preparing for
the game, going through imaginary play-by-play out loud.</TE>
<TE>   During a break, he let me come up to the booth and he signed my
program. He was nice to me then, he was nice to me whenever we talked
these last five years I've been working at The Times. No one ever
gave me more compliments on my writing.</TE>
<TE>   I saw him often throughout the playoffs. He might have looked
frail, he might have needed help to get around the arena, but I never
thought about what a remarkable feat it was for him to be there. It
seemed normal. If there's a Laker game, you need a basketball,
referees and Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't seem as if an era had ended when he gave up the
microphone in December because you always had the sense he'd be back.
Even when the bad news came over the weekend, I refused to write him
off. No one could close the refrigerator door except Hearn or a
higher power--and I'm not talking about the Laker chain of command.</TE>
<TE>   So now Chick takes his seat next to Jim Murray along the heavenly
press row, while the rest of us struggle to find the right words to
describe someone who used them so deftly.</TE>
<TE>   Our condolences to Marge, whom we got to know through Chick's
frequent mentions during his broadcasts, a woman who is even nicer in
person.</TE>
<TE>   What else can we do? Here's one small suggestion: Before they
raise the newest championship banner on Oct. 29, the Lakers should
retire Hearn's jersey--No. 3,338.</TE>
<TE>   He called the Lakers' victory in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, so he
should be a part of the ceremony. Let's be glad he came back for one
last playoff run, and that the Lakers took care of business so that
Volume I could end the way it should have. Chick Hearn goes out a
winner.</TE>

<HD>Washburn Keeps Rolling Along</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Angel ace improves to 14-3 as Anaheim pulls
closer to first place with 11-2 win over White Sox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>If the playoffs started today, the Angels would play the New York
Yankees. Jarrod Washburn would start the first game, in majestic
Yankee Stadium, amid all the history and pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Who else could the Angels possibly select? When he pitches well,
the Angels win. When he does not pitch quite so well, as was the case
Tuesday, the Angels win too.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon hit a grand slam, and Brad Fullmer hit his fourth home
run in his last four starts, as the Angels pounded out 17 hits and
pummeled the Chicago White Sox 11-2. The Angels took a 1 1/2-game
lead over the Boston Red Sox in the American League wild-card race
and closed within 1 1/2 games of the Seattle Mariners in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels are 22 games over .500, a record that suggests two or
three big winners on the pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Nope, just Washburn, at 11 games over .500. None of the other
starters is more than one game over .500.</TE>
<TE>   At 14-3, Washburn has the most victories by an Angel pitcher since
Chuck Finley won 15 games in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like when Fin was here," Salmon said. "He's the guy
to go to when you need a win."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn always gives you that chance. A pitcher is forgiven a bad
game every now and then, and Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz and Aaron Sele
each have given up more than five runs three times this season.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn never has. In his three losses, the Angels have scored a
total of three runs.</TE>
<TE>   They scored early and often Tuesday against Chicago starter Dan
Wright, who has faced the Angels twice in his career. The Angels won
those games by a combined score of 30-2.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon drove in five runs and hit the first grand slam this season
by any Angel besides 5-foot-7 shortstop David Eckstein. Said Salmon:
"How about that?"</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer said he never had hit home runs in four consecutive
starts. This season has been a challenging one for him, since Manager
Mike Scioscia does not play him against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "When I get locked in, I can do some good things," Fullmer said.
"I'm such a timing guy. The more consistent work I get, the better
chance I have to get locked in at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson, the epitome of consistency, doubled and singled
before leaving the laugher to rest his sore hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   On a night Washburn said he "really wasn't that sharp," he shut
out the White Sox for the first five innings before tiring in the
sixth, by which time the Angels led, 10-0. He needed an excessive 115
pitches to finish six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia envisions Washburn in the mold of some of the staff
leaders he caught when he played for the Dodgers, guys like Orel
Hershiser and Fernando Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the makeup," Scioscia said. "He has the intangibles. He
has the stuff."</TE>
<TE>   What he has not had, so far, is the durability. He has been on the
disabled list in each of the last two seasons, last year not because
of his arm but because of strep throat. He has not missed a start
this season, and he credits an off-season training regimen for that
success.</TE>
<TE>   If he finishes the season strong, and if his teammates do as well,
the Angels could display their ace pitcher on the playoff stage.
That, Scioscia said, is where the big-game pitchers make a name for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a long way to go to be considered a great pitcher,"
Washburn said. "If we did make the playoffs and I pitched well, that
would be a start.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've got to keep doing what I'm doing now for a few years
before I could be considered a great pitcher. I don't think anybody
can be considered a great pitcher based on having one good year."</TE>
<TE>   What Washburn cannot do, apparently, is get ready for a possible
playoff start by recalling how one of his heroes did while pitching
in the national spotlight. You know, someone like Hershiser or
Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   And who was his hero?</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would hit," Washburn said. "Don Mattingly."</TE>

<HD>Cautionary Tale Ends in Dodger Loss</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Hoffman holds a runner, Tracy saves bullpen and
team falls out of wild-card lead after 3-1 setback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are tense times for the Dodgers, who since early July have
wilted in the heat of the pennant race, and Tuesday night's 3-1 loss
to the Pittsburgh Pirates, in which pivotal decisions by third base
coach Glenn Hoffman and Manager Jim Tracy backfired, will only add to
the mounting pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Hyzdu, Kevin Young and Jason Kendall each hit solo home runs
off left-hander Odalis Perez, and Pittsburgh right-hander Josh Fogg
(11-7) gave up one run and eight hits in 7 1/3 innings before a
Dodger Stadium crowd of 31,254, dropping the Dodgers to 8-17 since
the All-Star break and a half-game behind San Francisco in the
wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   But the outcome might have been different had Hoffman not been
uncharacteristically cautious, had Mark Grudzielanek been running
with his head up and had Tracy not been so protective of a bullpen
that had been battered for 31 earned runs in 44 innings (a 6.34
earned-run average) in the previous 14 games, blowing three of seven
save opportunities.</LD>
<TE>   With runners on first and second and no outs in the sixth inning
of a 1-1 game, Tracy let No. 7 batter Grudzielanek swing away instead
of bunt. If Grudzielanek sacrificed, Tracy figured, the Pirates would
walk Alex Cora, the No. 8 hitter, force him to pull Perez for a
pinch-hitter and go to his bullpen in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   But Grudzielanek struck out, Cora flied to right, Perez grounded
to first, and a promising rally died.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh first baseman Kevin Young golfed a Perez fastball into
the left-field seats in the top of the seventh, giving the Pirates a
2-1 lead, Kendall homered off the glove of leaping left fielder Brian
Jordan in the eighth for a 3-1 lead, and Pirate closer Mike Williams
retired the side in order in the ninth for his 33rd save.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy seemed determined to give his bullpen some rest. Paul
Quantrill appeared in eight of nine games before Tuesday, and
recently acquired Paul Shuey pitched in six of seven, accumulating a
9.64 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Middle reliever Giovanni Carrara has looked ragged at times,
left-hander Jesse Orosco has warmed up so often he hasn't been
available some days, and even closer Eric Gagne gave up runs in three
of his last five appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy has often emphasized the importance of pacing the bullpen,
so as to avoid a repeat of 2001, when he practically ran his only two
reliable relievers, Matt Herges and Carrara, into the ground in an
effort to keep the Dodgers' playoff hopes alive in August and
September.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we kind of pushing it to the limit? Yes, we are," Tracy said
of the bullpen's workload. "Have we passed the limit? I don't think
so. You do get to the point where you have to draw a line, and five
days in a row [for Quantrill] was enough. ...</TE>
<TE>   "But we're nowhere near to the extent [of being overworked] as we
were last year with Herges and Carrara. We had two choices then--use
them and stay in the race or rest them and drop out of the race. We
have more options this year."</TE>
<TE>   Not offensively. The Dodgers, who have been held to two runs or
less in 11 of 25 games since the All-Star break, seem to invent ways
to squander scoring opportunities, and they came up with a new one
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   With Adrian Beltre on first and one out in the second,
Grudzielanek blooped a broken-bat fly to shallow left. Brian Giles
rushed in and attempted a diving catch, but the ball caromed off his
cap and into center field.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, who held near second until the ball dropped, took off for
third and reached the bag as Hyzdu reached the ball in medium center.
It appeared Beltre would score--Grudzielanek thought so, because he
never stopped around second--but Hoffman held Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers wound up with two runners on third, and Beltre was
tagged out. Cora, whose RBI single in the fourth tied the game, 1-1,
followed with a groundout to shortstop that probably would have
scored a runner from third.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a freak play, the ball bounced off [Giles'] head and
rolled to center," Hoffman said. "It was a screwed-up play. I stopped
[Beltre], that was my decision, and [Grudzielanek] kept going."</TE>

<HD>Tough Act to Follow</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Team doesn't want to address matter of
replacements, but many are expected to be interested. Memorial
service will be private.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is two days after the death of Chick Hearn. It is two days before
he will be eulogized on Friday in a private ceremony that will be
telecast to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Laker and broadcast officials are not ready to address something
they have not had to consider since the team moved here from
Minneapolis in 1960.</LD>
<LD>   They are going to have to find a replacement for the only
play-by-play announcer the Los Angeles Lakers have ever had.</LD>
<TE>   "That subject is not on the immediate radar screen for the
Lakers," team spokesman Bob Steiner said Tuesday. "We know it's an
important decision and it will be given all the consideration it
deserves, but at the appropriate time."</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 station manager Pat McClenahan said, "There's no way to
ever try and duplicate what Laker telecasts were like with Chick
Hearn. Whoever the replacement is, that person is not going to be
Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   "When the time is appropriate, the Lakers will start the process
and we will be part of that process. We will work with the Lakers to
find the best possible replacement for the best announcing job in the
NBA."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers hire the announcers, who have always been paid by the
team, but their broadcast partners are asked for input.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Simpson, general manager of Fox Sports Net, and Robin
Bertolucci, program director at Laker flagship radio station KLAC
(570), declined to discuss the issue of a replacement for Hearn at
this time.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and their broadcast partners will have to find two
replacements for Hearn, who has always announced games for both radio
and television, a practice called simulcasting.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will no longer simulcast. There will be separate
announcing teams for radio and television.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland substituted for Hearn when he missed 56 games last
season because of heart surgery and a subsequent hip surgery.
Sunderland's work was generally well-received, and he is considered a
front-runner for the television play-by-play job, presumably
alongside Stu Lantz.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking anything about that situation," Sunderland said
Tuesday. "I have just lost someone very important in my life in Chick
Hearn, someone I admire as much as anyone in the world. That is all I
am thinking about."</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland, who works for NBC and Fox Sports Net, was called in on
a day's notice to replace Hearn. At the time, Channel 9 executives
felt slighted because they weren't consulted.</TE>
<TE>   But McClenahan, as well as his boss, Don Corsini, had no
complaints about the job Sunderland did.</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate for a play-by-play position with the Lakers is
Joel Meyers, a Southern Californian who has announced San Antonio
Spur games on cable TV in recent years and is currently a radio
announcer for the St. Louis Cardinals. He has replaced the late Jack
Buck.</TE>
<TE>   Many others have expressed interest, and it has been learned that
candidates or their agents have already begun applying.</TE>
<TE>   "The job of announcing for the Lakers is a gem, one of the most
desired jobs in the league," said George Blaha, who has been with the
Detroit Pistons for 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are only two reasons someone wouldn't want that
job.</TE>
<TE>   "One is, they wouldn't want to try and follow in Chick Hearn's
footsteps. The second is, they're happy where they're at."</TE>
<TE>   Blaha said he falls into the second category. "I'm a native of
Michigan and I don't think there is any job that would pry me away
from the Pistons," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Clipper announcer Ralph Lawler said he too is happy where
he is and added, "I wouldn't want to walk in the shoes of the guy who
has to fill Chick's shoes." But Lawler realizes a lot of announcers,
particularly young ones, would jump at the chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think some people will covet the Laker job," he said. "They'll
be coming out of the woodwork. They'll mostly be minor league and
college announcers. Those guys will do anything to get the job.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think most guys in the NBA now would be hesitant to take
that job."</TE>
<TE>   Another NBA announcer disagreed. "I think there are 10 to 15
announcers in the league who would jump at that job."</TE>
<TE>   The position of TV play-by-play announcer is particularly
important going into next season because under the NBA's new TV
contract there will be no cable blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   That means Laker telecasts on Channel 9 and Fox Sports Net will
often be competing with ESPN or TNT telecasts. Having Hearn would
have given the Lakers a needed edge.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, the Lakers and their broadcast partners would like to
find a marketable name. And that won't be easy. The job doesn't come
close to paying what a network job pays.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn reportedly was making about $500,000 a year, although as
Blaha pointed out, "Chick was worth millions to the franchise."</TE>
<TE>   The new Laker announcers would figure to make about $300,000 for
TV and $200,000 for radio, based on what other NBA announcers make in
major markets.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a big name won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Enberg, who lives in La Jolla, said Tuesday he would not be
interested in the job, even on a limited basis. He worked 40 games
for the Angels in 1985, the team's 25th year, and said that did not
go well.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I worked only 40 games, I had to keep up with the
team as though I were working every game," he said. "But I was still
missing most of the games, and that made it hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   Al Michaels, a longtime Southern Californian, said, "Even if I
were interested, my contract with ABC would not allow me to announce
Laker games."</TE>

<HD>She Really Likes What She Sees</HD>
<DH>Serena is bubbling over with confidence after rising to No.

<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to her official biography in the WTA tour media guide,
Serena Williams' favorite place to visit is "the mirror in her
house."</LD>
<LD>   These days, the smiling blond reflection is especially regal.</LD>
<LD>   The self-assured Serena, seeded No. 1 this week in the JPMorgan
Chase Open at Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, last month
supplanted older sister Venus as the world's top-ranked women's
tennis player.</LD>
<TE>   Venus, 22, still leads in Grand Slam events won, four to three,
but the muscular Serena, 20, stepped out of her sister's lanky shadow
this summer by winning the French Open and Wimbledon championships.
Defeating Venus in both finals, she took her first major titles since
the 1999 U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly the power player setting the standard on the WTA tour,
Serena has won 50 of 54 matches since squandering six match points
last August at Manhattan Beach in an improbable quarterfinal loss to
Monica Seles.</TE>
<TE>   She has won three matches in a row in straight sets over Venus--on
a hard-court surface in the semifinals at Miami in March, on clay in
the French Open two months ago and on grass at Wimbledon last month.</TE>
<TE>   A champion in seven of her last 11 tournaments, among them the
season-ending tour championships last November at Munich, Serena has
won her last three events and will carry a 19-match winning streak
into her second-round match tonight against Lina Krasnoroutskaya of
Russia. It will be Serena's first as the world's No. 1-ranked player.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy," the Wimbledon champion said this week during a
brief news conference at Manhattan Beach. "I've never been this happy
in my career. I'm No. 1. I've won a few more Grand Slams.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I've been wanting to do all my life, and I want to
do more. I have so much more that I would like to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, I'm just getting started."</TE>
<TE>   Serena jump-started the Williams' Grand Slam victory parade three
years ago when she surprised herself--and stunned her sister--by
winning the U.S. Open a few weeks before she celebrated her 18th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   But her title was seen almost as an aberration when Venus shot to
the top of the rankings, winning consecutive Wimbledon and U.S. Open
championships.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of five daughters born to Richard and Oracene
Williams, Venus and Serena have been packaged as a flamboyant team
known simply as "The Sisters," but Venus had clearly been the better
of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Serena, her ranking sliding up and down the lower register of the
top 10 but never climbing higher than No. 4, didn't reach the final
of another Grand Slam event until last year's U.S. Open. Her 6-2, 6-4
loss to Venus left her 1-5 against her sister.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, little sister has bulldozed her way to the
top, her percussive power game producing a 36-3 record and five
titles this year.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always been there," Venus said this week, sharing a stage
with her sister for a product endorsement. "So it's no surprise to
me."</TE>
<TE>   But something has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not missing as much," Venus said. "[There] comes a point
where you just have to stop [making errors], and she found that
point, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Had Venus seen it coming? After all, the sisters share a mansion
in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., not to mention a practice court and a
close relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Not really," Venus said, laughing. "She didn't give me the heads
up."</TE>
<TE>   Nor had others been warned.</TE>
<TE>   An ankle injury forced Serena to sit out the Australian Open, the
only Grand Slam event she has not won. Rejecting suggestions she was
a hypochondriac, she won titles at Scottsdale, Ariz., and Miami
before heading off to Europe, where she added the Italian, French and
Wimbledon titles.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, she forged her own identity, apart from her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think I was Venus," she told reporters after her
Wimbledon victory. "I thought I liked things she liked. I realized I
didn't like tomatoes. I don't like mushrooms. I had to realize I was
a different kind of person.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this kind of helped. From little things like that to
bigger things, I realize I'm a totally different person than she is."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, she is more outgoing. And, for now, maybe hungrier?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play the same game Serena plays," Venus said at
Wimbledon. "For her, it's all or nothing. For me, it's not this."</TE>
<TE>   Not even the arrest of a German man allegedly stalking her could
keep Serena from ending her sister's 20-match Wimbledon winning
streak. A 7-6 (4), 6-3 winner in the final, she seemed unmoved by the
arrest outside the grounds a few days earlier of Albrecht Stromeyer,
who allegedly had pursued her for months.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just really mentally focused this summer," she said this
week, speaking generally of her breakthrough. "I really wanted to win
these tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't lost [the desire to win]. I'm still trying to get
there. I'm still trying to win a few more. I think [Venus] has [won]
six tournaments this year [after Sunday's victory at Carlsbad], so I
have to catch up to her again."</TE>
<TE>   Displacing her sister at the top of the world rankings was
difficult emotionally, Serena indicated, but if anybody was going to
do it, why not her?</TE>
<TE>   "At this level, everyone's fighting," she said. "I'm sure Venus is
definitely going to try to come up and get me again. I think if you
get there [to No. 1], it really doesn't matter ... who you have to
overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Her ascent to No. 1, she realizes, couldn't have been better
timed.</TE>
<TE>   Her clothing contract with Puma expires this year, and it has been
speculated that a new deal could be worth more than her sister's
reported $40-million contract with Reebok, the most lucrative in
history for a female athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Serena declined to address the topic this week, but when asked at
Wimbledon if her expiring contract was an incentive to "show the
world and next shoe company" that she was worth it, she jumped on it
like a lazy service return.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I definitely am," she told reporters. "I'm really exciting.
I smile a lot. I win a lot, and I'm really sexy."</TE>
<TE>   Looking into her mirror, Serena Williams likes what she sees.</TE>
