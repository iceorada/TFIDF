<HD>The Music Is the Message</HD>
<DH>Leila Steinberg, an unlikely ambassador of hip-hop, informs and
inspires at high schools, detention centers and foster homes.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Crenshaw High School, the students boo before Leila Steinberg
gets  a chance to greet them. When she goes downtown to a group home for
troubled teens, they kick aside their chairs and yell, in not so many
words, that they aren't up for any empty talk. At Beverly Hills High,
they just yawn.</LD>
<LD>   Steinberg, 40, is used to ruthless adolescent judgment--she faces it
weekly as the founder of Assemblies in Motion, a nonprofit organization
of hip-hop artists who perform at socially minded assemblies for high
schools, detention centers and foster homes. Steinberg confesses that
being a white Jewish mother can undermine her image as a force in rap.
But she also points out that her fair complexion and last name made
helping launch the careers of early hip-hop stars, including Mac Mall and
the late Tupac Shakur, possible. "Doors were opened to me [in the record
industry] that were still closed to them because they were black." The
kids in the audience sit up a little straighter.</LD>
<TE>   Steinberg grew up in Watts and is herself an artist who once performed
with world music greats OJ Ekemode and the Nigerian Allstars. She
ultimately decided to focus not on performing, but on raising art out of
the inner cities and, then, taking it back in--as education. "We have
really failed children in the school system [by undervaluing the arts],"
she says, preferring to emulate a time in human history when art was used
to educate, to connect, to reform, to vent and to document. "One artist
can have more impact on an entire school system than all the academic
classes put together, but there are no educators for artists and artists
don't understand that they're educators." She believes it is high time to
call on today's performers to be teachers, voices and tools of social
change.</TE>
<TE>   To this end, Steinberg, who relocated her family and work to Los
Angeles from the Bay Area less than a year ago, runs an ecosystem of
projects, including Moses Soul (a record label and film production
company), the Microphone Sessions (a raucous Monday night performance
workshop) and Assemblies in Motion (the education-oriented top of
Steinberg's food chain).</TE>
<TE>   Benefiting from any cash flowing out of Moses Soul, Assemblies in
Motion also pulls the best talent from the open-to-the-public Microphone
Sessions, held at legendary Studio 56 in Hollywood, where Elvis Presley,
Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane all
recorded soundtracks.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, the current members of Assemblies in Motion--or AIM, as
it is most often called--still attend the workshops, perfecting new
pieces in front of the mostly black inner-city adults who are themselves
present to work on their own poetry and music. This week, Steinberg, in
collaboration with Quincy Jones and his son, Quincy D. Jones III, will
see the DVD release of "Thug Angel: The Life of an Outlaw," a documentary
about Shakur, with whom Steinberg worked in the Bay Area's Microphone
Sessions and AIM projects of the '80s. Steinberg also was executive
producer with Tracy Robinson and Jones III on the film's soundtrack, to
be released in May.</TE>
<TE>   It was as one of the only white kids in '70s Watts that Steinberg
recalls discerning her privilege. "I always understood that I could very
easily get away with anything; the other kids asked me to do things for
them, to get people's attention because they couldn't." In the early
'80s, she and her then-husband Bruce Crawford, a prominent black DJ from
Los Angeles, moved to Sonoma, where she found work as the artistic
director of the Petaluma Cultural Center. On the side, Steinberg
organized her husband's musical events and concerts.</TE>
<TE>   With her love of world music and his of rap, the duo became well-known
in the Bay Area for hosting some of the most rousing concerts of the
time, with thousands of revelers trudging in from all over to check out
the unusual combination of African, reggae, rap, rock and world music.
"We had thousands of kids at the events, so I knew what I could do in
terms of bridging cultures and communities and aligning artists." Pretty
soon, she also had the biggest names in hip-hop headlining, including New
Kids on the Block, Tone Loc, Digital Underground and Egyptian Lover. But
Steinberg always made room on the stage for talented unknowns.</TE>
<TE>   In producing the shows, Steinberg saw the tremendous power and
political potential of rap. She set out to create a multicultural
performance company that would combine poetry, rap, hip-hop and dance
that were also relevant social statements, "so that people would walk
away transformed," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it was her agenda or their own, artists turned out by the
hundreds to her weekly tryouts. Word on the street at the time was that
if you wanted a record deal, you had to meet this "white girl of
hip-hop." Not only did she produce huge events with big stars, she was
rumored to know everyone in the industry, and to be able to get in the
doors of record companies. The influx of people desiring a chance on the
tryout stage never ebbed, however, and Steinberg realized that it was in
itself a movement. Thus began the Microphone Sessions.</TE>
<TE>A Chance Meeting Leads to a Partnership</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in the same city, a young artist named Tupac Shakur heard
the rumors about Steinberg and set out to find her. But, the afternoon in
1986 that he met her, he was not thinking about music. She was a white
woman sitting on the grass outside Bayside Elementary School in Marin
County, quietly reading a book about Winnie Mandela, and, Shakur, on a
school-time ramble about town, stopped in his tracks to scold her.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me a break," he said. "What do you know about Winnie Mandela?"
Steinberg, who taught an art class at Bayside, said she would be able to
tell him something, but not until she'd finished the book. But Shakur,
who was a prolific reader, proceeded to grill her--until he was impressed
enough by her grasp of black culture to ask for her name. When he learned
it, he laughed at destiny. He'd found his mentor.</TE>
<TE>   So, it turns out, had Steinberg. At only 16, Shakur was already
celebrated on the street for his explosive and articulate talent. Friends
who had seen him perform reported that the boy's gift for writing and
captivating audiences was just what her group needed. Indeed, the evening
of their first meeting, Shakur accompanied Steinberg to the Microphone
Sessions. Soon after, the two launched AIM, performing at one crammed Bay
Area high school assembly after another. As their work with high school
audiences progressed, Steinberg distanced herself more and more from the
concerts on which she'd worked so hard. Her priority now was AIM--and
helping Shakur find his place in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "What made Tupac special was the fact that he put his soul on the
record. There are very few artists who give it up like that anymore,"
says Jones III. "I think [Steinberg] taught him how to do that, how to
not be afraid to say who he was."</TE>
<TE>    Steinberg's role in the young artist's life was pivotal, says
Shakur's mother: "We are all indebted to Leila, Tupac's first manager and
adult friend, for her integrity in looking after the safety of [his]
work," says Afeni Shakur.</TE>
<TE>   When Steinberg recounts the story of how she and Tupac Shakur met, her
teen audience at an AIM assembly at Beverly High settle, finally, into
their seats. Steinberg laughs, knowing that while the ice is breaking,
the kids still aren't convinced that she can entertain them. "But once I
bring my artists out, every one of these kids transforms," she says.
"Whether they're white, black, in jail or in Malibu, young people respond
to music."</TE>
<TE>    Out slides Kumasi, the handsome black schoolteacher and Islamic
fundamentalist who raps in a smooth voice about life in the streets. "I'm
a soldier," he intones, "in the war of life.... Where are the captains?
We're losing men...."</TE>
<TE>    Then, Java, an actor in the recent film "Baby Boy" and the one
expected to make it big for his brilliant writing and acting talents.
There's Hope, whose voice stirs goose bumps, and Fatso, who wrote a song
about his mother's crack addiction and his life without a role model.
When the kids see Mo, they giggle and point--he plays a character on the
television show "Boston Public." GaKnew, for whom the kids stand up and
cheer, closes with a story about forgiving white people for the
historical treatment of blacks, and about being an American.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg was right: The audience is rapt.</TE>
<TE>   At Beverly, students rush the stage to slap hands, hug and get
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   At Crenshaw, hecklers are moved to tears.</TE>
<TE>   At a group home for troubled teens, boys stay an extra two hours to
talk politics and social issues.</TE>
<TE>   But Steinberg's theme of music and transformation has been important
for the young artists as well as for the teen spectators. As AIM members,
GaKnew and the others were culled from the large, regular crowd that
attends the Microphone Sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The Microphone Sessions, as the classes became known in the Bay Area
because of Steinberg's mandate to "get up to the stage" and perform, are
composed mostly of young African Americans from the inner city. While
many are now successful actors, producers and publicists, many more have
histories as drug addicts and dealers, gang members and felons. Many tell
stories about addicted mothers. Steinberg, who has been a foster
parent--officially or informally--to more than 15 kids in the last 10
years, has heard it all, and encourages her artists to write about those
experiences. There is no censorship in her sessions, and no rules except
honesty.</TE>
<TE>Discussion About Current Events</TE>
<TE>   On a Monday night at the Microphone Sessions, Steinberg perches on a
large speaker near the stage inside Studio 56. She opens the evening with
a discussion about current events, and then asks for volunteers to
perform. No one moves.</TE>
<TE>   "What's up, Fatso?" Steinberg calls out. "Come up here, please."</TE>
<TE>    The young man, who is confident on stage at AIM assemblies, seems
suddenly self-conscious. "I don't got anything tonight, Leila." He waits
with his head down.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you do. You're up. Get up there." Steinberg points to the stage.
The class, reclining in chairs and couches scattered about the room,
watches intently.</TE>
<TE>   "Send it!" cries a woman moving into his abandoned hiding place. There
is laughter at the familiar blessing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Fatso. Fatso Fasano," he declares, all coolness now. "This is to
you, little brother," he says, nodding to a 16-year-old near Steinberg.
The boy has just told the class he's going to be the father of twins.</TE>
<TE>   Fatso explains that he wrote the song for his friend Hope to sing, but
she's not here tonight. Fatso goes for it himself, but Steinberg stops
him and sends another artist, Molly, to the stage. Although she has never
seen the lyrics, she leans in, her voice wavering at first and then
rising, booming out into the room.</TE>
<TE>   Fatso and other AIM members often attend both the Microphone Sessions
and once- or twice-weekly assemblies, work Steinberg considers crucial to
the artists'--and society's--growth.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to be stars, of course," she says of her artists. They know
she can help them with record deals when the time comes, but her plan is
to make sure they are giving back to the community before then.</TE>
<TE>   Fatso, a former hustler, says that "working with Leila inspired me to
make a difference and help change the world, to be a part of the solution
instead of the problem."</TE>
<TE>    Being socially responsible isn't always financially easy. It costs
money to put on AIM assemblies, even though the artists perform free. To
keep AIM going, Steinberg pours money earned from Moses Soul into her
workshops and the early careers of her artists. Additionally, Paul
Schwartz donates the use of Studio 56 because, he says, he believes in
the art that springs from the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of her high school assemblies, Steinberg usually opens a
forum for free discussion--about race, political issues and society. For
a person to be truly powerful, she says, as an artist or otherwise, she
must be articulate, well-read and understand the strength and meaning of
what she is saying. "The more you look at [history] through the music of
the times, the more you understand what was going on. Textbooks tell us
what the government thought. Music tells us about the people."</TE>
<TE>    Steinberg talks of a final and important lesson--ironically, one
Shakur never learned before his death in Las Vegas in 1996: the need for
artists to believe in the power of their words.</TE>
<TE>   "Pac talked a lot about death in his songs," she recalls. "A lot of
people believed that he was foreseeing his death rather than creating
it." His words had power that he didn't respect, she says. "Pac wrote
himself out of his script. He didn't understand the real power of what he
was saying."</TE>

<HD>A Scholar Reinterprets '60s Social Evolution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an irony that's long puzzled Alice Echols: For all of the '60s'
noble "question authority" rhetoric, the decade of the long, strange
trip often gets the rose-colored glasses treatment.</LD>
<LD>   As memory fades, many of us, she contends, have been swept up by a
touched-up '60s that's part Oliver Stone-esque impressionistic
history, part remastered "Greatest Groovy Hits."</LD>
<LD>   As this telling would have it, while hippies were turning on,
radicals fought on the front lines of social and political change,
sparking a groundswell. And by 1969--with the violence at a concert
at Altamont--it was over. Revolutionary fervor morphed into shattered
idealism. Revolution had somehow become "Saturday Night Fever."</LD>
<TE>   But that familiar telling is too simplistic to Echols' ear.</TE>
<TE>   A feminist lecturer and historian, she has taken it upon herself
to reconsider the pieces. Those seemingly jarring turn of events, she
suggests, aren't as illogical as they might seem. From academia to
the airwaves and beyond, Echols often sees evidence of just how well
we do or don't understand the '60s. Often, in the college classrooms
where she lectures, she hears the criticism or question before it's
voiced: "'I just want to know how we got from people protesting in
the streets to disco!'" Echols relays in a wide-eyed pantomime. "I
just smile because, of course, there was no discontinuity for me.
This was completely continuous."</TE>
<TE>   In her new book, "Shaky Ground: The Sixties and Its Aftershocks"
(Columbia University Press, 2002), Echols looks at a continuum of
social change that begins in the '50s and winds its way to present
day--informing race, identity, sexuality and gender movements.  Along
this path, she deflates some iconic truths about the '60s and
reinterprets phenomena such as disco and the knotty politics of
identity as extensions of social movements with '60s roots.</TE>
<TE>   For Echols, disco, a key '60s "aftershock," is an engine of social
revolution. "It spoke to those not included in '60s rock culture:
minorities, gays, women," she says, and provided a greater
possibility for interracial connectedness than the hippie movement
had been able to deliver. It wasn't an aberration. It was pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   The '60s, she contends, wasn't the big bang, a "golden moment when
the ideas and values of dominant culture were banished." Actually,
says Echols, a lecturer in the women's studies program at UCLA, it
was the spark. It may have started the conversations that led to
change, she argues, but it didn't obliterate strict gender roles,
didn't foster sincere openness to alternative lifestyles or fully
realize racial integration and parity.</TE>
<TE>   Providing a Link</TE>
<TE>   for Disparate Theories</TE>
<TE>   Boasting prodigious footnotes, "Shaky Ground" links the
scattershot theories--early feminist treatises, Civil Rights oral
histories, political memoirs and studies of the long-range influence
of plugged-in rock 'n' roll--that poured forth over the last 40 years
but have often only existed on parallel planes. Echols, 51, hopes to
create a more layered rendering of the '60s and its legacy by
braiding disparate strands into one volume.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, "Shaky Ground" is a bit bumpy. The book splinters
from the weight of her desire to be far-reaching and inclusive.
Ranging broadly in scope and tone, the book's academic essays on
cultural versus radical feminism don't always seamlessly segue into,
say, her alternative press Q&amp;A with Lenny Kravitz or conversation
with Joni Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its jaggedness, the collection is compelling when Echols
mines unusual spaces--the hidden compartments of sexual ambiguity,
the sweaty floors of disco- theques--to trace the far-reaching
reverberations of post-'60s social movements. "There were all these
'60s books coming out in the '80s," recalls Echols, casual, in jeans,
t-shirt and well-traveled Merrell hiking shoes, brown hair
wind-tousled. And as an academic who had adopted the decade as her
field of study, she was knee-deep in them: histories, memoirs and
essays written primarily by white, male veterans of the radical New
Left who highlighted "'60s exceptionalism" and made the case that the
decade was as singular as it was exemplary.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that that isn't important," says Echols. But the sameness of
the perspective began to wear on her. "I wanted to look at different
areas--Janis Joplin, the women's movement, R&amp;B--that have been
trivialized or caricatured in histories of the '60s and render a more
complicated meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, she says, "I've always been involved in moving margins
to the center."</TE>
<TE>   Echols begins by firmly integrating the counterculture into the
political history of the '60s. "More people," she writes, "passed
through 'love ghettos' like Haight-Ashbury than took part in the
Students for Democratic Society, the leading New Left group of the
1960s." What transpired in the close spaces of neighborhoods, loosely
configured households and electric ballrooms of San Francisco is as
important to her as what was advancing on the front lines of
America's moral conflicts--opposition to the Vietnam war and racial
inequality. She challenges standard wisdom "that the counterculture
was all about 'goofy optimism,' an especially durable myth among baby
boomers."</TE>
<TE>   In convening her collection of voices--discordant, conflicted,
exhilarated--Echols drew on many disciplines and media, from Joan
Didion's vivid journalism portraits and Canadian feminist Shulamith
Firestone's groundbreaking "The Dialectic of Sex" to the seismic
shifts in 40 years of popular music.</TE>
<TE>   Testing the Limits</TE>
<TE>   Through Music</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Echols, who has also worked as DJ in clubs and discos,
finds a sturdy, extended metaphor in music--from Joplin's commitment
to high-risk living she summed up as "superhypermost" and Sly Stone's
"you can't figure out the bag I'm in" to Kravitz's "can't put me in a
box." Even as social movements pushed forward, she suggests,
musicians felt constrained by the mainstream's outdated definitions
and boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that popular culture can be transgressive and
empowering," Echols writes of the late '80s, "is appealing in a
period when mass-based political protest has sometimes seemed a thing
of the past."</TE>
<TE>   Music became a laboratory to test the limits--not just of artistic
tastes, but of the culture's openness to the uncharted. "Pop music
trashes the borders and boundaries," says Echols, sitting on the
balcony of her East Hollywood apartment in a neighborhood '60s
idealism would like to lay claim to: artists, day laborers, nuns,
teachers. "It has the ability to shake it all up. We have to look
outside of the frame."</TE>
<TE>   Glimpsing the life of Joplin, for example, with her keep-'em
guessing sexuality coupled with her extrapolation on the blues,
pressed at all sorts of borders of thought. Her revolution was in her
countenance: messy, ragged and impossible to neatly define.</TE>
<TE>   In moving the soundtrack to the forefront, Echols reads the
political and cultural messages in the evolution of R&amp;B and its often
dismissed metamorphosis to disco.</TE>
<TE>   For gay men, black women and the working class, she says, disco
was a site of resilience, "an affront to white middle-class
sensibilities." Echols suggests that the music symbolized a split in
the culture: Disco coincided with deindustrialization, affirmative
action and the rise of feminism and gay liberation. "It feels
inseparable from African Americans' growing apprehension that the
black movement had lost its momentum (not to mention its leaders),"
she writes, "and white America lost its will to change."</TE>
<TE>   In this milieu, "gay men became very visible," says Echols. "Black
women's sexuality was voiced in the music and on the dance floor."</TE>
<TE>   But it was vilified. It didn't square with mainstream notions of
"blackness"--like so much else that was wiggling out of definition.</TE>
<TE>   That's the hitch that impairs or dead-ends each movement in
Echols' survey--gay and lesbian rights, black power, feminism. Even
the margins are ruled by expectation, assumption and the subjective
rules of what's "authentic" and what's allowable.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with those limitations, the margins change the
mainstream. Her optimism is buoyed by the multiracial, multivoiced
give-and-take in her classrooms, the spaces where culture and
politics fuse, "the ways in which the margins get absorbed in popular
culture faster and faster."</TE>
<TE>   It's a '60s-based optimism that she considers guarded, not goofy.
"There is a recuperative force at work," says Echols. "I long for
politics that doesn't confuse who we are with what we can become."</TE>

<TE>   Finally, the actor-comedian escaped into the theater. After the
movie, the girl was waiting for him outside.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Eddie Izzard," she said. "I'm sorry I got the names mixed
up. Can I have your autograph?"</TE>
<TE>   Wearing jeans, a black T-shirt and black leather jacket, Izzard is
amused as he sits outside Chateau Marmont on a recent afternoon,
recounting his anecdote about fame by proxy.</TE>
<TE>   He is in town to promote "The Cat's Meow," a Peter Bogdanovich
movie about the death of director Thomas Ince aboard William Randolph
Hearst's yacht, the Oneida, in 1924.</TE>
<TE>   Izzard plays Charlie Chaplin, who was aboard the yacht at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   When Izzard saw his first Chaplin film on TV, he was not amused.
"I thought it was turgid and unfunny," he says. But after seeing
Chaplin on the big screen, he says, he understood his comedy.</TE>
<TE>   It was only that TV was the wrong medium.</TE>
<TE>   Izzard is thoughtful on every medium, having tried several in the
course of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Yemen to British parents, he studied accounting at a
university in Britain before going into street performance, in his
estimation the toughest scene. "You have to shout over the noises ...
but it became the center of my confidence," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The streets led to the stage--stand-up comedy, with which he made
his name and earned two Emmys in 2000 for his HBO show, "Dress to
Kill."</TE>
<TE>   But Izzard's real passion is dramatic acting. After his roles in
"Shadow of the Vampire" and "The Cat's Meow," Izzard says he is "just
getting up to speed. I'm fascinated by structure," he says. "It's not
part of stand-up. There's no character development in stand-up--only
a flow of consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   In stand-up, "you play to the laughs," he says. In dramatic
acting, "You play to the silence."</TE>
<TE>   Making the transition between stand-up and acting is not always
easy. Izzard cites Robin Williams, Steve Martin and Jim Carrey as
examples of people who have to overcome the audience expectation that
they would do "the crazy stuff."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to smash those previous images," Izzard says. And, he
adds, with a grin, "persuade people to give you the parts."</TE>

<TE>   Connick as Inventor</TE>
<TE>   Singer and composer Harry Connick Jr. can add inventor to his
business card, having recently patented a "system and method for
coordinating music display among players in an orchestra."</TE>
<TE>   In essence, Connick replaced note sheets with computer displays.</TE>
<TE>   No more page turning, just mouse clicks.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it a little bit easier for musicians," said Connick, by
crackling cell phone from San Francisco. Connick, whose current tour
will bring him to the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on Thursday, said he
began using computers for his compositions a couple of years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the computers on stage has so far gone without a hitch.
(Extra computers are kept backstage in case of a technical snafu.)</TE>
<TE>   When Connick makes changes to a given piece, by editing or cutting
parts, the revisions are automatically transmitted to band members'
computers.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys in my band seem to like it," he said. "It's not a cure
for cancer," he added. But "it's pretty cool."</TE>

<TE>   Lampooning Hef</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard Lampoon made Hugh Hefner an honorary member last week,
in a party thrown at the Playboy Mansion. As part of the ceremony,
Hefner received an award from the magazine naming him "The Best
Life-Form in the History of the Universe," a conclusion supported by
Jay Phelan, a UCLA professor of evolutionary biology, in a tongue-in
cheek-speech. During the celebration, Hef was also presented with a
Lampoon bathrobe, a paper crown and a large silver trophy.</TE>

<HD>On Opening Day, a Call for the Return of the Stolen Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KELLY CANDAELE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the gods come to Earth on the baseball diamond this season, I'm
rooting for the thieves and tricksters.</LD>
<LD>   We'd know they were stirring things up if, in today's opening-day
Dodger game, there were four or five stolen bases and no home runs.
That might be a sign that this year we won't have to sit through
another mind-numbing chase to break a home-run record that no longer
seems to matter. It might even signal a shift in the athletic music
of our culture as the crushing logic of the home run surrenders to
the chaos and romance of the stolen base.</LD>
<LD>   In my mind, the real gods of baseball are not Barry Bonds and Mark
McGwire, the long-ball hitters who occasionally stroll around the
bases, never having to strain to beat out a base hit or hurl their
bodies blindly toward second merely to place themselves 90 feet
closer to home.</LD>
<TE>   The more interesting deities are the great base-stealers and
speedsters such as ex-Dodger Maury Wills, ex-Cardinal Lou Brock or
Rickey Henderson, who at 43 just signed with the Red Sox. The ancient
Greeks called the fleet-footed Hermes the "god of the crossroads." He
was an evasive trickster who shook up the static cosmos of the
Olympian world, and, like any good base-stealer, he was full of
mischief and mayhem, a god of accidents and chance encounters. When
he entered the picture, things got interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has ever seen Wills, Brock or Henderson play knows the
tension they created when they reached first base.</TE>
<TE>   Fans knew they would be "going" at the first opportunity, and the
game suddenly became focused on the elaborate flirtation and
seduction taking place between runner, pitcher and catcher, set in
motion by the feints, long leads and the ultimate madness of the rush
toward second.</TE>
<TE>   Watching a great base-stealer is like viewing an exquisite drama.
Each attempted steal has the same basic structure, but an infinite
number of variations depending upon the opposition, the game
situation and runner's psychological preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Wills claimed his record-breaking feats were his way of
communicating with God. When he reached first base, he felt there was
a higher power urging him to run.</TE>
<TE>   He also recognized the less sublime motivations that drove him,
the illicit delight he took in torturing countless pitchers and
catchers who couldn't stop him. Often he would steal a base, he
explained, not because the game situation demanded it, but just so
his opponents would "hate me more." Like St. Augustine, describing
his theft of fruit in his "Confessions," what made his desire sinful
was thievery for its own sake, for the simple pleasure of doing what
was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Ahome run provides a less complex thrill, a sudden cathartic
release of tension that is momentarily satisfying. Sadaharu Oh, the
career home-run king of the Japanese League, describes it as a kind
of Zen utopia, the long arc of a ball hit squarely and for distance
allowing him a temporary release, free of all the "complications ...
and obstructions" of real life.</TE>
<TE>   But the home run is no longer adequate to American society as a
unifying myth. We can't quite sustain its illusion of definitiveness
and strength. Today we live with caprice and chaos, dark primal
social forces we cannot control and an economic landscape that just
yesterday promised a never-ending upward trajectory, only to
disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   A home run launches the ball on a journey into the ephemeral
light. It creates the fantasy that it may never come down, defying
nature's basic laws, disappearing somewhere in the distance. The
stolen base, though, is of the Earth, grounded in the world's gravity
and weight. When a base-stealer is caught, gunned down, nailed--there
is a solitary walk back to the dugout, a melancholy acknowledgment of
life's limits.</TE>
<TE>   The base-stealer, baseball's small entrepreneur, is a more
appropriate hero/underdog for a time when the power machinations of
corporate takeovers have become a spectator sport. Base-stealing is
like our lives--messy, full of fits and starts and entirely
unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fewer and fewer players are adept at what is becoming an
ancient art, and fewer managers regard stealing bases as an effective
offensive tool.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson's 1982 record of 130 stolen bases still stands. At the
time, baseball observers predicted that someone would soon steal 200,
upsetting the finely ordered universe of the game through absolute
success. But only one other player has stolen more than 100 bases
since then, and last year, Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki led the major
leagues with only 56.</TE>
<TE>   Home runs are now part of baseball's economic bottom line and
ballparks are built for hitters, not runners.</TE>
<TE>   Without a home run, fans leave the stadium with the feeling that
somehow, they've been robbed. But there is a price to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Waldo Emerson, who thought a great deal about American
culture, pointed out that there is no way to avoid the tax that the
universe imposes upon those who abandon a sense of limits. In his
essay "Compensation," he wrote that "equity adjusts itself in all
parts of life," and that the "deep remedial force" of nature must
eventually bring balance back to an unstable world. So I wait for the
redemptive grace of a great base-stealer who will release the game
again from its over-dependence on the ephemeral pleasures of the long
ball.</TE>
<TE>   Writer George Plimpton rhapsodizes that "a home run stamps itself
upon the memory like nothing else in sport." But that's not the way
my mom, Helen Callaghan, saw it. She played four years in the All
American Girls Professional Baseball League, immortalized in Penny
Marshall's film "A League of Their Own." She stole 112 bases in 1944,
the same year she led the league in hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back in later years, she spoke only briefly of her home
runs. They were merely a nostalgic blur. But she remembered the
stolen bases with an animated pride, remarking that at times she got
such great jumps off of pitchers that she didn't even have to slide.
She took a special delight in explaining that stealing third was
easier than stealing second because no one expected it. She attempted
to transmit the intricacies of the art to my younger brother Casey,
who played for the Montreal Expos and Houston Astros, but with no
success. She stole more bases in one year than he did in his entire
career.</TE>
<TE>   I saw her play in a reunion game one year, when she was well into
her 60s. She reached first and, sure enough, started tormenting the
pitcher with an outrageous lead.</TE>
<TE>   My mom, shy and soft-spoken off the field, had the sly and evasive
grace of a trickster god when provided the narrative terrain of a
baseball game.</TE>
<TE>   Like all great base-stealers, she was not satisfied to remain on
first, so far from "home." In that first crossover step and drive
toward second, she asserted her freedom, a kind of personal sacrament
and destabilizing jolt against the status quo. By running, she set
the world in motion.</TE>
<TE>   I imagine the quick turn of my mom's shoulders, the frantic thrust
of her arms and the hunger in her pumping legs. I feel today what she
must have felt then. I'll take the mad dash of a great base-stealer
over a lazy trot around the diamond any day.</TE>

<LD>   How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health</LD>
<LD>   By Marion Nestle</LD>
<TE>   University of California Press</TE>
<TE>   480 pages; $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Some foods are better for us than others. For optimum health, it's
important to avoid foods high in fat, salt and sugar. A diet rich in
plant-based foods is better than a diet heavy with animal products or
processed foods. To maintain ideal weight, many of us need to eat
less food than we do.</TE>
<TE>   If these statements sound like common sense, they are. In fact,
they've been preached for decades by nutritionists. And yet,
Americans are in a state of nutritional crisis, according to Marion
Nestle, a respected nutritionist and editor of the 1988 Surgeon
General's Report on Nutrition and Health. In "Food Politics," she
takes a comprehensive look at how the food industry, particularly in
the last 30 years, has distorted Americans' eating patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Between the late 1970s and the early '90s, she reports, the
proportion of overweight adults rose from 25% to 35%. "Just between
1991 and 1998, the rate of adult obesity increased from 12% to nearly
18%." Childhood dietary choices, which often set patterns for
lifetime eating, are appalling: "Rates of obesity are now so high
among American children that many exhibit metabolic abnormalities
formerly seen only in adults" including adult-onset diabetes, high
blood cholesterol and high blood pressure, constituting "a national
health scandal."</TE>
<TE>   This disgrace is the result, in part, of the abundant American
lifestyle. "The food industry has given us a food supply so
plentiful, so varied, so inexpensive ... that all but the very
poorest Americans" can meet their biological needs. There is enough
food, in fact, to feed everyone nearly twice over.</TE>
<TE>   Such oversupply, though, means competition in the marketplace,
which in turn impels food companies to make unsubstantiated health
claims, to rally the consumers' desire for unhealthy products under
the guise of "personal choice" and to skew health ideals to
strengthen their bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   In this readable, if dense, and thought-provoking narrative,
Nestle demonstrates how lobbying, public relations, political
maneuvering and advertising by the food industry work against public
health goals and have helped create a population that's eating itself
sick.</TE>
<TE>   Nestle is an insider when it comes to food policy: She served as a
nutrition policy advisor to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services and as a member of the nutrition and science advisory
committees to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and
Drug Administration. She doesn't suggest radical changes in eating
patterns but, rather, that we take a hard look at what we eat and
why.</TE>
<TE>   As a nation, we need to eat less than we do, and yet we're
constantly bombarded with messages to eat more. Larger servings are
the norm--"supersize" your meal and you get more food for your
dollar--as is relying on processed foods far removed from their
natural states.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, public school districts sell exclusive "pouring rights"
for their campuses to soft-drink companies for millions of dollars,
pushing children to consume empty calories and sugar to improve the
school districts' economic outlook. (The more soda sold on campus,
the larger the school district's bonus in the deal.)</TE>
<TE>   Appealing to Americans' knowledge that we should eat better, the
food industry regularly introduces new products designed to convince
us that foods we know have little nutritional value are suddenly
healthful. Nutrient-fortified Gummi Bears, vitamin-enriched Count
Chocula, low-fat cookies, calcium-added fruit punch: Such products
lull us into a false sense of dietary security, Nestle explains. The
food industry introduces junk food with fewer harmful effects so that
people will eat more.</TE>
<TE>   And we do.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Olestra," one person said about an oil that is neither
digested nor absorbed by the human body and therefore yields no
calories. "It means I get to eat potato chips--the whole bag." That
fortified junk food is still junk food is a distinction that food
marketers would prefer you not make.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, industry groups such as the National Dairy Council, the
American Egg Board and the National Cattlemen's Beef Assn. spend
millions of dollars to influence nutritional advice given by the
government in the form of the Food Pyramid and dietary guidelines
issued by the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services.
"Eat more" is the message proclaimed by these groups, and no expense
is spared to get across that message.</TE>
<TE>   In her exhaustive account, Nestle also examines dietary
supplements--vitamins, botanicals and other products on health-food
shelves--looking at how little that industry is regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing how you're being manipulated can reduce the effects, and
Nestle makes simple suggestions for how we might reverse some of
these trends. Most important, she makes clear the need for better
nutritional education among consumers. "Voting with [our] forks" for
a healthier society, Nestle shows us, is within our power.</TE>

<LD>"What's going on?" I asked the man in a white collar, after I read in
the paper about trouble in the church.</LD>
<LD>   He said, "The Devil made me do it."</LD>
<LD>   It was a smoking gun, so I decided to go to visit the Devil,
a.k.a. Satan, and check it out.</LD>
<TE>   I found him in Hades, making junk calls to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew you were evil, but I never believed you would stoop so low
as to make junk calls."</TE>
<TE>   He chortled and said, "The Devil does a lot of things that no one
knows about."</TE>
<TE>   "Can we talk?" I asked. "They say you made some priests in the
church do some really terrible things."</TE>
<TE>   He had a triumphant look on his face.</TE>
<TE>   "This will teach the angels in heaven a lesson."</TE>
<TE>   "But why attempt to destroy so many fine men?"</TE>
<TE>   "It was a quiet day, so I thought I would cause some mischief."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not enough reason. Do you realize you've cost the church
millions of dollars in hush money?"</TE>
<TE>   "They should have thought of that when they made a pact with me,"
Satan said.</TE>
<TE>   "You made a pact with the priests?"</TE>
<TE>   "Only those who were tempted in the first place. They were heading
straight to hell anyway."</TE>
<TE>   "What if the church decides to let priests marry? Would you try to
stop that?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, because the Devil can break up any marriage he wants. I've
done it before and I'll do it again."</TE>
<TE>   "You have no pity."</TE>
<TE>   "Why should I? I am the king of the underworld. Anyone who messes
with me better fasten his seat belt."</TE>
<TE>   "What's in it for you?"</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm trying to do is raise hell. If I can't, who can?"</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure you are not picking on innocent clergymen?"</TE>
<TE>   "I only pick on one when I'm sure the church is paying off a young
man for something the priest did, and then the bishop moves him to
another parish. I know I haven't made a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you get caught and punished for all your sins."</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't dare."</TE>
<TE>   "Can they exorcise you from those people in trouble?"</TE>
<TE>   The Devil laughed. "They keep trying all the time, with little
success. I am the Prince of Darkness, and the root of all evil. That
is why I'm giving Rome such a bad time."</TE>
<TE>   "I better go," I said. "It's getting too hot down here."</TE>
<TE>   He said, "I hope you write about me. I need the publicity."</TE>

<LD>You may know about bagels or jalapeno peppers, but I bet you've never
heard of a jalapeno bagel, right?</LD>
<LD>   Well, "Jalapeno Bagels" is the title of a book by Natasha Wing
about a boy named Pablo who is asked to bring something to school
that represents his background.</LD>
<LD>   Coming from a Mexican-Jewish family, Pablo looks for something
that is like him--a mixture of his two cultures. He settles on
jalapeno bagels. What would you bring to school to represent your
family?</LD>
<TE>   Joe Alaskey, the voice of many Looney Tunes characters, will read
"Jalapeno Bagels" at the Skirball on Sunday at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   You can hear the story and enjoy a bagel buffet! You can also
visit Bubbe's Kitchen, a re-creation of a Jewish-American immigrant
kitchen from the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   For reservations for the book reading, call (310) 440-4636. For
general information, call (310) 440-4500 or visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<HD>Where Does It All Go?</HD>
<DH>Following a recycling truck's route turns up truths about
L.A.'s trash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recycling is practically a genetic impulse in my family. My older
sister regularly flies across the country with empty but oozing soda
cans in her purse so she can recycle them at home instead of throwing
them in the trash. My little sister has a worm box to turn her coffee
grounds into compost. Me? No piece of plastic, glass or paper is too
small to salvage. Juice bottle caps, coffee lids, receipts--nothing
induces liberal guilt more quickly for me than throwing them away.</LD>
<LD>   But standing at the sink one day, engaged in a futile attempt to
scrub the almond butter off the insides of a jar, I started to wonder
what was happening to all the newspapers, beer bottles, junk mail and
yogurt containers I threw in my L.A. city-issued big blue recycling
bin each week. I decided to trail my recycling truck to find out.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinarily, the emerald green truck is my alarm clock on Tuesdays
as it slowly snorts its way through the neighborhood around 7 a.m.
But today I am up and waiting, ready to roll. It's 7:25 when the
driver of truck No. 174 wheels up, clasps a robotic arm around my
90-gallon bin and gives it the old heave-ho. He will do this about
900 times today.</LD>
<TE>   I pull out of my driveway to follow him. From the tail end of the
truck, a cartoon with big eyes and waving arms smiles at me, warning
me of three recycling no-no's: No plastic bags. No electronics,
appliances or metals. And no construction debris or wood.</TE>
<TE>   I've already violated one of the rules: plastic grocery store
bags. I have so many of them, I'm convinced they divide and multiply
under my kitchen sink. Like many other plastic items, bags may have
the recycling symbol on them, but they aren't recycled by the city
(you can take them back to the grocery store, however) because they
are not cost-efficient to sort and resell.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing my driver, I notice I'm not the only one breaking the
rules. A broom handle sticks out from one neighbor's bin; dirty
Styrofoam plates flutter out of another. Even though the city does
not recycle these items, the truck swallows them up. Later, they will
be sorted out and added to the pile headed for a landfill.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that about a quarter of what's thrown in the
recycling bins is either not recyclable or not recycled by the city.
Among the items that have come through the system: engine blocks,
clothes, dead animals and garden hoses.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much anything and everything that fits in those bins,
people throw it in," said David Lee, manager of L.A. Recycling Center
on North Main Street downtown.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Recycling, which handles recyclables from my neighborhood and
others, is one of six privately run recycling centers under contract
with the city of Los Angeles. According to Richard Wozniak, head of
the city's recycling division, L.A. has almost 100% participation in
the program.</TE>
<TE>   As I follow my truck as it weaves through the neighborhood, I
notice that only about one in three houses has put out a recycling
bin for pickup. I expect that, like me, those households are
recycling, but don't bother to drag their bin out each week. The
containers can get heavy--they hold up to 250 pounds of stuff.</TE>
<TE>   At about 12:30 p.m., my truck pulls into L.A. Recycling and drives
onto a scale to be weighed before it dumps its load. In a little more
than five hours, it has collected 7,230 pounds and will, by the end
of the day, collect double that amount. (I've never weighed my trash,
but the average L.A. household generates 2,275 pounds of it each
year--and about a quarter of that is recyclable, Wozniak says.)</TE>
<TE>   The city's recycling system is "single stream," which means that
paper, cans and glass are all tossed together into the same recycling
bin. When the city began its curbside program in 1989, residents were
asked to sort their recyclables into two containers--one for paper,
another for plastics, cans and glass. To make the system more
user-friendly and cost-effective, the city switched to single stream
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   As I look over the contents of my truck's morning run, I try to
see if I recognize any of my trash amid the Cheetos bags, lawn
furniture, house plants, Pepsi bottles, egg cartons, salad dressing
bottles and Slim-Fast cans. Could that label-less tin can rolling my
way be the one I recycled? I have no idea. The only sure indication
the trash is even from my neighborhood is the box from Casa Bianca, a
local pizza parlor.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, recyclables are pretty much the same across the
city, the director of the center tells me. "There isn't too much
difference between a load that might come from Beverly Hills or a
load that came from Watts," says Lee. "In Beverly Hills, they might
have a Dom Perignon bottle in there, but in Watts if you have a
bottle of Ripple, who cares? It has the same scrap value."</TE>
<TE>   Truck No. 174's contents are dumped into a big mound that will
later be bulldozed into an even larger pile that will then be fed
onto a conveyor belt.</TE>
<TE>   There, all the stuff that's been commingled will be sorted and
separated in a process that is part hands-on and part mechanized.</TE>
<TE>   The human sorting team--outfitted in particle masks, goggles and
long sleeves--picks out obvious non-recyclable trash such as wire
hangers, wooden planks and plastic bags, all of which can and do jam
the machine for about an hour each workday.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 15 people on the line, each one processing about a
ton of material every hour. It is loud and dusty on the conveyor
belt, but at least it does not smell. Most of what comes down the
line is paper.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Samuel Fuentes, 26, who had been working the line for two
months if he had spied any treasures in the trash. "So far, no," he
says. "But I'm hoping."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever survives this first round of sorting continues on to a
second conveyor belt that separates paper from heavier items.
Underneath it is a chute, through which broken glass tinkles onto the
ground. Cans are jettisoned off into a big metal bin, paper into
another.</TE>
<TE>   Once separated into their respective categories, the goods are
crushed into bales, trucked to San Pedro and, for the most part,
shipped to Asia. There's a market for these recyclables in the U.S.,
but companies here do not pay as much as companies overseas, where
resources are scarcer.</TE>
<TE>   So what will ultimately become of my empty laundry detergent
bottles?</TE>
<TE>   Most likely they will be melted down and transformed into dolls.
My soda bottles will make carpet. Cardboard boxes will turn into egg
cartons and other packing materials.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers will breed other newspapers, cans will make more cans,
glass other glass.</TE>
<TE>   And, the ones that come my way again? I'll toss them in my big
blue bin.</TE>

<LD>"The bridge must have gone down," Ma said. "No one could survive an
accident like that."</LD>
<LD>   Kate put on Pa's slicker again. She grabbed a lantern and lighted
it. "I've got to get help," she said. It's what Pa would have done,
she thought.</LD>
<LD>   "Be careful, Kate," Ma said before Kate hurried out into the
stormy night.</LD>
<TE>   The wind tried to knock her down as she ran across the pasture.
But she pushed forward. Someone had to help the engine crew get out
of the wreck that had just happened. And then she had to stop the
Midnight Express. But she was only a kid. How could she do what most
adults wouldn't try to do?</TE>
<TE>   She ran along the tracks toward the broken bridge over Honey
Creek, swinging the lantern high in hopes the engine crew would see
it.</TE>
<TE>   When she reached the broken bridge, she held up the lantern and
saw the engine lying in the creek bed below. She called into the
darkness and heard a faint voice answering.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you?" she called, swinging the lantern in the air
again, hoping to see better.</TE>
<TE>   "Over here," came the answer.</TE>
<TE>   She followed the sound and turned to some trees nearby. Swinging
the lantern again, she saw two men clinging to some fallen branches
farther down the bank of the swollen creek.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to find help," she called. But the raging wind probably
blew her words away. "I'm going to the train station." She wondered
if the men could hear her. "I'll be back as soon as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the hard part, she thought. How am I going to get to the
station when the bridge is down?</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Kate make it to the railroad station in time to
save the crew and stop the next train?</TE>

<HD>Adelphia to Delay Annual Report</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Cable provider's shares drop 12% on concerns
about loans to family-owned partnerships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s annual report will be delayed while
the sixth-largest U.S. cable television provider reviews accounting
related to $2.3 billion in debt disclosed last week.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia shares fell 12% Monday on concern the company has yet to
provide details on private partnerships that hold the debt or specify
what assets back up the borrowings.</LD>
<LD>   "They need to come out with more disclosure as quickly as
possible," said Jonathan Hatcher, an analyst at Strong Capital
Management Inc., owner of Adelphia stock and bonds. "Anything that
happens without more disclosure is a negative."</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia, controlled by the Rigas family, has lost more than $1.3
billion in market value since Wednesday, when the company revealed it
was the guarantor of loans to family-owned partnerships including
Highland Holdings. Highland, which analysts say owns cable assets and
Adelphia shares, used some of the borrowed money to buy more stock.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive John Rigas said in a statement that
Adelphia recognizes the "desire for greater clarity and transparency"
and is "committed to providing it in a timely manner."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for a 10-K
filing extension, saying it's conducting an accounting review with
outside auditor Deloitte &amp; Touche. Highland Holdings acquired $567.4
million in convertible shares from Adelphia, the company revealed in
an SEC filing in February.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares fell $1.78 to $13.12 on Nasdaq. The stock has
declined 36% since Wednesday to its lowest price in more than four
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigas family's use of company-backed debt to finance the
purchase of Adelphia shares may represent a conflict of interest,
Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Bilotti wrote in a research report.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the $2.3 billion in borrowings held by partnerships,
Adelphia had debt of $14.7 billion at the end of 2001. The company
has disclosed it also may be liable for $500 million in bank loans to
a former telephone unit that filed for bankruptcy last week.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Losing More Clients</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The layoffs are likely to run into the
thousands as the pace of defections from the auditing firm increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm has lost roughly 10% of its U.S.
business since December, and sources say layoffs expected to be
announced soon are likely to run into the thousands.</LD>
<LD>   Company spokesman Patrick Dorton said no final decision has been
made on the timing or number of layoffs at Andersen, which employs
28,000 people in the U.S. But he noted that layoffs became inevitable
after the Justice Department's decision to prosecute the company for
obstruction of justice after employees shredded documents sought last
year in the federal probe of Houston energy trader Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "We will work to accommodate those who remain with Andersen as
well as those who will have to look for new opportunities," Dorton
said.</LD>
<TE>   The firm continued to lose clients Monday, including several large
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Capital Bancorp of Santa Barbara, one of Andersen's larger
bank clients, reversed an earlier decision to stick with the
accounting firm and said in a regulatory filing Monday that it will
seek a new auditor.</TE>
<TE>   SPX Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., industrial products company,
rescinded its selection of Andersen. FirstEnergy Corp., a utilities
holding company based in Akron, Ohio, also said it was reconsidering
its use of Andersen's audit services. And Newell Rubbermaid Inc. said
it will switch to Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with nearly 100 other client defections, Andersen has
lost annual revenue of $400 million to $500 million, according to an
estimate compiled by The Times. In previous years the firm's revenue
topped $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   One senior partner said that the pace of client defections was
increasing for two reasons: Companies were concerned that the firm
was no longer financially viable. They also feared that the loss of
Andersen's partner firms overseas to rival accounting partnerships
will diminish Andersen's ability to conduct global audits.</TE>
<TE>   Senior executives of Andersen Worldwide are scheduled to meet in
London today to name an interim chief executive to replace Joseph F.
Berardino, who announced his resignation last week. In addition,
Andersen's U.S. partners will hold a nationwide teleconference
Thursday to discuss the state of the firm and problems with its
insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Last week Andersen backed out of a March 1 agreement to pay $217
million to settle an Arizona fraud case involving the Baptist
Foundation of Arizona. Andersen blamed its insurance carrier
Professional Services Insurance Co. of Hamilton, Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for investors in the foundation, which Arizona officials
say turned into a Ponzi scheme that cost 11,000 people nearly
$600million, say Professional Services balked at paying the claim
because the U.S. Andersen partnership failed to make a $100-million
premium payment due in January.</TE>
<TE>   They said the carrier has about $700 million in capital but that
the failure by Andersen to make the payment put it in violation of
the capital requirements set by Bermuda insurance regulators.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance firm is owned by the separate partnerships that make
up the Andersen Worldwide network. It faces multiple liabilities
arising from Andersen's work for the Baptist Foundation, Enron and
Global Crossing Ltd., as well as problems with audits by several of
Andersen's overseas partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Himelrick, an attorney for Baptist Foundation investors, said
Andersen still has the cash flow to make the premium payment, a move
that would then lead to the settlement of one of the large claims
against the firm.</TE>
<TE>   A trial in the case, canceled when the settlement deal was
reached, has been scheduled for April 29 in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The pending layoffs and constant erosion of Andersen's client base
come even as former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker tries to
implement a rescue plan for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's plan is dependent on getting the Justice Department to
dismiss or suspend its indictment. He also must reach a settlement
agreement with the class-action plaintiffs who have claims against
Andersen for its Enron work.</TE>
<TE>   One partner observed that each task has gotten increasingly
difficult considering Andersen's diminishing financial position and a
Justice Department backlash against the firm for perceived political
pressure to give Andersen some relief.</TE>
<TE>   He said Andersen's best hope may be in winning the May 6 criminal
trial in Houston, if it can survive the six to eight weeks between
now and the expected end of the trial.</TE>

<HD>Outlook Good for Area Rentals, Report Finds</HD>
<DH>Demand for apartments has dropped slightly, but Southern
California remains one of strongest markets in the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Owners of high-priced apartment complexes have taken some lumps
during the economic slump in Southern California, but the recession
has had less of an effect on moderately priced units and the region
remains one of the strongest in the nation in terms of overall demand
for apartments.</LD>
<LD>   Those are some of the conclusions in a new report that shows
demand has weakened slightly for apartments in the region but ranks
Southern California apartment markets among the top 10 in the country
in terms of how they are expected to perform in the coming year.</LD>
<LD>   The report, issued by Palo Alto-based Marcus &amp; Millichap, says the
vacancy rate for luxury apartments in Irvine has soared to 9.2% and
is expected to peak at 12% during the next year--compared with the 1%
and 2% vacancy rates that prevailed in most of Orange and Los Angeles
counties when the economy was growing.</LD>
<TE>   Vacancies also have climbed at higher-priced apartment buildings
in Los Angeles County, reaching 6.4% in Santa Monica and Marina del
Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Rents are rising at 2% to 3% per year in many high-priced
neighborhoods that were commanding double-digit rent increases during
the economic buildup. Luxury apartments represent approximately the
upper 10% of the apartment units in any market.</TE>
<TE>   Rents rose by as much as 13% in some moderately priced
neighborhoods during 2001, and vacancies generally remained low for
lower-priced apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the higher vacancies and flatter rent growth in the upper
end of the market, Marcus &amp; Millichap forecasts that Orange County
will rank fourth, the Inland Empire fifth and Los Angeles County
sixth in the nation during the next year in terms of demand for
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast is based on a statistical analysis of such factors as
predicted job growth, the number of apartments expected to be built
and the affordability of homes for purchase, said Harvey Green,
Encino-based president of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors indicate that demand will continue to outstrip
supply of apartments in Southern California, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the higher vacancy rates of higher-priced
apartments is that low interest rates have made home buying
competitive with renting.</TE>
<TE>   "In some parts of south Orange County, the rents are about the
same as a mortgage if you have a down payment," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Green said, new construction of luxury buildings
added supply at the same time demand declined as a result of the
economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The new supply includes projects in Orange County as well as "some
unique new high-rise luxury apartment projects on the Westside [of
Los Angeles] that will never happen again," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some blemishes, the picture is positive for the region's
apartment markets, said Green, who is "very bullish" on the region.</TE>
<TE>   Investors share that optimism, said real estate broker Kitty
Wallace of Sperry Van Ness, who specializes in properties in West
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "When a luxury apartment comes on the market, there are still
plenty of buyers," Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 180 apartment buildings were sold in 2001 in the
Westside neighborhoods she specializes in, Wallace said, compared
with 155 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The number of higher-priced buildings that were sold (those going
for more than $150,000 per unit) increased to 68 in 2001 from 43 in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Some Westside apartment owners are offering incentives such as a
month's free rent to attract tenants, said apartment broker Laurie
Lustig-Bower of CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen some move-in specials that we haven't seen since
1995," Lustig-Bower said. "Owners are used to having virtually no
vacancy, and now that some of them have 5% vacancy and it's taking
longer to rent their units, some of them are getting a little
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   But many of the luxury complexes are more than 98% occupied,
Lustig-Bower added, and their owners are not offering any concessions
to prospective tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The recession has produced no noticeable change in the vacancy
rate at the approximately 3,000 San Gabriel Valley rental units
managed by Pasadena-based Beven &amp; Brock, said C. Finley Beven, whose
firm has managed apartments in the San Gabriel Valley for 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our occupancy now is as high as it's ever been," Beven said. The
units managed by the company have been 99% occupied throughout the
last two years, he said, meaning that about 30 of the 3,000 units are
empty at any given time.</TE>
<TE>   Most apartments remain empty only a short time for cleaning or
renovations, Beven said.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Beven said about 100 of the company's units were
empty during the mid-1990s, before the economic recovery of the mid-
and late 1990s boosted demand.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's apartment markets have suffered far less
from the economic slowdown than those in the Bay Area, according to
the Marcus &amp; Millichap report, which ranks San Jose 36th among the 40
markets in its study.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento ranks first in the study, and San Francisco, where some
top-tier rents dropped by 20% to 25% in 2001, ranks 16th.</TE>

<TE>Rents rose faster in moderately priced neighborhoods in Los Angeles
and Orange counties in 2001 than they did in more expensive
neighborhoods, reflecting a weakening in the luxury apartment market.

<LD>SeeBeyond Technology Corp., a maker of software used to link computer
systems, said it won't meet revenue forecasts for the first quarter
because of slowed spending by technology companies.</LD>
<LD>   The Monrovia company said it expects to report revenue of
$42million to $42.5million, compared with the $44.5-million average
forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. The
company also said that it expects to earn 3 cents a share, matching
analyst expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of SeeBeyond fell to as low as $7.35 in after-hours trading
on the announcement. They had closed at $7.97, up 32 cents, on
Nasdaq.</LD>

<HD>Cendant Expanding in California With Purchase</HD>
<DH>Deals: Hotel franchiser agrees to acquire Trendwest
Resorts for $927 million in stock to boost its time-share business in
the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT BURGESS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cendant Corp., the world's largest hotel franchiser, said Monday that
it has agreed to buy Trendwest Resorts Inc. for about $927million in
stock, bolstering its time-share resort business with properties in
California and elsewhere on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Cendant has said it wants to expand its time-share
business to benefit from an aging U.S. population, which is expected
to have more money for travel. Cendant's existing time-share
operations, which it acquired in the last year, are mainly in the
eastern United States.</LD>
<LD>   Trendwest operates resorts in California and other Western states,
British Columbia, Mexico, Hawaii and the South Pacific. Its 48
properties have about 150,000 time-share owners, who buy ownership
rights to a property for a specified period each year.</LD>
<TE>   Cendant will exchange 1.297 to 1.486 of its shares, or an average
of $26.72, for each share of Redmond, Wash.-based Trendwest, and will
assume about $74million in debt in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Trendwest rose 97 cents to $24.99 on Nasdaq, and are up
57% over the last 12 months. Cendant fell 18 cents to $19.02 on the
Big Board.</TE>
<TE>   Trendwest is 80% owned by Jeld-Wen Inc., a Klamath Falls,
Ore.-based manufacturer of windows and doors, which has been seeking
to sell its stake since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The company had revenue of $469.2 million in 2001, compared with
$8.95 billion for Cendant.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will generate about $15million annually through cost
savings and other synergies, and would add 1 cent per share to
earnings in 2002 and 2 cents next year, Cendant said. The company was
expected to earn $1.32 a share, according to IBES International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant owns such hotel chains as Days Inn, Ramada, Howard
Johnson, as well as the Avis rental car and Century 21 real estate
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Its has made more than $6 billion of acquisitions in the travel
business since the beginning of 2000, including travel reservation
company Galileo International Inc. and Cheap Tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The time-share business provided 6% of Cendant's revenue last
year, collecting $390 million in exchange fees. The business is
expected to be one of Cendant's fastest growing in 2002, with revenue
rising 15%, according to Fulcrum Global Partners.</TE>

<HD>Boston, Salt Lake Getting Net-Savvier</HD>
<DH>Internet: Survey of American cities finds most communities
have progressed in making the most of the Web.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Silicon Valley still rules, but an annual survey of America's most
Internet-savvy cities found that Boston and Salt Lake City made huge
strides over the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Boston jumped 12 places to No. 4 in this year's survey, published
in the May edition of Yahoo Internet Life magazine. Salt Lake City
jumped 23 places to sixth, but the magazine said it could be a
one-time spike caused by the recent Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco, San Jose, and Austin, Texas, stayed in the top
three spots, which they've held in all but one of the five surveys.</LD>
<TE>   Don Willmott, the magazine's technology editor, said the biggest
news may be that numbers were up almost everywhere, despite the
recession. It took a score of 36 out of 40 to win this year, up from
33.3.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's getting better," Willmott said.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine uses a formula that measures more than just Internet
use and high-tech jobs to get a sense of which communities make the
most of the Web. Willmott said that analysis includes basic stats,
the extent to which businesses are online and how sophisticated the
users are.</TE>
<TE>   "We measure that by how often they shop and how many have gotten
fast access," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The formula also includes an evaluation of content available in
the area, including a ranking of how well local government uses the
Net. That helped give Boston a boost.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is one of the best city Web sites," Willmott said of
www.cityofboston.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked San Francisco has the highest percentage of households
using the Net (78.8%), is No. 2 in online spending per user ($356)
and in domains per 1,000 firms (4,163), and sixth in broadband use
and interest (54.9%). The data is compiled from Forrester Research
and Matthew Zook of the Internet Geography Project.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine ranks 86 metropolitan areas. Seven of the top 21
areas are in California.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom three this year were Tulsa, Okla., Scranton, Pa. and
Gary, Ind.</TE>

<HD>Covanta Energy Files for Chap. 11</HD>
<DH>Reorganization: Plan includes an agreement to sell itself
to investment firm KKR for $225 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power provider Covanta Energy Corp., weighed down by disparate
holdings such as the management contract for Anaheim's Arrowhead
Pond, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday and agreed to be
acquired after its reorganization for $225 million by investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   Covanta, which changed its name a year ago from Ogden Corp., also
said it will have a difficult time seeking Wall Street financing both
for its entertainment and aviation businesses and its primary energy
and water operations, including municipal waste-to-energy facilities.</LD>
<LD>   The Fairfield, N.J., company listed $3.28 billion in assets and
$3.03 billion in debts in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy papers filed in
Manhattan. The company couldn't meet loan obligations after it failed
to sell unprofitable businesses, including the contracts to manage
hockey arenas in Anaheim and Ottawa, Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for both Anaheim and the company said the
bankruptcy filing will have no effect on the city or on events at the
Pond, home to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks professional hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   "From our standpoint, it is business as usual for everyone at the
Arrowhead Pond," said Tim Ryan, the arena's general manager. "The
important thing is that we continue to book events for the near and
the long-term. We're solidifying some contracts for the year 2006."</TE>
<TE>   The company, through its Ogden Facility Management Inc. unit,
guaranteed payments on debt securities the city issued a decade ago
to build the arena. So far, ticket sales and other revenue have
helped Ogden remain current on monthly interest bills averaging
$500,000 and on the annual principal payment, which was $1.9 million
in December, said John Nicoletti, an Anaheim spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   In Canada, however, shareholders in the Ottawa Senators hockey
team and the Corel Centre recently demanded that Covanta fulfill a
promise to buy $105.5 million in securities, a condition of its 1999
contract to manage that building. Soon after entering that contract,
Covanta directors decided to focus resources on the core energy and
water operations and to sell the entertainment and aviation holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "They made some bad investments that sucked up cash when they
needed it," said Peter Rigby, credit analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   Both Rigby and the company said the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
delayed the sale of an aviation-fueling business and that the
collapse of Enron Corp. made it harder for all power producers to
raise money.</TE>
<TE>   The fiscal crisis in Argentina also foiled Covanta's effort to
sell a casino and an exhibition center it owns in that country, the
company said. But the biggest problem has been the obligations in
Anaheim and Ottawa, said S&amp;P's Scott Taylor. "Their banks just got
tired of the whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   A consortium of more than 20 banks, however, agreed to provide
Covanta with $463 million in post-bankruptcy financing to help the
company reorganize and sell itself.</TE>
<TE>   The nonbinding agreement with a unit of Kohlberg Kravis provides
that Covanta and its bank lenders will work exclusively with the
investment firm for as long as 90 days, Covanta said. KKR would
acquire Covanta after completing research and negotiating a
definitive agreement. The acquisition would follow court approval of
a reorganization plan.</TE>
<TE>   Covanta said on Dec. 24 that it had limited cash available and was
negotiating with bank lenders, causing its stock price to plummet
60%. The company blamed the cash crunch on delays in payment for
power sold in California, as well as on its inability to sell its
aviation and entertainment businesses.</TE>
<TE>   A month ago, Covanta missed a $4.6-million payment on $248.7
million of bonds and said it was negotiating with creditors to
restructure the debts.</TE>
<TE>   Trading in Covanta shares was halted Monday on news of the
bankruptcy filing. The stock last traded at 72 cents a share on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James S. Granelli contributed to this report,
and Bloomberg News was used in compiling it.</TE>

<LD>California regulators have taken a key step toward regulating
high-speed Internet access over phone lines, a service that has grown
fast but left a rash of complaints in its wake from Internet service
providers and frustrated consumers.</LD>
<LD>   A California Public Utilities Commission judge ruled late last
week that the agency has the authority to weigh in on a range of
issues involving the Internet access technology known as digital
subscriber line service, or DSL, including the quality of service
provided, how it is marketed and a provider's DSL business practices.</LD>
<LD>   "Finally, consumers have a place to go when they are having
problems with their DSL service," said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a consumer group
based in San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   "The decision is a big deal in the sense that it has a
precedential impact nationally ... so I think we'll see a trend of
states taking a bigger role in DSL issues."</TE>
<TE>   PUC officials were not available to discuss the implications of
the DSL ruling because government offices were closed Monday for a
state holiday.</TE>
<TE>   The commission has been gearing up to address DSL matters for
almost two years, ever since it was flooded with complaints from
customers of SBC Pacific Bell's DSL service. In the spring of 2000,
installation and order mix-ups were rampant, with customers
exasperated over lost orders, no-show technicians and lengthy service
delays. PUC officials complained at the time that they didn't have
enforcement measures in place to act aggressively to protect
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the PUC and sister agencies in other states have
steadily increased their oversight of DSL, a service that allows
users to access the Internet at high speeds over regular phone lines
without disrupting phone calls. It has become an important service
for residential and small-business users, and a critical and
lucrative market for phone companies, which want to book the extra
revenue and beat cable companies selling a rival Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, a spate of bankruptcies involving DSL providers
has added to the state's concern because some customers have been
left stranded with no service and without enough notice to find a
replacement carrier.</TE>
<TE>   PUC Commissioner Carl Wood is considering including consumer
protections for DSL customers in his proposed telecommunications
consumer bill of rights. Earlier this year, the PUC launched an
investigation into DSL billing problems and other service quality
issues at SBC PacBell, a unit of SBC Communications Inc. and the
state's dominant DSL provider and local phone company.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell does not disclose how many DSL customer it has, but
experts put the figure at more than 700,000 in California, or more
than half of its 1.3 million nationwide subscriber base.</TE>
<TE>   The installation troubles at SBC PacBell eventually subsided, and
although complaints continue about billing and other matters, they
are generally at a lower rate than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC judge's ruling last week came as part of a complaint case
brought by the California ISP Assn. against SBC PacBell and its
affiliates. The complaint, filed in July, outlined policies and
contract terms that the group says gives an unfair advantage to SBC
PacBell and the company's own Internet service provider over
unaffiliated ISPs.</TE>
<TE>   SBC PacBell sought to have the complaint dismissed, arguing that
the state did not have jurisdiction over DSL matters in the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC judge ultimately agreed that it could not regulate pricing
or the terms and conditions of the company's DSL offering, but found
that the state has clear jurisdiction over the related quality of
service, marketing and business practice matters.</TE>
<TE>   John Britton, a spokesman for SBC PacBell, said the company does
not discriminate against unaffiliated ISPs.</TE>

<HD>Latest Economic Reports Suggest Robust Recovery</HD>
<DH>Growth: Analysts say spurts in manufacturing and
construction spending signal revival's staying power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing rose in March as firms boosted production to meet
the strongest demand in nearly 15 years while construction spending
jumped in February, two separate reports said Monday, bolstering
forecasts for robust first-quarter economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management's monthly purchasing managers'
index rose in March to 55.6, the highest level since February 2000
and its second straight month of growth.</LD>
<LD>   That was up from 54.7 in February and beat forecasts for the index
to remain unchanged.</LD>
<TE>   Through January this year the manufacturing sector, which makes up
one-sixth of U.S. economic activity, suffered an 18-month
contraction, its worst since the 1990-91 recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The manufacturing sector is coming back very nicely," said Alan
Ruskin, research director at 4Cast Ltd., an economic consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Any figure above 50 in the index suggests growth; a reading below
50 indicates declining activity.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the rise in activity, the ISM report also indicated that
factories were continuing to shed employees as they have since
mid-2000, while prices spiked higher after the recent run-up in
commodity prices to eight-month peaks.</TE>
<TE>   Firms slashing inventories at a record pace helped to shove the
economy into recession starting in March last year.</TE>
<TE>   But with shelves now nearly bare and demand solid, factories have
had to boost production to restock goods this year, giving economic
growth a hefty kick.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report from the Commerce Department said construction
spending jumped 1.1% in February--the strongest pace since February
2001--in a report that showed the building and housing sectors remain
solid because of low interest rates and lean supply of new homes.</TE>
<TE>   The value of new construction in the United States rose to
$879.4billion in February from a downwardly revised $869.7 billion in
January, the Commerce Department said. Construction spending climbed
1.2% over February 2001.</TE>

<HD>Liberty Media Loss Widens to $3.71 Billion</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Liberty Media Corp., the cable-television company controlled by John
Malone, said its fourth-quarter loss widened to $3.71 billion after
it wrote down the value of investments.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was $1.43 a share, compared with a loss of $1.48 billion,
or 57 cents, a year earlier, Liberty said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Liberty's sales rose 10% to $521
million from $473 million.</LD>
<LD>   Englewood, Colo.-based Liberty took charges against earnings last
year of $4.1 billion to write down the value of its investments in
other media companies, including AOL Time Warner Inc. and News Corp.,
the filing said. Advertising sales at those companies and their
rivals declined last year as the U.S. economy slipped into recession.</LD>
<TE>   Liberty Media wrote down the value of its 4% stake in AOL Time
Warner, the world's largest media and Internet company, by $2.1
billion. Liberty wrote down its 18% stake in News Corp., the media
company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, by $915 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Liberty Media rose 1cent to $12.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>4Kids Entertainment Inc., which licenses children's products and
television shows, said fourth-quarter profit fell 74% as revenue from
Pokemon declined.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $2.2 million, or 16 cents, from $8.54 million,
or 65 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 47% to $10.2
million from $19.2 million, the New York- based company said.</LD>
<LD>   As popularity wanes for Pokemon products, 4Kids has been working
with broadcasting companies to increase sales through the television
show, which is the top-rated U.S. children's program, the company
said. The company has agreements to supply Kids WBand Fox
Broadcasting with Saturday morning programming.</LD>
<TE>   4Kids licenses Pokemon cartoon and video game products outside
Asia and also is exclusive licensing agent of Nintendo Co.'s video
games and characters outside Japan through 2005. The company also
licenses the Cabbage Patch Kids products.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of 4Kids fell $1.87, or 9.4%, to $18.05 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MSNBC is courting Phil Donahue to return to television as the host of
a topical prime-time hour.</LD>
<LD>   Although the network would not comment on its search for new
programming, a source close to the negotiations who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Donahue wants to do it but a deal has not
been reached.</LD>
<LD>   Donahue, 66, has been having "ongoing discussions" with MSNBC,
said his spokeswoman, Jill DeVincens. There has been no agreement,
she said.</LD>
<TE>   MSNBC has been struggling in the ratings against its two cable
news rivals, CNN and Fox News Channel. Donahue's daytime show was a
pioneer in the field, and he won nine Daytime Emmy awards for best
talk show host, the last in 1988. Oprah Winfrey's show overtook
"Donahue" in the ratings in the early '90s, and production was
stopped in 1996.</TE>

<HD>Ford to Halt Luxury Truck After Slim Sales</HD>
<DH>Autos: Lincoln sells 379 of the 2002 Blackwood from
November to February, unable to beat rival to showrooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. will end production of the Lincoln Blackwood pickup
after selling fewer than 400 of the luxury trucks, which sport a
carpeted bed and a price tag of more than $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   The Blackwood was delayed five months, missing the chance to beat
General Motors Corp.'s rival Cadillac Escalade EXT to showrooms as
Ford, the second-largest auto maker, tries to rebound from a
$5.45-billion loss last year.</LD>
<LD>   Blackwood sales were hurt because the pickup comes only in black
and lacks full-wheel drive for snowy climates, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's almost as if this were a ballyhooed Broadway show that
opened up and closed the next day after criticism," said Michael
Schmall, managing partner at Planning Edge auto forecasting company.
"It was either a complete misunderstanding of the market or that they
weren't the first entry into such a small niche market."</TE>
<TE>   The Lincoln luxury division sold 379 of the 2002 rear-wheel-drive
pickups from November through February. Analysts predicted sales of
the Blackwood would reach as many as 8,500 for the 2003 model year
beginning in July. Production runs through December.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has built about 1,000 Blackwood pickups since beginning
production last summer at a plant in Claycomo, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also said Monday it is working on a remedy for an engine
defect that is causing oil leaks in some truck models. A head gasket
is causing leaks from some 5.4-liter V-8 truck engines, primarily in
F-Series pickup trucks from the 1999 model year, Ford spokesman Todd
Nissen said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an oil seepage issue," he said. "But it's not something
that's on every engine."</TE>
<TE>   The affected engines also are installed in some Ford Expeditions,
Lincoln Navigators and Econoline vans.</TE>
<TE>   Nissen declined to comment on the number of vehicles that may be
affected by the defect or estimate how much repairs and replacements
could cost the auto maker.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that we're actively working on and expect
additional improvement actions coming in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the year, Ford announced that its F-series pickup
trucks were the best-selling vehicle in the United States in 2001 for
the 20th straight year.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares fell 76 cents to $15.73 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford has declined 44% in
the last 12 months.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Trims Services to Swift</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., which filed the fourth-largest bankruptcy in
U.S. history, will lose a contract to provide $300 million of
services to Swift, a group of global financial institutions.</LD>
<LD>   The Bermuda-based data network operator will sign a new agreement
in which it will no longer be the exclusive data-transport provider
for Swift, a consortium of 7,000 banks that processes $6 trillion in
transactions daily.</LD>
<LD>   The banks withdrew from the five-year contract because of concerns
over Global Crossing's ability to meet obligations, the group's chief
executive said.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing sought protection from creditors in January after
piling up $12 billion in debt amid slumping network demand. Other
customers might back out of agreements with the company, one analyst
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the beginning of an exodus from Global Crossing,"
said Eric Tutterow of Montpelier, Vt.-based KDP Investment Advisors.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing agreed in February 2001 to develop and operate a
network for processing transactions in 196 countries for Swift, the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the uncertainty surrounding Global Crossing, there is no
choice but for Swift and its community to be in control of its
network," Leonard Schrank, the Belgium-based consortium's chief
executive, said in an interview. Schrank declined to name companies
that might get the work Global Crossing won't perform.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing is curtailing services it agreed to provide Swift
as part of the bankruptcy reorganization plan, according to the
company's statement. Renegotiating the contract will lower costs, it
said.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of revenue from Swift could make Global Crossing less
attractive to potential buyers, KDP's Tutterow said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, whose accounting is being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, has a $750-million buyout offer
from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Legere has said at least 40 companies have
expressed an interest in Global Crossing's network of
telecommunications lines, which link 200 cities in 27 countries.</TE>

<HD>Golf Property Firms' Merger a Step Closer to Tee</HD>
<DH>Real estate: National Golf's board approves agreement with
ailing sister American Golf, but hurdles remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving ahead with a controversial business plan, the board of
National Golf Properties Inc. on Monday announced its approval of a
definitive merger agreement with ailing sister company American Golf
Corp. despite the objections of a major National Golf stockholder and
concern among Wall Street analysts.</LD>
<LD>   Combining the two Santa Monica-based companies controlled by Los
Angeles businessman David G. Price would create the country's largest
owner and operator of golf courses and help the companies overcome
immediate financial troubles and long-term competitive pressures,
said supporters of the combination.</LD>
<LD>   American Golf is a privately owned company that leases and
operates most of the courses owned by National Golf, a publicly
traded real estate investment trust.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to make sure that we come out of this with a strong
company," said Charles S. Paul, chairman of National Golf's
independent directors committee and interim chief executive of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, each share of National Golf would be
converted into a share in a newly created company composed of
National Golf and American Golf. Unlike National Golf, which as a
REIT must distribute most of its earnings in the form of dividends,
the new entity would be organized as a traditional public company.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of American Golf, which is owned primarily by Price
and his family, would receive 156,005 shares in the new company; as
many as 100,000 shares of preferred stock that could be converted
into common stock; and $10,000 in cash. In addition, American Golf no
longer would have to repay a $6-million debt owed to Price.</TE>
<TE>   The companies announced the merger proposal in February.</TE>
<TE>   National Golf said it anticipated completing the merger by the end
of the third quarter, though it faces significant hurdles. National
Golf executives must win the approval of shareholders and lenders
while they seek to postpone and restructure some maturing loans and
seek an infusion of new equity.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sakwa, real estate industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, said
there was not enough information available to determine how National
Golf shareholders would be affected if new investors were brought on
board.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are an existing shareholder ... you have the potential
risk of dilution down the road," said Sakwa, who maintained his
"sell" rating on the company stock. "There are still a lot of
questions that didn't get answered."</TE>
<TE>   Sakwa said National Golf, which owns more than 130 properties
nationwide, has yet to provide an adequate picture of American Golf's
financial performance. Some investors repeated their concerns that
National Golf would assume the problems of American Golf to the
benefit of Price and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still solving the significant problems of American Golf
on the backs of the equity holders of National Golf," said Carl Tash,
chief executive of Cliffwood Partners, a Brentwood investment firm
that owns about 9% of National Golf stock. "American Golf should
clean up its balance sheet first. We still oppose the transaction."</TE>
<TE>   The companies' problems began last year after eroding revenue at
American Golf put it and National Golf technically in default on many
of their loans. American Golf later notified National Golf that it
would miss rent payments, the major source of income for National
Golf. American Golf missed payments for February of this year and
part of January but paid rent due in March, said Paul, the interim
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said he anticipated no major changes at American Golf, which
manages more than 300 private and public courses. Shares of National
Golf fell 23 cents to $7.17 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Jupiter Media Is Low on Money</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jupiter Media Metrix, the technology analysis and Internet audience
measurement firm, said Monday that it has only enough money to cover
its operating expenses for the next few months. The firm also said
that its auditor has questioned its viability.</LD>
<LD>   In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the New York-based company said it holds just $7.5 million in cash
and equivalents, along with $1.4million of marketable
securities--enough to hold it until the middle of the second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company said its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, found "that because
of operating losses and a working capital deficiency, there is
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern."</LD>
<TE>   Jupiter spokeswoman Susan Hickey said Jupiter had retained
financial advisor Robertson Stephens Inc. to help it weigh survival
options. Those options include seeking a strategic investor in the
company and selling one or more of the company's four business units.</TE>
<TE>   The four units are its technology research arm, Jupiter Research;
its Internet traffic measurement unit, Media Metrix; online
advertising measurement operation, AdRelevance; and its European
research and measurement arm.</TE>
<TE>   Hickey said it was unlikely Jupiter will continue to operate in
the future as it exists today.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Jupiter canceled its proposed $71.2-million merger
with NetRatings Inc. after the Federal Trade Commission warned that
it would challenge the proposal. Jupiter said it "wasn't in a
position to contest the FTC in a lengthy court challenge."</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Jupiter Media said it might have to cut its
operations if it didn't get additional funding.</TE>
<TE>   Jupiter said the Nasdaq Stock Market placed it on notice that its
stock will be delisted by June, because its shares have traded well
below the minimum $1 price for more than 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   In trading Monday, Jupiter's stock slumped 5 cents, or 25%, to 15
cents per share.</TE>

<HD>Young Couple Need to Take Baby Steps Financially</HD>
<DH>With a small income, parents-to-be are advised to pay debt,
buy insurance before saving for long term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM WITHERALL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brendan and Catherine Hodge went from carefree college kids to adults
with big responsibilities in a hurry.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating from a small Ohio liberal arts college last
spring and moving across the country to Canoga Park, the couple
married in June. They are expecting their first child in two months.</LD>
<LD>   Some new concerns have arrived with the dramatic changes. They
want to stretch an already tight budget to allow the mother-to-be to
quit her job and stay home with their child. The couple wonder
whether they should begin saving for their child's college education
and building their own retirement accounts. In addition, they want to
start setting aside money to move from a small apartment into a home
of their own.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to take some very careful decisions to stay afloat and
get ready for our first baby," said Brendan Hodge, who grew up in the
San Fernando Valley. He noted that this child is likely to be the
first of several.</TE>
<TE>   "We both want to have a large family. We're hoping for four to six
children."</TE>
<TE>   The Hodges, both 23, are in the kind of financial condition that's
not uncommon for young people starting careers. They owe $45,800 in
college, car and credit card debt. With just a few hundred dollars in
the bank and $2,600 in stocks and mutual funds, the Hodges have a
negative net worth of nearly $43,000.</TE>
<TE>   That deficit doesn't figure to shrink in a hurry. Brendan Hodge's
salary at a small cosmetics company recently jumped to $40,000 from
$28,000 after he was promoted to business manager. But the raise
amounts only to what his wife now makes working part time in a
bookstore and as a stage manager for local theater companies--and she
intends to leave those positions next month.</TE>
<TE>   "Our mothers were both home for most of our childhoods, and we'd
like the same for our children," said Catherine Hodge, who grew up in
Cincinnati. "And we were both home-schooled, and we'd like to do that
for our children too."</TE>
<TE>   Given the couple's circumstances, they need a financial reality
check, said Manhattan Beach-based financial planner Preston Caves.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a typical problem for young people," he said. "You have
a lot of goals, but you don't have the resources to meet them."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, their income is fully stretched. Rent, utilities,
groceries, car insurance and car and college loan payments usually
consume their paychecks. Thinking about retirement, college funds and
a house nest egg is laudable, but those goals must be put on hold
while they tackle more immediate needs, Caves said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to build a financial foundation," he told the couple.
"You need to cover your risks and get into a positive cash flow
before you can start thinking about the other things."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the Hodges should concentrate on paying down some
of their debt, beginning with the high-interest-rate items first.
These include a $1,500 credit card bill at 15% and a $7,800 car loan
at 11.25%.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to tuck away retirement or other savings that might grow at
5% or 7% while carrying balances on debts with more than double that
interest rate is folly, Caves pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Caves suggested that the Hodges cash out of a few stocks worth
$800 that Brendan Hodge accumulated in college to make an immediate
dent in the credit card bill.</TE>
<TE>   And as the family soon will be relying solely on one income, Caves
is concerned that the father-to-be doesn't have life or disability
insurance. Neither is offered through his 15-employee company, and
the couple haven't investigated those policies on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, of course, is where to find the money to pay down
debt or buy insurance. Their budget already is pretty lean--meals out
are extremely rare, they don't take vacations, and they have no
expensive hobbies.</TE>
<TE>   But after reviewing their expenses, Caves identified a couple of
areas that could free up some cash. An $80 monthly cell phone
contract could easily be cut in half. And their $250 monthly car
insurance could be reduced by raising their $250 deductible or
shopping for more economical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "The way it is now, your cars are better insured than you two
are," he told them. "With a child coming, you need to insure
Brendan's life and his earning power."</TE>
<TE>   Given Brendan Hodge's youth and good health, the savings from
those items might be enough to cover bare-bones term life insurance
and disability insurance policies.</TE>
<TE>   But trimming car insurance and cell phone costs only nibbles at
their financial problem. The Hodges need to think about bigger moves,
Caves said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're very conscientious about not spending too much money, but
Los Angeles is an expensive place to live," he said. The couple,
however, plan to stay in the L.A. area. Brendan Hodge is close to his
family, and proximity is all the more important now with his father
going through some medical problems.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is that Catherine Hodge reconsider her plan to
quit work when their baby arrives. Caves wondered whether she could
continue at the bookstore evenings or weekends while her husband is
at home with the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "You may not get to see each other quite as much, but at least you
could pay down some debt and get some savings in place," Caves said.
Her income could provide a small financial cushion that would help
cover the additional expenses a child brings.</TE>
<TE>   As another option, the couple might consider selling one of their
cars to eliminate a $200 monthly car payment and the expenses
associated with operating a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that the Hodges really have only two choices:
earn more or spend less.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't get over the hump and get into a positive cash flow
situation, you end up living month to month and you can't even start
thinking about longer-term financial goals," Caves said. "Saving for
a home isn't feasible right now. You just need to work through this
and get some momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Hodge acknowledged that quitting work might not be the
best move. She has earned money as a proofreader before and said she
might explore whether returning to that line of work from home is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   And she's not too worried about delaying the couple's longer-term
goals, such as chipping into retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're young and we've got time on our side for that kind of
thing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband acknowledged that the next couple of years could be
lean, but he remains optimistic about their financial future. He
expects his earning power to grow, providing the cash to pay off
debts and begin saving money.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my career prospects are pretty darn good for someone my
age," he said. "I'm on a management track. We've just got to figure
our path for the next couple of years."</TE>

<HD>Techs Up, Blue Chips Slip on Mideast News</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Upbeat economic reports send bond yields higher.
Oil-related shares extend their recent rally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing violence in the Middle East sent stock prices reeling
early Monday, but a rally in tech shares, and more positive economic
signals, lifted the market off its lows.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 41.24 points, or
0.4%, at 10,362.70, recovering from an early drop of nearly 140
points.</LD>
<LD>   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index was down 0.85 of a point, or 0.1%, at 1,146.54. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 17.27 points, or 0.9%, to 1,862.62 as tech
shares rose in late trading.</LD>
<TE>   Losers led winners by about 7 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 5 to 4 on Nasdaq. Trading was light in the wake of the Easter
and Passover holidays. Most European markets were closed Monday for
Easter.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks started off sharply lower on concerns about rising tension
between Israel and the Palestinians. But several major tech companies
rebounded in the afternoon on growing sentiment that the sector was
close to bottoming out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was very impressive," Larry Rice, chief investment
officer at Fahnestock &amp; Co., said of the afternoon comeback. "I don't
want to play down the events of the Middle East, but our market
turned in a very strong closing. I think there's some indication that
the tech stocks are bottoming out."</TE>
<TE>   Leading semiconductor maker Intel rose 76 cents to $31.17, Cisco
Systems rose 59 cents to $17.52 and Sun Microsystems gained 70 cents
to $9.52.</TE>
<TE>   Investors initially brushed off reports released Monday morning
that gave more positive signs about where the economy was heading.
But by afternoon, the economic news appeared to be taking hold. The
Institute for Supply Management said its index of business activity
rose more than expected in March to 55.6. An index above 50 signifies
growth in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   And the government said construction spending rose by a
larger-than-expected 1.1% in February, the biggest jump in a year.</TE>
<TE>   The upbeat economic news sent bond yields higher. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed from 5.39% last week to 5.43%
on Monday--its highest level since last May.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Two widely held stocks were downgraded by major brokerages.
Prudential Securities cut Ford to "sell" from "hold," and Merrill

<HD>Film Toys Getting Thumbs Down</HD>
<DH>Retail: The market for movie-based items has cooled.
Merchants are left holding the bag.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Movies for children and families are among Hollywood's hottest
properties. But to the dismay of many studios, toys based on these
movies are getting the cold shoulder from consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Kids, bombarded with toy pitches for just about every movie and TV
show they know, haven't been buying enough of them. That has left
retailers with loads of leftover Star Wars light sabers and unwanted
Pocahontases.</LD>
<LD>   The 1990s were littered with movie toy disappointments--some
failing with the films that spawned them, others sinking on their
own. Losers included toys associated with "Hook," "The Last Action
Hero," "The Flintstones," "Casper," "Congo," "Dragonheart" and most
notably the "Star Wars" prequel, "Episode I The Phantom Menace."</LD>
<TE>   With those and other toy fiascos fresh in their minds, retailers
now are more careful in choosing movie toys. Toy makers, in turn, are
making fewer film-based characters, games and mementos.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel Inc., the nation's biggest toy maker, cut its licensed toy
lines by 25% in the last two years, opting to make more original toys
instead of weaker film-based games and products.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not replicating scenes from a movie anymore," said Matt
Bousquette, president of Mattel's boys/entertainment division. "When
we make movie toys, we're making great toys inspired by a movie."</TE>
<TE>   The cutback in movie-related toys comes just when Hollywood
studios need the promotional value of toys more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   A trend toward more family-oriented entertainment, which has been
growing in the last few years, only intensified after Sept. 11 as
Americans began spending more time at home and with family. And as
more consumers turned to what they saw as wholesome amusements,
including craft making and playing board games, the film industry saw
gentle, nonviolent children's fare surge as well.</TE>
<TE>   In response to consumer and political pressure, many studios also
have worked hard to pare down their R-rated releases.</TE>
<TE>   During 2001, only 27% of ticket sales came from R-rated films,
down from 35% the year before.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, five of the six highest-grossing films
were family fare: "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"--the year's
leader with more than $300million in domestic ticket sales--"Shrek,"
"Monsters, Inc.," "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"
and "The Mummy Returns," each of which brought in more than $200
million in North American ticket sales through December.</TE>
<TE>   Toys and tie-ins involving fast food or other products help offset
rising marketing and production costs of such movies. Manufacturers
and retailers help promote films by advertising their movie-related
products. These products also generate additional income for studios
through royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Toy industry people say wildly popular movies with strong
supporting toys always will sell. Toys based on "Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone," for example, were among last year's hottest
sellers. Those included Lego's Hogwarts Castle and Mattel's Professor
Snape's Potions Class, a cast-your-own-spells toy.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated earnings for the Warner Bros. release offer a good
reason for Hollywood's interest in toys. Salomon Smith Barney
projected $400 million to $500million in sales of "Harry
Potter"-related merchandise, resulting in a profit of $80 million to
$100 million for AOL Time Warner Inc., the studio's parent company.
The "Potter" merchandise largely includes toys, novelties, games,
paper goods and other children's play items, as is typical for
merchandising based on family films.</TE>
<TE>   The "Harry Potter" numbers, however, are hardly typical.</TE>
<TE>   The Good Old Days Have Dried Up</TE>
<TE>   Al Ovadia, executive vice president of Sony Pictures Consumer
Products, fondly recalled days when he could routinely promise studio
executives $15 million or $20 million in profit from consumer product
licenses. Now, he said, those opportunities are few and far between.</TE>
<TE>   The harder line from toy makers and manufacturers is also changing
what toys appear on shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than making toys inspired by the newest and most inventive
children's films, movie toys are more likely to be based on sequels,
TV shows and remakes. In a recent review of 2002 movie-related toy
lines, trade publication the Licensing Letter found that 73% were
based on familiar properties, such as this summer's films
"Spider-Man," "Stuart Little 2," "Scooby Doo" and "Birth of the Pink
Panther."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood studios' power with the toy industry mostly
started--and ended--with "Star Wars."</TE>
<TE>   Between the original 1977 "Star Wars" movie and the 1999 release
of "Episode I The Phantom Menace," fans bought about $4.5billion
worth of "Star Wars" merchandise, a large portion of which were toys.
In between, consumers continued to surprise the studios and toy
makers with their appetite for movie-related products.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co.'s "Lion King," however, went beyond any product
tie-in in history. Within just more than a year of its release, "Lion
King" generated more than $300million in toy sales alone--and more
than $1 billion in sales of all licensed products.</TE>
<TE>   It was then that the studios saw a new pot of gold at the end of
the movie rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   More resources flowed into consumer products departments and more
money was expected to come back out.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news was that the consumer products people were treated
as professionals and taken seriously and were given input," said
Marty Brochstein, executive editor of the Licensing Letter. "The bad
news was that it became 'planned income' in a business that is not
always prone to being plannable. This isn't packaged goods. You can't
always have tight forecasts; you're dealing with consumer culture."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the toy companies were continuing to sign on. In the rough
world of toy making, with thin margins and countless players vying
for the year's big hit toy, a company can fold after just one holiday
season of poor sales.</TE>
<TE>   So, eager to latch onto a solid seller--and to deny those sales to
a competitor--toy companies in the 1990s began bidding up the toy
licenses on even minor movie titles.</TE>
<TE>   "We all got ourselves on a licensing spiral where we all signed
everything there was for fear of missing something," said Warren
Kornblum, chief marketing officer for Toys R Us Inc. "Everybody [was]
chasing a dream, and no one [was] making any money doing it. The
manufacturers weren't. The retailers certainly weren't."</TE>
<TE>   In part, that was because studios raised royalty rates on their
biggest potential blockbusters, increasing the percentage they would
get from the sale of each item. They also began raising "guarantees,"
upfront payments toy makers had to make even if the movie bombed and
the toys didn't sell.</TE>
<TE>   Learning From Some Painful Lessons</TE>
<TE>   In part as a result of earlier failures, toys associated with more
recent children's films--including "Monsters, Inc.," from Disney and
Pixar Animation Studios, and DreamWorks/PDI's "Shrek"--got a far
softer sell and much less time on toy sellers' shelves. The more
cautious approach meant more limited sales, retailers and toy makers
said, even though "Monsters" toys in particular sold reasonably well.</TE>
<TE>   Still, toy makers from around the globe bet the new "Star Wars"
prequel of 1999 would be the surest of sure things.</TE>
<TE>   Hasbro Inc. landed the deal with an eye-popping bid, reportedly
giving director George Lucas an upfront royalty guarantee of
$600million and a 7.4% stake in the company. Royalty rates on the
products were believed to be in the 18%-to-20% range, much higher
than the typical 12% to 13%.</TE>
<TE>   And though the movie generated about $300 million in toy sales, it
wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to make back its investment, Hasbro made and shipped
more product to stores, people in the industry said. That left
retailers to hold "Star Wars" fire sales, taking a big hit to profit.</TE>
<TE>   From there, what Brochstein calls "post-'Star Wars' stress
disorder" began setting in. Suddenly, movie properties weren't as hot
as they used to be.</TE>
<TE>   At Mattel, Bousquette and Mattel Chief Executive Robert Eckert
demonstrated their desire for a new relationship with Hollywood in
late 2000, when they dumped their rights to the newer movie
properties from Disney, the onetime licensing king.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the studio's high fees meant annual sales of
$100million to $150 million a year were not enough to make the deal
profitable for Mattel, which kept rights to the better-performing
classic Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   In response to toy companies' withdrawal, studios cut their
guarantees and promised to share the risk in order to get toys made.
Many studios added their own marketing dollars to push their films'
toys.</TE>

<HD>Crude Oil Hits 6-Month High</HD>
<DH>Energy: Mideast violence pushes futures prices up 8% in a
week. Analysts see little relief at the pump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil futures prices hit a six-month high Monday and retail gasoline
prices continued to rise, amid fears that escalating Middle East
violence would squelch petroleum supplies.</LD>
<LD>   The May contract for West Texas intermediate crude, the U.S.
benchmark, bumped briefly above $27 before closing at $26.88 a
barrel, up 57 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   The last time oil was this expensive was the week after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. Oil prices have jumped nearly 8% in the last
week as a series of suicide bombings brought the biggest military
response by Israel in decades.</LD>
<TE>   Even before the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
oil prices had been rising because of fears of a possible U.S. attack
on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Crude oil supplies are not directly at risk due to the Israel-
Palestinian conflict; however, there could be a spillover effect if
more countries become involved," said George Clemen, an analyst with
Oil-gasoline.com.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq called Monday for Arab states to use oil as a weapon to
punish countries supporting Israel and to stop the Jewish state's
current military action against Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said
any action by Iran would depend on the collective decision of Islamic
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "If they decide to use oil as a weapon, it would be very
effective," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists continued to pay ever-higher pump prices, and analysts
see little relief ahead as the reviving economy keeps demand high and
the summer driving season approaches.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. average price for self-serve regular gasoline reached
$1.371 a gallon Monday, up 2.9cents from last week but down 7.1cents
from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration's
weekly survey of 800 service stations.</TE>
<TE>   Californians paid $1.592 a gallon on average, a 3.1-cent increase
from last week. A year ago, the California average was 12.4 cents
higher.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles drivers saw prices rise 2.4 cents to $1.567 a gallon,
and San Francisco drivers got a 5.8-cent increase to $1.632 a gallon,
reported the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   "California has plenty of gasoline physically, so the prices
shouldn't be going up, but the futures prices are going out of
control," said Mark Mahoney, an analyst with Oil Price Information
Service, a Lakewood, N.J., company that tracks gasoline prices
nationwide. "No one wants to be caught short in this market."</TE>
<TE>   California refineries do not use much oil from the Middle East,
instead processing primarily Alaska and California crudes. Even so,
the state's gasoline market is being affected by movements in world
oil prices, said Carol Thorp, spokeswoman for the Automobile Club of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Pump prices in California generally are higher than those of other
states because of the relative lack of competition in gasoline
refining and marketing and because the state's cleaner-burning
gasoline, mandated by air-quality regulations, is produced by few
refineries outside of California, Thorp noted.</TE>
<TE>   Refinery problems and a switch to more expensive summer gasoline
also boosted prices in the state, analysts said. But the unexpected
problems have been fixed and most refineries are wrapping up routine
winter maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "Gasoline prices are still below where they were a year ago, but
they're going up faster," Thorp said. Prices in the Los Angeles-Long
Beach area have leaped 60% since the beginning of the year, Auto Club
surveys have found. In addition, national AAA surveys find more
motorists planning road trips this summer, which could boost demand,
further increasing the pressure on prices, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of unknowns here," Thorp said. The Auto Club is
monitoring refinery production to determine whether refiners will
keep up with demand or will produce at lower levels to keep prices
high, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Wall St. Sees Dreary Spring for Retail Stocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major brokerage on Monday issued a downbeat view of retail stocks
as two key companies reported disappointing sales.</LD>
<LD>   Most large retail stocks fell after Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. predicted
the end of the sector's bull market.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Federated Department Stores Inc. on
Monday reported weaker-than-expected sales for the last week of
March.</LD>
<TE>   Several analysts predicted poor industry sales for both March and
April, a result of bad weather in much of the country in March and a
calendar shift for April, which compares April sales this year with
the period that a year ago included Easter buying.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales at Wal-Mart and its Sam's Club unit were below
forecasts in the week ended Friday, Wal-Mart said in a recorded
message to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Federated, parent of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, said on a
recorded call that March sales were below its forecast of unchanged
to a decrease of 1% because same-store sales in the week ended
Saturday missed projections.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart fell $1.74 to $59.56, and Federated lost $1.54 to $39.31,
both on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard &amp; Poor's retail
index lost 2%, its biggest one-day drop in about a month.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch's advice to investors to reduce holdings of retail
stocks came even as the brokerage has gotten more bullish on the
economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for retail, Merrill said, is that apart from a few
firms, such as Kohl's Corp., and turnaround stories, such as J.C.
Penney Co., an economic turnaround probably means that profits in the
industrial sector, which have lagged in the last two years, soon will
outpace those of retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than leading the market, Merrill analysts said, retail
stocks could just match the slight gains predicted for the rest of
the market. The brokerage cut its rating on the retail industry to
"average weight" from "overweight."</TE>
<TE>   "The party's over; go home," said Angela Kohler, portfolio manager
at Federated Investment Management, which has about $180 billion in
assets. "There are probably better places to park your money than
retail."</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P retail stocks index, which through last week had soared
43% from its Sept. 21 low, now trades for about 27 times estimated
2002 earnings per share, compared with about 22 times for the S&amp;P
500. That made it just a matter of time before the shine began to
wear off retail stocks, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's chief economist, Bruce Steinberg, said the U.S. economy
is exceeding "even our optimistic expectations." He expects gross
domestic product to rise 3.2% this year, about half a percentage
point higher than his previous forecast.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a class-action investor
lawsuit that accused Bank of America Corp. of hiding losses that led
to a $372-million write-off.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America agreed in February to a $490-million settlement.
That accord is awaiting approval from a federal judge. The Supreme
Court appeal came from a law firm that sought to open a new front by
pressing a separate shareholders' suit in California state court.</LD>
<LD>   The fight centers on a $1.4-billion payment that BankAmerica
Corp., a corporate predecessor of the current company, described as a
loan to New York hedge fund D.E. Shaw &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   The issue for the Supreme Court was whether a federal trial judge
in St. Louis was right to order a halt to the California proceeding.</TE>

<LD>Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed in the
latest auction.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department sold $11 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.79%, down from 1.82% last week. An additional $11
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 2.11%, unchanged
from the week before.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the lowest since March 4, when the bills
sold for 1.76%.</LD>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.821% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,954.30 and 2.163% for a six-month bill selling for $9,893.30.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 2.70% last

<LD>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other underwriters lost a bid to oust
the judge presiding over suits accusing them of rigging initial
public offerings, after an appeals court ruled that the judge's
investments were a minor issue that didn't justify removal.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-nine investment banks, including Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., sought to force U.S.
District Judge Shira Scheindlin to step down from the case, which
accuses the defendants of manipulating hundreds of IPOs. The banks
said she invested in 14 IPOs and lost money in several of them.</LD>
<LD>   "Congress did not consider judges with minor interests in a class
action to be parties to a proceeding once they have divested
themselves of said financial interest," the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals said.</LD>

<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. suffered a court setback in its bid to get
almost $600 million awarded for its stent patents after a federal

<LD>   U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson ruled that Minneapolis-based
Medtronic didn't infringe patents owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson's Cordis

Boston Scientific, although she upheld an infringement verdict.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cephalon Inc. ended a joint venture for marketing two of its drugs
after analysts raised questions about accounting practices involving
the partnership in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Cephalon shares rose $1.63 to $64.63 in Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Cephalon, which makes neurological drugs, formed the joint venture
with two outside investors in December 2001 to invest up to
$50million to market its Provigil narcolepsy drug and Gabitril
treatment for epileptic seizures, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   On Feb. 4, a Sterling Financial Investment Group analyst predicted
more regulatory scrutiny of Cephalon "due to the Enron fiasco,"
citing a newsletter published by accounting expert Howard Schilit
that questioned Cephalon's accounting for joint ventures. Cephalon's
shares fell 13% that day.</TE>
<TE>   Investors didn't like the arrangement because it kept some of
Cephalon's expenses off its balance sheet, said Steven Kirsch, senior
managing director at Sterling Financial.</TE>
<TE>   To end the joint venture, Cephalon acquired the investors'
interests by issuing $55 million in convertible debt. The notes are
convertible into Cephalon's stock, at the option of the holder, at a
price of $70.36.</TE>

<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., the second-largest U.S. bank, agreed to pay
Sumitomo Corp. $125million to settle more than $2 billion in claims
related to copper trades the Tokyo company said were unauthorized.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was the last stemming from lawsuits that Japan's
fourth-largest trading company filed in the U.S. after losing $2.6
billion in 1996 from transactions by its chief copper trader, Yasuo
Hamanaka, Sumitomo attorney Alan Levine said.</LD>
<LD>   Sumitomo accused J.P. Morgan of providing capital to Hamanaka even
though it was aware he was trading without Sumitomo's consent. In May
2000, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to pay Sumitomo $275million in a
similar case.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Baker Hughes Inc., the world's No.3 oilfield-services company, is
facing a second investigation by federal authorities of its business
practices just months after settling a case with similar charges.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission
are investigating the company's operations in Nigeria, the company
said. A former Baker Hughes employee filed suit against the company
last week, claiming he was fired because he wouldn't participate in a
plan to bribe a Royal Dutch/Shell Group unit and win Baker Hughes a
contract in Nigeria. Baker Hughes said it is conducting its own
investigation of the employee's claims.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Baker Hughes settled federal charges in September
that managers illegally authorized $100,000 in payments to government
officials or company agents in India, Indonesia and Brazil. The
company paid no fine and agreed to be subject to tougher sanctions.</LD>
<TE>   Gary Flaharty, a Baker Hughes spokesman, declined to comment
further. John Heine, an SEC spokesman, and Justice Department
spokeswoman Dana Perino declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Baker Hughes shares fell $1.03 to $37.22 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Pacific Shares Fall on Nevada's PUC Claim Ruling</HD>
<DH>Energy: The utility commission will allow $485 million to
be collected. Moody's cuts credit rating to junk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE LAVERTY</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Sierra Pacific Resources, the owner of Nevada's two biggest
utilities, plummeted 40% on Monday after the state denied the
company's claim to recover $437 million in costs triggered by
California's energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Pacific fell $5.98 to $9.11 in New York Stock Exchange
trading of 20.3 million shares, 34 times the daily average over the
last three months. The stock touched a record low of $7.50.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service cut the company's credit rating to junk,
after a similar move by Standard &amp; Poor's Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The company had sought to recoup $922 million it had spent buying
power last year, when electricity prices in the West rose more than
ninefold in the 2001 first quarter from the same time a year earlier,
driven by shortages in California.</TE>
<TE>   But the Nevada Public Utilities Commission agreed to allow Sierra
Pacific to collect just $485 million, over three years.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Fischer, an analyst at brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.,
said the company's quarterly cash dividend may be cut, and the firm
might have to file for bankruptcy protection. "They have contracted
to buy power for this summer at prices that are well above the level
they're recovering in rates," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The energy crisis drove PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric unit
into bankruptcy last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Pacific, the parent of Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific
Power, said it is evaluating its options and declined to say whether
it is considering a bankruptcy filing. "Obviously we would like to
stay away from things that are most extreme but we have to look at
everything, and that's part of what we're doing here in the next few
days," said spokesman Paul Heagan.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, who owns some shares of Reno-based Sierra Pacific shares,
reduced his rating on the stock to "sell" from "hold."</TE>
<TE>   The company paid a 20-cent-a-share dividend in the first quarter.
A year ago it canceled its May 2001 dividend because it needed the
cash to buy power.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Pacific's 8.75% coupon notes maturing in 2005 fell about 10
cents to 90 cents on the dollar, traders said. That pushed up the
yield on the debt to 12.7% from 8.74%.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's lowered Sierra Pacific's corporate credit ratings two
notches to Ba2, its second-highest junk rating, from Baa3, its lowest
investment-grade rating. Moody's changes affect about $3.9 billion in
debt owed by Sierra Pacific and its utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling "comes up well short of what Nevada Power needed to
help stabilize its debt protection measurements, and sets the stage
for a significant write-down which would weaken its balance sheet,"
Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's called the ruling by the Public Utilities Commission a
"stark contrast" to previous actions. "Previous regulatory support
was a significant factor in the prior ratings of Sierra Pacific
Resources and its subsidiaries," Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams Cos. said Monday it will continue to negotiate a
long-term power contract with Sierra Pacific. That's positive news,
said Ronald Tanner, a Legg Mason Wood Walker analyst, who lowered his
rating on the stock to "market perform" from "buy" and doesn't own
the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Pacific agreed March 22 to buy long-term power from Tulsa,
Okla.-based Williams and Reliant Energy Inc. The transaction might
mean an 8.8% rate increase for customers, below the 20% originally
requested.</TE>

<HD>Apollo Will Manage Sunset Project</HD>
<DH>Firm is working to mend relationships with West Hollywood
officials after replacing development's controversial partner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investment firm Apollo Real Estate Advisors has replaced Mark Siffin
as managing partner of the $300-million Sunset Millennium project in
West Hollywood, according to city officials.</LD>
<LD>   The action was taken after Siffin, who had spearheaded the
project's development, angered community leaders and became involved
in a series of costly and embarrassing setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, Apollo officials have been meeting with West
Hollywood city leaders to mend relations and build support for the
mixed-use project, which is in various stages of development along
three blocks of Sunset Boulevard at La Cienega Boulevard.</LD>
<TE>   Apollo executive Richard Ackerman announced last week that his
firm "would be managing the future development of the project," said
West Hollywood City Manager Paul Arevalo.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ackerman nor officials representing Siffin could be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin lost credibility among West Hollywood leaders after
opponents of the project accused the developer of buying the support
of neighbors with hundreds of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Siffin acknowledged financial agreements with some neighbors, but
disputed that they were intended to buy off the project's opponents.
In January, he characterized them as "mutual support and benefits
agreements" that are similar to payments made to cities for the
impacts caused by developments.</TE>
<TE>   City officials also were angered when Siffin reportedly moved to
replace a planned 350-room hotel in the development with housing
without consulting the city. Earlier this year, the West Hollywood
City Council reversed itself and denied Siffin the permit needed to
build giant--and lucrative--billboards atop Sunset Millennium.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing Siffin's replacement as managing partner, Apollo
officials said they were committed to build the hotel as originally
planned. Sunset Millennium also includes 200,000 square feet of
retail space and three office towers, one of which is the former
Playboy Building.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NTT DoCoMo Inc. may write down as much as half its $10-billion
investment in AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. after the third-largest
U.S. wireless company's shares fell by almost two-thirds, analysts
said. AT&amp;T Wireless shares ended last week at $8.95, about 62% less
than what DoCoMo paid for a 16% stake in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   DoCoMo President Keiji Tachikawa has said the world's largest
mobile-phone operator would reassess its AT&amp;T Wireless investment at
the end of the company's fiscal year, which concluded Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T Wireless may account for the bulk of DoCoMo's investment
losses after the company spent almost $15 billion on stakes in rival
phone operators.</LD>

<HD>Qwest Says It May Face SEC Action Over Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said it may be charged by
federal securities regulators for allegedly failing to provide
earnings data in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.</LD>
<LD>   Securities and Exchange Commission staff reviewed Qwest's
fourth-quarter and full-year 2000 earnings news release, the seller
of local and long-distance telephone services said in an SEC filing.
The release provided "pro forma normalized earnings information" that
excluded certain costs related to Qwest's acquisition of US West
Inc., the filing said. The release was issued Jan. 24, 2001. Qwest,
which will have an opportunity to rebut the charge, said in the
filing that it "believes that an action by the SEC would be without
merit."</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Qwest's swaps of capacity on its fiber-optic network
with other telephone companies already are under SEC investigation.
Investors have questioned whether Qwest inflated sales by trading
pieces of its voice and data-transmission system with rivals.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest shares fell 22 cents to $8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Bam's Sales Much Lower Than Forecast</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bam Entertainment Inc., a San Jose video-game software developer that
went public in November, said fiscal third-quarter sales were
significantly lower than forecast and that it has hired an advisor to
help explore "strategic alternatives," including a sale.</LD>
<LD>   Sales in the quarter ended Sunday were $6.5 million to $8.5
million, down from Bam's forecast of $18 million to $20 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company cited delays in new products and lower-than-expected
sales from new titles in the U.S. and Europe. Profit for the fiscal
year ending June 30 is expected to be lower by an unspecified amount.
In January, the company said it expected to be profitable in the
fourth quarter and to have sales of $20 million to $22million.</LD>
<TE>   Bam, which makes games for the Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation
consoles, expects to post a loss for the quarter when it announces
final results in early May. The company said it hired the Jefferies &amp;
Co. investment banking firm, and that it is in preliminary
discussions with several parties, without being specific.</TE>
<TE>   Bam shares fell $1.61, or 34%, to $3.09 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Williams Communications Inc. said it was suspending quarterly stock
dividend payments to cut expenses and was delaying some interest
payments for 30 days.</LD>
<LD>   Ernst &amp; Young, the company's auditor, warned that if Williams is
unable to restructure its balance sheet, lenders may take steps that
could disrupt the telecommunications company's ability to continue as
a going concern.</LD>
<LD>   Ernst based its opinion statement on a notice filed by Williams'
lenders that the company may be in default under the terms of its
credit facility. Williams, which has been exploring the possibility
of seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, plans to take advantage
of a 30-day grace period for interest payments of about $91 million

<HD>HP Won't Reappoint Hewlett to Its Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. withdrew its nomination of Walter Hewlett from
its slate of directors Monday, effectively ousting the dissident
board member who crusaded against the company's pending $19-billion
merger with Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   It's the latest volley in an extraordinary battle between HP and
the son of co-founder William Hewlett. Walter Hewlett, 57, amassed
broad support among shareholders in opposing the merger. Although an
official tally of the March 19 shareholder vote will not be available
for several weeks, HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina has declared a
"slim but sufficient" margin in favor of the merger.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett last week filed a lawsuit alleging that company executives
coerced a large shareholder to endorse the merger and understated the
difficulties in creating what would be the largest computer company
in the world. Hewlett has argued that HP's profitable printer
business would be diluted by Compaq's commitment to the struggling PC
market.</LD>
<TE>   But as late as Thursday, fellow directors were poised to
unanimously renominate Hewlett to its nine-member board. HP director
Sam Ginn said in a statement that the HP board met with Hewlett on
Wednesday. Hours after the meeting, Hewlett filed his complaint in
Delaware Chancery Court.</TE>
<TE>   "My fellow board members and I were ... shocked when just hours
later, Walter Hewlett filed a spurious lawsuit against the company,"
Ginn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett, who controls about 5% of HP shares, said at a rare news
conference two weeks ago that he wished to stay on as an HP director.
He issued a statement Monday expressing disappointment in the board's
nominations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unfortunate that the HP board has seemingly missed what the
company's stockholders have clearly recognized: that dissent is not
disloyalty," Hewlett said. He also reiterated his intent to support
the merger should the final vote come out in favor of the union.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating voter approval, HP and Compaq on Monday issued its
joint slate of candidates for a combined 12-member board, with seven
members from HP and five from Compaq. HP said it would hold a meeting
of shareholders to vote on the list of candidates April 26 in
Cupertino, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hewlett missed a November deadline to become a write-in
candidate in this year's vote, he can petition to be on next year's
slate, said corporate governance experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The family can certainly come back and nominate Walter in 2003,"
said Patrick McGurn, vice president of Institutional Shareholder
Services, an influential advisory firm. "Our position is that we like
dissent in boardrooms. It would have been more interesting if they
had appointed him."</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett has become something of a folk hero to many small
investors who saw his fight as evidence of shareholder activism.
Because of this popularity, HP's decision to oust Hewlett may have
negative consequences, experts and investors said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the post-Enron era, investors are demanding independent
directors," said David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset
Advisors, which owns 613,000 HP shares and 745,000 Compaq shares.
"Clearly, this is a step back."</TE>
<TE>   Nell Minow, editor of watchdog Web site Corporate Library, said HP
would need to work hard to regain the confidence of shareholders who
backed Hewlett against the merger.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a huge burden of proof to demonstrate to the investor
community that they will put someone on who will do a better job than
Walter Hewlett," she said. "It better be somebody really great,
someone who has instant credibility with the community."</TE>

<HD>E-Trade Sued Over GenesisIntermedia Stock Loans</HD>
<DH>Courts: Brokerages are seeking $60 million in the lawsuit
over transactions involving Van Nuys firm's shares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E-Trade Group Inc. revealed that three brokerages are coming after it
for money lost in the collapse of Van Nuys-based Genesis Intermedia
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   E-Trade said it has been sued by three brokerages seeking $60
million in connection with shares it loaned of GenesisIntermedia, a
telemarketer controlled by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.</LD>
<LD>   Nomura Securities Inc., Wedbush Morgan Securities and Fiserv
Securities Inc. allege that E-Trade never returned cash they gave the
online brokerage last year in exchange for shares of
GenesisIntermedia, E-Trade said in its annual 10K report filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   GenesisIntermedia was one of last year's biggest stock flameouts,
and the shares were involved in a flurry of transactions that helped
contribute to the failure of a securities firm.</TE>
<TE>   The stock price jumped from $6 at the start of the year to $25 by
June, boosted in part by a recommendation from Rafi Khan, a
Southland-based stock promoter who previously had been banned from
the securities industry and in 1999 pleaded guilty to tax fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The money-losing company attracted the interest of some investors
for its shopping mall-based Internet-access kiosks.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 25 trading in GenesisIntermedia was halted as the FBI and
the Securities and Exchange Commission probed allegations of stock
manipulation and whether the firm falsified its accounting reports.</TE>
<TE>   The stock was delisted from Nasdaq in January, and has since
traded in the over-the-counter market, where it was quoted at
one-tenth of 1 cent Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Khashoggi's Bermuda-based Ultimate Holdings Ltd. controlled 75% of
GenesisIntermedia's stock when a person, still unidentified, used 7.2
million shares as collateral in a chain of defaulted loans that
reached an estimated $125 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimate Holdings was the only investor that controlled a block of
stock that large, according to SEC filings. The firm has not
commented on the stock's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerages often lend stock to investors who want to engage in
"short selling," which involves borrowing shares and selling them,
betting that the price will decline and that the borrowed shares can
be replaced later for less.</TE>
<TE>   A brokerage that needs such shares for a short-selling client
borrows them from another brokerage in return for a cash loan of 100%
of their value. As the price of the shares fluctuates, the firms
engage in a process called marking the shares to market that is
supposed to equalize the value of the shares and the money loaned.</TE>
<TE>   Stock can be lent from one brokerage to another along a chain.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade lent GenesisIntermedia shares to the three brokerages
after first borrowing the stock from MJK Clearing Inc., then a unit
of Stockwalk Group Inc. Stockwalk filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   MJK ran out of cash after repaying $60 million, which became due
after GenesisIntermedia's trading halt. Native Nations Securities
Inc., which loaned MJK the 7.2 million shares, defaulted on a related
$60 million payment due MJK.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade, in its SEC filing, said it is "confident that E-Trade
Securities has sufficient capital in excess of regulatory
requirements to cover any potential exposure arising from these
matters."</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade hasn't established any reserves or taken any charges in
connection with the lawsuits, said Connie Dotson, the Menlo Park,
Calif.-based brokerage's chief communications officer.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade shares fell 24 cents to $9.18 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Suit Against MGM Mirage Reinstated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News, Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange won reinstatement of a lawsuit accusing
MGM Mirage Inc. of violating copyright laws when it used variations
on the NYSE name in its New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las
Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest stock market sued to stop MGM Mirage, the
world's second-largest gaming firm, from using references to the Big
Board at the New York-themed hotel and casino, asserting they
tarnished its name and trademarks.</LD>
<LD>   The case, filed in 1997, was dismissed by a lower court judge in
1999. But an appeals court Monday reinstated it.</LD>
<TE>   The NYSE wants "to preserve a reputation for integrity and
transparency," the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. A jury
"might therefore find that the casino's humorous analogy to its
activities--deemed by many to involve odds stacked heavily in favor
of the house--would injure NYSE's reputation."</TE>
<TE>   New York-New York features replicas of the city's neighborhoods
and familiar images in its design, including a "Greenwich Village"
food court and a "Coney Island Emporium." The casino's version of the
NYSE is located in the "Financial District" where cashiers' cages sit
under a sign that reads "New York New York $lot Exchange."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court reinstated only some of the exchange's legal
claims. The three-judge panel said the NYSE could sue over the use of
a replica of its "distinctive" building facade in the casino's
financial district.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Mirage shares fell 73 cents to $35.50 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Prominent venture capital firm Accel Partners is proposing to cut its
$1.4-billion fund in half, providing yet another sign the industry
continues to cool from its record fund-raising and investing activity
over the last two years. Accel proposes to manage a $700-million fund
and hold off investing an additional $700 million until at least late
2003. If approved by its investors, Palo Alto-based Accel's cutback
would be the latest in a series of similar moves among venture firms.</LD>

<HD>Xerox Agrees to Record SEC Fine</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Copier giant will pay $10 million and restate
results in latest agency crackdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the latest salvo in the Securities and Exchange Commission's
campaign against misleading corporate accounting, Xerox Corp. said
Monday that it agreed to pay a record $10-million fine and to restate
five years of financial results.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement in principle, subject to final approval by SEC
commissioners, would settle an investigation launched in 2000 into
Xerox's alleged premature booking of more than $2 billion in revenue
from equipment leases from 1997 through 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, the Stamford, Conn.-based copier giant would
neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   But the fine would be the highest ever for a financial reporting
violation by a public company, eclipsing the $3.5-million penalty
levied against America Online Inc. in May 2000 for allegedly
improperly inflating earnings, said SEC spokesman John Nester.</TE>
<TE>   "It strikes me as a surprising amount, probably a function of the
post-Enron atmosphere," said Lorraine A. Horton, an accounting
professor at the University of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   She added, however, that the SEC's crackdown on accounting abuses
is "long overdue," and that a steady stream of fines and public
exposure "may make the industry pay more attention."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC has been focusing on corporate bookkeeping for several
years, but it has stepped up its activity since the collapse of Enron
last fall. By late February, the agency had launched 45
investigations of financial statement fraud this year, nearly triple
the number of cases in the same period in 2001, Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox said in January that the SEC was accusing the company of
abusing accounting rules to inflate its financial results.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox gets much of its copier revenue under leases in which
equipment, service, supplies and financing are bundled together in a
single monthly payment. The dispute with the SEC involves Xerox's
allegedly booking revenue upfront rather than over time, in violation
of accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   The company has since changed its accounting methods, it said.
Last year it restated results for the previous three years because of
accounting issues in its Mexican unit.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say many companies felt pressure in the late 1990s to
find ways to artificially drive up their results as Wall Street
focused intently on quarterly earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was trying to boost earnings to beat" analysts'
earnings estimates, said D. Larry Crumbley, accounting professor at
Louisiana State University. "If you missed by a penny, you got killed
in the stock market."</TE>
<TE>   Xerox shares soared from $20 in 1996 to more than $60 by 1999,
then collapsed as the company faced rising competition and surging
borrowing costs. The company has been struggling to get itself back
on track.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive Anne M. Mulcahy said in the
statement Monday that the company "is best served by putting these
issues with the SEC behind us and focusing on restoring the company
to good health, sustained profitability and future growth."</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which fell to less than $4 in 2000, rose 33 cents to
$11.08 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe [Monday's] agreement alleviates some of the overhang
on Xerox's share price," said analyst Shannon S. Cross of Merrill
Lynch, maintaining a "buy" rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox said it couldn't yet estimate how it would reapportion
revenue, but it said there would be "no impact on the cash that has
been received or is contractually due to be received" from its
leases.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said the restatement would involve adjustments
that could total more than $300 million "due to the establishment and
release of certain reserves prior to 2001" and other items.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it has asked for a 15-day extension on the
deadline for filing its 10K annual financial statement to the SEC in
order to complete the restatement of results. It also said it later
may request a 75-day extension.</TE>
<TE>   The Xerox case is another in a series of high-profile accounting
cases the SEC has brought in recent years. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * In February 2001, former Cendant Corp. Chairman Walter A. Forbes
and former Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton were indicted on charges of
inflating company earnings in what prosecutors called one of the
biggest securities frauds ever. The criminal and SEC civil charges
contend Forbes and Shelton contributed to a decade-long fraud scheme
mostly at CUC International Inc., a predecessor to Cendant.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant restated three years of results, saying former CUC
executives inflated earnings before charges by $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes and Shelton have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial
in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   * In May 2001, the SEC filed a suit in federal court in Miami
against Al Dunlap and other former Sunbeam Corp. executives, along
with accounting firm Andersen, accusing them of engaging in a massive
financial fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Sunbeam ultimately was forced to restate its financial results for
the six quarters before Dunlap was ousted as chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Dunlap has agreed to pay $15million to settle a shareholder
lawsuit that accused him and other former executives of mismanagement
and fraud at the small-appliance maker, which is reorganizing under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC charges against the executives still are pending.</TE>

<HD>Burly Bear Expands Its Territory</HD>
<DH>Television: The cable network, which caters to college
campuses, seeks a wider audience. TBS now features its programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>David Mandel and Steve Lookner are building an audience one college
dorm room at a time.</LD>
<LD>   They're co-hosts of "Dave and Steve's Video Game Explosion," the
most popular program on Burly Bear, a television network most people
over age 25 have never heard of.</LD>
<LD>   The two sit, Wayne and Garth-like, in front of a camera, and
expound upon the latest electronic toys. Instead of thumbs-up or
thumbs-down, their rating scale ranges from "buy it" to "turn off
your console, go outside and get some fresh air."</LD>
<TE>   Now Burly Bear has roamed off of college campuses. Its shows can
be seen twice a week on TBS: 11 p.m. on Wednesdays and various times
on Thursdays (though it is preempted from Thursdays through the month
of April).</TE>
<TE>   "We're distinguishing ourselves as producers of high-concept,
relatively low-cost programming with lots of fresh faces and energy
to burn," said Howard Handler, Burly Bear's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Burly Bear was started in 1995 by five friends from Connecticut.
While on a ski vacation, they saw a TV channel devoted strictly to
vacation resorts that was only available at those locations.</TE>
<TE>   Just out of college, they thought a similar network aimed at 18-
to 24-year-olds would work, believing that few existing networks
spoke that age group's language.</TE>
<TE>   Universities across the country had been wiring their dormitories
for cable TV. They had room on those systems for a handful of
channels specific to them, but few ideas about what to show. Burly
Bear stepped into the vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   The network is now available on 450 campuses and occasionally is
offered on cable systems that serve college towns.</TE>
<TE>   They get shows like "Half Baked," a rock 'n' roll cooking program;
"Impostor," a hidden-camera show that stages stunts like sending
preppy breakdancers to the sidewalks of Harlem; and "Celebrity
Highway," a cartoon that mocks celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   A cramped studio in midtown Manhattan is home to Burly Bear shows.
Technicians haul out different backdrops for the different hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Burly Bear gets a thumbs-up from Joe Capizzi, a senior at the
State University of New York at New Paltz. "I think it's really
funny," Capizzi said. "It kind of reminds me of MTV's 'Jackass,' in a
way."</TE>
<TE>   Burly Bear is carried on a cable system near SUNY New Paltz, in
New York's Catskill Mountains. Fortuitously, that's where Lorne
Michaels, executive producer of "Saturday Night Live," has a vacation
home. He happened upon Burly Bear one day while channel surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels' production company, Broadway Video, bought a majority
stake in Burly Bear in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the founders, James Mairs and Matt Fry, started an
independent production company to make "Half Baked." The show has
just ended its run at Burly Bear.</TE>
<TE>   The new management has stayed generally true to the original
mission, but "when you take on bigger entertainment partners they
bring a certain quality to it," Mairs said. "It loses its innocence a
little."</TE>
<TE>   Burly Bear has an advantage over its chief competitor, the College
Television Network, because its programming is available in dorm
rooms while CTN can only be seen in common areas.</TE>
<TE>   But Burly Bear may soon face a behemoth. Viacom is reportedly
considering launching an MTV spinoff, called MTVU, that would compete
directly on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   That's a compliment to the idea of Burly Bear, but it could be a
threat. "I don't know if that will mean the death of Burly Bear,"
Mairs said. "MTV is such a monster, and they are so effective at
delivering products that people that age really love."</TE>
<TE>   Burly Bear wants to expand slowly, perhaps adding more hours on
TBS. But the network plans to remain true to its college roots and
form of distribution, Handler said. It has tried different marketing
ideas, including a partnership with NBC to produce Winter Olympics
programming in the weeks leading to the Games.</TE>

<HD>Now Adjusting Rabbit Ears</HD>
<DH>Television: Eugene Levy plays an ex-hotshot producer on
'Greg the Bunny.' Meanwhile, he's preparing for another mock
documentary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eugene Levy was surprised when it seemed he had to audition for the
part of Gil Bender, the children's television show producer he plays
on the new Fox comedy "Greg the Bunny."</LD>
<LD>   On "SCTV," the legendary Canadian sketch comedy series that ran in
syndication and on NBC from 1977 to 1983, Levy had played characters
ranging from Bobby Bittman, the bombastic stand-up comic, to Earl
Camembert, the slightly befuddled local news anchor in the town of
Melonville. With writer-performer Christopher Guest, he had
collaborated on two quintessential mock documentaries, "Waiting for
Guffman" and "Best in Show."</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, well, listen, if I have to read for this, I may as
well pack it in," Levy said recently, over breakfast in Brentwood.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't help that he'd gone to the "Greg the Bunny" meeting in
pain, having just been released from the hospital for treatment of a
herniated disc. Levy ultimately didn't have to read for the part, but
he did improvise bits of Bender, whom he sees as a former big-shot
producer from the '70s, "when comedy was loud," now relegated to
working on a kids show.</TE>
<TE>   "The ideal thing would be to have the show hit reasonably well, so
that Fox kind of says they like the show, and everybody takes a deep
breath and relaxes, and allows the show to keep creeping into an area
that's more daring," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy's daring happens in fits and starts--movie and TV roles that
don't necessarily exploit his gifts, interspersed with the kind of
work the 55-year-old writer-performer was doing back in the Toronto
and Edmonton days on "SCTV."</TE>
<TE>   His family home is in Toronto, but Levy also has a place in L.A.,
where he is currently entrenched in guitar lessons--preparation for
his next movie project with Guest, called "A Mighty Wind."</TE>
<TE>   The film, which is scheduled to begin shooting in May, will root
around in the earnest subculture of aging folk musicians, in the same
way "Guffman" spoofed local theater and "Best in Show" lampooned the
Westminster Dog Show.</TE>
<TE>   In this one, a talent manager's death prompts his acts to hold a
reunion/tribute concert (the title is based on a folk anthem written
for the movie). Already, it is clear, Levy and Guest are having fun
coming up with their own kind of folk oral history.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the groups and you say, 'OK, now how did this group
form?'" Levy said of the back stories he and Guest are inventing.
"These guys played with this other group, they picked up these two
guys who used to be known as the Troubadours, and then they picked up
another guy out there--you know, Ramblin' Sandy Pitnick--and they
hooked up and formed this group, and then they joined this group, and
together they formed the Main Street Singers."</TE>
<TE>   The sincerity with which folk musicians approach their craft
became a memorable joke in the movie "Animal House," where John
Belushi happens upon a folk singer strumming a heartfelt tune on the
stairs of his frat house. Belushi listens for a few beats, then grabs
the guy's guitar and smashes it against the wall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Working on Third Film With Christopher Guest</TE>
<TE>   "What he hit on in 'Animal House' is kind of what we're trying to
tap into, which is there's kind of a pomposity and a little bit of an
arrogance about folk music and folk artists, some of them," Levy
said. "You find there's not a lot of people with a great sense of
humor about themselves and about their work. They're just too
intense, they're trying to get out the message."</TE>
<TE>   As with the two previous films, character-building is much more
essential to what the movie becomes than scripted dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the work that we do is put into character and character
backgrounds that usually don't end up in the final thing," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Though this is Levy's third film with Guest, the two have not been
working together all that long. According to Levy, Guest called him
in Toronto, out of the blue, in 1995, saying he wanted to collaborate
on a film idea--what was to become "Guffman." The two weren't
friends; in fact, Levy said, they'd only worked together previously
on a 1980s Billy Crystal special, "Don't Get Me Started."</TE>
<TE>   "He's not the easiest guy to get to know," Levy said of Guest.
"He's kind of standoffish, or he appeared to me to be a little
standoffish and not overly warm. When you come to know the man, you
know that nothing has changed--no, this is just his way. But he's a
very warm, funny person."</TE>
<TE>   What has changed, Levy said, is the eagerness with which Castle
Rock Entertainment, the studio behind their films, has approached
their work. For "Guffman"--released in 1996 and made on a budget of
$4 million--he and Guest had to pitch the idea first, write a
treatment, rewrite a treatment and then produce a script. The film
was a cult success and opened the market a bit for "Best in Show,"
which received a wider release.</TE>
<TE>   On their latest project, Levy said, producers didn't much
hesitate. "They heard the idea and said, 'When do you want to shoot
it?'"</TE>

<LD>Years ago, when film editor Robert Parrish wanted a tutorial in how
to direct movies, he paid a visit to the legendary John Ford on the
set of "The Grapes of Wrath." Parrish found Ford looking through a
hefty device called a finder, trying to decide where to set up the
camera for his next shot. Ford eventually waved Parrish over. It was
time for a lesson in the art of directorial command.</LD>
<LD>   To hear Ford tell it, if 9:30 a.m. arrived and you hadn't gotten
your first shot of the day, the studio would send out a producer-spy
to check up on things. "He won't come right up to you and tell you to
get off your [rear]," Ford explained. "He'll slink up to you like a
sidewinder and say, 'How's it going?' As soon as the son of a [gun]
speaks, and you're sure he's in the right spot, you swing the finder
around hard, like this."</LD>
<LD>   Without hesitation, the director swiveled and cracked Parrish on
the noggin with the finder. Blood flowed, but Ford offered no
apology. "After you've been at it a few years," he said without
looking up, "you'll discover that your aim will improve and you can
knock off two or three producers a week with your eyes closed."</LD>
<TE>   Many things about Hollywood have changed since Ford's heyday, but
this much remains the same: First-time directors are still learning
lessons you can't pick up in film school. Just ask John Lee Hancock,
who made his directorial debut over the weekend with "The Rookie," a
Disney film that stars Dennis Quaid as a Texas high school baseball
coach who gets a second chance at living out his dream of making it
to the major leagues. The film has won a raft of critical plaudits
for its lyricism and quiet authenticity, and it took in $16 million
at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   As the screenwriter of two films directed by Clint Eastwood, "A
Perfect World" and "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," Hancock
got to study at the feet of an old master too. A man of few words,
Eastwood didn't offer Hancock any long-winded lectures about
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "With Clint, you learn by watching," says Hancock, a native
Texan-turned-Angeleno who still drives a 1995 Ford pickup truck.
"John Cusack [who co-starred in "Good and Evil"] calls him the Zen
Daddy. He has this great calming influence on everybody, because he
knows what he wants. I sometimes wondered to myself why he would
shoot something one way and not another, but then you'd see the shot
in dailies and you'd go, 'Oh, I get it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Everybody, it seems, dreams of being a Hollywood director these
days. And the fantasy cuts both ways--studio executives are on the
prowl for the next Steven Soderbergh or Paul Thomas Anderson.
"There's no greater bond than being the first person to believe in
someone," says Disney production chief Nina Jacobson, who helped
Hancock get his directing job. "It's a relationship you hope will
last over an entire career."</TE>
<TE>   A lucky few phenoms make an instant impact. Actor Todd Field's
first directing effort, "In the Bedroom," earned a best picture Oscar
nomination this year. Music video director McG made a splashy debut
in 2000 with "Charlie's Angels," as did British theater director
Stephen Daldry, who earned raves for his first film, "Billy Elliot."
British theater director Sam Mendes ("American Beauty" [1999]) and
video director Spike Jonze ("Being John Malkovich" [1999]) landed
best director nominations for their rookie efforts, with Mendes
winning the Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Studios are tantalized for other reasons: First-timers work cheap,
can be put under "option" contracts for a second or third film and
are full of youthful energy. "They have a hunger that can make up for
a lack of experience," says DreamWorks production chief Michael De
Luca, who discovered such directors as Brett Ratner and the Hughes
brothers. "With established directors, you're always having to tell
them why they should do the movie. With first-timers, they're usually
saying, 'I'll die if you don't let me direct the movie.'"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, just as many rookies crash 'n' burn as go on to
stardom. The whole appeal of "Project Greenlight" was watching
first-time director Pete Jones being fed to the sharks. Tony Kaye was
a hot commercial director when De Luca hired him to make "American
History X." But Kaye ended up in a messy brawl with New Line Cinema
and disowned the movie after the studio allowed actor Edward Norton
to reedit the picture. Hollywood loves hiring flashy commercial
directors, but they are as likely to fail as a writer or actor making
the transition to directing features. Good movies rely on more than
just striking images. They require a director with storytelling
skill, rapport with actors and the ability to establish a consistent
tone.</TE>
<TE>   "In videos, you get accustomed to focusing all on style," says
Peter Care, a respected video and commercial director whose debut
film, "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys," is due out in June. "But
doing a movie, it's more about how do I get the feeling and emotion
right?"</TE>
<TE>   Coping with intense pressure is another challenge. Hancock tried
to relax by organizing lunchtime baseball games on the set. Care
began meditating and chanting before going to work. Actor Billy
Morrissette, who made his debut this year directing "Scotland PA.," a
comic version of "Macbeth" set in a 1970s burger joint, found himself
lying down on the set's restaurant counter between takes, trying to
collect himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like George W. Bush on his first day on the new job, with
everyone staring at me, saying, 'What's next, sir?'" he recalls. "I
was sweaty, I didn't sleep, my stomach was in knots. I even said,
'Action!' at the wrong time. It took about a week before I was
breathing normally."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock says his adjustment wasn't quite so difficult, but at 45,
he's had nearly 20 years of experience, having worked as a production
assistant, a script reader, TV producer and actor--he once did a
Kirin beer commercial with the unlikely duo of Gene Hackman and
Shannon Tweed. Hancock says his stint as a producer of two
short-lived CBS dramas, "L.A. Doctors" and "Falcone," proved
invaluable. "As a producer, I was in the editing room, trying to fix
any problems we had, so I really noticed who'd come in with a
well-conceived battle plan and avoided painting themselves in a
corner."</TE>
<TE>   "L.A Doctors" star Ken Olin, a veteran director himself, offered
especially useful advice. When writers create a scene, Olin told
Hancock, they often have a key image that resonates in their mind.
"You need to find that same image as a director, and even if you
can't explain to everybody why you need it, make sure you get it on
film, because that's the image that will always be in the final cut
of the movie."</TE>
<TE>   In "The Rookie," when Quaid begins his comeback attempt, we see
him on the mound, pitching to a catcher crouched behind home plate.
"I put the camera way back behind first base, so the pitcher's on one
side and the catcher's on the other, with this big puffy Texas sky
behind them," Hancock recalls. "That was my key image. When I
auditioned for the job, I told the Disney executives I wanted 'The
Rookie' to look like a baseball movie shot by John Ford. It wasn't
just a pretty shot. It was emblematic of this little man in a great
big world."</TE>
<TE>   Before filming began, Hancock screened Peter Bogdanovich's "The
Last Picture Show" so all of the non-Texans on his crew could see
what Texas really looked like.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first film I saw being made, and it's so great that I
wanted people to at least know that I was setting my sights high."</TE>
<TE>   Hancock wasn't nervous about pitching himself to Disney because
the film's producer, Mark Johnson, who'd worked with Hancock on many
previous projects, had told him the studio wanted a more experienced
director. "So I felt free to speak my mind," Hancock says. Driving
home from his meeting, he was surprised to get a call from Johnson,
who told him, "I hope you're serious about directing because you just
got the job." Hancock was elated.</TE>
<TE>   Then he remembered that he'd been so overwhelmed by the frantic
pace of events that he'd neglected to tell his wife, Holly, who'd
just given birth to twins, about the audition. "When I got home, I
said kind of sheepishly, 'I think I'm directing a movie.' And my wife
said, 'Really? How did that happen?'"</TE>

<HD>A Stage Seduction Their Own Way</HD>
<DH>Theater: 'Graduate' cast hopes a Broadway rendition stands
apart from the 1967 film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE GREEN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The clock's hands are making their straight-up, high-noon salute as
Kathleen Turner, every bit the sultry-voiced siren of legend,
saunters into the Cafe des Artistes, air-announcing, "I'm always on
time. The others are not."</LD>
<LD>   One of those others, Jason Biggs, dark-haired and still very much
the charming and slightly naive goof of his film image ("American
Pie") comes along shortly. His watch is losing time; he needs a
recommendation for a jeweler in the vicinity of the Upper West Side
sublet he's taken for the duration of "The Graduate" on Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   Turner--"an uptown girl," she calls herself--is full of advice.
And not the kind that her character, the older woman, Mrs. Robinson,
notoriously dispenses in the iconic tale of her seduction of a
younger man: Benjamin, played by Biggs.</LD>
<TE>   Alicia Silverstone, as daughter Elaine Robinson, destined to muck
up that relationship, is the final member of this trio of movie
stars-come-to-the-theater in yet another stage adaptation of a film.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Silverstone's reportedly stuck in traffic, but
eventually she appears, blond hair tousled, wondering if--perhaps a
throwback to "Clueless," her 1995 hit movie--"I should get an alarm
clock?" Turner has a thing she does with her eyebrows. Just saying
"arching" doesn't do it justice.</TE>
<TE>   Turner was up before dawn appearing on "Today" to promote the
play, which, after a three-city, out-of-town tryout and a couple of
weeks of previews here, opens Thursday at the Plymouth Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Ask her how much she identifies with Mrs. Robinson, and Turner
insists that, personally, younger men aren't that much of a turn-on.
"Unless you count my husband [real estate developer Jay Weiss], who's
a year younger than I am.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to love the bods, but no, there's not a lot of
conversation," she observes, a line that could be straight out of the
"Graduate" script--"Conversation? Why?" is Mrs. Robinson's bored
reply to Benjamin's attempts to chat.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the inspiration for banter between the two stars: Biggs,
who takes delight in pointing out Turner's archaic exclamations--"My
stars!," "Heavens to Betsy!"--immediately wants to know, "Are you
going to ask me about how I feel about older women? Well, among other
things, you've got to love their conversation!" Turner's response is
a head-back, toothy, mouth-wide howl of delight.</TE>
<TE>   As lunch progresses, Turner massages her arms beneath the blue
wool sweater that matches her eyes. "I work out a lot," she explains.
And of course she does, not just for her arthritic condition (which,
because of new medications she touts, is in remission) but because
there's that now-famous nude scene in the play's first act: In the
process of seducing Benjamin, Mrs. Robinson drops her towel and is
completely starkers. The audience always gasps.</TE>
<TE>   Turner admits it's a vanity thing keeping that discreetly lit,
fleeting image one that titillates, rather than causes pity. Turner
says she required convincing by director Terry Johnson that the
nudity "was right for the play and the character. I mean, who the
hell wants to do this? And it's a small theater."</TE>
<TE>   Turner and Biggs, who spends a lot of time on stage in his briefs,
say they pass each other en route to the gym. "I was about 20 pounds
heavier for 'American Pie,'" he says, "lost it, then put it back on
two years later for 'American Pie 2,' then decided I was going to get
in the best shape of my life."</TE>
<TE>   "Alicia," says Turner, "is the lazy one," and the younger actress
sheepishly nods her head as she says, "I just don't have any time. I
made out a list of priorities, and sleep is No. 1." Silverstone has
her own production company and last year began producing "Braceface,"
an animated series for cable television's ABC Family channel.</TE>
<TE>   As the only holdover from the original London cast, Turner is the
one who's been dealing longest with the inevitable comparisons to the
1967 movie of "The Graduate," a generational touchstone that starred
Anne Bancroft (who's on record as not being enthusiastic about this
venture), Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, sure, we benefit from the reputation of the film," she says.
"And there are similar moments. You can tell from the audience's
reaction that we've hit upon a memory," she continues--such as
knowing laughter at the one-word career advice--"plastics"--passed
along to the recent college grad Benjamin. "But I like to think
they're able to separate us and our interpretation from the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I want to do it my way. I haven't seen the film in 20
years, so there's nothing lingering, no place where I feel I'm
trespassing or borrowing from. Mine is the only Mrs. Robinson I
know."</TE>
<TE>   Re-creating Mrs. Robinson on this side of the Atlantic "did give
me pause," says Turner, a native of Missouri who grew up wherever on
the globe her diplomat father's career took him. "Been there, done
that kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   She did the show in London for just under six months, then began
touring in the States in the title role of "Tallulah," as in
Bankhead. But she hadn't been on Broadway since 1995's
"Indiscretions," and in her most recent film she played an
uncharacteristically dowdy character in "The Virgin Suicides" (2000).
She decided it would be nice to play her glamorous, vampish self as
well as be home with her family. (Fourteen-year-old daughter Rachel
"is very disapproving of the first two scenes" in "The Graduate."
"But she loves Jason.")</TE>
<TE>   Biggs and Silverstone weren't born when the movie of "The
Graduate" came out. Biggs, a New Jersey native who began working at
age 5 as a model, says he'd long been searching for another stage
vehicle (his previous stage turn was on Broadway in 1991's
"Conversations With My Father").</TE>
<TE>   When the project was announced, he pursued the part and was
excited at 23 "to step into a role [Hoffman] had made so famous. It's
an amazing character, certainly my biggest challenge." In adapting
the script for "The Graduate," Johnson went back to Charles Webb's
early-'60s novel and, among other changes, expanded the role of
Elaine. "She's fleshed out," says Turner. "I just remember Katharine
Ross as looking beautiful and walking around."</TE>
<TE>   Silverstone says she doesn't even remember the movie Elaine--"if I
ever even saw the movie"--and when she was first offered the role, in
the London production ("but after Kathleen had left"), turned it down
for that reason. "If I couldn't remember the image, why do it? But
when they came to me [for Broadway], I read it and realized that she
was really interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Also once a child model, Silverstone, who grew up in the San
Francisco Bay area, has spent her entire career in film. "This has
been a dream come true for me. I've always wanted to live in New York
and either do a play or study acting."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was not averse to having the 25-year-old help shape the
role: Outspoken on the subject of diet (her dogs are also vegans) and
animal rights, Silverstone, as Elaine, has a line denigrating the
hamburger Benjamin is devouring.</TE>
<TE>   It's not pure Silverstone, the actress quickly points out. "I
wanted to make it something that Elaine would be passionate about at
that time," she explains. "So I thought about starvation. My girl
goes to Berkeley, so I watched a really good movie, 'Berkeley in the
'60s,' which was very helpful."</TE>
<TE>   When "The Graduate" first appeared on the cusp of the sexual
revolution, its frankness in dealing with an unorthodox relationship
was one of the reasons for its enormous popularity. Now, 35 years
later, how does it hold up?</TE>
<TE>   "It does seem almost historical," says Turner of the '60s
mind-set. "All sexual relationships are more liberal now than they
were 30 years ago. We have to reteach them the old mores." But, she
admits, "I don't think it's a normal thing."</TE>
<TE>   Biggs, who says he's comfortable in the bedroom scenes with
Turner, says he finds Benjamin's situation "definitely not normal; at
least not where I come from."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's not so shocking for the audience now," Silverstone
says, "but from my point of view, I'm her daughter, he's my
boyfriend, I find it disgusting. Just plain weird."</TE>
<TE>   "I keep getting letters from women who write, 'Thank you for
keeping us as a serious threat,'" Turner says of her reception as
Mrs. Robinson. "In Toronto, someone sent me a book called 'The
Cougars'--that's what these women are called in Canada."</TE>
<TE>   Did she pick up any tips from the book? "Naw, Mrs. Robinson is way
ahead of them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<DH>Paul McCartney isn't calling it a farewell, but his tour
opens on a nostalgic note.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>By opening his first concert tour in nine years Monday with "Hello,
Goodbye," Paul McCartney touched on a key question: Is the former
Beatle just saying hello again in these shows, or is he saying
goodbye?</LD>
<LD>   McCartney wrote the lighthearted number about the uncertainty of
relationships in 1967, and he apparently views it as such a minor
part of his repertoire that he didn't include it in "Blackbird
Singing," his recent book of lyrics and poetry.</LD>
<LD>   But the upbeat song was the ideal opener for the concert at the
Arena in Oakland. After the deaths of prominent members of the
Beatles family raised questions about whether we are coming to the
end of this long and winding road in rock history, it offered
reassurance.</LD>
<TE>   I say high, you say low ... .</TE>
<TE>   You say stop, I say go, go, go ...</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why you say goodbye</TE>
<TE>   I say hello.</TE>
<TE>   There's no word in pop culture more transcendent than "Beatles," a
point that has been underscored each time the classic '60s rock
band's music is embraced by a new generation of fans.</TE>
<TE>   From the exhilaration of "I Saw Her Standing There" to the
comforting strains of "Let It Be" and "Hey Jude," the Beatles' music
has been remarkably immune for four decades to the shifts in style
and taste that render most pop acts quickly disposable.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that this could be the last time around for
McCartney, who turns 60 on June 18, no doubt contributed to the box
office heat of the seven-week tour, which includes stops May 4 at
Staples Center in Los Angeles and May 5 at the Arrowhead Pond in
Anaheim. During that time, he'll be seen by more than 400,000 people,
generating an estimated $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   In a pre-tour interview, McCartney downplayed the notion that this
is a farewell tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little cynical about ever saying something is a farewell
tour because so many people have said they were [bowing out] and they
came back," he said during a break from rehearsal last week on a
movie sound stage in Culver City. "Besides, I always thought I would
live until about 90 and the estimate is going up. I will probably be
wheeled up on stage, and sing [in a shaky voice] 'Yes-ter-daaaaay.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's also clear that McCartney isn't one of those musicians
who live for the road. He's only done four tours in the 32 years
since the breakup of the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   Even more to the point, McCartney and his fans have seen enough of
life's unexpected twists and turns to know that nothing is certain.
The tour comes in the still tender aftermath of the cancer-related
deaths of his wife, Linda, in 1998 and Beatles guitarist George
Harrison last year.</TE>
<TE>   In putting together this tour, McCartney understands that the
shows are about more than music. They're also about community and a
shared history. The emphasis was on intimacy and warmth Monday,
including a lengthy acoustic session in which he saluted the late
John Lennon and Harrison, dedicating a song to each.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for the arena doors to open Monday, numerous fans
expressed the belief that this could be their last chance to
celebrate the legacy of the Beatles. Drummer Ringo Starr is the other
surviving member, but McCartney, along with Lennon, wrote most of the
material, and is viewed as the more essential connection.</TE>
<TE>   "We drove 11 hours to see this," said Matt Jarvis, 47, who owns a
radio station in Waldpoint, Ore. He was standing with his girlfriend
and her 12-year-old daughter. "I've been a fan 40 years and never
seen the Beatles, and I figure this might be our last chance."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Coggin, 43, a roofer in the Bay Area, stood nearby with his
two sons, 12 and 11. "I've seen every one of Paul's tours, but this
one is special because [the boys] can see him too. It's a memory
we'll always share."</TE>
<TE>   It's been almost 40 years since the English quartet captured the
hearts of America in a single TV appearance on "The Ed Sullivan
Show," and the sense of connection remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   In the early minutes of Monday's concert, McCartney reached back
to some of the Beatles' first hits, including "All My Lovin'," one of
the songs performed on the group's historic 1964 Sullivan show
appearance. Of some three dozen songs on the set list, about half
were from his Beatles period. But he also found room to showcase his
later songs, including "Jet," "Live and Let Die" and "Let Me Roll
It."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney's post-Beatles work has been strikingly uneven, but he
chose the best of that material for the show. After a high-energy
first half-hour that included three of the most engaging songs from
his recent album, "Driving Rain," the bassist undertook the evening's
most dramatic move when he excused his band (Paul "Wix" Wickens on
keyboards, Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums, and Rusty Anderson and Brian
Ray on guitars) and performed 11 of his most endearing tunes in solo
format, playing mainly acoustic guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than just the hits, he sprinkled in some less obvious
Beatles numbers, including "Blackbird," his civil rights anthem from
1968 that features one of McCartney's loveliest melodies, and "Mother
Nature's Son," an expression of environmental awareness from the same
period.</TE>
<TE>   The most tender moment, however, came when he saluted his deceased
bandmates. He toasted Lennon, who was murdered in 1980, with "Here
Today," a 1982 song about their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "When people are around, it's not always easy to tell them what
you feel," McCartney told the 14,000 fans. "After my dear friend John
passed on, I wrote this song."</TE>
<TE>   The tune acknowledges the much-publicized tensions between the
pair over the Beatles' breakup in 1970, but concludes by saying, "But
as for me/I still remember how it was before/And I'm holding back the
tears no more/I love you."</TE>
<TE>   Then, accompanying himself on ukulele, McCartney sang Harrison's
most tender ballad, "Something."</TE>
<TE>   The audience applauded the "I love you" line in "Here Today" and
sang along on the more familiar "Something." (McCartney saved his
salute to Linda for later in the concert with "My Love," one of
several songs inspired by their relationship.)</TE>
<TE>   At the rehearsal in Los Angeles last week, McCartney said that he
put the show together by trying to look at it from the audience's
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were going to see Bob Dylan, for instance, I'd want to hear
'Mr. Tambourine Man.' So I just thought, 'What would someone want to
hear if they were coming to see me?'</TE>
<TE>   "Then I added a few of my own ideas, like the George thing with
the ukulele. I used to play 'Something' at home with the ukulele long
before [Harrison's illness]. George was a big ukulele fan. At the end
of George's evening, the ukulele always came out. It was like the
port."</TE>
<TE>   McCartney got the idea for the long acoustic segment while doing
poetry readings last year to promote his book.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed just being alone in front of an audience and thought it
would be a good idea to go one on one in the concert in some way," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a daring move because it's hard to hold an audience's
attention for a long time without a band in an arena setting.</TE>
<TE>   But in that remarkable segment, McCartney and his audience didn't
need any other musicians--they had 40 years of memories to accompany
them. It was a memorable moment that stepped beyond pop-rock
conventions to create an intimacy and warmth that lived up to the
most endearing and inspiring moments of the Beatles' legacy.</TE>

<HD>'Bull Durham': Once and Always Original</HD>
<DH>Movies: Ron Shelton lets his baseball flick stand as is for
its release on a special-edition DVD. Still, he has some stories to
tell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Writer-director Ron Shelton hasn't seen the new special-edition DVD
of his 1988 baseball comedy "Bull Durham" (MGM, $25), although he did
participate in the new documentary featured on the disc that arrives
in stores today. He's also featured on a commentary track--but that
was recorded four years ago for the movie's laserdisc release.</LD>
<LD>   "I just said what came into my mind," Shelton recalls. "I've never
even heard it. I get more letters about that commentary and I don't
even know what I said."</LD>
<LD>   It's not that Shelton has anything against the laser or digital
formats. He just doesn't have much use for all the frills. Unlike
most special-edition discs, there are no deleted or alternate scenes
included on the "Bull Durham" DVD.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have a different cut or edit from the original," Shelton
says. "I figure that's how I saw it at the time and that's how I'll
live or die with it. That is not to say you wouldn't re-cut the movie
differently any time in your life. It's just how I did it then and
that's how I'll let it stand. I like DVDs to watch the movies, but I
don't really want to know what someone is telling [on the commentary]
because their job is telling me in the story."</TE>
<TE>   Named by Sports Illustrated as the No. 1 sports movie of all time,
the racy, romantic and funny baseball tale stars Kevin Costner as an
aging minor league catcher, "Crash" Davis, who is transferred to the
Durham Bulls in North Carolina to train and discipline the Bulls'
cocky young pitcher, "Nuke" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins). Susan Sarandon
plays the sexy baseball groupie, Annie Savoy, who each season picks
one player to "train" and "nurture." And this year, she's decided
that both Nuke and Crash are her "draft picks."</TE>
<TE>   "Bull Durham," which was shot on location in Durham and several
other minor league cities in the Carolinas, offered Costner one of
his best roles and made Robbins a star. (The two actors are featured
on a separate commentary track on the DVD.) Sarandon and Robbins
became a couple during the production, and Shelton is godfather to
their first child, Jack Henry.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton, who made his directorial debut with the comedy, won the
Writers Guild of America Award for his script and received an Oscar
nomination for best original screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   The film's baseball scenes are some of the most authentic ever put
on screen--and for good reason: Shelton played minor league ball for
the Baltimore Orioles for six years. "I played A ball through Triple
A," he says. "I played mostly second base."</TE>
<TE>   Though minor leaguers get paid next to nothing and spend most of
their professional lives traveling from game to game on a bus,
Shelton says it was the best time of his life. "It is also a nervous
time," he adds. "You are terrified of being cut loose. Everybody is
getting the pink slip, and you have to perform every day or you are
going to be cut loose. Everything you do is being translated into
statistics for all time. Everything I ever did you can look up the
record on. It certainly prepares you for anything else in the world,
including making movies."</TE>
<TE>   Besides "Bull Durham," Shelton has looked at the world of
basketball in "White Men Can't Jump," golf in "Tin Cup" and boxing in
"Play It to the Bone." But he's never been fond of sports movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated 'The Pride of the Yankees,'" he says, referring to the
1942 classic about Yankee great Lou Gehrig, played by Gary Cooper.
"It was my mother's favorite movie, and I could never tell her how
awful it was. As an adult, it is even worse. I think most of the
sports movies are told from the fan's point of view. I try to tell
them from the player's point of view."</TE>
<TE>   When Shelton wrote the script of "Bull Durham," sports movies were
box-office poison. Though only budgeted at $7 million, everybody
turned it down, he says. "People liked the script but they were
afraid of me as a first-time director," Shelton says. "They were
certainly afraid of the subject of baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Shelton had 30 days to get the movie off the ground
with Costner. "Then he was going to have to commit to something
else," Shelton says.</TE>
<TE>   On the 29th day, the script was sent to Orion Pictures' East Coast
office. "Orion on the West Coast had already turned it down twice,"
Shelton says. But Orion executive Bill Bernstein read it that
Thursday night and by 3 the next afternoon--the 30th day--Shelton had
a deal. "Five weeks later we shot the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Because Shelton got the green light so late in the year, "Bull
Durham" was filmed in October and November. "It was freezing," says
the director. The grass was changing color, so the production staff
continually had to paint the baseball field green. Many of the
baseball scenes were shot at night to camouflage the fact that the
leaves were also turning brown.</TE>
<TE>   Making the movie was fun, but Shelton says he wasn't sure he'd
ever work again. "You never know if a movie is going to be
successful," he explains. "It didn't test particularly well. When it
opened and got all of those reviews and people were going crazy for
it, I was the most shocked guy in the world. I am delighted that the
movie seems to have found such a life of its own."</TE>

<LD>   Sills Sets Departure Date From Lincoln Center</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Sills, the former opera great who has led Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts for eight years, announced Monday that she is
resigning at the end of the month.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel privileged to have served this great performing arts
center, and very happy to have, hopefully, made a difference in the
city where I was born and love so much," Sills said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Sills, who turns 73 next month, has for some time expressed a
desire to retire from the volunteer post as chair of the world's
largest performing arts center. During her tenure, she helped nurture
a redevelopment project estimated to cost about $1 billion. The
project has been a source of some turmoil for Lincoln Center, with
competing arts groups arguing over its size and scope.</TE>
<TE>   Sills had indicated that she would leave after the board found a
successor to Gordon Davis, who abruptly resigned as Lincoln Center's
president last fall after less than a year in office. Last month, the
board of directors approved his successor, Reynold Levy, a senior
lecturer at Harvard Business School who has led several high-profile
nonprofit organizations.</TE>

<TE>   'Nightline' Again Delays Its Series on Gay Life</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Nightline" had hoped to air next week its once-postponed
weeklong series on gay life in America, but breaking news has again
gotten in the way.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall the series was postponed for coverage of the aftermath
of the terrorist attacks; next week, producers are worried that the
unstable situation in the Middle East will make it impossible to air
all five installments. The network said it will try to find another
air date as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, ABC has scheduled a news special, anchored by Peter
Jennings, on the growing sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church,
for Wednesday at 10 p.m.</TE>

<TE>   CBS Military Series Struggles in Ratings</TE>
<TE>   CBS' "AFP: American Fighter Pilot," the first of several series
profiling real members of the armed services, got off to a poor start
in its premiere Friday. The program averaged less than 5 million
viewers, based on Nielsen Media Research estimates, finishing last
among the four major broadcast networks in its time period.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ten Commandments," meanwhile, demonstrated its durability, as
ABC's four-hour-plus Easter Sunday telecast of the 1956 film easily
won the night, averaging 12.5 million viewers.</TE>

<TE>   Hitmaker for Boy Bands Cleared of Labor Charge</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pearlman, the hitmaker behind the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync,
has been cleared of allegations that he broke child labor laws.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Department of Labor said there was no evidence that
Pearlman and his Orlando-based company, Trans Continental
Entertainment, violated such rules as making minors work past 11:30
p.m., as alleged by the mother of two of his former entertainers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to say that we are vindicated, as expected, from all
allegations," Pearlman said.</TE>

<TE>   James Taylor to Receive Songwriting Award</TE>
<TE>   James Taylor was named Monday to receive the Founders Award from
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The award
is "given to pioneering songwriters who have made exceptional
contributions to music," the organization said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor will receive the award May 20 at ASCAP's 19th annual pop
music awards ceremony at the Beverly Hilton. ASCAP President Marilyn
Bergman praised him as "a truly defining American musical voice."</TE>
<TE>   Previous recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award include Joni
Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, Stephen Sondheim, Billy Joel, Jerry Leiber
and Mike Stoller, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Andre Previn, Steely
Dan and Tom Waits.</TE>

Exposition Park plan a renovation of up to $300 million.</DH>

<LD>The board of trustees of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County has selected five candidates to design a $200-million to
$300-million renovation of the museum's Exposition Park complex.</LD>
<LD>   The firms are David Chipperfield Architects, and Foster and
Partners, both of London; the Swiss-based Herzog &amp; de Meuron; New
York's Steven Holl Architects; and Boston's Machada and Silvetti
Associates.</LD>
<LD>   Jane Pisano, president and director of the Natural History Museum,
told The Times that museum officials will meet with the architects in
May, with a final selection due this summer. A capital campaign to
pay for the renovation will begin in June 2003, and construction is
scheduled for 2006.</LD>
<TE>   The 89-year-old museum, devoted to cultural and natural history,
had been considering relocating from its 14-acre site overlooking the
Rose Garden in Exposition Park, one of the oldest civic centers in
the city. Instead, the trustees decided in 2001 to remain in the park
and to preserve the museum's original 1913 structure, as well as a
neoclassical foyer, dating from the 1920s, with flanking diorama
halls.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the 410,000-square-foot complex will be demolished or
significantly redesigned, including the 1960 Delacour Auditorium; a
three-story, 46,000-square-foot addition built in the 1970s; and the
entire south facade, which was part of a 1924-1930 addition that was
never completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a more iconic architecture--something that will be a
magnet to the Exposition Park area," Pisano said. "All of these
architects are capable of that. The existing additions weren't done
in a way that was sensitive to the original structure, and we have an
opportunity to have an architecture that relates better to its
context, to make a more inside-outside experience with the parks."</TE>
<TE>   Another part of the redesign's aim, Pisano said, will be to open
up more of the museum's curatorial and research functions to public
view. It will also allow for updating of exhibitions and the creation
of an on-site storage area for the museum's collection.</TE>
<TE>   The museum project is part of a broader redevelopment effort in
Exposition Park, which is located just south of downtown in a mostly
low-income neighborhood adjacent to USC. Across the Rose Garden,
plans are underway to transform the 1926 Armory Building into a
Science Education Resources Center with an adjoining elementary
school designed by the Santa Monica-based architectural firm
Morphosis.</TE>
<TE>   The California Science Center, designed by Zimmer Gunsel Frasca,
opened in 1998; Frank Gehry's 1984 aerospace museum, which has just
undergone an extensive renovation, reopened last month. And the
California African American Museum is scheduled to reopen this fall
after a $3-million refurbishing.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last year, museum officials considered a move to a
county-owned site on Grand Avenue opposite the Walt Disney Concert
Hall, now under construction. But the museum decided not to abandon
its historic roots, said Pisano. "Exposition Park is common ground,"
she said. "We felt strongly that the institution has an important
role to play in bridging economic and cultural divides in the city. "</TE>
<TE>   The architects now under consideration were selected from a field
of 70. Each has an international reputation and has played a role in
the boom in museum design in recent years. Steven Holl was one of
five architects who participated in last year's competition to
redesign the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He is the architect of
the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in Helsinki,
Finland, in 1999. Herzog &amp; de Meuron's Tate Modern in London opened
in 2000. Norman Foster, the lead architect of Foster and Partners,
renovated the British Museum's Great Court, which also opened in
2000. He is designing a major addition for Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts. David Chipperfield is working on the design for the renovation
of Berlin's Neues Museum and an arts center in Verona, Italy. Machado
and Silvetti's design for the renovation and expansion of the Getty
Villa in Malibu was completed in 1998, although its construction has
been stalled by lawsuits brought by the surrounding community.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the final selection process for the Natural History
Museum, the architects will present relevant past projects and
discuss general strategies for a redesign. They are not being asked
to present specific designs for the project, as they would in an
architectural competition. Nor do museum officials have plans to
visit any of the architects' existing buildings--such tours have also
become a common feature of the selection process at major cultural
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to pick an architect, someone who'll be our partner,"
Pisano said of the interview process. "Not a design."</TE>

<LD>If you had a family album stretching back to the dawn of animal life
on Earth, you'd find the first picture to be of a sponge. Not the
square sponge carcass found in bathrooms, but something more like the
sponges living in today's oceans. At least, that is what the
evolution of evolutionary theory has determined.</LD>
<LD>   A new PBS series, "The Shape of Life," presents this finding and
other revelations about evolution in an intelligent and highly
watchable format. Though the science itself is remarkable on its own,
the documentary keeps the action focused through spectacular
underwater photography, nicely used computer animation and a
generally tight script.</LD>
<LD>   In the first of the two hourlong installments being shown tonight,
"The Shape of Life" begins with a longish introduction full of a lot
of unanswered questions; don't let that turn you off. Soon enough,
the scene shifts to Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, where UC Santa Cruz
biologist Christina Diaz is researching the surprisingly complex
structure of sponges.</LD>
<TE>   "I think they are beautiful, they are original, they are
mysterious," Diaz says. "They have lots of secrets that we have to
unveil."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, it was the sponge's apparent physical simplicity
that initially led scientists to suspect it to be the first animal.
But it wasn't until recent advances in the reading of genetic
blueprints that Mitch Sogin, director of the program in molecular
evolution at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in
Massachusetts, found the most definitive evidence yet of the sponge
as the foundation of the animal kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shape of Life" continues tonight with Part 2, which examines
how animals began to move. Later episodes center on, among other
things, the first hunters, the emergence of life on land and how
these weird and fantastic creatures we've seen relate to human
development.</TE>
<TE>   Though creationists may have a difficult time with this series, it
is well worth seeing, no matter what one's beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Shape of Life" premieres tonight at 9 on KCET, followed by
Part 2 at 10 p.m. Subsequent episodes will air April 9 and 16, and
May 19 and 26.</TE>

<LD>Golf is a sport that, once played, can be dangerously addictive. "The
Sweet Spot" is a show that, once viewed, holds no such peril.</LD>
<LD>   The series, premiering tonight at 10 on Comedy Central, follows
Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray and John Murray as they
address the game of golf through skits, parodies and brotherly
banter. The problem is that too many jokes are seriously shanked.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's show, the first of five half-hour installments, opens
practically like an infomercial for a Florida course. It's a sly
commentary on pro golf's fawning broadcasters, if you give the
Murrays the benefit of the doubt. If you don't, it comes across as a
shameless plug. Either way, the announcer tells us that the men will
compete for a sad-sack trophy called the Braggart's Cup.</LD>
<TE>   The next scene takes place in the clubhouse, where the brothers
are staring one another down so intensely that they get stuck in the
doorway trying to exit simultaneously. They emerge not at the first
tee, but onstage, dancing around like 'N Sync. (Think of them as the
Backswing Boys.)</TE>
<TE>   After this sort-of transition, the game kind of begins. Despite
their various talents, the Murrays don't have anything more
interesting to say on the course than your typical Saturday foursome
does.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why they've punched it up with a wide range of
parodies of everything from ESPN to the MasterCard "priceless"
commercials to Tim Conway's "Dorf on Golf." Those are among the
show's funniest bits, whereas a subplot about Ponce de Leon and the
Fountain of Youth quickly gets old.</TE>
<TE>   The Murrays clearly know a lot about the game and can write a lot
of jokes, good or bad, about it. Although they pretty much succeeded
in "Caddy- shack," a film co-written by Brian and co-starring Bill,
they could use a mulligan for "The Sweet Spot."</TE>

<LD>Some people will tell you that the first Monday in April is as good
as it gets for sports fans: opening day in baseball stadiums across
the country, followed by the championship game of the NCAA men's
basketball tournament that night.</LD>
<LD>   I'd call it third, at best.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with baseball's opening day is that it inspires too
much gooey commentary. Announcers gush over the sight of kids eating
hot dogs. I read a story Monday that focused on the beauty of
bunting--not the red, white and blue drapery around the ballparks but
squaring the bat and lightly hitting the ball.</LD>
<TE>   And when you get down to it, does any single game have less to do
with the outcome of the season than the first of baseball's 162?
Remember the Dodger opener last year, when Gary Sheffield hit a home
run and the Dodgers shut out the Milwaukee Brewers? That turned out
to be an omen of ... nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the only thing wrong with the NCAA championship is that it's
just a game. Not multiple games. We get so spoiled by all of the
hoops throughout March that having only one game on the docket feels
like a letdown. That's why the first day of the tournament, with its
wall-to-wall ball, is actually more fun.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback to the first Monday in April: The NBA--perhaps as
a way to keep Billy Packer from harping on the evils of the pro game
for maybe three whole seconds--shuts down the shop and lets the
college kids have the stage to themselves. It's hard for me to show
too much love for any day without the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   With far less hype, the Sunday a week before is the best sports
day of the year: two NCAA regional finals, the last round of the
Players Championship--golf's "fifth major"--a national NBA game or
two. Plus, the Oscars (if you can get into a pool for it, it counts
as a sport).</TE>
<TE>   Last year's edition, March 25, 2001, might have been the greatest
couch potato day of all time. Illinois vs. Arizona and Temple vs.
Michigan State in the NCAA tournament. The Lakers vs. the Sacramento
Kings. Tiger Woods winning the TPC. "Gladiator" taking home best
picture at the Oscars. And a new episode of "The Sopranos." My one
and only plant moved more than I did that day.</TE>
<TE>   (Speaking of inactivity, was there ever a better way to waste a
summer morning than watching the game show, "Press Your Luck?" I
mention this because they're bringing a new version of the show back
to TV. I know that because there was a promotion during Sunday's
Laker game that included the jarring sights of a life-sized Whammy
handing Easter candy to Magic Johnson, and Bill Walton waving his
hand over a buzzer and uttering the classic "Press Your Luck" mantra:
"Big Bucks, no Whammies ... STOP!")</TE>
<TE>   Well, there's a whole month to exercise and do other productive
things before another mandatory sit-down day: the first Saturday in
May. That weekend has NBA and NHL playoff games and, of course, the
Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you've never been to a racetrack, or think "exacta" is a
slogan from a Hertz commercial, you watch the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The Derby has it all. The pageantry of the "My Old Kentucky Home"
serenade. The anticipation as the horses enter the gate. The drama of
the finish. Come to think of it, the Derby has all of the best
elements of baseball, without the lengthy waits for pitching changes.
And the horses tend to drool and spit less than baseball players.</TE>
<TE>   What other sports celebrations can compete?</TE>
<TE>   Super Bowl Sunday has to count for something. It is the
most-watched annual event on television. But the endless pregame
yakking wears you down. And the other networks meekly bow down to the
Super Bowl. They'll offer up a basketball game as a snack and then
clear the table. Come on, we can handle more. We have
picture-in-picture.</TE>
<TE>   One day that isn't what it used to be is Jan. 1. By spreading its
top bowl games around, the bowl championship series is slowly
draining New Year's Day of its juice. You can't just finish up your
college football with one marathon session. You have to pace
yourself, leave a little something in the tank. And you can't even
count on the darkness enshrouding the Rose Bowl at the end of the day
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's opening day is losing tradition too. Why can't they
just start in Cincinnati on Monday all the time? This baseball season
began in Anaheim on Sunday night with a game televised on ESPN2.
Look, Cincinnati doesn't have much of a national profile. When I
think of Cincy, I think of chili and opening day. Let them have their
tradition back.</TE>
<TE>   Because without tradition, opening day is more and more like
another day. There's no "renewal" or "fresh start." The sport is
still miles away from labor peace, and the Yankees are still the team
to go through in October.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing that's still guaranteed to provide chills
on the first Monday in April: the "One Shining Moment" montage of
NCAA tournament highlights after the championship game.</TE>

<LD>The Seattle Mariners will not go wire-to-wire in the American League
West this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners, who led the entire way en route to a major league
record-tying 116 victories last season, fell short in their opener
Monday at Seattle when Mike Cameron flied out with the bases loaded
to end a 6-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a long season and we still have to find out some things
about our team," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "But we battled
back, which is good to see."</LD>
<TE>   Seattle rallied for four runs in the eighth to make it 6-5, then
threatened in the ninth against Keith Foulke.</TE>
<TE>   Mark McLemore and Ichiro Suzuki led off with singles and moved up
on Jeff Cirillo's sacrifice. But Bret Boone grounded back to Foulke
and, after Edgar Martinez was intentionally walked, Cameron hit a
routine fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   Foulke, third in the American League with 42 saves last season,
never felt like the game was slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   "I really never think like that," he said. "The end result was
there. We got the victory. But how we got there is definitely
something we have to work on. It made for an exciting opening day."</TE>
<TE>   Cameron was frustrated by the ending.</TE>
<TE>   "We let it slip away," Cameron said. "I let it slip away. I got a
fastball. I just missed the pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Piniella was encouraged by the way his team came back.</TE>
<TE>   "We had opportunities to win the game late, but they just wiggled
out of it," he said. "Give them credit."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Buehrle, who pitched six innings for the victory, gave up two
hits, including a home run by Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   Buehrle, a 16-game winner in his first full season in the majors
in 2001, struck out five and walked two. He retired 13 in a row
before he walked Cirillo with one out in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much had everything working for me," Buehrle said. "The
only thing that wasn't working for me was my fastball. There for a
couple of innings, I had problems locating my fastball."</TE>
<TE>   Freddy Garcia, who won 18 games last season and led the league
with a 3.05 earned-run average, was touched for three runs on eight
hits and two walks in 61/3 innings. He didn't have a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia was lifted after throwing 115 pitches, 11 more than
Buehrle.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw a lot of pitches and we didn't want any of our starters
going over 115 pitches," Piniella said. "So we got him out of there.
[Ryan] Franklin came in and they hit him pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Texas 3--Mark Mulder worked into the ninth inning and
struck out eight and the Athletics defeated former Dodger Chan Ho
Park and the Rangers at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder, who won 21 games last year with a 3.45 ERA, did not walk a
batter in his first opening-day start--facing a lineup that included
Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Rafael Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder entered the ninth with a four-hitter, but gave up a leadoff
double to Frank Catalanotto and a home run to Carl Everett before
being replaced by Chad Bradford.</TE>
<TE>   Park gave up six runs and nine hits over five innings in his first
outing with the Rangers after signing as a free agent. He struck out
five.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Kansas City 6--Jacque Jones homered on the second
pitch of the game, then hit a go-ahead three-run shot in the seventh
inning and the Twins hit five home runs in a victory at Kansas City,
Mo.</TE>
<TE>   David Ortiz, Brian Buchanan and Torii Hunter also homered for the
Twins, who survived Major League Baseball's attempt to eliminate them
when a Minnesota judge issued an injunction that forced the team to
honor its lease at the Metrodome.</TE>

<HD>Pitchers Could Be Trade Bait</HD>

<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years of replenishing and developing the Angels' stock of
young pitchers, General Manager Bill Stoneman might soon have to
drain that pool. Top pitching prospects are the most prized commodity
in baseball, and Stoneman might well have to trade several of his for
the Angels to win this season.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have long believed that Scott Spiezio would be most
effective off the bench, playing a variety of positions. With Shawn
Wooten expected to be sidelined two to four months after thumb
surgery, Spiezio is expected to get most of the playing time at first
base, weakening a bench otherwise lacking in power. The projected
triple-A lineup is short on power too, with only two players who hit
more than 11 home runs at any level last season.</LD>
<LD>   If Spiezio plays well, and Wooten returns relatively soon, the
Angels might do nothing. But Baseball America ranks the Angels'
first-base personnel as the worst in the league, and the Angels now
have the young pitching to trade for the proven first baseman that
could make the difference in a pennant race.</LD>
<TE>   "The more depth you have with power arms and high-ceiling
pitchers, the more you raise the interest of other scouts and other
organizations," Angel Scouting Director Donny Rowland said. "Once you
have that depth, you're a club people come to.</TE>
<TE>   "We have plenty of arms to offer if we need a position player."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels believe left-hander Joe Torres and right-handers Chris
Bootcheck, Bobby Jenks, John Lackey, Francisco Rodriguez, Johan
Santana and Matt Wise all could develop into legitimate major league
starters. They also consider right-handers Brendan Donnelly, Bart
Miadich and Scot Shields as qualified for major league relief roles.</TE>
<TE>   Two or three of those pitchers could net the Angels a proven first
baseman for years to come; one or two could bring a veteran hitter
eligible for free agency at the end of the season. Stoneman declined
to discuss the chances of his making such a trade to boost the
Angels' offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll judge that in May and June and July," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Spiezio suspended for the first five games of the season for
his aggression during spring training brawls with the San Diego
Padres, Benji Gil started Sunday's season opener at first base.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with Spiezio when he is allowed to participate,"
Stoneman said. "I'm not happy when he's not allowed to participate.
But we're still a pretty strong club."</TE>
<TE>   Does Stoneman consider first base a weak spot on an otherwise
strong club?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't judge it that way," he said. "Nobody questions the way
Spiezio plays defensively. He's a better hitter left-handed than
right-handed, but he's all right. He fits this club fine."</TE>

<HD>Sheffield a Success in His Brave Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>This is pretty much what the Braves had in the mind when they signed
Gary Sheffield and Vinny Castilla.</LD>
<LD>   The new Atlanta sluggers made quite an impact on opening day.
Sheffield and Castilla homered and had three runs batted in each on
Monday, leading the Braves to a 7-2 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies.</LD>
<LD>   "You couldn't ask for anything better," Tom Glavine said. "We're
excited about what they bring to this club, and they showed it
today."</LD>
<TE>   Glavine, starting in place of the injured Greg Maddux, pitched six
scoreless innings before tiring in the seventh. But pitching
excellence is old news in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The focus has shifted to offense after the Braves finished 13th in
the National League in runs a year ago, even while winning their 10th
consecutive division title. They have only one World Series
championship to show for that streak.</TE>
<TE>   Castilla hit a three-run homer in the third and Sheffield had a
two-run shot in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield, one of the game's most feared cleanup hitters, was
acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Dodgers. Jones was moved to
left field so the Braves could sign Castilla to play third base.
Sheffield drove in the Braves' first run with a groundout in the
opening inning. In the fifth, he came up with two out after Jones
walked for the third consecutive time. Philadelphia starter Robert
Person hung a breaking pitch and Sheffield knocked it over the
left-field wall for his first Atlanta homer. Sheffield trotted slowly
around the bases, pointed skyward as he touched home and was
serenaded with chants of "Gary! Gary!" As he took his position in
right field to start the sixth, the fans gave him another standing
ovation, many of them bowing.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans were great," Sheffield said of the 51,638 in the
stadium. "This is the most people I've ever seen in this stadium. It
got me going."</TE>

<LD>When Indiana surprised most media pundits by advancing to Monday
night's NCAA title game, some sportswriters, including Jay Mariotti
of the Chicago Sun-Times, praised Coach Mike Davis while taking shots
at Bob Knight, the Hoosiers' longtime coach before Davis replaced him
last season.</LD>
<LD>   "It is Davis, the outsider who has been harassed mercilessly by
Knight loyalists, who ends up fitting the state's values far better
than the legendary ogre he replaced," Mariotti wrote.</LD>
<LD>   The dictionary definition of an ogre: "A hideous giant of fairy
tales and folklore that feeds on human beings."</LD>
<TE>   Aw, come on, Jay, Knight isn't that bad.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What was the result of the Dodgers' first league game
played in Los Angeles in 1958?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Augusta bargains: GolfWorld magazine reporting on the Masters,
which will be played next week: "The slumbering economy and
aftereffects of Sept. 11 have combined to make this one of the
quietest springs for corporate hospitality in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Houses are renting for as much as 50% less than last year, say
local travel brokers; the cost of a black-market weekly badge is
between $2,500 and $2,800, down from $4,200 last year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, no! Reader Bob Barrows to the San Francisco Chronicle: "When I
umpired a girls' fast-pitch softball game the other day, the home
coach gave me a lineup card without listing either his catcher or
pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him why and he explained, 'Batteries not included.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Precautions: Comedy writer Earl Hochman: "Even though Ruben Rivera
signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers and will start
the season at Tulsa, Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriquez, taking no
chances, already has installed a dozen new fool-proof locks on his
equipment locker."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slim chances: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry, but I don't see the Diamondbacks repeating this year.
After [Randy] Johnson and Curt Schilling, their pitching is thinner
than Gwyneth Paltrow's Oscars dress."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amen: The late Bill Veeck once said, "Baseball is almost the only
orderly thing in a very un-orderly world. If you get three strikes,
even the best lawyer in the world can't get you off."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember Nat? Dave Lewandowski in the Indianapolis Star:</TE>
<TE>   "Now that John Stockton has turned 40, he's one of 10 men to play
in the NBA after that milestone birthday. The oldest was Nat Hickey,
who played one game at age 46 for Providence in 1947-48."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Dodgers beat the San Francisco Giants, 6-5, at
the Coliseum before a crowd of 78,762.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Cook of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, commenting
on the Pirates' prospects: "The Pirates were 69-93 in the 2000 season
for the second time in three years. It was their eighth consecutive
losing season....</TE>
<TE>   "'It can't possibly get worse,' you said at this time last year.
But it got a lot worse. The Pirates were 62-100 last season in
beautiful new PNC Park and were one of the big jokes in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't make the same mistake. This season could be uglier."</TE>

<LD>The Clippers' playoff chances have dwindled to next to nothing, but
they have other goals to reach before they put 2001-02 to rest.</LD>
<LD>   A winning record, the first in a decade is still possible. They
are 37-37 with eight games to play.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, it hasn't happened a lot," Coach Alvin Gentry said.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers were 41-41 in 1992-93, technically not a winning
mark, but close enough. They also were 45-37 in 1991-92.</TE>
<TE>   And that's it for .500 records since the franchise relocated to
Los Angeles from San Diego before the 1984-85 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also can become the first team since the Houston
Rockets to go from 15 victories to 40 or more in two seasons,
according to Gentry.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Rockets won 14 games in 1982-83, improved to 29-53
the next season and to 48-34 during the first season Hakeem Olajuwon
and Ralph Sampson were teamed together.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers won 15 games in 1999-2000, then 31 in Gentry's first
season as coach--the league's best improvement in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got a lot of positive things we can accomplish,"
Gentry said. "We're still going to play as if we're in the playoff
chase because we are. We're going to approach every game as if it
were the seventh game of the playoffs. Let's not kid ourselves, we're
an absolute longshot to make the playoffs now."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry indicated he would not alter his rotation in the final
eight games, except perhaps to give Corey Maggette minutes.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Tremaine Fowlkes will continue to start at small forward,
with Maggette coming into the game as a reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette was sidelined more than a month because of two dislocated
bones in his right hand, suffered when he punched the scorer's table
in anger during a Feb. 21 loss against the Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   He also underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during his
layoff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserves Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson have no plans to rest
nagging injuries down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Miles continues to be troubled by a sore left knee and did not
practice Monday.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to play Wednesday against the Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson has tendinitis in his left foot. He practiced Monday
and will play Wednesday.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Somewhere in the desert, Randy Johnson must have discovered the
Fountain of Youth.</LD>
<LD>   The Big Unit, winner of three Cy Young Awards in three seasons
with Arizona, threw a six-hitter as the Diamondbacks opened defense
of their World Series championship by defeating the San Diego Padres,
2-0, on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   With a fastball that topped out at 100 mph, the 38-year-old
left-hander struck out eight and walked one to defeat San Diego's
Kevin Jarvis.</LD>
<TE>   "You saw his velocity up on the board," San Diego's Phil Nevin
said. "Obviously, he hasn't lost anything. He's not old. He's getting
better with age."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grace homered and made several tough plays at first, and
Danny Bautista doubled in a run.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I feel extremely good about the way I pitched," Johnson
said, "and the way everybody played."</TE>
<TE>   When Johnson last left the mound at Bank One Ballpark on Nov. 4,
he had come out of the bullpen to get the last four outs in Game 7 of
the World Series against the New York Yankees. Then he watched from
the dugout as Arizona rallied with two runs in the ninth to win, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   In a 30-minute pregame ceremony in front of a sellout crowd of
47,025, the World Series championship banner was unveiled high above
the swimming pool in right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson earned his 31st career shutout and 80th complete game.
Johnson, 5-0 in 10 opening-day starts, got his first shutout in an
opener, throwing 127 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a freak of nature," Grace said. "It's a tribute to the shape
he's in and the drive he has. He may be another Nolan Ryan and pitch
until he's 45 because he's better now than he ever has been."</TE>

<LD>MVP Juan Dixon, Maryland, Gurard</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   FIRST ROUND vs. SIENA</LD>
<TE>   A determined Dixon made 10 of 17 shots and scored 29 points in an
85-70 victory. "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive. This is
my last time going through this and I want to tell myself that I went
out being aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND ROUND vs. WISCONSIN</TE>
<TE>   Dixon again scored 29 points and passed Len Bias as Maryland's
all-time leading career scorer in an 87-57 victory. Not bad for a kid
who needed a redshirt season just to put on enough weight to survive
in the Atlantic Coast Conference. "It's a great accomplishment,
especially in my situation,'' said Dixon, who raised his point total
to 2,172. "Coming into Maryland, a lot of people knocked [Coach] Gary
Williams for recruiting me. I just wanted to go out there and prove
those critics wrong."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REGIONAL SEMIFINALS vs. KENTUCKY</TE>
<TE>   Dixon's point production slipped to 19 but his teammates picked up
the slack in a 78-68 victory. "Today I didn't have to score 29, I
only needed to score 19 and make some defensive plays."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   REGIONAL FINAL vs. CONNECTICUT</TE>
<TE>   Dixon and fellow senior Lonny Baxter combined for 56 of the
Terrapins' points in a 90-82 victory. Dixon made 10 of 18 shots and
scored 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NATIONAL SEMIFINAL vs. KANSAS</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins nearly blew a 20-point lead in the 97-88 victory,
bringing back memories of the previous last year's Final Four game
when they lost a 22-point lead to Duke. After Kansas closed within
five points at 89-84 with 1:14 left, Dixon made a baseline jumper and
two throws on consecutive possessions to give Maryland some breathing
room. "I've been saying the whole week that if we ever got in that
position again--when we were up 22 points [and lose the lead]--we
were going to find a way to pull the game out," said Dixon, who
finished with 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NATIONAL FINAL vs. INDIANA</TE>
<TE>   Dixon attempted only nine shots and didn't score for nearly 20
minutes en route to his lowest tournament point total (18). But he
made a three-point shot seconds after the Hoosiers had overcome a
12-point deficit and taken their first lead of the game at 44-42 with
9:42 left. Dixon then came back with a fadeaway jumper over Indiana's
designated stopper Dane Fife and Maryland slowly pulled away to a
64-52 victory and its first national championship. "It's not the size
of the body," said Steve Blake of his 6-foot-2, 165-pound teammate.
"It's the will to want to get open, to want to score. He has that."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Can Gagne Pay Closing Cost?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manager Jim Tracy insists the Dodgers will attempt to fill their
closer role by committee, but converted starter Eric Gagne is
expected to pitch in closing situations to start the season, and the
club, which opens against San Francisco today at home, is hoping the
right-hander steps up and makes the job his own.</LD>
<LD>   "Could he eventually become our closer? I'm not ruling that out,"
Tracy said. "I'm very hopeful that's what happens, but for the time
being, we'll take it slowly."</LD>
<LD>   Gagne, who pitched a scoreless inning at Seattle Sunday, gave up
one earned run and eight hits in 19 innings over nine spring-training
appearances.</LD>
<TE>   Last Thursday night, Gagne entered an exhibition against Arizona
in Las Vegas with a four-run lead. Two Dodger errors helped the
Diamondbacks pull to within two runs, putting Gagne in a jam, but he
retired the side with no further damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was nice for him to experience problems in the ninth
inning, because that's what the ninth inning is all about," said Dave
Wallace, Dodger senior vice president of baseball operations and
formerly their pitching coach. "The tying run was at the plate, and
you have to get the guy out."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne, who has only 10 career relief appearances, also said the
experience was valuable.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go through some innings like that," he said. "It's
not always going to be perfect. You have to go through it and learn
from it, and that's what I tried to do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Expectations are always high for Barry Bonds, the only baseball
player to win four most-valuable-player awards, but the San Francisco
slugger admits to some trepidation when he ponders the consequences
of setting the bar in Sergei Bubka territory with his record-setting
73-homer season in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wait for that one year that's going to be bad," said
Bonds, whose previous season high was 49 homers in 2000. "That's why
I'm always pushing my body and pushing myself to the fullest. I know
it's going to happen one day. I just don't know when. Sometimes I
wonder if the people are going to be appreciative then. I'm only
human.</TE>
<TE>   "When you do something of that magnitude, you're proud of it,
you're happy. I'm proud that I did it in a place where I'm happy
doing it. I'm proud that San Francisco could say they had it. But you
just want San Francisco to be proud of you as a player, period,
regardless of what you do, and appreciate something that came once
and may never come again."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was so worked up about those expectations in early March
that he found his hands shaking during a spring-training at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't the same," Bonds said, "because I had never done
anything like last year before. I've hit 30 home runs, 40 home runs.
I know that's something I can do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With five left-handed pitchers on his roster, Tracy believes he's
a little better equipped to handle the power in a division that
includes left-handed sluggers such as Bonds, Arizona's Luis Gonzalez
and Colorado's Todd Helton and Larry Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Nunez, a Rule 5 draft pick who had never pitched above Class
A, was the lone Dodger left-hander entering last season, but Tracy
will have two left-handed starters, Odalis Perez and Kazuhisa Ishii,
and three left-handed relievers, Jesse Orosco, Terry Mulholland and
Omar Daal, to start 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives me an opportunity to situational pitch a couple times
in a game," Tracy said. "That's a nice option to have in the National
League West."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hiram Bocachica won a job as a utility player and right-handed
pinch-hitter with a late surge this spring. In 133 at-bats last
season, Bocachica hit .233 with two homers, 11 doubles and nine runs
batted in. He had a pinch-hit double Saturday against Cleveland and
went 14 for 49 with a homer and six RBIs this spring.</TE>

<HD>This Could Be the Start of Some Dream Gig</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After years in minors, Roberts, 29, gets his big
break as Dodger opening-day center fielder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"And now, the starting lineup for your Los Angeles Dodgers--leading
off, and playing center field, No. 30, Dave Roberts ... "</LD>
<LD>   When he hears those words from the Dodger Stadium public address
announcer before today's season opener against the San Francisco
Giants, all those summers in Visalia, Jacksonville, Akron and
Buffalo, all those years of trying to emerge from the shadow of
six-time all-star Kenny Lofton, will melt away.</LD>
<LD>   Dave Roberts has finally made it.</LD>
<TE>   In his ninth year of professional baseball, after 798 minor league
games and 3,079 minor league at-bats and a batch of late-March
disappointments, the former UCLA standout will make his first big
league opening-day start today.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be Roberts' major league debut--the 5-foot-10, 180-pound
speedster played in 75 games for the Cleveland Indians in the last
three seasons--but this is the first time he's broken camp with a big
league team and has a starting job to call his own.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing in the big leagues was a dream come true, but to play on
opening day in Los Angeles is off the charts," Roberts said. "This is
something I can't describe. It didn't even seem like this was
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was probably fourth on the center-field depth chart when
camp opened, behind Marquis Grissom and his guaranteed $5-million
contract, Tom Goodwin and his $3.25-million contract, and McKay
Christensen and his short-but-successful track record of hitting .327
in 28 games for the Dodgers last season.</TE>
<TE>   But the more Manager Jim Tracy saw of Roberts, the more Roberts,
29, seemed the solution to filling a four-year void at the top of the
Dodger order.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts hit .368 with a .478 on-base percentage, nine runs, three
doubles, five runs batted in, eight walks, four strikeouts and six
stolen bases in 18 Grapefruit League games.</TE>
<TE>   He worked counts, bunted for hits and ran the bases aggressively.
He got good jumps and ran good routes in the outfield, and although
he doesn't have the world's best arm, he hit cutoff men and threw to
the right bases.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Grissom was sent to the bench, Goodwin and Christensen
were designated for assignment, and Roberts, acquired for two minor
league pitchers in a winter trade with Cleveland, is still standing.</TE>
<TE>   "He sent a clear message that he's the guy to play center field
and lead off," Tracy said. "We weren't asking for things from that
position, we were demanding things. From the beginning of camp, his
instincts, his intelligence, his willingness to do things for the
club to be successful stood out.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can do those things to the level he's done them in spring
training, he could be a valuable addition and something this team
hasn't had since Brett Butler [who led off from 1991-97] was here."</TE>
<TE>   In Roberts, Tracy sees a lot of Paul Lo Duca, the Dodger catcher
who spent eight years in the minor leagues before winning a starting
job in spring training last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca batted .320 with 25 homers and 90 runs batted in after a
manager finally gave him a chance. Tracy thinks Roberts can have a
similar breakthrough season, though no one expects him to approach Lo
Duca's power numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger leadoff batters--mostly Goodwin and Grissom--combined for a
.306 on-base percentage in 2001, 15th among 16 National League teams,
but Tracy believes Roberts and speedy No. 2 batter Cesar Izturis will
bring some energy and a run-producing punch to a sluggish offense.</TE>
<TE>   But to do that, they have to get on base a lot. Roberts had a .381
career on-base percentage and a .295 batting average in the minor
leagues and has a .292 on-base percentage and a .242 average in the
big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't give at-bats away, if I have a game plan, positive
things will happen," Roberts said. "Being a leadoff hitter, it's not
just about getting hits, it's about getting on base. And sometimes if
you don't get on, it's about seeing a lot of pitches so your
teammates get a feel for what the pitcher is throwing. I just have to
play my game."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, a former three-sport star at Rancho Buena Vista High in
North San Diego County, didn't get much of a chance to play his game
in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "When the guy you're playing behind is making $8 million a year,
that's a pretty good-sized road block," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   That barrier was removed for a month in 1999, when Lofton was on
the disabled list. Roberts was recalled from triple-A Buffalo and
installed as the Indians' regular center fielder for 32 games, during
which he hit .248 and stole 10 bases, showing flashes of brilliance.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts had three hits and scored three runs in his big league
debut against Tampa Bay on Aug. 7 that year and had nine multihit
games from Aug. 7-Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   He played solid defense, created some havoc on the basepaths, and
his hard-nosed style of play endeared him to Indian fans, who
considered Roberts such a mirror image of Lofton that they started
calling him "Lenny Clofton."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was flattered.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a couple of different nicknames," he said. "But anytime
you can be compared to a perennial all-star, it's a compliment."</TE>
<TE>   Though Roberts was something of a Lofton clone, former Indian
second baseman Roberto Alomar made the bigger impression on Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me to not be afraid to make a mistake, that you can't
always have a great game but you can always do something positive to
help the team win," Roberts said. "Whether he went 0 for 4 or four
for four, he always did something to help the team. He told me to be
fearless, to put pressure on the defense."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy told Roberts the same thing this spring. Roberts stole 65
bases for Class-A Visalia in 1996 and 39 for triple-A Buffalo in 1999
and again in 2000. He has an explosive first step--"It takes him one
step to reach full speed," Tracy said--and will have the green light
most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the luxury of Trace letting me be aggressive," Roberts
said. "I've always been a base stealer. That's a big part of my
game."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts knows he'll be under a microscope in Los Angeles. He's
never experienced the physical and mental rigors of a full big league
season, and there will be questions as to whether he will be exposed
by a steady stream of major league pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't proven I can play in the big leagues for six months ...
but I think that's overrated, because if you can't get up to play 162
games in the big leagues, there's something wrong with you," Roberts
said. "I've played too long in the minor leagues to give it away
now."</TE>

<LD>* Gates open: Parking lots, 10:40 a.m.; stadium turnstiles, 11:10
a.m.</LD>
<LD>   * Ceremonial first pitch: Peter O'Malley, who succeeded his
father, Walter, as Dodger president in 1970 and held the post until
1998. Peter's mother, Kate, threw out the first pitch 40 years ago
before the season opener in 1962, the club's first year at Dodger
Stadium. The Cincinnati Reds won that game, 6-3.</LD>
<LD>   * National anthem: Patti LaBelle.</LD>
<TE>   * Other ceremonies: The team will honor members of its 1962 squad,
including hall of famer Duke Snider, Maury Wills, Tommy Davis and
Johnny Podres. In 1962, Wills stole a then-record 104 bases, Davis
led the National League with a .346 batting average and the Dodgers
finished tied with the Giants atop the standings. However, the
Dodgers lost a best-of-three playoff. A high school honor band made
up of students from throughout Southern California also will perform.
During the seventh-inning stretch, Erin Bradley, 3, of Vandenberg Air
Force Base will sing "God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   * Military presence: The Elite Frogs parachute team will land on
the field, and there will be a flyover by two F-14 Tomcat and two F-4
Phantom jets.</TE>
<TE>   * Something new: The outfield wall will feature the greatest
moments in Dodger Stadium's 40-year history.</TE>
<TE>   * Opening-day memories: Today's season-opening start will be Kevin
Brown's third with the Dodgers, who are 24-20 in season openers since
moving to Los Angeles. In Brown's first start for them, the Dodgers
rallied for a dramatic, 11-inning 8-6 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks in 1999 at Dodger Stadium.... The last time the Dodgers
lost a home opener was in 1997, when Curt Schilling, then with the
Philadelphia Phillies, beat them, 3-0.... Don't expect any help from
last year's Dodger heroes in today's game. In a 1-0 victory over the
visiting Milwaukee Brewers, Gary Sheffield (traded to the Atlanta
Braves) homered in the sixth inning, starter Chan Ho Park (signed as
a free agent by the Texas Rangers) went seven scoreless innings and
Jeff Shaw (retired) pitched a perfect ninth for the save. It marked
the Dodgers' fourth consecutive victory in a home opener.... In
opening-day ceremonies in 1972, the Dodgers retired uniform numbers
for the first time in franchise history: Sandy Koufax (32), Roy
Campanella (39) and Jackie Robinson (42).... Koufax pitched only one
season opener, in 1964, the year after the Dodgers swept the Yankees
in the World Series and he won the first of his three Cy Young
awards. Koufax beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-0, at Dodger
Stadium.... Right-handers Don Drysdale and Don Sutton lead the team
in opening-day starts with seven each.</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at Marylands' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Neither team was pristine. Missed free throws haunted
the Hoosiers. Turnovers and missed shots down low hurt the Terrapins.
The Hoosiers looked like tortoises in the beginning, scoring only
eight points in the first nine minutes. Maryland, meanwhile, looked
too big and too strong, pushing the Hoosiers around on the inside,
swatting shots and clearing offensive rebounds with ease en route to
a 19-8 lead. But Indiana's three-point shooting--what else?--kept the
game from being a 20-point halftime blowout. Indiana made only four
of 20 two-point attempts, but was five for eight from three-point
range. After its initial surge, Maryland struggled from close range
and couldn't put Indiana away, going more than six minutes without a
basket and missing several easy shots down low until Chris Wilcox
made a short jumper with 2:56 left. Indiana closed with a 7-2 run to
end the half, including a running bank shot by Tom Coverdale as the
horn sounded.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: With Indiana already flailing on offense,
Jared Jeffries picked up his second foul with 12:03 left. He sat down
with only two points, costing the Hoosiers their top inside threat
until he returned almost eight minutes later. He missed a free throw
and then went back to the bench for the final 1:12.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Maryland guard Juan Dixon came in as the
tournament's leading scorer with 27.4 points a game and didn't
disappoint in the first half with 11 points on four-for-four
shooting. He also made both of his free-throw attempts and had three
steals.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Indiana made only two of seven free throws.
Maryland committed 10 turnovers; Indiana wasn't exactly flawless with
nine. Indiana forward Jim Newton scored a career-high 19 points in
the semifinal against Oklahoma but had only two at halftime against
Maryland. Maryland forward Lonny Baxter missed five shots in a 1:25
span, including back-to-back missed layups with just over four
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Indiana: Kyle Hornsby and Coverdale, 8 points.
Maryland: Dixon, 11.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Indiana: Dane Fife, 4: Maryland: Baxter, 9.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>To his King teammates, Bryan Smolinski is known as "Smoke." So, with
the veteran center mired in the longest goal-scoring drought of his
career, it can be said that the King offense has been Smokeless for
months.</LD>
<LD>   It's a growing source of frustration for Coach Andy Murray.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess he's yet to deserve it," Murray said Monday, searching
for an answer to why Smolinski has not scored a goal since Jan. 17, a
span of 27 games. "You could say whatever: He's not shooting fast
enough; he's not shooting hard enough; he's not shooting accurate
enough--everything that goes into scoring goals. Is he going into the
traffic areas? I don't know if it's one particular thing.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been certainly getting his opportunities lately. He's hit a
couple of goal posts, had a great chance at Calgary in the slot.
There's usually a reason for things, and it's usually that you're not
deserving. He has to do more to deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger, sidelined since Jan. 15 because of a left wrist
injury, is expected to return to the lineup tonight against the
Vancouver Canucks.... Defenseman Aaron Miller, who sat out the last
two periods of Saturday's 5-3 loss to the Calgary Flames after
suffering a right rib strain, did not practice Monday and his status
for tonight's game will be determined today.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the 10 games since Samaki Walker was activated from the injured
list, Coach Phil Jackson has started him at power forward three
times.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Horry, the veteran bench player who averaged 10.2 points
and 8.1 rebounds in the 13 games Walker missed because of a
hyperextended elbow, has started the others.</LD>
<LD>   Although it sometimes appears that Jackson has a matchup in
mind--Walker started both games against San Antonio, Horry both
against Dallas--it is not that complicated. "I usually go talk to
Robert about it, see how he's doing," Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   In the last six weeks, however, Jackson, when he sees an odd gait
from Horry, has resisted the urge to replace his veteran forward, who
often plays better as the game progresses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Richmond returns tonight to Washington, where he spent three
seasons before having his contract bought out by the Wizards, which
allowed him to sign with the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Never really in Jackson's rotation, Richmond has not played in
five of the last six games, running to 13 the number of games he has
not played because of the coach's decision. "There'll be
opportunities at some point still," Jackson said.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: Game tonight might be their last chance to
match skills with Jordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Lakers stand across from Michael Jordan for perhaps the last time
tonight. For the third time around.</LD>
<LD>   Unless, of course, the knee, which recently celebrated its 39th
year by submitting to a repair job by local surgeons, heals, and
assuming Jordan does not step in a gopher hole striding up the 18th
fairway at Pebble Beach this summer. Then there will be next
year--and the fourth time.</LD>
<LD>   Unless, of course, the Washington Wizards make the playoffs, which
could get him to thinking about what more he could do in shorts and,
well, then he'd have accomplished what it was he left his closet of
suits for. Who knows then?</LD>
<TE>   If it is becoming difficult to follow the man, perhaps it is
because The Times does not employ a Michael Jordan beat writer, not
to be confused with a Washington Wizard beat writer. The Washington
Post has one of each, often standing side by side, notepad by
notepad.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Lakers continue their on-again, off-again quest for
home-court advantage in the first of four rounds of the playoffs. The
Wizards, out of the playoffs since 1997, arrive tonight 21/2 games
and two teams out of the Eastern Conference's eighth and final
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers appear to have decided that early-round games at
Staples Center are pleasant but not critical. This four-game
trip--stops in New Jersey, Boston and Miami follow Washington--could
go a long way toward determining if the Western Conference finals
will open in Sacramento or Los Angeles, should it come to that. The
Lakers sit two losses behind the Kings, with the season's final game
against the Kings in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They have won five of six games since they lost twice in Texas.
And, they haven't lost to a good team since then, which, if you
follow the Lakers closely, makes perfect sense.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting there," Shaquille O'Neal said on the way to his car
Sunday night. "I know once the playoffs come, our guys will have a
whole different energy and a whole different adrenaline."</TE>
<TE>   Their guys say the same about O'Neal, perhaps headed for
off-season surgery on his rigid big toe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that he pick his spots, and he does that," Kobe
Bryant said. "He waits for the right time to suck up the pain, to
make the necessary slides defensively."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan could be making those same decisions, asking his knees for
enough to compete, for enough lift for his jump shots, for just
enough to push the Wizards past Toronto and Indiana (or Philadelphia)
in the next nine games. He came off the bench Sunday and scored 10
points in 28 minutes in the Wizards' 110-103 loss to Dallas, two days
after scoring 34 points in 26 minutes against the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "He could find a way to play even though he's limited," said Laker
Coach Phil Jackson, Jordan's coach for six championships in Chicago.
"All he wants his team to do, I'm sure, is get to the playoffs. He'd
like to help lead that charge, as long as he's been part of the team
all year and committed himself, I'm sure he wants to have an outcome
of success."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Jackson said, "I think then he'll assess where his
knee is at. In this case, very often they go in--and I'm not trying
to say anything about it--but at some point in time, there's
arthritis, and there's not a whole lot of cushion there for the knee.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of how much you want to rehabilitate the knee, the
knee is only going to be able to do so much. You start getting bone
on bone when you're out there on the court, to me there's not a whole
lot you can do."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are taking unsteady steps as well, trying to live with
O'Neal's condition and, subsequently, curious about whence the
rebounds and defensive stops will come. They beat Sacramento,
Portland and San Antonio in eight days, but the Kings lacked Peja
Stojakovic and the Trail Blazers played without Rasheed Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   "The Portland game doesn't count because Rasheed didn't play,"
Laker forward Robert Horry said. "We didn't take them out like we
should have. We played all right [against San Antonio]. We could've
played a lot better. I'll tell you when we get back from this road
trip if we are where we should be."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach State turned to Larry Reynolds as its men's basketball
coach, a man who has a glowing record in NCAA Division II and has
established ties to the Southern California recruiting scene.</LD>
<LD>   Reynolds was introduced to the media and 49er supporters Monday at
the Pyramid. He signed a five-year contract with an annual base
salary of $165,000 along with incentives that can push the deal to
nearly $200,000.</LD>
<LD>   Reynolds, 48, led Cal State San Bernardino to a 110-35 record,
three California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships and two
Elite Eight berths in five seasons. San Bernardino finished a
program-best 28-2 this season, losing in the national quarterfinals.</LD>
<TE>   He spent 16 years as an assistant at UC Riverside and two at San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Long Beach State should be in the race for the [Big West]
conference title and get into the NCAA tournament or the NIT year in
and year out," Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State Athletic Director Bill Shumard had sought an
experienced head coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted someone who was a solid teacher in sound fundamentals
... somebody with a good reputation in Southern California, so that
we can restore our recruiting reputation in the place where we do
business," Shumard said.</TE>

<DH>Top 10 Moments of 2002 NCAA Tournament Are a Reminder of
What Hooks In So Many</DH>

<LD>Turtles Take It All</LD>
<LD>   1 As the final seconds of the national championship game ticked
away with Maryland Coach Gary Williams still sweating the details
despite an insurmountable lead over Indiana, forward Chris Wilcox put
his arm around Williams and playfully mussed his hair. A year after
losing to Duke in the Final Four semifinals, determined Maryland had
won its first NCAA title, 64-52.</LD>
<LD>   Duke's Last Gasp</LD>
<TE>   2 With the defending champions' season on the line, so was Jason
Williams--once more. With 4.2 seconds left and one free throw to tie
Indiana after being fouled as he made three-point shot, Williams
missed--and everybody's All-American was a goat from the line yet
again after Duke's regional semifinal loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin Barnes-Burner</TE>
<TE>   3 Top-seeded Cincinnati fell to UCLA in double overtime, and the
Bruins reached the Sweet 16 in their annual revival. The comeback
against Cincinnati started when Matt Barnes made two three-point
shots in five seconds for a six-point possession aided by a Bearcat
foul--turning an 11-point Cincinnati lead into a mere five-point
edge.</TE>
<TE>   Hoosiers' New Horizon</TE>
<TE>   4 Two tumultuous seasons after Bob Knight's firing, Indiana's
seemingly endless supply of three-point shooters overwhelmed Kent
State in the South Regional final. Coach Mike Davis, so recently
beleaguered, carried the game ball to the stands to present it to
university President Myles Brand--the man who fired Knight and later
hired Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Idol Time</TE>
<TE>   5 Creighton's Terrell Taylor paid homage to the Michael Jordan
statue outside Chicago's United Center, then pulled a Jordan move
inside when he helped upset Florida in double overtime in the first
round with a last-second three-pointer. And yes, he wears No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Turtle Waxed</TE>
<TE>   6 That's how the Kansas City Star put it after the Jayhawks'
semifinal loss to Maryland in the Final Four. Down by 11 early
against Kansas, Maryland Coach Gary Williams bent his players' ears
during a timeout, and Juan Dixon and the rest of the Terrapin terrors
roared back to lead by as many as 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's Move</TE>
<TE>   7 The more things change, the more they stay the same. Knight
turned a 9-19 Texas Tech team into an NCAA tournament team in one
season--only to lose to Southern Illinois in the first round, his
fifth first-round loss in his past seven tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Basketball Jones</TE>
<TE>   8 The final seconds ticked down against Texas, and the Ducks did
exactly what they did against USC and UCLA the last week of the
regular season: They gave the ball to Frederick Jones. He drove the
lane and lofted a runner that bounced around the rim and fell in for
a 72-70 victory that sent Oregon to the Midwest Regional final
against Kansas. The road ended there, one victory short of the Final
Four.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga Goes Home</TE>
<TE>   9 Long after the last three-point shot went awry in the 'Zags'
first-round flame-out against Wyoming, All-American guard Dan Dickau
stood in the locker room, eyes still red, his career over. "I still
believe we're one of the 10 best teams in the country," he said. "I
guess I'll spend the next two weeks trying not to watch too much of
the NCAA tournament.... For me, that's difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Dry Tank in Sacramento</TE>
<TE>   10 Visions of a Duke showdown and a trip to the Final Four danced
in the Trojans' minds. But USC came up empty in the first round
against North Carolina Wilmington, burning out in overtime after
having to come from 19 behind against one of the lesser lights of the
University of North Carolina system.</TE>

<LD>Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers worked out briefly, but
it was unclear whether his sore back would allow him to play tonight
at Golden State.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace has missed three out of the last four games because of a
strained lower back, which he first injured in a victory at Minnesota
on March 23.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Wallace stretched, ran and shot baskets at practice but
did not take part in full-court drills.</LD>
<TE>   Baron Davis, stuck in a walking boot during downtime because of a
strained foot, needs rest to heal his injury.</TE>
<TE>   With four games in five days and the Charlotte Hornets in a tight
playoff push, he's not going to get any.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares, we've got to win," Davis said. "You can't complain
about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown was fined $10,000 for
criticizing officials and Sam Cassell of the Milwaukee Bucks was
fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct for kicking the ball.</TE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>In an age when more underclassmen are leaving school early for the
draft, Maryland won its first national title with an almost unheard
of three senior starters.</LD>
<LD>   Shooting guard Juan Dixon and center Lonny Baxter both arrived in
College Park in 1998, and small forward Byron Mouton showed up on the
scene in 1999 as a transfer from Tulane.</LD>
<LD>   All three said that while they enjoyed their respective college
years, they also suggested that younger players should judge for
themselves whether they stay in school or bolt for the allure of the
NBA's riches.</LD>
<TE>   "I developed as a basketball player and as a person each year,"
Dixon said. "I grew up in college."</TE>
<TE>   Said Baxter: "Everybody has different situations, different things
they have to face.... [College] was the best four years of my life.
We just finished it off tonight the way it should be done."</TE>
<TE>   Mouton had a different experience as a transfer who had to sit out
a year at Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me five years to understand what it takes to win," Mouton
said. "And that's what we did tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maryland Coach Gary Williams became the ninth coach in NCAA
history to lead his alma mater to a national title. The last coach to
do it was Norm Sloan, who led North Carolina State to the national
title in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Williams graduated from Maryland in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   Why hasn't Maryland won a title before?</TE>
<TE>   "Things have never worked out right," Williams said. "This year
they did. I hope everybody feels a part of that because it's the
result of a lot of hard work."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Dufresne</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Bob Knight was fired as Indiana coach 18 months
ago, there was talk of assistants Mike Davis and John Treloar
becoming co-coaches. Not only was Treloar, 45, more experienced, he
had coached Davis as a player at Alabama and in the CBA.</TE>
<TE>   But Treloar said Davis should replace Knight. Now he has full
control over the Hoosier defense and makes some of the game decisions
without having to deal with the pressure of following Knight's
footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the freedom to do anything he wants to do on this team,"
Davis said. "If he wants to make a sub, he'll tell me. He's a great
coach."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart made his double-duty plans official Monday, saying he
will not drive in the Indianapolis 500.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion, will compete only
in the Coca-Cola 600 and not make a third attempt at the grueling
1,100 miles of racing.</LD>
<LD>   He cited his desire to win the Winston Cup championship this year
and his shot at a $1-million bonus if he wins the 600, for not
entering the Indy 500.</LD>
<TE>   "Running Indy again is something I've put a lot of thought into,
but when it came right down to it, the long-term goal of winning the
Winston Cup championship won out," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is 12th in the Winston Cup standings, 204 behind leader
Sterling Marlin.</TE>

<TE>   The Denver Broncos have confirmed they have signed free-agent wide

<TE>   Moore, 33, missed most of the last two seasons in Arizona with
injuries and was released by the Cardinals in February.</TE>
<TE>   He is a two-time all-pro and has caught 628 passes for 9,368 yards
and 49 touchdowns in a 10-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer Folau, who started 15 games at left tackle for Miami last
year, has signed a two-year contract with the New Orleans Saints,
becoming one possible replacement for the departed Willie Roaf.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Dolphins signed their lone free agent, tight end Jed
Weaver, to a one-year contract.... The Cleveland Browns have signed
offensive tackle Barry Stokes, who played last season with the Green
Bay Packers.... Former NFL general manager Bobby Beathard joined the

<TE>   Hillsborough Circuit Court Judge Florence Foster denied bail for
Strawberry while he awaits an April 18 court date on allegations he
broke rules at the drug treatment center where he was serving two
years of house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Dominic Rhodes, who led the Indianapolis Colts in rushing last

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Teams Want Their Cut of the Postseason Cake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the Kings and other teams fighting for their postseason lives, it
may be hard to believe that there are people who believe that making
the Stanley Cup playoffs is a piece of cake.</LD>
<LD>   That might have been true years ago, when three or four sub-.500
teams made the playoffs every spring.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, with 30 teams and 16 playoff berths available, making
the cut is a lot tougher. In the Western Conference, there probably
will be at least two teams with winning records left behind. The
Kings are hoping they won't be one of them. But after going 0-3-1 on
their recent four-game trip, they no longer are a postseason lock.</LD>
<TE>   Including tonight's game against Vancouver, six of the Kings'
seven remaining games will be against teams with better than .500
records, and the seventh game is against the Mighty Ducks, who would
love nothing more than to knock their Southern California rivals out
of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game is so crucial now," King Coach Andy Murray said last
week. "Points are so hotly contested."</TE>
<TE>   Another team in jeopardy is the Dallas Stars, who are crawling
down the stretch after going 1-2-2 in their last five games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of cracks this season, which we haven't had in
the past," center Mike Modano said about the Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas, which has won five consecutive Pacific Division titles, is
in 10th place in the conference but the Stars are not ready to be
left out of the playoffs for the first time since 1995-96.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not done yet," Dallas winger Brenden Morrow said. "We still
have a couple of games in hand and we can make these points up."</TE>
<TE>   But like the Kings, Dallas does not have an easy schedule. Five of
the Stars' last seven games are against winning teams, among them
road games against the Kings and Colorado, the defending Stanley Cup
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Going in the right direction are the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver
Canucks, the league's hottest teams heading into the last two weeks
of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton is unbeaten in its last eight games (7-0-1-0) and getting
solid play from goaltender Tommy Salo. But the key to the Oilers'
turnaround has been the play of forwards Mike Comrie, Anson Carter
and Ryan Smyth, who have regained their early-season offensive touch.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton, in eighth place in the West, has a favorable schedule,
with four of its remaining games against non-playoff clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver is right behind the Oilers in ninth place and has won
eight of its last 11. The Canucks have been a streaky team all season
and captain Markus Naslund feels good about their playoff chances.</TE>
<TE>   "If we keep winning like this, I don't think the other teams can
keep going, keep winning the same way," Naslund said after the
Canucks defeated the Ducks on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   After tonight's game against the Kings, the Canucks will play two
of their last five against sub-.500 teams, so Naslund could be right.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix and St. Louis, who played each other Monday night, are
trying to maintain their playoff positions.</TE>
<TE>   Behind goaltender Sean Burke, the Coyotes have surged since the
Olympic break. But they will have to get it done the hard way with
four of their final six games on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues also will have to earn their playoff berth, what with
four of their last seven games against Detroit, Colorado or San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   And in the East ...</TE>
<TE>   The playoff picture in the Eastern Conference isn't as complicated
but it has an interesting story line, the Montreal Canadiens being
locked with Washington in a struggle for the final berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens are trying to reach the playoffs for the first time
in four years and have been playing with the added motivation
provided by teammate Saku Koivu.</TE>
<TE>   Koivu, battling back from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that went into
remission in early February, is traveling with the Canadiens on their
two-game road swing.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really excited, it's my first trip with the team," Koivu
told Montreal reporters over the weekend. "I'll practice with my
teammates and try to push it. That's the best way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Koivu, who went through eight sessions of chemotherapy, hopes to
be able to return to the lineup for the Canadiens' last two games of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally you need two months before you can get back to a normal
life," Koivu said. "But for me, I was lucky to start feeling better
as soon as the treatments were over. Up until now, there hasn't been
any setbacks."</TE>
<TE>   And the Canadiens are hoping that Koivu's health continues to
improve, whether they make the playoffs or not.</TE>
<TE>   Only in the NHL</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the national media attention the NBA and Clippers would
have received if 20-year old Darius Miles had been cited for underage
drinking and driving. Not only would the league have been ripped
again for drafting players directly out of high school, but the
Clippers would have been criticized for not keeping a closer watch on
their players.</TE>
<TE>   The NHL and the Minnesota Wild had no such problem when forward
Marian Gaborik was caught in a similar situation earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   According to a police report, Gaborik, who turned 20 on Feb. 14,
was stopped March 4 in Woodbury, Minn., because the license plate
registration on his car had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Gaborik had to take a breath test because he smelled of alcohol
and his blood-alcohol level was .055%, well below the state's legally
drunk level of .10%. Gaborik was issued a misdemeanor citation and
released.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota General Manager Doug Risebrough said he decided not to
take any disciplinary action after discussing the incident with
Gaborik, who happens to lead the Wild in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw how extremely disappointed he was," Risebrough said.</TE>
<TE>   "He explained how much he regretted what he did, and that was
enough for me."</TE>
<TE>   Changing of the Guard</TE>
<TE>   If Calgary winger Jarome Iginla, who leads the league in goals and
points, is able to hold onto his scoring lead, he'll become the first
player not named Jaromir Jagr, Mario Lemieux or Wayne Gretzky to take
home the league's Art Ross Trophy in more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   The last person, other than one of those three, to lead the NHL in
points was the Kings' Marcel Dionne in 1979-80.</TE>
<TE>   Iginla, who needs only four goals in seven games to reach 50, said
after having scored two goals in beating the Kings on Saturday that
he's getting excited about winning the scoring title.</TE>

<HD>Vaughn Hitless, but Mets Prevail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though the big hits were bloopers, the New York Mets' revamped
lineup produced more than enough runs to win on opening day.</LD>
<LD>   Newcomers Roberto Alomar and Roger Cedeno drove in runs with soft
hits and Al Leiter gave up one unearned run in six innings and the
Mets defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, 6-2, Monday at Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "This is something we can anticipate on many nights," said Leiter,
who got little run support last season. "All the runs don't have to
come on three-run homers or bombs from the middle of the lineup. It's
a collective effort. I'll take six runs every time."</LD>
<TE>   The Mets didn't have many days like this last season, when they
scored three or fewer runs in nearly half their games. But General
Manager Steve Phillips overhauled the lowest-scoring offense in the
majors by adding Alomar, Cedeno, Mo Vaughn and Jeromy Burnitz.</TE>
<TE>   The four new starters struggled, going two for 17 with nine
strikeouts, including an 0-for-5 and two-strikeout performance from
former Angel Vaughn. But Cedeno blooped a run-scoring double in a
three-run second inning and Alomar had a soft, two-run single in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful day," Alomar said. "The big stage, the fans know
the game. It's really important to start on the right foot."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Chicago 4--Aaron Boone hit a bases-loaded sacrifice
fly in the bottom of the ninth off Jeff Fassero in the opener of the
Reds' final season at Cinergy Field.</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Juan Encarnacion misjudged a fly ball, helping the
Cubs rally for two runs to tie the score in the eighth. The crowd of
41,913 and the construction workers building the new ballpark were
hugging when the Reds pulled it out.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 10, Colorado 2--Albert Pujols, last year's National
League rookie of the year, broke open a tight game with a three-run
double in the fourth inning and the Cardinals battered Rockies'
starter Mike Hampton at St. Louis.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder Brian Giles sat out the Pirates' season
opener against the New York Mets after straining a muscle in his
right side during batting practice.</LD>
<LD>   "I was taking a swing and felt something grab on the side," Giles
said. "I came out and had [the trainer] rub it out, but it never
loosened up."</LD>
<LD>   Giles was replaced in left field by Armando Rios, who went one for
two in Pittsburgh's 6-2 loss. Giles, sidelined four games in 1999
with a similar injury, is day-to-day.</LD>
<TE>   "I think I caught it in time so it's not a three- to four-week
thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Padre third baseman Sean Burroughs was a late scratch
from the lineup against the Arizona Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bruce Bochy said Burroughs' jammed right thumb was
improved enough that he would have played, but he came down with flu.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also played without outfielder Ryan Klesko and
right-hander Bobby Jones because they were suspended for their
involvement in a brawl against the Angels in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Moises Alou, who strained his right calf during an
exhibition game last weekend, was scratched from the Chicago Cub
lineup against Cincinnati. Alou might be ready to play Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Williams Passes This History Test</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Forgive Gary Williams if he was still gesturing, still pointing to
his head shouting, "Think," still sweating it out in the final minute
or so even though Maryland was up 15.</LD>
<LD>   You have to understand, it was the first national championship for
the Terrapins in his lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   Make that anybody's lifetime.</LD>
<TE>   Lefty Driesell arrived in 1969 saying he'd make Maryland "the UCLA
of the East."</TE>
<TE>   A generation later, it's one title down, 10 to go.</TE>
<TE>   Williams graduated from Maryland in 1968, and returned in 1989,
during the darkest of days.</TE>
<TE>   Len Bias had died in 1986, his cocaine-induced death coming
perhaps 48 hours after he'd been the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, Driesell was forced out, renowned Baltimore high
school coach Bob Wade took over, and by the time Williams arrived,
Maryland was on its way to NCAA probation.</TE>
<TE>   That's why there was more than celebration on the court for
Williams and seniors Juan Dixon and Lonny Baxter Monday night after
Maryland's 64-52 victory over Indiana in the Georgia Dome.</TE>
<TE>   That was release.</TE>
<TE>   All those years of chasing Dean Smith, all that Duke obsession.
Over.</TE>
<TE>   "The program came a long ways," said Dixon, who played through
only four years of it, but grew up in Baltimore. "They were in a lot
of trouble, I guess, in the late '80s. Coach came in and did a great
job. We're one of the better programs in the country right now.
That's a credit to the guy to my right."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely wanted to get Coach a ring," said Baxter, from
Silver Spring, Md. "This was his year. It's about time. He got what
he deserved."</TE>
<TE>   For years all Williams got was also-ran status--no ACC team from
outside of North Carolina had ever won the NCAA title until Monday
night--and a lot of grief about his sideline insanity.</TE>
<TE>   But two hours before Monday's championship game, that lunatic you
saw later was playing with his 2-year-old grandson.</TE>
<TE>   "He was down on the floor, playing trains with David," said
Kristin Scott, Williams' daughter.</TE>
<TE>   He found it calming, because little David didn't know Granddaddy
had yet to win the Big One, or that Duke came from 22 points down to
beat Maryland in the semifinals last year.</TE>
<TE>   A kinder, gentler Gary? His daughter laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a relative term," she said. "He still gets pretty fired up
and emotional. It's all relative."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for people who weren't around Maryland basketball in
1986 to understand how devastating Bias' unexpected death was. Jay
Bilas and Brad Daugherty, both ESPN analysts now, played in the ACC
at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "Bias was Superman to me," said Bilas, who played at Duke and
considered Bias a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It profoundly affected not only the Maryland program, but college
basketball in general. It took a long time for Maryland to recover.
They only really got there after Keith Booth and Joe Smith came in."</TE>
<TE>   Daugherty played at North Carolina and was the No. 1 pick in the
NBA draft that year, and he and Bias had both signed big deals with
Reebok. He was leaving for an event he and Bias were to appear at
together in Boston when he heard Bias had died.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at Raleigh-Durham airport and someone told me, and I said,
'Man, I don't believe it,'" Daugherty said.</TE>
<TE>   "So many things happened after that. So much negativity. Then
Lefty was gone. Things were tough. They never recovered--but here
they are now."</TE>
<TE>   For that, make Williams a lifetime member of the alumni society.</TE>
<TE>   "I came back at a time I hate to even think about, because there
was so much mistrust, so much doubt about the place of the basketball
team at the university," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to work all those things out before we could even think
about having a good basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins sunk to 14-15 in 1992 and 12-16 in 1993--2-14 in the
unforgiving Atlantic Coast Conference. In 1993, Williams landed Joe
Smith and Keith Booth, and Maryland was on its way back. The
Terrapins made the Sweet 16 in 1994, and six times altogether,
breaking through for the school's first Final Four last year.</TE>
<TE>   It took one more before they got it right.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who played back then, Walt Williams, people like that,
had a lot to do with keeping the crowd at Cole Field House even
though we couldn't participate in the NCAA tournament or be on
television," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always remember those guys as well as the guys that played
on this team. I'm not sure if we could have recovered if it weren't
for the people involved back there, say from '90 to '93."</TE>
<TE>   It was a school with a great basketball heritage, just no case
full of trophies to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins were ranked in the top five in 1974 and 1975, but
they didn't play in the NCAA tournament in 1974, the year ACC
champion North Carolina State won the national championship with
David Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been so many good teams," Williams said. "When Lefty was
coaching, the rules were different. It was so hard to make the
tournament. They probably were the second or third best team in the
country a couple years and didn't get into the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have never worked out quite right. This year they did. I
hope everybody feels a part of that because it's the result of a lot
of hard work. But it's a lot about getting that feeling back that we
could be as good as anyone in the country. I think you have to feel
that way."</TE>
<TE>   There was no doubt they did.</TE>
<TE>   When Indiana tied the score, at 40-40, then led ever so briefly,
Dixon didn't crack. Neither did the others.</TE>
<TE>   "You see other schools are very happy about getting to a Sweet
16," Williams said. "We've had to live for the last couple of years
with the idea that if you don't win it all, you haven't had a great
year, even when you win 25, 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough at times. I think that's why we won tonight. It's
made everybody a little tougher."</TE>

<LD>About an hour before Maryland and Indiana did a hatchet job on Monday
night's NCAA championship game, ESPN asked viewers to play editor for
a minute.</LD>
<LD>   Trolling for a poll during its pregame show, ESPN posed the
question: "What headline is most likely to appear in Tuesday
morning's paper?"</LD>
<LD>   a) "We're Number Juan!"</LD>
<TE>   (Translation: Juan Dixon leads Maryland to the championship.)</TE>
<TE>   b) "The Baxter Factor!"</TE>
<TE>   (Lonny Baxter leads Maryland to the championship.)</TE>
<TE>   c) "Hoosier Daddy!"</TE>
<TE>   (Jared Jeffries leads Indiana to an upset victory.)</TE>
<TE>   d) "Great Dane!"</TE>
<TE>   (Dane Fife leads Indiana to an upset victory.)</TE>
<TE>   Exclamation points were flying all over the place. Bad puns too.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the basketball game that followed on CBS, it was
obvious that ESPN had blown it, ignoring the headline that would best
capture the essence of the evening. Which was:</TE>
<TE>   e) "Who Let the Dogs Out?"</TE>
<TE>   After three weeks of basking in out-of-nowhere upsets, clutch
performances and memorable finishes, CBS was handed a mutt for its
final prime-time showcase.</TE>
<TE>   One shining moment? Indiana's Hoosiers and Maryland's Terrapins
spent 40 minutes of basketball time searching for, and failing to
find, anything that might qualify.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, they did manage to answer one pressing query: How
badly can one team play and still win the NCAA championship game?</TE>
<TE>   Now we know. You can turn the ball over 16 times, as Maryland did,
and shoot 22% from three-point range, as Maryland did, and go more
than six minutes between baskets, as Maryland did, and still win the
title ... provided you are playing an opponent that also turns the
ball over 16 times and shoots 34.5% from the field and 29% from the
foul line.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, as the wild passes flew all over the Georgia Dome,
interrupted only by bobbled passes and bricked foul shots, Jim Nantz
and Billy Packer blinked, swallowed hard and groped for some
explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "Nerves all over the place," Nantz suggested early in the game.
Except, perhaps, in the case of Indiana guard Tom Coverdale, hobbled
by a sprained ankle, a fairly major injury, in Nantz's estimation.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of the nation!" Nantz called that troublesome ankle.</TE>
<TE>   But that was only until Indiana's awful foul shooting and
Maryland's horrendous ballhandling eclipsed it.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither team can settle down," Packer said, growing more
exasperated by the minute.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, however, it became clear that this was more than a case
of big-game jitters.</TE>
<TE>   This was a case of both teams playing very, very poorly. And there
was nothing Gary Williams or Mike Davis--or, worse yet--CBS could do
about it.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the NCAA final is one long parade of platitudes and
superlatives, a coronation-by-commentators. As such, Dick Enberg came
prepared with a glowing halftime tribute to the coaches who
participated in this year's NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   This was notable mainly for Bob Knight's very brief appearance in
the montage--the only reference CBS made of Knight the entire
telecast, an interesting piece of editing considering that two days
earlier during the semifinals, Nantz had chided the former Indiana
coach for failing to place a congratulatory phone call to even one of
the current Hoosier players.</TE>
<TE>   That was an atypically strong comment from Nantz, and certainly it
was a reasonable one. Nantz was posing a good question: Why hadn't
Knight kept in touch with the players he recruited to Indiana,
players completing a most unlikely ride to the NCAA title game?
Hadn't that invalidated the long-standing theory that Knight, beneath
the bluster, really cares mostly about the kids?</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, it was too strong a comment for CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, Knight was never mentioned again. You had to go to
ESPN for an explanation for Knight's curious cone of silence. During
its pregame show, ESPN ran an excerpt of an interview with Knight,
who said, "The time will come for that....To inject myself into it
[now], I think, is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Packer's journalistic instincts kicked in as Indiana
and Maryland finished a wretched first half. The game had turned so
ugly so quickly, something had to be said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the worst-played games I've ever seen in a final in a long
time," Packer said as the second half began.</TE>
<TE>   After another Indiana turnover, Packer felt compelled to point out
that the crowd's reaction was "not a boo of the play" but Maryland
fans chanting the name of Terrapin forward Byron Mouton. At the time,
it was a necessary clarification.</TE>
<TE>   Packer was hard on Maryland point guard Steve Blake, advising
Williams repeatedly to get the player out of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland, he said, "looked totally confused." Williams, he said,
"can't figure out which team he's watching.... A few years ago, he'd
have had a heart attack."</TE>
<TE>   But when Indiana failed to take advantage, allowing Dixon to
finally seize control of the game, Maryland ended the agony and
closed out a 64-52 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Strange game," Packer assessed. "One of the strangest Final Four
games I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   "Very odd," Nantz had to agree. "Out of sync from the start."</TE>
<TE>   How about that headline, then?</TE>
<TE>   Juan to Forget.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger left fielder barreled into the manager's office this
spring with a demand.</LD>
<LD>   It's not what you think.</LD>
<LD>   It's not even close.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to play," the left fielder threatened. "I don't care where
you bat me. I don't care how you use me. I just want to play."</TE>
<TE>   This is the story Jim Tracy tells when describing Brian Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   This is the only story he tells.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I need another one?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   His locker is in the same corner of the room. His position is the
same patch on the field.</TE>
<TE>   But the difference will be as clear as a collision with a second
baseman or a fence.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sheffield was about mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan is about breaking them.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield played hopscotch.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan played football.</TE>
<TE>   On this opening day, the Dodgers are careful to avoid anointing
Jordan as the replacement for the Dodgers' best, and nuttiest,
player.</TE>
<TE>   But I wish they would.</TE>
<TE>   Fans need to know that this is one chemistry class the Dodgers
didn't flunk.</TE>
<TE>   Fans need to understand that while they may have acquired only 70%
of Sheffield's instincts, they added 200% of his insides.</TE>
<TE>   That may not equate to a dramatic opening-day home run.</TE>
<TE>   But it does mean the Dodgers now have a guy who will chase down a
fly ball, break up a double play, scold a slacking rookie.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the Dodger evolution, a fair swap.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is not a contact sport," said hitting coach Jack Clark
with one of his wry smiles. "But Brian Jordan doesn't mind making it
a contact sport."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, this winter's deal with the Atlanta Braves was made
only because it included left-hander Odalis Perez, a 23-year-old kid
who was good enough that he pitched out of their rotation in his last
two injury-free seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But Perez will work once every five days.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan works nearly every day, at least 133 games a year for each
of the last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody talks about me being injury prone," he said. "But
nobody talks about how I play through those injuries."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, 35, works not just on the field, but at his locker, a
former Pro Bowl alternate defensive back who outrageously likens
narcissistic baseball clubhouses to huddles.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at this like I looked at a football--a team sport," he
said. "We've got to rely on each other."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan works the way another Dodger football player once worked.</TE>
<TE>   Same work ethic, same mentality, same giant legs and small
cliches, perhaps you've heard of him.</TE>
<TE>   Guy by the name of Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   He's not going to hit like Sheffield, so forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan will strike out nearly 100 times. He'll barely draw
50 walks. In six full major league seasons, he has batted .300 once.</TE>
<TE>   But just as important is something he probably won't do.</TE>
<TE>   If the Dodgers are three games behind division-leading Arizona on
Sept. 23 and facing the Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium ... Jordan
probably won't walk out.</TE>
<TE>   Not the way Sheffield did last fall, when his silly first-inning
ejection led to the loss not just of one game, but of a season, as
the Dodgers were never that close again.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody around here really knows Jordan that well.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a sense that he is not that sort of player.</TE>
<TE>   He is, instead, the sort of player who keeps his mouth shut in big
games because he loves the fall, with six homers and 26 RBIs in 31
division and league championship series games.</TE>
<TE>   He was dreadful in his only World Series against the New York
Yankees--one for 13--but the Dodgers would be thrilled if he simply
led them there.</TE>
<TE>   He is also the sort of player who has already pumped the bad air
out of that once-nasty corner of the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters no longer sprint there for the latest dirt. Teammates no
longer flee there for fear of being stained by it.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan initially ripped the trade because he had not been warned
and because his wife was on the verge of having a baby.</TE>
<TE>   But now he is all huge grins. And you can almost understand.</TE>
<TE>   "My initial reaction to the trade was shock, thinking about my
family and everything," he said. "But I was fine the next day."</TE>
<TE>   So fine, he rushed into Tracy's office again at the end of spring
training to congratulate him on a fire-and-brimstone speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracy made me want to run through a wall, and I wanted to tell
him that we need more of those speeches," Jordan said. "Before coming
here, I always heard that this team was separated."</TE>
<TE>   It was. In some ways, it still is.</TE>
<TE>   But amid the Dodgers' many dilemmas, there is finally real hope
that this most ancient of problems can be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   The man replacing Gary Sheffield has stalked into an old corner of
the clubhouse carrying a fresh playbook filled with new schemes.</TE>
<TE>   The I-formation not included.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Still Not Himself</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Toronto Blue Jays knocked Pedro Martinez all over Fenway Park,
then still had to come back against Boston's bullpen to win.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez gave up eight runs in the first three innings in Monday's
opener, struggling through one of the worst outings of his career.
But the Blue Jays had to rally to defeat the Red Sox, 12-11, on
Darrin Fletcher's ninth-inning sacrifice fly.</LD>
<LD>   "We hit Pedro," Fletcher said, "but when they came back, we came
back."</LD>
<TE>   Martinez spent the off-season rehabilitating his injured right
shoulder, which limited him to 18 games and a 7-3 record last season
with no victories after May.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time Cy Young winner gained 15 pounds in hopes of
avoiding injury and struggled in spring training. But after throwing
83 pitches, more than expected, he said he felt fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regret anything. I did my best and that's all I can do,"
Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   His control wasn't as sharp as usual, his curveball didn't break
as much and he gave up seven earned runs after giving up only three
in going 3-0 in Boston's last four season openers.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez struck out four, walked two and gave up nine hits before
leaving after putting the first two batters on base in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Delgado reached base in all six plate appearances for
Toronto, going three for three with a walk and twice being hit by
pitches. Eric Hinske drove in three runs for the Blue Jays.</TE>

<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at Marylands' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: Maryland finally won its first championship, although
the game was a surprising toss-up with 10 minutes left. Perhaps
that's why Coach Gary Williams, in his 24th season, looked more
relieved than relaxed when the final horn sounded. Maryland blew a
12-point lead and couldn't shelve the Hoosiers, allowing Indiana to
take its only lead, 44-42, on a layup by Jeffries with 9:53 left. But
Indiana picked the worst possible time to turn frigid, scoring only
eight points the rest of the game, including a meaningless
three-pointer by Donald Perry with one second left. Dixon endured a
scoring drought of almost 20 minutes, but made a three-pointer that
gave Maryland the lead for good. 45-44, with 9:42 left. Maryland made
eight of 10 free throws in the final 2:43. Guard Byron Mouton took
three rebounds, two of them keeping alive Maryland possessions, in
the last three minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Maryland did it the hard way, defeating the
highest possible seed in every round until facing Indiana, the
fifth-seeded team from the South Regional. Indiana failed to become
the only No. 5-seeded team to win a championship.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Dixon, the leading scorer in Maryland history,
had five steals, 18 points on six-of-nine shooting and was the
tournament's most outstanding player. Baxter had a career-high 14
rebounds for Maryland, which held a 42-31 rebounding edge. Maryland
led for all but 11 seconds of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Indiana's three-point shooting finally flamed out
down the stretch, the Hoosiers missing 10 of 11 from behind the arc
after Hornsby's three-pointer with 12:19 left. Indiana did not shoot
a free throw in the second half and made only two free throws in the
game, tying the all-time championship-game low. Jeffries, Newton and
Jarrad Odle made a combined six of 22 shots for Indiana. The loss was
Indiana's first in six championship-game appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Indiana: Hornsby 14, Fife 11. Maryland: Dixon 18,
Baxter 15, Wilcox 10.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Indiana: Jeffries 7. Maryland: Baxter 14,
Wilcox 7.</TE>

<HD>Jeffries Has Few Answers for Underwhelming Play</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Who was the impostor wearing No. 1 for Indiana?</LD>
<LD>   It couldn't possibly have been Jared Jeffries, the gifted go-to
guy, the Big Ten Conference most valuable player and slam-dunk NBA
first-round pick.</LD>
<LD>   Whoever it was, he's No. 2 now.</LD>
<TE>   Whoever it was, his four turnovers, four fouls and anemic
eight-point effort were as much a reason Maryland turned Indiana's
March magic into April fool's gold as anything done by the Terrapins'
Lonny Baxter, Chris Wilcox or Juan Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he wondered what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now all I can feel is that we came up short," Jeffries
said. "A week from now maybe I'll feel different."</TE>
<TE>   A week from now he might declare for the NBA draft, as nearly
everyone expects. Or the skinny 6-foot-10, 215-pound sophomore might
reflect on how he was banged around by Baxter and thumped by Wilcox.
How he was beholden to Tahj Holden, a Terrapin reserve who outweighs
him by 40 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Their inside defense was great," Hoosier guard Tom Coverdale
said. "They didn't need to double-team and could lock out on our
outside shooters."</TE>
<TE>   Another off-season in the Hoosier weight room followed by another
tournament run might be a wise idea for Jeffries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a strong kid in his lower body but maybe one reason he might
want to stay is to strengthen his upper body," junior guard Kyle
Hornsby said. "Personally I want him to stay, he's one of the most
unselfish players in the country and a good guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I want what's best for him and if he thinks it's best for him to
go, that's the way it will be."</TE>
<TE>   If so, this wasn't the exultant exit Jeffries envisioned. He
missed his first shot and made his second, a layup for Indiana's
first points 1:26 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Then ... nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries was tentative, timid and totally lost, missing his only
other three shots in the half, turning the ball over twice, picking
up fouls at the 12:03 and 12:50 marks and spending seven minutes on
the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The second half began similarly. Jeffries turned to shoot in the
key and Baxter grabbed the ball from his hands with the ease of
someone picking an orange from a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Fans yelled, "C'mon J.J," and he briefly came to life along with
the rest of the Hoosiers, scoring on a putback, assisting three-point
baskets by Dane Fife and Hornsby, and scoring twice on inside moves
to improbably put Indiana ahead, 44-42, with 9:52 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But Maryland promptly went on an 11-2 run helped by an off-balance
miss by Jeffries and his foul of Holden, who made two free throws.</TE>
<TE>   With 4:34 to play, Jeffries took his only open jump shot and
didn't draw iron, signifying the end for the Hoosiers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffries was four-of-11 shooting and finished one point shy of
becoming the sixth Indiana sophomore to reach 1,000 career points.
More unfinished business.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomington raised, Jeffries was the national high school player
of the year in 2000 and the Big Ten freshman of the year last season.
He chose to wear No. 1 and reveled in leading the underdog team to
the brink of a national title.</TE>
<TE>   "A person is as big as his legacy," he said. "If you look at all
the great Indiana players, they were on teams that won something."</TE>
<TE>   Did this team win enough for him to say goodbye?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take a bit of time to decide what's best," he said.
"This [loss] is definitely going to weigh into my decision because
it's such an emotional thing.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have won this game and I know I didn't play real well.
I've got a lot to think over."</TE>

<HD>Dixon Deftly Pulls Fast One</HD>
<DH>MVP: As quickly as Indiana comes back, Maryland guard's
three-point shot sparks strong closing run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The momentum, gathering like some fierce and approaching Georgia
thunderstorm since midway through the first half, had finally shifted
toward Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   The Georgia Dome crowd exploded as the underdog Indiana Hoosiers,
who had trailed by 12 points in the game's first 11 minutes, had
ridden an emotional wave of three-point baskets to take their first
lead over Maryland at 44-42 with 9:53 left in Monday night's national
championship game.</LD>
<LD>   It took all of 11 seconds for the Terrapins to stem the tide and
reverse the flow.</LD>
<TE>   That's when Juan Dixon took the heart out of Hoosier Hysteria on
the Terrapins' ensuing possession as he made a three-point shot from
the left wing to regain the lead for Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The senior shooting guard's first basket in more than 20 minutes
gave the Terrapins a lead they would never relinquish in winning
their first national title, 64-52.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, I don't remember seeing the score at that time," said
Dixon, who finished with a game-high 18 points and was named the
Final Four's most outstanding player.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew they had hit a big shot, the fans went wild. But we were
able to break a trap. [Maryland point guard] Steve Blake made a great
pass and I had an open look so I took the shot and we were able to
get the lead back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maryland Coach Gary Williams: "We had to counter right there.
The crowd was starting to get into it from Indiana and we needed
something big to happen. Juan just did what he did all year for us."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana senior guard Dane Fife knew exactly when the Hoosiers'
short-lived advantage in momentum died.</TE>
<TE>   "He swung it back in their direction [with the three-pointer]," he
said. "I was right in his stuff. That's why he's the ACC player of
the year. That's why he's the national champion."</TE>
<TE>   After the teams traded baskets, Dixon then hit a leaning jumper
that ignited a 17-3 Maryland run down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon started fast, scoring 11 of Maryland's first 21 points. But
after his basket at the 10:01 mark of the first half gave the
Terrapins a 21-11 lead, Dixon didn't score again until his clutch
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Fife, known for always defending the other team's top scoring
guard, held Dixon more than nine points below his tournament scoring
average of 27.4 points, but that was of little solace.</TE>
<TE>   "He won," he said. "He has the ability to score at will."</TE>
<TE>   Much had been made about the Fife-Dixon matchup as a key to the
title game, especially after Fife had harassed Oklahoma sharpshooter
Hollis Price into a dreadful one-for-11 shooting performance and
Dixon had scored a career high-tying 33 points in the semifinals
against Kansas on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "He played good defense," Dixon said of Fife. "I wasn't trying to
come out and shoot a lot. I was trying to do other things because I
knew that Indiana was keying on me.... I was trying to let the game
come to me."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon made six of nine from the field, two of four on
three-pointers, and made all four of his free-throw attempts. The
6-foot-3, 164-pounder also had five rebounds, five steals and three
assists in a game-high 38 minutes while committing seven turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I played great help defense today and was able to get
some steals," Dixon said. "I helped my team out in different aspects
of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Especially when it came to shifting the momentum.</TE>

<HD>This Wild Thing Makes Dodgers' Hearts Sink</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was reading stories about Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii this
spring, I couldn't understand how a guy could be so wild as to take
aim at home plate and end up hitting one photographer and nearly
nailing a second.</LD>
<LD>   I knew the Dodgers were concerned, and I had even heard rumors
organist Nancy Bea Hefley was thinking about wearing a helmet every
time Ishii pitches this season in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Then Sunday I was listening to the radio as Ishii walked five
consecutive batters before being yanked, and I thought it was
hopeless until I picked up the paper Monday to find his picture on
page D4: The guy pitches with his eyes closed.</LD>
<TE>   (I believe that's how my daughter picked out the grocery store
bagger).</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, my first inclination after seeing Ishii pitching with his
eyes closed was to call and invite him to The Times to participate in
our United Way drive. The newspaper was giving people a chance to
take aim at selected goofs sitting in a dunk tank, and given Ishii's
inability to throw a strike, at $10 for every three balls tossed, the
United Way would have made a killing.</TE>
<TE>   Then someone said Plaschke would be sitting in the dunk tank, and
all I can tell you is, I wish I was on speaking terms with Kevin
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I STILL wanted to help the Dodgers, so I called the team's
receptionist to let someone know Ishii has been pitching with his
eyes closed and told her I had information that could probably save
the life of a fan sitting down the right-field line.</TE>
<TE>   She hung up on me.</TE>
<TE>   I called back, and although I realized I was fibbing, I told her I
had info that could keep the Dodgers out of last place this season.
She said, "OK," and then hung up on me. I should have known, if GM
Dan Evans has caller I.D., she'd have it too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I went to a phone booth and called for Manager Jim Tracy, and
she said he needed a rest after spring training. I asked for pitching
coach Jim Colborn, and I may be wrong about this, but I think she
said, "He never works."</TE>
<TE>   She put me on hold, and I got a tape recording of Vin Scully
giving me the Dodger highlight of last season: San Francisco's Barry
Bonds hitting his 67th home run off James Baldwin in Dodger Stadium
for a 2-1 Giant victory.</TE>
<TE>   Now I got to thinking about all the wonderful moments in Dodger
history with Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Kirk Gibson, Fernando
Valenzuela, Maury Wills and F.P. Santangelo, and here I was getting
Giants' highlights from a team that made a big deal about not wanting
to celebrate Bonds' home run mark.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, I was hoping no one would come on the line, so I could
hear Jack Clark's mighty rip off Tom Niedenfuer next.</TE>
<TE>   A team spokesman, admittedly as stunned as I was to hear Bonds'
homer getting such prominent play on the Dodger phone line, called
later to say it was no mistake. He said it was part of the team's
40th anniversary CD, which includes both "happy and sad" moments. You
have to do that, I guess, when you run out of happy moments, and
there's a CD to fill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DODGER FANS remember Valenzuela's eyes rolling back into his head,
and Luis Tiant used to turn his back on home plate. I don't recall
anyone ever yelling, "duck!" however, every time they went into the
windup.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that Ishii threw 82 pitches against the Mariners
with his eyes closed, and 33 were for strikes. The bad news is that
Evans told reporters, "I'm not worried about [Ishii] at all," and
this is the pitching expert who brought Baldwin, Mike Trombley and
Terry Mulholland to L.A. last year to improve the opposition's
chances of scoring.</TE>
<TE>   I told Tracy that Ishii was pitching with his eyes closed, and he
said, "I looked beyond the eyes and saw the arm angle in that
picture. It's pretty difficult when you have an arm angle like that
to get the ball over the plate."</TE>
<TE>   So in addition to pitching blind, Ishii has a bum arm angle, a
13.33 spring earned-run average and, as we learned last week, he
can't win if he feels anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   That probably rules out Nancy Bea playing "Wild Thing" every time
he takes the mound, which could end up being the only highlight of
the Dodger season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN THE L.A. Daily News there is an advertisement with Lisa
Leslie's picture promoting the Sparks' WNBA exhibition game against
Phoenix. Directly below that is another ad with this question: "Will
I ever get out of this dead-end job?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ANGELS should have signed Ruben Rivera for their home opener
so he could have at least stolen a run for them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FANS in Atlanta were chanting, "Gary, Gary," after Sheffield
homered in the fifth inning Monday, and then gave him a standing
ovation as he took his place in the field in the sixth. The fans in
Los Angeles did the same thing in last year's opener after his
sixth-inning home run. I had no idea this guy was so popular.*</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE last two months the Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica (2525
Michigan Ave.) has been presenting Viggo Mortensen's "Signlanguage,"
which would probably have been followed by hand gestures from Bobby
Knight had I elected to attend his talk Thursday night and ask

<HD>1 Strike, You're Out on the Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column. E-mail:
arianna @ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an infuriating blow to reason, logic, fairness, compassion and
equal justice, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that people
living in public housing can be evicted for any drug activity by any
household member or guest, even if the drug use happened blocks away
from the housing project and even if the tenant had no inkling that
anything illegal was taking place.</LD>
<LD>   Chew on that for a second. The highest judicial body in the land
has said--unanimously--that it's OK to toss innocent people out of
their houses for crimes they didn't commit and didn't even know
about.</LD>
<LD>   The generals in the drug war are getting mighty desperate--and
silly.</LD>
<TE>   The justices did not merely uphold the constitutionality of the
"one strike and you're out" eviction policy implemented by the
Clinton administration in 1996; they also rushed to its defense,
calling it "reasonable."</TE>
<TE>   Tell that to Herman Walker, a co-defendant in the case, a disabled
79-year-old man who now stands to lose his home because his full-time
health-care worker was found with drug paraphernalia in the
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Or to Pearlie Rucker, the named defendant, a 63-year-old
great-grandmother who found herself facing eviction when her mentally
disabled daughter was caught possessing cocaine three blocks away
from Rucker's apartment (officials later revoked Rucker's eviction
after she kicked her daughter out of her home).</TE>
<TE>   The high court's opinion, written by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, tried to buttress its cold-hearted argument by claiming
that so-called "no-fault" evictions are justified because drug use
leads to "murders, muggings and other forms of violence."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, two of the four plaintiffs in the case before the
court were elderly women whose grandchildren were caught smoking
marijuana in a housing project parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is a gut-wrenching reminder of just how differently
America treats its rich and its poor. The multimillion-dollar homes
of Beverly Hills or the Upper East Side of Manhattan have their fair
share of kids struggling with drug problems.</TE>
<TE>   But as concerned as these kids' parents are, you can bet that
their problems are not compounded by the additional worry that the
entire family will be tossed out onto the street because their kid is
smoking a joint three blocks away. Why should we hold poor people to
a standard many of us could never meet?</TE>
<TE>   "A tenant who cannot control drug crime," wrote Rehnquist, "is a
threat to other residents and the project."</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the chief justice would apply the same condemnatory
logic to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who also lives in public housing and
apparently was unable to control his troubled daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, our political establishment, whether ensconced in
governors' mansions or not, is filled with people unable to "control
drug crime" by a household member.</TE>
<TE>   But the politicians--including Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.),
Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Reps. Dan
Burton (R-Ind.), Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), John Murtha (D-Pa.), Randy
"Duke" Cunningham (R-San Diego) and Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.)--weren't
punished for the sins of their kids.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, unlike the thousands of mostly poor and minority drug
offenders who have had the book thrown at them, these lawmakers'
offspring were frequently granted special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that poor kids are routinely sent to jail
while rich kids are given a slap on the wrist and a ticket to rehab,
or that poor parents are thrown out of their houses for not knowing
what their kids are doing while powerful parents are given our
sympathy and understanding.</TE>
<TE>   But it is unjust.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a thought: Why don't Kennedy and Burton call a joint
Senate-House hearing on "one strike and you're out" no-fault
evictions.</TE>
<TE>   They can call Jeb Bush, Pearlie Rucker and their respective
daughters (one who was taken to rehab, one who was taken to jail) as
the first witnesses.</TE>

<HD>'We Must Vanquish an Enemy Determined to Annihilate Us'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU</AU>
<BD>Benjamin Netanyahu is a former prime minister of
Israel.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM--The message Palestinian terrorists are sending us is
crystal clear: We will murder you at every opportunity, in every
place, at any time--even on the holiest of your days.</LD>
<LD>   An unremitting carnage that indiscriminately slaughters all who
come within the murderous reach of Palestinian terrorists shows the
depths of their hatred.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly, the only constraint on Arab terrorists is their
capability to destroy. Given the power, they would kill all of us,
down to the last infant. The primary objective of Yasser Arafat's
terrorist regime is not to establish the 22nd Arab state but to
destroy the only Jewish state. This was and remains at the heart of
the conflict.</LD>
<TE>   In 1948, the Arabs rejected an international resolution that would
have established a Palestinian state and instead attempted to destroy
an embryonic Jewish state. Fifty-two years later, Arafat rejected a
similar offer and demanded the flooding of Israel with millions of
Palestinians, a measure that would effectively bring about the
destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   With such a regime, whose ultimate objective is our destruction
and which pursues this objective by the most barbaric means
imaginable, there is no place for negotiations and no hope of
reaching any sustainable peace agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the much-vaunted political solution to end the conflict
was attempted two years ago at Camp David, and it utterly failed.
Arafat rejected a scandalously far-reaching Israeli offer of a
sovereign Palestinian state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip,
which included half of Jerusalem, and instead chose to unleash the
present war of terror against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one option now available to Israel: to decisively
win the war that has been forced upon us.</TE>
<TE>   What is required of us today is not a willingness to clench our
teeth and bear this ongoing violence. We must instead seek a total
military victory against an implacable enemy. First, we must
immediately dismantle the Palestinian Authority and expel Arafat.
Second, we must encircle the main Palestinian population centers,
purge them of terrorists and eradicate the terrorist infrastructure.
Third, we must establish security separation lines that will allow
Israeli armed forces to enter Palestinian territory but prevent
Palestinian terrorists from entering our towns and cities.</TE>
<TE>   The choice we face today is not between military victory and a
security separation. Rather, we must do both together. Only by
combining the two can we stop the terror, restore a deterrent that
has been dangerously eroded in the last two years, and enable a
realistic and moderate leadership to emerge among the Palestinians
with which we can pursue a political settlement in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Like a partial dose of antibiotics that is not sufficient to cure
the disease, the partial actions of the government and the fitful
changes between a policy of restraint and halfhearted military action
have not and will not achieve anything. Our excessive concern about
the international community has also borne bitter fruit. Israel's
refusal so far to act as would any other self-respecting nation
heightens the doubts in the minds of our friends about our belief in
the justice of our cause and encourages our enemies to increase the
bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to win international understanding for our position,
especially in the United States, is to steadfastly assert our basic
right to defend ourselves and to achieve a quick and decisive
military victory that will stop the terrible massacre of our
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the claim that we have tried all military means to end
the terror is baseless. We have not even used a fraction of our
military power, and the little we have used has not been directed
toward the right purpose, namely ending Arafat's regime. Today, after
18 months of terrorism, the government continues to work under the
illusion that it is possible to stop terrorism without dismantling
this main terrorist engine.</TE>
<TE>   What is absolutely clear is that we cannot continue, even for one
more day, on a path of indecision without a goal or a policy.</TE>
<TE>   We must do what any nation in our position would do: stop
bickering among ourselves, fight the war that has been forced upon us
and vanquish an enemy who is determined to annihilate us.</TE>

<HD>Abortion Isn't Just a Federal Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY L. SASAKI</AU>
<BD>Nancy L. Sasaki is president and CEO of Planned
Parenthood Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the gubernatorial primary, some Californians seemed astonished
that Gov. Gray Davis raised a woman's right to choose safe, legal
abortion as a campaign issue. Clearly, some California voters believe
this is a federal matter and are not aware of the effect a state
governor can have on a woman's right to choose.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis was correct to focus on the issue, and he must continue
to do so during his general election campaign against Bill Simon, who
is staunchly anti-choice.</LD>
<LD>   Californians live in a state that sets the standard for protecting
a woman's right to family planning. Californians are overwhelmingly
pro-choice. Where a candidate for state office stands on this issue
can be a deal breaker.</LD>
<TE>   While many people are familiar with the role of the U.S. Supreme
Court in protecting choice, they may not be aware of just what kind
of threats to reproductive freedom can--and do--exist at the state
level.</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of anti-choice measures introduced in states
during the past six years, a woman's reproductive rights today are
more restricted than they were in 1973, when the Supreme Court handed
down its Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 alone, 45 new anti-choice measures were adopted at the
state level.</TE>
<TE>   How can this be, given that Roe vs. Wade made a woman's right to
abortion "the law of the land"? For starters, an increasingly
conservative U.S. Supreme Court has given states great leeway in
restricting abortion.</TE>
<TE>   In its 1989 decision in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
a majority of the court failed to reaffirm Roe vs. Wade's "strict
scrutiny" standard for reviewing abortion restrictions, meaning more
restrictions could be passed into law. Many states set out to test
what types of antiabortion restrictions the court would uphold.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in 14 states, a woman may have to travel many miles to reach
an abortion provider and then must wait 24 to 48 hours after seeing
the doctor to actually have the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   At least 25 states, plus the District of Columbia, limit public
funding for abortion only to cases of life endangerment, rape and
incest. In 2000, a total of 21 governors signed anti-choice
legislation into state law.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, if Roe vs. Wade were overturned, 11 states
probably would pass a ban on abortion in all or most circumstances.
With the U.S. Supreme Court one vote away from overturning Roe, the
danger of this happening is real.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, states can wield tremendous power over a woman's right to
choose. In a striking example of this power, Davis, a Democrat,
recently declared his support for state Senate Bill 1301. Among other
things, the bill would codify Roe vs. Wade in the state, protecting
California women's right to choose regardless of what happens to Roe
vs. Wade at the national level.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, GOP candidate Simon has declared his opposition to
abortion and has stated that he does not want to discuss it during
this last leg of the California gubernatorial campaign. Instead, he
seeks to woo moderate GOP women back to the fold by focusing on
education.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, Simon would be able to appoint anti-choice judges to
our state's Supreme Court and to other state court positions, which
would be problematic if Roe is overturned. And with veto and budget
power, Simon would be able to put up dangerous roadblocks to a right
that women in California have had for so long.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the media and the people of California must hold Simon's
feet to the fire on the issue of choice. And everyone should
understand exactly why it is so critical to do so.</TE>

<LD>There is enough blame to go around for the events that have turned
the Camp David promise of peace into the killing fields of the
Mideast without dragging in President Bush. To ignore the arrogant
failure of this administration, however, is to deny the obvious: From
its first day in power, it showed no interest in securing peace
between Israel and the Palestinians, quickly squandering years of
difficult progress made under President Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with outright war already a reality, Bush is tacitly
endorsing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's eye-for-an-eye
descent into madness because it is a response to Palestinian
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the kudos the media have heaped on our wartime president,
it was only after Sept. 11 that Bush grasped that terrorism is an
international reality that deeply affects the United States'
security. Even then, he has sought to pound the problem away in the
mountains of Afghanistan and through saber-rattling against an
alleged "axis of evil," ignoring its source in the intractable
politics and passions of the Arab-Israeli wars.</LD>
<TE>   For the U.S. to have pretended, even for a year, that these wars
are a regional problem was ludicrous. We have dominated Mideast
politics for decades, intervening overtly and covertly, subsidizing
whole economies, pouring in armaments like gasoline onto a fire. In
the end it was the responsibility of an incoming U.S. president to
continue the commitment of his predecessor to the peace process,
rather than striking a pose of total indifference.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Arafat had possessed the courage to grasp the
considerable concessions of Sharon's predecessor, peace--and not this
nightmare--might well be at hand. And if the Israeli electorate had
rejected the candidacy of the man responsible for Israel's failed
invasion of Lebanon and brutal massacre of Palestinian refugees,
prospects for compromise would at least still exist.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it is the people who endure the immediate suffering on
both sides who will have to find an alternative to agonizing death of
biblical proportions.</TE>
<TE>   However, the history of their conflict is so twisted and the
passions so deranged that peace cannot come without outside
intervention, primarily from the U.S. That was the principle accepted
at the beginning of the peace process in Oslo, the principle
underscored by the Camp David accords and the principle revived in
the recent Saudi peace proposal just endorsed by representatives of
the entire Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he embraced the Saudi proposal but then just as quickly
gave Sharon the green light to jettison it because Palestinians are
practicing terrorism against Israeli civilians. While it plays well
on television, abhorrence of terrorism does not and cannot define the
range of culpability and possibility in the region. Terror is a
tactic used by those who do not possess planes and tanks and trained
infantry. Yet Bush, in his statements, is fixated on the notion that
the use of terror is the only issue in the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   It is not, of course. The crux, as any eighth-grader should know,
is that two peoples claim the same land. And if they cannot find a
sturdy compromise, the outward ripples from their rage and hate
darkly threaten the rest of us, as was so painfully discovered in
September.</TE>
<TE>   There is no military solution in the offing, nor has there ever
been. I clearly remember Israel's optimism 35 years ago after its
resounding victory in a six-day war, as expressed in my interview
with Moshe Dayan.</TE>
<TE>   A warrior-hero, Dayan spoke earnestly of bringing indoor plumbing
and clean water supplies to the horrid Palestinian refugee camps
neglected by the Egyptians in Gaza, as if that would be enough to
usher in a new era of peace. It wasn't; Israel has tried at times to
be a model occupier, but no people in modern times will ever for long
submit to the indignity of occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian statehood, as called for in the Saudi plan and
tentatively endorsed by the Bush administration, is the only way
forward. The Jewish settlements must be ended, and the U.S., the
Europeans and the Arab nations must commit to Israel's secure
borders, as they existed before the Six-Day War.</TE>
<TE>   The forging of such a peace is the only anti-terrorism campaign
that has a serious chance of success.</TE>

<HD>Washington's Burden ...</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush took office a year ago determined that his
administration not resemble Bill Clinton's either in style (more
suits, less denim) or substance (hands off the Middle East). Now
reality intervenes. Now "hands off" by the only outside power able to
mediate the Mideast crisis looks like myopic timidity. Now,
belatedly, the administration needs to dive in and separate the
Israelis and Palestinians--and with fear and rage pounding through
both combatants' veins, it's going to take a higher-ranking referee
than Anthony C. Zinni to make that happen.</LD>
<LD>   Washington dispatched Zinni to Israel twice in recent months to
try for a cease-fire but called him home when the violence worsened.
Then Vice President Dick Cheney gave diplomacy a try. But Cheney's
mission to Arab countries and Israel was more about clearing a path
for future action against Iraq than about Middle East peace for its
own sake.</LD>
<LD>   We hope that the ghastly conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians has finally made Bush realize that the crisis merits his
administration's focused attention regardless of what happens with
Iraq. We hope he also sees the futility of the current process,
wherein Zinni, back for a third time, is trying to get both sides to
agree to a cease-fire while putting off a return to the underlying
political debate.</LD>
<TE>   It's time to send in Secretary of State Colin L. Powell with a
plan recognizing that military and political talks can and must go on
at the same time. But even Powell won't be effective until Bush
articulates a clear and consistent position. On Saturday the United
States joined in the 14-0 vote in the U.N. Security Council that
demanded "the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian cities,
including Ramallah," headquarters of Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat. But when Bush faced TV cameras that day he repeated
the mantra that Arafat could do more--with no mention of an Israeli
withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Though new U.S. presidents may wish it so, there's no way for this
nation to extricate itself from the Middle East. Even before Henry A.
Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war,
secretaries of State realized that the volatile region was vitally
important to American interests. Cyrus Vance, George Shultz, James
Baker and Warren Christopher came to know Israel and the surrounding
countries well. Washington administrations did not always get along
with the Israeli government in power. But each, while wary of the
seemingly eternal quagmire's complexity, also recognized the high
stakes and the need to be an honest broker.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton plunged in personally and came close to bringing
Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to an accord. Yes,
Arafat burned Clinton at the last minute by rejecting a reasonable
plan. But surely Bush understands that geopolitics is a brutal game;
leaders have to play with whoever's on the field, and at the moment
that means Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Powell and Bush both have spoken about the ultimate objective of
political negotiations: the state of Israel and a Palestinian state,
both behind secure and defensible borders. Getting there will be
tortuous. But what's happening now is increasingly tragic. Until the
world's sole remaining superpower assertively intervenes, the already
ugly fight will continue escalating toward something even more
gruesome.</TE>

<LD>The United States can help bring peace to the Middle East. But only
if the two key players there shake off their blood lust, get past
their 20 years of personal antipathy and recognize that neither can
win the mutually destructive war in which they're now engaged.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli tank assaults and the arrests of Palestinians have not
stopped suicide bombers. Suicide bombers have not stopped the
fusillades from Israeli tanks. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
vague pronouncements about "isolating" Yasser Arafat and "rooting out
terrorism" do not constitute a strategy. And Arafat's professed
embrace of martyrdom while watching the young bombers die and kill is
even less of a plan.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat won't be able to stop every suicide bomber, but a tough
statement in Arabic to all Palestinians to put down their weapons
could give pause to some young fanatic presently strapping explosives
around his chest. The Palestinian leader should speak out now.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israel is calling up 20,000 military reservists, the
largest such action since 1982 when Sharon, then an army general, led
the invasion of Lebanon. It's hard to argue against a strong
defensive posture by a nation that day by day has seen bombers
butcher its men, women and children. But Israel's neighbors shudder
at what looks like preparation for violent oppression of a people,
few of whom have taken to bombing even though they have spent their
lives watching the promise of an independent state continually
deferred to some indefinite future.</TE>
<TE>   Some bombers want the cycle of violence to continue. When peace
talks appear about to bear fruit, they attack. But here's the tragic
conundrum that Sharon seems unable to recognize: Despite Israel's
aggressive response to the slaughter, including attacks on Arafat's
Ramallah compound, Palestinian terrorists continue to kill civilians
daily. Calling off talks because of suicide bombings gives the
terrorists a veto over peace.</TE>
<TE>   The mayhem has turned moderates in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza
into extremists. Arafat hears the shouts of those who want Israel
obliterated. Sharon is pressed by Israelis, including political rival
Benjamin Netanyahu, who want tougher action against the Palestinians.
Sharon and Arafat need to ignore these voices, which have echoed for
generations. Enormously difficult though it may be, they need to give
up their pasts and the short-term appeal of retribution and start
leading their people toward peace.</TE>

<HD>Reopening Opening Day</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's the deal anyway with different opening days for a baseball
season already underway? On Sunday the Angels and Indians played an
official game (well, at least the Indians played). That was the real
opening day for the nation's 2002 baseball season. Ask the Easter
Sunday sellout crowd of 42,697 in Anaheim. No Mo Vaughn, but they all
saw the opening day game--6-zip for Cleveland. So there's no doubt
that 2002 baseball got underway on the weekend. But judging by all
the hoo-hah sports coverage last night and this morning, Monday was
"Opening Day" in many places. The nerve!</LD>
<LD>   Time was opening day was, well, opening day. The season was open
or it wasn't. Like pregnancy, you were or you weren't; no maybe for
either. The concept of opening day is ingenious and downright grand,
regardless of the ensuing shoe-tapping, bat-rubbing, endless
warming-up tedium. Opening day was made for optimists, even Cub fans.
The slate was clean for everyone. Baseball's winter trades and spring
training were over; so, finally, was basketball.</LD>
<LD>   At the stadium, the new basepaths were perfectly etched in reddish
dirt, the seats unmarked by pigeons. Opening day augured a full
summer of sun unfolding dawn after dawn. Opening day was packed with
warmth and fresh potential.</LD>
<TE>   Opening day also meant that closing day for school was close by.
Hooky on opening day was excused by a nice note to the teacher. Like
the newly cut grass laid out so very green and fresh for everyone,
opening day at the stadium always smelled good, even before the hot
dog steam wafted through the newly painted seats. There, countless
youngsters wore their well-pounded gloves, newly liberated from the
closet, oiled and ready to snag any fortuitous foul that flew by.
Opening day was more full of anticipation than a sweet-smelling
unopened pack of bubble gum trading cards. What either could contain
was limited only by imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Football and hockey had opening days too, but they weren't the
same. The closest thing to the excitement of baseball opening day was
in September when car dealers tore down the paper temporarily
covering showroom windows to reveal the metallic splendor of next
year's models. That was an impressive array of movable chrome to
behold. But as living proof of an enduring social normalcy, the
rhythmic beginning of a new season of excitement and progress,
baseball's opening day was the perfect seasonal marker.</TE>
<TE>   As such, come to think of it, after this past autumn of awe and a
winter of war, maybe it's not such a bad thing this April to have
more than one opening day--just for emphasis.</TE>

<LD>The Columbia Pictures thriller "Panic Room" grossed $30.1 million,
the best debut of any film over an Easter weekend. Second place went
to the 20th Century Fox animated hit "Ice Age," which took in $18.1
million.</LD>

$16 million for a third-place finish, but Paramount Pictures'
kid-oriented sci-fi adventure "Clockstoppers" ($10.1 million) and
Warner Bros.' dark satire "Death to Smoochy" ($4.3 million) fared
less well.</LD>

<LD>Patrick Moore's March 26 commentary, "Greens Don't See Forest for the
Trees," was of great interest to us; however, he misrepresents the
origin and role of the Forest Stewardship Council. Moore portrays the
FSC as a tool created by North American environmental activists to
impose their agendas on the corporate world. Not only was Greenpeace
at the table when the FSC was founded but so was a balance of other
environmental, social and business interests, including World
Wildlife Fund, Ikea and the Home Depot.</LD>
<LD>   The FSC does not, as Moore says, "make the rules and hand out the
certificates." Under the FSC system, forest management standards are
developed in open, democratic and transparent processes by
independent groups of stakeholders representing a broad range of
interests. They are ultimately reviewed by scientists to ensure that
they represent leading-edge thinking on the management of forests.</LD>
<LD>   The FSC is international in scope, with a balanced membership
representing interests from 60 countries--and nearly 70 million acres
of forests certified through its system in 47 countries on five
continents.</LD>

<TE>   Moore fails to make any distinction between timber monocrops,
grown for harvest, and native forests in his claim that "there is
about the same amount of forest cover today as there was 100 years
ago." Native forests are biologically diverse, self-sustaining
ecosystems that host countless species, create new soil, prevent
erosion and do not require human intervention. Timber monocrops are
to a real forest what a fast-food hamburger is to Sunday supper
prepared by a grandma--a pale imitation of the real thing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Welfare Plan Would Count Family Time," March 28: The Bush
administration welfare plan, which has declared the "well-being of
children" a primary concern, would allow low-income parents to
receive credit for part of their work by participating with their
children in organized activities. This sounds compassionate; in
reality, it is shortsighted and doomed to failure.</LD>
<LD>   A parent who has come off welfare, in all probability, has a
minimum-wage job without medical benefits. Many single parents
working at minimum wage need two jobs to barely break even. This does
not allow time to participate with their children in other activities
even if they are given credit for the hours. Credit for time worked
is not pay for time worked. Minimum wage does not cover necessities
and certainly won't stretch to meet the costs of organized
activities.</LD>

<LD>According to your March 28 headline, "Most Teens Admit Risky Road
Behavior." "They think they are 10 feet tall and bulletproof," says
Tina Pasco of MADD.</LD>
<LD>   So, then, must adults. I am a frequent pedestrian and have nearly
been run over by any number of hostile, unskilled and oblivious
drivers. The vast majority are grown-ups; no teenager has ever
shouted profanity at me for crossing the street too slowly, for
instance. It is ludicrous to assume that risky driving is a "teen
problem." Rude and dangerous driving is the rule, as opposed to the
exception, on our roads. We all need to open our eyes and realize
that dangerous driving is everyone's problem.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Is Reversed in Parole Dispute," March 31, and "Davis Gets
More Money From Prison Guards," March 30: Could anyone be more off
base than Gov. Gray Davis? A man with terminal illness declared by
the presiding judge to be the least culpable in a killing is a threat
to society, parole denied?</LD>
<LD>   Just what is wrong with this governor? Does part of his sellout to
the correctional officers' union include stocking the prisons so that
they can get 34% raises and he can get hundreds of thousands of
dollars in political payoffs? What a deal. Then he fulfills a promise
to the union to close private prisons to save "the taxpayer" money,
except the budget pros say it won't. The decision does, however,
increase the union staff in state prisons so the governor can get
more than the measly $251,000 he just got from this union (oh yes,
three weeks after he signed the raises).</LD>

<TE>   I have been a Democrat my entire life and have never been as
embarrassed (even including Bill Clinton's indiscretions and pardons)
as I have been by our governor's parole policy. How sinful! To make
sure that a Willie Horton does not haunt him in his majestic quest
for higher office, Davis has decided to totally ignore a parole board
that has recommended that only 1% of the murderers before it be
released. I pity you, dear governor, when the true judgment day comes
around.</TE>

<TE>   In what state can a large contribution to a gubernatorial
candidate get your group a large pay raise when he becomes governor
and then get the new governor another large contribution from the
group? Hint: Its motto is "Eureka."</TE>

<TE>   Davis should be the poster child for campaign finance reform. He
has been an utter failure the last four years, and I blame money. He
knows that to win reelection he has to spend night and day dialing
for dollars.</TE>
<TE>   He had all the makings of a good governor: liberal background,
government know-how and a landslide of support in his election. His
campaign promised all the right things. But he has failed every
promise, from education to the economy. It's not that he couldn't
succeed, but he hasn't been able to concentrate. He has been too
distracted with fund-raising. But who can blame him? It's the corrupt
system we live in.</TE>

<TE>   Blame me, I voted for Davis. I'm not sure what I saw in him. I
guess I thought he would be Clinton without the scandals. But
instead, Davis has failed us every chance he had. As hard as I try, I
can't think of one good thing Davis has done for the state. Throw him
out.</TE>

<HD>Burmese Must Unite Against Dictatorship</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I admire Anna Husarska for her straightforward, practical and very
constructive analysis on Burma ("It's Not Easy to Bring Down a
Dictator," Commentary, March 28). Four decades have passed, with tens
of thousands of people killed, jailed and displaced, and Burma's
dictatorship is still as strong and alive as ever. Husarska's
analysis on the insufficient unity and focus of the democratic forces
in and out of Burma is an accurate assessment.</LD>
<LD>   Burma lacks unified opposition to the regime outside of the
country. People inside cannot move, more than what they have done
bravely so far. The duty is now with people outside Burma, especially
exiled Burmese. We must understand that we have a common enemy, the
dictatorship. We must be able to set aside the differences among
ourselves in order to establish a united front. Unity will bring
victory. I am sure that the democratic governments want to see the
Burmese people unite in the quest for democracy and the leadership of
Aung San Suu Kyi.</LD>

<LD>Re "Catholics Take Comfort in Easter," April 1: With all the scandal
surrounding the Roman Catholic Church, I expected that disillusioned
Catholics would stay away from Easter Sunday Mass. Instead, on Easter
morning I found our church literally packed to the rafters. Friends
and family reported the same phenomenon at their parishes. It seems
to prove what we've really known all along--our faith is not in
fallible priests or their fallible hierarchy.</LD>

<HD>Arafat Should Be Removed From Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I believe the time has come for the U.S. to endorse the Israeli
military action against Yasser Arafat and his Fatah movement for
their heinous crimes against innocent civilians and nonmilitary
targets. I also believe that military action against the Palestinians
should lead to the removal of Arafat as leader of the Palestinians.
Twenty people were killed in Netanya during the Passover massacre.
Since the intifada started, approximately 400 Israelis have been
killed. This would translate into 22,400 Americans being killed if it
happened here. We would not put up with this, so why should we expect
Israel to?</LD>
<LD>   Israel and Jews all over the world want peace. This peace is not
possible as long as a murderer and terrorist like Arafat is in power.
Arafat must be removed in order for the peace process to move forward
and the violence to end.</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Hoffman</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It takes great statesmen to change history. Both Ariel Sharon and
Arafat failed the test of history, and it is time for both of them to
go. It is Sharon's policy and actions that led to the suffering of
both the Israelis and the Palestinians. In contrast, Arafat's lack of
policy direction and actions led to the suffering of his people and
their overwhelming feelings of desperation. We can say Arafat is
being stripped of his power by Sharon's actions, but Arafat was not
bold enough to turn the tables in his own favor.</TE>
<TE>   To both, Sharon and Arafat: Remember that God almighty is powerful
and in control.</TE>
<TE>   Khaled Soliman</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Arafat is honest about restraining suicide bomber terrorists,
instead of their being rewarded, he will declare the act a crime.
Further, he should arrest the bomber's entire family--mother, father,
sisters, brothers--as conspirators. This will surely deter bombers
and enable Arafat to demonstrate his seriousness about fostering
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Bert Eifer</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Sharon's policies make perfect sense. Because isolating
Arafat is going to make everything better. No one is going to get
angry; they're just going to give in once their leader is held
hostage and martyred. Just give in to Israel's demands, even though
Israel is illegally occupying Palestinian land, illegally building
and supporting settlements. Basically, Sharon is a warlord, a
criminal. If anything, his actions will only spark more bitter hatred
for him and his administration. He is risking the lives of millions
of innocents, as well as the stability of the world to settle a
personal score he has with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon's idea of extending his hand in peace is surrounding his
counterpart's headquarters, occupying his cities and towns,
demolishing civilian homes, razing acres of olive trees, killing
women and children, rounding up all the Palestinians he can and
imprinting individual numbers on them, then all I can say is that he
is doing Hitler proud. Ironic, isn't it!</TE>
<TE>   Wasim Muklashy</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As one who supported the Palestinian position in the present
conflict, I must now admit that I was wrong. It is absolutely
impossible to justify in any way the disgusting act of murder
committed by the Palestinians this Passover. I now feel that Israel
must by any means necessary end the threat posed by Palestinian
terrorists.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Power of Restraint," editorial, March 29: It's easy to
call for restraint from 7,500 miles away, when it's not your family
members that were killed for no other reason than because they were
eating dinner in the wrong hotel. The U.S. didn't exercise all that
much restraint in responding to the terrorists who brutally damaged
our nation. Neither should Israel restrain itself, after hundreds of
senseless murders and dozens of attacks. Any other response
legitimizes the terrorist murder of civilians as a negotiation
device.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenage girls crossing the street in front of Hollywood High
School were wounded Monday when a fight outside a fast-food
restaurant escalated into gunfire.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified girls were each shot in the leg and treated at a
hospital for wounds not considered life threatening, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The gunfire erupted at 3:30 p.m. as students were leaving school
for the day, and some at first thought it was an April Fool's prank.</LD>
<TE>   "But I knew it was real when I saw the blood," said Neil
Humphreys, a ninth-grader at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found five bullet shells in front of a Carl's Jr.
restaurant at the scene. Teenagers who were in front of the
restaurant at the time said the shooting occurred after a fight broke
out in a driveway next to the hamburger stand.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy with the gun was shooting into the alley and then he
turned to run and the gun kept going off," a 10th-grader said. "He
was shooting crazy. Both the girls were crossing the street when they
were shot."</TE>
<TE>   Officers closed the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Highland
Avenue, snarling afternoon traffic through Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Police said a lone gunman ran from the corner. Other witnesses
told investigators that he jumped into a black or gray Volvo and
drove off.</TE>

<HD>A. Bin Laden, 75; Uncle of Terrorist</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>Abdullah Awad bin Laden, patriarch of one of the wealthiest families
in Saudi Arabia and uncle of terrorist Osama bin Laden, has died. He
was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah bin Laden died in Medina on March 21 and was buried that
day in the holy city in western Saudi Arabia in accordance with
Islamic tradition, according to a death notice published in the
London-based newspaper Asharq al-Awsat.</LD>
<LD>   No cause of death was given, although Abdullah bin Laden had high
blood pressure and diabetes.</LD>
<TE>   Though he was head of the family, in the last decade Abdullah bin
Laden had had little to do with the day-to-day running of the family
business, the Saudi bin Laden Group.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's father and Abdullah bin Laden's younger brother,
Mohammed bin Laden, started the enterprise as a construction firm in
the 1930s. The business, which grew to include mining and
telecommunications and had $3 billion to $5 billion in annual

54 sons.</TE>
<TE>   The bin Laden family disavowed any links with Osama bin Laden in
1994, the year Saudi Arabia stripped him of his citizenship for his
opposition activities.</TE>
<TE>   As head of his family, it was Abdullah bin Laden who issued a
statement offering condolences to those who lost loved ones in the
Sept. 11 attacks blamed on Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The statement also offered "strong condemnation of this tragic
incident of which many men, women and children were victims and which
contradicts the teachings of our religion, Islam."</TE>

<HD>Peter Biehl, 59; Forgave Killers of Daughter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Biehl, who along with his wife channeled the pain of their
daughter Amy's murder by a mob in South Africa into a passion for
alleviating poverty and violence there, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   Biehl, of La Quinta, died Sunday at Eisenhower Medical Center in
Rancho Mirage of complications from colon cancer, which was recently
diagnosed.</LD>
<LD>   "He was an action man. He wanted to understand the problems of
South Africa and do something to solve those problems," said Linda
Biehl, his childhood sweetheart and wife of 38 years. "It brought out
his strengths and compassion. It brought out who he truly is."</LD>
<TE>   In 1993, their 26-year-old daughter--a Fulbright scholar who
worked with disadvantaged South Africans--was stoned and stabbed as a
crowd shouted anti-white slogans. Four black men were convicted in
her death.</TE>
<TE>   The Biehls supported the killers' amnesty as South Africa moved
from bloody unrest to a post-apartheid government. Then they hired
two of the men to work for the Amy Biehl Foundation Trust, which
since 1997 has given $5 million to a variety of social programs and
business projects in and around Cape Town.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a mentor to these two young men," Linda Biehl, 58, said of
her husband's forgiveness. "And they loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu said in a prepared
statement: "What was so remarkable was not only that they forgave the
killers of their daughter, but that they went so far as to
rehabilitate them."</TE>
<TE>   'A Profound Loss to South Africa'</TE>
<TE>   Compassionate and with many ideas for new ventures, Peter and
Linda Biehl worked as a team, taking on the steep learning curve of
the international aid business one step at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an incredibly rare person," said Sharon Gelman, executive
director of the Los Angeles-based Artists for a New South Africa,
which works closely with the Amy Biehl Foundation. "He was amazingly
smart, and the way he dealt with the loss of his daughter set an
example.... He was a wonderful, warm, embracing, giving, intelligent,
incredibly committed human being, and I adored him. His passing is a
profound loss to South Africa."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has funded job-training and after-school programs,
which provide food, tutors, arts instruction and recreation--all to
prevent youth violence. It has provided scholarships for South
African students to study in the United States, started health
programs that provide HIV and AIDS counseling, and launched a
first-aid training effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost a great leader and visionary," said Ashleigh Murphy,
project manager for the Amy Biehl Foundation in Cape Town. "He had an
amazing belief in the progress of South Africa. He taught this
country about forgiveness and reconciliation. He was also helping to
teach the stories of South Africa to the rest of the world--and his
story was one of those stories."</TE>
<TE>   Biehl taught by example, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a great sense of humor and warmth," Murphy said, "and when
you were with him you always felt comfortable and open, no matter who
you were. He was always thinking of the next step, but I have no
doubt that the work of the foundation will continue."</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Murphy, the foundation's former manager who is now studying
international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge loss," he said. "He was a mentor to me and a lot of
other young people looking to enter the world of international
development. He was also a close personal friend who introduced me to
my wife and linked me forever to the struggles of South Africa....
[His death leaves] a huge void in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Biehl, who left his marketing career to devote his time to
South Africa, wanted the foundation to do more than just throw money
at the poor, his wife said. He wanted to provide services that South
Africans said they wanted, create jobs and find ways that the
foundation could sustain itself by generating income.</TE>
<TE>   "He used his business skills and applied them to our social
agenda," Linda Biehl said. "He wanted to help, not in a patronizing,
do-gooder kind of way, but in a developmental way."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, which employs 87 people, built a golf driving
range outside Cape Town to provide youth recreation and jobs. A chain
of bakeries produces "Amy's Bread--The Bread of Hope and Peace."
Besides jobs and cash, the bakeries provide a message with each sale:
The bags have HIV and AIDS prevention information printed on them.</TE>
<TE>   In the communities where the foundation carries out its work,
Peter and Linda Biehl are known as tamkhulu and makhulu: grandfather
and grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "He was interested in doing anything for the African people. To
see that passion in his eyes was extraordinary," said Ashlie Gravley,
26, one of numerous young interns the Biehls have sent to South
Africa to work on foundation projects. "They still go through a lot
of pain over Amy's death, but I think this helps them cure it a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew that this is what Amy would have wanted."</TE>
<TE>   The Biehls Met in Sunday School</TE>
<TE>   Peter Biehl was born in Chicago in 1943. He and Linda met at age 9
in Sunday school and began dating when they were 16. They moved west
together, graduating from Whittier College. They were married between
their junior and senior years. He is survived by three children and
three grandchildren. Services are pending.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was awesome," said daughter, Kim Biehl, 36, of San
Clemente. "He is the most selfless person I've ever known. He put
everybody before him."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, as the foundation grew, the Biehls spent most of
their time in South Africa. It was there, in mid-February, that Peter
Biehl began having stomach cramps. He thought he had picked up a
local bug. But when he returned to the United States, his health
worsened, and by early March, his kidneys, then his liver, stopped
functioning.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Biehl recalled that after Amy's death, her father wrote his
slain daughter a letter on the flight back from South Africa. In it,
he promised to carry on her work. From that, the Amy Biehl Foundation
was born.</TE>
<TE>   "Peter and I talked about it when he was still able to talk,"
Linda Biehl said. "He said, 'You go for it. Keep this thing we
started going.' I told him, 'I will. And you'll be there with me.'"</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be made to the Amy Biehl Foundation, c/o
Steve Schwarz, 29 Independence Drive, Hillsborough, NJ 08844.</TE>

<HD>School Bus Strike Possible, District Warns</HD>
<DH>Labor: Union says it has no immediate walkout plans, but
L.A. school officials say 20,000 pupils could be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District warned Monday of a possible
school bus drivers' strike this week, which could delay service and
disrupt schedules for as many as 20,000 students.</LD>
<LD>   The Teamsters Union and Laidlaw Education Services, the district's
main bus contractor, have been negotiating salary and benefit issues
since August. After they reached an impasse in February, federal
mediators stepped in but have failed to resolve the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Union officials complained Monday that their drivers make half as
much as drivers employed by the district, and said they are seeking
5% increases in pay for each of the next three years. They also are
seeking better health and retirement benefits.</LD>
<TE>   "We want a living wage," said Lonnie Holmes, business
representative for Teamsters Local 572.</TE>
<TE>   He said the union has no immediate strike plans. But district
officials believed the union's threats to walk out were credible
enough to send letters last week informing parents that a bus strike
could be imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The letter warns that "some buses will have to make separate trips
and your child's bus may run late."</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw officials declined to comment in detail on the
negotiations, saying only that they had put their "best and final"
offer on the table in February. Holmes said that offer was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Under the district's contingency plan, buses could be delayed by
as much as 90 minutes while district drivers and other contractors
double back to pick up extra kids, said schools Transportation Branch
Director Antonio A. Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a strike, many students would be late for school, and
field trips, athletic events and after-school activities might be
curtailed, Rodriguez said. Students might also leave school later
than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who could not recall a bus drivers' strike in his 11
years with the district, said he did not know how much money the
district would have to pay for increased overtime to carry Laidlaw's
load.</TE>
<TE>   District officials expect that many parents will drive their
children to school and that older students will use city buses and
trains.</TE>
<TE>   School board member David Tokofsky said he is concerned that
because district bus dispatchers, who handle all bus traffic, also
are members of Local 572, their services might be affected by a
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 10% of district students are bused. Many are among the most
severely handicapped special education students. Other children are
bused under desegregation plans to magnet schools and other campuses
with enough space for out-of-area students.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw handles about a third of the district's bus routes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really the innocent bystander in all of this," Rodriguez
said. The district is not involved in labor negotiations and is
prohibited from taking sides, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Laidlaw contracts with many school districts in the
region and has other dealings with Teamsters drivers, the
negotiations affect only Los Angeles Unified buses, Laidlaw Vice
President Jim Ferraro said.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw is the nation's largest school bus operator, running
30,000 routes every day. Los Angeles Unified is one of the
Burlington, Canada, company's biggest contracts, Ferraro said.</TE>
<TE>   Hasan Ikhrata, manager of transportation planning for the Southern
California Assn. of Governments, said the effect of such a strike on
Los Angeles roads and public transit would be limited and possibly
imperceptible.</TE>

<HD>Group to Select 5 Valley City Names for Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hope and Camelot are still in the running, as are Valley of the Stars
and Nuevo Fernando. But the proposed San Fernando Valley city will
not be called Smogadena or Hellish Pit O'Despair, as some have
suggested.</LD>
<LD>   Valley VOTE, the group spearheading the secession drive, has
narrowed the list of possible city names to 25 from the more than 400
suggested by the public, said Jeff Brain, the group's president.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, Valley VOTE will hold a public meeting to choose the five
options that will go on the November ballot, along with the question
of whether the Valley should secede and form its own city.</LD>
<TE>   After public testimony, the 45-member board of directors hopes to
pick five names before the sun comes up.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's an important step," Brain said. "All in all, people
took it very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   In winnowing the list, Brain said the group tried to pick the most
popular suggestions, but stayed away from those that might be
confusing or infringe on another city's name, such as San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the finalists have the word "valley" in the name,
including El Valle, Valley City, New Valley City, Valleywood and San
Fernando Valley. Others allude to the climate and history of the
place, such as Golden Valley, Mission Valley, Valley View and Sun
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are New Los Angeles, North Los Angeles and San
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Some come from street names, such as Lankershim and Mulholland
City.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are Camelot and Hope, which suggest the proposed
city's dreams for itself. Asphalt Prairie didn't make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the public can vote online (www.valleyvote.org) until
noon. Only one vote per person will be counted.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's meeting will be at 6:45 at Galpin Ford, 15555 Roscoe
Blvd., North Hills, in the second-floor conference room.</TE>

<HD>New Consul Promises Changes</HD>
<DH>Immigration: Fernando Gamboa Rosas seeks to relocate the
consulate from the Oxnard bus station and expand services to Mexican
citizens in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fernando Gamboa Rosas started his new job as Mexican consul in
Ventura County last week, and already he plans changes for his
Oxnard-based office.</LD>
<LD>   By July, Gamboa Rosas expects to relocate the consulate to a
larger building that's more visible, handicapped accessible and able
to handle a recent surge of immigrants seeking Mexican passports. He
also wants to upgrade equipment and hire at least five additional
employees to reduce the amount of time it takes to issue a passport.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the new reality," he said. "We have to be more efficient
in order to serve the people well."</LD>
<TE>   Gamboa Rosas, 51, took over as Mexican consul on March 26,
replacing Luz Elena Bueno Zirion, who left in February to take a
diplomatic position in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   An architect who specializes in social and rural development,
Gamboa Rosas has worked in public service for 25 years, most recently
for the secretary of health in Mexico City. He oversees 20 employees
at the consulate, which is now in second-floor offices above the
downtown Greyhound terminal, at 201 E. 4th St.</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrival, Gamboa Rosas has been meeting with consulate
staff members and contacting local government officials, making
arrangements to discuss issues important to the Mexican community.
His office serves Mexican immigrants mainly in Ventura, Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   He has also begun searching for a house in Oxnard, where he will
live with his wife, Marian, and his two youngest children, ages 6 and
8, who will arrive when the school year concludes. He has children
from a previous marriage, ages 19 and 24, who will remain in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Mayor Manuel M. Lopez hopes Gamboa Rosas will build on the
initiatives supported by his predecessor, particularly in the areas
of improved housing, employment and law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Bueno Zirion "was really an outstanding person and was able to
bridge the different cultures and backgrounds," Lopez said. "I'm sure
he'll be able to do that also."</TE>
<TE>   An Advocate for Mexican Citizens</TE>
<TE>   The consulate also encourages tourism to Mexico, issues temporary
work visas and educates immigrating Mexican citizens on U.S. laws. It
also issues matricula consular cards that Mexican immigrants can use
as a primary form of ID to open checking or savings accounts at
certain banks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Mexican consul speaks on behalf of the Mexican
community. For instance, if a Mexican-born resident with limited
English skills is in trouble with the law, the consul often appears
with the person in court to act as an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said he hopes the new consul will
assist with another concern. Migrant workers often lack proper
identification to open bank accounts and fall victim to thieves who
steal their cash. Lopez wants more Mexican immigrants establishing
bank accounts, especially before the harvest season begins.</TE>
<TE>   "We want [the consulate] to develop an identification card that
the banks can use, so we don't have migrant workers ... carrying
large sums of money around," the chief said. "They can put it in the
bank and have the money transferred and transmitted to Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Gamboa Rosas plans to distribute fliers and posters to encourage
immigrants to get proper identification from the consulate.</TE>
<TE>   The office is already flooded with applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the number of Mexican natives seeking passports
and other forms of ID has tripled to 150 per day. Some people wait up
to six hours, arriving three hours before the consulate opens at 8
a.m. to be first in line.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, about 60 people jammed the small office,
waiting for their names to be called. They soothed cranky babies, sat
quietly in chairs and formed lines in the hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Helping With Passports an Important Service</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Perez, an auto mechanic from North Hills, arrived at 6 a.m.
to obtain a passport for an upcoming meeting with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. By noon, Perez was still waiting. He passed
time sipping coffee and chatting with others in line. "It's a long
time to wait," said Perez, 42. "That's the only problem."</TE>
<TE>   It normally takes three to four hours to obtain a passport, Gamboa
Rosas said. Staff members need to verify names, birth dates and other
pertinent information. They also have to make sure all documents
submitted by applicants are authentic. Still, he hopes to cut the
wait to two hours by enlarging his staff and acquiring new computers
and other equipment that helps make passports more difficult to
counterfeit.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, the Mexican government approved a request by
Gamboa Rosas' predecessor to relocate the consulate to a larger
building. Two alternate locations in downtown Oxnard are being
considered, one an abandoned Woolworth store, the other in a former
Bank of America branch.</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects his superiors in Mexico City to make a decision
on a new site in coming weeks.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Reports Homicides Up Sharply in 1st Quarter</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The numbers of homicides and other serious crimes in Los Angeles
during the first three months of 2002 were sharply higher than for
the same period last year, according to police statistics released
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   From Jan. 1 to March 30, 153 people were slain in Los Angeles, up
from 105 during the first quarter of 2001, according to the Los
Angeles Police Department's Information Technology Division.</LD>
<LD>   After 1999--when total homicides hit a 30-year low of 425--the
city has had two successive years in which killings have been on the
rise. There were 584 homicides in Los Angeles during 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The LAPD statistics show rapes increased from 252 during the first
quarter of 2001 to 342 so far this year, robberies went from 3,670 to
4,392, and aggravated assaults climbed from 3,888 at this time last
year to 4,466.</TE>
<TE>   Burglaries were down from 6,235 last year to 6,183 so far this
year, and larcenies were down from 19,857 to 19,659.</TE>
<TE>   The first-quarter numbers show that the division with the most
homicides so far this year was 77th Street, which has had 34. All of
the other 17 divisions had at least one homicide, ranging from
Hollenbeck and Southeast, with 17 each, to West Los Angeles with one.</TE>
<TE>   The department reported making 12% fewer arrests during the
quarter than it did at the beginning of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD representatives did not return calls for comment Monday.</TE>

<HD>2 Die in Unrelated Shootings in Neighborhood</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police are investigating two apparently unrelated fatal
shootings that occurred within a mile of each other late Sunday in
the Jefferson Park area.</LD>
<LD>   A 28-year-old man was shot while he stood outside a house in the
3600 block of South 8th Avenue about 10:50 p.m. Sunday, according to
authorities. Two men shot him several times and ran off, Officer Jack
Richter said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was found with gunshot wounds to his stomach and died
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Craig Harvey at the Los Angeles
County coroner's office.</LD>
<TE>   About half an hour later, another man was gunned down. Witnesses
said four men in an older-model car opened fire on three men as they
stood outside a home in the 3700 block of South St. Andrews Place
near Exposition Boulevard, a mile west of the first shooting, Richter
said.</TE>
<TE>   A 25-year-old man was shot several times in the back and died at
Cedars-Sinai. The other two men were treated and released, Richter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives, who did not identify any of the victims, said the
shootings do not appear to be related.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a case of retaliation," Richter said. "These were
two entirely different shootings."</TE>

<HD>More Students Training as Drug Counselors</HD>
<DH>Education: Interest is booming since changes in state law.
Nearly all trainees are in recovery or have a relative with a
dependency problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard College's Intervention and Recovery class is an eclectic
group--from an elegantly dressed Ojai mother who has lost a daughter
to heroin to ex-gang members from La Colonia and reformed meth
dealers.</LD>
<LD>   They are all studying to become certified drug and alcohol
counselors through the addictive disorders program--one of the
state's oldest college-based training grounds for chemical dependency
professionals.</LD>
<LD>   "You have everybody, all the way from 17- or 18-year-olds up to
grandparents. You have your [recovering] alcoholics or drug
addicts--the ones who got themselves together before they had to go
to prison--and you have a lot of parolees in the room," said student
Kris Giles, 33, of Newbury Park. "We are all on the same level."</LD>
<TE>   Spurred by statewide efforts to raise standards for drug
counselors and the passage of Proposition 36, which mandated
treatment over jail time for certain low-level drug offenders,
enrollment in this and similar programs at 26 other community
colleges has exploded. This semester, Oxnard's program has more than
400 students, compared with 275 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all the students are in recovery or have a family member
with a drug or alcohol problem, said William Shilley, 73, a former
priest turned family therapist who founded the program in 1981. To
become certified, students must complete 720 hours--about two years
of course work--and 250 hours of field experience.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the students, enrolling in an academic program with a
fixed schedule is a huge step. Many have histories that include
childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, prostitution or addiction.
They have limited education and struggle with financial difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all walking miracles because they have been through an
awful lot and they have done one of the most difficult things to do
in life, which is change their lifestyle," Shilley said.</TE>
<TE>   Many program alumni now hold leadership positions at alcohol and
drug rehab facilities in Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Shilley teaches most of the 19 courses in the Oxnard College
program's curriculum. As a founding member of the California Assn.
for Alcohol/Drug Educators, he also travels around the state setting
up continuing education courses, lobbying lawmakers and advising drug
and alcohol treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill is the professional in the state," said association
President Angela Stocker, director of the College of San Mateo's
addictive disorders program. "He has done more to raise the standards
for counselors than any one person."</TE>
<TE>   Shilley's students see him as a mentor and compassionate father
figure.</TE>
<TE>   "He looks for the best in everyone and makes them feel like he
respects them and cares personally about them," said Deborah Goldberg
of Westlake Village, who with her husband, Leonard, were Shilley
students a decade ago when their daughter was using drugs.</TE>
<TE>   With Shilley's help, the Goldbergs established Visions for
Recovery, a nonprofit group that raises money for alcohol and drug
prevention programs.</TE>
<TE>   Shilley's students say they attend the program as a way to make up
for the years and relationships they lost to their addictions.</TE>
<TE>   "It blows me away that I have so much knowledge from my personal
research that I can help someone else," said Elizabeth Humphrey, 38,
who has been sober for three years and enrolled in the program last
fall. "The best counselors are people in recovery because we already
know the games, we know the manipulation, and we know the conning. We
can't be fooled."</TE>
<TE>   Shilley estimates that about half his students end up completing
the program. Some decide that drug counseling does not pay enough and
pursue other careers. Others leave when they have a relapse.</TE>
<TE>   A few find that their pasts catch up with them. This semester, for
example, two students dropped out because they were sent to jail.</TE>
<TE>   But many find the strength to continue. One is the mother of a
former pupil who couldn't get off heroin. The Ojai woman said she has
not seen her 23-year-old daughter since November and doesn't know
where she is, but thinks using her child's old textbooks and sitting
in the same classroom she once did gives her hope.</TE>

<HD>Suspect's Suicide Is Latest Twist in Bizarre Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: The woman, who fled California after poisoning her
husband, hangs self in Florida jail. Arraignment is set for alleged
accomplice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- For six months she had somehow lived with it.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say Laren Renee Sims killed her husband in September,
poisoning his water bottle with a horse tranquilizer. She stowed the
body in a garage freezer, then liquidated his worldly possessions,
they say. He was buried in a farm field. Sims fled across the country
in a red Jaguar. Within weeks, the local sheriff was branding her a
''black widow.''</LD>
<LD>   When the law caught up with Sims and she found herself behind
bars, there still was a way out. Over the weekend, she hanged herself
in a Florida jail cell with a rope authorities say she fashioned from
her bedsheets.</LD>
<TE>   Sims' death leaves detectives and prosecutors in San Joaquin
County, where the body of attorney Larry McNabney was discovered in
February, puzzling over countless questions.</TE>
<TE>   And authorities are left with a case that is very much alive. On
Wednesday, Sarah Dutra, a 21-year-old Cal State Sacramento art
student, faces arraignment on charges that she helped Sims plan the
killing of McNabney to share in the spoils of his estate and law
practice. If convicted of McNabney's murder, she could face the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Sims, who went by the name of Elissa McNabney during her life as
the attorney's wife, was Dutra's chief accuser. In a three-page
statement she gave after her arrest in the resort town of Destin in
the Florida Panhandle, Sims said Dutra helped plan and carry out the
crime, all for financial gain.</TE>
<TE>   Her handwritten statement alleged that Dutra took part in the
poisoning, then helped transport McNabney, still semiconscious, to
Yosemite National Park, where the two planned to bury him, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sims said in the statement that she could not go through with the
burial while McNabney was still alive, so they took him home, where
he died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   She offered no motive.</TE>
<TE>   ''As human beings we struggle to understand why someone would do
this,'' said Thomas Testa, a San Joaquin County deputy district
attorney. Authorities now may never find answers to several key
questions, he said, the biggest one being the motive for the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Was it the money? Sims purportedly fled after squeezing as much as
$500,000 out of McNabney's business and savings. Or was it, Testa
wondered, that the woman who spent her 20s jumping from alias to
alias, petty crime to petty crime, may simply have embodied ''pure
evil?''</TE>
<TE>   After McNabney's slaying, he said, Sims at one point stuffed her
husband's body into the trunk of her car and drove to Las Vegas to
gamble and party while hunting for some place to bury him.</TE>
<TE>   In the signed confession, Sims said she was alone when she buried
McNabney in a vineyard. But she said Dutra--for two years a secretary
at the law firm--helped her plan the murder while the trio attended a
horse show Sept. 10 in Los Angeles County. Though the college
student, a gifted art major and former senior class president in high
school, was not the brains behind the slaying, prosecutors said, she
was a willing participant.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Dutra made incriminating statements to
investigators before her arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Sims were still alive, Testa said her written confession
could not be used in court against Dutra. By law, he said, one
criminal defendant cannot be called by prosecutors to testify against
another. But the case against Dutra remains solid, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dutra's attorney, Kevin Clymo of Sacramento, did not return phone
calls Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Dutra was willingly led into the slaying
by Sims. Dutra, they say, was in awe of Sims and relished the
prospect of a high life on McNabney's money.</TE>
<TE>   During Dutra's tenure at the law firm, she and Sims became
friends, going on shopping sprees and wearing matching outfits.</TE>

<HD>4 Local Agencies Claim DWP Overcharges of $200 Million</HD>
<DH>Courts: Complaint alleges bills were inflated. Utility
official says rates are fair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four government agencies, including Los Angeles County and the Los
Angeles Unified School District, have joined in a $600-million
complaint against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
alleging that the public utility deliberately inflated the electric
bills of government agencies operating in the city.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Superior Court complaint, made public Monday, the
DWP overcharged the local government agencies for the past 10 years
by levying special assessments for capital improvement projects. The
DWP, in turn, gave rate breaks to residential customers, an attorney
for the agencies said in an interview.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the county and school district, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the Los Angeles County Community College
District have joined the suit. The state, which filed a similar claim
against the DWP two weeks ago, is expected to sign onto the
litigation later this month.</LD>
<TE>   DWP officials, who have also come under fire from City Controller
Laura Chick for spending too much money on parties and perks, deny
any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "All our rates are fair and equitable," said Frank Salas, the
DWP's chief operating officer. "We have had our rates reviewed by
experts. We are not overcharging anybody.... It's amazing how
everyone seems to be picking on us."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was initiated by energy consultant Sam Barakat under
the state whistle-blower law known as the California False Claims
Act. According to the lead attorney on the case, Barakat came across
the alleged irregularities when he obtained an internal DWP report
while working as an energy consultant for another school district in
the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew people at the DWP and he started asking questions," said
San Francisco attorney Eric R. Havian, who represents several of the
entities bringing the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Barakat filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court in June
2000. It was filed under seal to give the governmental agencies time
to determine whether the allegations had merit. The suit became
public on Monday, after the four agencies agreed to join the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We did an independent investigation," said Bob Cartwright, a
senior deputy Los Angeles County counsel. "DWP's own records show
they were charging in excess. Given that it has been a long-standing
practice, we determined that we needed to take action."</TE>
<TE>   According to the suit, the DWP deliberately disregarded a state
law that prohibits publicly owned utilities from charging schools and
other governmental customers more than their share for capital costs.
For example, Havian said, if a state agency uses 5% of the power
generated by an electrical facility, it should be charged no more
than 5% of the facility's capital costs.</TE>
<TE>   The government agencies believe they have been charged up to 60%
more than their legitimate share of capital costs, topping $200
million in overcharges, Havian said. The agencies are seeking $600
million in damages from the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP has been coming under increased scrutiny in recent months.
During the energy crisis, the utility increased its generation and
sold excess power. But some consumer groups and government officials
have alleged that the utility took excessive profits.</TE>
<TE>   On March 22, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed a claim against the DWP
alleging that the municipal agency inflated the bills paid by state
government entities located in the city, ranging from the Ronald
Reagan Office Building to Department of Motor Vehicles offices. The
claim, a required step before the state can join the lawsuit with the
other government agencies, is seeking total damages of $180 million.</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Votes to Cut Auto Emissions</HD>
<DH>Environment: A bill to reduce carbon dioxide from car
tailpipes after 2008 as a way to fight global warming moves closer to
full Senate vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A potentially far-reaching bill that would make California the first
state to specifically target automobile exhaust emissions believed to
contribute to global warming scored a victory in the Senate on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Over the opposition of the automotive industry, including
politically influential new-car dealers, the bill won approval of the
Environmental Quality Committee on a party-line vote of 5 to 2,
Democrats to Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   The bill now advances to the Appropriations Committee for another
hearing, the final stop before action by the full Senate. Officials
of the Davis administration have not taken a position on the bill.</LD>
<TE>   For environmental organizations, passage of the Assembly-approved
plan marked a hard-fought victory against a well-heeled industry that
often gets its way, especially in election years when new-car dealers
have been generous donors to political campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, AB1058, by first-term Assemblywoman Fran Pavley
(D-Agoura Hills), would require the state Air Resources Board to
adopt regulations by 2005 that would reduce tailpipe emissions of
carbon dioxide from passenger cars and light trucks and other
noncommercial motor vehicles. The actual implementation of the rules
would not apply to cars and trucks made before the 2008 model year.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley and proponents of the bill, including the Clean Air
Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Fund, Sierra Club, American Lung
Assn. and the city and county of Los Angeles, said global warming is
becoming a threat to public health, farm production and delicate
coastal ecosystems and, in California, may cause premature melting of
the Sierra snowpack.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the bill claimed that a regulatory system by California
would offer a "negligible" effect on global warming.</TE>
<TE>   But Pavley told the committee that California must take a
leadership role in the fight against global warming, as it has in
reducing smog, even if the reductions of carbon dioxide were meager.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do our fair share as the fifth-biggest economy of the
world," Pavley said, especially since the Bush administration has
dismissed joining with other nations to combat global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley noted that the bill specifically prohibits the air board
from outlawing the sale of any class of car or truck, including sport
utility vehicles, or from imposing mandatory trip-reduction schemes
on motorists.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents warned that the legislation was so loosely drafted
that no one could reasonably predict what steps the Air Resources
Board might take to carry out requirements that it produce the
"maximum feasible and cost-effective" reduction possible in
greenhouse gases.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, lobbyists representing the Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers and the California New Car Dealers Assn.
testified that the bill could result in higher car prices and fewer
choices for consumers because no one could predict how the board's
reductions would be implemented.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Sheila Kuehl of Santa Monica, a Democrat who coauthored
the bill, recalled that the automobile industry historically has
fought changes, including tougher safety standards and stricter smog
controls.</TE>
<TE>   The industry lost those fights and eventually found ways to
comply, she noted.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Contain 3 Brush Fires</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 400 firefighters in northern Los Angeles County on Monday
battled three brush fires fueled by the unusually dry weather.</LD>
<LD>   A 133-acre blaze in the Angeles National Forest was contained
after a two-day battle.</LD>
<LD>   One fire in Santa Clarita and another in Porter Ranch were brought
under control in the afternoon, within hours after starting,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   County firefighters were joined by Los Angeles city and Ventura
County crews. They were aided by about half a dozen water-dropping
helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   One county firefighter suffered minor injuries in the forest fire,
but no one else was hurt and no structures were damaged in the
blazes, Fire Department spokesman Michael Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The forest fire--in an area about 10 miles east of the Golden
State Freeway and five miles south of the Antelope Highway--was
fast-moving at times, because portions of the area had been untouched
by flames for 50 years, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty acres of a Santa Clarita hillside near Lake Castaic were
burned in a fire that began shortly after noon. Rising on a steep
incline, the fire initially moved at a 5-mph pace, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Another brush fire that started about 1 p.m. burned about 15 acres
in a Porter Ranch subdivision. Because there was little wind, the
fire remained in a bowl along the northwest end of the Renaissance
housing development near Mason Avenue and Sesnon Boulevard,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The causes of the fires have not been determined, but
investigators found no signs of arson, Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Grand Jury System Retooled</HD>
<DH>Courts: Recent rulings found that too few women serve. So
rather than choosing panels from volunteers, prospective juror pool
will be tapped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Effective immediately, residents reporting for jury duty in Ventura
County Superior Court could be tapped to serve on a grand jury, a new
system triggered by rulings that the current system underrepresents
women.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, volunteers applied to serve on the grand jury and were
selected by Superior Court judges for a one-year term to hear
criminal cases and investigate the affairs of local government.</LD>
<LD>   Now, like regular jury duty, prospective grand jurors will be sent
to a courtroom, where a judge will consider requests to be excused
due to economic hardship or child-care needs depending on the
anticipated length of the case.</LD>
<TE>   Those chosen would then hear testimony in closed-door proceedings
to determine whether the district attorney has sufficient evidence to
bring charges against a suspect. Jurors are expected to hear one or
possibly two cases.</TE>
<TE>   The new system is intended to result in more diverse grand jury
panels.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a wide spectrum of views and experiences," said Public
Defender Kenneth I. Clayman, whose office successfully challenged the
grand jury's makeup in two death-penalty murder cases. "This is a
great step forward."</TE>
<TE>   To prevent challenges based on the makeup of the grand jury, Dist.
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury eight years ago asked that county judges
switch to this system. But he didn't receive much support.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts had always ruled that the process was constitutional
and to change it would be costly," Bradbury said. "I think there was
a reluctance to incur those burdens if it was unnecessary."</TE>
<TE>   But in February, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Frank
Ochoa determined that the volunteer system was flawed because it
resulted in too few women being placed on the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Although Ochoa found there was no intentional discrimination, he
concluded that Ventura County's 2000-01 grand jury did not represent
a fair cross-section of the community as required by law and ordered
the indictment of 32-year-old murder suspect Michael Schultz set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz is accused of strangling a Port Hueneme woman in 1993
during a home burglary. Prosecutors have refiled rape and murder
charges, but the case is on hold pending an appeal on a separate
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Ochoa overturned a second indictment, against
30-year-old murder suspect Vincent Sanchez, citing the same problems
with the 2001-02 grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors refiled charges against Sanchez, who is accused of
shooting and trying to rape a 20-year-old Moorpark College student
last summer. A preliminary hearing is set for next week.</TE>
<TE>   Since Ochoa's rulings, at least two other murder suspects have
sought dismissal of their indictments by that grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   In one of those cases, prosecutors recently agreed to scrap the
indictment and file a new criminal complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa's ruling also played a role in the drug and racketeering
case against local Hells Angels members and their associates.
Prosecutors last month cut deals with three defendants, including
local Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr., citing, in part,
challenges brought after Ochoa's ruling in the Schultz case.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not ruled out an appeal of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Ochoa's ruling, or the process we were using, damaged some very
important cases we put a lot of time and effort into," Bradbury said.
"We don't want to have to deal with more of these significant legal
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Court officials are still trying to work out kinks with the new
grand jury system, such as determining where these special grand
juries will convene.</TE>
<TE>   But in light of the recent rulings, officials decided it was time
to make a change. "Because of the indictments set aside in Santa
Barbara ... it was determined that this would be a good way to go,"
said Jury Services Manager Peggy Yost, who researched grand jury
practices in several other counties.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that in San Francisco and Los Angeles, they have a very
established criminal grand jury that sits for 90 days at a time,"
Yost said. "Many others do it this way, in an as-needed basis, and
they seem to have been successful."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, court officials are continuing to solicit volunteers to
serve on the second panel, the so-called watchdog grand jury, which
convenes July 1 and will continue to investigate local government.</TE>
<TE>   Applications and information are available through jury services
at (805) 654-5025. The application deadline is April 19.</TE>

<HD>Marjorie Holmes, 91; Inspirational Author</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marjorie Holmes, an inspirational author and columnist often called
"the patron saint of housewives" and whose work was panned by critics
but embraced by readers who made many of her 32 books bestsellers,
has died. She was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Holmes died March 13 at a nursing home in Manassas, Va., following
a series of strokes.</LD>
<LD>   The Iowa-born writer had a knack for making God and biblical
personages accessible to ordinary people and for relating religion
and prayer to such real-life challenges as women's liberation and the
drug culture.</LD>
<TE>   Holmes wrote a twice-weekly syndicated column, "Love and
Laughter," for the now-defunct Washington, D.C., Star from 1959 to
1973 and a monthly column, "A Woman's Conversations With God," for
the same paper from 1970 to 1975.</TE>
<TE>   She also wrote regularly for the Daily Guideposts publication and
for McCall's, Reader's Digest and Ladies' Home Journal magazines.</TE>
<TE>   But her books gained her a much wider audience.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was the highly popular fictionalized trilogy of the
birth and life of Jesus Christ--"Two From Galilee" published in 1972,
"Three From Galilee: The Young Man From Nazareth" in 1985, and "The
Messiah" in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Typically expressing what critics thought of much of Holmes'
writing, David Streitfeld sniffed in the Washington Post Book World:
"Marjorie Holmes' 'Two From Galilee,' although no doubt deeply felt,
is awkward enough to be cited in bad-writing seminars."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the book sold millions and was one of the 10 best-selling
novels of 1972. The novel about the love story of Mary and Joseph was
also a personal favorite of the author.</TE>
<TE>   "Two From Galilee," Holmes told the Dallas News, "means more to me
than anything else I have ever written. If I had never written
anything else besides this book, I would still feel like I had
accomplished something."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why the trilogy had been so incredibly successful, Holmes
said, "I made the Holy Family as real as the folks next door."</TE>
<TE>   Also among Holmes' bestsellers were four books of conversational
prayers, beginning with the 1969 volume "I've Got to Talk to
Somebody, God."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes turned major events in her own life into books. When Lynn
Mighell, her husband of 47 years, died of cancer in 1979, she wrote
about her efforts to prolong his life.</TE>
<TE>   The result was "God and Vitamins: How Exercise, Diet and Faith Can
Change Your Life," which a Times reviewer called "a delicious,
personable book for everyone--even atheists.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on common sense, sound medical guidance and personal
guinea-pigism," the reviewer continued, "the book dispenses a
cornucopia of excellent advice about the body human and what it needs
to survive our stress-laden, additive-polluted world. A word of
warning: The food descriptions could make you drool."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes wrote another book in that period about easing grief, "To
Help You Through the Hurting," and soon met an appreciative reader
who became her second husband, Dr. George Schmieler, who had just
lost his first wife. That union led to another book, "Second Wife,
Second Life." Schmieler died in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Educated at Buena Vista and Cornell colleges in Iowa, Holmes tried
farming in Texas and worked in radio in Illinois and Ohio, scripting
fashion shows and children's programs.</TE>
<TE>   She published her first novel, "World by the Tail," in 1943, and
for the next few years wrote books for teenage girls.</TE>
<TE>   Her inspirational books largely began with "Love and Laughter,"
the 1967 collection of her columns.</TE>
<TE>   She lectured widely throughout her career, and taught writing in
various seminars and at Washington-area universities.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is survived by three children, a sister, six grandchildren
and seven great-grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>A 21-year-old woman was fatally shot and an unidentified 15-year-old

<HD>Man Kills Neighbor Who Made Complaint</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Gunman also dies, perhaps from a ricochet, after
he ambushes victim in San Clemente. Note said second killing planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Clemente man on Monday shot and killed a downstairs neighbor
who for weeks had complained about the loud noise and music coming
from his apartment, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, Jaroslav Liska, 47, was gunned down in the complex's
carport about 9 a.m., shortly after witnesses heard shouting. Moments
later, the suspect, Peter Mehran, 25, also died, suffering a head
wound that police said may have been caused by a ricochet from his
own semiautomatic pistol.</LD>
<LD>   Police also found a handwritten note inside Mehran's car
describing plans for a second, unrelated killing--including details
about how he would change his appearance and dispose of the evidence
afterward, Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.</LD>
<TE>   Neighbors in the community, just a few blocks from the beach,
expressed shock at how a routine feud between neighbors could turn
into a shooting rampage with at least a dozen rounds fired.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe," said Jerry Anderson, who owns the
building. "Maybe it was [as simple as] noise from walking around ...
that was upsetting to the bottom unit."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors heard shouting and then a flurry of gunfire outside the
Baha Park Apartments at 3204 Avenida del Presidente.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that Mehran was waiting for the victim in
the carport.</TE>
<TE>   Liska's girlfriend and at least one neighbor witnessed the
shooting, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth, and I heard
pop-pop-pop-pop!--about 12 shots," said Donald Morin, 36, a personal
trainer who lives in the apartment complex next door.</TE>
<TE>   Morin said he saw the gunman firing wildly under the cement
carport.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was shooting at random: He was shooting toward
the right and shooting to the left, like he was mad. Then he shot one
up in the air," Morin said. "He shot up right in the air. The
carport's overhang was right above him. It looked like it ricocheted
and hit him."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are still trying to determine whether the gunman
turned the gun on himself or was killed by a stray bullet, Amormino
said. Police initially suspected suicide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of fears that there might be a second gunman, police
cordoned of the block, and a sheriff's SWAT unit swept through the
apartment complex, igniting a flash grenade in the gunman's
apartment. Nothing suspicious was found, and police believe Mehran
acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   The playground at Concordia Elementary School is just yards away,
but the school was empty Monday because of spring break.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment building's owner said the gunman had been living
there for about two months and had never caused trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The victim made several complaints about noise from the apartment
above him, he said.</TE>

<HD>Residents Tire of Being Kept in Dark</HD>
<DH>Services: They have been trying for decades to get street
lights for their crime-plagued Pacoima neighborhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roberto and Laura Bernal wait for luz.</LD>
<LD>   Light, they say, will make them feel safer in their Pacoima
neighborhood, which the Los Angeles Bureau of Street Lighting
identifies as one of the most poorly lighted in the city.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of the 95-home district, part of the Bromont Avenue and
Eustace Street lighting district, have been trying to get street
lights for 40 years. The area, which is also home to City Council
President Alex Padilla, is bordered by the Ronald Reagan Freeway to
the south, Vaughn Street to the north, Dronfield Avenue to the west
and Foothill Boulevard to the east.</LD>
<TE>   Padilla acknowledges his constituents' frustration and points out
that even his street has no lights.</TE>
<TE>   The council president said he has tried to get local businesses to
join with the city to pay for the lights' installation but has had no
luck.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla also said he's waiting for federal block grant money to
become available.</TE>
<TE>   Residents complain that Padilla has done little to fulfill
campaign promises he made three years ago to find money for lights.</TE>
<TE>   "Once he moved up the ladder [to council president], he forgot
about us," said Richard Gallegos, who lives in the area and is the
chief community inspector for Pacoima Beautiful, a nonprofit group
that seeks to improve the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's spokesman, David Gershwin, said the councilman has been
working diligently for the lights. "It's a difficult process. We're
not making any excuses," he said. "I think we are on track; we are
seeing more progress than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a letter from the city's Bureau of Street Lighting told
residents that 35 lights would be installed in their neighborhood,
but funding was never found. In February 2000, the City Council
approved $20,000 for street lights, a small fraction of the $170,000
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Reed, director of the Bureau of Street Lighting, said the 35
lights are ready to be installed, as soon as all the funding is
found.</TE>
<TE>   So the Bernals continue to wait.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of taxing
themselves $53 a year to maintain and operate the lights.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, residents also would pay for installation and
construction, which costs about $1,600 per property owner. That
option is unlikely for Pacoima, residents and city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about families who make less than $30,000 a year,
with three to four children and homes to pay for," Gallegos said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Bernal, a carpenter, said he would like to pay for the
lights, but can't afford to.</TE>
<TE>   "Lights aren't really a luxury," Gallegos said. "I don't
understand why we have to fight for something so basic."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Lead Officer Cedric Ingram of the Los Angeles Police
Department said the low-income, high-crime area would benefit from
street lights. Pacoima leads the San Fernando Valley in aggravated
assaults, and in February alone, there were 39 violent crimes there,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bromont-Eustace area is plagued by drug houses and gang turf
wars between Dead End Boyz, Pacoima Piru Bloods, Vaughn Street Gang
and San Fers Gang, Ingram said.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys operate under the cover of darkness and that allows
them to remain anonymous," he said. "It's like hide-and-go-seek."</TE>
<TE>   Lights would help police be more effective, Ingram said. "There
are times when you're out there at night and the only light you have
are your headlights," he said. "It's totally dark."</TE>
<TE>   The Bernals said the darkness aids taggers who spray gang symbols
on the concrete wall outside their home at least three times a month.</TE>
<TE>   Dim lights in yards and the lone light post on the street
do little to stop prostitution and illegal dumping of refrigerators,
tires and other discards, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bernal said she tells her five children to stop playing on
the sidewalk after dark because it's unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Older, largely poor neighborhoods, like Pacoima, often don't have
the infrastructure for lighting systems, Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the 1950s, when much of Pacoima was developed, home
builders were not required to install street lights.</TE>
<TE>   To put them up now would be a major construction project,
requiring the installation of foundations for the light posts,
electrical conduits and wiring, Reed said.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegos said he has learned to depend on moonlight. "Without the
full moon, it would be pitch-dark," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bernals wonder if they will always live in darkness. "Ayudenos
a garar nuestras luces," Roberto Bernal said. "Help us get our
lights."</TE>

<HD>Airlines Fight for Space at Long Beach Airport</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Alaska joins American in seeking to take over
unused slots held by JetBlue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM and JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just last spring, Long Beach officials were begging airlines to
provide service at the city's 79-year-old airport. No more. Today,
several carriers are fighting to fill their jets from the airport's
Art Deco-style terminal.</LD>
<LD>   Since low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways opened its West Coast hub
last summer at the tiny airport alongside the San Diego Freeway,
passenger traffic has climbed 41%. JetBlue expects to increase its
flights at Long Beach from three to 27 a day in the next year.</LD>
<LD>   Now, other airlines want access to the "slots" that the upstart
carrier isn't using.</LD>
<TE>   And the tiny airport finds itself with too many suitors--saying
that it may be able to offer only temporary takeoff and departure
times to other airlines. That is not good enough for at least one
carrier, American Airlines, which has threatened to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Space at Long Beach Airport is scarce because of a 1995 federal
lawsuit settlement that limited the number of commercial takeoffs at
the airport to 41 per day. That was in response to local efforts to
reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   All 41 of these slots are now reserved by airlines. Some are in
use; others are being held for flights that are supposed to be added
later.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines would like to add four more flights daily, to
Chicago and New York, on top of the four it offers to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   And, after a seven-year absence from Long Beach, Alaska Airlines
announced Monday that it will request three slots, for flights to
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   American has upped the ante in the debate by selling tickets for
the additional Long Beach flights, even before airport officials
agree to make room for the extra planes.</TE>
<TE>   Airline representatives said federal law requires airport
officials to accommodate their requests to add service at the
facility--wedged between overcrowded Los Angeles International
Airport to the north and John Wayne Airport to the south, which also
operates under flight restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that only 17 of their 41 jet slots are
in use," said Al Becker, an American spokesman. "We have no desire to
enter into litigation with the city of Long Beach, and our sincere
hope and wish is that we can resolve this issue amicably. All we want
to do is operate our service and be able to compete."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the 1995 settlement, the airlines and the city were
prohibited from suing each other for six years. The litigation truce
period ended Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach City Council, which operates the airport, is
scheduled to discuss the matter today in closed session.</TE>
<TE>   American said it began selling tickets on the proposed flights
from Long Beach to New York and Chicago because it will have at least
temporary slots at the city-run facility when the service begins June
15.</TE>
<TE>   Airport administrators said they offered American the use of
temporary slots when the airline filed its initial request for
service in February. But the company turned the airport down, said
Sharon Diggs-Jackson, the facility's public affairs officer. The
airport also asked airlines that use its facility if they would
relinquish some of their slots to American. The competitors refused.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, American has been offered a temporary solution: Use slots
promised to other airlines that are yet to expand their own
schedules. But most of those spots probably will disappear by next
spring, when the other carriers add their flights, Diggs-Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   American said it is determined to have the airport dedicate four
more permanent slots for its planes.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers said the attempts by more established carriers
to compete with JetBlue at Long Beach have historical precedent:
Bigger airlines traditionally have challenged smaller carriers when
they start to gain a foothold on lucrative routes.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago if you went to American and said, 'Hey guys, how about
coming to Long Beach?' their answer would have been, 'Why?'" said Ed
Faberman, executive director of the Air Carrier Assn., an advocacy
group for smaller airlines. "All of the sudden there is a carrier
offering competition and choice and they don't want that
competition."</TE>
<TE>   The New York-based JetBlue offers three daily nonstop flights from
Long Beach to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
company plans to add another flight to New York in June and two
flights to Washington, D.C., in May.</TE>
<TE>   The upstart sets itself apart by offering leather seats and TV
screens, with 24 channels, in every seat back. It also offers low
fares on its fleet of new blue and white Airbus A320s and
aggressively markets its service, even going so far last summer as to
hand out bumper stickers that read "Goodbye, LAX" at beaches.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue agreed to come to Long Beach last spring after months of
secret negotiations with Long Beach officials, who desperately wanted
a low-fare airline at the underused airport. The airline pays
$120,000 every 90 days to hold the 24 time slots that it has not yet
filled with flights.</TE>
<TE>   David Neeleman, JetBlue's chief executive, said in a statement
Monday that the carrier "is on schedule to utilize the 27 air carrier
slots it was allocated by next spring," but declined to respond
directly to the other airlines' actions.</TE>
<TE>   Other carriers denied that their interest in Long Beach stems from
JetBlue's success, or that they are trying to block the airline's
expansion bid.</TE>
<TE>   American wants more flights to New York because it is expanding
its overall service from JFK, where the carrier is building a
$1.3-billion terminal, Becker said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Alaska Airlines, its ability to expand in recent months has
been crimped by capacity constraints at other airports, "and we
believe there's growth potential at Long Beach Airport," said Lou
Cancelmi, an Alaska spokesman. He said the carrier is "hopeful that
we're going to get the [time] slots" to start service from Long Beach
to Seattle on Sept. 8.</TE>
<TE>   City administrators said they are unsure how American Airlines can
confidently advertise additional service from Long Beach to its
customers when they do not yet have dedicated time slots.</TE>
<TE>   "The other airlines see that JetBlue is very successful and has a
very good load factor and now they want slots," said Long Beach City
Councilwoman Jackie Kell, whose district includes the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Selling tickets may or may not get them anywhere, because those
slots haven't been given to them," Kell said. "The consumer can't be
sure they will have a seat."</TE>

<HD>Abuse Investigation at Azusa Church</HD>

<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating complaints
that youths at St. Frances of Rome Catholic Church in Azusa were
molested by an adult. Authorities have interviewed more than a dozen
altar boys.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations were brought to the attention of detectives by the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles after it received a tip on
its hotline for sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives said their investigation led to conversations with
alleged victims. But they declined to name the suspect, the number of
victims, or which of the clergy and staff had been interviewed,
saying only that the suspect is an adult associated with the church.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. Ron Waltman of the Sheriff's Family Crimes Bureau said church
officials are cooperating with the investigation. "This is not going
to be a protracted investigation. We're going to resolve this
quickly, so that this cloud does not hang over the parish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Waltman said children at the church and adjacent school are safe.
"We have no information that the offending party is at that church
now," he said. Father Roque Fernandez, associate pastor, declined to
comment on the probe Monday and referred questions to the
archdiocese. He said the pastor, Father David F. Granadino, was
unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, archdiocese spokesman, said, "The archdiocese is
cooperating with the sheriff's detectives, and they've asked we refer
all questions to them."</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, without naming the parish, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
said at a news conference that the archdiocese had turned over
information from the hotline to the Sheriff's Department about an
alleged incident of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The news conference followed a Mass where Mahony apologized for
"the sinful and deplorable actions of a small percentage of priests"
and said he had adopted a zero-tolerance policy for child abusers.</TE>
<TE>   In investigating the Azusa complaint, Waltman said, sheriff's
detectives on one evening last week swept across the San Gabriel
Valley city and simultaneously interviewed altar boys and other
youths about the allegations. "We tried to speak to as many people as
we could so they could not discuss it with each other," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews will continue this week, Waltman said. There are about
75 altar "servers" at the church, the majority being boys in grades 5
through 8. About 200 families attend St. Frances, and 300 children
attend the K-8 school.</TE>
<TE>   One parishioner, Joe Rocha, an Azusa city councilman, said the
probe was not mentioned during church services over the weekend.
"Most of the parishioners are aware of the investigation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese hotline on sexual abuse was established in August.
It was one of 11 items required of the Los Angeles and Orange
archdioceses in settling a $5.2-million lawsuit last year over sexual
molestation charges involving an Orange County priest and one of his
high school students.</TE>

<HD>Man Who Kills Neighbor After Noise Dispute Fatally Wounded</HD>
<DH>Crime: He ambushes victim at their San Clemente apartments
and is hit as well, perhaps from a ricochet. Note said a second,
unrelated killing was planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Clemente man on Monday shot and killed a downstairs neighbor
who for weeks had complained about loud noise and music coming from
his apartment, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, Jaroslav Liska, 47, was gunned down in the apartment
carport around 9 a.m., shortly after witnesses heard shouting.
Moments later, the suspect, Peter Mehran, 25, also died--suffering a
fatal head wound that police said may have been caused by a ricochet
from his own semiautomatic pistol.</LD>
<LD>   Police also found a handwritten note inside Mehran's car
describing plans for a second, unrelated murder--including details
about how he would change his physical appearance and dispose of the
evidence after the attack, Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim
Amormino said. Neighbors in the community, a few blocks from the
beach, expressed shock at how a routine feud between two neighbors
could turn into a shooting rampage with at least a dozen rounds
fired.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe," said Jerry Anderson, who owns the
building. "Maybe it was [as simple as] noise from walking around ...
that was upsetting to [the] bottom unit."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors heard shouting and then gunfire outside the Baha Park
Apartments, at 3204 Avenida del Presidente in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police Mehran was waiting for the victim in the
carport.</TE>
<TE>   Liska's girlfriend and at least one other neighbor witnessed the
shooting, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth, and I heard
pop-pop-pop-pop!--about 12 shots," said Donald Morin, 36, a personal
trainer who lives in the apartments next door.</TE>
<TE>   Morin said he saw the gunman firing wildly from beneath the
carport's cement overhang.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was shooting at random: He was shooting toward
the right and shooting to the left, like he was mad. Then he shot one
up in the air," Morin said. "He shot up right in the air. The
carport's overhang was right above him. It looked like it ricocheted
and hit him."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are still trying to determine whether the gunman
turned the gun on himself or was killed by a stray bullet, Amormino
said. Police initially suspected suicide, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Liska, dressed in gray shorts and a windbreaker, was found lying
face down in the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   A small grocery bag was next to him.</TE>
<TE>   His body remained there, uncovered, until the early afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Because of fears there might be a second gunman, police cordoned
off the block and a sheriff's SWAT unit swept through the apartment
complex, igniting a flash grenade in the gunman's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing suspicious was found, and police believe Mehran acted
alone.</TE>
<TE>   The playground at Concordia Elementary School is just yards from
the area where the shooting occurred, but the school was empty Monday
because of spring break.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment building's owner, who does not live at the complex,
said the suspect had lived there for about two months and had never
caused trouble. The victim made complaints about noise from the
apartment above him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very good tenants. This is shocking. It's ... quiet and
peaceful here," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Takemiya, who lives in the building where the shooting
occurred, said Mehran was an "odd guy" who once got very angry at him
when he mistakenly pulled his car in the gunman's parking spot.</TE>
<TE>   "He scowled at me every time he saw me after that," Takemiya said
Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Marisa Hidalgo, whose third-story apartment overlooks the carport
area, said her three young children were in the living room watching
cartoons when the gunfire erupted.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard really loud yelling, a few insults and curse words, and
three or four seconds later I hear pop-pop-pop! Then a three-second
space, then another round of bullets," Hidalgo said. "After the first
pop, I dropped my kids to the floor and covered them."</TE>

<HD>Is Afghan Orphan Appeal Genuine?</HD>
<DH>Families: Hundreds respond as homes are sought in what
official observers fear is a hoax.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of people from California have started applying to become
foster parents in response to an e-mail seeking homes for more than
500 Afghan children and women, despite strong suggestions from Afghan
and U.S. officials that the drive behind it is fraudulent.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one has seen the children, more than 350 hopeful
prospective parents, most of them Afghans, turned up at meetings in
Garden Grove, Granada Hills and San Jose over the weekend to learn
more and sign up for foster care licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly as many Afghan women as children need homes, according to
the appeal.</LD>
<TE>   An organization that helped sponsor the meetings says so many
people have contacted it asking about the purported children that
additional sessions are being scheduled in San Diego, San Francisco
and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Assadullah Kadir, 51, and his wife, Suhaila, residents of Walnut,
were among those who started the foster parent process. The couple
have an appointment today to be fingerprinted as part of a background
check.</TE>
<TE>   After 21 years of marriage and two miscarriages, the Kadirs remain
childless. When they heard about orphans needing homes, they believed
it was the perfect solution: They would finally have a child, and the
orphan would gain a home and a family who understands the culture,
religion and language of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to do as much as I can to help these kids," the husband
said. "The last two weeks, almost every day, four to five hours I am
on the phone trying to track these kids. I'm sure we'll find them and
I try to be prepared for this situation ... so that as soon as they
are brought here, my house will be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Kadir and others like him, the story of the
Afghan children may be no more than a hoax, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigations from both the embassy side as well as the
investigations done by the U.S. government and FBI have turned up no
verifiable truth that orphans from Afghanistan were brought to the
United States," said the Afghan Embassy's humanitarian aid officer,
Homeyra Mokhtarzada.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact they were brought over, it counts as
human trafficking. It is illegal.... If this is for real, then please
bring a child into the public so that people can see them and we can
go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Several agencies--from the Los Angeles County Department of
Children and Family Services to the FBI to the Joint Council on
International Adoption Services--reported getting numerous calls in
recent days. Agency officials said they fear the Afghan American
community is the victim of a scam.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very concerned that good Muslim families will have either
their hearts broken or their wallets emptied," said Sharon A.
Kaufman, executive director of the Joint Council. So far, there is no
indication that responding families have been asked to put up money.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials, who asked not to be quoted directly,
said they can find no documentation of large groups of Afghan
children, and that international adoptions require considerable
paperwork. Adoptions are not typically allowed during or just after a
war because a child's parents may have been displaced by fighting but
later reappear, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, two meetings about the reportedly available
orphans were sponsored by NISWA, a Los Angeles-based Muslim social
services agency. The agency signed up more than 120 prospective
foster parents at the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   NISWA officials say they hope the accounts of children being
brought to the United States are true, which is why they have
scheduled the additional sessions in more cities this month. But they
also said they are frustrated by their inability to confirm the
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The problems began in mid-March when a NISWA representative and
several other Afghans attended a meeting at a Van Nuys church. At
that meeting, a woman who identified herself as Julie Fahrer and said
she belongs to an organization called International Resources told
the group she is a Lutheran minister working with military officials
to bring children to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She said the children were flown to Los Angeles under cover of
night and sheltered at a church, and some were later placed in homes.</TE>
<TE>   She distributed handwritten notes
describing orphans--heartbreaking details such as "triple amputee,"
"hoards food," and "frequent crying episodes two to three hours."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Saturday, Fahrer declined to provide any details
about herself, International Resources or the purported children, and
referred calls to the FBI and the Culver City Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very classified information. I cannot talk to you," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several people at the weekend meetings said they had seen a Web
site by a group that reports starting churches in urban areas around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The site includes a biography of a Julie Fahrer of International
Resources, which states that Fahrer has worked with refugees from
Sudan, Somalia, Romania, Kosovo and Kurdistan. The site's assertions
could not be verified.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Fahrer filed a report with Culver City police saying
she received about 10 threatening phone calls from people she
believed were angry because she was placing Muslim children in
Christian foster homes, according to city police Lt. Dave Tankenson.</TE>
<TE>   Fahrer told Culver City police that she receives Afghan refugee
children directly from flights and temporarily houses them. She did
not disclose the children's location to police but said they were not
at her home.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammad Daoud Abedi, 41, of Calabasas said Fahrer seemed genuine
when he met her, but since the March 16 meeting she has refused to
offer any proof.</TE>
<TE>   Abedi put out the initial e-mail after meeting Fahrer and has been
swamped with about 500 phone calls, e-mails and faxes each day from
people as far away as Saudi Arabia wanting to house the children.
After two weeks of investigating and alerting public officials, he
still has no answers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been frustrated," Abedi said. "I've been crying. My children
have been crying. My Afghan and Muslim people are crying. They're all
sad. They want to know the truth."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Orphan Appeal a Hoax?</HD>
<DH>Families: Many apply in Garden Grove and elsewhere to take
in kids purportedly brought to U.S. under odd circumstances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of people across California have started applying to become
foster parents in response to an e-mail seeking homes for more than
500 Afghan children and women despite strong suggestions from Afghan
and U.S. officials that the drive behind it is fraudulent.</LD>
<LD>   Although no one has seen the children, more than 350 hopeful
prospective parents, most of them Afghans, turned up at meetings in
Garden Grove, Granada Hills and San Jose over the weekend to learn
more and sign up for foster care licenses.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly as many Afghan women as children need homes, according to
the appeal.</LD>
<TE>   An organization that helped sponsor the meetings says so many
people have contacted it asking about the purported children that
further sessions are being scheduled in San Diego, San Francisco and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Assadullah Kadir, 51, and his wife, Suhaila, residents of Walnut,
were among those who started the foster parent process. The couple
have an appointment today to be fingerprinted as part of a background
check.</TE>
<TE>   After 21 years of marriage and two miscarriages, the Kadirs remain
childless. When they heard about orphans needing homes, they believed
it was the perfect solution: They would finally have a child, and the
orphan would gain a home and a family who understands the culture,
religion and language of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to do as much as I can to help these kids," the husband
said. "The last two weeks, almost every day, four to five hours I am
on the phone trying to track these kids. I'm sure we'll find them and
I try to be prepared for this situation ... so that as soon as they
are brought here, my house will be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Kadir and others like him, the story of the
Afghan children may be no more than a hoax, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigations from both the embassy side as well as the
investigations done by the U.S. government and FBI have turned up no
verifiable truth that orphans from Afghanistan were brought to the
United States," said the Afghan Embassy's humanitarian aid officer,
Homeyra Mokhtarzada.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact they were brought over, it counts as
human trafficking. It is illegal.... If this is for real, then please
bring a child into the public so that people can see them and we can
go from there."</TE>
<TE>   Several agencies--from the Los Angeles County Department of
Children and Family Services to the FBI to the Joint Council on
International Adoption Services--reported getting numerous calls
about the matter in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials said they fear the Afghan American community is
the victim of a scam.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very concerned that good Muslim families will have either
their hearts broken or their wallets emptied," said Sharon A.
Kaufman, executive director of the Joint Council. So far, there is no
indication that responding families have been asked to put up money.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials, who asked not to be quoted directly,
said they can find no documentation about large groups of Afghan
children, and that international adoptions require considerable
paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   Adoptions are not typically allowed during or just after a war
because a child's parents may have been displaced by fighting but
later reappear, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, two meetings about the reportedly available
orphans were sponsored by NISWA, a Los Angeles-based Muslim social
services agency. The agency signed up more than 120 prospective
foster parents at the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   NISWA officials say they hope the accounts of children being
brought to the United States are true, which is why they have
scheduled the additional sessions in more cities this month. But they
also said they are frustrated by their inability so far to confirm
the accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The problems began in mid-March when a NISWA representative and
several other Afghans attended a meeting at a Van Nuys church. At
that meeting, a woman who identified herself as Julie Fahrer and said
she belongs to an organization called International Resources told
the group she is a Lutheran minister working with military officials
to bring children to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She said the children were flown in to Los Angeles under cover of
night and sheltered at a church, and some were later placed in homes.</TE>
<TE>   She distributed handwritten notes
describing orphans--heartbreaking details such as "triple amputee,"
"hoards food," and "frequent crying episodes two to three hours."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Saturday, Fahrer declined to provide any details
about herself, International Resources or the purported children, and
referred calls to the FBI and the Culver City Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very classified information. I cannot talk to you," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several people at the weekend meetings said they had seen a Web
site by a group that reports starting churches in urban areas around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The site includes a biography of a Julie Fahrer of International
Resources, which states that Fahrer has worked with refugees from
Sudan, Somalia, Romania, Kosovo and Kurdistan. The site's assertions
could not be verified.</TE>

<HD>Driver Hurt in Crash on Ortega Highway</HD>
<DH>Accident: He is cut from his car. Multiple collision ties
up traffic for about an hour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rescuers freed a motorist from his car Monday after it struck a
big-rig truck and a pickup truck and sent the pickup into a ravine
off Ortega Highway just east of San Juan Capistrano, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The 36-year-old man, whose name was not released immediately, was
westbound in a Nissan Sentra when the noontime accident occurred 3.5
miles outside the city limits, said Sgt. Greg Saulman, a spokesman
for the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   Traffic on the two-lane highway was tied up for about an hour.</LD>
<TE>   Saulman said the Nissan drifted three feet over the center line
and struck the truck's left front bumper. The impact spun the car,
and it struck a pickup truck traveling behind the big rig, sending it
into a ravine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Nissan's driver suffered a broken leg, facial lacerations and
chest contusions and was freed with the Jaws of Life, Saulman said.
He was airlifted to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in
Mission Viejo for treatment. His condition was not available Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   There were no other injuries.</TE>

<HD>Review of Parks Will Be Private</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Citing the need to discuss some sensitive personnel
matters, Police Commission decides to interview the chief in closed
meetings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a request by Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks to
open to the public his crucial interview for a second five-year term,
city Police Commission members opted Monday to conduct a lengthy
meeting with the chief in private.</LD>
<LD>   Explaining their decision through Commission Executive Director
Joe Gunn, commission members said they wanted to protect information
about sensitive officer-involved shootings, disciplinary procedures
and personnel matters involving people other than Parks that might be
raised during the discussion.</LD>
<LD>   The decision prompted an angry outcry from a crowd of about two
dozen Parks supporters who had gathered in an auditorium of LAPD
headquarters at Parker Center in hopes of hearing him publicly defend
his record and spell out his vision for a second term.</LD>
<TE>   "We are talking about violating certain people's rights, but what
about the public's rights?" asked Danny Bakewell, head of the
Brotherhood Crusade, who found himself under the television lights as
Gunn slipped away from the podium.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, the chief, appearing somewhat more serious and
preoccupied than usual, walked down a long hallway to meet with
commissioners in private.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the doors closed, City Councilman Nate Holden
released what he said was the chief's prepared response to the
commission's queries.</TE>
<TE>   The inch-thick report, titled "Chief of Police Reappointment
Criteria--Response by Bernard C. Parks" and dated Monday, lays out in
detail the changes during his five years heading the department.</TE>
<TE>   Written in the impersonal, bureaucratic style that characterizes
many LAPD reports, the document has 14 sections, and addresses each
of the commission's criteria in turn, and presents a grocery list of
internal LAPD programs and procedures explaining how they were
established or expanded under Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The report placed little emphasis on the chief personally, instead
talking of the department as a whole. It lays out, for example,
Parks' efforts to reorganize the LAPD to reduce bureaucratic layers,
the reorganization of the former CRASH anti-gang units into new gang
units with different training, and the establishment of a command
accountability program to fight crime in which captains are asked to
answer for specific crime problems in their areas.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member Police Commission is empowered to decide, subject
to a City Council override, whether Parks receives a second term.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is in the final stages of deciding Parks' fate, and
has scheduled additional closed sessions for today, Wednesday and
next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In its session Monday, the commission was due to hear the chief
address each of eight performance criteria on which members had said
they wanted to judge his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Those criteria are: vision and leadership; control and prevention
of crime; management; police reform; strategies for community
policing and programs; communications; personnel administration and
employee relations; and relations with the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   After about 41/2 hours, the commissioners emerged for a brief
break, and Parks called it "a very good meeting, a very good
meeting."</TE>
<TE>   He said his impression was that commissioners had not made up
their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso said that the session was going
"very well." The panel and the chief, he said, had been "going back
and forth and having a very open and frank discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the decision to keep the session closed, he said, "The
reality is that we are dealing with very sensitive information,"
including personnel and deployment issues ordinarily discussed in
closed session. "What's the option?" he asked. "To keep it in open
session and violate people's rights?"</TE>
<TE>   As the meeting broke up about 9:30 p.m., commissioners emerged to
announce they would continue interviewing the chief in closed session
today.</TE>
<TE>   "The meeting went well," Caruso said. "It was a good, open, honest
discussion." Parks "made a good presentation, a very honest appraisal
of his strengths and his weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso, who has said before that he is struggling with the
decision, said, "I still have very mixed emotions. I still am where I
was months ago. I'm still on the fence."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of whether Parks, the LAPD's 52nd chief and the second
African American, will serve another term has been fuel for political
fire since early February, when Mayor James K. Hahn announced he
opposed Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, Hahn's pronouncement only had the weight of an opinion,
because the city's charter assigns the job of reappointing the chief
to the commissioners, who are appointed by the mayor, but are
empowered to act independently in overseeing the police department.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the mayor's early entry into the fray enraged supporters of
the chief, including a number of prominent African American clergy
and politicians, even as it gratified Parks' opponents, such as the
Police Protective League, the union representing rank-and-file
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, Parks had written a letter to the commission
asking that Monday's session, which had been designated for him to
give a lengthy defense of his performance, be opened to the public.
Through a spokesman, he said that a number of people had asked to
hear his statement to the commission, and that he was responding to
those requests.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the request drew a guardedly favorable response from
Caruso, although he said the request would have to pass muster with
other commissioners and the city attorney's office before it could be
approved. Caruso also voiced concern that the commissioners be
allowed to conduct some discussion in private.</TE>
<TE>   A city attorney's spokeswoman initially said that, in general, the
law would not prohibit an open interview.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday, Asst. City Atty. Patricia Tubert said that
commissioners had asked whether they could query the chief on
personnel matters involving others and pending litigation during an
open session. She said no.</TE>
<TE>   "Those matters need to be closed session; there are privacy rights
involved," she said, adding: "The commission has the option of having
the matter in closed session so they can have a candid and open
discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners did not appear in public Monday afternoon, instead
leaving it to Gunn to explain to the gathered crowd that, "while the
board is sensitive to the chief's request, a lot of issues came
up.... The commissioners have a lot of questions, and if it's an open
session, the board will be unable to ask those questions."</TE>
<TE>   Present at the hearing were members of Parks' family. They, too,
were closed out of the session, and headed to dinner while the chief
was being interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' wife, Bobbi, told reporters she was surprised that the
meeting was closed, and said she felt the commission should conduct
her husband's review the same way the City Council conducts most
public business.</TE>
<TE>   As the political furor over the chief has roiled, commissioners
have steadfastly insisted that they will not be influenced by
political pressure, and will decide the chief's case on its merits.</TE>

protected. Plaintiff had seen pastor for marriage counseling.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange pastor accused of making sexual advances to a woman who
turned to him for marriage counseling cannot be sued in civil court
because he is not a licensed counselor, a California appellate court
ruled.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, released Friday, affirms a state law that exempts
the clergy from civil lawsuits involving advice they give to those
who seek their counsel. The law was intended to encourage people to
confide in the clergy in a setting not bound by codes of professional
conduct.</LD>
<LD>   The case centers on Orlando Barela, a pastor at the Household of
Faith Family Church. Barela is a well-known figure in Orange because
he escaped gang life to become a Christian leader.</LD>
<TE>   The woman, whose name is not contained in court records, said she
and her husband were members of the church for about a year when they
sought Barela's help for their troubled marriage.</TE>
<TE>   She alleged in her lawsuit that Barela expressed a sexual interest
in her during several sessions--but only after sending her husband
out of the room.</TE>
<TE>   Once they were alone, the woman claimed, the pastor hugged, kissed
and fondled her and boasted he could please her more than her
husband.</TE>
<TE>   Barela strongly denies the accusations, though he declined through
his attorney to comment on the case Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she complained about Barela's behavior but was told
by church elders to leave the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband ultimately divorced, and she sued the church
and the pastor for negligence, emotional distress, sexual harassment
and sexual battery. The 4th District Court of Appeal did not render a
decision on the woman's accusations. But even if events occurred as
she said, the court concluded that her claims did not amount to
sexual harassment. "He hugged and kissed her.... She 'half-resisted'
by putting her hand on his chest," the opinion stated. "She told him
she was afraid they would be caught."</TE>
<TE>   Such conduct on the part of a licensed marriage counselor or
therapist would violate state law, the court said. But state law
exempts the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "Morally reprehensible as Orlando's advances [would be] under the
subterfuge of marital counseling, his status as a pastor/counselor
does not, under the law, bestow upon him any duty beyond that of the
ordinary lay person," the court wrote in its opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Michael A. Byrne, lawyer for the church, said Barela and church
officials were pleased by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long and difficult trial for both sides," Byrne said.
"The pastor and his wife were very pleased to hear the news."</TE>
<TE>   The woman's lawyer, Philip DeLuca, said he might appeal the
decision to the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "What it's doing is holding this religious leader in a preferred
position in our society," DeLuca said.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Ray Bradbury, before being honored with the 2,193rd
star Monday on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is amused by a fan. The
ceremony for the author, 81, an L.A. resident since he was a
teenager, kicked off a monthlong reading campaign in the city during
which residents are urged to read Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451." "It is
a wonderful feeling to be a permanent part of my hometown," he said.</CP>

<HD>Farm Workers Celebrate Safety Law, Chavez Holiday</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Farm workers and union leaders Monday marked the 75th anniversary of
the birth of Cesar Chavez by celebrating a new state law that
requires seats in agricultural labor vans to be firmly secured and
outlaws rickety wood benches.</LD>
<LD>   Flanked by a squad of Highway Patrol officers who specialize in
enforcing agricultural transportation laws in the sprawling San
Joaquin Valley, United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez said
the new law is a legacy of Chavez's efforts to make transportation
safer for farm workers.</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez quoted the late farm labor leader as writing in 1974
that unsafe vehicles were "wheeled coffins ... carriages of death and
sorrow" for farm laborers.</LD>
<TE>   "Today, 28 years after Cesar wrote those words, there is finally a
law in effect that bans these 'wheeled coffins,'" Rodriguez told a
small gathering of farm workers in Capitol Park.</TE>
<TE>   The law, introduced by Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), was
passed in 1999 following a crash in which 13 farm laborers stuffed
into a van without seat belts plowed into a big truck near Five
Points in Fresno County.</TE>
<TE>   The crash brought new attention from the Legislature and Gov. Gray
Davis to highway safety issues of agricultural workers and led to
several reforms, including a requirement that all farm labor vans be
equipped with seat belts.</TE>
<TE>   But Florez said some labor contractors found a loophole that has
enabled them to install seat belts in the vans but not replace the
long wood benches and little chairs on which the workers sat.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, effective Monday, wood seats are banned. All
seats must now be secured in the same way that vehicle manufacturers
fasten them and must face forward. Farm tools also must be secured.</TE>
<TE>   "For too many years we have seen farm worker deaths as part of the
harvest," Florez said.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, farm workers have complained that labor contractors
and growers have ignored their pleas to make transportation safer.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Davis and the Legislature beefed up the Highway Patrol's
special enforcement unit of a dozen officers in the San Joaquin
Valley. But Florez said Monday that extra enforcement should be
expanded to other farm areas, including the Imperial, Coachella, and
Sacramento valleys and the Central Coast.</TE>
<TE>   He is carrying a bill to do that and is sponsoring changes in the
state budget that would give the patrol an extra $3 million to $6
million to finance such an expansion, including hiring at least 20
officers. Davis rejected a similar appropriation in 2000 and is
facing a $17.5-billion budget shortfall this year.</TE>

<HD>Law Stands Limiting Gifts to Officials</HD>
<DH>Santa Monica: Citing procedural grounds, judge dismisses a
challenge to measure approved by voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit challenging a voter-approved measure
in Santa Monica that would limit the gifts elected officials can
receive from companies that have done business with the city.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Debra Yang did not rule on
the constitutionality of Proposition LL, passed by Santa Monica
voters in November 2000. Instead, she set aside the lawsuit on
procedural grounds.</LD>
<LD>   She left the door open for future challenges, but it was unclear
whether the city would continue its legal fight or allow the law to
take effect. Voters in Pasadena, Claremont and San Francisco passed
similar initiatives in recent years promoted by the Oaks Project, a
Santa Monica-based organizing branch of Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights.</LD>
<TE>   Of the four, only San Francisco is enforcing the proposition,
which bars elected officials from accepting gifts, jobs or campaign
donations from anyone to whom they awarded a "public benefit" within
five years of a vote or one year of leaving office.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen Balber, Oaks Project director, said the law would prevent
Enron-style relationships from developing between elected officials
and private companies. Elected officials would be required to
provide--to anyone upon request--a list of their yes votes on city
contracts, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the initiative, however, said the bill is vague and
unjustly restricts the rights of elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   "These things can just be a ruse to strip the rights from some
citizens and amplify the voices of others," said John Ramirez, an
attorney representing Santa Monica City Clerk Maria Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Laws must be applied evenhandedly, he said, and it is unfair to
impose limits only on those who vote in favor of a contract. It's
conceivable, he said, that an official could benefit from denying a
contract, and the law does not take such instances into account.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain a clarification of the law, Santa Monica took what, to
an outsider, might appear an unusual step--it filed suit in June 2001
against its own city clerk.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, said Mayor Michael Feinstein, said that Stewart chose
not to enforce the law because she believed it to be
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Such "contrived lawsuits"--filed to obtain validation on legal
grounds by a judge--are a "recognized method" of testing certain laws
and have been filed since 1935, Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   After Santa Monica sued Stewart, the Oaks Project filed its own
motion, asking the judge to dismiss the city's suit. Yang allowed the
Oaks Project to act as intercessors in the case because it was
involved in placing Proposition LL on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling, Yang said the city's suit had no merit because
Proposition LL was aimed at office-holders, not the city clerk, and
did not directly affect her duties. "There is nothing in the language
of the initiative that can reasonably be construed as requiring
Defendant Stewart to act as a monitor or enforcer over the city
officials to whom the initiative pertains," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Balber said the judge recognized that the city's method of
attacking the measure lacked merit. "The posture of the case had been
pretty farcical," she said. "Because the city was on both sides of
the case, we didn't feel there would be an adequate defense."</TE>
<TE>   Yang did not rule out future legal challenges, but suggested they
be filed by other parties.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said the City Council has not had the opportunity to
meet in closed session yet to decide whether to appeal.</TE>

<HD>Doubt Is Cast on Valley Reserves</HD>
<DH>Secession: But state controller rejects L.A.'s claim it
would be owed $300 million annually, and says harbor region not a
viable city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The harbor area of Los Angeles could not survive as a separate city,
and the San Fernando Valley would have to beef up its reserves to be
fiscally healthy, state Controller Kathleen Connell ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Connell, who was asked by Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn to
review proposals to split the two regions from Los Angeles, rejected
the city's contention that a new Valley city would owe it nearly $300
million annually.</LD>
<LD>   Secession advocates said Connell's findings bolster their case by
removing one argument against it--the contention that the breakaway
area would be financially constrained because it would be obligated
to continue pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the city of
Los Angeles budget.</LD>
<TE>   Some secession critics have said those payments would be needed to
ensure that Los Angeles would not be hurt financially by the breakup,
a condition that must be met before secession can be placed on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Connell's study says that rather than $300 million a year, the
Valley would owe Los Angeles about $61 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major victory," said Richard Close, president of Valley
VOTE, the group leading the drive to place Valley secession on the
ballot. "It removes the last potential roadblock to this going on the
November ballot."</TE>
<TE>   The controller's finding that a proposed harbor city would not be
able to operate in the black could be enough to knock the proposal
off the ballot--particularly because the state agency that oversees
the creation of new cities has also pointed out serious flaws in the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits such a vote unless the area that would secede
is shown to be financially viable.</TE>
<TE>   But votes on independence for the Valley and Hollywood look more
likely after Monday's reports.</TE>
<TE>   The controller supported the analysis and methodology used by the
Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees the creation of new
cities.</TE>
<TE>   And that would indicate that when she analyzes the Hollywood
proposal, she will again support the commission's finding that the
area would be financially healthy on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council is expected Wednesday to ask her to conduct a
similar review of a secession proposal for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The harbor is climbing a steep mountain at high altitude without
an oxygen tank, but my expectation is that Hollywood will make it [to
the ballot]," said county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who serves on
the commission and chairs the committee working out the details of
the proposed municipal splits.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of secession in the harbor, Hollywood and Valley,
driven by the belief that Los Angeles is too big and impersonal, have
asked that their proposals to break up the city be placed on the
ballot in the fall. Critics argue that the breakup would prove
unwieldy and have cited logistical, political and moral objections.</TE>
<TE>   Connell wrote her report in response to Hahn's request to analyze
the soundness of a state commission's contention that a proposed
Valley city would be economically healthy, and that a harbor city
would have financial problems unless it significantly reduced
services or raised taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In her review, the controller said that the proposed harbor city
would not be able to make ends meet even if the State Lands
Commission, which she chairs, grants it full control over the Port of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Even under the best-case scenario for the harbor, we don't
believe that cityhood is a viable answer," Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who represents the
harbor area and is the mayor's sister, said that in order to survive
financially, an independent city would have to cut into the most
important services, such as police and fire.</TE>
<TE>   She criticized secession supporters, who say that independence
will make the densely packed blue-collar and middle-class
neighborhoods of San Pedro, Wilmington and Harbor City work and feel
like a small town.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants Small Town U.S.A. when Small Town U.S.A. could burn
down or criminals could take over?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mardesich, co-chairman of the harbor secession effort, said
that both the controller and the commission improperly analyzed their
proposal as if a harbor city would be run like Los Angeles, rather
than like a much smaller city.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the same thing [as Connell] based on the numbers she
saw," Mardesich said. "She never saw our alternative scenario."</TE>
<TE>   Connell said she could not directly address the question of
whether the Valley would be financially viable on its own, because
Hahn did not ask her to do so. Connell, who ran against Hahn for
mayor of Los Angeles last year, said she believed the omission was
deliberate because Hahn feared that she would rule that a Valley city
could be financially healthy without Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the controller said she was concerned that the proposed
Valley city, which would have a population of 1.4 million, would have
smaller reserves than most California cities of comparable size.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city would have a sizable budget, its proposed
reserve fund of $12 million during its third year of independence is
significantly less than the $35 million that cities of comparable
size generally have, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Connell recommended that supporters of Valley cityhood remedy that
by cutting $23 million from their proposed $1-billion budget or risk
"gasping for air" if unexpected expenditures arise.</TE>
<TE>   Connell also found that the commission underestimated by about $4
million the amount of money a Valley city would have to pay yearly
for its share of Los Angeles' debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I would caution Valley proponents to really look with great
discipline at this budget and determine where they would want to make
these cutbacks," she said in an interview Monday. "They're going to
want to walk into cityhood with the element of success, and they can
only do that if they put together a budget that provides for some
kind of cushion."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hahn said that because the report pointed out financial
flaws in both proposals, it showed that people would be better off if
the city stayed together. "The idea that there's this utopia around
the bend that's going to have all this money to provide all these
extra services ... is a myth," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to respond in detail to the report Monday.</TE>

<HD>SPCA Lawsuit Accuses Ex-Executive of Theft</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals is trying to recover nearly $1 million that officials say
was embezzled by its chief financial officer, according to a suit
filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that Kenneth Brookwell, who served as the
nonprofit agency's vice president from August 1999 until he went on a
disability leave in July 2001, took $928,352 from a retirement fund.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Police Department's financial crimes division is
investigating the missing funds, Officer Eduardo Funes, a police
spokesman, said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Madeline Bernstein, president of the Los Angeles SPCA chapter,
said the loss will not affect any retirees or result in cutbacks in
society programs because much of the money was left over from a
retirement plan being closed out after participants had been paid
what they were owed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed and heartbroken and dismayed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Brookwell declined to comment and referred questions to his
lawyer, Robert Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   "My client maintains his innocence," Bernstein said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Brookwell joined the SPCA in January 1996 as its controller. He
was promoted in August 1998 to senior director of finance and to vice
president and chief financial officer a year later, according to the
suit filed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He took a disability leave on July 13, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Brookwell was the trustee of an account set up to distribute
pension funds to participants of the discontinued retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   Any money left over from those distributions was to be deposited
in the society's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that he took the money when he "wrongfully issued
at least 74 checks from the Retirement Plan Account to himself, his
banks, his credit card companies, and even construction and design
companies apparently involved in the building of his home" in Rancho
Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Brookwell intercepted unexpected revenues such as
bequests, deposited them into the discontinued retirement account and
then drew the money for personal uses.</TE>
<TE>   In the suit, the SPCA also accuses Brookwell of issuing checks to
retirement plan participants, endorsing them with his own name and
depositing them into his bank account.</TE>

<HD>Barry Took, 73; British Comic, 'Monty Python' and
'Laugh-In' Writer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Took, the British stand-up comedian and comedy writer who
helped produce such zany shows as "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and
lent his talents to the much-loved American television classic "Rowan
and Martin's Laugh-In," has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Took, often called one of the funniest men in Britain, died Sunday
in a London nursing home of cancer. He had suffered a stroke nearly
two years ago, which impaired his speech and his storied ability to
write.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps best-known for his post-World War II radio scripts, Took
was responsible for such celebrated BBC series as "Round the Horne,"
"The Army Game," "Educating Archie" and "Bootsie and Snudge." The
shows helped Britain cope with decades of austerity and its
diminished role in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Ever-employable in Britain, Took rarely worked in American
entertainment productions. "Laugh-In" was a popular exception. The
show, which flourished from 1968 to 1973, relied on witty writers,
including Took, who could spew out one-liners and devise sight gags,
blackouts, sketches and catch phrases.</TE>
<TE>   Born in London, Took had an outwardly laugh-a-minute life that was
clouded by depression and self-doubt rooted in an unhappy childhood.
He once said his mother, who doted on his older brother, told him
that his birth was unplanned, that he was not wanted and that the
cost of rearing him had made his father have a nervous breakdown.
Took underwent years of Freudian psychoanalysis to help overcome his
problems.</TE>
<TE>   He left school at age 15, worked as an office boy and film
projectionist, and then joined the Royal Air Force, where he began
working in entertainment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Took went on to work as a stagehand and stand-up comedian, and in
1957 teamed with Marty Feldman to create and write several successful
radio shows. The comedy writing team was fast and prolific, turning
out four or five shows a week.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed Baron von Took by a television executive, Took helped
create and foster a show originally called "Baron von Took's Flying
Circus." That evolved into the hugely popular "Monty Python's Flying
Circus."</TE>
<TE>   Twice divorced, Took is survived by two sons, Barry and David, and
two daughters, Susan and Elinor.</TE>
<TE>   Always candid about his cancer, which began a few years ago with
bladder cancer, Took frequently quipped, "It doesn't worry me.
Everyone has to get ill and die."</TE>
<TE>   But the stroke saddened him. "You realize," he said in late 2000,
"however hard you try, that you cannot write, you cannot talk
properly and you feel like a damn nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to be remembered," he added in that interview, "as 'the
guy who was rather talented once upon a time.'"</TE>

<HD>Court Orders Retroactive Payments for Ill Veterans</HD>
<DH>Ruling: The appeals panel's decision applies to thousands
who have prostate cancer or diabetes and had been exposed to Agent
Orange in Vietnam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Department of Veterans
Affairs must pay retroactive disability payments to thousands of
Vietnam veterans suffering diabetes and prostate cancer after being
exposed to Agent Orange.</LD>
<LD>   The payments must date to when veterans initially applied for
benefits under a law that allowed them to do so beginning Sept. 25,
1985. Because of a complicated rule-making procedure, the government
said the cancer victims could not receive benefits until Nov. 7,
1996, if they filed a claim after Jan. 4, 1994.</LD>
<LD>   The appeals court nullified that government interpretation, which
affects about 1,200 veterans, said Barton F. Stichman, executive
director of the National Veterans Legal Services Program.</LD>
<TE>   Also undermined by the ruling was the government's position that
veterans suffering from adult onset diabetes could not get benefits
until July 9, 2001, if they filed a claim between Jan. 4, 1994, and
July 9, 2001, Stichman said.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you is for the last 20 years the VA has dragged
its feet on the Agent Orange issue. They try every way they can to
come up with theories to why they shouldn't give benefits," said
Stichman, who filed suit in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Budahn, a Veterans Affairs spokesman, said the government had
not seen the decision and could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   From 1962 to 1971, the United States sprayed 19 million gallons of
herbicides over southern Vietnam to destroy jungle cover for
Communist troops. About 55% of that was Agent Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the government has added a host of diseases
associated with Agent Orange entitling veterans to disability
benefits. Those include several cancers, including cancer of the
lung, larynx and trachea. Last year, the U.S. recognized adult onset
diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling puts prostate cancer and adult onset diabetes in line
with the other diseases acknowledged by the government to have links
to Agent Orange, meaning disability benefits would be paid from when
a claim was filed.</TE>
<TE>   For many veterans, the government has paid retroactive benefits as
litigation continued. The government reserved the right to take back
the benefits if it won the suit.</TE>

<HD>Freeways' Missing Links Can Frustrate Commuters</HD>
<DH>More than 50 connector ramps were never built at two dozen
major crossings in L.A., Orange counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Kriske is having a torrid on-again, off-again affair. With
freeways.</LD>
<LD>   Consider his daily commute from Burbank to Beverly Hills: Moments
after the 25-year-old database analyst zooms up a freeway onramp, he
is downshifting his Acura Integra and heading for an exit.</LD>
<LD>   Then Kriske chugs along a mile of city streets before ramping on
to another freeway. But before long, he's rushing for an offramp and
surface streets again. He'll repeat the process a third time before
his drive is over.</LD>
<TE>   It's not that Kriske is the waffling kind of guy who can't commit.
It's just that the three freeways that zigzag him toward work--the
Golden State south, the Ventura west and the Hollywood south--cross
each other but lack connecting ramps that funnel him in a direct,
unbroken arc.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating is what it is," Kriske said. "The fact that I
have to get off the freeway to get back on is an annoyance."</TE>
<TE>   The ups and downs of freeway driving are a way of life for many
motorists in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, at least 36 connectors are absent at 13
freeway intersections, while 11 freeway crossings in Orange County
may seem incomplete because 17 connector ramps were never built,
according to the California Department of Transportation. Nine
connectors are missing from San Diego County's freeways, though one
is under construction now.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the obvious inconvenience to drivers--not to mention
the nuisance of cut-through traffic in neighborhoods--some wonder
whether transportation engineers might have accidentally deleted
something from their construction blueprints.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see any rhyme or reason to it. It doesn't make any
sense," said Oliver Comings, 28, of Studio City, who said he has
gotten confused and lost many times when he couldn't turn from
freeway to freeway. "Somebody obviously dropped the ball."</TE>
<TE>   But transportation experts say missing freeway connectors aren't
mistakes or the result of bad engineering. "There's generally a very
good reason for it," said Chuck O'Connell, a freeway historian and
retired Caltrans deputy district director.</TE>
<TE>   A connector might be omitted if it involves an illogical "reverse
move," where the freeways cross at an acute angle, experts say. An
example is the northbound Long Beach Freeway to the southbound Santa
Ana Freeway in the City of Commerce. If a car cruising north on the
Long Beach Freeway wanted to turn south on the Santa Ana Freeway, it
would have to make the equivalent of a giant U-turn.</TE>
<TE>   Some freeway intersections huddle so close together they are
expected to share connectors. That describes the Ronald Reagan
Freeway, which intersects with the Golden State and San Diego
freeways about 1 1/2 miles apart. There is no connecting ramp from
the eastbound Ronald Reagan Freeway to the northbound Golden State
Freeway, for instance. That's because Caltrans wants drivers to
connect to the San Diego Freeway north, then immediately merge onto
the Golden State Freeway north.</TE>
<TE>   A third reason for absent connectors is insufficient traffic
volume. When the new California 56 extension in the Carmel Valley
area of San Diego County opens in 2004, the freeway will not have
connectors for cars going from California 56 west to the San Diego
Freeway south, or from the San Diego Freeway north to California 56
east. Despite the communities' urging, Caltrans is omitting those two
ramps because they would cost $140 million but serve only 1,000
vehicles a day, said Tom Nipper, an agency spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But freeways that remain unconnected also impose costs, experts
say. They waste drivers' time. Cut-through traffic worsens
congestion, increases air pollution and possibly causes more
accidents on city streets. These are "impacts that don't lend
themselves to easy quantification," said Robert W. Poole, director of
transportation studies at Reason Public Policy Institute in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the added noise.</TE>
<TE>   Comings, a singer with a heavy metal group, happens to live with
his bandmates near the Ventura and Hollywood freeways' interchange,
which lacks four connectors. There is no freeway-to-freeway access,
for example, from the Hollywood Freeway north to the Ventura Freeway
east.</TE>
<TE>   One of the designated detour streets for that missing connector is
Vineland Avenue, right next to Comings' house. "It's soooooooo loud,"
he said as a steady stream of cars and big rigs rumbled by. His band,
None, moved to the house a few months ago, figuring neighbors
wouldn't be able to hear their banging drums and screaming guitar
riffs over the roar of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the music situation, [the noise] would drive me
insane," Comings said. "It's brutal."</TE>
<TE>   The missing connectors in Studio City are a special case. In the
early 1950s, when the Hollywood Freeway was under construction,
designers deliberately put some ramp plans on hold until the adjacent
"Laurel Canyon Freeway" could be built because "all the connectors
would have logically tied in," said O'Connell, the freeway historian.</TE>
<TE>   But the Laurel Canyon Freeway, like hundreds of miles of other
freeways proposed for Los Angeles County, never got built. "So,
unfortunately, we're stuck," O'Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   Also feeling pinched are the residents near the Golden State and
Ventura freeways' interchange in the Glendale-Los Angeles area, who
say they're sick of cars cutting through their neighborhood because
the Ventura Freeway east does not connect with the Golden State
Freeway north, nor does the Golden State Freeway south with the
Ventura Freeway west.</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers speed as if they're still on the freeway, and that
endangers neighborhood children, said Maria Jesus Lara, a 53-year-old
grandmother. "It's bad," she said. "One day, maybe they'll fix it."</TE>
<TE>   Lara and others shouldn't hold their breath. Caltrans studied the
location and--by matching car license plates at two freeway
exits--found that only about 100 cars per hour were cutting through
the neighborhood during peak commute times. The agency concluded that
the volume was not heavy enough to justify the high cost of building
a new connector, said Tom Choe, Caltrans chief of freeway operations
for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Those who live in the area dispute those low figures. Hopes were
dashed when a different study--sponsored by Los Angeles, Glendale and
Burbank, which is also near the interchange--found it would be too
complicated, costly and disruptive to build the connectors anyway
because of the area's special geography. The connectors would have to
skirt the Los Angeles River and force the demolition of many homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps it would not be worth it," said Kriske, now resigned to
wishful thinking about smooth driving on freeways. Still, he said,
"it's a substandard way to navigate."</TE>

<HD>Judge Yang Nominated as L.A.'s U.S. Attorney</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWIEG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Superior Court Judge Debra W. Yang has been nominated by President
Bush to become U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, the White House said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Yang, 42, would become the first Asian American to hold the
seven-county post, the largest federal prosecutor's office outside
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Yang, a former federal prosecutor, said she hopes for a quick
Senate confirmation vote. No opposition is expected.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm anxious to get into the office and begin assessing what its
current needs are, and what changes need to be put into place," she
said. However, Yang added that she has no changes in mind at this
time.</TE>
<TE>   She estimated it would take her about two weeks to clear her
calendar at the Santa Monica courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Judiciary Committee has not scheduled a vote on the
nomination. A spokeswoman said the committee is awaiting documents
from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's nomination had been expected for several months. The White
House counsel's office recommended her to Bush last fall after
interviewing a short list of finalists--including Yang and two Los
Angeles attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Active in Republican Party affairs, the Los Angeles native was
chosen to succeed former U.S. Atty. Alejandro N. Mayorkas, a
Democrat, who resigned last April. The 245-lawyer office has been
headed on an interim basis by John S. Gordon, a career prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   With headquarters in Los Angeles and branches in Santa Ana and
Riverside, the U.S. Attorney's office prosecutes federal crimes in
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo,
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The office also represents the
Justice Department in civil-law suits.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, whose grandfather emigrated from China, has been active in
the Asian American Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Boston College Law School in 1985, she
practiced civil law for three years and then clerked with U.S.
District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los Angeles. Following another year
in private practice, she joined the U.S. Attorney's office in 1990
and prosecuted cases for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Praise for Handling of Kidnap-Rape Case</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have praised her for her 1994 prosecution of Timothy
D. Shue, a parolee who kidnapped a Castaic real estate agent at
gunpoint, forced her to withdraw cash from an ATM and then drove her
to Arizona, where he sexually assaulted her. Shue was convicted and
sentenced to 35 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   David Schindler, a former colleague in the U.S. Attorney's office,
said that in addition to her legal skills, Yang displayed rapport
with crime victims.</TE>
<TE>   She also was a favorite among federal law enforcement agents, he
said, because she understood and appreciated the dangers they
encountered on the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of this, Deb is going to be a tremendously successful
U.S. Attorney," Schindler said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Barry, a former federal public defender who represented Shue
in the kidnap-rape trial, recalled that Yang "was always professional
and friendly. She was a pleasure to work with, even though she was on
the other side. I think she's going to make a fine U.S. Attorney."</TE>
<TE>   Lew, her former mentor, said he was elated about Yang's
nomination: "She's certainly well qualified for this position and I
look forward to her speedy confirmation ...."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Patricia Donahue described Yang as tough but
fair, intelligent and excellent at assessing the strengths and
weaknesses of a case.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon offered his congratulations and said he and his staff
"intend to do our best to make the transition for her as smooth as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Yang left the U.S. Attorney's office in 1997 when Gov. Pete Wilson
appointed her to a Municipal Court judgeship in Los Angeles. When the
county's court system was unified in 2000, she became a Superior
Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   Yang was also in the running for a federal judgeship. A local
bipartisan selection committee headed by Gerald Parsky, who ran
Bush's presidential campaign in California, recommended Yang to the
White House by a 6-0 vote. But Yang indicated that she preferred the
U.S. Attorney's post.</TE>

<HD>Plans for Merced River in Yosemite Upheld</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Judge's decision clears the way for some key
projects, such as upgrading lodging, reducing parking and camping.
Park will get more visitors, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has upheld a park service plan for managing the
Merced River corridor in Yosemite National Park, removing a potential
roadblock to a number of upcoming restoration projects.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling in a two-year-old lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Anthony W.
Ishii rejected claims that the plan did not adequately protect the
river corridor and allowed harmful development.</LD>
<LD>   The case had split environmental groups, which lined up on both
sides of the lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   It was filed against the U.S. Department of the Interior by
Friends of Yosemite Valley and Mariposans for Environmentally
Responsible Growth.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall thrust of the suit was that the plan the park service
prepared for the Merced River was not based on protecting the river's
values," said Julia Olson, an Oakland attorney who represented the
two groups. They contended that the plan is "a template for future
development in Yosemite Valley and along the corridor."</TE>
<TE>   It also "allows unlimited numbers of people to use the river
corridor," contrary to congressional guidelines for wild and scenic
rivers, Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Park service management of Yosemite is a contentious issue,
environmentally and politically. Some complain that not enough is
being done to protect the valley from hordes of adoring visitors.
Others say plans to upgrade lodging and reduce parking and camping on
the valley floor will chase away visitors, particularly families of
modest means.</TE>
<TE>   A decision against the river plan could have affected some key
valley projects in the river corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had gone the other way, we would have had to re-look at a
lot of things," said Scott Gediman, Yosemite ranger and park
spokesman. He mentioned, for example, Yosemite Lodge reconstruction
and renovation of the Yosemite Falls parking area.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall," Gediman said, "I think the decision is a validation of
the Merced Wild and Scenic River Plan. We felt and still feel it is a
very good plan and will protect the Merced ... within Yosemite Park."</TE>
<TE>   Suit Splits Several Environmental Groups</TE>
<TE>   The Natural Resources Defense Council, National Parks Conservation
Assn. and Wilderness Society filed briefs in support of the river
plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The strength of the court ruling in the river lawsuit is really
most welcome in clearing the way for long-needed changes in the
park," said Jay Watson, regional director of the Wilderness Society.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club and Western Environmental Law Center were among
dozens of groups that signed briefs on behalf of the plaintiffs,
against the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said her clients had not decided whether they would appeal
the decision, handed down March 22 by the Eastern District of
California.</TE>

<KH>NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL FINAL MARYLAND 64, INDIANA 52</KH>
<HD>Out of Their Shell</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Dixon and Terrapins wear down Hoosiers
to earn first national title for school and long-suffering coach
Williams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Indiana held the lead once in the game and held that lead for eight
seconds in the second half Monday night before Maryland bushwhacked
notions of Bob Knight taking credit for it or Gene Hackman signing on
for a "Hoosiers" sequel.</LD>
<LD>   For as much as Indiana had the basketball lineage, and the
momentum, and the Terrapins' undivided attention, it ran much deeper
than that for Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland was bigger, stronger, quicker and, let's face it, has
really been a bunch of ticked-off turtles since blowing a 22-point
lead to Duke in last year's national semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   It was no big surprise in the end when Maryland went on a 22-8
blitz in the last 9:44 to run away with a 64-52 victory before a
crowd of 53,406 at the Georgia Dome to win the school's first
basketball national title.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, this was Maryland's tournament to lose, same as last
year, and this time the Terrapins had no intention of blowing it.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, this was Coach Gary Williams' just rewards 13 years after
rescuing a program from the taint of Len Bias' and subsequent NCAA
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the guy a break, right, if he doesn't know how to act in the
end. Maryland led by 15 points in the last minute yet Williams was
coaching like one Indiana shot would send the game to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Williams finally dropped his game face with 4.8 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   There would be no Jim Valvano leaps for Williams, a 57-year-old
who thought this night might never come. The man is so stressed he
blows through, on average, 10 suits a season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never done this before," Williams said of his subdued
reaction to winning his first title."So I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to be like. I'm very happy. It was a thrill. There's no
doubt about it. But I'm really tired."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, this was about three seniors, Juan Dixon, Lonny Baxter
and Byron Mouton, who had worked too hard for too long to let this
moment slip from their grasp.</TE>
<TE>   There was more than the Duke loss to overcome. Dixon lost both
parents to AIDS while he was in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I've grown so much," Dixon said. "I've developed as a person and
a basketball player."</TE>
<TE>   Mouton's lost a brother to gun shots only last December.</TE>
<TE>   It was Dixon, naturally, who let Indiana savor its 44-42 led for
eight ticks on the clock before drilling a three-pointer from the
corner to give his team the lead back for good.</TE>
<TE>   Who else but Dixon, who overcame a tragic youth and string-bean
legs to hit every clutch shot he needed to hit in a tournament in
which he averaged 27 points per game and was named the most
outstanding player.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, after his dagger shots ended a Connecticut threat in
the East Regional finals, Huskies' Coach Jim Calhoun remarked that
Dixon's baskets, "just hurt more."</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers are now feeling his pain.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana's eight seconds of second-half glory were wrecked when
Dixon took a pass from teammate Steve Blake and drained the
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to let the game just come to me," Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   It always does in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can't have the fear of failure," Williams said. "I
think you just have to take that shot. Not every big scorer wants to
take those shots. Juan has never backed away from a shot in that
situation."</TE>
<TE>   The pre-game talk focused on how Indiana's Dane Fife, a 6-foot-4
guard comprise for elbows and knees, might put the clamps on Dixon.
Well, Fife "held" Dixon to a game-high 18 points, five rebounds,
three assists and five steals.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon made six of his nine shot attempts.</TE>
<TE>   His three-pointer with 9:42 seemed to discombobulate Indiana. It
was like the first punch that leads to a knockout.</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, Fife and Co. did do a pretty good job on Dixon,
holding him without a basket for 20 minutes in what stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the cold-spell did not deter Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   "It just tells you he has no fear," Indiana Coach Mike Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana flailed back wildly, with Fife hitting a three-pointer to
cut the Maryland lead to 47-46, but then Dixon struck again with a
basket.</TE>
<TE>   A Baxter dunk with 7:22 left pushed the lead to five, then two
Tahj Holden free throws upped the lead to seven.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana was slipping fast from this game's vine, losing its grip.
The Hoosiers started firing shots in the general vicinity of the
basket. They made five of eight three-pointers in the first half but
only five of 15 in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana was out of range and gas.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't make shots because they did a great job of taking
away our open three-point shots," Davis said. "When we took them,
they were contested."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland kept pushing and Indiana couldn't push back.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter kept taking the ball to the basket. If not him, it was
sophomore forward Chris Wilcox.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter finished with 15 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so physical," Davis said of Baxter. "He was just kind of
bulling our guys out of the way. He would step in real hard. He got
the ball point-blank."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox had 10 points and seven rebounds. His defense also helped
hold Indiana star forward Jared Jeffries, who averages 17 points per
game, to eight points on 4-of-11 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, including his coach, was guessing before the game that
Jeffries was going to turn pro. The way Maryland shoved him around in
the post, perhaps he should reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely going to weigh into my decision just because
it's such an emotional thing," Jeffries said of the defeat.</TE>
<TE>   The national title game ended as it should have. The better team
won. Maryland finished 32-4. Indiana ended up 25-12. An Indiana win
would have been compared in longshot terms with North Carolina State
over Houston in 1983 or Kansas over Oklahoma in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoosiers, which rallied from 17 down to knock Duke out in the
South regional semifinals, went farther than anyone possibly
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Knight, the team's former coach, had to be flabbergasted the
program he left for dead two years ago could have come so far in his
wake.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they would have had to make another movie.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we went further than any team could go, other than
Maryland," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Three Hoosier starters are products of small Indiana hamlets.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrad Odle, a senior forward, is from Swayzee. "We basically got
a band, a gas station, a convenince store and a supermarket."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coverdale, a junior guard who hobbled through the tournament
on a bum left ankle, is from the small town of Noblesville.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor sent me a fruit basket on behalf of the entire town,"
Coverdale said.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana went farther than any team could go, other than Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it will soon sink in, but not now.</TE>
<TE>   Not for Indiana's Fife.</TE>
<TE>   "All we can be remembered for is the team that lost to Maryland in
the NCAA Championship game," he said.</TE>

<HD>Santiago Gets Plenty of Mileage Out of Mowatt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corona Santiago sophomore Taryne Mowatt landed a big-game trophy last
week when she outdueled junior Jamee Juarez, 1-0, and beat Hacienda
Heights Wilson, then No. 2 in The Times' rankings.</LD>
<LD>   Mowatt struck out 21 in nine innings and gave up only one hit.
Juarez struck out 16 and gave up three hits.</LD>
<LD>   "As a freshman [Mowatt] was MVP of the Mountain View League, and
we're very young this year--almost as young as she is--but she's the
real deal," Coach John Perez said. "Thank God she came to my school."</LD>
<TE>   Mowatt (11-3) has 200 strikeouts in 113 innings and has given up
26 hits.</TE>
<TE>   She has three no-hitters and six one-hitters.</TE>
<TE>   She opened the Charter Oak tournament with a perfect game against
Los Altos and finished the tournament with a four-hit, 13-strikeout
performance, beating Covina Charter Oak, 3-0, in the championship
game on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt won the pitching duel against Juarez and Wilson when Sarah
Murphy's bunt scored Jackie Adishian with one out in the bottom of
the ninth in the international tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Our school has been open since 1996," Perez said. "We won a title
in 1998, and that game against Wilson on Saturday was probably the
second-greatest game I've coached in this school's history, next to
our title game against Rosary.</TE>
<TE>   "Juarez is a great pitcher. She's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt, however, was a little more awesome.</TE>
<TE>   And Santiago (11-3-1) is poised to be one of the elite teams in
the next couple of years. The Sharks have only one senior.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always good, and we're worrying about this year," Perez
said, "but we'll be trouble the next two years."</TE>
<TE>   Century spotlight: The Irvine Woodbridge tournament continues this
week with 13 teams ranked in The Times' top 25.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the eight quarterfinalists on Monday were from the
Century League and are ranked among the top four in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   The three powers were on the same side of the bracket, which
created a quarterfinal with No. 1 Santa Ana Foothill facing No. 3
Anaheim Canyon on Monday. Foothill won, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   When the 32-team tournament resumes Saturday, Foothill faces last
season's second-place team in the Century League, No. 4 El Modena.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to out-think the system and went through the seeding
process for the first 20 teams," said Woodbridge Coach Alan Dugard,
who is the tournament's director. "I screwed up. I should have put El
Modena in the other bracket instead of Villa Park."</TE>
<TE>   Foothill advanced with a three-hitter by Alison Yin (11-0) and a
run-scoring double by Caitlin Lowe against Canyon pitcher Lisa Geer
(8-2), who gave up four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Hit and trot: Heather Slettvet of Canyon has five home runs, but
none were quite like No. 4 on Saturday against San Clemente. Her
three-run homer was on a hit-and-run play during an 8-2 victory.</TE>
<TE>   She added another homer later that day, giving Canyon a 1-0
victory in the second round of the Woodbridge tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch: Aliso Niguel's Joe Miller has coached sports for three
decades, but never has he seen a team endure injuries the way his
Wolverines have this season.</TE>
<TE>   Four key players have missed a combined 57 games.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Chezare Sievers (torn anterior cruciate ligament)
has missed 17 games; shortstop Lindsay Schafer (broken wrist), 13
games; pitcher Amanda Samonte (spine injury), 17 games, and catcher
Sheen Jarvis (groin pull), 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never experienced this before, and I've coached baseball,
football and basketball for 32 years," Miller said. "And that's just
the start of it."</TE>
<TE>   Utility player Danielle Cardenas broke her nose in a game on March
14 and missed four games, left fielder/pitcher Tiffanie Burnett broke
her nose and backup catcher Ashley Klein broke her finger in the same
game on March 22.</TE>
<TE>   If teams need to be strong up the middle, Aliso Niguel's injuries
have undermined that, as well as the pitching of junior Jennifer
Skaare.</TE>
<TE>   Among her performances, she had no-hit Anaheim Canyon through
seven innings before losing in the eighth, 7-2; and she lost a
13-inning, 18-strikeout game to Fullerton Troy, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame because she deserves a little better fate," Miller
said.</TE>

<HD>Two Ians Get the Job Done at La Quinta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For comic relief, forget about attending your local playhouse. Go to
any baseball game involving Westminster La Quinta High and listen to
the confusion among fans and scouts when discussion turns to Ian
Kennedy and Ian Stewart.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy pitches, Stewart plays third base, but with both being
17-year-old juniors named Ian, it's as if they were twins.</LD>
<LD>   Scouts have come up to Stewart and said, "I heard you pitched
great the other day."</LD>
<TE>   Scouts have greeted Kennedy by saying, "Are you the pitcher or the
third baseman?"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the stars were aligned on the day the two Ians arrived at
La Quinta three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time I've ever met another Ian in my life,"
Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   There are lots of Ians in Ireland, where Kennedy's ancestors came
from, and lots of Ians in Scotland, home of Stewart's distant
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   But how many Ians can throw 92 mph like Kennedy and how many Ians
can hit a baseball 420 feet like Stewart?</TE>
<TE>   "They're class acts," Coach Dave Demarest said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 6 feet 3 and 193 pounds, has seven home runs this season
after a sophomore year in which he drove in 31 runs. There are
professional scouts who swear he's one of the best hitters in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, 6-0 and 185, is 5-0 with an 0.47 earned-run average and
has 56 strikeouts in 30 innings. As a sophomore, he was 10-2 with a
1.33 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   These two Ians have immense talent. They've become good friends
because their dreams and interests are the same.</TE>
<TE>   Each owns a Chevy El Camino. "His is louder than mine," Stewart
said.</TE>
<TE>   Each knows how to make the other laugh. Stewart does
impersonations of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey and the Crocodile
Hunter. Kennedy makes weird faces.</TE>
<TE>   "I was real quiet my freshman year," Stewart said. "Now, my
coaches tell me to shut up because I'm always talking."</TE>
<TE>   Each is obsessed with baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "It means everything to me," Stewart said. "Baseball is my life.
I'm always looking up everything on the Internet, spring training
scores, fantasy teams.... "</TE>
<TE>   Said Kennedy: "I do about everything he does except the Internet.
I love the game. It's what I want to do for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is a power pitcher with excellent control. He threw a
five-inning perfect game as a freshman. His delivery is smooth and
effortless. Since he was 7, he has thrown the ball harder than most.</TE>
<TE>   "It just comes natural," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, he was throwing 86 mph. Last winter, his fastball
touched 92 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was an outstanding club soccer player who played on a
state championship team when he was 13, then never played again.</TE>
<TE>   "My coach knew I was involved in baseball and told me I had to
make a decision," he said. "I'm a better baseball player than soccer
player. I chose baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart impresses scouts by the way he can hit quality pitchers.
But his patience has been tested this season because so many pitchers
are choosing to walk him rather than risk giving up a double or home
run.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really anxious at the plate because I'm getting so many
balls," he said. "I want to hit so bad and I get frustrated when I'm
not playing to my potential. I'm trying to be more patient, let the
balls go and take my walks."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart bats third and Kennedy fourth in the lineup for La Quinta
(13-1), which has won nine consecutive Garden Grove League
championships and won its opening game Monday in the 16-team National
Classic.</TE>
<TE>   If work ethic is a sign of future success, these two Ians are
going places.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be busting your butt every day because there's always
someone wanting to work as hard or harder," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, confusion reigned when La Quinta played the
other La Quinta High near Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Add the two Ians into the equation and it was enough to cause
mental anguish, especially after one hit two homers and the other
dominated on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   It was just another example of what can happen when two Ians with
superior baseball skills play on the same team.</TE>

<HD>Another All-New Episode of Serena</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stories about the new Serena Williams--or is that the new, new
Serena Williams?--are starting to sound a lot like the ones about
Andre Agassi in his early days, the ones everyone has been so used to
hearing, about reinvention.</LD>
<LD>   He's more serious. She's more serious.</LD>
<LD>   He's mentally tougher. She's mentally tougher.</LD>
<TE>   He changed his hair again. She changed her hair again.</TE>
<TE>   He's getting stronger. She's getting stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes it somewhat fitting that Agassi and Williams walked
away from Miami as the biggest winners. Williams beat Jennifer
Capriati on Saturday in the final, fighting off seven set points in
the second set. On Sunday, Agassi beat Roger Federer of Switzerland
in the men's final and, more important, tied wife Steffi Graf with
his fifth title in Miami. "I'm moving up in the household," Agassi
said.</TE>
<TE>   Much had been made about another household rivalry, that of Serena
and her older sister, Venus. In the semifinals, Serena dispatched
Venus, 6-2, 6-2, only her second victory in their seven matches. More
about the quirky nature of those matches later.</TE>
<TE>   What can be said about Serena's newfound mental toughness is that
it was created after a particularly low moment in August. In an
electric, almost boisterous night match, Serena lost to Monica Seles
in the quarterfinals at Manhattan Beach after holding six match
points. In fact, Williams served for the match in the third set at
5-3, 40-0 and still managed to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Serena has lost only one of the last 24 matches she
has completed--the US. Open final against Venus. On that record is a
January loss in Sydney where she suffered torn ligaments in her right
ankle and retired against Meghann Shaughnessy, keeping her out of the
Australian Open.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Serena went on such a run was in 1999. A 16-match,
two-tournament winning streak--stopped by Venus in the Miami
final--started after another shaky mental performance, when Serena
squandered two match points against Sandrine Testud of France in the
third round of the Australian Open and lost.</TE>
<TE>   She went on to win her next two events, in Paris and Indian Wells,
and declared in California: "I don't lose those type of matches
anymore, if I'm ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Serena won the first family Grand Slam, taking the
U.S. Open in September at age 17, and beating Venus for the first
time at the Grand Slam Cup in Munich, Germany, the next month.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of moving smoothly ahead, Serena inexplicably slipped
back, and the aura of dominance was erased at the Australian Open in
2000. She arrived with no match-play preparation and lost in the
fourth round, and because of injuries and lackluster play, Serena was
firmly back in the role of little sister by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to last week.</TE>
<TE>   Buried in the hyped excitement of Serena's win over Venus in Miami
was the fact that they have yet to produce something close to a
compelling match. Frankly, even half the competitiveness of Seles vs.
Capriati would have been refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   The fans in Miami reacted accordingly, booing and whistling late
in the match. John Parsons of London's Daily Telegraph wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Some in the crowd, in view of the controversy which has
surrounded earlier matches between them, were not convinced that
Venus was putting in maximum effort. Yet anyone who had watched the
sisters in previous rounds would not have been surprised at the
outcome, or the one-sided manner in which the match unfolded."</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Richards of Foxsports.com interviewed one woman who had
come to Miami from St. Louis to watch the Williamses. The woman noted
that Venus didn't seem to hustle after every shot and lacked passion.
Although Venus was erratic in her previous match against Elena
Dementieva, she got down to business when necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "The questions and doubts about the veracity of a match involving
the Williams sisters will not go away anytime soon," Richards wrote.
"Until the sisters play some compelling matches that go beyond the
novelty, their matches will be viewed with some skepticism."</TE>
<TE>   What needs to happen is a semi-competitive match between Venus and
Serena, to turn it into sport, not a sideshow.</TE>
<TE>   If it should happen in a Grand Slam tournament, so much the better
for everyone involved. But we'll take anything, anywhere from Rome to
Palo Alto to New Haven, Conn.</TE>

<TE>   Three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil is set
to resume practicing Wednesday, according to his representatives.
Kuerten had surgery on his right hip five weeks ago and has received
permission from his doctor to start hitting.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard during the past weeks and now the good time has
arrived, the time to play again," Kuerten said. "I wanted to go back
feeling good in every aspect."</TE>

<DH>College football: Going into spring drills, UCLA coach says
quarterback spot is up for grabs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA opens spring football practice today with depth at every
position except the one where the Bruins seemingly could use some
options: quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Cory Paus returns for his senior season as UCLA's only experienced
quarterback, which isn't causing any parades through Westwood.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Coach Bob Toledo says he won't name a starter until the
week before the Sept. 7 opener against Colorado State, thus giving
him time to assess the untested abilities of freshmen Matt Moore and
Drew Olson, who will join the team in the fall.</LD>
<TE>   The embattled Paus must play his way out of the doghouse, where he
landed with a thud last season after coaches learned he had failed to
inform them about two alcohol-related driving convictions. Toledo,
after allowing Paus to start in UCLA's 27-0 loss to USC, demoted him
to third string for the season finale against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Though he is hopeful Paus has put his personal problems behind
him, Toledo says he wants to send a message by opening up competition
for a starting job that would normally be signed, sealed and
delivered to Paus. Redshirt freshman John Sciarra is the Bruins' only
other scholarship quarterback in spring practice. Senior Ryan McCann
left UCLA without an experienced backup by transferring to Division
I-AA Tennessee Chattanooga.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Cory to understand that he needs to do things right and
not get into any trouble," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Paus served a four-day jail sentence in January for his second
alcohol-related driving conviction in two years. He was also required
to pay a $1,300 fine, enroll in an 18-month alcohol-diversion program
and serve five years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to move on with his life," Toledo said. "He knows there
is a lot of pressure on him. But he feels like he's in good shape
right now. He has a good outlook. We had a lot of good talks in the
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't been as consistent as we would have liked, but I think
his attitude right now is as good as it's ever been. Hopefully he
will have a good spring."</TE>
<TE>   Paus performed well in spring practice last year but a summer
injury to his right thumb hampered his passing during the season and
contributed to a miserable four-game stretch in which he threw for no
touchdowns and eight interceptions in losses to Stanford, Washington
State, Oregon and USC. The Bruins finished 7-4 and out of the bowl
picture after starting 6-0 with a No. 4 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the injury had a big effect on him physically, and I
think hiding the DUI had an effect on him mentally," Toledo said.
"That's all behind him now. He wants to prove that he's the
quarterback that we all thought he would be."</TE>
<TE>   Moore, from Newhall Hart High, and Olson, from Piedmont High in
Northern California, are expected to observe spring drills as they
begin learning the Bruin offense with the knowledge that if anything
happens to Paus, one of them probably would become the starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them coming in not thinking they're going to redshirt,"
Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, which has 11 returning starters, must replace several key
players, among them tailback DeShaun Foster, center Troy Danoff and
linebackers Robert Thomas and Ryan Nece. Foster, expected to be taken
in the first two rounds of the NFL draft, was ineligible for the last
three games last season because he drove a 2002 Ford Explorer that
was lent to him.</TE>
<TE>   The off-the-field distractions caused by Foster and Paus prompted
Toledo to take steps to more closely monitor his players' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing we're trying to do is follow up more on what
[players are] driving, what they're doing and where they're going,"
Toledo said. "I won't be a detective by any means, but I want coaches
keeping a closer look."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Akil Harris and sophomore Manuel White, who split tailback
duties in Foster's absence, are the top candidates to fill the
starting spot. The 6-foot-3, 241-pound White will also get a look at
fullback, where the Bruins are inexperienced.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo said the Bruins must devise ways to get the ball in the
open field to running back Tyler Ebell, a redshirt freshman from
Ventura who ranks among the team's best breakaway threats.</TE>

<TE>   MARYLAND 85, SIENA 70</TE>
<TE>   March 15, first round at Washington</TE>
<TE>   Playing against the only team in the 65-team field with a losing
record, the Terrapins--the No. 1-seeded team in the East
Regional--made themselves right at home at the MCI Center, only 20
minutes from their College Park campus. The Terrapins kept the pesky
Saints (17-19) at a long arm's length, maintaining a double-digit
advantage after the game's first eight minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MARYLAND 87, WISCONSIN 57</TE>
<TE>   March 17, second round at Washington</TE>
<TE>   The Terrapins went on a 22-5 run to open the second half, with
Juan Dixon scoring 15 of his 29 points. "Once the hammer came down,"
said Wisconsin Coach Bo Ryan, "it came down pretty hard."</TE>

<TE>   MARYLAND 78, KENTUCKY 68</TE>
<TE>   March 22, East Regional semifinals</TE>
<TE>   at Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   There was no jumping around, no excited hugging, no pointing to
the stands. The Terrapins simply shook hands with the No. 4-seeded
Wildcats after closing out the victory by making 10 free throws in a
row and walked off the court, one step closer to a second consecutive
Final Four appearance. "Sometimes I wish they had more emotion," said
Maryland Coach Gary Williams. "We go in thinking we're good enough to
win and when we do, we move on to the next game."</TE>

<TE>   MARYLAND 90, CONNECTICUT 82</TE>
<TE>   March 24, East Regional final</TE>
<TE>   at Syracuse, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Pulled from a back-and-forth game with the No. 2-seeded Huskies
because of poor defense, and without a point, Terrapin junior point
guard Steve Blake took matters into his own hands when his coach
preferred the ball get into Dixon's. With 25 seconds left and the
shot clock nearing zero, Blake made a three-point shot that gave
Maryland a six-point lead in a game that had been tied eight times
and featured seven lead changes in the final 13 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MARYLAND 97, KANSAS 88</TE>
<TE>   March 30, national semifinal at Atlanta</TE>
<TE>   After losing all but five points of a 20-point lead to the
Jayhawks and 1:14 remaining, Terrapin thoughts were harkening back to
last year's Final Four when they blew a 22-point lead to Duke. But
Dixon scored four points on Maryland's next two possessions to shift
the tide.</TE>

<TE>   MARYLAND 64, INDIANA 52</TE>

<TE>   All the heartaches in one maddening March after another were
forgotten as the Terrapins overcame their shoddiest play of the
tournament to win the school's first NCAA basketball championship.
Seniors Lonny Baxter and Dixon combined for all of the points in a
9-2 run after Indiana had overcome a 12-point deficit and taken its
first lead of the game at 44-42 with 9:42 left.</TE>

<HD>Clemens Has Big Hand in Orioles' 10-3 Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The fans at Camden Yards cheered Cal Ripken, the Maryland Terrapins
and Johnny Oates. As an unexpected bonus, they got to watch their
Baltimore Orioles chase Roger Clemens to start the post-Ripken era.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens was cruising, and opening day seemed headed for a
predictable finish between the four-time defending American League
champions and a team given little hope this season, until the Rocket
tried to barehand a grounder.</LD>
<LD>   Clemens stayed in the game but wasn't the same. Two walks and a
wild pitch later, he was jolted for a grand slam by Tony Batista in
the Orioles' 10-3 victory over the New York Yankees on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw he was walking guys--I decided I was going to hit the first
pitch, whether it was a sinker or a fastball," Batista said. "I never
hit a home run off Clemens before. We have a better team than people
might think if we all do our jobs. I did my job today."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens, coming off his record sixth Cy Young Award, gave up eight
runs, walked five and threw two wild pitches--all after he tried to
field David Segui's grounder with one out in the fourth. Clemens
deflected the ball, then snatched his hand away and leaned forward
with both hands on his knees as Segui beat out the infield hit.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens threw a couple of warmup pitches before resuming, but his
control was gone. He walked Jeff Conine and Jay Gibbons before
Batista sent a drive a few feet beyond the 410-foot mark in
left-center field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when he initially reached out he knew it was the wrong
thing to do," New York Manager Joe Torre said. "It's something he's
been doing his whole career.... I think he was just trying to
overthrow after that."</TE>
<TE>   Clemens was taken to the hospital for X-rays, which were negative.
He has some swelling in his hand and is listed as day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Erickson, who sat out last season after elbow surgery, gave
up three hits in six innings in his first outing in 20 months. He
walked three of the first four batters he faced, leading to an
unearned run in the first.</TE>
<TE>   But Erickson settled down, escaped his only other jam in the fifth
and earned his first victory since July 20, 2000.</TE>

<DH>Firms' shifting of technical work to Mexico and China to cut costs
bodes ill for many laid-off Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than a century, Emerson Electric Co. rode the business
cycle, expanding when sales were high and cutting jobs when revenue went
south.</LD>
<LD>   That is still the strategy as the U.S. economy is poised to turn the
corner, but there is a twist: The St. Louis-based multinational won't be
hiring at its rural Mississippi plant--that facility is shutting down.
Instead, it expects to be hiring in China, the Philippines or Mexico. And
it won't just be assembly-line jobs going offshore. Emerson hopes to move
at least half of its engineering work to China and India.</LD>
<LD>   Emerson's example bodes ill for millions of laid-off Americans, who
may never see their jobs return with the economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   The increased flow of trade and investment across borders played a
large role in the economic expansion of the last decade. Now, during an
economic contraction, the flip side of globalization is apparent: U.S.
firms are finding cheaper places to do business where they also can sell
their goods. Along with computer chips and airplanes, it is jobs and
investment dollars sailing offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure when we come out of this recession we'll be
ready," David Farr, Emerson's chief executive, told analysts recently.
"When we finish this calendar year 2002, 70% of our manufacturing will be
in low-cost countries. That's a significant change from where we were
before."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Emerson announced the closure of its plant in
Oxford, Miss., and cutbacks in Montreal. A factory in Monterrey, Mexico,
is closing and some of the work is being shifted to China. By the end of
this year, the company will have shuttered 50 facilities and cut its work
force by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get the same amount of output, the same level of
technology without spending as much capital," Farr said.</TE>
<TE>   Others are close behind. Black &amp; Decker Corp., the nation's largest
power tool manufacturer, has announced the closure of three plants,
including a 400-employee Pacoima facility, and a shift of that production
to Mexico, China and Eastern Europe. Battery maker Evercel Inc. is
closing plants in Connecticut and Virginia and moving assembly work to a
joint-venture plant in Xiamen, China. Lear Corp., the world's
fifth-largest auto parts maker, said it will eliminate 6,500 jobs and
close 21 facilities, nearly two-thirds in the higher-cost regions of the
U.S., Canada and Europe. The company would not provide a breakdown of
where the jobs would be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Lear Chief Executive Bob Rossiter said the restructuring represents
"tough decisions to right size our company for future success."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson's decision to move the work of its Oxford plant to Mexico and
China means that 500 jobs--a quarter of the town's manufacturing
base--will disappear.</TE>
<TE>   When Max Hipp, executive director of the Oxford-Lafayette County
Economic Development Foundation, first heard the bad news, he tried to
persuade the town's largest private employer to stay. But Oxford, a town
of 11,756 where the median income is $20,383, already offers some of the
cheapest labor and operating costs in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about ways to save it, but with something of this magnitude
and the type of competition we face, there's really nothing we can do,"
the Oxford native said. "If we eliminated their [Emerson's] entire tax
burden, that wouldn't make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Labor leaders and other globalization critics had hoped the airport
shutdowns and lengthy border delays that followed the Sept. 11 attacks
would prompt U.S. firms to keep work at home.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we hope that American companies will be feeling patriotic
and they will have some commitment to their communities and their workers
and will address their cost pressures in some other way than by
outsourcing," said Thea Lee, an assistant director for international
economics with the AFL-CIO in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "With profits at the lowest percentage of corporate revenues in the
postwar period, firms are being forced to reevaluate their business
models and figure out whether or not things can be done more
efficiently," said Ross DeVol, director of regional studies at the Santa
Monica-based Milken Institute. "The recession just accelerates that
trend."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing jobs historically have been the most vulnerable to
global competition, but the latest round of outsourcing also is hitting
telephone operators, graphic designers, accountants and engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Trade experts argue that this global repositioning is healthy, simply
stepping up the shift of the U.S. economy toward a more high-tech
provider of services and more sophisticated products. By taking advantage
of lower costs abroad, U.S. firms can retain their competitive edge and
gain inroads in fast-growing markets in Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The beneficiaries include export-oriented developing countries slammed
by the U.S. slowdown. Leading that list is China, a more attractive place
to operate since it joined the World Trade Organization in December and
agreed to play by global trade rules. In spite of the global downturn,
foreign investment in China was up 14.9% in 2001 from the previous year,
according to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. firms are attracted to outsourcing because it makes it easier to
adjust their production and transfers the overhead costs and labor
expenses to their subcontractors. From 1996 to 2000, outsourcing by U.S.
firms tripled from $100 billion to $345 billion a year, according to John
Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an
international outplacement firm.</TE>
<TE>   Since the September attacks, companies are scrutinizing their supply
chain for weaknesses and looking more carefully at the stability of their
foreign suppliers and the countries where they do business, said John
Coyle, a professor at the Center for Supply Chain Research at
Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College of Business Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure they're really concerned [about Sept. 11] and they've put in
place safeguards, but no one is saying, 'We're not going to be global,' "
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., labor-intensive jobs in textile and apparel
manufacturing, toys and light electronics migrated long ago to low-cost
production areas in Asia and Latin America. Now, it is more sophisticated
industries such as semiconductor and aerospace manufacturing and network
computing that are moving offshore, in part because a strong dollar
raises the price of U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   Belt-tightening in the battered commercial aerospace industry has
forced companies such as Honeywell International Inc. and General
Electric Co. to look south for cheaper sources of components. Honeywell,
which purchases 15% of its $1.4 billion a year in raw materials abroad,
held a suppliers conference recently in Monterrey.</TE>
<TE>   "We still probably do less off-shore sourcing than most industries,
but with the dollar where it has been the last couple years, there's even
more pressure to look offshore," said Joel Johnson, vice president of
international affairs for the Aerospace Industries Assn. of America.
"Aerospace companies are doing more and more work in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stow, president of Orange-based Arden Engineering Inc., is
bucking the trend. Though he lost some commercial aerospace orders in the
Sept. 11 fallout, he has picked up business on the military side. By
forging long-term contracts with raw-material suppliers and upgrading his
machinery, he has been able to keep his 85 jobs in the U.S. and stay
competitive. He also produces more sophisticated structural components
that aerospace firms are less willing to source abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But thanks to infusions of foreign investment and technology,
developing countries are moving up the manufacturing chain quickly.</TE>
<TE>   In Emerson's reconfigured world, power modules or motors would be
designed in St. Louis but engineered and produced in Shenzhen, China, or
Mexicali, Mexico. Customers calling Emerson's ClosetMaid subsidiary would
talk to an operator in the Philippines. An accounts-payable center in the
Philippines or India would handle the bills for all of North America, a
consolidation of 400 offices.</TE>
<TE>   China is fast becoming a linchpin in Emerson's global empire,
contributing 44% of last year's $1.7-billion sales in Asia. In addition
to being a cheap manufacturing base, China represents one of the world's
fastest-growing markets for Emerson's power conversion and compressor
technology and plant automation systems.</TE>
<TE>   CEO Farr believes Emerson has a lot to learn from China about
producing a good product at the lowest price.</TE>
<TE>   "They can engineer a product so much faster than we can," he said.
"They can get a product family out in 12 months when it would take us two
years' time."</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court to Hear Three-Strikes Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court took up California's defense of its three-strikes
law Monday, saying it will rule on whether it is cruel and unusual
punishment to send a criminal to prison for 50 years for stealing $153
worth of videotapes.</LD>
<LD>   The case, to be heard in the fall, does not threaten the state's
authority to lock up for life those who commit several violent crimes.
However, the court could reject the state's use of a minor theft or drug
possession as a "third strike" that triggers a long prison term. It is
the first time the high court will rule on a direct challenge to a
three-strikes law.</LD>
<LD>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer called the justices' decision
"welcome news."</LD>
<TE>   Twice in recent months, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has
overturned the convictions of repeat criminals who were given a prison
term of at least 25 years for a third strike that was a petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   A Supreme Court ruling will "provide clarification to judges,
prosecutors and defense attorneys on how the U.S. Constitution's ban on
cruel and unusual punishment applies to California's three-strikes law,"
Lockyer said.</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who was asked by the 9th Circuit
to represent the two defendants, said it is cruel and unusual punishment
to impose a life term for a minor theft. "California is the only state
where a misdemeanor shoplifting charge can be the basis for a life prison
term," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   California's voters approved the three-strikes law in 1994 after the
kidnapping and murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas by Richard Allen Davis,
a repeat criminal who was on parole from an earlier kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Most states impose extra, longer prison terms on repeat offenders, and
26 states have a version of the three-strikes law. But California's law
is considered the most severe because it can lead to a life sentence for
a criminal who has committed nonviolent offenses, such as shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nearly 7,000 California inmates who are serving life terms
under the law, 331 are there for a third strike that was a petty theft,
according to the California Department of Corrections. An additional 603
were charged with a third strike for drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   The state's judges have consistently rejected challenges to these
stiff sentences based on the 8th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But in November, the 9th Circuit Court overturned the 50-year sentence
given to Leandro Andrade, a heroin addict from San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, he was convicted for two home burglaries. He was arrested
later on suspicion of several thefts and convicted of a federal charge
for carrying a small amount of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1995, after the state law took effect, he was stopped twice
for shoplifting. On Nov. 4, he walked into a Kmart in Ontario, stuffed
several videotapes into his pants and walked out. He was arrested in the
parking lot and charged with stealing $84.70 worth of merchandise, but he
was freed on bail.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, he tried again at a Kmart in Montclair. He stuffed
several videotapes in his pants and walked out. Again, he was stopped by
store personnel and charged with stealing merchandise, this time worth
$68.84.</TE>
<TE>   A jury convicted him of the two petty thefts. Normally, California law
treats such thefts as misdemeanors, punishable by six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors cited his two prior burglary convictions and, because of
his record, the new petty thefts were considered felonies. They also made
for the third and fourth strikes against him. The judge gave Andrade 25
years to life in prison for each theft. Because Andrade was then 37 years
old, his first chance for release would come in 2046, when he is 87.</TE>
<TE>   The state courts rejected his appeals, but he filed a writ of habeas
corpus that challenged his imprisonment as unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   In its 2-1 decision, the 9th Circuit agreed and ruled that his
sentence was "grossly disproportionate" to his offense.</TE>
<TE>   The decision turned on a 1991 Supreme Court case, Harmelin vs.
Michigan. In a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld a life sentence for Ronald
Harmelin, a former Air Force officer and honor guard at the funeral of
President Kennedy. Harmelin found himself in trouble by the mid-1980s,
when he was stopped by police who found a one-pound block of cocaine in
his car trunk.</TE>
<TE>   Under a Michigan law, Harmelin was sentenced to life in prison. The
high court's ruling in the case carried a mixed message. A punishment
cannot be "grossly disproportionate" to the crime, the justices said, but
they nonetheless upheld Harmelin's life sentence as not excessive for his
drug crime.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Harmelin case has emerged as the key precedent in the
dispute over California's three-strikes law, and not surprisingly, the
two sides differ on what it means. State prosecutors say the decision
shows that even extraordinarily stiff sentences are constitutional.
Defense lawyers point to its statement that a "grossly disproportionate"
sentence violates the 8th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   In citing the Harmelin case, the 9th Circuit's Judge Richard Paez of
Los Angeles wrote: "Our decision does not invalidate California's
three-strikes law. Rather, our holding is limited to the application of
the . . . law to the unusual circumstances of Andrade's case. . . . [His]
sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole for 50 years is
grossly disproportionate to his two misdemeanor thefts of nine
videotapes, even when we consider his history of nonviolent offenses."</TE>
<TE>   Paez did not say what other cases might be affected by the Andrade
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   In February, however, another 9th Circuit panel went further and
overturned the life sentences of two men who had committed several
violent offenses in the past. Richard Napoleon Brown had five felony
convictions on his record, including robbery and assault with a deadly
weapon, when he was arrested for stealing a $25 car alarm from a
Walgreen's store in Long Beach. This third strike sent him to prison for
at least 25 years, a sentence the 9th Circuit also called "grossly
disproportionate."</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer's office wasted no time in asking the Supreme Court to take up
the issue and to sweep aside the constitutional challenges to the
California law.</TE>
<TE>   The justices voted to hear the case of Lockyer vs. Andrade, 01-1127.
They also agreed to hear a similar case that has a different legal
posture.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Gary Ewing was seen walking with an unusual
stiff-legged limp as he left the pro shop at the El Segundo Golf Course.
As it turned out, he had three Calloway golf clubs in his pants
leg--clubs that sold for $399 each. He had nine prior convictions on his
record, and the attempted theft of the golf clubs sent him to prison for
at least 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Andrade, Ewing's was a new appeal to the Supreme Court, not
a habeas petition on behalf of a longtime inmate. Congress has tightened
the federal habeas corpus law and made it harder for U.S. judges to
intervene in state cases.</TE>
<TE>   By taking up Ewing vs. California, 01-6978, the Supreme Court gave
itself the option of ruling that a third strike for a petty theft is
unconstitutional for current and future cases, but not for prison inmates
who are challenging past convictions.</TE>

<HD>2 Catholic Dioceses Settle Abuse Suit for $1.2 Million</HD>
<DH>Church: Woman alleges priest molested her and two other priests
ignored her pleas for help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic dioceses of Orange and Los Angeles paid $1.2
million Monday to a 37-year-old woman who alleged in a lawsuit that a
popular priest molested her as a teenager, got her pregnant and paid for
her abortion.</LD>
<LD>   The church's settlement with Lori Haigh was the second high-profile
settlement the two dioceses have paid in eight months to a victim of
priestly abuse. It was the latest in a mounting string of cases
throughout the nation that have focused attention on the church's
tolerance of abusive clergy.</LD>
<LD>   Haigh, of San Francisco, held a morning news conference Monday at her
attorney's office in Irvine, and then filed a criminal complaint against
Father John Lenihan with the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A
spokesman for the department said it would launch an investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Haigh's lawsuit also claimed that two other priests--now high-ranking
officials with the Diocese of Orange--ignored her pleas for help 20 years
ago. She said she was abused from age 14 to 17.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan's attorney, Ron Talmo, declined to comment. But in a written
statement, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown said, "I am deeply sorry for the
hurt caused by the actions of Father Lenihan, and extend my apology to
Ms. Haigh and all victims of sexual clergy abuse."</TE>
<TE>   According to church officials, the two other priests deny ever meeting
Haigh. One of them, Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, held his own press
conference later in the day and threatened to file a defamation suit
against Haigh.</TE>
<TE>   At her press conference, Haigh said she got to know Lenihan because
she played the guitar in a youth group that performed at Sunday evening
Mass at St. Norbert Church in Orange, where he was a priest.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said that because she was involved in church activities five
days a week, the molestations occurred frequently. Lenihan would give her
rides to and from different youth-group activities, she said, and would
pull off at secluded places along the road to molest her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents felt I was safe with the church group," said Haigh, adding
that her parents didn't know about the sexual abuse until years later.
"And that it was OK to be brought home by your priest at 2 a.m. in the
morning."</TE>
<TE>   When she got pregnant at 16, she said Lenihan "told me that I had to
get an abortion." She said she tried to commit suicide, cutting her
wrists with a butcher knife. Still, she didn't tell her parents.</TE>
<TE>   She said the man she still sometimes calls "Father John" drove her to
the bank to get the money,</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't seem particularly concerned about the status of my soul,"
she said. "He gave me the money and said, of course, that he couldn't
come with me for the abortion," which Catholic teaching regards as a
mortal sin.</TE>
<TE>   Lenihan, who previously had admitted in a separate case to molesting a
minor and numerous affairs with women, was ousted in September as pastor
of St. Edward Church in Dana Point and last week agreed to be removed
from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said that in 1982, three years into the alleged molestations,
she went to Msgr. Baird, a favorite priest of her family and now the
current diocesan spokesman, about her relationship with Lenihan. After
she finished speaking, she claims, Baird came around the desk, kissed her
and rubbed himself against her.</TE>
<TE>   She said she pushed him away, partly because there was a window in the
door and she was afraid of she would get into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "As I was leaving, Father Baird gave me his telephone number and told
me to call him if I needed to 'talk again,' " Haigh said.</TE>
<TE>Baird Says Accusation Is Without Foundation</TE>
<TE>   Baird said at his press conference that he has no memory of meeting
Haigh, but he does have "100% memory that I have never made any
inappropriate contact with any person during my 33 years as a priest. . .
. This accusation is absolutely without any foundation."</TE>
<TE>   At one tense moment, Baird directly addressed Haigh, who attended his
press conference, saying, "I pray for you."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said afterward that she had expected an apology from Baird. "But
I'm not afraid," she said. "I'm telling the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh also alleged that a few weeks later when she went to complain to
Msgr. John Urell--now the Diocese of Orange's vicar general, who deals
with priest molestation cases--he accused her of lying and said, "How
long have you been telling this story?" He also told her never to be seen
in church again, she claims.</TE>
<TE>   Even more than the molestations, Haigh said, Urell's treatment of her
caused the most emotional damage over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrible betrayal," she said. "I just sat in my car and
cried."</TE>
<TE>   Urell was out of town Monday and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh alleged that in 1981 or 1982, a law enforcement officer caught
Lenihan molesting her in his silver Mercury Monarch at a secluded spot
along Silverado Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said the officer put her in his patrol car and asked her age,
which she told him was 16.</TE>
<TE>   She said the officer then spent about 15 minutes with Lenihan, before
telling her, "I don't want to ever see you here with him again," and
putting her back in Lenihan's car.</TE>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange paid 80% of the settlement, with Los Angeles
paying the remainder. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles was named in the
suit for two reasons. In 1978, Cardinal Timothy Manning, who died in
1989, had been warned about Lenihan's behavior by the father of another
teenager, Mary Grant. Grant, whom Lenihan admitted to molesting, was paid
$25,000 in 1991 by the church. Also, Haigh claimed that Lenihan had
introduced her to a priest in a San Pedro parish, who also tried to have
sex with her.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, media relations director of the Los Angeles archdiocese,
said the church tried without success to identify the San Pedro priest
mentioned in Haigh's complaint. But he said Haigh provided few details to
help identify him.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't have his name. She had very little identity information,"
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg noted that the Los Angeles archdiocese's share of the
$1.2-million settlement to Haigh was $240,000, most of which is covered
by insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "The archdiocese settled the case based on the estimated cost of
defending against the lawsuit, not on the merits of the allegations
regarding the unidentified priest," Tamberg said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said her experience with Urell, Baird and the police officer
caused her to keep silent for the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt coming forward would be futile," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she said a September column by Los Angeles Times columnist Steve
Lopez about Lenihan got her angry enough to file her lawsuit in December.</TE>
<TE>   In the column, Lenihan, under the pseudonym of "Father X," admitted to
some sexual improprieties, including those involving Grant, but not to
any misdeeds involving Haigh.</TE>
<TE>   During the press conference, Grant sat by Haigh.</TE>
<TE>   Last August, Ryan DiMaria received $5.2 million from the two dioceses
to settle allegations of sexual abuse by former Msgr. Michael Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh's attorney, Katherine K. Freberg, who also represented DiMaria,
said the reason for Haigh's relatively low settlement was questions about
the "statute of limitations." If the case were more current, Freberg
said, her client would have received more.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said the nearly four years of sexual abuse stopped when "Father
John moved on to another woman."</TE>

<HD>Roundups in Ramallah Target Police</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Stripped to their underwear, the Palestinian policemen emerged from
the Darraghmeh apartment building, some still bleeding from gunshot
wounds. Under heavy guard, they surrendered to Israeli forces before
being led away blindfolded.</LD>
<LD>   One policeman, the first out the door, was shot dead, apparently
because he was still holding his gun as he went to surrender. A second
bled to death in the overnight raid, witnesses said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli forces who have seized control of the West Bank city of
Ramallah have, in addition to cornering Yasser Arafat, rounded up
hundreds of men; raided houses, businesses and hospitals; and pounded
targets with artillery.</LD>
<TE>   Many of those captured or killed in Ramallah have been police, the
very security agents who would have to enforce a cease-fire and arrest
gunmen if Arafat were inclined to give such orders. Israel maintains that
many police have engaged in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli armor backed by gunships attacked the U.S.-built
headquarters of Col. Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the
West Bank. Flames and smoke were leaping from the sprawling complex.</TE>
<TE>   Attacking the police appears to be another step in Israel's
dismantling of the Palestinian Authority. During the last 18 months of
conflict, Israel has repeatedly hit police posts and various symbols of
Arafat's authority--from his headquarters to his personal helicopters--as
a way to undermine and isolate him.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Day 4 of the Israeli occupation of Ramallah, the army
announced that it had arrested more than 700 people in the city since
Friday, part of its hunt for suicide bombers and other militants who
attack Israelis. If recent history is any indication, the vast majority
of those arrested will be released; army officers acknowledge that most
of the really bad guys usually get away.</TE>
<TE>   The army's tactics have succeeded in terrifying civilians in Ramallah
and in wreaking great destruction on property in this once-bustling city.
But a growing chorus of critics is arguing that the tactics will not
eliminate terrorism. It's an important debate, especially since the
Ramallah operation is a prototype for the Israeli incursions that are
currently sweeping the West Bank and are seen by Palestinians as the
renewal of a long-term occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub, the security chief, telephoned CNN to angrily denounce the
attack on his headquarters and warn that such moves will not bring peace.
Rajoub was not in the compound, but Israel believes that he was hiding
dozens of militants there, including Arafat's top lieutenant, Marwan
Barghouti. A senior Israeli security source earlier said Israel would
begin going after such key Arafat aides.</TE>
<TE>Raids Show Risks of Close Combat</TE>
<TE>   The new raids, effective or not, also illustrate the hazards of
close-quarter combat in a crowded urban zone.</TE>
<TE>   A platoon of Israeli soldiers descended on the Darraghmeh building
Sunday after dark, residents said. They swept inside and clambered to a
fourth-floor apartment sheltering 22 Palestinian policemen. The
circumstances were not clear, but something apparently spooked the
soldiers--possibly an electrical box on the wall with wires hanging out
that vaguely resembled a bomb--and they opened fire on the police inside
the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the pattern of bullet holes, the soldiers then retreated
to a floor below and continued to shoot toward the policemen. Spent
cartridges littered the entire stairwell.</TE>
<TE>   After about a 20-minute firefight, the Israelis broadcast calls on
loudspeakers, ordering the Palestinians to surrender or the entire
building would be blown up, said Randa Zir, a 25-year-old who lives with
her family on the second floor. Injured and outgunned, the Palestinians
were ready to surrender, Zir said.</TE>
<TE>   But the first police officer to emerge was "stupid or inexperienced,"
she said. He held his hands up, but in them he had a gun. Soldiers
shouted in Hebrew for him to drop his weapon, but he didn't and they shot
him dead, residents said. An army statement later said they believed the
middle-aged man to be a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, the soldiers changed tack and ordered all
residents in the building to emerge one by one. Males were directed to
strip to their underwear, to expose any bombs or weapons, and to hold up
their identification papers. The policemen went first, helping at least
four comrades wounded in the earlier firefight.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the civilian men, about 10 of them. Like the police, they
were blindfolded and taken to a room in a neighboring building.</TE>
<TE>   The women came next, stepping gingerly over the body at the doorway.
They did not have to strip, but each woman had to lift her shirt to show
the soldier she was not armed. Zir said the soldiers even searched the
blankets of her 2-month-old niece.</TE>
<TE>   "One had a black mask and a really huge dog--I thought at first it was
a wolf," Zir said Monday in her living room. "They put us in a room full
of other women and told us to be quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Nader Manzi, an architecture student, said he was was ordered to
search rooms and help negotiate the surrender of the policemen.</TE>
<TE>   Manzi helped one of the wounded policemen to remove his clothes and
then walk out of the building. He had been hit in the back and was dying.</TE>
<TE>   "They left him bleeding until he died," Manzi said. "I told [an
Israeli commander] to bring the ambulance. He said: 'They are terrorists.
They were shooting at us.' "</TE>
<TE>   The policemen were members of the Palestinian National Security
Forces, the body of Palestinian police closest to a standing army.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of five other members of the same police force were found
Saturday. They were killed in questionable circumstances; they appeared
to have been killed at close range, with bloodstains indicating that they
may have been sitting on the floor when slain.</TE>
<TE>   The National Security Forces are led by Haj Ismail Jaber, who is
reported to be holed up with Arafat in his compound, surrounded by
Israeli tanks and troops. Israel has never implicated this specific
security agency in terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian police and Israeli troops squared off elsewhere in
Ramallah on Monday. In an especially fierce barrage, Israeli antiaircraft
guns targeted armed Palestinians hiding in a downtown commercial
building.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty booming rounds in a space of five minutes or less wrenched
chunks of brick from the walls and upper-story windows and hurled gray
puffs of cement dust into the air amid flashes of fire. One soldier was
seriously injured and several others hurt lightly. Several Palestinians
were injured.</TE>
<TE>Army Says Suspects Hiding Everywhere</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey told a news briefing in
Jerusalem that Israeli forces had arrested 700 people in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking for wanted people who are hiding in private buildings,
in apartments," he said. "We know they are hiding in official buildings.
There are some who are hiding under Arafat's wing. . . . Every place that
we know or suspect there is terror, we will be there."</TE>
<TE>   Kitrey added that soldiers have orders not to enter Palestinian
installations "unless we have clear information there are terrorists and
arms inside."</TE>
<TE>   But Danny Yatom, former director of the Israeli spy agency Mossad and
a security policy advisor to former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said the
current tactics will not stop suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that individuals who carry out attacks will be able
to survive even a very heavy search," Yatom told Israeli radio Monday.
"Even if we stay in the territories for a very long time, we will not be
able to smash the terrorist infrastructure."</TE>

<HD>Israel Hunts Arafat Aides as Assault Mounts</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Army pounds security complex in Ramallah and thrusts into
Bethlehem. Palestinians execute 10 accused of aiding the Jewish state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships pounded the main Palestinian
security headquarters in the West Bank and thrust into the center of
Bethlehem early today in a mounting offensive that Israel said was aimed
against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   As the offensive closed in on them, Palestinian gunmen killed 10
compatriots accused of collaborating with the Jewish state. Nine of them
were hauled from detention centers and shot in the streets Monday,
apparently to prevent their rescue by advancing Israeli forces.</LD>
<LD>   The predawn Israeli assaults near Ramallah and inside Bethlehem marked
one of the biggest operations against the 18-month-old Palestinian
uprising. It came on the sixth day of Operation Protective Wall, a
punishing counteroffensive that has left those Palestinian-ruled cities
and two others fully occupied by Israeli troops.</LD>
<TE>   The attack on the security headquarters signals a shift in Israeli
strategy. It shows that Israel has decided to hunt key aides to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli leaders say the offensive is aimed at a Palestinian terrorist
infrastructure blamed for six suicide attacks that have claimed more than
40 lives since Wednesday. A Palestinian wearing an explosive belt blew
himself up near Jerusalem's Old City late Monday, severely wounding the
policeman who had stopped the Palestinian's car.</TE>
<TE>   By dawn today, the sprawling U.S.-built complex housing the
Palestinian Authority's Preventive Security Service in Beitunia, just
west of Ramallah, was in flames after hours of explosions and bursts of
machine-gun fire.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials said about 400 people were inside and desperate
to escape, a claim that could not be independently verified. Col. Jibril
Rajoub, the West Bank's security chief, had reportedly ordered his men at
the compound to resist. Rajoub himself was not present.</TE>
<TE>   Israel maintains that several top Arafat lieutenants have been
implicated in attacks on Israelis and have been hiding in the building.
Among them is Marwan Barghouti, a Fatah activist who is the de facto head
of West Bank militias and patron of the uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti may have been in the complex, which was so ornate that it
contained a soaring atrium and lobby into which Rajoub could drive his
armored cars. Until now, senior Israeli officials had said Barghouti was
not a target. But Israel's intelligence establishment holds him
responsible for the relentless wave of attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub heads the CIA-trained Preventive Security Service and has
always been a favorite among American officials and numerous Israelis as
well. He has often been cited by Israelis as the kind of "pragmatic"
Palestinian they would prefer to work with. At least until recently, the
only photograph on his desk was one of himself with CIA Director George
J. Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   Many had assumed Rajoub's headquarters would be immune to attack. It
is one of a very small handful of police installations that had not been
bombarded by Israel in the last 18 months. The Preventive Security
Service is the body that would be responsible for most of the arrests of
militants demanded by Israel.</TE>
<TE>Gunfire Is Heard Blocks From Nativity Church</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, Israeli tanks and helicopters met some resistance as
they moved into the biblical city from two directions about an hour
before dawn, residents said. Exchanges of gunfire were heard several
blocks from the Church of the Nativity, built on the spot revered by
Christians as the birthplace of Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces surrounded the Dahaisha refugee camp on the edge of the
city and began searching homes for Palestinian militants, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat remained trapped in Ramallah Monday, pinned down by Israeli
troops within the walls of his compound. He and his followers call the
Israeli offensive a punitive campaign against all Palestinians who demand
an independent state.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not understand what the Israelis want out of this, but we are
expecting a long siege," said Mohammed Madani, governor of the Bethlehem
region, predicting severe hardship for its 150,000 inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   After a day of troop movements and sporadic gunfire across the West
Bank, the Israeli government announced late Monday the call-up of 11,000
reservists to join 20,000 others mobilized last week for the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Tension also ran high in the Gaza Strip, where gunfire from an Israeli
border observation tower killed a 13-year-old Palestinian boy near a
market in Rafah. And in Lebanon, Hezbollah guerrillas fired two rockets
at Israel for the first time since Israel pulled out of southern Lebanon
in May 2000. The rockets exploded harmlessly in fields.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces moved into the Palestinian towns of Kalkilya and
Tulkarm, in the northern part of the West Bank, on Sunday night and
Monday. They met little resistance, except for a bomb explosion that
wounded eight Israeli soldiers searching a home in Kalkilya.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Israelis moved in, Palestinian militants entered an
apartment in Tulkarm, brought out seven suspected collaborators and shot
them dead, Palestinian security officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment has been used by Palestinian military intelligence as a
detention center since the Israeli army destroyed the Tulkarm prison in
an incursion early this year. Guards at the apartment made no effort to
stop the killers, according to reports from the town.</TE>
<TE>   Two other men imprisoned for alleged collaboration were found dead in
Kalkilya, killed by compatriots who took justice into their own hands.
Several dozen Palestinians accused of helping the Israelis have been
executed, with or without trial, during the last year and a half of
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's was the largest number of such executions reported on a
single day of the Palestinian uprising. A 10th body was dumped Sunday
night near Bethlehem's Manger Square--that of a man captured and shot on
suspicion of e-mailing sensitive information to the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   As in Ramallah, the Israeli forces in Tulkarm and Kalkilya were
rounding up young men in search of terrorist suspects. The army said
Monday it had made 700 arrests in Ramallah during an offensive that has
left 22 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers dead.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops and armored vehicles began sealing off roads into and
out of Bethlehem on Sunday, preventing Mayor Hanna Nasser and other
Christians from traveling to Jerusalem for an Easter Sunday Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The siege prompted many of this city's residents to stock up on food
and lock themselves in their homes. The hospital sent home all
nonemergency patients to make room for an expected influx of wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks rolled into Bethlehem and two suburbs, Beit Jala and Al Khader,
before dawn Monday. They stopped about 500 yards from the Church of the
Nativity, but pulled back to the edge of the city during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Townspeople said the Israeli tank assault resumed in earnest early
today, backed by F-16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters.</TE>
<TE>Militants Wait in Square for Israelis' Arrival</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants appeared ready to resist.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen young militants wearing combat fatigues and
brandishing assault rifles lounged in Manger Square, their informal
headquarters, for most of the day Monday, waiting for the Israelis. Some
wore the gold and black headbands of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
militia linked to Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   It was Al Aqsa that claimed responsibility for the executions of
alleged collaborators here and in Tulkarm and for some of the suicide
bombings of the past week--including one carried out by an 18-year-old
woman who lived in the Dahaisha refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Our weapons are not as sophisticated as the Israelis', but we will
try our best to keep them out of here," said the most articulate of the
Al Aqsa militiamen, a 27-year-old Palestinian who wouldn't reveal his
name.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke calmly as his hands kept busy with a plastic cup full of
strong coffee, an M-16 rifle and a cellular phone. The rifle, he said,
was inherited from a boyhood friend killed in combat with the Israelis
here last month.</TE>
<TE>   The militiamen voiced enthusiastic loyalty to Arafat, saying they
would obey him whether his orders were to cease fire or to fight. For
now, they said, Arafat's orders are clear: "Confront the Israelis until
the last drop of our blood."</TE>
<TE>   The man with the M-16 defended the suicide bombers as "one of the only
ways in which we can put up a fight for the sake of our country and our
dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian support for the suicide bombings and the summary
executions was not limited to the militants. Elected city officials, town
elders and other noncombatants say they have been radicalized by recent
events.</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem was in Israeli hands for nine days in mid-March and 12 days
in October, and people here say its hardships can only get worse in the
coming days. Baby formula is already in short supply, the governor
reports, and 15 kidney patients are at risk because of a lack of filters
for the local hospital's dialysis machine.</TE>
<TE>   Manger Square, jammed with pilgrims for Pope John Paul II's Mass two
years ago when hopes for peace were relatively high, was nearly empty
Monday except for the militiamen. Religious souvenir shops were closed,
as were most of the city's businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Nasser said the summary execution here of Mahmoud Rahamie, 21,
was well deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very faithful informant," the mayor said dismissively. "As
happens to every other collaborator in the world, he was rejected by his
own people."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Muhaisen, 45, a lifelong resident of the Dahaisha refugee camp,
clutched blue worry beads with one hand and smoked a cigarette with the
other as he watched a report from Ramallah on television. He is a family
man who does much of his work for the refugee rights movement on a home
computer--not in the trenches of combat.</TE>
<TE>   "Suicide bombing is not part of our culture," Muhaisen said. "But we
are fighting an occupier who wants to humiliate us and get us to accept
the peace they are offering. We have exhausted passive methods. We don't
want violence, but it has been imposed on us. We are desperate. So the
Palestinians have invented a new form of resistance--a human bomb."</TE>
<TE>   "Let the world say we're terrorists," he added. "What can we do?"</TE>
<TE>Rumsfeld Condemns Iran, Iraq and Syria</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld used a Pentagon
news conference to condemn Iran, Iraq and Syria for supporting and
encouraging the suicide bombings in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said Iraq was financing terrorism against Israel by
subsidizing the families of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the world ought to know that Saddam Hussein's idea of having
a nice day is offering 10, 20, 30 thousand dollars, whatever it is, to
families of people who talk their children into going out and blowing up
a restaurant in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran and Syria are sending terrorists "down the Damascus Road through
the Bekaa Valley to southern Lebanon," where they launch guerrilla
attacks against Israel, and Iran is directly involved in shipping arms to
Palestinian terror groups, he said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Bush administration continued to place blame for the
conflict squarely on Israel's enemies, about 60 foreign peace activists
marched through Bethlehem and Beit Jala on Monday demanding an end to
Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the activists and a Palestinian cameraman for Associated Press
Television were wounded when an Israeli soldier fired several shots from
a machine gun into the pavement in front of them. Two Americans were
among the injured. The most seriously hurt, a British woman, underwent
surgery to remove shrapnel from her abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Larudee, 56, of Richmond, Calif., said he and other marchers were
trying to persuade Israeli soldiers to let them pass. "They waved us
away," he said. "We kept gesturing that we wanted to talk. After about
three seconds one of them started firing."</TE>

<HD>Protest Gives Way to People at Playa Vista</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first residents of the new community of Playa Vista moved into
their apartments Monday, a quarter century after initial plans for the
mini-city near Marina del Rey spawned one of Los Angeles County's most
protracted and bitter development struggles.</LD>
<LD>   The arrival of U-haul vans, women carrying armloads of clothes and men
hoisting couches into sandstone-colored buildings beside Lincoln
Boulevard marks a major watershed in a land-use dispute that began when
Jimmy Carter was president.</LD>
<LD>   One look around his unblemished two-bedroom apartment and Matt
Alexander, a 31-year-old pastry chef, was smitten: "It's clean. It's new.
It's mine." His first load of belongings included a pair of skis, a
skateboard and enormous stereo speakers.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, the arrival of the first occupants this week does not dispel the
uncertainty hanging over the 1,087 acres at the foot of the Westchester
Bluffs, where billionaire adventurer Howard Hughes built the World War
II-era Spruce Goose "flying boat."</TE>
<TE>   Still being hotly disputed are the final size and scope of the
development and of the largest remaining coastal wetlands in Los Angeles
County. Plans for the second phase of the project, due out this year, are
sure to renew debate about traffic, air quality and the safety of
building on top of an underground methane storage facility.</TE>
<TE>   But those issues are having no apparent effect on the many prospective
tenants who bid, sight unseen, for apartments and condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as it doesn't sink into the ground or explode, I'll be happy
here," said Alexander, lugging a mattress into his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The initial 120 units at the project's Fountain Park apartments will
be filled immediately, followed by another 585 units in the coming
months. Dozens of Moderne-style condominiums just to the south are
expected to open for their owners by November.</TE>
<TE>   This flesh and blood component--not to mention the new "Playa Vista,
CA 90094" ZIP Code--seems to confer on the budding community a permanence
and viability that has long eluded it.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody is actually sleeping at Playa Vista tonight," said Steve
Soboroff, president of the Playa Vista development firm. "It's not just
empty buildings and security guards at night. It's people's homes."</TE>
<TE>   In the coming months, the developer and a public land trust will try
to cement a deal that would alter the face of Playa Vista yet
again--doubling the size of the salt marsh preserve and slicing the
number of potential Playa Vista residents from 30,000 to about half that.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the opponents who have held the project at bay for more
than two decades by filing myriad lawsuits, chaining themselves to
bulldozers and discouraging powerful investors. In the process, they
altered the balance of power at City Hall and ensured that at least some
portion of the property is left to nature. They are not going away.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they remain incredulous at the 175,910 extra vehicles a day
that full build-out could bring to this traffic choke point between the
Westside and Los Angeles International Airport. And they say the adjacent
wetlands cannot thrive unless they are greatly expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Hanscom, director of the Wetlands Action Network, still insists
that the entire property that stretches from the 405 Freeway to the
Pacific Ocean should be restored to its natural state.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our supporters in New York sent us a National Geographic from
1979 with a photograph of these unfinished condominiums being blown up to
make way for park land," Hanscom said recently. "It gives us hope that we
can still do this."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, hundreds of prospective tenants welcome the possibility of
apartments and condominiums with ocean breezes in a region desperate for
new housing.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Marzano, a free-lance photographer, said he couldn't wait to
move in Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Location, location, location," Marzano said when asked why he is
taking a two-bedroom apartment at Playa Vista, sight unseen, months
before many of the promised amenities will be in place.</TE>
<TE>   Marzano is one of the 15% of tenants who will receive his apartment at
a reduced rate, under a development agreement with the city to make the
housing more affordable. That doesn't mean Playa Vista will be a haven
for the poor. A subsidized three-bedroom apartment, at about $700 below
the market rate, will still go for $1,635 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands more condos, townhouses, lofts and detached single-family
homes are planned, at prices expected to range from $200,000 to more than
$1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Come fall, a land purchase is supposed to open the way for
construction of a 3-million-square-foot complex of office buildings, each
up to five stories tall.</TE>
<TE>   The developers say 22,000 people have expressed interest in buying or
leasing one of the 3,246 dwellings in the project's first phase.</TE>
<TE>   "We desperately need housing," said City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter,
who represents the area and has been instrumental in shaping the
development. "I'm so thrilled people will finally be living there."</TE>
<TE>   Galanter came to office in 1987, deposing council President Pat
Russell, in large measure because of her opposition to an earlier version
of Playa Vista. That plan included high-rises on the coastal side of
Lincoln Boulevard, a golf course and a new boat basin for Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter insists that current plans for the first phase strike the
proper balance amonghousing, commercial uses and open space.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, this is a project designed to do smart growth," she said,
"with jobs and housing in the same place and a substantive amount of land
under permanent protection."</TE>
<TE>   After Howard Hughes' death, his Summa Corp. approached city and county
officials with the proposal for a new community on the property. The 1978
development plans included high-rise office buildings, 7,000 housing
units and 600 boat slips at adjacent Marina del Rey. The company planned
a nature preserve of about 72 acres.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Coastal Commission approved the project in 1984, it
had grown to more than 8,800 apartments, houses and condominiums, and the
proposed Ballona Wetlands preserve had expanded to 175 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists sued to nullify the plan and to preserve more of the
wetlands--an oasis for several endangered species and a stopover on the
Pacific Flyway for migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   A decade after the initial proposal, many believed the impasse had
finally ended. A new developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, took over the
project and quickly agreed to set aside or restore 340 acres of open
space, which includes a section of Ballona Creek.</TE>
<TE>   That solution was good enough for one generation of environmentalists,
and the compromise won the crucial blessing of Councilwoman Galanter,
allowing the first phase of the project to advance.</TE>
<TE>   But a new set of critics was soon dogging Playa Vista. They were
determined that the entire property be spared from development. And their
relentless opposition threatened to scuttle any progress the developer
managed to make.</TE>
<TE>   When DreamWorks SKG and the city struck a deal in 1995 to bring the
glamorous anchor tenant to the property, for example, opponents dressed
in frog suits to confront the conservation minded studio chiefs, accusing
them of hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   The opponents sued time and again and usually lost. But the delays
drove up the cost of the project. And, after four years of uncertainty
and problems with financing, DreamWorks pulled out of the project in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the repeated delays, the investment banks and union
pension fund that own most of Playa Vista hired real estate broker
Soboroff last October to move the project ahead. The former mayoral
candidate had helped close the deals to build Staples Center arena and
the Alameda Corridor rail project.</TE>
<TE>   Soboroff has tried to bring a sense of urgency to the development and
touts its energy-saving technology--in lighting, heating and air
conditioning, transportation and other areas. He buzzes around the
property in an electric golf cart and says residents will be able to use
the vehicles, instead of their cars, for short trips or errands on the
property.</TE>
<TE>   That will do little, opponents say, to stop the traffic that will soon
deluge neighborhood streets.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase of Playa Vista, alone, will generate an additional
39,500 vehicle trips daily, putting roughly 4,500 more cars on the road
during morning and evening rush hours.</TE>
<TE>   Playa Vista plans to spend $100 million on road improvements,
including the widening of Lincoln and Culver boulevards. As a result, the
developer says traffic will move more freely through many intersections.</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors worry that widening the roads and improving more than
100 intersections will only shift bottlenecks, not eliminate them.</TE>
<TE>   "It increases the capacity of the roads right next to the site, but it
doesn't solve the problem of how do people get there," said Bryan Gordon,
president of the Mar Vista Neighborhood Assn. Nor will it help with the
wall of traffic that inches along the San Diego Freeway, as it narrows
near the site, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, opponents have charged that the greatest hazard at Playa
Vista will be the Gas Co. facility that stores methane in the bedrock
deep below the site.</TE>
<TE>   The builders say they can monitor and control any leaks with an
elaborate system of airtight membranes and vents beneath concrete
foundations. A team of city officials has declared that the new buildings
can be made safe.</TE>
<TE>   But skeptics say the gas is too mobile and will be able to accumulate
to explosive levels in the new homes and offices.</TE>
<TE>   The final magnitude of Playa Vista may turn largely on a deal to
convert more of the project to open space. In years gone by, such a
purchase seemed like dreamy speculation. The builders were unwilling and
the real estate simply cost too much for the public to acquire.</TE>
<TE>   Yet these are unusual times.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Playa Vista now a willing seller, but the state government
for the first time in a decade has enough bond money to make a deal work.</TE>
<TE>   The deal began to gain momentum last year when the developers of Playa
Vista signed an agreement with a land broker, the Trust for Public Land,
to allow a state-certified appraiser to set a fair price.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement specifies that Playa Vista's developers can reject the
sale, but cannot bargain for more than the appraised price. If a sale can
be completed, the trust would transfer the land to the state of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a moment in time that we have to seize," said Reed Holderman,
Trust for Public Land's California director. "Does anyone want to go
through another 20 years of battles and controversy?"</TE>
<TE>   As the appraisal nears completion, Soboroff said he is optimistic. He
believes the price will be high enough for him to make a strong
recommendation to the owners to sell. Principal investors include Union
Labor Life Insurance Co., investment banks Morgan Stanleyand Goldman,
Sachsand Oak Tree Capital Management Co. and Pacific Capital Group, which
is run by Global Crossing chief executive, Gary Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to move people to the middle and make them 70% happy," said
Soboroff. "The owners have said the value of the land is well over $200
million. That is considered out of the ballpark by Reed [Holderman] and
his folks. I think it's going to be somewhere around. . . . What's 70% of
$200 million?"</TE>
<TE>   Hanscom, the most vocal critic of Playa Vista, vows to fight the
proposed sale if the appraisal sets the value above $100 million.
Anything more, she said, would amount to bailout of the developers and
inflate future open space purchases along the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, she believes that her group and other members of Citizens
United to Save All of Ballona can prevent the Playa Vista builders from
ever developing the 193 acres--without making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that our coalition has brought them to this
point, to want to sell this land," Hanscom said. "Why should we give up
now?"</TE>

<HD>Detainee Is Bin Laden Aide; 'He Knows Where People Are'</HD>
<DH>Terror: U.S. hopes man taken in Pakistan will divulge details on
cells and plots around the world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces in Pakistan have taken custody of a Saudi-born militant
believed to be so critical to Osama bin Laden's international terrorism
network that he could help them identify Al Qaeda cells and operatives
around the globe.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials confirmed Monday that
they have netted Abu Zubeida, one of Bin Laden's top deputies and a
potential suspect in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, officials said,Zubeida helped link Bin Laden's inner
circle with scores of terrorist groups in Europe, the Middle East, Africa
and elsewhere. After the Taliban regime collapsed in Afghanistan last
fall, officials said, Zubeida also was entrusted  with rebuilding Al
Qaeda--and plotting future terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "He knows where [Al Qaeda] people are around the world," said a U.S.
intelligence official who confirmed the captive's identity. "Plus, we
have unambiguous information that he has been planning future terrorist
attacks against U.S. interests and allies worldwide. So he is a person
well worth catching."</TE>
<TE>   The capture, especially if Zubeida cooperates during questioning,
marks a rare success in the hunt for terrorists that forms the backdrop
to the war in Afghanistan. Despite huge cash rewards and a massive U.S.
military and intelligence effort, only a handful of top terrorist leaders
are known to have been captured or killed since last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say Zubeida may have acted as an intermediary between Bin
Laden and the hijackers who seized four jets and crashed them in New
York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, killing more than 3,000 people. However,
he has not yet been charged or indicted.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have had little success in persuading captured Al Qaeda
operatives to disclose significant details in interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   A senior law enforcement official, who also confirmed Zubeida's
capture, said counter-terrorism agents are angling to interrogate him.
"There is a fair amount of excitement about this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy will be put through the ringer for days and weeks," said a
former senior Clinton administration counter-terrorism official.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take at least 96 hours . . . to get him to spill everything,"
said the former official. "If they don't crack him by then, he is a very
tough nut. If not, they will keep going. He is probably having the worst
time in his entire life right now."</TE>
<TE>   William H. Webster, a former FBI and CIA director, said interrogation
efforts will "go beyond name, rank and serial number" because Zubeida is
considered an unlawful combatant and not a prisoner of war.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional third-degree would be inappropriate, such as using
physical force," Webster said. "I don't want to spell out how late they
can keep him up before letting him go to bed, but they have a right to
aggressively try to gain information from him."</TE>
<TE>   Webster said interrogators will operate on the assumption that Zubeida
knows about terrorist plots that may be in the planning stages.</TE>
<TE>   "This area is very murky. We are feeling our way," he said. In the
current situation, he added, "some will want to go by the book, others
will want to throw out the book."</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, whose real name is thought to be Zain al-Abidin Mohammed
Husain, was captured Thursday in a raid in central Pakistan. Pakistani
troops shot him three times in the legs and groin when he tried to
escape, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   He was handed over to U.S. authorities Sunday and was receiving
medical care Monday at an undisclosed location, the officials said. He
was reported in serious but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they used various forms of visual and technical
methods to identify him. One U.S. official said proof of Zubeida's
identity, which he declined to explain, was found Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida, 31, was a key recruiter for Al Qaeda, officials say. He
screened potential candidates, helped arrange their travel to and from
training camps in Afghanistan and helped new graduates join or create
cells, they allege.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida communicated with cell members to coordinate specific attacks,
U.S. officials say. They say he has been implicated in the August 1998
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, which killed 224 people,
and the October 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen, which killed
17. He also allegedly played a role in the failed plot to bomb a Los
Angeles International Airport terminal during the millennium
celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say Zubeida succeeded Mohammed Atef, the Al Qaeda
military commander who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in November. "After
Atef was killed, he took on an increased operational role," the
intelligence official said.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida and his aides have been trying to reconstitute Al Qaeda's
command and control center in Pakistan since December, when they
apparently fled across the border from Afghanistan during fighting at the
Tora Bora cave complex, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida's group, which included about two dozen Saudis, Moroccans,
Sudanese, Egyptians and other non-Afghans, apparently switched safe
houses every few weeks to avoid detection. U.S. officials say hundreds of
other Al Qaeda and Taliban supporters also may be hiding in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, U.S. intelligence had detected an increase in money
transfers and e-mail communications and other evidence indicating a
possible plot against the U.S. or its interests abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding Zubeida, officials said U.S. forces and allies have captured
only three Al Qaeda leaders and killed nine since fall. The whereabouts
of 15 other senior figures, including Bin Laden, are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The tally is similar for the Taliban, the extremist Islamic regime in
Afghanistan that provided sanctuary for Al Qaeda. So far, U.S. and allied
forces have killed two and captured four senior Taliban leaders. About 21
others are missing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials clearly hope that Zubeida, or one of several dozen
others arrested in raids in Pakistan last week, will help lead them to
Bin Laden, who is accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although he declined to confirm Zubeida's capture, Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld said Monday that Zubeida is "if not the No. 2, very
close to the No. 2 person in the organization."</TE>
<TE>   Relying on the communications intercepts and other evidence supplied
by U.S. intelligence, American and Pakistani operatives captured Zubeida
and the other suspects in a series of predawn raids Thursday in
Faisalabad, Lahore and Multan, all in central Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Zubeida had been using another alias, Abu Ubaid, but
admitted his real identity during questioning.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, the Clinton administration deployed a team of
counter-terrorism experts to Sudan, in part to catch Zubeida.</TE>
<TE>   "We were literally hours behind him . . . and he slipped through our
fingers," recalled a former State Department official involved in the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida's role in Al Qaeda came to light last summer in federal court
in New York. Ahmed Ressam, who had been convicted in the 1999 plot to
bomb LAX, appeared as a government witness at another trial and detailed
his understanding of Al Qaeda--and Zubeida's responsibilities in the
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam told the court that Zubeida was "the person in charge" of the
Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "He accepts you or rejects you," said Ressam, adding that Zubeida paid
all expenses at the camps and made travel arrangements for those
attending.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam said Zubeida ensured his entry into the camps in early 1998.
Ressam said that when he returned home to Montreal seven months later,
Zubeida asked him to send some passports for future terrorists to use.
Ressam said he never succeeded in getting the passports.</TE>

<DH>S. Korea: The daughter of former dictator Park Chung Hee may run
for president. But unlike his iron fist, hers would be a gentler hand,
she says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>In the tradition of powerful men and their ambitious daughters in
Asian politics, there is yet another new face with a familiar name. This
time it is the daughter of Park Chung Hee, a dictator who ruled South
Korea through force and fear for nearly two decades until his
assassination in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   After a relatively uneventful term in the National Assembly, Park Geun
Hye stunned the political establishment recently by announcing that she
was quitting the conservative opposition party and planning to start her
own organization.</LD>
<LD>   She has hinted that she will run for president to replace incumbent
Kim Dae Jung, a former dissident whom--as the small world of South Korean
politics would have it--her father tried to have murdered at least once
in the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Park's possible candidacy is filled with such quirks and
contradictions. Although she is political royalty, she says her new party
will bring fresh blood to the arena. And though she blatantly appeals to
nostalgia among some for the stability of her father's strong-arm rule,
her pitch focuses on democratic reform.</TE>
<TE>   "Different times need different types of leadership," Park, 50, said
during an interview in her National Assembly office, a tidy room
decorated with orchids and political kitsch from her father's rule. "My
father was criticized as a dictator, but that should not overshadow his
accomplishments in restructuring the country. He brought Korea out of
5,000 years of poverty. What he left unaccomplished was democratization
of the system."</TE>
<TE>   The latest polls show that Park would come in a distant third, with no
more than 15% of the vote, if she runs in the Dec. 19 election. But
whether it is the undeniable glow of celebrity or the novelty of being a
woman eyeing the top spot, Park is commanding far more than her share of
attention in the race. The Korean-language version of Newsweek recently
put Park on its cover, labeling her South Korea's Indira Gandhi--a
daughter who took power after her father's death.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000, is barred by law from
seeking another five-year term. And all those who are hoping to succeed
him are relative political midgets in the shadow of his towering
presence.</TE>
<TE>   "She is the only political leader who can gather a crowd when she goes
to deliver a speech," said Park Jai Chang, a political scientist at Sook
Myong Women's University in Seoul, who is no relation.</TE>
<TE>   Park Geun Hye, a thin, delicate-looking woman, is said to be the
spitting image of her popular mother, who was shot to death in 1974 by an
assassin aiming for Park Chung Hee. The oldest of the ruling couple's
three children, Park was summoned home from her studies in France to
serve as first lady. She attended social functions with her father until
his 18-year rule was ended by a bullet fired by his intelligence chief.</TE>
<TE>   Under the next military dictator, Chun Doo Hwan, Park was banished
from public life lest she attract a political following. She confined
herself to largely ceremonial jobs on university boards and foundations
until 1998, when she was elected to the National Assembly as a member of
the conservative Grand National Party.</TE>
<TE>   Park's resume is somewhat thin for a politician seeking national
leadership. In addition to her short stint in the assembly, her main
qualification is the five years she served as South Korea's de facto
first lady.</TE>
<TE>   "The first lady's position is not an easy job," Park said in the
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to South Korea's equivalent of the White House, she noted:
"The Blue House is a place where you encounter worries from day to night.
If there is a drought in the country or if there are armed commandos
penetrating from the North, you have a crisis. I watched my father's
anxieties for years. The experience made me very attentive to this
country and gave me a sense of obligation that I should contribute
somehow."</TE>
<TE>   Politically, much of her appeal comes from a grudging admiration here
for her father, who is widely credited with engineering the "economic
miracle" that lifted South Korea from poverty even though he is
considered a tyrant who impeded the growth of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding her slim chance of winning, Park has already had an
impact on the presidential race. She resigned Feb. 28 from the GNP,
complaining about party leader Lee Hoi Chang's dictatorial manner in
handpicking assembly candidates. It was Lee who four years earlier tapped
Park for office.</TE>
<TE>   Until Park quit, Lee was the favorite to become the next president.
But Park's move eroded support for him. He was forced last week to resign
as party chief, and the latest polls show him as much as 17 percentage
points behind the favorite from the ruling Millennium Democratic Party,
former dissident and human rights lawyer Roh Moo Hyun.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a certain commonality between all these daughters in Asian
politics," political scientist Park said, referring also to Presidents
Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the
Philippines. "These female leaders have shown antagonism toward the
political establishment. They are symbolic figures too, fighting
corruption and leading the path toward political reform."</TE>
<TE>   Political pundits here believe that Park intends to run this year with
the idea that even if she loses, she will hone her skills and become a
more credible candidate in the future. People who know her seem to use
the same words in describing Park: tough, disciplined, cool and
self-sacrificing.</TE>
<TE>   It was part of the legend surrounding Park Chung Hee that, when his
wife was assassinated during a ceremony at which he was speaking, he
finished the speech and even stayed through a performance by a choir
rather than show anguish.</TE>
<TE>   "President Park asked that his children not show tears in public after
their mother died, and that was the way she behaved. Very disciplined," a
former aide to the assassinated leader, who knows the family well but
asked not to be identified, said of the assemblywoman.</TE>
<TE>   Sunny Han, a Korean American businesswoman who is promoting Park's
candidacy, added: "Between the death of both of her parents, she has
survived more than most people, and that has made her strong. She is no
spoiled princess."</TE>

<HD>Reformers Gain Seats in Ukraine Parliament Vote</HD>
<DH>Europe: Communists will no longer be largest group in legislature,
but no party wins majority. Government is accused of interfering in
election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY MYCIO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine
</DL>
<LD>Ukraine's parliamentary elections produced no clear winner Monday,
as reformers edged out Communists but did not secure a clear majority.</LD>
<LD>   Despite allegations of government interference and vote-rigging,
observers cautiously predicted that the new legislature would be markedly
more reform-minded than any of its predecessors.</LD>
<LD>   With nearly all of the 24 million ballots counted, the reformist Our
Ukraine party, led by popular former Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko,
had 23% of the vote; the Communist Party had 20%; and the pro-president
For United Ukraine had about 12%. But percentages won by the parties
account for just half of the seats in the 450-member parliament. The
other 225 are decided in local elections for individuals.</LD>
<TE>   However, it was clear that for the first time since Ukraine became
independent a decade ago, the Communists would not form the largest
faction in parliament.</TE>
<TE>   The Communists and For United Ukraine are allied with President Leonid
D. Kuchma, an unpopular leader who is mired in scandals and
internationally isolated. But the other four top vote-getters are parties
that oppose Kuchma either openly or surreptitiously.</TE>
<TE>   "This parliament will contain more people who were [Kuchma's] victims
than ever before," opined the Internet publication Ukrainian Truth.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma unexpectedly left the capital, Kiev, on Monday for a weeklong
visit to the Crimea. Although he praised Sunday's election as "extremely
democratic," he had no comment on its result.</TE>
<TE>   International observers' reactions to the election were mixed. In a
report Monday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lauded a more democratic new election law, the active role of
nongovernmental organizations in monitoring the campaign and balloting,
and the wide spectrum of political choices. But it accused the government
of interfering in the campaign, and it criticized the media's excessive
partisanship in favor of For United Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The elections were marred by "a general atmosphere of distrust, both
among voters and among candidates," the OSCE reported. However, no
organization has said that the final results might be declared invalid.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department said the Ukrainian government
could have done more to ensure a level playing field for all political
parties.</TE>
<TE>   "We're particularly disappointed that officials did not take steps to
curb the widespread and open abuse of authority, including the use of
government positions and facilities, to the unfair advantage of certain
parties," State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker said.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the local races into account, Yushchenko's party and For United
Ukraine, led by Kuchma's ex-administration chief, Volodymyr Lytvyn, were
each expected to garner 110 seats in parliament. The Communists were
expected to get 65.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charged that authorities abused resources to benefit Lytvyn's
party in the local district races. For United Ukraine came in third in
voting for the party slates, but it took a commanding lead in the local
races.</TE>
<TE>   Yushchenko said Monday that exit polls showed that his party's share
of seats should have been greater, and he charged authorities with
election fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "We estimate that from 8 to 12% of the vote has been falsified," he
told journalists, and he said his party would challenge the results in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "Democracy is the loser," he added. "That is the main defeat of these
elections."</TE>
<TE>   Lytvyn, who in February called pollsters "prostitutes," dismissed the
exit polls and criticisms, saying that unexpectedly strong results for
opposition parties were proof that the elections were honest.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise to many, the Socialist Party--led by the implacably
anti-Kuchma former parliament speaker Oleksandr Moroz--had about 7% of
the vote, slightly more than another coalition opposing the president led
by former Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. A third group, the
United Social Democratic Party, garnered only 6% despite relentless
promotion on the country's two most-watched television networks.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining 27 parties in the race did not garner the minimum 4% of
the vote needed to win a slate of seats. Under Ukraine's election law,
votes cast for slates are divided among the winning parties.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts predicted that Our Ukraine and For United Ukraine would act
as magnets around which other parties would coalesce. Neither Yushchenko
nor Lytvyn rejects the possibility of working together on some issues,
such as a less punishing tax code. But other economic reforms that might
threaten the shadowy business interests heavily represented in For United
Ukraine could put Lytvyn on the same side as the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest uncertainty surrounds Kuchma's future. The Moroz
and Tymoshenko blocs are unlikely to total more than 50 seats, but
opposition sentiments could gain momentum--particularly if allegations of
Kuchma's involvement in the death of journalist Georgi Gongadze in 2000
are substantiated, or if new accusations of illegal arms sales to Iraq
prove true.</TE>
<TE>   Without such developments, the lack of a decisive election winner will
give Kuchma room to maneuver, especially in preparation for presidential
elections planned for 2004, Russian lawmaker Dmitry Rogozin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The existing president's field of support has been sharply reduced,"
he said. "But for now, it still exists."</TE>

<LD>Yugoslavia has agreed, under U.S. pressure, on full cooperation
with the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and transfers of suspects
to the court should follow, Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said.</LD>
<LD>   "We [made] a unanimous decision that, as a member of the U.N., we are
obliged to fully cooperate with the ICTY [International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia] and have asked all state bodies to fully
cooperate," Svilanovic said.</LD>
<LD>   Yugoslavia failed to hand over indictees to the Hague tribunal before
a March 31 U.S. deadline, triggering a freeze in aid from Washington
worth about $40 million.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>President Robert Mugabe, declared the winner in disputed voting
last month, vowed to crush any civil uprising against his rule and
dismissed calls for a rerun of the election, state radio reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The government will not tolerate attempts to make Zimbabwe
ungovernable "by those bent on causing chaos, especially those who did
not agree" with his election victory, Mugabe said.</LD>
<LD>   "Those who want to rebel and become lawless, we will deal with them
firmly," he said. "They think we will continue to be soft. That's gone.
It's finished. We are in a new phase, and there will be a firm
government."</LD>
<TE>   The radio said Mugabe was addressing a victory party Sunday in his
home district of Zvimba, about 60 miles northwest of Harare, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   The National Constitutional Assembly, a reform alliance that includes
the main opposition and human rights, labor and church organizations, has
called for street protests Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In weekend advertisements in independent newspapers, organizers said
the protests and a campaign of civil disobedience will go ahead in
defiance of new security laws banning political demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   The advertisements urged Zimbabweans to turn out in large numbers in
the capital and regional centers to protest elections the organizers said
were rigged during voting and marred by political violence and
intimidation against Mugabe opponents.</TE>

<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Prince Charles paid a moving public tribute to his late grandmother
Queen Elizabeth on Monday, praising her "panache, style and unswerving
dignity" as mourners across Britain left teddy bears, candles and wreaths
in public places in her honor.</LD>
<LD>   In a national broadcast, Charles spoke quietly and lovingly of the
Queen Mum, who died Saturday at age 101, saying she was "an institution
in her own right, a presence in the nation, at once indomitable, somehow
timeless, able to span the generations; wise, loving, and an utterly
irresistible mischievousness of spirit."</LD>
<LD>   "Above all, she understood the British character and her heart
belonged to this ancient land and its equally indomitable and humorous
inhabitants, whom she served with panache, style and unswerving dignity
for very nearly 80 years," Charles, 53, said.</LD>
<TE>   The Queen Mum was the widow of King George VI and the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II, Charles' mother.</TE>
<TE>   At noon, artillery pieces thundered the start of 41-gun salutes at a
dozen locations around the country and in the colony of Gibraltar.</TE>
<TE>   "She always had a smile for everyone," mourner Elizabeth Addley said
at a ceremony at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland. "She broke with
tradition. While Queen Mary was rather more stiff and formal, she came
along and was a breath of fresh air."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's coffin rested Monday in a small stone chapel at Windsor
Castle, where family and staff could pay their respects before she is
taken to lie in state in London before her funeral April 9.</TE>
<TE>   The long period before the funeral allows for the complex logistics of
a large ceremonial funeral. King George VI died Feb. 6, 1952, and after
lying in state in London he was laid to rest Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Although life went on as normal in much of the country, hundreds of
people showed up at royal locations such as Windsor Castle.</TE>
<TE>   The Racing Post, a daily horse-racing paper, covered its front page
with a photo of the Queen Mum and the headline "A Sport in Mourning." She
was a trackside regular and successful horse breeder and once said she
read the Racing Post every morning.</TE>
<TE>   The public left more than 500 bouquets of flowers outside St. George's
Chapel at Windsor Castle. Tributes at the site also included teddy bears,
candles and wreaths of poppies. Everywhere, flags flew at half-staff, and
thousands of admirers of the former queen signed condolence books at
royal palaces and homes around the country.</TE>

<LD>A Dracula theme park in Transylvania has attracted enough
investment for the project to go ahead, the Romanian government said.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have bought $2.9 million worth of stock, more than 60% of
what is needed by law for the project to proceed, Tourism Minister Dan
Matei Agathon said.</LD>
<LD>   The park is to be built in Sighisoara, hometown of 15th century Prince
Vlad the Impaler, who inspired Bram Stoker's "Dracula." It will have
rides, a golf course, a Gothic castle and shops.</LD>
<TE>   The park plans have sparked concerns that a nearby medieval citadel
might be damaged by tourists. Religious leaders fear that the park could
draw Satanists.</TE>

<HD>Law That Permits Euthanasia Takes Effect</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Dutch law legalizing euthanasia quietly took effect, making the
Netherlands the first country to allow doctors to help end the lives of
terminally ill patients who wish to die.</LD>
<LD>   Parliament voted last April to permit euthanasia in cases where
patients face a future of unbearable, interminable suffering. Those
wishing to benefit from the law must make a voluntary, well-considered
request to die.</LD>
<LD>   Many Dutch doctors, however, say the law simply decriminalizes a
practice that has long been a reality.</LD>

<HD>A Cup Shows It Can Handle Itself--and Mug for Cameras</HD>
<DH>Military: A Marine's drinking utensil goes AWOL but soon has an
e-mailed tale to tell of heroism and high jinks in the war on terrorism.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN AFGHANISTAN
</DL>
<LD>On Nov. 25, as U.S. forces were mobilizing for the international
campaign against terrorism, a personalized coffee mug disappeared from
the wardroom at a San Diego Marine air base.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks later, the owner, Marine Maj. Dennis Stephens, received a
photograph via e-mail of his coffee mug aboard the Navy amphibious
assault ship Bonhomme Richard somewhere in the Pacific Ocean en route to
South Asia. The photo showed the coffee mug nestled in a Navy life vest.
It was accompanied by the following message addressed to Stephens under
his aviator call name Nunya:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Nunya, I am sorry to have left without saying goodbye, but I have
always longed to sail the high seas and saw the Bonhomme Richard as my
best opportunity. I promise to be careful, and will try to stay out of
trouble. Sincerely, Mug.</LD>
<TE>   Thus began the Many Adventures of Mug. Not long after that first
message, a Marine pilot's prank pulled on his former executive officer
was being shared via e-mail with hundreds of U.S. service members around
the world, a military manifestation of the "traveling objects" trend. In
the lonely and often tedious routine of overseas military duty, Mug's
travails provided relief.</TE>
<TE>   For despite his promise, Mug did not "stay out of trouble." Oh no, he
did not.</TE>
<TE>   Mug's misadventures included nearly getting killed in a terrorist
attack in Singapore and being roughed up in a fight with U.S. Army
soldiers in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Through it all, Stephens
good-naturedly played the role of Mug's concerned master.</TE>
<TE>   A Times reporter encountered Mug and his Marine friends in
Afghanistan. On the condition that the cup's exact whereabouts not be
revealed, the officers shared some of his messages and photographs. The
following is an account of Mug's exchanges with Stephens:</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 25, 2001: Porcelain mug bearing Marine aviator wings and name
Nunya disappears from coffee room of Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar.
Stephens, executive officer of the HMH-462 "Heavy Haulers" helicopter
squadron, reports the disappearance to his commanding officer, Lt. Col.
Rick Schmidt. Mysteriously, Schmidt's mug, a.k.a. Pappy, is left
untouched, although the cup reportedly suffers depression over the
departure of its friend.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 15: Stephens receives first message from Mug aboard the Bonhomme.
Mug reveals that he left California by stowing away in the helmet bag of
Capt. W.D. "Slick" Collier, whose itinerary appears to match that of the
cup almost exactly.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 18: Mug reveals that he was caught stowing away on a Super
Stallion helicopter flight over Wake Island and confined to quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Nunya, I finally made it onto my first flight today, but
unfortunately I was apprehended in the act. I had made it into the cruise
box of one of the aircraft, and when I thought it was safe to look
outside a crew chief grabbed me! Sincerely, Mug.</TE>
<TE>   Later in December: Mug writes that he has been hanging out in the
Bonhomme Richard's command tower:</TE>
<TE>   Dear Nunya, As you can see I am back at work on the ship again. I like
hangin' with the Boss, he lets me talk on the radios, and I feel like I
can make people do stuff. . . . I don't know if I will be allowed to be
the tower flower anymore. With all those colorful switches and buttons
around, I couldn't resist seeing what some of them do. Turns out one of
my favorite ones sounds the collision alarm, and the other is a fire
alarm. Anyway, I got to meet several high-ranking individuals who sure
know how to make you feel guilty for singing on the 1-MC. I mean, who
couldn't love my rendition of Hank Williams Jr.'s "If Heaven Ain't a Lot
Like Dixie" anyway? Sincerely, Mug.</TE>
<TE>   Jan 10, 2002: Alarming news from Singapore, where the Bonhomme Richard
is making a port call. Stephens receives an anonymous e-mail from some of
Mug's Marine comrades with a photograph of a shattered coffee mug:</TE>
<TE>   To whom it may concern: We regret to inform you that Mug has been a
casualty during a recent port call in Singapore. While standing guard
aboard USS Bonhomme Richard at Changi naval base, Mug was witness to
terrorists' attempts to sabotage the U.S. ship. A group of 3 swarthy
terrorist bastards approached the ship while it was docked and threw a
grenade toward the catwalk. The grenade failed to make it more than 4
stories up the ship, however it came to rest on the catwalk where Mug was
standing his watch. With less than a matter of seconds to make a
decision, Mug jumped from his post and threw himself on the grenade. The
majority of the blast and shrapnel was absorbed by Mug. This entire event
was witnessed by over 200 Marines and sailors who quickly overwhelmed the
terrorists, disemboweled them, and fed them to the local fish and sea
gulls. Mug's actions prevented possible damage to vital portions of the
ship, to include the wardroom lounge big screen television and adult
movie collection. Mug is currently in stable condition. . . . With luck,
and a little super glue, [he] may someday be able to hold room
temperature beverages again.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 12: Stephens erroneously assumes that Mug has been killed in
action, which would be the fourth mug that has been mysteriously lost
from his command. Although devastated, the major informs the men that
unless they come up with another mug, they will be reassigned to a desert
base.</TE>
<TE>   Gentlemen, The news of Mug's passing has indeed hit me hard. I have
received cards and condolences from all corners of the planet. I can
sense they are heartfelt and sincere as I know each of you shares in my
grief, particularly those now obligated to replace Mug. His selfless (and
ultimately his last) breathtaking act of bravery will echo in eternity (I
heard that in that cool gladiator movie). It's the kind of heroic deed
that can only be inspired by years of porcelain training, shared
hardship, a deep love for ones fellow man/mug, and/or a really awesome
collection of classic boat porn. As this is the 4th in a series of 5
mugs, and since all but one have incurred similar, equally heroic and
tragic deaths, I am moved to recover, at any cost, the 5th and final mug.
. . . Rest assured that if you fail in your task I will not fail in my
task of securing a tour for each of you at our most beloved training
center: 29 Palms. Love, XO (executive officer).</TE>
<TE>   Later in January: Concerned about possible retribution, Mug's helpful
comrades, who seem to communicate through Collier, send Stephens a
photograph of a replacement mug: a baby bottle filled with milk. The
major, on duty in the Mariana Islands in the Pacific, is touched but not
totally forgiving. Stephens writes back:</TE>
<TE>   Dear Mug, I was certainly touched by your offer to send a replacement.
Imagine the joy I felt when I discovered you actually sent me
pictures--again. Just knowing you are still risking your delicate
porcelain while I sit here in the peaceful environs of the Mariana Island
Chain fills me with a sense of despair. . . . Still, it is no replacement
for the joy you provided. Heed my earlier warnings; there are still those
among you who will attempt to defile your integrity. I long for the day
when they will once again fall under my power and authority. Your Mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 19: Great news. Mug has recovered. He writes from Kandahar about
a fight with Army soldiers. The e-mail is accompanied by a photo of Mug
ensnared in concertina wire in front of the Kandahar airport terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Nunya, I am happy to say that I have recovered from my concussion
and shrapnel injuries, and have made it back into the fight. . . . You
should see all the Army guys here! They are all a little overweight and
need haircuts. . . . Some of them . . . were singing, "Short people got
no reason--" (I know you can relate) and a small scuffle broke out. I
ended up stuck in this concertina wire, but they went away with some
porcelain impressions in their heads! . . . I bet if Pappy Mug had been
here we coulda' taken 'em! I don't know what kind of airport this is, I
looked forever but couldn't find a bar anywhere! Sincerely, Mug.</TE>
<TE>   February and early March: Mug has adventures in Kenya, which he says
is not nearly as hot as Twentynine Palms. Finally, he travels to a
location in Afghanistan that is headquarters for Operation Anaconda, a
major battle in the eastern area of the country. It is here that Mug,
accompanied by Collier, is interviewed and photographed. By this time Mug
is a hero known to all on the base, where more than 3,000 American
personnel are posted. Mug and his Marine pals live in a squalid tent next
to outhouses. But, according to Collier, nothing seems to dampen Mug's
spirits.</TE>
<TE>   March 12: Mug messages from the front, accompanied by a picture taken
with some rugged-looking Afghan fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Nunya, As you can see, I am back in the land of Afghanistan and
meeting lots of new people. My two friends here Mike and Jimmy live
locally, and were happy to be in a picture with me. The mountains here
are beautiful and covered with snow, but I have not seen any ski resorts
yet. Sincerely, Mug.</TE>
<TE>   March 15: Alarmed by the looks of the men holding Mug in the
photograph, Stephens responds in mock desperation:</TE>
<TE>   For the love of GOD. . . . I'll pay any ransom if you don't let the
guy on the left drink from Mug. . . .! Helpless in the Marianas.</TE>

<HD>Bush Urges Sharon to Keep 'Pathway to Peace'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Arafat takes the brunt of the administration's
criticism, but the president refuses to call him a terrorist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In careful but conspicuously pointed language, the Bush
administration Monday sent a series of public signals to Israel urging
"maximum restraint" and expressing deep concern about its siege of West
Bank towns.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush and other U.S. officials continued to call, first and
foremost, on Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat to take
decisive action to rein in extremists. Yet another suicide bombing--the
sixth in six days--triggered a new round of condemnation from American
officials.</LD>
<LD>   "There will never be peace so long as there's terror," Bush told
reporters Monday. "I'd like to see Arafat denounce the terrorist
activities that are taking place, the constant attacks. . . . There's a
lot of innocent people who hurt in the region because of the senseless
violence and senseless murder."</LD>
<TE>   But the president also took pains Monday to say that Arafat does not
fit his definition of a terrorist, illustrating a key difference between
the United States and Israel in their approaches to the raging Mideast
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he does not consider Arafat a terrorist because the
Palestinian leader has agreed both to peace with Israel and to two
specific, ongoing U.S. efforts--plans put forth by CIA Director George J.
Tenet to achieve a cease-fire and by former Sen. George J. Mitchell
(D-Maine) for resuming talks on a final settlement with Israel. Since the
Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon, Bush has repeatedly stated
that anyone who supports, funds, fosters or tolerates terrorism should
also be considered a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel intensified its siege of the West Bank on Monday, Bush also
called on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon not to close all roads back
to the peace table.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for the prime minister to keep a pathway to peace
open, to understand that, on the one hand, Israel should protect herself
and, on the other hand, there ought to be . . . the capacity to achieve a
peaceful resolution to this issue. It's important for Israel to
understand that," Bush said during a photo opportunity with Gov. George
Pataki of New York and New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   And in language cleared by the White House, the State Department said
the U.S. is "gravely concerned" about the Israeli siege of West Bank
towns, particularly Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The United States decided to go public with its views Monday in part
out of frustration with Israel's failure to respond to repeated messages
through diplomatic channels--from Washington and a host of other
capitals, said a U.S. official who asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   "The language reflects our frustration. Humanitarian relief is being
detained or delayed. Ambulances are being shot at. American citizens and
an American journalist were shot at. . . . We've said all these things in
private already," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   So the administration took the unusual step of publicly voicing
concerns about the consequences of its staunch ally's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "We deplore the killing and wounding of innocent Palestinians, and we
urge Israel to use maximum restraint to avoid harm to civilians and
permit access for humanitarian services," State Department spokesman
Philip T. Reeker said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   It is "imperative" that the Israeli military "exercise the utmost . .
. discipline," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Reeker specifically cited deep concern about the shooting of "peaceful
demonstrators" that injured two Americans, among others, in the West Bank
town of Beit Jala on Monday. The State Department urged the Israeli
government to launch a "thorough investigation" to avoid other such
incidents. Reeker pointedly noted that the United States would monitor
the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department also had tough words for the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "Terror, including suicide bombings, will not advance the Palestinian
cause, and it brings the Palestinians and Israelis no closer to peace,"
Reeker said at the daily briefing.</TE>
<TE>   But he welcomed a promise from Sharon that Arafat would not be harmed.
The involvement of Arafat--the Palestinians' elected leader--and the
actions of Palestinian Authority officials are critical to ending the
escalating bloodshed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot lose sight of our goal: an enduring and comprehensive peace
and security for Arabs and Israelis alike," Reeker said.</TE>

<HD>Muslims Split on 'Terror' by Palestinians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
</DL>
<LD>Islamic countries at a major meeting on terrorism were split Monday
about whether to condemn Palestinian suicide bombers as terrorists, but
they were united in condemning Israel's widening offensive into
Palestinian territory.</LD>
<LD>   The delegates passed a unanimous resolution accusing Israel of
"dragging the region toward an all-out war" and calling for U.N.
sanctions to deter Israeli military action.</LD>
<LD>   Fault lines appeared immediately as the Palestinian representative
disagreed with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the meeting's
host, who said that suicide bombers killing Israeli civilians should be
condemned.</LD>
<TE>   "It is not necessary to condemn the suicide bombers, because we have
to take into consideration the reasons behind somebody [being] willing to
lose his life," the Palestinians' de facto foreign minister, Farouk
Kaddoumi, told reporters at the conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is "the highest and
worst kind of terrorism, and the human being, if he sacrifices his
life--there must be a reason," Kaddoumi said. "The reason is state
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Foreign Minister Ivica Misic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, chief of
his country's anti-terrorism team, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about race or religion," Ivica said. "I agree that if a
person kills or harms a civilian he is a terrorist, no matter how noble
his struggle may be."</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said later that Mahathir's
comments should not be taken out of context and that the Malaysian leader
believed that the suicide bombers acted in response to Israeli
aggression.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the Israeli occupation that has brought about this," Syed Hamid
said after Monday's round of talks closed.</TE>

<HD>Protests Against Israel Intensify in Arab World</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Demonstrators clash with police in Cairo. Emergency summit

<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>Anti-Israel protests escalated Monday, with demonstrators clashing
with police in the Egyptian capital, as Arab leaders searched for ways to
defuse the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters also took to the streets in Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan
and Yemen.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration in Egypt was the most violent here since Israel
seized control of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
compound Friday.</LD>
<TE>   After a group of artists, intellectuals and opposition politicians
called for a march from Cairo University to the nearby Israeli Embassy,
hundreds of protesters ran toward the embassy and broke through a line of
riot police.</TE>
<TE>   Police responded with tear gas and water cannons and whipped
demonstrators with batons, pushing them back toward the campus. The
protest lasted seven hours.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty protesters were arrested, and nine police officers were struck
by stones. Sixteen protesters--most of them suffering the effects of tear
gas--were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters called on the Egyptian government to close the Israeli
Embassy, accused the United States of giving Israel the green light for
its offensive and called for the boycott of American products.</TE>
<TE>   But calls to boycott U.S. products have been heard before in Egypt and
have gone largely unheeded. Egyptian officials say their ties with Israel
give them an opportunity to influence Israeli policy.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 protesters, mostly women, staged a march on the U.S. Embassy
in Amman, the Jordanian capital, where they called on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to intervene in the Mideast crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in Zarqa, about 17 miles northeast of Amman, about 3,000
people chanted, "Death to Israel!" and called for holy war against the
Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said an emergency summit was
possible. The group held a regular summit last week at which Arabs made a
historic peace overture to Israel. Lebanese Foreign Minister Mahmud
Hammud said Arab League diplomats would meet today. Qatar added its voice
to that of Yemen in calling for an emergency summit.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says No Need to Prove Lindh Killed</HD>
<DH>Hearing: The government does not have to show American Talib harmed
specific U.S. citizens, jurist rules. The key is whether he knew Al
Qaeda's general aims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors conceded in court here Monday that John Walker
Lindh had no "personal involvement" in the death of CIA Agent Johnny
"Mike" Spann, who was the first U.S. fatality in the ongoing war against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   But Judge T.S. Ellis III said the government does not have to prove
that specific people were selected for murder. Rather, he ruled that
prosecutors must show only that Lindh knew that the general aim of his
involvement with the Taliban and Al Qaeda was to kill Americans.</LD>
<LD>   In the daylong pretrial hearing in U.S. District Court, Ellis also
denied a defense request that prosecutors immediately provide a detailed
list of its evidence against Lindh, including whom he conspired with and
what he allegedly did to foment terrorism against Americans. Lindh's
attorneys say his grand jury indictment is "overly broad," thus difficult
to defend against.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing was the first of many court sessions to come as both sides
prepare for jury selection in August. The trial against the 21-year-old
former Northern Californian--the first of several trials stemming from
the Sept. 11 attacks and the war on terrorism--is shaping up to be a
crucial test of the government's ability to bring terrorists to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Spann was killed during a prison riot in Afghanistan shortly after
failing to persuade Lindh to speak to him there about his involvement
with the Taliban armed forces and his time at an Al Qaeda terrorist
training facility.</TE>
<TE>   At an earlier hearing for Lindh, Shannon Spann said he should receive
the death penalty for her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that while Lindh is charged with conspiracy to commit
murder, they are not alleging that any specific victims were targeted.
Rather, they charge, Lindh was providing material and other services to
the Al Qaeda and Taliban networks to further a "general goal" of killing
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The government plans to show that Lindh knew his fellow conspirators
were plotting to "kill anyone and everyone" who was an American national
and that the goal of Al Qaeda was to kill Americans in "Afghanistan,
Pakistan and the U.S.," prosecutor John Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment previously accused Lindh of deaths "around the world."
It charges that Lindh conspired to murder U.S. nationals, to provide
support and services to foreign terrorist organizations and to use
firearms and destructive devices during crimes of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the government could prove, through Lindh's own statements
to U.S. authorities, that he and the other members of the Taliban and Al
Qaeda were intent on murdering Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant knew after Sept. 11 that part and parcel of being in
these organizations was opposing Americans in this war," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's chief attorney, James J. Brosnahan, argued Monday that it was
unfair for the matter to go forward without the defense team knowing
exactly how the government intended to prove its case.</TE>
<TE>   In arguing unsuccessfully for a detailed list of the evidence against
his client, Brosnahan said he was unsure how to build the best defense
without knowing key factors, such as who the alleged victims were and how
Lindh allegedly helped the conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The allegations are so general, the defense really can't prepare," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We should know what the charges are," he added. "In Afghanistan
there's still a state of war, and in Pakistan a state of difficulty,
especially for Americans. It is 8,000 miles away from this courthouse."</TE>
<TE>   But the judge ruled that the government, which has so far turned over
about 1,000 pages of material to the defense, is not required at this
stage to lay out its entire case. But, he warned, prosecutors will have
to convince a jury that Lindh knew exactly what the Taliban and Al Qaeda
were all about.</TE>
<TE>   "The government," the judge said, "will have to show the defendant
joined this conspiracy knowing it was designed to kill Americans."
Explaining his ruling, the judge described Lindh's alleged crimes as
similar to the work of Mohamed Atta and the other 18 hijackers on Sept.
11, who killed indiscriminately.</TE>
<TE>   "You think Atta knew all the names of the people he was going to kill
when he got on that plane?" Ellis asked rhetorically. " . . . Do you
think any terrorist cares who he or she kills?"</TE>

<HD>Bush to Return Historic Island to N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Monday that he intends to return Governors
Island, a historic 172-acre parcel of prime federal property in New York
Harbor, to the city and the state of New York, a move that officials said
should help revitalize Manhattan's economy.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's action also would enable officials to relocate to the island a
portion of City University of New York, which would open up classroom
space to alleviate overcrowding throughout the city's school system.</LD>
<LD>   "This is great news," said New York Gov. George Pataki, who was joined
by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for a brief meeting with Bush in
the Oval Office. For years, officials in New York have pressed Washington
to give the island--federal property for two centuries--back to New York.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's disclosure of his intentions left unanswered many questions
about the unusual transfer, including any specific authority that Bush
wields as president to "sell" a national monument.</TE>
<TE>   Half a mile south of the tip of lower Manhattan, Governors Island
affords a spectacular view of the city and harbor, including the Statue
of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   During its recorded history, which spans 400 years, the island has
been used as a fishing camp for the Manhatas Indians, a lumber stand, a
pasture, a jail for Confederate soldiers during the Civil War and a
staging area in two world wars. The island also is believed to have been
the site of the first Dutch settlement in the region. It received its
name because the British colonial governors lived there.</TE>
<TE>   In 1776, Gen. George Washington established a battery on the island
because of its strategic location. And until 1997 it served, in part, as
a Coast Guard regional headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, just before leaving office, President Clinton set
aside 20 acres of the island as a national monument, including two
fortresses on the site.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief remarks about his decision, Bush simply asserted that he
has the authority to transfer the property without congressional action.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at the law, looked at the circumstances, and decided this
morning that this is the right thing for the U.S. government and that
it's the right thing for the people of New York," the president said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), who hailed
Bush's announcement, said her doubts about the legality of selling a
national monument have not been allayed.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 balanced budget agreement, Congress specifically anticipated
up to $500 million in revenue from the sale of the island. But Clinton
reached an agreement with then-Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) for
Washington to sell it to New York for $1--if the city and the state could
agree on a detailed plan for the island's use.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House on Monday, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said a
final sales price has not been determined, saying only that it would be
"nominal" and "much less than $300 million," the low end of the estimated
market value.</TE>
<TE>   He also said Bush hopes the move will help the city recover
economically from the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 has left New York, especially the downtown area, in a very
difficult situation economically, and the president wants to make certain
that our nation's city, New York, is revitalized, and revitalized fully,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "So the president is helping New York to recover from the damage of
Sept. 11, and he's very pleased to be able to take this action."</TE>

<HD>'Cussing Canoeist' Law Overturned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheriff Jim Mosciski is dismayed. He is newly free to express that
emotion by cursing. But the freedom only makes him angrier.</LD>
<LD>   Mosciski, the sheriff of rural Arenac County in northern Michigan, was
a big fan of a 105-year-old state law barring the use of vulgar language
in front of women and children.</LD>
<LD>   A state appeals court Monday struck down the law, saying it trampled
on free speech rights. In the process, the judges dismissed a ticket a
Mosciski sheriff's deputy handed a cussing canoeist in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The canoeist, a young man named Timothy Boomer, admitted letting out a
few curse words after capsizing into the Rifle River during an outing
with friends. When his buddies began hooting, he let out a few more. They
laughed louder. He cursed louder. It became a game: "It was just clean
fun," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a sheriff's deputy patrolling the river disagreed. Noticing a
woman in a nearby canoe trying to shield her toddler's ears, the deputy
wrote Boomer up for violating a Michigan statute making it a misdemeanor
to use "indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language" in
front of women or children.</TE>
<TE>   Boomer was fined $75 and ordered to work four days in a child-care
program. Incensed, he appealed. On Monday, he was vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   The three-judge panel unanimously declared that the law was
unconstitutional. They wrote that it would be "difficult to conceive of a
statute that would be more vague." They added: "Allowing a prosecution
where one utters 'insulting' language could possibly subject a vast
percentage of the populace to a misdemeanor conviction."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Mosciski begs to differ.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good law. They should have left it alone," he said glumly.
"What gives a person the right to use that type of language around young
children?"</TE>
<TE>   Boomer's lawyer answers that query in three words: the 1st Amendment.
"The government can't act as the speech police and prosecute someone for
using certain language just because someone else got offended," said
William Street of the American Civil Liberties Union.</TE>
<TE>   The way Mosciski sees it, the paramount principle is personal
responsibility: Adults should act like adults and watch their language.
If it takes a law to keep them in line, then there ought to be a law.</TE>
<TE>   "Freedom of speech?" Mosciski said, "I don't buy it."</TE>

<LD>A teenager who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the
stabbing deaths of two Dartmouth College professors plans to change his
plea this week, apparently to guilty or no contest.</LD>
<LD>   The Superior Court in Haverhill announced Robert Tulloch, 18, would
change his plea at a hearing Thursday, hours before his alleged
accomplice is to be sentenced.</LD>
<LD>   Tulloch's best friend, James Parker, 17, is set to be sentenced for
his role in the killings, court records show. Parker pleaded guilty in
December as an accomplice to second-degree murder and agreed to testify
against Tulloch.</LD>

<HD>1930 Census Forms Give a Snapshot of History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>June Hall moved her finger down the page, found her grandmother's
name and smiled.</LD>
<LD>   After half an hour of scrolling through microfilm of personal records
from the 1930 census, Hall had hit pay dirt: the line that showed her
grandmother's house, the home in which Hall was born.</LD>
<LD>   Hall joined dozens of people Monday at the National Archives looking
to fill in the blanks of their family histories as privacy protection for
individual 1930 census records expired. The expiration, 72 years after
each census, allows people to see information beyond the dry statistics
typically available after the once-a-decade count.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a real high. You get into this and you just get hooked," said
Hall, of Baltimore. Although Hall had not been born by 1930, she read
that her grandmother lived on what was then a dirt road and her father
worked as a salesman and lived with her grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Historians billed it as the largest release of such personal records
by the federal government, providing a gold mine of genealogical data.</TE>
<TE>   "We get a picture more revealing than any previous census," John
Carlin, archivist of the United States, said before cutting the ribbon to
the dimly lighted census research room. "The census is still the most
complete record we have in our country at any single point in time."</TE>
<TE>   Historians said the records would provide a more detailed look at life
in America at the dawn of the Great Depression. The 1930 census date of
April 1 came about five months after the October 1929 stock market crash.</TE>
<TE>   All Americans answered the same 32 questions, including: What is your
name? How old are you? Where were you born?</TE>
<TE>   Some questions typified the times, including: "Does this household
have a radio set?"</TE>
<TE>   No forms were mailed. Census takers visited homes and recorded the
answers on a large answer grid that looked like a giant school report
card.</TE>
<TE>   Original 1930 forms have been destroyed, but copies were put on 2,667
rolls of microfilm in the 1940s. Those copies were made available at
archive headquarters in Washington and at 13 other archive offices around
the country, including Laguna Niguel in Southern California and San Bruno
in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the handwritten forms were easy to read. The form for the
White House in 1930, for instance listed Herbert Hoover as "head of
household." Occupation? "President of the United States."</TE>

<HD>Keep Airbus Jets Flying, Union Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The union representing American Airlines pilots says not enough
evidence exists to ground Airbus jets like the one that crashed in New
York in November after its tail fell off.</LD>
<LD>   The Allied Pilots Assn. said it was concerned about the accident but
disagreed with eight American Airlines pilots who asked the federal
government to consider grounding the Airbus A300-600.</LD>
<LD>   American Airlines and Airbus Industrie say the plane is safe. The
Federal Aviation Administration has ordered new inspections of the plane
but has not grounded it.</LD>
<TE>   American Flight 587 experienced several sharp side-to-side movements
before its tail fell off and the plane crashed shortly after taking off
from John F. Kennedy International Airport, killing 265 people.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA last month ordered inspections of A300-600 and A310 planes
that had experienced similar movements.</TE>
<TE>   The union asked for an FAA review of the procedures by which it
certifies airplanes as safe to fly, new procedures to test nonmetallic
composites for damage, new studies of turbulence caused by planes' taking
off, and that its pilots report all incidents of moderate or severe
turbulence and cases where the rudder moved by itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The union's leadership still has serious concerns about the events
surrounding the A300 accident," the group said in a statement. "That
noted, the association currently believes there is insufficient evidence
to recommend that AA ground the A300s."</TE>
<TE>   The union issued its statement after hearing a presentation from the
pilots and receiving a copy of their two-month study.</TE>

<HD>No Boost in Light-Truck Efficiency for 2004</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Sport utility vehicles and other light trucks manufactured for the
2004 model year will be required to get the same minimum average
requirement of 20.7 miles per gallon that has been in effect for a
generation, the U.S. Transportation Department said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected an attempt by some
Democrats to require American auto makers to boost the fuel efficiency of
gas-guzzling SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks by 50%.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate instead approved a weaker provision requiring the
Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to first consider the effect of higher fuel mileage
standards on passenger safety and auto industry job losses.</LD>
<TE>   By law, the government was required to issue a final rule Monday
setting light truck standards for model year 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said
environmental groups, the auto industry, lawmakers and other members of
the public have until May 8 to offer suggestions on possible changes to
federal mileage standards in 2005 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress adopted the original fuel standards nearly 30 years ago,
most Americans drove passenger cars. Today, however, more than half of
all new vehicles sold in the nation are SUVs, minivans or other light
trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups and many Democrats contend that stricter fuel
standards would save roughly the same amount of fuel as could be
extracted from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>

<HD>Wetland Backers Welcome Developer's Expansion Plan</HD>
<DH>Conservation: If deal goes through, Playa Vista would sell 193
acres to state and cut total housing in half.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been cut off from the ocean, chopped up by roads, buried
beneath truckloads of mud and silt. Yet, the remnants of the Ballona
Wetlands offer the best chance for a coastal wildlife refuge in an area
choked by urban sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   The main reason is simple: Along the coast of Los Angeles County,
there are no other major wetlands left to save from development.</LD>
<LD>   So conservationists long ago chose this drained and desiccated marsh
in West Los Angeles to make a last stand in a metropolis that has paved
over 95% of its wetlands.</LD>
<TE>   They have had successes. During a near quarter-century of
environmental battles, developers of Playa Vista have been forced to set
aside 340 acres for wildlife habitat, including 190 acres of salt marsh
and $13 million to help restore it.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad start, wetlands experts say. But it's hardly enough to
secure a refuge for wildlife at the foot of such a massive development.
Pocket wetlands tend to wither from the pollution, noise and light that
spill from the urban jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Playa Vista officials are willing to make another concession, for
a price. They will cut their housing development in half and sell enough
land to double the size of the salt marsh. The first step in the deal is
an appraisal, which is already underway.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed sale of 193 acres through the nonprofit Trust for Public
Land to the state government has fired the imaginations of those who have
envisioned these weedy bottom lands transformed into a lush oasis.</TE>
<TE>   "Bigger is better, when it comes to restoring tidal marsh," said Joy
Zedler, a leading wetlands ecologist.</TE>
<TE>   By doubling the acreage, and connecting it to another 68 acres of
state-controlled land, the wetlands would be big enough to encompass salt
marsh, intertidal mudflats and other wildlife shelter and feeding
grounds, ecologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Tidewater could meander through more than 400 acres, once the area is
properly engineered, with additional upland acres acting as a buffer
against urban intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   With the flow of rejuvenating tides, Ballona could once again be a
nursery for halibut, ecologists say. It could reclaim its role as a major
stopover for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway.</TE>
<TE>   It could be a place for the public to marvel at the smoky blue wings
of a giant heron as it fishes for supper; or for birders to spy on the
endangered Belding's savannah sparrow, nesting in the pickleweed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to dream about Ballona," said Zedler, a former San
Diego State University professor who now holds an endowed chair in
restoration ecology at the University of Wisconsin. "It could be so
important to the diversity of life in the region. It could be an oasis
for people, too."</TE>
<TE>   Wetlands ecologists, who have fought over Playa Vista's plans in the
past, share strikingly similar views on how easy it would be to rescue
the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The most important engineering work involves allowing seawater to
penetrate land that has been cut off from the ocean since Marina del Rey
was built in the early 1960s and Ballona Creek was lined with concrete.</TE>
<TE>   The engineering is relatively straightforward. All it would take is
opening the floodgates that line the creek, or building a few extra
culverts. The mouth of the creek is usually engulfed with seawater pushed
in by the tides.</TE>
<TE>   An experiment in the mid-1980s demonstrated how eager the ocean is to
reclaim this low-lying land. The Audubon Society opened floodgates for a
few hours to see what would happen.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fantastic," said Ed Tarvyd, a marine biology professor at
Santa Monica College who watched from atop a nearby bluff. Water quickly
deluged the area.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment worked a little too well. The seawater began to
inundate Culver Boulevard, forcing the hasty closure of the gates.</TE>
<TE>   Playa Vista's developers, in their own $13-million restoration plans,
propose installing automated floodgates that would shut to control tidal
flows.</TE>
<TE>   Other wetlands experts suggest a more costly solution. It would
involve elevating Culver Boulevard and building a berm along one edge of
the wetlands to protect low-lying buildings along the beach in Playa del
Rey. All this would be possible if the size of the salt marsh were
doubled under the deal pushed by the Trust for Public Land.</TE>
<TE>   Ecologists also strongly recommend removing the 15-foot-deep layer of
mud and silt dumped on a different portion of the land in the early 1960s
when the county dredged the harbor in the process of developing Marina
del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a site that humans have treated gently," said Michael N.
Josselyn, a wetlands restoration expert advising the Friends of Ballona.
"So it's not a site that a gentle hand could restore to its former
glory."</TE>
<TE>   Such extensive restoration would cost $100 million or more, experts
say. But once this land is put in the hands of an agency such as the
California Department of Parks and Recreation, many officials are
confident the money would begin to flow.</TE>
<TE>   "The actual restoration is easily doable, given a variety of funds
available," said Bob Hoffman, who handles such projects for the National
Marine Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   The Port of Los Angeles, for instance, must create new wetlands or
restore old ones to make up for what has been lost to port expansion. The
harbor agency has spent more than $100 million on wetlands restoration in
San Diego and Orange counties and now would like to find a project closer
to home.</TE>
<TE>   "Ballona would be a great thing to do for the city," said Ralph Appy,
the port's director of environmental management. "We are very interested
in doing some restoration there."</TE>
<TE>   Other money could come from federal offshore oil and gas lease revenue
and various state agencies that are flush with cash from Proposition 40,
which passed last month.</TE>
<TE>   The state Coastal Conservancy, for instance, has $240 million to spend
in coming years to buy and restore land.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the Coastal Conservancy's mission is to help resolve
long-standing land-use issues," said Sam Schuchat, the conservancy's
executive officer. "Ballona certainly qualifies. It would be nice to put
this baby to rest."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush welcomed thousands of
children and their parents to the White House on Monday for the Easter
Egg Roll--the first time the public had been invited inside the gates
since September.</LD>
<LD>   "Laura and I are so glad that you came this year, especially given
what happened last year," the president told the crowd, recalling showers
that forced the cancellation of last April's event and sent dripping
children and parents inside for a tour instead.</LD>
<LD>   "This is your home and you are welcome to the yard of your home," Bush
said. The grounds had been closed to the general public since the
terrorist attacks Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   This year's egg roll, in which young children raced to the finish line
while pushing eggs with a spoon, took place on a bright, windy day.</TE>
<TE>   Swarms of excited parents ushered wide-eyed children in pastel dresses
and Easter suits from activity to activity on the South Lawn, pointing
and snapping photos--some in front of an enormous jellybean mosaic of the
president's face.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Bush and several members of the Cabinet took turns throughout the
day reading to children.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon is considering a resumption of anthrax vaccinations
for U.S. troops now that the nation's sole maker of the vaccine has been
cleared to resume production.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Monday that he was awaiting
a recommendation on how and when to resume an inoculation program. He
said the details were being considered by Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who will forward his recommendation to
Rumsfeld.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld did not say definitively that the program would be restarted,
but other officials said Myers had received a recommendation that it be
phased in as soon as sufficient doses of vaccine are available.</LD>
<TE>   On Jan. 31, the Food and Drug Administration approved BioPort's new
manufacturing plant to produce anthrax vaccine. The Pentagon immediately
welcomed the approval but said it had not decided the future of its
immunization program, which in 1997 set a goal of immunizing all 2.4
million U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Rumsfeld indicated that vaccine shots were likely to
resume. He said he was preparing to make "final decisions about how it
might be reinstituted and when and on what basis."</TE>
<TE>   "There are a series of technical questions that are being looked at as
to how one might do it and in what format and in what sequence and those
types of things," he added. "It's an important issue, and goodness knows
you want to do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Four years of BioPort factory violations had left the Pentagon with
dwindling supplies and forced it to limit vaccinations to certain troops
on special missions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the problem with supplies, the Pentagon has kicked
hundreds of military personnel out of the service for refusing the shots.
Some who chose not to take the vaccine said they worried that it could be
connected to complaints of chronic fatigue, memory loss and other
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The government says the vaccine is safe, with rare occurrences of
severe side effects.</TE>

<HD>Woman on Death Row Allowed to End Appeals</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The Florida Supreme Court ruled Monday that one of the nation's
first known female serial killers is competent to fire her attorneys,
stop her appeals and accept her death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   In a brief unanimous order, the court also fired Aileen Wuornos'
state-appointed lawyers and dismissed her five appeals.</LD>
<LD>   A call to the legal office representing Wuornos was not immediately
returned. Lawyers from the Capital Collateral Regional Counsel had said
they wouldn't be able to represent her if the court ruled in her favor.</LD>
<TE>   Wuornos, 45, has spent a decade on Florida's death row. She was
sentenced to death six times for killing middle-aged men when she worked
as a prostitute along the highways of central Florida in 1989 and 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Wuornos has been the subject of a feature film, a television movie, an
opera and three books. She testified during her 1992 trial that she
killed men who assaulted her and made her fear for her life, but later
said she had lied.</TE>
<TE>   Since last spring, she had written Florida's high court several
letters expressing her desire to drop all appeals and be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are six cases which had all been unanimously decided for in
death, and of which I firmly agreed in with their final decision, since
I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again," Wuornos
wrote in one letter.</TE>
<TE>   One of her attorneys said Wuornos didn't understand the ramifications
of what she was doing and her behavior raised questions about her mental
health.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, a judge in Daytona Beach ruled that Wuornos was competent
to halt her appeals and fire her attorneys. The high court upheld that
ruling Monday.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate word from Gov. Jeb Bush's office as to when he
might sign a death warrant.</TE>
<TE>   "Her case is under review," Bush spokeswoman Katie Muniz said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida has executed only one woman since 1848--Judy Buenoano, who
died in the electric chair on March 30, 1998.</TE>

<DL>TRENTON, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>For 15 years, this city has had the dubious distinction of being
the only state capital without a hotel. That will change today when the
197-room Lafayette Yard Marriott Conference Hotel opens.</LD>
<LD>   "Not having a hotel was a message that gave people pause," said Sally
Lane, director of the Trenton Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. "People would
think, 'If you can't stay in a city, does that mean you wouldn't want to
go there?' "</LD>
<LD>   The city of about 85,000 becomes something of a ghost town at night
and on weekends, giving Trenton a reputation for being dangerous after
dark.</LD>
<TE>   About 20,000 state employees work here, but they generally leave when
their shifts end. Many stores in Trenton close by late afternoon during
the week and are closed altogether on weekends. There are no movie
theaters or department stores.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge who declared parts of Virginia's liquor law
unconstitutional put his ruling on hold Monday to allow state attorneys
time to appeal.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams last week threw out a number
of state liquor regulations and struck down sections of the code that
impose penalties for selling alcohol without a license.</LD>
<LD>   State law limits the importing of beer to those licensed to sell it.
Wine can be shipped from another state only to someone with a wholesale
wine license.</LD>
<TE>   Williams said the law was discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   One of the plaintiffs in the 1999 lawsuit, Franklin Houser of Dry
Comal Creek Vineyards in New Braunfels, Texas, said Virginia's
alcohol-distribution laws create a monopoly-like market that hurts small
producers and restricts consumer choice.</TE>

<HD>Son Arraigned in Beating of Father, a State Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>The son of a New Hampshire Supreme Court justice was accused Monday
of pounding his father in the face with a guitar after hours of drinking.</LD>
<LD>   John Christian Broderick, 30, was arraigned on an assault charge and
ordered held on $100,000 bond.</LD>
<LD>   Justice John Broderick, 54, was attacked in his sleep early Saturday,
beaten so severely that a top state official could not recognize him. He
was in serious condition Monday with broken facial bones after six hours
of surgery the day before.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the son had blood on his clothes and was so intoxicated
that they took him to a hospital for observation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most severe attacks our office has seen," Assistant
Atty. Gen. William Delker said.</TE>
<TE>   Delker said the son left the condominium and threw the guitar away
after the attack; he would not say whether police had found it, nor would
he say if the guitar was a hollow acoustic instrument or a heavier
electric guitar.</TE>
<TE>   The assault followed a daylong argument between father and son,
according to court papers. The elder Broderick went to bed after his son
apologized, but the younger man began drinking whiskey.</TE>
<TE>   "The more he drank, the more he stewed about the fight," Delker said.
"He eventually decided to attack his father while he slept."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the younger man returned to the house after the
beating and asked police officers if his father was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Delker said the younger Broderick was on probation for a robbery in
Massachusetts. He pleaded guilty Feb. 26 and also pleaded guilty recently
to disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in New Hampshire in an
incident that involved alcohol, Delker said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the elder Broderick was charged with slapping his son,
according to court records. The charge was later dropped.</TE>
<TE>   When that case came to court, a prosecutor said the incident had begun
when the elder Broderick told his son he had eight weeks to move out. His
son allegedly replied, "You have eight hours until you're in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Broderick blamed the incident on his son's drinking.</TE>
